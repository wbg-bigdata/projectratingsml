F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
KDP-3 has overall development objectives of reducing poverty and improving local-level
governance in rural Indonesia. It is part of a long-term village governance program that
began with the first Kecamatan project in 1998.

Specific development objectives for KDP-3 include: (i) institutionalizing participatory
processes in local government; (ii) the cost effective provision of basic social and
economic infrastructure; (iii) strengthening the capacity of the micro-finance institutions
developed under KDP-1 and KDP-2 to manage and monitor funds sustainably.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority)
Restructuring of Credit 38060 (part of KDP-3A) added another specific development
objective: (iv) reconstruction of communities in areas affected by natural disasters. This
additional specific DO was also included in KDP-3B and the associated AF.

Preamble

In June 2003, the Board of the World Bank formally approved the disbursement of
US$249.8 million through the KDP-3 loan and credit program. However, following the
Board’s approval, the Indonesian parliament tabled major revisions to the country's
decentralization laws. Had the tabled revisions come into effect, sub-national projects,
including KDP-3, could not have been implemented by government agencies. Because of
the uncertainty created by the tabled revisions, KDP-3 was divided into two separate
loans/projects.

Initially, the project was scaled back and redefined as KDP-3A. A proposal for this new,
scaled-back program was sent to the Bank’s Board, where it was passed on a no-
objection basis in May 2004 as a loan and credit scheme involving the equivalent of
US$91 million. This sum was sufficient to provide funding for one year, enough to
continue field operations while the contentious laws were being debated in parliament.

Following the election of a new president and a new parliament in August 2004, the risk
of major revisions to the decentralization laws receded. Given these new circumstances,
the government determined to proceed to scale up the project. Loan and credit funds
totaling the equivalent of US$160 million were approved in March 2005.

Despite this restructuring of KDP-3, there were no changes in the development objectives,
project components, or implementation structure defined in the original KDP-3 project
originally approved by the Bank’s Board in June 2003.

In April 2006, the Government announced its intention to establish a national anti-
poverty program. One component of the proposed program was the “National Program
for Community Empowerment? (PNPM–Mandiri) intended to benefit the poor in both
rural and urban areas. At this point, the government needed funds to implement a
transition phase of the rural program. In May 2007, the Bank approved additional
financing (AF) to KDP-3B through the provision of credit equivalent to US$123 million.
Again, the development objectives, project components and implementation
arrangements of KDP-3B remained the same as those defined in the original KDP-3,
apart from the addition of an emergency reconstruction subcomponent for communities
in areas afflicted by natural disasters.

Although KDP-3A and KDP-3B received funding as separate projects, they were
implemented as a single program, with identical development objectives, project
components and implementation arrangements. Therefore, this Implementation
Completion Report (ICR) covers both stages of the original project proposal (KDP-
3A and KDP-3B), as well as KDP-3B (AF). As far as the Indonesian government is
concerned, the different KDP / PNPM projects are components of a single, ongoing
program with annual government budgets and outputs.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country and Sector Background: KDP-3A and KDP-3B are a continuation of a
Community Driven Development (CDD) program for rural areas throughout Indonesia.
The government first initiated this program in the mid 1980s with a series of labor-
intensive public works programs to develop local infrastructure.

For several decades, the New Order government achieved remarkable results in poverty
reduction. It achieved these results largely by ensuring macro-stability for growth and by
implementing large-scale targeted programs. However, by the early 1990’s, the rate of
poverty reduction had declined considerably. To overcome the constraints to poverty
reduction created by the highly centralized system of government, senior policy makers
endorsed a new generation of transfer programs that were intended to provide local
governments and communities with control over and responsibility for a portion of
development resources.

The most well-known of these was a program established by presidential decree known
as the Left-Behind Villages (IDT) program. This program was intended to provide direct
transfers of funds to village heads for programs to improve the material welfare of local
residents. The Indonesian government sought the assistance of the World Bank to
monitor IDT and to complement the livelihoods programs with a Village Infrastructure
Project (VIP). This latter program was specifically intended to improve market linkages
for poor communities throughout Java and, later, in Sumatra.



                                             2
KDP-1 was designed while the former President Suharto still held office. It was finally
approved in June 1998, shortly after Suharto resigned, with KDP-1 being followed by
KDP-2. Simultaneously, a parallel set of Bank-supported Urban Poverty Projects (UPPs)
projects were implemented in urban areas. The KDP program was built on Indonesia’s
long tradition of providing resources to support plans made by local governments and
communities through various kinds of block grant transfers. The key innovation in these
programs was the allocation of resources directly to local communities and the
socialization of the program through a network of independent community and technical
facilitators. Both innovations were intended to reduce the severe negative impact of poor
civil service performance and the high levels of government corruption.

Because of the Asian financial and economic crisis of 1997, the KDP program was scaled
up much more rapidly than initially planned, with coverage rising from approximately
2,000 villages to approximately 12,000 villages in slightly more than a year. The scaling
up of the program was facilitated by strong support from Bappenas and the Ministry of
Home Affairs; intensive World Bank monitoring and assistance; and the project’s high
level of popularity. The program’s coverage was expected to increase to approximately
30,000 villages by 2005, a number equal to slightly less than half the total number of
rural villages in Indonesia. The project received substantial grant support from donors,
with allocations of funds from national and local government budgets steadily increasing
even after Indonesia's recovery from the East Asian financial crisis.

Under the KDP’s scale-up strategy, it was intended to eventually return the program to
the national planning and budgeting system. KDP’s first phase (KDP-1) was intended to
facilitate the establishment of a bottom-up planning process, while the second phase
(KDP-2) concentrated on improving the technical and managerial capacities of the
participating sub-districts and villages. This increase in capacities was to be achieved
through various forms of technical assistance, training, and practical exercises. KDP-3,
the series of projects that are subject of this ICR, was designed to provide the legal and
administrative framework for institutionalizing the KDP system within the national and
local government planning procedures.

Among the broad range of sector-specific issues, KDP-1 and KDP-2 had addressed
sectoral issues with respect to community development, technical capacity and fiduciary
concerns. In turn, KDP-3 was intended to specifically address two important institutional
dimensions within the KDP program: (i) the establishment of a more solid legal and
administrative foundation on which to base a system of village empowerment; and (ii) the
provision of a rationalized management framework to facilitate the implementation of a
system of community microfinance. The KDP program provides block grants to finance
economically productive activities, which are identified through bottom-up and
participatory development planning and using the Community Driven Development
(CDD) approach. It has been the hallmark of Indonesia’s CDD interventions and is the
largest Bank-financed CDD program in the world.

Rationale for Bank Involvement: Firstly, the Bank was able to add value to the program
through the provision of oversight in an extraordinarily poor fiduciary environment.

                                            3
Thus, the Bank’s involvement was expected to contribute greatly to the effective use of
development resources. Bank supervision missions would provide additional oversight
and support to improve financial and program management.

Secondly, Indonesian government agencies do not normally carry out very rigorous
monitoring and evaluation of programs. Constantly evolving projects, such as KDP,
require much more intense monitoring and evaluation because of their wide geographical
coverage, diverse sectoral scope and the need to have real-time information on the
progress of implementation.

Thirdly, a high value was attached to learning what worked and didn't work in the
implementation of KDP in order to make procedural and policy improvements. The Bank
provided assistance to the Indonesian government to use quantitative and qualitative
measurements to improve the program’s design. While such studies were generally
recognized as valuable, they would not have been conducted without Bank involvement.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
KDP-3 has overall development objectives of reducing poverty and improving local-level
governance in rural Indonesia.

Specific development objectives for KDP-3 include:
   (i)     Institutionalizing participatory processes in local government;
   (ii)    The cost effective provision of basic social and economic infrastructure;
   (iii) Strengthening the capacity of the micro-finance institutions developed under
           KDP-1 and KDP-2 to manage and monitor funds sustainably.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators
The PDO of the second project specifically included provisions for reconstruction in
communities of Aceh and North Sumatra that were affected by the earthquake and
tsunami in December 2004. Since these provisions were compatible with the community-
driven development principles, design, and implementation arrangements of the original
project, the inclusion of this objective in KDP-3B is not inconsistent with combining the
assessment of both projects in one report.

Although the PDO for KDP-3B was truncated in the original PAD data sheet, it was
included in its entirety in the text of the PAD and in a slightly different form in the credit
agreement. The full PDO was also stated in the project paper data sheet for KDP-3B-AF,
as follows:

   “KDP-3 has the overall development objectives of reducing poverty and improving
   local level governance in rural Indonesia through: (a) institutionalization of
   participatory processes in local government; (b) cost-effective provision of basic
   social and economic infrastructure; (c) strengthening of the capacity of micro-finance
   institutions to manage and monitor funds in a sustainable manner; (d) reconstruction
   of communities in areas affected by natural disasters.?



                                              4
There are minor differences between the PDO statements in the three appraisal
documents (and in to their corresponding legal agreements). However, in the interests of
transparency, clarity, and proper reporting, only the final version of the PDO statement is
examined in the ICR, as attempting to report and evaluate slightly dissimilar PDOs would
be unnecessarily confusing while providing little, if any, value to the assessment.

Similarly, the key indicators are reported separately in the separate ICR Data Sheets for
KDP-3A and KDP-3B (including the AF), but are discussed as a single project outcome
in the body of the ICR.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The main intended beneficiaries of the project were the rural poor. The project was
intended to benefit the rural poor by reducing poverty through improved access to social
and economic infrastructure. In addition, the project would assist local government
institutions at the village, sub-district and district levels by (i) improving the
responsiveness of these institutions; (ii) improving the quality of services provision; and
(iii) reducing corruption. Additionally, the rural poor were to benefit through improved
access to, and better financial management of, local microfinance institutions. Identified
vulnerable groups, including women and the poorest community members, were to
benefit through a greater level of participation in the planning and selection process.

1.5 Original Components
The original project appraisal documents (PAD) for KDP-3A and KDP-3B showed six
project components, although the sixth component was actually an incremental operation
cost. Thus, the results indicators are organized for the five components only. The project
paper (PP) for the KDP-3B additional financing to find five major components, shown
below:

Component 1: Block grants to kecamatan: Block grants were transferred directly from
the special account to the sub-districts participating in KDP. This component included
sub-components for investment grants and village planning grants, as described below. A
third sub-component for reconstruction grants in communities devastated by natural
disasters was added through the inclusion of an amendment to the credit agreement.

   A. Block Investment Grants to Villages: These grants provided two years of
   continued program support in 592 sub-districts which had already received three
   years of support through KDP-1 and KDP-2. New sub-districts were only eligible for
   those which emerged from proliferation of KDP-1/ KDP-2 sub-districts. A limited
   number of additional eligibility criteria apply to new sub-districts:

      Sub-districts in new high poverty districts that were previously ineligible for
       KDP;
      Post-conflict areas where KDP provided the platform for other post conflict
       services;
      Sub-districts proposed by districts for full funding from their own budgets but
       where TA for design and supervision was requested.

                                            5
   The value of block grants was equal to approximately US$55,000, US$75,000, or
   US$110,000 per sub-district, based on the sub-districts’ population and location.
   These sums also covered operating costs for facilitators and some incremental and
   government operational costs.

   B. Kecamatan planning grants: These grants supported the village and kecamatan
   participatory planning process by allowing villagers to develop a cadre of self-
   selected social and technical facilitators. Other activities funded through this
   component include village cross-audits; preparation of dissemination materials; and
   the costs of local travel.

Component 2: Developing community and local government: This component is
intended to support activities to strengthen the local government councils formed under
Laws 22 and 25, with a particular focus on the strengthening of Village Representative
Forum (BPD), Inter-village Forums (MAD), and the district parliaments. The majority of
resources allocated under this component were intended to finance the operations of
community and technical facilitators and their training. These facilitators are recruited
from the private sector. They receive project management training followed by periodic
refresher courses. Other activities supported by this component include: technical
assistance for BPD capacity development; training in administration and monitoring
skills to reinforce village administration; and village-level civic information and
education programs to raise awareness concerning decentralization. Local governments
contribute to financing the local regulations development processes.

Component 3: Support to village micro-finance institutions (UPK): This component
provides support for the organizational and financial development of local financial
institutions (UPK) that manage the revolving funds accumulated through participation in
KDP projects. Support under this component was limited to training, technical assistance
and supervision for existing UPK, focusing on the effective and efficient use of the
currently existing funds to let loan funds grow.

Component 4: Implementation support: This component provides support for the
provision of technical assistance for project administration at the national, provincial, and
district level governments. Consultants were engaged to support technical activities,
including a national management consultant. Additional activities funded through this
component include training courses in legislative drafting and support to PMD for the
implementation of overall project evaluations. The Indonesian government’s
contributions related to the overall management, coordination, monitoring and
supervision at national, provincial, district and sub-district levels.

Component 5: Studies, evaluation, and special programs: In addition to the
Management Information System (MIS), this component funded a program of poverty
impact assessments using quantitative and qualitative methods; continued support for the
Justice for the Poor program initiated under KDP-2; pilot programs for community-based
monitoring; and a long term maintenance study to examine village capacities. Studies

                                             6
related to village and sub-district revenue generation, trade, and infrastructure were
proposed at appraisal but were not implemented.

Component 6: Operational costs: This component funded the costs of incremental
travel to visit KDP field sites and of consumables for MOHA’s National KDP Secretariat.
It also included the costs of workshops with local government officials and cross-country
study tours for policy-makers to visit innovative community projects.

Figures for the allocations by component (i.e. Bank and government funds combined) are
not available because a large amount of additional financing was not allocated
specifically to the various components. The summary table below shows the allocations
of Bank funds only by categories, which more or less correspond to the above
components.

Actual disbursements were close to the original allocations, except that expenditure on
block grants was approximately US$30 million less than allocated, while expenditure on
consultants was approximately US$30 million more than allocated, with these consultants
consisting mainly of facilitators at all levels, especially at the sub-district level. The
additional expenditure on facilitators is justified by the fact that KDP-3 provided
facilitators not just for KDP-3 block grants but also for emergency reconstruction and for
the various government programs (such as the establishment of PNPM) and the three
provincial programs.

1.6 Revised Components
As mentioned above, KDP-3B also included a small additional subcomponent
(subcomponent C under component 1) to provide funds for emergency reconstruction.
These initial reconstruction funds were subsequently complemented by a large grant from




                                                                  7
the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDF) and from a number of bilateral grants, and a separate
project specifically intended for emergency reconstruction and was established1. KDP-
3B-AF added a small subcomponent to finance an evaluation to determine whether the
poverty reduction facilitated by the KDP program would have an impact on MDG
performance indicators. Under KDP-3B-AF,minor rearrangements of the components
were instituted: while still funding the same set of activities, the maximum block grant
per sub-district was increased by 20 percent to the equivalent of approximately
US$132,000.

1.7 Other significant changes
As stated in the preamble to this ICR, approximately a year after the original approval of
the KDP program that prior to its implementation, the value of the original loan/credit
was scaled back significantly due to the political and legal uncertainty created by
proposed revisions to the decentralization law. Subsequently, however, when this
uncertainty had been resolved, funding for KDP-3B was approved, with the total value of
the two phases more or less equaling the original value of the loan/credit amounts.
Subsequently, when the Indonesian government announced its intention to launch a
national KDP program (the PNPM-Mandiri program), substantial additional financing
(AF) for KDP-3B was approved by the Bank to facilitate the transition to the new
program.

Substantial bilateral donor support became available between 2005 and 2008, with the
combined KDP-3 project attracting a total of eleven trust funds (TF) that were linked to
the KDP-3 loans/credits. Four different donors provided a total of approximately
US$24.5 million in grant funding. The TFs were intended to support KDP-3’s PDO and
to finance a wide range of interventions. These interventions, some of them regional,
included initiatives to improve communications and education for poor children; to
facilitate smallholder agribusiness development; to foster environmental training and
awareness; to reduce poverty; to encourage women’s participation in leadership; and to
provide technical training for new facilitators (“barefoot engineers?) in Papua and West
Papua. More details on these TFs are provided in Annex 10.

In December 2008, the closing dates for both KDP-3A and 3B (including AF) were
extended by 12 months to December 31, 2009.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The KDP program is a series of projects that, and each new stage, introduces
improvements based on the lessons learnt from earlier and ongoing operations. The KDP-



1
 The disbursement records show that only a small portion of the re-allocated funds were spent on block
grants because GOI preferred to use all available grant resources for reconstruction investments. However,
all implementation support for reconstruction in communities in the devastated areas was funded by KDP-3
sources.

                                                    8
3B PAD contains a comparative table that shows how the program has evolved,
progressing from KDP-1 to KDP-3, and incorporating the lessons from earlier operations.
Lessons learnt relate to the necessity for more technical training and oversight; reduced
technical complexity; user-friendly formats for reporting and financial management; a
better system of incentives and sanctions; better support for regulations and formal
procedures to strengthen governance; increased sustainability of micro-finance
institutions; more external monitoring; and an improved system of monitoring and
evaluation. Some risks, such as inadequate regulations, the lack of matching grants by
local governments, and the lack of local human resources, had been identified and
addressed. However, the challenge of the massive scaling up of KDP-3 had not been fully
appreciated and, therefore, caused some implementation problems and delays.

Government commitment was very strong as evidenced by the adoption of KDP as a
national program (PNPM-Mandiri) in August 2006 during the implementation of KDP-3.

2.2 Implementation
Overall, implementation went well. This was mainly due to the prior experience of the
various project actors with KDP: government officials were familiar with KDP and, with
its participatory and transparent approach, it was popular with communities. In addition,
several thousand trained and experienced facilitators were available. As happened in most
GoI-funded projects in 2005 due the transition of administration and introduction of new
budget regulation, issuance of government budget were delayed by four months or more.
As a result, initial socialization activities associated with KDP-3 only began in April
2005, leaving less time to complete planning and implementation activities.

Although not formally termed a mid-term review (MTR), the Bank supervision mission
that concluded in September 2006 was an MTR in every way but in name. The mission
took place soon after the President's announcement of the government's intention to
launch PNPM-Mandiri. It focused on a number of issues, including the challenges of
scaling up; on reconstruction components (for Aceh-Nias and the Java earthquake); KDP
in Papua; M&E issues (see below); improving FM, and the speedy resolution of
complaints related to corruption. KDP-3 was never accorded “Project at Risk? status.

In addition to the events described in the preamble (i.e. the initial scaling back of the
KDP-3A loan and the subsequent approval of KDP-3B and KDP-3B-AF), a formal
restructuring of the KDP-3A credit was conducted in early 2005 in response to the series
of natural disasters in Indonesia, especially the earthquake-tsunami that devastated Aceh
in December 2004. With KDP already operational in almost 40 percent of the sub-
districts in Aceh, with a large network of facilitators in place, two new sub-components
for investment block grants and for planning grants were added to provide an emergency
cycle of funds for disaster-affected villages in Aceh. Approximately US$9 million
equivalent were re-allocated from general block grants to emergency reconstruction
grants, and an additional PDO was introduced (see 1.3 above). The amended credit
agreement became effective on April 29, 2005.




                                           9
The earlier KDP projects did not require local governments to share in the costs of the
program. However, KDP-3 stipulated that, depending to their fiscal capacity, local
governments were required to contribute between 20 to 70 percent of the total value of
the investment block grants, with this requirement being institutionalized by government
regulations. As a result, the total value of local government contributions from their own
budget sources amounted to approximately US$65 million. Also, the sum of voluntary
contributions from communities, called swadaya and consisting mainly of labor and
locally sourced materials, reached approximately 4 percent2 of the total value of block
grants disbursed to villages.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
KDP-3 used a multi-level and multi-activity, internal and external monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) system that was developed on the basis of lessons learnt from earlier
projects. The MIS is the core of the internal system, while external monitoring was
provided through independent provincial NGOs and an independent media. However, the
MIS was instituted without anticipating the rapid scaling up of the program. The MIS
suffered from a number of systemic issues, including lack of clarity on key indicators to
be monitored; staffing issues; issues with customization of software; and hardware
problems. Although detailed project data were readily available at the local level, the
information did not flow up smoothly, and there was also a lack of level-by-level
consolidation checks on data quality. The MTR mission in September 2006 did a review
of the entire M&E system and made a number of recommendations to be implemented by
January 2007 in anticipation of the scaling up the operation. These recommendations
related to raising the quality of MIS staff; improving MIS hardware; integrating data into
a single database; and strengthening the FM unit.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Environment
Due to the very small scale of the infrastructure projects involved, no formal
environmental impact analyses were required for KDP sub-project investments. However,
the environmental and social impact of such subprojects was nonetheless considered. The
project used standard formats and procedures, such as a checklist of impacts that was
completed initially, at project identification. Follow-up checks were routinely conducted
later, during and following project implementation. There was no systematic monitoring
and reporting related to the implementation of environmental safeguards, although an
extensive sample review conducted between 2006 and 2008 showed that only a very
small proportion of cases involved serious negative environmental impacts3.



2
 The borrower’s report in Annex 7 reports a “swadaya? contribution of six percent; this difference may be
due to the difficulty in capturing, valuing and reporting all voluntary community contributions that are
mainly in-kind.
3
 The sample of 331 villages in 95 sub-districts in all provinces in Eastern Indonesia showed that only 2
percent of the subprojects had environmental impacts rated as “high? (lack of road drainage, surface water
pollution); “medium? impacts were observed in 9 percent of the sample, and 45 percent showed “low?, i.e.
only minor impacts.

                                                   10
Social Safeguards
There were no reports of cases of involuntary land acquisition or loss of assets. It is very
likely that such cases would have been brought to light through KDP’seffective
complaints mechanisms (see below under Anti-corruption Measures).At the subproject
identification stage, a checklist of possible compensation, if any, is prepared for land and
assets (fruit trees, crops, etc) utilised or affected by the sub-project. In most cases, such
assets are donated voluntarily by the owners,who perceive the benefits for themselves
and their community as outweighing any potential loss. Without such mutually
satisfactory agreements, the subproject would not be permitted to proceed to further
priority discussion in the inter-village meeting forum. In general, throughout KDP, a very
limited amount of private land is sometimes utilised for subprojects (for road widening,
public toilet, spring capture, etc).

Nonetheless, a better system of records of social and environmental screening and
monitoring of subprojects should have been implemented, with documentation to record
voluntary land donations to allow proper inventory of the new assets developed through
the program.

Procurement
Consulting firms were selected through a competitive process to provide administrative
and logistical services to 140 oversight consultants at the national and provincial level
and 2,650 facilitators at the district and sub-district level. These consultants and
facilitators were individually contracted by the PMU. Successful firms received a
management fee for their services. Consulting firms that performed well that had been
selected competitively for an earlier KDP project were appointed single-source. For
village infrastructure subprojects, the proven system of community procurement was
implemented. Procurement was managed by village-level implementation committees,
using forms and procedures as reviewed and agreed by the Bank and established in the
KDP project management manual.

Financial Management
Fiduciary compliance was generally good, with external audit reports by the central
government’s audit agency (BPKP) expressing unqualified approval of the financial
statements except for FY 2005, when there was an under-statement of the Special
Account and some payments had been debited to KDP-2 in error. For FY 2006, more
than 75 percent had been followed up by the project 4 . However, findings related to
financial reports from FY 2007 and 2008 drew attention to internal control weaknesses
and some problems with community records and payment verification. Other problems
related to several overpayments; non-compliance on a few block grant disbursements;
and inadequate monitoring of consultants’ work. In addition to checks by responsible
Indonesian government agencies, the Bank’s regular financial management (FM)
supervision missions conducted checks on the resolution of all these issues.



4
 Bank FM supervision rated FM as moderately satisfactory in 09/2005, moderately unsatisfactory in
06/2008, moderately satisfactory again in 12/2008, and satisfactory in 06/2010.

                                               11
Anti-Corruption Measures
KDP-3 used a comprehensive complaints mechanism to deal with corruption-related
issues. By 2007, specialists had been appointed to handle complaints and attached to each
provincial management consultant office. While communities or individuals could submit
complaints in various ways, including by text messages (SMS), there was still a
reluctance to report problems. In addition, facilitators and other project actors lacked the
skills required to handle complaints well. Out of approximately 1,900 cases reported, of
which more than half related to the misuse of funds5 and 70 percent related to revolving
loan funds, the NMC’s complaints handling unit was able to close 56 percent of them,
recovering almost US$1.9 million. The outstanding cases are still being pursued,
including a portion that are slowly making their way through the police and court system.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
Subprojects were handed over to the villages immediately after completion as part of the
normal project cycle. There was also an operations and maintenance (O&M) meeting
organized with each community close to the completion of the works, with an O&M
committee being formed. This committee often comprises the same members as the
implementation committee. For revenue-generating facilities, such as water supply,
markets, and irrigation, a village-level utility was set up to manage the funds and O&M
activities. Despite these efforts to establish adequate O&M capacities, especially for
roads (the most popular infrastructure investment and also the most difficult and costly to
maintain with community resources alone), no formal institutional arrangements were
made, nor were there any budget provisions for ongoing maintenance and repairs. In
contrast, a 2009 review of KDP/PNPM community water supply systems showed that,
generally, water project maintenance is good, and technical and financial capacities,
paired with the communities’ willingness to perform O&M, are adequate to keep such
systems going. The main problems found in the study related to poor design and
construction.

As mentioned above, KDP-3 was scheduled to terminate in 2008, after the Indonesian
government launched the PNPM-Mandiri Rural national program as a follow-on program
in 2007. There was some overlap during 2007, but the transition from KDP to PNPM was
almost seamless.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The KDP program was a key component of the Bank’s support to Indonesia’s poverty
reduction and decentralization program. As such, it therefore had high relevance to the
CAS. The project aimed to strengthen the ability of communities across Indonesia to plan
and manage local development initiatives. The program was established on a recognition
that local communities were capable of producing high-quality, economically useful



5
    Most of the remainder of complaints was related to abuse of authority which did not involve money.

                                                     12
social and economic infrastructure investments. Furthermore, it recognized that district
level agencies concentrated their resources on technically more complex and higher-value
programming. Equally important for a transitional country such as Indonesia was the fact
that participatory development programs, such as KDP, provided local governments with
concrete examples of alternative systems to manage decentralization.KDP-3 PDOs tied in
well with two of the three main CAS goals in 2003: (i) improving governance and (ii)
reducing poverty. But KDP also fitted in with the overall CAS strategy of maintaining a
low profile while Indonesia sorted its way through the New Order legacy and the
resulting institutional turmoil. Thus, KDP was a key part of the Bank’s support to
Indonesia's massive decentralization program.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (including brief discussion of
causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in Annex 2)
KDP was significantly successful in achieving its primary objective of reducing poverty
and improving local governance. A quantitative impact evaluation study 6 conducted
between August/October 2007 (baseline) and February/March 2010 (end line) showed
real consumption gains in households in KDP/PNPM areas to be 5 to 10 percent higher
than in non-KDP/PNPM areas7. Households that were poor in 2007 had about a 2.5
percent higher likelihood of graduating from poverty than control households8. Local
governance has improved, as evidenced by thousands of cost-effective subprojects that
were implemented in a participatory and transparent manner.

The project also achieved an additional development objective that of reconstruction of
communities in devastated areas. More than 2,500 activities (outputs) were recorded for
“post-disaster? areas (see summary table Annex 2). Only a small portion of the re-
allocated funds were used, because the Indonesian government preferred to use grant
funds for reconstruction, such as the separate KDP project financed by Multilateral
Donor Fund (MDF) for Aceh and Nias.

However, the project was less successful in institutionalizing these participatory
processes in the regular local government structures. Strengthening the capacities of
micro-finance institutions was also less successful, although the repayment rates for
women’s savings and loan groups were high.



6
 The PNPM Impact Evaluation covers the period 2007-2010. It utilizes a quasi-experimental matching
design with household panel in which a control group was constructed using existing Indonesian census
and social survey data. The same households were interviewed in 2007 and 2010 and a difference-in-
difference matching estimation approach was used to determine impacts. The results represent average
treatment effects for the treated across all households in 150 project sub-districts. These results are used as
a proxy for all sub-districts that participated in KDP-3.
7
  Since the KDP-3 and the PNPM projects were being implemented in parallel for a period of time, and
were indeed overlapping, the outcomes cannot be meaningfully separated but are considered to fairly
reflect outcomes from KDP-3.
8
 The study was unable to assess to what extent poor households in wealthy kecamatans are benefitting from
the program. 

                                                     13
3.3 Efficiency
No economic return analysis had been conducted specifically for this project. However, a
2005 study, conducted for KDP-2, showed that typical KDP-type infrastructure achieved
EIRRs well in excess of 30 percent, with an average of 53 percent. Nothing significant
has changed since 2005 in the way projects have been selected, prioritized, planned and
implemented. Therefore, the results of the 2005 economic evaluation are likely to remain
valid. That 2005 study also showed that KDP-type village infrastructure had significant
positive impacts on the economies of the villages analyzed, although theprogram is less
effective in less poor area. In addition, significant savings were achieved through the use
of village labor and construction management compared to similar, contractor-built
infrastructure. Least cost prices were achieved by the KDP standard program requirement
that for larger goods items, villages had to obtain competitive quotes from three suppliers.
On average, community-implemented KDP infrastructure projects cost 30 to 56 percent
less than those executed by contractors.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
Although not all PDOs have been fully achieved, the key poverty reduction objective was
met, as proven by a recently concluded impact evaluation study. The 2010 impact
evaluation study showed that in KDP/PNPM areas, there were real per capita
consumption gains and a significantly higher proportion of poor families graduating from
poverty. The physical targets of providing cost-effective infrastructure were exceeded, as
the following figures demonstrate: (i) more than 18,000 villages implemented a range of
subprojects in accordance with their needs; (ii) the EIRR ranged above 30 percent; and
(iii) there were more than 18 million beneficiaries. Also, the project was highly relevant,
as shown by the Indonesian government's adoption of KDP during the implementation
period of this project series as its national community empowerment program (PNPM).
In fact, Bank loan and credit funds, as well as trained and experienced project staff and
other resources, were used to launch GoI’s program in 2007.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The positive impact on poverty reduction has been impressive, as briefly mentioned
above. The evaluation study conducted between 2007 and 2010 found real consumption
gains in households in KDP/PNPM areas to be 5 to 10 percent higher than in non-PNPM
areas. It also concluded that households that were poor in 2007 had about a 2.5 percent
higher likelihood of graduating from poverty than the control households. In terms of
access to services, the likelihood of a sick person utilizing outpatient care in 2010 is 6 to
8 percent higher in KDP/PNPM areas than in control areas. Finally, there is evidence
from this 2010 impact evaluation study that labor force participants in KDP/PNPM areas
were one to two percent more likely to gain employment in the period from 2007 to 2010.
These findings are consistent with similar results from a study on KDP-2 conducted
between 2002 and 2007. The level of participation of the poor in planning meetings
reached an average of 63 percent, as an extra effort was being made in KDP-3 to identify
the poor and ensure that their real needs were being met through the village proposals.


                                             14
The microfinance component was also intended to address poverty, especially among
women, through women’s savings and loan groups (SPP). However, it appears that it was
difficult to target the poor with small loans. KDP-3 provided microfinance funds for
women’s groups (SPP) only. Women took full advantage of this opportunity, and there
were almost 13,000 such groups active at the end of 2007. SPPs consistently achieved an
average repayment rate of approximately 94 percent.

The rate of participation of women at KDP meetings ranged from 28 to 44 percent, rising
to 90 percent for the “women’s special forum?. Two of the three proposals from each
village were prepared by the women's forum, with one of them being for capital for
women’s savings and loan groups SPP. Women’s proposals were discussed and decided
upon in a special women-only village meeting. These were then forwarded to the full
village assembly meeting, at which they were described and discussed. However, the
women’s proposals were automatically forwarded to the sub-district for processing.
Whether women’s proposals were funded or not depended on the decision of the inter-
village forums (MAD). In any case, the program was clearly successful at identifying
women’s priorities, creating a greater responsiveness to women’s needs. Project
procedures and annual cycles of block grants also helped to increase the number of
women selected as TPK or UPK members, or for other public positions. Reports from the
field also showed that community-based monitoring by women groups was more
effective.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
KDP’s major contributions to institutional strengthening are difficult to quantify but
nevertheless important. Prior to the VIP/KDP series of programs, Indonesia had little
experience with or interest in community development. Over the life of the program, this
view changed dramatically. Sectoral programs in education and health, for example, built
up their own sector-specific approaches to community engagement. These drew on the
lessons learned from KDP, and were even based on the procedures and formats that had
been developed for this program. By the close of the bulk of the KDP-3 projects in 2008,
community development had become an organizing principle for the government’s
overall medium term expenditure plan as well as its national strategy for poverty
reduction. While not all of these changes can be attributed to KDP, this program’s high
profile and measured results made an important contribution to this overall change in
government thinking.

However, while participation, access to information, transparency and general
governance are used to good purpose within project processes, these do not usually spill
over to other areas of village development and governance. While women and the poor
are included in the process, the quality of participation in decision-making and
implementation is still limited. Thus, much of the decision-making is still conducted
within the elite power structure of the village. Facilitators probably did not focus on the
empowerment of non-elite groups to a sufficient degree.

Capacity has been built widely through training and on-the-job experience in three
separate sectors: (i) village communities, mainly village facilitators and the

                                            15
implementation committee members; (ii) local government level, at the village, sub-
district, district and provincial levels; and (iii) private sector consultants who were
engaged mainly as technical facilitators. At the end of KDP-3 implementation, at least
5,000 rural facilitators had been trained, about half of whom were engineers. They are
available for this or other CDD-type programs or alternatively they may use the skills and
experience they have acquired through KDP-3 and earlier KDP projects to work in other
sectors, such as with government, with NGOs, or in the private sector.

When people from local communities take on roles as village facilitators (FD), village
planning and implementation committee (TPK) members, village monitoring team
members, or as elected UPK officers, their capacities were developed through a learning-
by-doing process. The training they received from the facilitators would have been
meaningless if these villagers had not had hands-on experience in village planning,
carrying out field surveys, facilitating village meetings, managing their own projects,
discussing implementation problems, and other related processes.

The institutionalization of participatory processes in local government has not made
much progress because the adoption of local regulations/bylaws (Perda) to (i) strengthen
the non-elected village councils and (ii) to underpin the local development process,
especially for CDD-type projects, has not happened as planned. Although part of the
original outcome indicators, monitoring of these actions has been abandoned.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
The decision by the Indonesian government in 2006 to rebrand KDP as PNPM and to
transform it into a major, country-wide program using the same principles and
arrangements was an important, unintended outcome. In fact, IEG had rated the
likelihood of project sustainability as “low? just a few months before the Indonesian
president's announcement of the national scale-up. The impact of this decision has been
lasting: in 2010, PNPM III was approved and Indonesia’s parliament has recently
confirmed sustained national coverage by PNPM until 2014.

At the provincial level, a KDP-type approach was adopted by three autonomous
provinces (Aceh, Papua and West Papua). These provinces allocated significant budget
resources (US$100 million over 18 months in the case of Aceh) to such projects which
they linked directly to KDP/PNPM, utilizing the same facilitators and planning processes.
In addition, many local governments instituted locally-funded, community-based
development efforts based directly on KDP principles and processes. There is also
increasing use of the KDP approach for meeting specific, non-infrastructure, community
goals, including educational and health goals (KDP Generasi for achieving MDGs) and
agricultural goals. In addition, KDP/PNPM has become a vehicle to address other
community needs, such as post-disaster and post-conflict reintegration (mainly in Aceh),
and tapping renewable energy sources and improving environmental management
(“Green KDP?).

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
A multi-stakeholder workshop was held in October 2010 in Jakarta to elicit feedback
related to the project. More than 30 individuals attended, representing a wide range of
project actors, including the national audit agency; management consultants; sub-district
FM units (UPK); facilitators; village implementation team members; women’s micro
finance group members; and a number of Indonesian NGOs. The workshop was very
productive: in addition to lively discussions on project issues, outcomes and impacts, a
number of important conclusions and recommendations were generated. The points most
frequently raised were: (i) the inherent difficulty of specifically targeting the poor; (ii)
overloading and insufficient training of facilitators led to some quality problems during
implementation; (iii) high transparency helped to minimize corruption; (iv) MIS should
have been improved; and (v) KDP was superior to PNPM.

The perceived superiority of KDP may seem odd, but it is mainly related to the
preference of central government project actors to manage a project with a centralized
structure. By contrast, provincial and district officials are satisfied with the decentralized
project structure (For more details see Annex 6).

A separate meeting was held with key staff from PMD, the executing agency, and NMC,
their consultants. The key point raised by PMD was that KDP was relatively simple but
the rapid scale-up caused some quality problems. A suggestion from the PMD staff for
the preparation of PNPM IV was for facilitators to train and develop “technical cadres? at
the village level to increase sustainability through better O&M. The NMC team leader
suggested that PNPM Rural should “work smarter? in the now decentralized environment
and attempt to retain some of KDP’s good features, i.e. clarity of management,
supervision and reporting line of consultants/ facilitators

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate
The risk to the development outcome is rated moderate. Despite some shortcomings of
this project, the KDP/PNPM program is well established and has been continued through
PNPM Rural, which is already being implemented. The project has facilitated an ongoing
learning process, with lessons being captured and, more or less promptly, incorporated
into the next cycle of PNPM. However, the slow progress in institutionalizing
participatory processes throughout the operations of local government and the continuing
constraints to good O&M performance by village committees pose a moderate risk to the
development outcome. Overall, the lower risk factors (the high economic impacts of
community projects, the vigorous community engagement and ownership, the
government commitment, good governance, and institutional support) considerably
outweigh the higher risk factors (the technical quality and the limited technical and
financial capacity for good O&M). Therefore, the risk to development outcome has been
rated as moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank performance is rated as satisfactory because the majority of the criteria for
ensuring quality at entry have been met as follows:

   The project was highly relevant to the Indonesian government, as demonstrated by
    its subsequent adoption as a national program for community empowerment and
    poverty alleviation;
   Technical, financial and economic aspects were appropriate because they were
    based on the experience of earlier KDP projects, modified and improved as needed;
   Poverty, gender and social development aspects were at the core of KDP-3 since
    poverty alleviation and improved local governance were the overall development
    objective of this project and because participation is a key principle of KDP;
   Environmental aspects were properly addressed during preparation and appraisal,
    Although KDP projects have minor environmental impacts;
   Fiduciary aspects were fully dealt with through strengthened financial management
    capacity and through a comprehensive anti-corruption plan;
   Implementation arrangements were workable as they were an improved version of
    the tested and proven arrangements of earlier KDP projects;
   M&E arrangements mainly focused on improving those of the earlier KDP projects.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The quality of Bank supervision is rated as Moderately Satisfactory based on a review
of the key supervision quality criteria as follows:

   There was a consistent and strong focus on the development impacts of poverty
    alleviation and improving local-level governance;
   Fiduciary aspects, in particular financial management, local procurement and anti-
    corruption measures were given much attention during supervision. The latter were
    supported by an effective complaints mechanism;
   Supervision inputs and processes were more than adequate, albeit not as much
    through conventional semi-annual missions but rather an ongoing supervision effort
    by a dedicated KDP/PNPM office and staff based in Indonesia;
   The quality and candor of performance reporting was adequate although there were
    few formal supervision reports;
   Fully adequate transition arrangements were assured by the nature of the rolling,
    overlapping KDP/PNPM program, and also by training of communities in O&M
    and assistance with setting up community organizations for O&M;
   Documentation was often late, which reduced its utility to management;
   Follow-up often took a strategy of intense engagement with the executing agency
    almost to the point of micro-management rather than escalation to higher level
                                         18
    Indonesian authorities for resolution. However, that approach also had allowed
    smooth annual processing of additional loan in parallel with continued
    implementation.
   While CDD made up a big share of overall Bank lending to Indonesia over this time
    period, projects were supervised as individual investments rather than as a portfolio.
    As a result, messages to government were not always consistent or reflective of
    overall trends.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Based on the above ratings for quality at entry and for supervision, the overall Bank
performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Government performance is rated as Satisfactory because:

   Ownership and commitment to achieving the development objectives was very high
    since KDP was adopted by government (as PNPM) As their main vehicle for
    nation-wide community empowerment and poverty alleviation;
   Institutional policies were adequate but there were initially delays with the
    decentralization law, and the institutionalization of participatory processes at the
    local level did not progress as well as anticipated;
   Implementation arrangements were good as government had decided to use an
    improved version adapted from earlier KDP operations. However, there were delays
    with staff appointments. Although apparently ready for implementation, KDP-3A
    was delayed by a year because of uncertainty caused by a proposed decentralization
    law;
   Concerning fiduciary aspects, adequate counterpart funding was provided,
    covenants were fully complied with, and government audits (that also reviewed
    procurement) were performed;
   M&E was adequate but the MIS was initially overwhelmed by the major scaling up
    of the project;
   Relationships and coordination with donors was good, as evidenced by the number
    of eleven linked trust funds (totaling US$24.5 million) from four bilateral donors;
   Fully adequate transition arrangements were assured by the nature of the rolling,
    overlapping KDP/PNPM program, and also by training of communities in O&M
    and assistance with setting up community organizations for O&M;
   Weaknesses in the government’s performance include:
    - Lack of clarity over who is responsible for project oversight;
    - Delays in budget releases; and
    - Over-reliance on Bank supervision.



                                           19
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The performance of the implementing agency (PMD) is rated Moderately Satisfactory
because while all criteria were met, some weaknesses were identified, as follows:

   PMD and the regional offices were fully committed to achieve the development
      objectives;
   The consultations with, and participation of, the benefiting communities was very
      good since this is an integral part of the project preparation and implementation
      process of KDP projects;
     There were some problems and delays with the appointment of staff at all levels;
     There were delays in resolving implementation issues, such as improving the MIS;
     The M&E system did not always provide timely and complete information although
      the data were available at the local levels;
     Coordination with donors was very good, and adequate transition arrangements
      were in place (same as above for government);
     Inadequate budget planning, which led to a very high level of time-consuming
      budget revisions that adversely affected field implementation;
     Slow or inadequate action on poor staff performance and corruption complaints;
     Poor quality training programs, particularly for the social facilitators;
     Inconclusive performance reviews in joint WB-GoI discussions, with vow level
      participation from the executing agency itself.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Based on the above ratings, the rating for overall borrower performance is Moderately
Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

Adoption by government: A popular and politically robust series of projects with
demonstrated success in rural poverty reduction and improved governance has not only
survived major political change but has also led to its adoption by government as a
massive national program.

Increases in local government contributions: A project that has been shown to be
responsive to local needs can lead to a substantial increase in local government
contributions from their own budgetary sources. The KDP’s early success helped to
convince the central and the district governments to very significantly increase their
counterpart contributions for KDP-3, with contributions in excess of 25 percent from
local governments. The increase of local cost sharing was helped by the implementation
of the Indonesian government regulation on mandatory contributions by local
governments.

Success attracts bilateral donors: A successful series of projects can attract bilateral
donors through linked trust funds. Australia, Canada, Japan, and the UK supported the

                                          20
project’s achievement of its PDO with eleven separate trust funds totaling US$24.5
million (equivalent) in grant funding.

Bank’s responsiveness in the face of legal and political uncertainty: The Bank’s
responsiveness and flexibility can be crucial to “save a project? during a period of legal
and political uncertainty (in this case, over the passage by the national parliament of the
decentralization law). The KDP-3A loan/credit was modified (after Board approval) to
allow the implementation of a scaled back first phase, followed by a much larger second
phase, including very substantial additional financing, after the eventual approval of the
comprehensive decentralization law.

Advantages of project’s flexibility: A project’s flexibility can be a major advantage if
damages from large natural disasters require a quick response to fund emergency
reconstruction. This project readily addressed the huge needs through a re-allocation and
an additional development objective. Existing implementation arrangements and staff
were used to channel the reconstruction funds. The Bank’s flexibility also helped to
attract bilateral and multilateral donors to participate in the emergency reconstruction
efforts.

Participation and transparency to safeguard against financial mismanagement: the
project demonstrates that participation and transparency definitely help to safeguard
against financial mis-management. The project was implemented without major financial
management problems, with all project audits being clean and only minor issues being
raised. This was due mainly to the highly participatory and transparent approach,
including ample independent public oversight by the media and NGOs.

Rapid and large scaling up of a programmatic operation can exceed institutional
capacity: In KDP-3, the major expansion of the scope and scale of the project led to
problems with data collection and the capacity of the MIS system. Such challenges
should be anticipated and addressed in project design.

Effective complaints mechanism to prevent corruption and abuse of power: An
effective complaints mechanism can help not only to prevent corruption and abuse of
power, but also to ensure that social safeguard problems (related to land and assets), if
any, can be reported and dealt with.

Necessity for increased attention to training and socialization: In a project that had
focused on economic infrastructure, increased attention to training and socialization of
communities can bring about a very substantial increase in investments in education and
health infrastructure – sectors that had been neglected in earlier phases of the KDP
program.

In-depth evaluation studies to improve project design and implementation: It is
invaluable to learn from in-depth evaluation studies carried out as part of the project to be
able to improve project design and implementation. For example, KDP carried out a
randomized experimental intervention to assess whether popular participation or

                                             21
increased sanctions would be more effective in reducing corruption. The findings were
that for public goods, formal audits using a specially adapted audit manual could reduce
corruption rates significantly. Results from this study have been adopted across the
national program. Also, a qualitative impact evaluation study completed in 2007 – when
the bulk of the KDP-3 investments were completed – found that KDP had significant
impacts on local-level governance practices and community empowerment which was a
key development objective of KDP-3. Specific lessons from this study are:

   Village     heads are the strongest factor influencing the quality of KDP
      implementation. Support for, and engagement with, village heads, especially for
      greater transparency and accountability, is of prime importance for the success of
      the KDP projects and for village development and governance;
     If mechanisms for monitoring and accountability are still weak or unknown,
      villagers will rather attend planning meetings than accountability meetings;
     KDP’s ability to involve women fully in the development process is still limited,
      although there is a high regional variation in women’s involvement;
     When comparing KDP projects to other village-implemented projects, the KDP
      projects are consistently more likely to (i) meet village priority needs; (ii) ensure
      transparency and accountability; and (iii) achieve better quality at lower cost.
     Lastly, KDP was shown to better support existing or nascent practices of good
      governance through helping reformist village heads and training KDP actors,
      although it has limited ability to dramatically change village governance in the short
      term.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
The findings of the Borrower/Implementing Agency completion report are in line with
those of the Bank’s ICR, and require no comment or response from the Bank. The
borrower also reviewed and commented on the Bank’s final draft ICR. These comments
helped improve the final ICR, but did not express differing views that require response by
the Bank.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Block Grants

Objective: Villagers participate in a process to plan, select and manage basic social and
economic infrastructure provided through block grants.

The physical outputs of Component 1 are shown in the summary table below under
Infrastructure9 . The table shows that road projects continue to be the highest priority
choices of villages, but the proportion of projects involving water supply and irrigation
systems has been increasing over the years.

Although part of the KDP-3 activities, the infrastructure outputs for emergency
reconstruction are shown in a separate “post-disaster? column to give an indication of the
portion of such activities in Aceh, Nias, Yogyakarta, and other smaller devastated areas.
Also, KDP-3-AF had added a focus on health and education investments under
Component 1. Infrastructure outputs for these sectors are shown further below in the
summary table under the respective headings.

The number of people employed and number of days worked were 2,398,400 and
16,175,525 respectively. The average number of days worked per person was
approximately six, because the aim was to employ as many villagers as possible to give
everybody who wanted an opportunity to work and to earn additional income.

Other indicators for Component 1 that were measured and where targets were achieved
are shown in the “Results Indicators? table below: the number of women participating in
village meetings ranged from 28 to 44 percent (target was 40 percent)10; the percentage of
grants disbursed reached 100 percent; and the infrastructure rated as high quality was 65
percent (target was 70 percent). There was no actual recording of the “percentage of
devastated areas (in Aceh and Nias) benefiting from KDP technical and economic
assistance.? However, with a target of 80 percent, indications are that 100 percent of
villages in devastated areas received KDP assistance as a matter of priority (they did not
necessarily receive assistance only through KDP-3, because there were other, specifically
targeted projects for community reconstruction, with bilateral and multilateral grant
funding, such as the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDF).

 Since government records are by implementation/budget year, the numbers in the above table may include
outputs from other KDP/PNPM projects that were implemented concurrently with KDP-3.
10
  Although the participation rate was to be measured for “women and poorest community members in
planning and decision-making meetings?, only the percentage of “women participating in village meetings?
was actually measured.

Component 2: Developing Community and Local Government

Objective: Local governments use their new skills to fulfill their local governance
functions.

Although there was little progress with villages formulating implementation regulations
(Perda), the district governments greatly increased the level of their contributions to the
program. Depending on fiscal capacity, the local government contributions ranged from
20 percent (low capacity), to 40 percent (medium) and all the way to 70 percent (high
fiscal capacity). In total, local budget sources contributed US$65 million.


                                            25
Component 3: Support to Micro-finance institutions (UPKs)

Objective: Sub-district micro-finance institutions (UPKs) have the skills to carry out their
credit activities successfully and sustainably.

The outputs that were measured for this component were as follows (also see tables):

           Number of active women’s loan groups (SPP)                25,372
           Number of beneficiaries                                   634,621
           Percentage of UPKs that received training                 100% (target was 75%)
           SPP repayment rates between 2005 and 2008                 92% to 94%

A risk analysis of UPKs performed at the end of 2006 (halfway through project
implementation) showed that 76 percent of all 1,564 active UPKs were rated “sustainable?
based on their financial reserves, repayment rates, income potential and their general
management.

Component 4: Monitoring and Evaluation.

Objective: Project stakeholders use results of M&E activities and studies to improve
project performance.

KDP-3 started out using M&E results from KDP-1 and KDP-2 to improve its design. The
Indonesian government’s decision to launch a nation-wide KDP-type program, PNPM,
was at least in part based on the implementation data of KDP-2 and the ongoing data
coming in from KDP-3’s MIS. Although not all proposed studies were actually
conducted 11 , there was a qualitative impact evaluation in 2007 and an assessment of
village infrastructure and social conditions, also in 2007. A study on village capacity in
maintaining infrastructure was completed late, in 2010. The baseline and the subsequent
impact evaluation of the KDP-3 and the early phases of PNPM were completed in 2007
and 2010 respectively. For all studies, the findings are used to improve project design and
implementation of new and ongoing KDP operations.




11
     The proposed studies on matching grants and on options for sustainable financing were not done.

Objective: Local governments and communities use planning and facilitation skills.

Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

No specific economic analysis was conducted at project appraisal or after completion, but
in 2005 an independent team evaluated KDP infrastructure projects by sampling three of
the most common types of infrastructure works in four provinces: East Java, North
Sumatra, South Sulawesi and East Nusa Tenggara. The results indicated by the following
table:

 Infrastructure      Cost-Saving Construction         Quality Rated      Average Value
      Type          Compared to Equivalent Work       “Fair to Very        of EIRR
                       Built by Government               Good?
                          (by contractors)
 Roads and                     36%                        100%                52%
 Bridges
 Clean Water                    39%                        93%                39%
 Supply
 Irrigation                     27%                        78%                68%


 Average                        34%                        90%                53%

The EIRR values are well in excess of the 30 percent lower threshold set for this project.
No significant changes have occurred since the 2005 evaluation in the way the KDP-3
has selected, prioritized, planned and implemented infrastructure subprojects. Therefore,
the results of the 2005 study are considered to remain valid. However, the EIRR values
may be lower than the 53 percent average shown above because the first cycles (KDP-1
and KDP-2) would have funded the subprojects meeting the highest needs and therefore
yielding the highest returns.

Annex 5: Beneficiary Survey Results

The 2008 Impact Evaluation of the Second Phase of the KDP in Indonesia concluded that
locally conceived and executed infrastructure projects consistently have produced high
levels of community satisfaction and little negative environmental impact.

Although not specifically prepared for this particular project, a 2005 survey and
evaluation of KDP infrastructure projects across Indonesia found that:

      97 percent of infrastructure projects benefited the community as or more than
       expected;
      92 percent of these projects are still fully functioning;
      96 percent of villagers responding were satisfied with infrastructure quality that
       has been built;
      94 percent of infrastructure projects had no negative impact on the environment;
       and
      6 percent had a light environmental impact.

Similarly, villagers have stated a high level of satisfaction with the KDP program as a
whole:

      97 percent are receptive to other projects with the same regulation as KDP; and
      95 percent feel KDP is running smoothly without any serious problems.




                                           32
Annex 6: Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

1. A multi-stakeholder workshop was held on October 20, 2010 in Jakarta to receive
   feedback on the project. Over 30 persons attended, representing a wide range of
   project actors:
        National Audit Agency;
        National Management Consultants (former staff);
        Regional (Provincial) Management Consultants;
        Sub-district Financial Management Units (UPK) & their supervision agency;
        Inter-village Cooperation Board;
        District-level monitors;
        Sub-district-level PMD project manager;
        District and sub-district-level facilitators (technical & financial);
        Village implementation teams;
        Women’s savings and loan groups;
        Not-for-profit, NGO research & monitoring organizations.

2. The workshop was very productive, and in addition to lively discussions of project
   issues, outcomes and impacts, a number of important conclusions and
   recommendations were generated, as summarized below:

        Objectives of (i) empowerment; (ii) economic development; and(iii) poverty
         reduction were the right ones;
        The optimal balance between these three objectives is less certain, with some
         participants suggesting that the 25 percent ceiling for revolving loans was too
         low, while others thought it should be set at 10 percent. Moreover, it was
         suggested that many recipients of the revolving micro loan funds are not really
         poor;
        Targeting of the poor was found to be very difficult;
        Another viewpoint was that the sub-district block grants were not adequate
         areas with a large number of villages as poor;
        Many discussants (including some facilitators present) agreed that facilitators
         were overloaded with work, did not have enough training before and during
         project implementation, and therefore there were weaknesses that affected the
         quality of project implementation, such as some road subprojects. Facilitators
         should be better supported and better supervised to achieve higher quality
         results;
        However, quite a few participants thought that KDP-3 was still better than the
         current PNPM, which they perceive to be much too decentralized, burdening
         the facilitators with even more villages and providing them less training;
        It was thought that more TA support is needed for communities to ensure they
         can achieve sustainability.Additional TA was specifically suggested for quality
         enhancement, better O&M, and financial management of revolving funds;
        A better MIS for good M&E would have helped;


                                          33
        On a positive note, KDP-3 was lauded for high transparency that helped to
         minimize corruption (misuse of funds), and the strong focus on poverty
         alleviation;
        Many participants thought that the program should continue until communities
         become self-sustaining.

3. A representative of the executing agency (MOHA - PMD) and one from the NMC
   were interviewed separately from the stakeholder workshop. They were more
   concerned with strategic and policy aspects of the KDP/PNPM.

Main points from PMD:

      KDP-3 was implemented well because it had a straight forward, centralized
       management structure for decision-making and problem solving;
      As the program was scaled up from KDP-3A to 3B + AF, many additional
       facilitators had to be hired which resulted in lower standards for employment and
       affected the quality of implementation;
      PMD needs continued support from the Bank for PNPM now, especially for
       difficult areas that need special attention, such as Papua and West Papua;
      Lessons for the proposed PNPM IV: Knowledge for the sound implementation of
       O&M should be transferred by the facilitators to the communities. A “technical
       cadre? is needed in each community to help make investments sustainable.

Main points from the team leader of the NMC:

      KDP-3 had a simple structure, and all consultants (facilitators) were employed by
       the central government, under NMC’s direction. There were clear mechanisms
       and rules for the effective management of the facilitators;
      Coordination worked well in this unified project, and everybody was happy
       except the district and provincial governments, who were unhappy at being by-
       passed;
      The quality of the facilitators was generally good, and they received more training.
       They also had higher commitment toward the project and the communities that
       they served;
      Lesson for the proposed PNPM IV: The challenge will be to (i) work smarter
       within the decentralized environment, and (ii) try to use the good elements and
       features of the KDP era, adapted as needed.

Note: Many project actors who spoke could not resist comparing KDP-3 (“the good old
days?) with the PNPM III that is currently being implemented. Most were positive that
the old KDP model had worked very well. The lessons above reflect this sentiment.

Annex 7: Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

A. Borrower comments on draft ICR

The borrower reviewed the Bank’s final draft ICR and provided comments, but they are
not reproduced here because they were given in the form of embedded comments within
the ICR itself. The comments were largely technical and collaborative in nature, and did
not involve significant differences with the Bank’s findings or assessments. They led to
some final corrections and revisions of the ICR itself, and did not raise issues or
competing viewpoints that required the borrower’s comments to be extracted and detailed
separately in the ICR.

B. Borrower completion report

In November 2010, the executing agency PMD provided the Bank with the Borrower’s
ICR in final draft form, as prepared by the NMC. It is a comprehensive report on the
implementation of KDP-3. Much of the data and findings in this ICR have been gleaned
from this PMD report. Below is a somewhat shortened version (prepared by the primary
author of the Bank ICR) of the Borrower’s Executive Summary12:

Message from the Director General of Community and Village Empowerment (PMD):

Phase 3 of KDP was the last phase of the most successful rural community empowerment
program ever implemented in this country. The end of Phase 3 marked nine years of the
poorest rural communities in Indonesia actively participating in the development of their
own villages through KDP’s very effective bottom-up participatory development method.
The success of the KDP approach has been recognized by the Indonesian Government
and is continuing on a much larger scale as its primary poverty alleviation program for
rural areas. The new follow-on program is called The National Rural Community
Empowerment Program (Program Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat Mandiri
Perdesaan) or PNPM Rural.

KDP-3 provided over Rp 2.52 trillion or US$267.4113 million in development assistance,
both from loans and the central government’s budget for 18,425 infrastructure and
socioeconomic activities in 18,007 villages and 1,144 sub-districts across Indonesia.
Additional effort was focused on strengthening local institutions at the sub-district and
village levels during KDP-3 to reinforce the groundwork for sustainability of the KDP
participatory approach.




12
  Due to the length (14 pages) of the executive summary of PMD’s final report, this shortened version has
been prepared by the primary author of the Bank ICR. The entire borrower’s ICR comprises 128 pages,
plus a 50-page annex.
13
     The amounts given by GOI differ significantly from the Bank’s records of funds disbursement for KDP-3.

                                                     35
A special pilot program called P2SPP was also implemented during KDP-3 with the
specific objective of integrating the KDP approach within the regular local government
development planning mechanism. Thus far, KDP has operated outside of, but parallel
to, this system. Long-term sustainability and acceptance of the KDP approach at the local
government level depends on integrating the two systems to ensure that community
proposals developed through genuine bottom-up planning can be accepted by local
officials and be included in the final district level government programs.

The Program also supported and closely monitored the progress of three other pilot
program initatives. These programs piloted new methods and techniques for providing
more intensive and focused assistance in education and community health at the village
level. They also provided intensive capacity building support to village monitoring teams
so that they could play a more proactive role in monitoring project construction quality
and financial management.

Local governments continued to provide strong support during KDP-3 by committing
approximately US$65 million from their own budgets to direct community block grants
under the Program’s cost sharing mechanism. This support demonstrates a strengthening
of regional autonomy and increased local government commitment to the KDP approach.

Foreword from the Director of Community Institutions and Training:

The end of KDP-3 marked the end of nine years of successful implementation of KDP’s
bottom-up, participatory approach to rural development. High levels of community
participation continued throughout KDP-3. The majority of the workers (more than 70
percent) employed in the labor-intensive infrastructure investments were from the poorest
segments of the community, as identified by household surveys conducted by local
residents and KDP facilitators.

The expansion of the Program into its next stage as rural PNPM is an indication of the
central government’s confidence in KDP’s proven record to function as a cost-effective
vehicle for poverty alleviation. This confidence is the result of the program’s support for
participatory development; the principles underlying regional autonomy and
decentralization; its pro-poor and pro-women approach; local democratic decision
making; transparency and accountability; and prioritizing real community needs to ensure
program sustainability. We look forward to further support from our donors and our
central and local government partners as the Program expands and moves into the next
stage of its development as the new rural PNPMprogram.

Introduction:

KDP-3 was split into two loans, KDP-3A and KDP-3B. The program was implemented
via three programs annual cycles: 7, 8 and 9. Management of the program during the
three years of KDP-3 was considerably more complex than in previous phases due to the
special assistance to post-disaster reconstruction needs and three new pilot programs.



                                            36
The GoI chose to channel large amounts of emergency assistance for post-disaster areas
through KDP-3 because of the program's long established, nation-wide networks at the
sub-district and village levels and its highly efficient mechanisms for channeling funds
directly to village communities. KDP’s system was ideal for responding rapidly to post-
disaster areas like Aceh, Nias, Yogyakarta and Klaten (Central Java). All these areas all
suffered extensive damage from earthquakes and/or tsunami. The program created new
streamlined operational procedures to speed up the delivery of assistance to post-disaster
areas. While KDP-3 provided quick initial support, some of these post-disaster locations
mentioned above were funded from special donor grants (MDF for Aceh and Nias).

Three new pilot programs were launched during KDP-3 by funding field trials of more
focused approaches to other aspects of the Program that had not received the attention
needed during earlier stages of KDP; this was mainly due to limited resources and the
heavy workload of facilitators in the main Program. The three pilot programs were:

   1. Education Pilot, covering early childhood education;
   2. Health and Community Sanitation Pilot;
   3. P2SPP Pilot which attempted to integrate the regular local government
      development planning mechanism with the KDP approach.

The new pilot programs were conducted on a small to medium scale, provided with
special technical guidelines and operational procedures, and used specially trained
facilitators.

Main Differences between KDP-3 and earlier KDP Programs:

The decision to extend KDP for another phase was based, among other factors, on a
realization that tangible benefits had accrued to communities that participated in the
program. The program had succeeded in improving the livelihood of communities
wherever it had been implemented. There was also a desire to ensure the sustainability of
the CDD concept post-KDP at the local level.

KDP-3 was implemented in sites that had finished three previous activity cycles, either
during KDP-1 or KDP-2. The main difference between previous versions of KDP, and
KDP-3 was the desire of the central government to use KDP-3 as an exit strategy for the ten
year program by making participating locations more self-sufficient post KDP. Through
KDP-3, the government hoped to handover the main responsibility for management of the
program to local communities and their local governments. It was hoped that existing local
investments would be maintained, and hopefully developed further, through improved
cooperation between ex-KDP communities and their local governments.

KDP-3 officially started in the third quarter of 2005. Implementation was preceded by a
socialization program to brief district officials and technical teams through a series of
national seminars that were run at the end of 2004. The next step was site selection and
negotiation of funding contributions (cost sharing) from all the participating local
governments (Pemda). The cost sharing details were decided at hearings with each local

                                            37
legislature (DPRD). The final step was the signing of the Grant Agreements or Naskah
Perjanjian Hibah (NPH) between the central government and the local governments.
Cost sharing was negotiated based on each kabupaten government’s fiscal capacity.

KDP-3 sought a strong commitment both from local governments (Pemda) and their
legislatures to ensure that KDP’s principals and procedures were institutionalized as part
of a sustainable rural development system. Ideally that commitment was to take the form
of:

1. The willingness of local governments to allocate funds for block grants (BLM)
   according to local fiscal capacity as outlined in the guidance issued by the Ministry of
   Finance (see arrangements described below);
2. Provision of administration funds and operational budgets (PAP) for each district
   coordination team. These funds were also to cover kecamatan/sub-districts.
3. Willingness of local governments to work with KDP to undertake reviews of local
   regulations and/or by-laws (Perda) covering village governance to ensure existing
   regulations were consistent with KDP principles and policies and supported the
   autonomous village concept.

Additional criteria for selecting KDP-3 locations included:

   Kecamatan which had finished three full activity cycles during KDP I or KDP II;
   Kecamatan which were not classified as problematic due to unresolved corruption
    cases.

The Program’s funding arrangements between central and local governments (Pemda)
changed in KDP-3. Pemda contributions (referred to as cost sharing) were required as a
precondition for receiving BLM funds and were calculated based on the following
guidelines.

Cost Sharing Guidelines between Central and Local Government

             Fiscal Capacity                    Cost Sharing (%)
                                  Central Government         Local Government
                 High                      30                       70
                Medium                     60                       40
                 Low                       80                       20

In most aspects, KDP-3 at the kecamatan level was quite similar to KDP-2. KDP-3 BLM
funds could also be invested in any activities proposed by the community, except for
those included on the Program’s negative list. One notable difference in policy however
was the approach to microfinance activities. Productive economic units, or Usaha
Ekonomi Produktif (UEP), comprising of male and female members, could only be
funded via existing revolving funds managed by UPKs that were originally sourced from
previous KDP phases. KDP-3 funds could only be used to fund women’s microfinance
groups (SPP). This change in policy was the result of generally low repayment rates and


                                            38
significant numbers of non-performing loans and embezzlement cases among UEP
groups during KDP-1 and KDP-2.

Consultants and Facilitators Employed:

A large team of consultants and facilitators manages and executes the program at the
different administrative levels, i.e. national, provincial, kabupaten and kecamatan (see
table below). The average turnover of consultants because of resignations, dismals and
normal demobilizations during KDP-3 was about 10 percent annually. All consultants
during KDP-3 were employed directly by the Program’s national secretariat through
direct contracts. All consultants and facilitators employed by the program are Indonesian
nationals with the exception of two full-time international advisors and some short-term
specialists contracted for specific tasks and special studies.

KDP-3’s overall budget: 19 percent was used for training, planning grants for
communities and operating costs, the remaining 63 percent of funds were channeled
directly to participating rural communities in the form of direct community block grants
(BLM). Below is a summary of the types of consultants and facilitators employed during
KDP-3.

Village-Level Activities and Subprojects:

The poverty alleviation benefits from KDP-3’s investments in village infrastructure and
facilities during the Program were significant. During KDP-3 more than 1.7 million
people received over 6.8 million paid work days in KDP labor-intensive infrastructure
projects. The majority of the workers (over 70 percent) were also from the poorest
segments of the community as identified by household surveys conducted by local
residents and KDP facilitators.

Post project benefits claimed by villages and verified by a number of special studies
included improved access to main service and population centers, markets, schools and
health facilities; reductions in traveling time and overall transport costs; increases in
small business and economic opportunities; improved water quality and better access to
reliable clean water supply; and improved sanitation.

KDP infrastructure has been proven to be more cost effective than similar infrastructure
built by local governments, while still maintaining high quality. Independent studies

                                            39
conducted during 2004 and 2005 confirmed that KDP infrastructure is on average 56
percent cheaper than comparable infrastructure built by local government contractors.
These savings are the result of lower costs for labor, materials, equipment (using labor-
intensive construction methods instead of heavy equipment) and technical assistance
from facilitators.

Microfinance Activities:

About twelve percent of KDP-3 community block grant funds (approximately US$17
million) were invested in microfinance activities to fund small-scale businesses such as
agriculture, animal husbandry, fishing, trading and home-based enterprises. More than
13,030 groups representing more than 248,470 villagers received loans. Economic
activities were a high priority for women and were the activities most frequently
proposed by the special women’s meetings. Women’s credit (savings and loan) groups
(SPP) consistently out-performed the mixed credit groups (UEP) throughout KDP-3. By
December 2006, the average repayment rate for SPP women’s groups across 30
provinces was about 94 percent; with 20 provinces scoring above 90 percent, and 9
provinces even managed to achieve average repayment rates of over 97 percent. By
contrast, the average repayment rate for all UEP mixed groups across 30 provinces, as of
December 2006, was only 85 percent; with only 8 provinces scoring above 90 percent.

Recipients of KDP-3 microfinance loans have reported modest increases in household
incomes due to the additional income provided by their new or upgraded small businesses.
Most loans were for capital investments to improve existing businesses through
purchasing new equipment and additional inventories or to start new enterprises.

Health and Education Activities:

As a result of intensive socialization and facilitation during KDP-2, there were significant
increases in education and health proposals from villages compared to KDP-1, especially
in 2005. This increased emphasis on health and education was maintained during KDP-3
and was also the impetus for the Education and Health and Sanitation Pilot Programs.
During KDP-3, 1,371 new schools were constructed. By comparison, at the end of KDP-
2, 926 new schools had been built.

Virtually all the funds spent on health activities during KDP-3 were invested in
infrastructure in the form of small clinics and village health posts. During KDP-3, 764
health clinics were built and 58 renovated. These structures were built after verification
that personnel such as doctors, nurses and health workers would be provided after the
facilities were completed.

Community Participation and Empowerment:

Community participation and empowerment are the foundation of the KDP approach to
community-based rural development. Participation levels during the two years of KDP-3
showed consistently high participation levels. Village (desa) and hamet (dusun) meetings

                                            40
to socialize and plan KDP activities were characterized by relatively high levels of
attendance. In accordance with the Program’s objectives, the majority of those
participating (63 percent) in the planning meetings were also among the poorest members
of each village. Participation of women in the eleven main meetings of the KDP cycle
ranged from 28 to 44 percent during KDP-3, not including the special women’s meeting
(MKP).

Another indication of strong community participation and ownership was the high levels
of voluntary contributions (swadaya) from villages in the form of labor, materials, food
and even cash. Despite the relative poverty of the participating villages, community
voluntary contributions in cash, materials and labor have been significant since the
beginning of KDP, averaging about 6 percent of total project costs during KDP-314.This
figure varies considerably between regions across Indonesia and is often far greater than
6 percent, especially if a village is fortunate enough to possess large quantities of
building materials such as stone, sand or wood.When available, these materials are
commonly donated by villages, resulting in considerable project savings.

Interestingly swadaya contributions were often quite high in the poorest regions of
Eastern Indonesia like East Nusa Tenggara and West Nusa Tenggara. Characteristically,
local cooperation in the form of voluntary community action (gotong royong) is generally
higher in the more traditional areas of Indonesia where community spirit and social
cohesiveness are still quite strong. When this community spirit was successfully invoked
through the KDP community-based process, impressive and often surprising levels of
participation (usually in the form of labor contributions, since labor was often all these
villages had to give) were donated to the project.

KDP-3 and Local Government:

KDP-3 saw a continuation of the increase in acceptance of KDP principles and
procedures by local government officials that became evident by the end of KDP-2. By
the end of KDP-3, the animosity that had existed between consultants and many local
officials during KDP-1 (mainly sub-district (kecamatan) and village heads) who resented
the fact that they were forbidden from directly interfering with KDP projects or asking
for operational funds from those projects, had all but disappeared. Once these officials
became aware of the benefits for local development inherent in the KDP approach, they
quickly began to support the program enthusiastically.

A heightened sense of political survival among district heads (Bupati) who had to face
their constituents in direct local elections also encouraged the enforcement of KDP’s
principles and procedures among kecamatan and village level officials. The rapid
adoption of other copycat programs completely funded and managed by local
governments, called PPK Mandiri, also showed that many Bupati and governors were



14
     Bank data show a swadaya contribution averaging at least four percent.

                                                      41
clearly aware of the vote winning potential of the KDP approach among their rural
constituents. At last count, PPK Mandiri programs were underway in 23 provinces across
the country.

Program consultants at all levels have also reported evidence of improved local
governance as more and more local government officials have bought into the
participatory community-based approach to rural development and the change in mindset
that goes with it. This incremental change in local government thinking has been due, in
no small part, to the spread of community empowerment practices and an increase in
general awareness among villagers about the benefits of transparency and participatory
planning practices. Many reports were received during KDP-2 and KDP-3 about villagers
demanding higher levels of accountability from local government officials in the
management of other (non-KDP) government funded projects. Villagers have also been
transferring KDP procedures and financial management skills to other local development
projects.

Further proof of the widespread acceptance of the KDP approach among local
governments during KDP-3 has been the acceptance of the cost sharing arrangements that
replaced the matching grant financing mechanism which was introduced during KDP-2.
The matching grant system was created to help extend the program by asking local
governments to contribute to BLM from their own budgets so central government funds
could be stretched to include more locations.

The cost sharing arrangement requires participating local governments to fund a portion
of the direct community block grants from their own budgets; while the cost of technical
assistance, like consultants and costs for community planning activities (DOK), are still
borne by the central government. The portion paid by local governments is determined by
their fiscal capacity. Those with “high? capacity pay 70 percent, those with “medium?
capacity pay 40 percent, and those with “low? capacity pay 20 percent of the total cost of
BLM. One of the key differences with the cost sharing arrangements is that local
government budget funds must be disbursed before central government funds can be used.

KDP in Post disaster Locations:

KDP responded rapidly to the tsunami that devastated much of Aceh in December 2004,
the large earthquake that leveled most of the buildings in the Nias islands in March 2005
and the earthquake that hit Yogyakarta and Bantul, in Central Java, in 2006. KDP quickly
put in place special arrangements to accelerate the delivery of assistance to these areas.
These included expansion of KDP sites to include all kecamatan in the affected areas;
increasing the amounts allocated for BLM in all kecamatan; expanding the scope of
activities that could be funded; simplifying the BLM disbursement process; providing
extra consultant support; modifying the standard operational technical guidelines; and
modifying guidance for cooperation with other parties (NGOs) involved in post disaster
relief work and development. Separate reports for post disaster locations will be prepared.

Preventing Corruption and Responding to Complaints:

KDP continues to operate in a high risk environment where instances of corruption,
embezzlement, negative intervention by officials, creative bookkeeping by kecamatan
activity management units (UPK) and village implementation teams (TPK) require
constant vigilance. However, given the actual losses that the Program has suffered
compared to the amount of funds disbursed to communities, KDP has been very
successful in preventing and combating corruption in all its forms.

The reason for this success has been a systematic approach to corruption mitigation
involving three main elements. Firstly, bookkeeping and administration procedures have
been made as simple as possible to facilitate monitoring by consultants and other
stakeholders. Secondly, transparency in all matters pertaining to project decision making
and funds management is a basic principle of the program and is insisted upon by
consultants at all levels. Thirdly, prompt action is always taken in response to complaints
of any type.

During KDP-2, full-time complaints handling specialists (SP2M) were added to the staff
of the provincial management offices. These specialists quickly reduced the caseload of
problems that had built up during KDP-1 and also provided a demonstrable deterrent
effect within the program, especially after a number of high profile cases where
successfully prosecuted through legal channels. Besides contact numbers for consultants
on project information boards, community members have also been able to send letters to
a well publicized PO Box at the National Management Consultant (NMC) office in
Jakarta. Throughout KDP-2, the complaints handling specialists in the field were also
supported by a seven-person internal audit team based at the NMC that continually
traveled to project locations conducting spot audits and conducting on-the-job-training
for consultants and community members in financial management.

At the start of KDP-3, the province-based complaints handling specialists were replaced
by a monitoring and evaluation specialist who was effectively responsible for three main
tasks (microfinance, financial supervision and complaints). Within the first year ofKDP-3,
it was evident that the report writing workload of the monitoring and evaluation
specialists had made handling complaints and resolving corruption cases rather low on
their list of priorities. As a result, the SP2M specialist position was reinstated within the
provincial management offices at the beginning of 2007, the first year after the end of
KDP-3.

In accordance with the World Bank loan and credit agreements, the program was audited
each year by the State Development Finance Inspection Agency (BPKP).This agency
conducts annual spot audits on a 10 percent sample of project locations across the country.
The findings of these audits remain active until BPKP is satisfied that KDP field
consultants and local government coordination teams (TK-PPK) have completely
resolved each problem mentioned in the audit report.




                                            43
In addition to the formal audit teams, KDP-3 contracted provincially based local NGOs to
conduct external monitoring of key program principles and procedures in selected areas
as part of a pilot program called Provincial Based Monitoring (PBM). However, after
disappointing results in the first year, the approach used by the NGOs in the second year
of KDP-3 (2006) was changed from an external monitoring approach to a more hands-on
and inclusive method where members of village communities were selected, trained and
mentored by the NGOs to become internal program monitors instead of the NGOs acting
as an external “KDP watch? group. The method used is known as community
participatory monitoring (CPM). Significant improvements in uncovering corruption and
breaches of project procedures were noted after the NGOs adopted the CPM approach.

Although KDP has expended significant energy and resources on preventing, uncovering
and combating corruption, it is important to keep the total corruption picture in
perspective. Total losses due to corruption in the KDP Program up to and including KDP-
3 (a period of over nine years) were US$1,983,488. However, when compared to the total
funding disbursed during that period from all sources; this represented a loss to
corruption of approximately 0.18 percent of total disbursements.

A significant number of the outstanding cases still on the books will be resolved in time.
On average, the NMC’s complaints handling unit facilitates the resolution of, or directly
resolves, more than 40 percent of new corruption cases each year. The remainder is
pursued until they are resolved. By any standards, this is an impressive corruption
management record for a program as large as KDP in a country where development
projects struggle with the problem of corruption on a daily basis.

                                            Radio
The Project consists of following activities:

(a) Provincial and District Radio Information and Monitoring Support: Facilitated the
two-way exchange of information between tsunami affected communities and aid coordination
teams in Banda Aceh and Nias, North Sumatra, covering international, national and NGO aid
programs, disseminated information on available relief and rehabilitation programs, and
provided a channel for local feedback on problems encountered during reconstruction;

(b) Promoting Community Radio: Developed a network of community radios based in Aceh's
sub-districts and villages to provide training in broadcast management and programming,
support for reconstruction of local tele-centers, and developed a local level communications
system using radio and sms via mobile phone;

(c) Provision of Radio Set Grants: Provided radio sets to existing community groups to be
distributed to tsunami-affected communities and placed in publicly accessible locations.

Outcomes: There were 46 community radios produced and broadcasted many well documented
news and information, Public Service Announcements (PSA), and talk-shows programs. These
radios are still operating to date. The network was called ARRNet (Aceh Nias Reconstruction
Radio Network) and focused on providing information about the process of reconstruction and
rehabilitation. People in affected areas were provided with 4600 radio sets (radio receivers),
considering that each community radio which would cover minimum 2.5 km square. When
many commercial radio stations were destroyed by tsunami, SeHa FM community radio in
Jantho (Aceh Besar) was the only source for people. It was used as a medium for dialog
between the affected communities, aid agencies, local government and other stakeholders
during the recovery phase. People also used the radioto communicate among themselves in
order to heal their trauma, entertain and educate community members in recovery and
reconstruction situation. A good example for this purpose was the frequent use of nazam
(traditional poems of Aceh) to strengthen affected people to recover from their sadness. Nazam
was also used to express people’sfeeling, for example their hope about peace situation in Aceh.
Samudera FM, a community radio operated by refugees from the tsunami-affected areas in
North Aceh, broadcasts religious programs to heal the trauma of Acehnese who had been
affected by conflict and tsunami. Since those radios were staffed by local volunteers, it was
easier to interact directlywith community members. For example, Radio SeHa was managed by
young people who wereliving in refugee camps. SeHA aired field reports from camps giving
information on situations, problems and opinions of affected people living there. Radio Suara
Meulaboh (West Aceh), conducted voxpopuli interviews with local inhabitants. Samudera FM
in North Aceh reported and discussed conditions and problems faced by people living in camps
and barracks (infoaceh.net). The reports built close relations between community and their

                                              48
radio since the radio helped them to voice their aspirations. This activity brought volunteers
from Jaringan Radio Komunitas Indonesia/JRKI (Community Radio
Network of Indonesia) who played an important role in initiating community radio in Aceh.

   (JSDF)                                  Children
This grant builds on the PEKKA network of female-headed households. The grant finances
life-skills training for the very poorest members of their communities, with a special focus on
basic literacy, vocational training, and youth. It is still taking place in 9 PEKKA provinces. The
grant supports hamlet meetings to promote enrollment of poor children by providing basic
scholarship package, funding for monthly meetings of teachers and parents, and funding for
parents training.

Outcomes: 10,183 students received scholarships, of whom 60 percent were elementary school
students, 25 percent junior high school students and 15 percent students engaged in special
courses. The selection of beneficiary students was conducted by existing village Pekka groups.
An additional outcome was that the program became an incentive for other women from ‘poor,
male-headed households’ to join many Pekka trainings, and learn from and develop their own
groups. Another outcome was that many parents, especially women, joined parental care
training or became kindergarten teachers after they received some teaching skill trainings.

SADI aimed to combine the resources, skills and experience of three different development
agencies to address complex issues of rural poverty in the agricultural communities of four of
Indonesia’s poorest provinces. Working with three agencies, it was designed to address long-
standing issues and constraints related to agricultural production and rural poverty in Eastern
Indonesia.

Outcomes: More than 300 farmers’ groups formed, and trained and actively improved their
livelihood through an increase in household income. Meetings to identify problems and
priorities were held at all levels, and decisions were made by inter-village groups. In light of
the mixed results of SADI, the decision was made to discontinue this pilot project.

Also called “Green KDP/PNPM? was an environmental pilot program to finance 3 annual
cycles of block grants for investments in “green? subprojects focused on national resource
management (NRM), environmental conservation, renewable energy, and environmentally
sound income generating activities. The training of facilitators specifically for this pilot
program was also funded.

Outcomes: Communities have selected over 700 “green? subprojects and they were
implemented, funded by this TF. The process also facilitated community engagement with
local governments to include environmental issues in their planning process. Communities

This is a pilot project funded by JSDF to test out new approaches to complement KDP
approach, to introduce a cultural perspective to community-driven development. The
underlying concept of this pilot is that culture, in its many and diverse manifestation, includes
and supports economic and social values that can empower communities and provides essential
support for sustainable community-driven development. The production of handicrafts and
cultural shows generate income and provide employment through tourism. The goal of the pilot
is to revitalize and empower communities through supporting creative activities and building
awareness and capacity of local facilitators in tapping into cultural resources to reach out to the
community. Through the existing local network of KDP/ PNPM actors, the pilot provided
grants to local communities to support creative and cultural activities, as well as to regional-
based artists, artisans, cultural-groups and NGOs.

Outcomes: Across three pilot provinces, every sub-district conducted some form of a cultural
festival with slight variations, showcasing local performing arts, cultural traditions, cuisine,
handicrafts and other local produce to support local artists, promote PNPM, and stimulate sales
of local products. It was a big hit everywhere. People from remote villages, were transported to
the sub-district to participate in the events. PNPM local actors were very inspired and
encouraged by the general public who turned up in hundreds and thousands a day, and received
positive responses from the participating cultural groups and the local government agencies.
Many people said that it was the first time they saw some of their own traditional art forms,
which they have only previously heard about from the older generations. There is a growing
interest in traditional art forms following these festivals, some dormant arts groups are revived
in the process and aspire to perform at the district, provincial or national levels. Local artists,
who are often poor, benefited from participating in the festivals.

Significant increase in participation: The sub-districts that have introduced Creative
Communities funded cultural activities at PNPM regular meetings all claimed that attendance
and participation has increased by two or three folds, from typically 50-80 people per village
meeting in the past to 200-300 people. Although this does not necessarily imply more varied
voices at village meetings, with a bigger turnout, more people would have witnessed the PNPM
process, and been informed of how the funds were used and by whom, thereby adding to the
transparency and accountability of PNPM.

Developing local capacities and ownership: Creative Communities works largely through
existing local community personnel, with the PL (or Local Facilitator; not the ones hired by the
project) taking a lead, supported by BKAD and UPK. In addition, three new people are
selected to form a “Creative Team? to provide technical support at the sub-district level and
one “cultural assistant? at each village.

One positive outcome of this arrangement is local community personnel such as the PL and
BKAD are improving their capacities in facilitating village meetings and organizing cultural
activities, otherwise often untapped in PNPM. The success of the cultural festivals, for
example, boosts the confidence of many local teams. In some areas, their government
counterparts were surprised that they were able to organize such large-scale events, and even
approached them for support in staging cultural activities. Some of the more far-sighted local
teams have taken initiatives to seek support from governmental departments and alternative

be discontinued.

                                  Papua and West Papua
When GoI and the Bank agreed with the Papua provincial governments to merge the local
RESPEK program with PNPM, a shortage of competent technical facilitators was a major
constraint for project implementation. This grant financed a special program to give local
senior high school graduates basic training in civil engineering, mechanics, micro hydro power
generation, construction/building analysis, budget planning and implementation and social
facilitation and empowerment training. The University of Cenderawasih in Jayapura designed
and delivered a six-month intensive training course, combining classroom teaching with the
practical application of new knowledge in the field on the most common small-scale
infrastructure projects in Papua and West Papua.

Outcomes: More than 100 mostly Papuan participants (30 percent were women) graduated and
were deployed as technical facilitators in their home districts. “Barefoot Engineers?, as they are
called, now make up almost half of the field engineers for PNPM-RESPEK, thereby supporting
KDP in very remote areas of Papua & West Papua.
