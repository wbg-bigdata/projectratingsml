3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

         Background

Armenia has been one of the strongest reformers of the Confederation of Independent States (CIS), which
has helped compensate for its landlocked position, general isolation and weak resource endowment. After a
post independence economic freefall during 1991-93, the Armenian economy turned the corner and
recorded an average growth rate of 5.5 percent from 1994 to 2002.            Structural reforms including,
privatization and establishing legal framework for private sector development, particularly in the energy
and banking sectors, were major factors in the growth along with strong efforts in macroeconomic
stabilization. A well-educated workforce with specialized technical skills has also contributed. The rapid
and sustained real output growth, accompanied by low inflation, has improved poverty indicators. The
share of population living in poverty declined from 55 percent in 1998/99 to 48 percent in 2001, and in the
same period, the share of population in extreme poverty declined from 27 percent to 20 percent.
Nevertheless, it is clear that the level of poverty remains high.

In early 2001, the Government of Armenia made essential adjustments to its economic strategy. The
Government reform program, supported by the IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and
the fourth World Bank Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC4), has shifted the focus to improving the
business environment, developing consultative mechanisms with the private sector, and building capacity
for export and investment promotion. The restructured SATAC2 supported the development of the private
sector strategy. The Government effort in these areas has been broadly successful. Recent enterprise
surveys show the average time and cost to complete the business registration was reduced from 27 days and
US$109 in 2000 to 21 days and US$92 in 2001, respectively. Other surveys, for instance, the 2002
Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS), conducted by the World Bank and
EBRD, also indicated improved perceptions of the Armenian private sector on governance, including a
significant drop in both the frequency of corruption and the average time spent by companies' management
on dealing with the public officials.

The Government also strengthened its consultation mechanisms with the private sector and established a
high level Business Council, with representation from the private and public sectors and members of
Parliament. This has encouraged an open and more transparent dialogue between the Government and the
private sector, strengthening public-private partnerships in Armenia and providing a positive signal to
domestic and foreign investors. The strong economic growth of nearly 11 percent during 2001-02 was for
the first time driven by a high rate of export expansion. Manufacturing exports grew by more than 50
percent in two years, with a positive impact on employment and household incomes.

SATAC2 was pivotal, as well as flexible, in supporting structural adjustment in Armenia as it supported
four separate operations in which there was not only a deepening of reforms, but a change in policy
emphasis. SATAC2 was launched along with SAC2, which closed at the end of 1997. SATAC2 went on
to support the reforms completed under SAC3. SATAC2 also supported SAC4 and the preparation of
SAC5, both of which represented a shift in reform focus toward private sector development, and was
modified to support this policy shift. SATAC2 overlapped with its predecessor SATAC1 (which was also
extended four times and supported three adjustment operations) by nearly three years.

         Objective

Recognizing the vital role of a broad Technical Assistance operation in a reform program, the main



                                                      - 2 -

objective of SATAC2 was to support the key policy areas of the SAC2 with hardware and studies and
other expertise to build capacity in customs and taxation, the judiciary, privatization, capital markets and in
social services. This objective was relevant, timely and appropriate to the priority capacity building needs
and the ongoing reform program. (See section 3.3 for more details).

3.2 Revised Objective:

The basic objective of facilitating implementation of critical reforms and strengthening key institutions did
not change, but the specific priorities changed somewhat. With its extensions, SATAC2 went on to
support three additional SACs (SAC3, SAC4 and SAC5). (See section 3.4 for more details).

3.3 Original Components:

The components of SATAC2 supported key areas of the SAC2, SAC3, SAC4 and SAC5 operations, and
were consistent with the goals of the World Bank Group's Assistance Strategies for FY1999-01 and
FY2002-04. Table 1 presents the components of SATAC2 (with original allocations), a summary of their
specific activities in relation to priority national issues and the outcomes. Table 1 also includes the Private
Sector Development Component that was added in 2000, three years after effectiveness.                   All these
components were appropriate as they reflected national priorities, in particular, the successful transition to
a market economy.

                 independence.

3.4 Revised Components:

There was some restructuring of SATAC2 in late 2000, with the cancellation of some subcomponents,
notably under Capital Market Development and Resource Mobilization (see below), and the extension of
SATAC2 to support SAC3 and particularly SAC4 and SAC5. To more effectively support SAC4,
SATAC2 added a component for Private Sector Development (PSD-see section 4.2) and emphasized the
following activities during its third and fourth (final) extensions:      (i) conversion of state joint-stock
enterprises to International Accounting Standards (IAS); (ii) finalization of the privatization of four
electricity distribution companies; (iii) pension reform: (iv) support for operation of an Economic Reform
Analytic Information Center; (v) support to restructure hospitals; and (vi) support to upgrade the treasury
system.

3.5 Quality at Entry:

ICR ­ Satisfactory. The SATAC2's objectives and design were fully consistent with the reform program,
and without SATAC2, it would have been far more difficult to implement the reforms. As Table 1 shows,
SATAC2 supported a wide range of measures aimed at many of the main constraints to equitable and
sustained growth. Project preparation was carried out with full involvement of Government and reflected
its needs and priorities.

The Memorandum of the President (MoP) for SATAC2 cited several risks which were the same as those
associated with SAC2. While policy reversal risk was small, the potential for social dissatisfaction with a
slow pace of income recovery was considered a factor that could threaten political stability. The MoP also
cited the resumption of hostilities in the Nagorno-Karabakh as a risk. The MoP's response was to


                                                      - 5 -

accelerate growth oriented reforms, while increasing attention to social protection and services. Although
this risk assessment was certainly well founded, it was rather weak because these risks were not so much
risks of the technical assistance (TA), but rather the SACs that it supported. The risk assessment would
have been stronger had it focused more on risks typical for a TA, such as turnover of trained staff, lack of
sustainable processes or operationalization of new processes. The main weakness, however, was the
underestimate of the timeframe for completing the activities. The Bank had estimated somewhat less than
two years (21 months for completion), when it, in fact, took over five years (64 months) to implement.
While it may not have been envisioned at the outset, SATAC2 clearly took on the role of a flexible source
of funds that financed priority needs to support the adjustment operations that could not find funding
elsewhere. It disbursed slowly as the GOA found grant resources to replace some of the SATAC2 funds.
It made sense to keep SATAC2 open in order to have a flexible resource to finance key measures that could
not be funded with grants.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:

The achievement of objectives is rated satisfactory. This rating is also consistent with PSR ratings (see
Table 3, section 10.), where progress in reaching the project development objectives was rated satisfactory
throughout the project life, despite some implementation problems (see also Annex Table 1A). SATAC2
improved SAC2, SAC3, SAC4 and SAC5's quality at entry and was key in financing activities that were
not originally planned, but which led to fulfillment of tranche conditions, such as the conversion of
companies' financial statements to internationally accepted standards (IAS) by funding a US$150,000
subcomponent for computer equipment, specialized accounting software and training (a SAC3 fourth
tranche condition). SATAC2 also financed the establishment of the legal and institutional framework
necessary to implement SAC3 supported reforms. Table 2 summarizes the dates and durations of each of
the four extensions of SATAC2.

With respect to the areas of the specific project development objectives (section 3.1), SATAC2 performed
satisfactorily in privatization (particularly in the energy sector) and social services (with significant
progress in health and education). Other areas, including capital markets and judicial capacity building,
made satisfactory progress, but were also supported through funding from other donors.

SATAC2 had significant impact in private sector development and in catalyzing other funds for an
important national census. SATAC2 built capacity in the energy sector, which was critical for improving
the Electricity Regulatory Commission's (ERC) regulatory function and as a preparation for privatizing the
Electricity Distribution Companies (EDCs).        The education sector benefited from SATAC2, which
supported the new financial and managerial autonomy of schools, whose main impact was improving the
use of scarce school funds. SATAC2 supported assessments in the hospital sector necessary for bringing
health service delivery in line with economic principles, particularly budget constraints, and for identifying
the appropriate basic benefits package for all Armenians. SATAC2 had a substantial impact on the
delivery of social protection through consolidation of benefits into a single-family benefit and vastly
improved targeting of that benefit.

SATAC2, as mentioned, also had an important impact in leveraging funds from other donors. Examples
include support for the Central Depository (begun under SATAC2 and completed with USAID assistance),



                                                    - 6 -

the WTO Notification Center (with EU TACIS funds), and the Armenian Development Agency (ADA)
support (from Financial Investment Advisory Service-FIAS assistance). The best example of leveraging
was the case of the national census in which a small amount of SATAC2 funds (roughly US$30,000) led to
an additional US$1.0-1.5 million in donor funding without which the first census in Armenia since
independence would have been impossible. The census has had a large impact not only in providing a more
accurate assessment of the size and characteristics of the population, but also in making adjustments in
planning and benefits in the health and education sectors and reducing overcapacity in those sectors.

The Memorandum of the President for SATAC2 contained an annex of "Key Performance Indicators," of
which a majority were conditions of SAC2. By implication, the success of SATAC2 was tied closely to the
success of SAC2.       SATAC2 was responsible for building capacity, and to a great extent for the
implementation of reforms. All of the reforms were carried out, so it can be said that SATAC2 supported
fully implemented adjustment operations. These indicators are presented in Annex 1.

4.2 Outputs by components:

Though SATAC2 outputs are assessed as satisfactory overall, there were some difficulties with the
Privatization and the Resource Mobilization components. In addition, many of the planned actions were
financed by cheaper funds from other sources. The rating of SATAC2 is not downgraded for this. On the
contrary, the design of SATAC2 is credited for identifying measures that were deemed worthwhile by other
donors. SATAC2 is also credited for its flexibility in using the freed funds to finance new activities not
planned at appraisal in order to support additional adjustment operations. While the basic objective of
facilitating implementation of critical reforms and strengthening key institutions did not change, the specific
priorities changed overtime, with flexibility, SATAC2 helped to support the new priorities.

Resource Mobilization (Unsatisfactory) was continued from the predecessor TAs (IBL and SATAC1).
SATAC2 intended to focus on strengthening the investigation and enforcement departments of the Customs
and the State Tax Service. At Customs, the assistance was dependent on the implementation results of the
UNCTAD "ASYCUDA" project. Due to the delay in the implementation of the ASYCUDA project, the
computerization of the border posts and establishment of direct communication links with the banking
payments system were not carried out. In addition, there were frequent management changes in Customs
that made it difficult to work out issues and move forward with the implementation of this subcomponent.
At the State Tax Inspectorate, there was diminished interest in SATAC2 funds because a large source of
grant funds became available from USAID. There were problems at Treasury in contracting a consultant
to produce an Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS). A first team was selected, but the
consultants did not proceed with the work over an irreconcilable disagreement with the Government in
negotiating their contract. A second tender was launched after some delay, which required an extension of
SATAC2, and, eventually, a consultant was hired. However, the product did not meet the Treasury's
requirements and was delivered late, which was attributed mainly to the poor project management capacity
of the contractor and to the poor communication between the Treasury and the contractor. IT equipment
was procured, but was not fully effective because of the inadequate IFMS.



                                                      - 7 -

In the Energy (Satisfactory) sector, SATAC2 supported a reorganization of the Ministry of Energy along
with a strengthening of the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC). The TA was helpful to the Ministry of
Energy by hiring consultants to assist in redefining its functions and restructuring, given the unbundling of
the electricity companies (separation of electricity generation, transmission and distribution). SATAC2
also supported the sale of the EDCs, but there were difficulties in contracting effective legal advisors. In
the first legal advisor contract, the Government paid 25 percent of the contract amount, but the
privatization tender failed. Ultimately, SATAC2 financed legal and privatization expertise to launch a new
tender, which led to successful privatization of the EDCs.

Public Information and Judicial Reforms (Satisfactory) was designed to help Armenia continue the
transition to a market economy. The public information campaign targeted decision-makers and the public
and was largely successful in communicating the rationale and benefits of the reform program. SATAC2
financed consultants to assist the new Information Analytical Center for Economic Reforms, which was
charged with promoting the reform program. The activities under the judicial reforms subcomponent were
extended under the Bank's Judicial Reform Project, which supported the design and establishment of new
court administration, budgeting and case management procedures and the execution of judgments.

The Privatization (Satisfactory) component originally supported a pilot program of Initial Public
Offerings (IPOs), including the preparation of prospectuses, advice on how to sell the company and
underwriting offerings. However, these activities were eventually funded with grants from USAID. The
privatization component supported (along with the Financial Sector component) the privatization of the
Armenian Savings Bank as well as the EDCs, both of which were implemented under SAC4.

Capital Markets Development (Marginally Satisfactory) was intended to finance a study to develop an
action plan to assess capital market institutions and address issues of regulatory authority, stock
exchanges, clearing and settlement and depository institutions, etc., as well as to finance setting up a
National Depository Institution (NDI). Most of these activities were included in a USAID funded program,
which offered grant financing. The NDI was set up and its impact would increase as capital market
develops. To reiterate, the rating is not penalized for the fact that another donor offered grant funding to
carry out the originally planned activities.

The Financial Sector (Satisfactory) component financed local consultants to provide training and advisory
services to the accounting departments of the commercial banks and joint-stock companies and help them to
move toward International Accounting Standards (IAS), which was accomplished for all banks and 200
joint stock companies. The component was implemented in close coordination with the USAID project
covering accounting reform and training. Prior to SAC3 Board presentation, the Prime Minister approved
a Decree for the preparation of the development strategy for the Armenian Savings Bank and to support a
second tranche condition of SAC3, SATAC2 financed a firm to assist the GoA with the privatization of the
Armenian Savings Bank in September 1999.

Social Protection (Highly Satisfactory) achieved substantial improvements in targeting of social benefits
and in developing a pension reform strategy. The removal of tariff subsidies such as those for electricity
made it important to develop an effective poverty benefit. This component helped the GOA develop a
single, means-targeted, poverty or, "family," benefit and develop a pension system based on a publicly
managed, compulsory minimum old-age benefit. The pension system originally envisioned a three-pillar
system including privately managed, compulsory, and earnings-related pensions. The three-pillar system
was not, however, pursued because it became clear that such a system was beyond Armenia's institutional



                                                     - 8 -

development and income level. SATAC2 financed consultancies to develop the pension strategy, and a new
pension law was developed and adopted under the SAC5-supported reform program. SATAC2 also
provided substantial funds for computers and software to support the pension system. SATAC2 supported
major improvements in the capacity to target the single-family benefit. Recent beneficiary assessments of
the program suggest that targeting efficiency is quite high, among the best in the CIS.

The Health (Satisfactory) sector TA was originally aimed at developing a health sector consolidation
strategy. With some resistance to retrenchment, the TA ended up developing more of an inventory of
hospital capacity. However, the TA also supported defining the fiscally sustainable national health benefits
package, contracting health services, shifting hospital funding away from capacity-based and toward
service delivery-based funding and initiating the hospital optimization plan. Development of a more
advanced hospital optimization strategy was funded separately by USAID. The Government took initial
steps to restructure the sector and reduce the excess capacity during 2001-02 under SAC4 and SAC5.

The Education (Highly Satisfactory) TA financed key interventions in the revamped school financing
strategy, which was extended to technical and higher education. The assistance helped schools succeed in
their new autonomy by training administrative staff in budget planning, financial reporting, accounting,
overall school management and initiating the school rationalization program which is being implemented
under SAC5. This training was a key success factor in the conversion to a new financing system for
general education. There were major delays in paying a contractor who developed the strategy in higher
and technical education.     The Government had posed questions regarding the recommendations and,
ultimately, partially cancelled the contract because of poor quality of one of the two reports that were
delivered. This delay was noted in three successive PSRs, so resolution of the matter was very slow.

A Private Sector Development (Satisfactory) component was added following an amendment to the
Credit Agreement in September 2000. Funds were made available to this new component through the
downsizing and cancellation of other activities. This component supported various elements of the reform
agenda under SAC4 and SAC5 as expressed in the 2001 CAS to pursue rapid development of the private
sector. Activities included implementation of a new system of managing publicly owned real estate,
financing of Local Area Networks (LANs) for both the Ministry of Trade and Economic Development
(MTED) and the Ministry of State Property Management (MSPM), and support for enterprise
restructuring and new business creation based on the model successfully implemented in Moldova (the
ARIA model). This new component also supported the WTO Notification Center, which was a critical
component for the WTO accession strategy, and the Armenian Development Agency (ADA)'s initial period
of operations (by hiring consultants). This support was highly effective because it built ADA's capacity
and helped secure its reputation among the donor community. Donors demonstrated strong support for the
ADA, and by 2002, the ADA became a focal point of Government activities in investment promotion and
improvements in the business environment. The ADA also serves as a secretariat to the High Level
Business Council, chaired by the Prime Minister, which steers GOA's efforts toward a better investment
climate. The World Bank further supports the Government through the Foreign Investment and Export
Facilitation (FIEF) Credit (LIL), whose main objective is to advance the ADA's capacity building and
establishment of a one-stop window mechanism to inform the prospective investors about the country's
needs, resolve any outstanding administrative issues and bolster investors' confidence.

In National Census (satisfactory), SATAC2 helped development of a comprehensive census.                The
National Statistical Service (NSS) initiated the census under SATAC2 and managed to attract an additional
US$1-1.5 million in assistance from other donors. In this case, a small amount of SATAC2 of about
US$30,000 led to much larger donor funding without which it was not possible to complete the census in
Armenia.

4.4 Financial rate of return:

Not applicable.


4.5 Institutional development impact:

Substantial. SATAC2 had a strong institutional development impact because its technical inputs were
combined with policy reforms. Its support for privatization, particularly the EDCs and the Armenian
Savings Bank, was very successful in strengthening both institutions. Essential first steps of restructuring
the health sector, in general, and the hospital sector specifically were taken as well. The development
impact on the education sector was also substantial through the SATAC2 financing of the pilot of financial
reforms and capacity building for newly autonomous schools. SATAC2 also built capacity in the National
Statistical Service by catalyzing additional donor funds to implement a national census.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

The slow implementation and low ratings for 1999 were caused in large part by the changes in government
(including parliamentary elections in May 1999) and other political shocks (assassination of the Prime
Minister and Speaker of the Parliament in October 1999). There were also two government reshuffles in
early 2000. These political factors adversely affected the tendering and processing of consultant contracts.
Despite these major events and the serious concern over the political stability of the country, the attainment
of project development objectives was not adversely affected because of the availability of grant funding
from bilateral sources.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

Disbursement of SATAC2, as with earlier TAs, was slow. As the policy dialogue developed, other donors
used the Bank's dialogue and SATAC2 and the associated adjustment financing were instrumental in
securing substantial grant resources for Armenia.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

With the availability of grant funds, some IAs were not as motivated to pursue SATAC2 financed
activities. This was the case at the State Tax Service. The Customs Department created implementation
difficulties by frequent changes of management, as well as by delaying implementation of the ASYCUDA
system, which was linked to SATAC2's subcomponent on customs.

5.4 Costs and financing:

The total original credit amount was SDR3.6 million (US$5.0 million equivalent). Eighty-seven percent of
the credit amount (US$4.4 million) was disbursed. The credit was made on standard IDA terms with a
term of 35 years, a 10-year grace period, and an IDA service charge of 50 basis points on undisbursed
credit balances beginning 60 days after signing.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

The sustainability of SATAC2 is rated likely. The capacity built in various agencies of GoA will be
sustained in large part because the policy reforms that they supported were implemented and the built-up
capacity is in demand. In education for example, the success of the school rationalization is producing
benefits (in terms of incentives for budget savings and stronger community involvement) that will ensure
that the program is eventually extended to all schools. The optimization program in the health sector, by
definition, will lead to a more efficient use of the health sector budget. The capacity built at the Energy
Regulatory Commission (ERC) is expected to be sustained as electricity distribution has been privatized,
which will require greater independent regulatory services. Given the successful operations of the ERC,
under SAC5, the Government decided to expand its regulation responsibilities to cover the water and
telecom sectors. Financial sector capacity is also likely to be sustained because banks are now required to
follow IAS.     The privatization of the Armenian Savings Bank was another milestone that supports
sustainability. The ADA has been established, has earned sustained support from the donor community,
and has taken on the important roles of investment promotion and improving the environment for PSD.

GoA has expressed satisfaction with the recognition of the country's success in moving toward a market
economy, as well as its macroeconomic progress, and these factors as well as its continued involvement in
Bank, Fund, and other donor programs also make sustainability more likely.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

SAC5 was prepared and implemented to sustain the reform program and to address additional constraints
to private sector development. SAC5's emphasis on private sector development as well as social sector
reforms will make use of the capacities developed under SATAC2. There has been no indication that any
of the SATAC2 supported reforms would be reversed. One question is whether there was sufficient
technical assistance for SAC5, given the closure of SATAC2. SAC5 had adequate TA, because it had
additional support from a PHRD grant (for preparation), and from the USAID technical assistance
supported program.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

Satisfactory. The Bank pursued a continuation of the capacity building program that had been supported
by the IBTA and SATAC1 and was well-targeted against key development barriers. As in previous
adjustment operations, the Bank recognized the critical role of TA in supporting a long-term reform
program. The Bank was also effective in leveraging and coordinating a substantial amount of additional
donor assistance. The Bank, however, did not heed the lesson of earlier operations in Armenia and in the
region, that carrying out a TA to support institutional capacity building in under two years was unrealistic.
The Bank envisioned that SATAC2 would take 21 months to implement, when it actually took 64 months
(four extensions), more than three times the original plan (see next section for discussion of extensions).

7.2 Supervision:

Satisfactory. The Bank carried out close supervision throughout most of the project, as evidenced through
its good job of tracking progress and implementation issues reflected in the PSRs. The PSRs record all


                                                    - 11 -

major issues during implementation. The Bank agreed to keep SATAC2 running as a way to have
resources to support SAC3, SAC4 and SAC5 and demonstrated flexibility by modifying SATAC2 to be
more in line with the new (2001) CAS' emphasis on PSD. The Bank exercised firmness in supervision,
requiring that the implementation rating would have to improve to "satisfactory," in order to secure the
second extension and that this could be achieved only by completing seven benchmark activities (which the
Borrower did). These conditions were (i) hire consultants to support the operation of the ADA; (ii) hire
consultants to support the operation of the Central Depository of Armenia; (iii) announce tender for
modernization of the IT-system in the Treasury; (iv) announce tender for consultant services to convert
state-owned enterprises to IAS; (v) finalize the TOR for pension reform project; (vi) finalize the TOR for
the establishment of WTO Notification Center; and (vii) sign contract to facilitate IAS conversion in
state-owned enterprises. By the final year of the project, the Bank had approved four extensions.

The Bank faced two choices when confronted with the need for extensions, either cancel the undisbursed
portion of SATAC2 and begin the preparation of SATAC3, or simply extend SATAC2. In retrospect, the
Bank chose the more cost- and time-efficient approach of extending SATAC2. The activities were relevant
and necessary and the Government needed capacity to carry out the reform program.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:

Bank performance is rated satisfactory as both lending and supervision were satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

Satisfactory. The GoA was deeply involved in the design of SATAC2 as part of the overall reform dialog
leading up to SAC2. The Borrower also recognized the importance of TA "resources to carry out relevant
studies to precede legislative and procedural changes necessary to implement SAC3-supported reforms in a
timely manner" in its contribution to the SAC3 ICR.

7.5 Government implementation performance:

Satisfactory. The GoA effectively employed the SATAC2 resources to support three fully implemented
adjustment operations and preparation of a fourth. The GoA was also agreeable to the adjustments of the
activities of SATAC2 to better complement the needs of SAC3, SAC4 and SAC5. The Government was
slow implementing at times because of weak inter-ministerial coordination. This coordination improved in
the latter part of the project. The Government's procedures for contracting consultants could be more
streamlined, especially in the case of small contracts.

7.6 Implementing Agency:

Satisfactory. There was a wide range of implementation performance amongst implementing agencies
from highly satisfactory to unsatisfactory. Examples of this range of performances are found in sections 4
and 5. Although a couple of the IAs were not fully committed to implementing SATAC2 as designed, the
majority were, and performed well. The PIU functioned well, providing a good quality of technical support
to individual ministries.   The PIU did appear to lack leverage within the Government to accelerate
implementation when it was needed. Weaknesses in the PIU's procurement capacity were addressed with a
procurement workshop in Yerevan in October 2000.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:

The major elements of borrower performance were satisfactory as is overall borrower performance.

8. Lessons Learned


A TA project provides valuable support for preparing and strengthening implementation of an
adjustment operation and it makes sense to extend and adapt the TA projects in line with the changes
in emphasis of policy reform. The SATAC2 experience reconfirms that a TA project can be used to
provide whatever funds are needed to design and implement a sustainable adjustment operation. SATAC2
is notable for supporting four adjustment operations. The ability to restructure SATAC2 proved that a TA
can be extended and adapted to the changes in emphasis of policy reform. SATAC2 provided considerable
flexibility to both the Government and the Bank to address some critical knowledge gaps as the reform
process unfold.

The Bank needs to take a more realistic view of the time it takes to carry out TA-supported capacity
building. It was clear from earlier operations in Armenia and elsewhere that 21 months was a serious
underestimate of the time to build capacity for major economic reforms. The ICR for SAC3 recognized the
difficulties in carrying out, for example, strategic privatization, which SATAC2 supported.

Better donor coordination at the outset would more accurately signal the availability of grant funding
preferred by the Borrower. This coordination would help minimize the "shopping around" phenomenon,
which impeded implementation of several components of SATAC2.

A TA can leverage additional amounts for capacity building from other donors. SATAC2 had impact
well beyond its US$4.4 million in disbursements because it identified activities that other donors found
attractive and were willing to support with much larger amounts of grant financing as in the case of USAID
financial sector support, the national census through the NSS, and the continued donor funding of the ADA
after SATAC2 had provided initial support.

Bank TA can complement other donor funding in an important way by financing the use of local
consultants. During the reform years, Armenian local consulting capacity has increased substantially and
offers a pool of expertise with knowledge of local conditions. During SATAC2 some donors, by rule, were
not allowed to finance local consultants. The Bank was, however, able to finance these consultants who
provided valuable contributions to activities financed largely by these donors.

          SECOND STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CREDIT

         The Structural Adjustment Technical Assistance Credit (SATAC2) supported four structural
adjustment operations launched with SAC2, which was fully disbursed by the end of 1997 and then went
on to support key areas of the SAC3, SAC4 and SAC5. Noteworthy that launching as a technical
assistance (TA) for macroeconomic policy-oriented credits as SAC2 and SAC3 was, SATAC2 after some
restructuring in mid-2000 added also a component for Private Sector Development.




                                                      - 13 -

          Now SATAC2 provides TA in the following spheres: (i) resource mobilization, (ii) energy sector
reforms, (iii) public information and judicial reforms, (iv) privatization, (v) capital market development,
(vi) financial sector, (vii) social protection, (viii) health, (ix) education, (x) private sector development.

          TA funding through SATAC2 provided sufficient amount of resources to carry out relevant studies
to precede legislative and procedural changes necessary to implement reforms in a timely manner.

          The Government considers the progress of SATAC2 as satisfactory for most of the project life and
components:
·         Privatization: pilot program of Initial Public Offerings, privatization of the Armenian Savings
Bank and Electricity Distribution Companies (EDCs).
·         Capital market and financial sector: setting up a National Depository Institution, help to
commercial banks and joint-stock companies in moving towards International Accounting Standards.
·         Energy: reorganization of the Ministry of Energy, strengthening of the Energy Regulatory
Commission, supporting the transaction with EDCs.
·         Social protection: substantial improvements in targeting of social benefits and in developing
pension reform strategy.
·         Health and education: shifting hospital funding away from capacity-based toward service
delivery-based one, the target of assistance in the education sphere was training of administrative staff.
·         Private sector development: implementation of new system of managing of publicly owned real
estate, support of the WTO Notification Center.

          Certain elements of reforms, especially in the resource mobilization were less successful. There
was disagreement between Bank and Ministry of Finance and Economy with the proposal for dual-use
satellite system for enforcement. Some problems were raised regarding the contracting the consultant for
producing a financial management system.
