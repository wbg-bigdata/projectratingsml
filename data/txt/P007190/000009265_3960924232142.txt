PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report (PCR) on Guatemala's
Highway Maintenance Project, for which a loan for US$17.0 million was
approved by the Executive Directors on May 20, 1980. The loan is 952
lisbursed. The undisbursed balance of US$898,330 was cancelled.
This PCR was prepared by the Bank's Latin America and the
Caribbean Regional Office and is based upon information obtained from the
Minutes of the Board Meeting, the LAC Information Center, the Appraisal
Report No. 2826b-GU, staff supervision reports, consultant's reports and a
Project completion Report prepared by the Borrower.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation DEpartment
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The PCR was sent to
the Borrower for comments; the Borrower's reply is attached as Annex 1 and
reflected An paragraphs 3.05 and 7.03 of the PCR.

fIG8AT N&INTUANCE PROJECT (LOAN 1846-GU)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
The Highway Maiiutenance Project had the main objective of
serengthening the road umaintenance organlzation, and to improve and
ratio,a1ize maintenance procedures and standards. To this end, the project
includet:  (i) the acquisition of maintenance equipment, spare parts and
workshop tools necessary to meet the requirements of a four-year road
maintenance program; and (ii) technical assistance to strengthen the General
Directorate for Roads'(DGC) technical and managerial capabilities (paras 2.02
and 2.03).
Implementation Experience
The project experienced serious implementation delays from the
outset. The main reasons for delays were an eight-month delay in loan
effectiveness, the varying degrees of support that different administrations
gave to the maintenance program, problems in filling counterpart positions,
and cumbersome procurement procedures. In particular, because the equipment
acquisition was completed only in mid-1985, when the loan was approaching its
closing date, the road network continued to deteriorate and, An the
institutional front, progress in the implementation of the maintenance
management system developed under the project was below original expectations
(para 3.01).
In 1985, the arrival in Guatemala of the new equipment and the
increased support given by the Government to the maintenance program gave new
impetus to the delivery of the technical assistance. The Maintenance
Management System developed by the consultants was implemented first in two
maintenance districts and, after the consultants' departure, in the rest of
the country. Although the system still requires substantial fine-tuning to
become fully operational, the sustailnability of its benefits has been enhanced
by the recent decision of the Goverment to create, within DGC, a Maintenance
Engineering Department staffed by those professionals originally serving on a
temporary basis as local counterparts to the expatriate consultants
(para 3.07).
Results, Sustainability and Findings
The Projuct Completion Report draws the following conclusions:
After the initial implementation problems were overcome, the project
was successful in ensuring a sufficient supply of equipment to carry out the
maintenance program. Although the objectives of strengthening the road
maintenance organization and systematizing maintenance procedures and
standards were unly partially achieved, the project was instrumental in
raising the Government's awareness of the need for such organizational



- vi -
improvements and in setting the bases for future efforts in this area
(para 7.01).
In retrospect, and considering that the loan was practically the
first Bank operation in the subsector in Guatemala, project design did not
include safeguards to ensure that the minimum requirements for a successful
implementation were satisfied (para 7.03). Based upon this conclusion, the
project offers the follov:ing lessons (para 7.03):
(a) successful institutional development requires a strong Government
commitment. Agreement by the Borrower to accept a technical
assistance package designed by the Bank (andL many times perceived as
imposed by the Bank) is not in itself an indication of such
commitment. The Bank should endeavor to establish a meaningful
dialogue at the political, managerial, and technical levels so as to
jointly develop a thorough understanding of the problems and their
possible solutions;
(b) a program to foster institutional development must be designed
flexibly, to allow continuous adjustment, based upon learning and
innovative problem-solving, rather than upon the routine application
of solutions determined during an earlier planning and design phase;
and
(c) in the case of the subject project, a joint evaluation, as discussed
in (a) above, would have made evident both that the technical
assistance was not fully supported by the Government and that DGC
was an institution too weak to benefit from the type of assistance
proposbd by the Bank. The recognition of these facts during the
early stages of project design should have suggested to the Bank the
need to consider institution-building components better suited to
local circumstances.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GUATEMALA
HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT (LOAN 1846-GU)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Guatemala relies heavily upon its highway network for
transportation, with an estimated 95% of all ton-km and almost all
passenger-km being handled by road vehicles. The relatively small size of the
country and the geographical concentration of the developed regions lying
within a day's drive from Guatemala City have contributed to the predominance
of highirays in the country's transport system. Other modes are either in a
st&te of decline (such as the 785 km of railways) or serve very specific types
of Literval transport demand (such as two pipelines and domestic air
serv' es). Tnternational cargo and passenger movements are served by four
ports, Lwo od the Atlantic and two on the Pacific, and by the international
airpor  in Guatemala City.
1.02      The road network of Guatemala consists of 2,800 km of paved roads
and 15,300 1m of gravel and earth roads.  After approximately 20 years of
intensive road construction the basic road network, connecting the developed
regions if the country, is now in place. Emphasis in highway planning has
therefore shifted to maintenance and :ehabilitation, to arrest the severe road
deterioration caused by years of neglect. Construction and maintenance of the
road network fall under the jurisdictiou of five government agencies, with the
General Directorate for Roads (DGC) under the Ministry of Communications,
Transport and Public Works (MCTOP) playing the dominant role, and having full
jurisdiction over the trunk highway system, to wtiose improvemeht this loan was
addressed.
1.03      The Bank made a loan to the highway subsector (Loan 124-GU, 1955,
US$18.2 million) to assist in completing the construction of 435 km of the
main trunk highway system and executing a three-year maintenance program. In
July 1976, six months after the February 1976 earthquake, a small port
component (US$2.3 million) was included in the US$26.5 million Farthquake
Reconstruction Project (Loan 1314-GU). The Righway Maintenance Project,
subject of this report, was the Bank's first involvement in the highway
subsector after a hiatus of more than 15 years, during which the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the Central American Bank for Economic
Development (CABEI) and the US Agency for International Development (USAID)
contributed substantially to road sector financing.
1.04      This completion report Is based upon information obtained from the
Minutes of the Board Meeting, RWak's Record Center, LAC Information Center,
project appraisal and supervision reports, the Borrower's Project Completion
Report and reports prepared by the consultants involved in project execution
and supervision.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
2.01      The need for improving highway maintenance had been recognized by
the Government as a priority in the National Development Plan (1979-1981).
This was the basic policy decision upon which a comprehensive highway
maintenance program was developed, with objectives designea to be gradually
achieved over a period of four years, 1981-1985. The program was prepared
through the joint efforts of the staff of the General Directorate of Roads
and the National Council for Economic Planning (CONAPLAN), as well as by
individual consultants engaged by the Bank. The Highway Maintenance Project
was to finance the non-recurrent expenditures necessary to achieve the buildup
of maintenance capacity necessary to fulfill the program.
2.02      The pro,ect objectives, as described in the Appraisal Report were:
(a) to strengthen the road maintenance organization at headquarters and
in the field, and to improve and rationalize maintenance procedures
and standards;
(b) to upgrade, through training, maintenance personnel at all levels,
4.e., professional, technical, and field;
(c) to broaden the application of labor-intensive techniques in
maintenance operations; and
(d) to ensure a sufficient supply of maintenance equipment and vehicles,
and to improve the availability and utilization of the fleet.
2.03      To achieve its objectives, the project was to provide the following:
(i) Equipment
(a) replacement of old maintenance equipment and vehicles which had
become obsole::e and/or beyond economical repair, and
acquisition r,f new maintenance equipment and vehicles to meet
the requiremAents of the proposed program;
(b) buildup of spare parts stock for preventive maintenance of
existing and new equipment and vehicles, and acquisition of
spare parts for major overhauls of salvageable units;
(c) acquisition of workshop tools and equipment for improvement of
maintenadce workshops;
(d) acquisition of hand tools for labor-intensive road maintenance
operations; and
(e) equipment for a road condition diagnostic unit.
(ii) Technical Assistance
(a)  consulting services to:   (i) strengthen DGC's technical and
managerial capabilities to implement the program; (ii) help



-3-
establish a permanent training section; (ill) develop and carry
out a training program; (iv) advise on improving labor
protuctivity through the proper application of labor-intensive
tectiniques; and (v) advise on the carrying out of economic and
engineering studies to prepare a program for rehabilitation and
strengthening of earth, gravel and paved roads; and
(b) acquisition of equipment, construction of facillties and
provision of scholarships for lmplementlng the training
program.
2.04      The project was appralsed in September 1979, and negotiations were
held ln Washington between April 7 and April 17, 1980. A loan of US$17.0
million was approved by the Board of Executive Directors on May 20, 1980. The
approved project elements and their estlmated costs, as given In the appraisal
report, are shown on the following page.

IIl. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS
A.   General
3.01      The project experienced serious implementation delays from the
outset, An eight-month delay in completing the formalities for Congressional
approval of the Loan Agreement, followed by a fluctuating degree of support
given by successive administrations to the program, problems in filli.ig
counterpart positiona, and lengthy and cumbersome procurement procedures
contributed to the project achieving lover-than-expected results. In
particular, because the equipment acquisition was completed only in mid-1985,
when the loan was approaching its closing date, the maintenance work actually
carried out during the project period was very limited. This resulted not
only in the continued physical deterioration of the road network but, in the
institutional front, in difficulties in making full use of the maintenance
management system developed under the project. What follows is a discussion
of the implementation of each of the project components.
B.   Equipment, Parts and Tools
(i) Procurement
3.02      Preparation of the specifications and bidd*ng documents for new road
maintenance equipment and identification of the spare parts needed for
equipment overhaul started in November 1980, upon arrival of the equipment
expert from the consultants' team. However, inexperience of DGC's personnel
in handling ICB procedures, successive changes in DGC management personnel and
the limited interest shown in the maintenance program delayed the start of the
procurement process. In March 1982, a new Government took office. While
support for the project by the new administration experienced a substantial
improvement, further delays were caused by the Government's decision to review
the general legal framework for the procurement of goods and services in the
country.
3.03      The equipment and spare part acquisition process had a false start
in early 1983. This was followed by a new call for bids in April 1984, which
was voided because none of the bidders complied with legal prerequisites.
The procurement process finally took-off in mid-1984 and was mostly completed
by mid-1985. Additional purchases, mostly of spare parts, took place in
1986. About US$9.2 million of equipment for road maintenance, Road Diagnostic
Unit, and maintenance workshops were financed under the loan. Acquisition of
spare parts amounted to about US$4.7 million.
(ii) Overhauling of Maintenance Equipment
3.04      Early in the project implementation period, the technical assistance
consultants prepared a program for reconditioning existing maaintenance
equipment, to be implemented in two phases: a first phase, comprising the
overhaul of 71 units for which only a limited supply of spare parts was
necessary, and a second phase, consisting in repairing 265 units once the bulk
of the spare parts procured under the loan had arrived. Delays in the
purchase of spare parts substantially slowed down the implementation of this



-6 -
component. Furtlhermore, overhauling needs had to be continually revised due
to the cannibalization of existing units prior to the start of the unit
maintenance and repair program. Finallv, only 81 units of equipment were
reconditioned under the project, about 24% of the original target. The
proFram, however, continues to be implemented with the use of the spare parts
financed under the loan.
(iii) Civil Works for Training Facilities
3.05      This component comprised of civil works for the construction of
training facilities. The training facilities were constructed near the Central
Workshop at Las Vacas, near Guatemala City, instead of the Las Vacas site
as planned. Total cost of these civil works amounted to US$66,000, about 47%
below appraisal estimates. The substantial difference between the appraisal
estimated and actual cost of this project item is mostly due to an original
overestimation of costs.
C.   Institutional Improvements. Training and Studies
(i) Strengthening of DGC's Road Maintenance Capability
3.06      The joint venture of US and Guatemalan consulting firms retained by
the Government to provide tech-ical assistance for strengthening DGC's road
maintenance management started work in Guatemala in late 1981. During the
first two years of their assignment, progress was extremely slow, as their
work was hampered by the following factors:
(a)  Local Counterpart Staff.  As a condition for loan effectiveness, DGC
hired four maintenance engineers that were to serve as local
counterparts to the expatriate experts. However, by the time of the
arrival of the consultants, three of them had quit' their jobs
because of unacceptably low salaries. To solve this problem, DGC
engaged maintenance engineers on a temporary basis, with salaries
above those in the civil service scale. This process delayed the
full initiation of the consultants' activities and, as explained in
the following paragraph, had a negative impact upon the integration
of the consulting group with DGC;
(b)  Relationship of the Technical Assistance Staff and DGC.  The
expatriate consultants, together with the local counterparts became
de facto a parallel agency, completely divorced from the mainstream
of DGC. Lack of Government interest in the technical assistance,
the resentment of the lower-paid DGC staff, and insufficient rapport
1!etween the consultants aned the DGC contribdted to this situation.
As a result, the group devoted the first two years of the technical
assistance contract to the development of equipment management
systems and systems for planning, programming, and controlling
maintenance activities, but with very little interaction with the
operational units of DGC; and
(c)  Lack of Resources/Budgetary Constraints.  During the first stages of
project implementation, the consultants' work was made difficult by
the lack of physical facilities, vehicles, and other resources
necessary to carry out their task. These problems were later



-7-
compounded by inordinate delays in the procurement of equipment,
spare parts and tools critical for the implementation of the
program. Even after these problems were finally overcome,
inadequate budgetary allocations continued to hamper the maintenance
program. In particular, the practice of the Ministry of Finance of
earmarking maintenance funds for specific items on an ad hoc basis
resulted in an unbalanced budget.  As a result, insufficient funds
were allocated to the purchase of fuel, asphalt, and other
essentials. This had a negative Impact on the implementation of the
consultants' program.
3.07      In 1985, the arrival in Guatemala of the new equipment and the
increased support given by the rovernment to the maintenance program, improved
the delivery of the technical assistance. The Maintenance Management System
developed by the consultants was implemented first in two maintenance
districts and, after the consultants' departure, in the rest of the country.
Although the system still requires substantial fine-tuning to become fully
operational, the sustaintability of its benefits has been enhanced by the
recent decision of the Government to create, within DGC, a Maintenance
Engineering Department staffed by those professionals originally serving on a
temporary basis as local counterparts to the expatriate consultants.
(ii) Training
3.08      The implementation of the four-year (1981-1984) training program
progressed slowly and unevenly, not only because of delays in ordering and
receiving essential workshop equipment, tools and spare parts, but also
because of shortage of counterpart instructors, limited support from DGC's
management, insufficient leadership from the consulting training specialists
and lack of funds. In addition, program implementation was delayed by the
slow progress in completing the construction of the central administrative
offices for the DGC Training Department, the workshop, and a dormitory for
resident trainees of the Mechanical Training Production Unit.
3.09      With the completion of the necessary training facilities in 1985,
the program gathered momentum and was able, to a significant extent, to make
up for the delays experienced during the first two years of implementation.
The original target of training 989 DGC staff on field maintenance work,
administration, and workshop practices, was achieved in 1985, only one year
later than scheduled. This remarkable improvement after the initial sluggish
performance is largely due to the good organization, competence and
effectiveness of the Guatemalan instructors. Because of the existing high use
of labor in the Guatemalan economy, training gave special emphasis to the
implementation of labor intensive road maintenance methods.
(iii) Preparation of a four-year road rehabilitation and
strengthening program
3.10      The technical assistance consultants collaborated in the preparation
of a four-year rehabilitation and strengthening program for the paved road
network under DGC's jurisdiction. In this context, the Borrower, as required
by the Loan Agreement, established in July 1982 a Road Condition Diagnostic
Unit to evaluate the state of the road network and identify road
rehabilitation needs.



-8-
3.11      The road rehabilitation program was successfully completed in late
1984 and approved by CONAPLAN, the country's Planning Council, in February
1985. It included an economic evaluation of the work required in some 3,000 km
of the national road network, and estimates of the investments required for the
rehabilitation of 1,000 km of high priority roads.
IV. COST ESTIMATES AND DISBURSEMENTS
4.01      A comparison of appraisal estimates and final costs is shown in
Table 1. Savings resulted from: (a) the strengthening of the dollar, in a
project with a high content of imported goods and services; and (b) the good
response by suppliers to bid invitations, after the initial difficulties in
procurement procedures were overcome. In spite of the procurement of additional
spare parts and the need to extend the consultants' services, the project was
implemented at a cost 8Z below original estimates.
4.02      The allocation of loan funds was revises  twice, as shown in the
following table, to increase ftnds under categories Equipment for Workshop and
Laboratories, Spare Parts, and Con&ulting Services and Training:

4.03      As shown in Table 2, disbursements lagged behind appraisal estimates
throughout the life of the project. This was mainly due to delays in project
implementation because of frequent changes in the Government and cumbersome
procurement procecfures. Hbwever, the pace picked up in 19w& and US>ib.l million
were disbursed as of May 26, 1987. The undisbursed balance of US$0.9 million for
Loan 1846-GU was cancelled.
V. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
5.01      At appraisal, the economic evaluation wa  carried out at two levels:
first, to select the most appropriate road maintenance policy, and second, to
assess the economic feasibility of the scale and composition of the proposed
project, based upon the selected maintenance policy. Three alternative
maintenance policies (good, fair and minimum) were developed to correspond with
three levels of road surface condition as measured principally in terms of
roughness.  Road conditions, then, would improve or deteriorate according to the
maintenance policy applied to a given road segment. This method served as the
basis to evaluate the various policies and the proposed program.
5.02      The original economic evaluation considered that the quantifiable
direct benefits to be generated by improved maintenance practices would be the
savings in vehicle operating costs due to improved riding surface. Using the
HDM model, the economic evaluation yielded an internal rate of return (ERR)
above 1002. Several sensitivity tests were conducted to assess the program's
feasibility under varying circumstances. The tests showed that the lowest
returns corresponded with a two-year delay in the accrual of benefits. In
that case, the ERR would be reduced to 51%.
5.03      Because of the delays in implementing the maintenance program, most of
the road network of Guatemala deteriorated to an extent in which maintenance was
no longer an economic solution.1/ As a result, the economic reevaluation of
the project was based upon the following assumptions:
(a) Because of present road conditions, only 302 of the network can be
maintained. A road rehabilitation and reconstruction plan will be
put into effect in 1988, aimed at a gradual increase of the network
that could be maintained. It was estimated that, in the 'without
project case,' without the equipment which was purchased and the
institutional improvements which were fostered, by 1995 only 50% of
the network could be maintained by DGC. In the 'with project case,'
992 of the network could receive some form of routine and/or
periodic maintenance;
(b) Maintenance costs for paved roads were estimated at Q 1,450 pver km
for roads in good condition and Q 1,700 km for roads In poor
1/ In 1979, 66Z of the road network under DGC's responsib.l_ty was in fair
to poor condition. By 1984, that proportion reached 94%.



- 10 -
condition. In the case of earth roads, those costs are Q 1,100 per
km and Q 1,400 per km respectively;
(c)  Traffic levels and road conditions are shown in Table 3.  Vehicle
operating costs, calculated with the HDM model, appear on Table 4.
The latter are based upon averages for hilly terrain; and
(d)  The analysis covers the period 1980-1995, since the equipment
purchased under the project wvll reach the end of its useful life by
1995.
5.04      The analysis yielded an estimated ERR of 126Z, in line with the
original estimate (Table 5). The ex-post rate of return surpasses that
estimated at appraisal for the case in which the accrual of benefits was.
postponed by two years. This is mostly due to a lower-than-envisaged real
cost of the investments and, to a certain extent, to the greater benefits that
result from carrying out maintenance work in a highly deteriorated network.
The increase in deterioration that actually took place was not foreseen at
appraisal.
VI, INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
6.01      As discussed in Chapter III (para 3.06), several factors contributed
to the lower-than-expected achievements in institution-building under the
project. However, recent developments provide a basis for an optimistic
outlook regarding future progress on this front. These are: (i) the present
administration is fully aware of the need for a systematic programming,
planning, and monitoring of road maintenance activities in order to arrest the
rapid deterioration of the network; (ii) the Government created, in 1986, a
Maintenance Engineering Department within DGC, staffed by those professionals
originally serving on a temporary basis as local counterparts to the technical
assistance consultants; and (iii) the implementation of the maintenance
management system at the national level is continuing after the departure of
the consultants.
6.02      It is clear that, during its final stages, the project served as a
vehicle to impress upon the Government the need to systematize its road
maintenance operations. As a consequonce, the initial results obtained in
this area under the project (inter alia, improvements in road maintenance
budgetary control, establishment of a Road Diagnostic Unit, carrying out a
road condition inventory, development of a supply and distribution system for
spare parts, implementation of a maintenance management system) should now
provide a solid foundation on which to continue strengthening DGC's
maintenance capabilities.
6.03      Achievemeats under the project, however, are only incipient.  Major
efforts will be required to make the maintenance management system a useful
tool for the decision making process. In particular, the high turnover of DGC
staff requires a continuing intensive effort in training, as new staff are
inducted, and personnel at all levels in DGC muit learn how to operate within



- - 11 -
the system and contribute to its efficiency. Also, field data collection
should Improve substautially as the system becomes fully operational. Field
informatim *bould assist in identifying and correcting the major cauees of
low prodacti vty of labor and equlpment. A follow-up project, currently under
preparation, Lcludes a component to further strengthen the sector's leading
Institution, and, in particular, reinforce the work carried out In
establishing the maintenance management systas.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      After the Initial implementation problems were overcome, the project
was finally successful in achieving its objective to ensure a sufficient
supply of equipment and vehicles to carry oUt the maintenance program.
However, the road saintenance work actually carried out was limited, and
insufficient to arrest the severe road deterioration of the network. The
objectives of strengthening the road maintenance organization at headquarters
and in the field, and to systematize maintenance procedures and standards were
only partly achieved. The project, however, was instrumental in raising the
Government's awareness of the need for such organizational improvements  and
in setting the bases for future efforts in this area.
7.02      In retrospect, and considering that the loan was pract$ ;ally the
first Bank operation in the subsector in Guateusla, project design did not
include safeguards to ensure that the minimum requirements for a successful
implementation were satisfied. More specifically, the degree of the.
Government's commitment toward the project and the institutional setting for
an effective delivery of technical assistance, were not appropriately assessed
during project preparation. Furthermore, the project did not include the
necessary instruments to closely monitor progress In Implementation and apply
remedial actions when required.
7.03      With hindsight, and in view of the limited experience that DGC's
staff had with ICB procedures and the cumbersome Interpretation of those
procedures, the time period necessary for equipment acquisition was
underestimated at appraisal. The project did serve as a vehicle for
developing local experience with International bidding. Nevertheless, in
future operations, during project preparation, agreement should be reached
with the Borrower on provisions for expediting procurement procedures, taking
into consideration a realistic time frame for introducing the required reforms.
7.04      The project offers some valuable lessons on key issues:
(a)  Successful institutional development is a complex task that requires,
as a necessary prerequisite, a strong Government commitment. Agreement
by the Borrower to accept a technical assistance package designed
by the Bank (and many times perceived as imposed by the Bank) is
not in itself an indication of such commitment. The Eank
should endeavor to establish a meaningful dialogue with the Borrower at the
political, managerial, and technical levels so as to jointly develop a thoroug
understanding of the problems and their possible solutions. In this context,



-.1? -
initial planning and design of a program to improve institutional
capacity should in itself be viewed as the first phase of
implementation through the direct involvement of those whose
capacity is to be improved;
(b) A program to foster institutional development must be designed
flexibly, to allow continuous adjustment, based upon learning and
innovative problem-solving rather than on the routine application of
solutions determined during an earlier planning and design phase;
and
(c) In the case of the subject project, a joint evaluation, as discussed
in (a) above would have determined at an early stage that the
technical assistance as proposed by the Bank was not supported by
the Government of the day. In addition, such a joint approach would
have mad! evident that DGC was an institution too weak to fully
benefit from the type of assistance included under the project. The
recognition of these circumstances during the early stages of
project design, should have suggested to the Bank the need to
consider a staging for the introduction of institution-building
components better suited to local circumstances.

LA2IE       JVS:clh
Ministry of Communications, Transportation and Public Works
Republic of Guatemala
No.: 03 000077                                      January 25, 1988
Ref: 128-650.3/JLPh/eom
The President, World Bank
Washington D.C.
Dear Sir:
I am writing in regard to the Project Completion Report you prepared
on the Highway Maintenance Project (Loan 1846-GU).
The report was reviewed by Luis Guillermo Ponce Navarro, Technical
Advisor in the Directorate General of Highways, and by Jorge Mario Gonzalez
0'Meany, Luis Francisco Vald6s Reyes and Manuel Alfredo Alvarez Porras, who
worked as counterpart personnel on the said project. Their conclusion is that
the report is generally an accurate account of thb achievements of the project
and of the deficiencies that affected its execution.
We would like to make the following specific comments:
1.   The civil works for the training facilities referred to in para.
3.05 were executed near the Central Workshops of the Directorate
General of Highways in Guatemala City, rather than the Las Vlacas
Workshop in Highway Zone No. 1, as originally planned.
2.   In para. 3.06 (c) reference is made to the fact that project
execution was affected by inadequate budget allocations,
particularly because the authorizations approved by the Ministry of
Public Finance were insufficient for the purpose of purchasing fuel,
asphalt, spare parts and other essential items. We have insisted to
the Ministry of Public Finance on the need for adequate
appropriations to enable the Maintenance Division to carry out its
tasks properly.
3.   Almost US$900,000 of the loan was not used.  It would be desirable
if in similar cases authority could in future be given for
unutilized balances to be applied to meeting Guatemala's real needs.
4.   Finally, we hope it is appropriate to recommend that in future
projects Bank missions should take careful note of the opinions of
officials in the Directorate General of Highways regarding the
amount of time required in practice for contracting works and for
other procedures under current legislation, so that from the
beginning the proposed actions can reflect circumstances in
Guatemala and that the necessary changes can gradually be
introduced, as recommended in para. 7.04 (c) of the report.
Yours, etc.
(signed) Moises Ramirez Quintanilla
Deputy Miniater of Communications, Transportation and Public Works
