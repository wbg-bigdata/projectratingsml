WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (CR 2389-MAU)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Water Supply Project of
Mauritania, for which Credit 2389-MAU, in the amount of SDR 7.7 million (US$10.5 million
equivalent), was approved on June 17, 1992 and declared effective on March 16, 1993.
Credit 2389-MAU was closed on February 28, 1998, seven months after the original
closing date. The last disbursement took place on May 4, 1998, and the balance of SDR 2.0
million (US$2.7 million equivalent) was canceled. Parallel financing for the project in the amount
of US$0.5 milion was provided by French Development Agency (AFD).
The ICR was prepared by Gerard Tenaille (Consultant) and Eleanor Warner (Financial
Analyst) and reviewed at a meeting dated September 28, 1998X chaired by Mr. Hasan A. Tuluy,
Country Director for Mauritania. The Borrower contributed to the ICR preparation through
SONELEC, the operating company, drawing up its own implernentation completion report, which
is summarized in Appendix B.
Preparation of this report began during the Bank's February 1998 supervision/completion
mission to Mauritania led by Mr. Jan G. Janssens. The ICR is based on project documents,
correspondence, the appraisal report, the Credit and Project Agreements. Comments were also
received from staff involved at different stages of the project which have been incorporated into
the ICR.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURIT'ANIA
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (CR 2389-MAU)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
i.    This Implementation Completion Report evaluates the outcome of the Water Supply
Project of Nouakchott (CR 23 89), implemented by the National Water and Electricity Company of
Mauritania (SONELEC).
Project Objectives and Components
ii.    The main objectives were to: (a) improve water supply service levels and alleviate poverty
in Nouakchott by providing adequate quantities of safe water to the poor section of the population
at an affordable price; (b) achieve financial self-sufficiency of the urban potable water sub-sector,
leading to sustained sector development; (c) improve sector management by strengthening
SONELEC, its financial and administrative departments, ancd its operation and maintenance
procedures; and (d) foster efficient groundwater management, protect and extend the finite life of
Nouakchott's only source of water.
iii.   The project's components were limited to: (a) a hydrologeological study at Tenadi
wellfield and monitoring at Idini; (b) rehabilitation and extension of the distribution network
including a leakage detection and repair program; and (c) technical assistance, preparatory studies
and audits.
Evaluation of Objectives
iv.    The project's objectives were clear and consistent with a long term sector development
strategy, but could not have been achieved by the components which were limited in scope.
Achievement of Objectives
v.    Achievement of the project's physical objectives was limited by an imbalance between
production capacity and distribution in the water network. The project focused on extending the
distribution system, but the benefits of the extended distribution could not be realized due to
limited supply and weak water pressures. These objectives could have been achieved if the project
had increased the water production at the Tenadi wellfield as originally intended (with AFD
financing), but which will only be launched after the close of the project.
vi.   Service Levels. The objective of improving the service levels and alleviating poverty in
Nouakchott by supplying adequate quantities of potable water to the low income populations, at an
affordable price, was partially satisfied. The standpipe installation and connections were done as
planned, but distribution to the poor was constrained by inadequate production capacity.



iii
vii.   Financial self-sufficiency of the sector. The project's financial objective of self-
sufficiency was attained through improved financial sector management and a relatively high tariff
(US$1.03/m3, one of the highest in sub-Saharan Africa) which was increased semi-annually as
planned. At the current tariff level, the sector is in financial equilibrium. However, it cannot
finance the cost of any significant future capital investment.
viii.  Sector Management Improvement. This objective of strengthening SONELEC was not
achieved and apart from financial management, SONELEC remains weak in all operational areas.
Weak capacity and continued inability to execute the project contributed to the cancellation of a
portion of the Credit.
ix.    Groundwater Management. This objective was not achieved. SONELEC failed to
follow the conclusions and recommendations of a major hydrogeological study of the Tenadi
wellfield, which was funded jointly by IDA and AFD. The study concluded that in order to protect
the Idini wellfield from salt water intrusion, new drilling should be discontinued, and production
reduced. SONELEC, however, continued its drilling program which has greatly increased the
probability of salt water intrusion into the Tenadi wellfield by year 2010.
x.    Donor Coordination. This objective was not achieved. In retrospect, because of the
limited donor participation, the objective of donor coordination was not essential and therefore
should not have been included as a development objective.
Results
xi.    The project partially accomplished the following: (a) a leak detection and repair program;
(b) a hydrogeological study for Tenadi; (c) repair of the distribution network; (d) a short-lived leak
detection program; (e) spare parts, materials and equipment for connections; and (f)
implementation of a cost accounting system.
Assessment of Project's Success and Sustainability
xii.   The project cannot be deemed a success as most of its objectives were not, or only
partially, achieved. While sustainability of the cost accounting system is probable as SONELEC
has demonstrated its capability of using and maintaining it, sustainability of the distribution
network is unlikely due to overall poor management. Specifically, the management cell for the
distribution network, which was set up to ensure good management, was disbanded before the end
of the project.
Bank Performance
xiii.   Bank performance overall is considered inadequate. The project's design was inadequate
as there was a mismatch between objectives and project components. The project underwent a
very long preparatory period, from January 1986 to October 1991, followed by a relatively speedy
appraisal in February 1992 and Board date of June 1992. The political environment in Mauritania
was unfavorable and commitment to sector improvements was unclear. There was doubt about
whether the project should go ahead, but it did. Supervision appeared to be satisfactory in light of
the project's context.



lv
Borrower Performance
xiv.   SONELEC's performance in project implementation was deficient as exemplified by: (i)
lengthy delays in procurement, caused in part by cumbersome national procedures; (ii) failure to
follow Bank procurement procedures; (iii) failure to fully comply with the objectives of the
performance contract; (iv) delays in disconnecting illegal cornections (for irrigation use); (v)
delays in preparing the Tenadi Project which should have been financed by AFD; and (vi) failure
to implement the recommendations of the hydrogeological studies.
Conclusions and Summary of Key Lessons
xv.   The outcome of this first Water Supply Project suggests that future operations would need
a more enabling and less bureaucratic environment to succeed. This could be achieved through
rigorous sector analysis prior to investing. Ownership at an early stage is a key factor for moving
ahead. Radical changes of the institutional and operating environment would be necessary.
xvi.   Countries/sectors with weak procurement procedures need to have them strengthened
and/or streamlined prior to project implementation. Even though SONELEC staff were sent to
Bank procurement courses, this proved insufficient. Complex rules of Government and the
country's bureaucratic environment were not conducive to quick procurement decision making.
Country specific constraints remained on how to deal with international goods and works.
xvii.  The project was launched at a time of transition for SONELEC when expatriates were
being replaced by local staf. The impact of this transition was not fully assessed at appraisal and
contributed to SONELEC's inability to adequately execute the project.
xviii.  Project components need to be designed to fit project objectives. In this case, the
objectives were quite elaborate against modest project components and so constrained the
attainment of objectives.
xix.   The planned parallel financing arrangement with AFD did not fully materialize. A lesson
from this experience is that in cases where the Bank has a partnership with donors, the Bank
should be sure that key agreements are in place no later than the date of effectiveness.
xx.   Finally, automatic tariff increases based on achieving a rate of return eliminate incentives
for a company to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The tariff was increased semi-annually as
required by the project, but this was not matched by cost reductions and did not lead to efficiency
improvements. Tariff adjustments should be based on reaching medium to long term sector financial
equilibrium rather than a target rate of return, which is usually based on fixed assets values which
are, at times, unreliable.

WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (CR 2389-MAU)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATIOPN ASSESSMENT
INTRODUCTION
1.    IDA's assistance to the water sector started in 1983, with the Public Enterprises Technical
Assistance and Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1567-MAU). In February 1986, a PPF advance of
US$500,000 was approved for hydrogeological studies of Idini groundwater. A second PPF
advance of US$500,000 was approved in June 1986 to extend the hydrogeological study to the
Tenadi well field (cofinanced by FAC). At about the same time, the FAC financed a Master Plan
for water supply of Nouakchott. In early 1987, it was concluded that the Idini well field would be
contaminated with saline water in about four to five years, and that of West Tenadi after 24 years
and that measures needed to be taken urgently to reduce drawdown at Idini while further studies
could be carried out. There was concern among the donors about the capacity of the sector
agency, SONELEC, to continue sector management. Discussions took place in 1987 and 1988
among the donors about possible reform measures, including privatization, but the Government
was not prepared to undergo a major reform of the sector. The project was conceived in this
context to assist in further development of the water sector.
A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
2.    The project objectives were to:
(a)   improve water supply service levels and alleviate poverty in Nouakchott by providing an
adequate quantity of safe water to the poor section of the population, at an affordable price;
(b)    achieve financial discipline and accomplish financial self-sufficiency of the urban water
supply sector, leading to sustained sector development;
(c)   improve the sector's management by strengthening SONELEC, its administrative and
financial departments, and its operating and maintenance procedures;
(d)    prepare a follow-up project in accordance with Parts II through V of the investment program;
(e)   foster efficient groundwater management, and protect and extend the finite life of
Nouakchott's only water source; and



2
(f)   improve donor coordination and induce other donors to participate in the financing of a
program securing an adequate water supply for Nouakchott in the medium term.
Statement of Project Components
3.    The project consisted of a set of actions covering Part I of a five-part investment program
including:
(a)    Two hydrogeological studies -- (i) monitoring of salt water intrusion in the Idini wellfield of
the Trarza aquifer; and (ii) a study to develop a groundwater management plan for the
exploitation of the new Tenadi wellfield, further -away from the advancing saline front and
development of a long-term water supply plan for Nouakchott;
(b)    Rehabilitation and Extension of the distribution network: (i) implementation of a leak
detection and repair program; (ii) rehabilitation of existing distribution network; (iii)
extension of the distribution system to the northern part of Nouakchott (the poorest suburbs);
(iv) supply of urgently required spare parts and materials for 6,000 house connections, 100
standpipes, and miscellaneous equipment;
(c)    Studies and Audits: Preparation of tender documents; technical assistance and completion of
studies required for completion of the remaining phases of SONELEC's investment
program; audits, revaluation of assets and miscellaneous social studies.
Evaluation of Project Objectives
4.    The objectives were clear and consistent with a long term sector development strategy, but
the project did not clearly support the objectives. The project financed only a limited number of
emergency supplies and materials to restore the system to a reasonable operational capacity and
some house connections and standpipes; this was intended to be the first of a five-tranched
investment program. The components should have been designed to fit the more elaborate
objectives. The project required significant improvements in financial performance and
covenanted a series of actions to lead to improved financial efficiency, but this was constrained by
the absence of components designed to increase the volume of water available for sale as only
limited improvements could be made in financial performance without an increase in water
production.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
5.    Achievement of the project's physical objectives was limited by an imbalance between
production capacity and distribution in the water network. The project focused on extending the
distribution system, but the benefits of the extended distribution could not be realized due to
limited supply and related weak pressures. The objectives could have been better achieved if the
project had increased the water production at the Tenadi wellfield as originally intended (with
AFD financing), but which will only be launched after the close of the project.
6.    The objective of improving service levels and alleviating poverty in Nouakchott by
supplying adequate quantities of potable water to the low income populations, at an affordable



3
price, was partially achieved. Installation of standpipes and connections was done as forecasted at
appraisal, but service levels were limited by weak network pressures which led to water rationing,
particularly at the standpipes.
7.    The objective of achieving financial discipline and financial self-sufficiency of the urban
water supply sector, leading to sustained sector development vas partially achieved, as shown in
Table 6 of Part II. A good cost accounting system was put in place and is functioning
satisfactorily. Procedures are in place for implementation of the new cost accounting and training
was provided to ensure its use and maintenance. Self-sufficiency has been achieved through high
tariffs. At the current level of tariffs the sector is in financial equilibrium. However, it cannot
accommodate the cost of financing any significant future capital investment. The average tariff
for Mauritania is now about the highest in sub-Saharan AiFrica, US$1.03/m3, compared with
US$0.67 for neighboring Senegal and US$0.62 for Cote d'Ivoire.
8.    The financial and operating ratios fixed by the performance contract have been partially
reached. Table 6 of Part II compares the objectives of the performance contract and the ratios
obtained by SONELEC. The global efficiency for electricity and water in 1996 was 82% and 72%,
against the objectives of 88% and 78%. Water efficiency fell from 76% in 1994 to 71% in 1995
and 72% in 1996. SONELEC would have benefitted from taking timely decisions to further
improve its financial performance. SONELEC, for example, after a lengthy delay, replaced 200
mm of asbestos pipes with cast iron pipe to prevent illegally connected consumers from tapping
the system. The need for prompt action was raised several times by IDA missions since 1992, but
was attended to only in early 1997. At a rate of about 4,000 m3/day over the five years,
SONELEC's water loss has been estimated at 7.3 million m3.
9.    The objective to improve sector management by strengthening SONELEC's financial and
administrative departments and operation procedures has not been achieved.  Capacity in
operations and maintenance remained weak throughout implementation; SONELEC's inability to
take timely decisions (particularly with respect to procurement) and effectively execute the project
is a contributory factor for cancellation of a portion of the credit. Only 74% of the Credit was
disbursed at the time of the extended Closing date.
10.   The objective to increase the efficiency of ground water management, protect and spread
the life of the only water source of Nouakchott, could have been achieved if the hydrogeological
studies financed by AFD had been undertaken as scheduled and the recommendations
implemented. However this objective was not achieved. The contract for monitoring Idini
remained unsigned four years after the start of the project because of failure to reach agreement
with the Government on the scope of the work. The hydrogeological study of the Tenadi wellfield
was carried out from 1993 to 1995 (financed by AFD) while IDA financed the test drillings. The
study recommended installation of 12 boreholes by 1997, 12 by year 2000 and reduction in
production at Idini simultaneously from 34,000 to 25,800 m3/day, then to 20,600 m3/day.
Contrary to the recommendations, SONELEC undertook to drill four new boreholes at Idini which
is now threatening the water table and increases the risks of it being depleted more rapidly than
forecast.

11.   The economic justification of the project's investments included two main elements: (i)
the approximate equalization of the standard water tariff with the long run marginal cost (LRMC)
of water production; and (ii) an estimation of an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of the project at
10% (with a slight underestimation due to non-tangible benefits such as consumer surplus and
health benefits). The calculations done for the ICR point out that the economic justification has
been reached and the actual internal rate of return of 12% (Table 9), has slightly exceeded the
SAR's 10% estimated rate. At the time of project appraisal, the LRMC was equal to the standard
tariff, US$1.37/m3. At the end of the project the standard water tariff for Mauritania is estimated
at US$1.03/m3. The LRMC (including capital investment) is approximately equal to the standard
water tariff and the project's economic justification maintained.
C. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE
12.   Implementation of the project started very slowly: signed in September 1992, the Credit
became effective in March 1993, the initial date of effectiveness having been postponed by three
months (from December 1992 to March 1993) due to delays in Govemment fulfilling fairly
straightforward conditions of effectiveness: (i) signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between
the Government and SONELEC; (ii) ratification of the performance contract by the Government;
(iii) settlement of Government arrears to SONELEC by end December 1991; (iv) recruiting of an
independent auditor; and (v) availability of the bidding documents for expansion of the
distribution network in Nouakchott.
13.   To help accelerate project start-up, a PPF of US$200,000 was granted by the Bank, (of
which only US$ 122,680 was used) to finance final design studies and preparation of bidding
documents for expanding the distribution network.
14.   Hydrogeological monitoring of Idini wellfield. This work, which should have been
financed by the AFD, was never carried out (para. 10). A contract is now being negotiated.
15.   Study of the Tenadi wellfield. This work was partly completed -- a study was done
financed jointly by AFD (consultant fees) and IDA (necessary test drillings, on condition that AFD
financed the water supply study of Rosso for the follow-on project). Preparation of the new
project has been halted following disagreements on the exploitation of the Tenadi field. The
complementary study of Rosso was not carried out.
16.   Leak detection and repair program. This component was carried out, but not very
effectively. Leak detection equipment was planned to be purchased before launching the program,
including training of SONELEC personnel, but the equipment was delivered too late for the
program. The program was carried out with equipment lent by the Nouadhibou department and
the consultant. The training portion was also carried out but, lacking equipment, the team was
dispersed. The objective to create a permanent management cell for the distribution network was
not achieved. The consultant has nevertheless prepared, at the completion of the leak detection
campaign, bid documents for rehabilitation of the network.
17.   Rehabilitation of the distribution network. This component should have been financed
by SONELEC. The bid documents were ready in December 1995, but the bidding process was
never completed.



5
18.   Supply of urgently required spare parts. This material should have been financed by
SONELEC. A contract was signed in 1993, but it was canceled by SONELEC after the supplier
requested additional funds to compensate for the devaluation of the ouguiya.
19.   Supply of materials for house connections and standpipes. A portion of these materials
was included in the network extension works contract; the same contractor carried out most of the
house connections.
20.   Purchase of miscellaneous equipment. This item was the subject of another lengthy
bidding process; IDA gave its no objection on May 24, 1996, to the proposal of contract award. A
year later, in May 1997, the contract was still not signed.
21.   Construction of house connections and standpipes. Most of the connections and
standpipe installation were carried out in the framework of the network expansion contract. Others
will be executed by SONELEC, at its own expense.
22.   Distribution system expansion. Submission of the bidding documents, financed by the
PPF, was a condition of the IDA Credit effectiveness. The bidding for this package was launched
rapidly, but SONELEC refused to proceed to pre-qualification of the firms. The Bank accepted on
the condition that a post-qualification clause was added to the bidding document. The result was
that a lot of time was wasted later. Public bidding opened in April 1993 and bids were submitted
in July 1993. The bid evaluation report was addressed to the Bank in September 1993. The report
did not take into consideration the post-qualification criterion, and proposed a list of three firms to
negotiate an eventual contract, and not the designation of a winning firm. The discussion lasted
for months, and the contract was finally notified on September 26, 1994 some 15 months after
the submission of bids. It should be noted that the final value of the contract was much lower than
the original estimate (Table 7A).
23.   Final design and works supervision. This package was launched very quickly, but the
financial proposals had been opened at the same time as the technical offers, contrary to the
stipulations of the invitation letter and despite detailed discussions with a previous Bank mission.
By letter of October 19, 1993, the Bank asked SONELEC to cancel the process and launch a
new consultation. The result was a delay of six months.
24.   Rosso water supply study. IDA accepted to finance the drillings of Tenadi against AFD
financing of the Rosso study. As the AFD project was not done, the study was not carried out.
25.   Preparation of tender documents. This contract was signed directly with the consulting
firm which had carried out the feasibility and final design studies, and did not face any problem.
26.   Technical assistance, audits and miscellaneous snmall studies. Technical assistance
mainly concerned leak detection (para 16 above) and implementation of a cost accounting system.
The system was finalized in May 1997 and finally permitted, in a reliable manner, a separation of
the water and electricity accounts. The project also financed study to revalue SONELEC's assets.
The contract was effectively executed, but primarily for a physical inventory of the assets. The
study contained all the elements permitting a formal asset revaluation, but for reasons of
Mauritanian regulations, the revaluation was not reflected in SONELEC's accounts.

D. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
27.   Factors within the control of Government: Many procurement problems prevented the
project from being smoothly and timely implemented. SONELEC consistently refused to follow
the Bank's procedures in a transparent way: refusal to pre-select for the extension works (15
months' delay), failure to follow the procedures for appraisal of the study proposals, etc. Each
consultation gave way to the same recalls and the same discussions, and lengthy delays were
experienced in correspondence exchanges before the Bank could give its no objection. This cycle
of delays continued throughout the project and could have been sufficient grounds for suspension
threats, but this was not done. The situation was the same for the studies and technical assistance
procurement.
28.   A related cause of delays, often considerable, is the lengthy bureaucratic procedures for
procurement within Mauritania. SONELEC has its own procurement commission and the
evaluation of bids is relatively rapid, until the submission of a proposal to the Bank, after which, if
the contract is above UM 5 million (US$ 31,250), it must follow a complicated network of
clearances involving the Ministries of Hydraulic, Finance and Planning. The minimum delay is
two months, but can exceed 9 to 12 months (a contract for which IDA gave its no objection on
May 24, 1996 was still not signed end of May 1997). If SONELEC wants to be able to execute a
future donor-supported water sector project these controls must be streamlined with a view to
increasing efficiency.
E. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
29.   Sustainability is probable with respect to the cost accounting system, which SONELEC
has shown to be capable of using and maintaining. Sustainability of the physical works, however,
(which is the larger investment) is unlikely given the perceived lack of commitment to the project
on the part of the Borrower. The management cell Qf the distribution network which received
strengthening under the project was dissolved even before the end of project implementation.
F. BANK PERFORMANCE
30.   Project preparation was very long, from January 1986 to February 1992, largely because
of slow decision-taking by the Bank and Borrower given the uncertain political climate that
existed in Mauritania at the time. The appraisal was planned for July 1987, then July 1989 and
again Novemlber 1989. In October 1989, the Bank's management decided to drop the project from
the lending program in order to focus more on the country's structural adjustment efforts. It was
only in October 1991 that preparation started again seriously and continued quickly through to
appraisal in February 1992.
31.   Project supervision by the Bank appeared to be satisfactory. The frequency of missions
was adequate as was staff continuity: there were three missions in 1993 and 1995, and two per
year in 1994, 1996 and 1997. The more frequent missions in the early years were due to the fact
that the project had to be launched seriously in 1993, and the momentum had to be kept through
1995. In all, there were twelve supervision missions. Three task managers succeeded one another



7
over a period of six years, which is reasonable. During the last year a number of short technical
missions were carried out to help the Borrower implement the Action Plan concerning
disbursements. With respect to the supervision content, the project was rated S in implementation
progress through mid-1996, after which it was rated U, a status which remained unchanged till
project closing.
G. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
32.   Overall, the Borrower's performance was unsatisfactory. The Government contributed to
delays in project preparation by not following up in 1987, 'with the privatization proposals for
SONELEC (para. 1), which in hindsight would have been a rnore sustainable way to develop the
sector. The Government also failed to implement procurement procedures that could have enabled
a more satisfactory outcome. On the other hand, the Government did comply with the project's
requirement for semi-annual tariff increases.
33.   SONELEC's performance in the implementation of the project was deficient for the
following reasons: (i) unnecessary lengthy delays in the procurement process; (ii) failure to
comply in a timely manner with Bank's procedures for procurement; (iii) failure to meet all of the
objectives of the performance contract; (iv) delays in disconnecting the illegal connections for
irrigation (in 1996 instead of 1993); (v) delays in preparation of the component which should
have been financed by AFD and would have supplied Nouakchott from Tenadi; and (vi) by taking
the decision to drill four more wells at Idini it failed to implement the recommendations of the
hydrogeological studies financed by AFD and IDA.
34.   The project's accounts were audited each year by independent auditors accepted by IDA in
compliance with the Credit Agreement. The audit reports were regularly submitted to IDA,
though sometimes late.
H. ASSESSMENT OF PROJECT'S OUTCOME
35.   The project's outcome is unsatisfactory. The leak detection and repair program was
carried out though limited by the lack of appropriate equipment (para 16); the hydrogeological
study for Tenadi was carried out, though the study recommendations were not adhered to (para
10); the distribution network was repaired, but sustainability could not be assured because of the
lack of equipment and supporting materials; the team trained to carry out leak detection work was
disbanded; water supply could not be increased to the poor areas because of limited production
capacity and weak pressures; spare parts, materials and equipment for connections were procured,
though delayed by weak procurement procedures. Financial self-sufficiency was achieved through
high tariffs, but significant capital investment cannot be financed even at the current high tariffs.
I. FUTURE OPERATION
36.   Discussions were held with Government to reform water sector management to ensure
maintenance of project investments. The Government is working on a declaration of sector policy
but is not convinced that private participation in the water sector is the appropriate path to take in
the short termn. Further studies are being carried out, including a study to determine whether water
and electricity should be managed as one utility or whether the sector should be unbundled by
function.

J. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
37.   The absence of a coherent water sector policy at project design gave rise to a number of
key lessons.
Need for coherent sector development plan prior to investment: There must be
commitment to policy reform before an investment is undertaken. The apparent haste to
invest irrespective of the sector environment and Borrower commitment to reform
contributed to the project's weak outcome. The failure of the Borrower to buy-in to
needed sector reforms led to the myriad of implementation difficulties described above.
Another symptom of weak Borrower commitment was the apparent resistance to adopt
procurement procedures that would enable smooth project implementation. Even though
SONELEC staff were sent to Bank procurement courses, this proved insufficient.
Complex rules of Government and the country's bureaucratic environment were not
conducive to quick procurement decision-making. Country specific constraints remained
on how to deal with international goods and works which might have benefitted from
streamlining prior to project start. In retrospect, more input from a procurement specialist
during missions might have been helpful.
Need to critically assess management capacity: In order to create an enabling
environment for a project, it is crucial to carry out a sound capacity assessment of the
responsible institution(s). In cases where private sector participation is foreseen as the
best solution, up-front measures must be implemented towards that direction prior to
credit effectiveness or even prior to negotiations. In the present case, strengthening
SONELEC was first retained as an acceptable solution, but during implementation it
became obvious that SONELEC was unable to continue managing the sector and should
be reformed, including the establishment of an appropriate public-private partnership. The
fact that the government was not prepared to undergo major reform impaired attainment of
the project objectives.
*     Phase-out of technical assistance must be carefully planned: The project was launched
at a time of transition for SONELEC when expatriates who managed the sector for over 25
years were being replaced by local staff. The impact of this transition was not fully
assessed at appraisal and contributed to SONELEC's inability to adequately execute the
project. A more sustained way to assist a water and electricity utility could have been
through a partnership with a specialized private firm.
Project's objectives must be supported by targeted components: The objectives of the
project were not specifically supported by targeted components that would achieve
the objectives, and hence the design was deficient. For example, the investment
components were very limited in scope compared with the more ambitious development
objectives of the project.



9
Participation of other donors needs to be sealed very early in the project: There was
parallel financing arrangement in the project (with AFT)) which did not fully
materialize. The lesson from this experience suggests that a condition of effectiveness
should be that the Credit Agreements of other donors are put in place. Delays in entering
into negotiations between AFD and the Government in this project delayed the benefits
which could have accrued if AFD had implemented its component.
*     Financial equilibrium is at times a more appropriate goal than rate of return: Finally,
automatic tariff increases based on achieving a rate of return eliminate incentives for a
company to improve efficiency and reduce costs. In the case of Mauritania, the tariff was
increased semi-annually as required by the project, but this was not matched by cost
reductions and did not lead to efficiency improvements. Tariff adjustments should be
based on reaching medium to long term sector financiail equilibrium rather than a target
rate of return which is usually based on value of fixed assets which is at times unreliable.
38.   A future Bank-financed operation in the sector shoulcl take account of the above lessons,
particularly with respect to the need for sequencing sector policy reform and investment programs.

REPUBLIQUE ISLAMIQUE DE MAURITANIE
Projet d'Approvisionnement en Eau (Cr 2389-MAU)
Mission IDA d'achevement du Projet, du 8 au 15 et du 26 au 28 Fevrier 1998
AIDE-MEMOIRE
1.    Une mission de l'Association Internationale de Developpement (IDA) conduite conjointement par
MM. Jan Janssens et Matar Fall, Ingenieurs Sanitaires, Claude Sorel, Specialiste du Developpement du
Secteur Prive, Mme Fanny Barrett, Assistante de Programmes, et Gerard Tenaille, Consultant, a sejourn
en Mauritanie du 8 au 15 et du 26 au 28 fevrier 1998 pour clore le Projet d'Approvisionnement en Eau
(Cr6dit 2389-MAU), et preparer le rapport d'achevement (ICR). Cette mission a egalement beneficie d'un
appui precieux de la Mission Residente de la Banque Mondiale a Nouakchott. Cette mission constitue la
demiere mission de supervision du projet, dont la cl6ture est fix6e au 28 fevrier 1998.
2.    La Mission a e  recue en audience par S.E. Sidi El Moktar Ould Naji, Ministre du Plan et S. E.
Mohamed Salem Ould Merzoug, Ministre de l'Hydraulique et de i'Energie. Elle a egalement rencontre les
principaux responsables de la SONELEC, dont la liste figure en annexe 1 du pr6sent aide-memoire. La
Mission tient a remercier les Autorites mauritaniennes et la Direction de la SONELEC pour leur accueil et
leur collaboration. Enfin, la Mission s'est entretenue avec les representants de la Caisse Fran,aise de
Developpement (CFD) presents a Nouakchott (CFD).
3.    Les conclusions du present Aide-memoire seront confinnees par lettre separee de l'IDA.
Taux de decaissement du Credit 2389-MAU
4.     A deux semaines de la date de cl6ture du Credit, les decaissements se montent seulement A 62,2%
du montant du Credit. Toutefois trois livraisons de mateiels viennent d'etre receptionnees. La mission a
e informee par la SONELEC que les demandes de paiement ont e transmises a la Banque mondiale.
Materiels de r6seau et de branchements: TROUVAY & CAUVIN, 3.276.416 FF;
Fourniture de matNriels informatiques: High Tech, 103.000 US$;
Materiels d 'exploitation: BORANEX, 1.508.400 FF.
Les materiels etant livres, on peut considerer qu'ils pourront etre financ6s par le Credit, ce qui portera le
taux de decaissements a 71,6%.
Audit de gestion de la SONELEC pour l'annee 1996
5.    La Mission a etd informne par la Direction Financiere et du Contr6le de Gestion que le rapport
final de I'audit de gestion du cabinet KPMG pour l'annee 1996, finance par la CFD, leur serait
communique le 28 f6vrier 1998 au plus tard. L'audit de gestion de F'annee 1997 par le meme cabinet va
commencer fin fevrier 1998, en meme temps que l'audit des comptes. II est rappele que le cabinet KPMG a
recu mandat suIr financement CFD de realiser l'audit annuel de gestion de la SONELEC pour les trois
annees 1996, 1997 et 1998.



27
ReWOement par l'Etat de ses factures d'eau et d'electricite.
6.     Conformement a la recommandation faite au cours de ses visites de mai-juin et de novembre-
decembre 1997, la Mission reitere le souhait que soient inscrites au budget de l'Etat les sommes
correspondant aux depenses reelles de consommation d'eau et d'electricite de l'Administration et des
etablissements cautionn6s. Une budg&tisation realiste des depenses d'eau et d'1elctricite eviterait
l'accumulation par la SONELEC de creances impayees sur l'Etat et le recours p6riodique a la
compensation des dettes croisees entre l'Etat et la SONELEC. Les sommes inscrites au budget de l'Etat
pour l'annee 1998 au titre des consommations d'eau et d'electricit6 par l'Administration et les
etablissements cautionnes s'elevent a environ 700 millions UM alors que les depenses de consommation
d'eau et d'electricite sont estimees a 1 200 millions UM, soit une difference de 500 millions UM. La
Mission exprime de nouveau sa preoccupation sur le manque de transparence d'une telle pratique et le
risque qu'elle peut entraenor sur l1'quilibre financier du secteur, meme si la mission reconnait que ce
mecanisme de reglement par compensation est prevu dans le contrat-programme.
Reduction des consommations d'eau et d'electricite de I'Administration
7.     Comnime elle l'a deja 6voqu6 dans les visites precedentes, la Mission recommande qu'une camnpagne
volontariste soit lancee par le Gouvernement pour r6duire les consommations d'eau et d'electricite de l'Etat
et des etablissements cautionnes. Une telle campagne doit faire partie int6grante de toute reforme
institutionnelle du secteur.
Manuel de procddures comMtables
8.    La Mission a recu communication du nouveau manuel ole procedures comptables elabore par la
DFC apres un stage d'etude finance par l'IDA. Le manuel n'appelle pas d'observations particulieres de la
part de la Mission.
ModNle financier des sous-secteurs de 1'eau et de l'electricite
9.     La Mission a recu communication de deux nouvelles series de projections financieres (deux
scenarios) des sous-secteurs de l'electricite et de l'eau portant sur la periode 1998-20 10. Les hypotheses de
base des deux nouveaux sc6narios sont les memes, sauf pour ce qui concerne les taux de rendement de
l'electricite et de l'eau. Le premier scenario reflete une amelioration lente des taux de rendement de
l'electricite et de l'eau pendant la periode. Le second scenario suppose une amelioration drastique de ces
taux de rendement en 1998, suivie d'une tres Ilg&re amelioration ensuite. La Mission a emis des doutes sur
le realisme du second scenario qui se fonde sur une extrapolation optimiste des premiers resultats
encourageants d'une campagne de recherche des fuites entawne en 1997. En l'absence d'un plan
d'investissement a long terme du sous-secteur de l'eau, et en accord avec la Banque, la Direction
Financiere de la SONELEC n'a tenu compte que des projets eau en cours de realisation. Pour ce qui
concerne le sous-secteur de l'electricite, les projections financieres tiennent compte de la mise en production
du barrage de Manantali a partir de l'annee 2004.
Proiection de la demande solvable
10.    La Mission a recu communication des projections de ventes d'eau a l'horizon 2010, en particulier
les projections utilisees par le cabinet SEURECA dans son etude de l'utilisation des ressources souterraines
: I'hypothese basse decoulant de l'etude SAFEGE et I'hypothese haute etablie a la demande de la
SONELEC, et les projections retenues par la DFC pour ses projections financieres (Annexe 2). Elle note la



28
coherence des projections SEURECA-SAFEGE avec les projections de la DFC. Par exemple, les
projections SEURECA-SAFEGE prevoient une vente d'eau de 21,4millions de m3 en 2010 contre
21,3 millions de m3 dans les projections DFC pour la meme annee. En revanche, les projections
SEURECA-SONELEC pr&voient une vente de 40,3 millions de m3 en 2010, ce qui semble peu realiste car
les depenses de consommation d'eau representeraient alors 1,69% du PIB, soit plus du double du ratio de
0,8% du PIB generalement constate dans l'ensemble des pays, industrialises comme en voie de
developpement. II est important de cerner avec precision les besoins futurs en eau potable, parce que les
previsions des besoins en eau ont des cons&quences considerables sur le montant des investissements a
realiser.
Rapport Final d'Execution (Contribution SONELEC)
11.   Au cours de son sejour a Nouakchott, la Mission a reu copie du Rapport Final d'Execution
prepare par la SONELEC.  Cette contribution importante a ete discutee avec les responsables du
departement Projets et Ingenierie, qui y apporteront quelques modifications. De son c6te, la mission
utilisera les chiffres de la DPI pour completer les annexes du Rapport d'Achevement.
Satisfaction des Obiectifs du Proiet
12.    La plupart des objectifs du projet n'ont ete atteints que partiellement:
(a)    De par ses composantes, ce Projet a un caractere intermediaire car il s'integre dans le cadre d'un
programme d'investissement comprenant la realisation d'un ensemble d'ouvrages et d'installations
necessaires a l'extension et au renforcement du systeme de production et de transport d'eau potable
notamment. A ce titre la realisation des objectifs prescrits pour les composantes financees par le Credit
IDA ne peut-etre que partielle car elle demeure tributaire des autres infrastructures dont le financement est
pressenti aupres des autres bailleurs de fonds (CFD, BAD, BEI, Gouvemement Chinois, etc..). L'effet
escompte sur l'alimentation en eau potable reste limite car les extensions de reseaux finances dans le cadre
du Projet ne seront pleinement optimisees qu'avec l'augmentation de la production prevue grace a la
r-alisation du Projet CFD (Extension du champ captant de Tenadi) dont l'execution a e  decalee en raison
des necessites du cadrage de ces investissements avec le nouveau projet d'AEP de Nouakchott a partir de
l'Aftout Es Saheli. Quant a l'allegement de la pauvrete, la mission considere que le prix du m3 d'eau en
Mauritanie est toujours tres eleve, de plus, le prix de revente de l'eau par les aniers atteint parfois des
niveaux plus de dix fois plus eleve que le tarif moyen de la SONELEC.
(b)    L'autosuffisance financiere du sous-secteur urbain de l'eau potable peut etre consideree comme
atteinte. Sur financement du cr6dit, la SONELEC a ameliore son systeme de comptabilite analytique qui
lui permet de maniere significative d'ameliorer sa connaissance de ses cofits d'exploitation. Ceci vient
d'etre complete par l'elaboration d'un manuel des procedures comptables. Dans le cadre des contrat-
programmes la SONELEC a beneficie d'augmentation de capital et d'une exoneration totale de taxes
(hydrocarbures, equipements destines a l'exploitation). De plus, les tarifs eleves pesent sur l'economie du
pays. C'est une consequence des augmentations automatiques de tarif, stipulees dans l'accord de credit, ce
qui reduit la motivation de l'entreprise a rechercher de facon plus rigoureuse l'exploitation au moindre
coat.
(c)    L'amelioration de la gestion du secteur par le renforcement de la SONELEC, de ses departements
technique et administratif et de ses proc6dures d'exploitation doit encore etre poursuivie. En effet, la mise
en oeuvre du Projet a mis en evidence les difficultes de la SONELEC d'executer les travaux dans les delais
prescrits. Malgre une prolongation de sept mois, trois millions de dollars n'auront pu 8tre decaisses. La
SONELEC n'est pas seule responsable de ces retards, qui sont dus en grande partie a ila lourdeur des



29
approbations et contr8les imposes du c8te Mauritanien. Pour un fiitar projet, il serait indispensable que ces
contr6les soient alleges et que, dans une reforme institutionnelle des secteurs eau et electricite, une plus
grande autonomie en la matiere soit inclue.
Concernant l'exploitation, les resultats sont satisfaisants: le rendement a baisse depuis 1994, avec
neanmoins une remontee en 1997; le nombre de branchements par employe a augment6; les arri6res clients
prives a ete ramene a 2,3 mois de facturation (contre un objectif de 2 mois); la dette par rapport aux
capitaux propres a diminue et le taux de rentabilite a e de 4% en 1996 et 1997, contre un objectif de 3%.
(d)    L'objectif d'ameliorer la gestion des eaux souterraines, par la protection et l'extention de la dur6e
de vie de la seule source d'eau souterraine existante de Nouakchott n'a pas ete atteint et doit 8tre respecte.
La cellule de surveillance du champ captant d'Idini dont la creation est une condition suspensive du
nouveau credit CFD n'est toujours pas en place et le contrat d'appui a cette cellule n'est pas encore signe.
Toutefois la mission a e  informee par la SONELEC que la mise en place de cette cellule est en cours et
sera effective avant la mi-mars 1998. Par ailleurs, des etudes hydrogeologiques du champ de Tenadi ont
e  realisees de 1993 a 1995, par le BRGM-ANTEA, et ses recommandations ont e  revues par le meme
bureau en 1997 sur demande la SONELEC et sur financement CFD. Dans cette nouvelle etude, le
consultant a repris les conclusions de son rapport de 1995 en les modifiant pour tenir compte d'une
nouvelle approche dans l'approvisionnement de la ville de Nouakchott et l'utilisation de la nappe du Trarza
pour les 20 prochaines ann6es. Le scenario retenu par la SONELEC dit scenario Idini extension tient
compte de la decision de la SONELEC d'assurer a breve dchdance la majeure partie de l'alimentation de
Nouakchott a partir du fleuve Senegal et de minimiser les investissements a Idini-Tenadi. La mission
exprime sa preoccupation que cette solution ne preserve pas la nappe autant que d'autres scenanios
repoussant les nouveaux forages a Tenadi.
Performance de la SONELEC
13.   La perfornance de la SONELEC dans la mise en oeuvre du projet a e  moyenne, pour les raisons
suivantes:
-      hesitations et retards dans le passation des marches, causes en partie par la lourdeur des
procedures nationales;
-      respect partiel des objectifs du second Contrat-Programme;
-      hesitations a dbconnecter les branchements clandestins des rmaraichers (prevu en 1993,   realise
en 1996)
decalage dans la preparation du Projet Tenadi qui devrait etre finance par CFD.
Par contre, il faut noter que la SONELEC a pu, grace au credit, ameliorer son systeme de comptabilite
analytique qui lui donne une meilleure connaissance de ses couts d'exploitation.
C18ture du Credit 2389-MAU
14.   En Juin 1997, l'IDA a accepte de reporter au 28 Fevrier 1998 la date de cl6ture du Credit 2389-
MAU, initialement fixee au 30 Juin 1997. Par lettre No 0060/MP, en date du 31 Janvier 1998, le
Gouvemement Mauritanien a saisi l'IDA d'une requete de prorogaLtion du Credit au 31 Decembre 1998 et



30
de la reallocation d'une partie des fonds .disponibles au financement d'etudes preparatoires a la reforne des
secteurs de 1'eau et de 1'6nergie. La decision definitive sera prise avant le 28 Fevrier 1998.

SUMMARY OF BORROWER'S COMMENTS



34
1   EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
1.1 Groundwater Management
The activities involved in the groundwater management component were performed.
BRGM was contracted to carry out a CFD-financed hydrogeological study (the exploratory
drilling component being financed by the Credit).
This study made it possible to analyze the advance of the saline front as operations
progressed, and to make the necessary recommendations for development of the wellfield.
Table 4.1 summarizes the three scenarios that were developed, two of these being extreme,
while the third can be regarded as a compromise between the other two.
In scenario 1, simulations using the model indicate that continuing to operate the Idini field
at the same level of output would lead to salt water intrusion by the year 2012.
Scenario 3 shows that sizable reductions in the output from Idini would postpone this
outcome by more than eight years (until 2020).
Scenario 2 could serve as a starting point for developing an intermediate solution.
Similarly, BRGM prepared a preliminary study for a Master Plan for water resource
management in the Trarza area.
This study made it possible to identify all the activities and tools necessary for establishing
the Master Plan.
Table 4.1 .b shows all the activities planned in order to establish a management monitoring
system.
1.2 Network Rehabilitation and Extension
All activities involved in network rehabilitation and extension were virtually completed, as
follows:
-     The leak detection program was implemented by SAFEGE, the consultant
hired for the purpose.
The leak detection equipment was delivered on July 7, 1997, and the
training provided for under the contract was imparted on the supplier's
premises and at the site.

The hardware for preparing computerized cartography of the network has
arrived in Nouakchott, and the acceptance process is under way.
Two separate contracts were issued for procurement of the equipment for
rehabilitating the existing areas of the network, package No. 1 (network
equipment) being awarded to Trouvay & Cauvin and package No.2
(connection equipment) to Boranex.
The network extension works have been completed and accepted.
This aspect of the project was delayed overall because the supplies
procurement process was slow.
1.3 Studies and Audits
The studies and audits component was completed by the preparation of the financial studies
and audit for FY94 and FY95.
Overall, the objectives of the project were achieved, and the main advantages to be derived
from it can be summarized as follows:
Network density and the service coverage rate were increased.
The total length of the Nouakchott network was originally 350 km, but it
has now been extended by about 85 krn, i.e. 25%.
The pipe installation made it possible to provide most of the connections
planned for poorer areas where water supply had previously been
inadequate, particularly in the northeast of the city.
The most underprivileged communities were provided with access to
drinking water by the installation of 1,100 low-cost connections and 15
standpipes.
By the time the works had been completed, most of the population in the
northeast of the city had been provided with a water supply (through either
individual connections or standpipes). This population totals 151,000
inhabitants, whereas previously only about 63,000 of the inhabitants had
had access to connections or standpipes.
Therefore, drinking water needed to be supplied to 88,000 people. The
SAFEGE study indicates that a "kiosk"-type standpipe with 10 faucets can
supply 3,500 people.



36
Consequently, the 15 standpipes installed under the project provide a
supply sufficient for 52,000 people, while the rest obtain water through
their own house connections or from neighbors.
Network performance was to be improved through the identification for
rehabilitation of sections of the system that were either dilapidated or
subject to frequent leaks.
The first thing shown by the figures for work performed on the system is
the large number of leak repairs carried out on Sebkha-EI Mina
connections (74% of operations), compared with pipe repairs (24%). That
is why network and connection rehabilitation has been planned for these
Moughataat (districts), with supply contracts issued to Trouvay & Cauvin
and Boranex (see 4.2 above). The works will be executed by SONELEC.
The technical management resources for SONELEC's networks were
strengthened.
The strengthening consisted of the installation of management software for
the water-supply system and procurement of operating and works
equipment. The cartographical hardware has arrived in Nouakchott and is
soon to be installed, while the contract for works equipment was awarded
to Hydrosphere, although the latter has just withdrawn from the agreement.
Nevertheless, a few difficulties remain:
Although the network was extended, there was not a corresponding
increase in output.  The operation of the network is therefore still
unbalanced, because it never reaches full capacity.
The results of the leak detection program were unsatisfactory, because of
this same problem of low network pressure.
Procurement procedures are quite slow (especially in the case of supplies),
and this has led to complete slippage in planning.
2. PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED
2.1 Monitoring and Supervision
-     The amount of piping that it was originally planned to use in the project
was considerably exceeded (by about 15 km).



37
When the works were undertaken, it became evident that the network
would have to be extended much more than planned, if actual demand was
to be met.
Despite the considerable efforts made to increase the density of the
network, the partial lengths used for the connections remained quite long.
The 32 km of HDPE piping earmarked for the installation of 1,637
connections proved sufficient only for 817; i.e. each connection required an
average of 40 m, double the length specified in the contract.
The contract had allowed for price adjustments and revision.
Calculation of the parameters was very approximate, because there is no
agency at national level that publishes data on the trends in the local
indexes.
Bids had to be delivered in July 1993, even though the award of the works
contract was not notified until September 1994.
The long delay in works start-up had a negative impact on the project.
The contractor submitted an application for price adjustment and
compensation.
The supervision mission had to extend its work by four and a half months
in order to complete the project.
Supplies:
Procurement for all supply components was considerably delayed.
As a result, the database and manage:ment software that had already been
prepared in 1995 could not be installed because the hardware was not
available. This delayed the preparation and issuance of the bidding
documents for rehabilitation contracts.
The leak detection program was completed in March 1996, even though
the necessary equipment has not yet been delivered. (Borrowed equipment
was used.)
Bids for the works equipment package were evaluated in February 1996,
but the award was not notified tntil July 1997.  The contractor's
withdrawal from this contract is partly the result of changes in prices and
the type of equipment proposed.



38
2.2 Financial Aspects
The main financial problem has been delays in disbursements.
Such delays are the result of the slow processing of bills, and the considerable time overruns
were caused by the use at that time of documentary letters of credit for dealing with supply
contracts.
In fact, 80% of payments to the supplier were made without notification to the SONELEC
unit responsible for monitoring contracts. As a consequence, the bills that the supplier would
normally be required to present so that such payments could be properly made were not submitted
on time. The reminders sent to the supplier are attached to this report.
2.3  Institutional Issues
When the project was implemented, it became evident that a major obstacle to the project's
progress was the dispersal of monitoring functions among a number of organizationally
independent bodies.
In addition, SONELEC should be vested with sufficient power of decision to bring to
closure any action already approved by the Investment Contract Committee (Commission des
Marches d 'Investissements).
3. PROPOSALS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE FUTURE
We offer the following recommendations for facilitating the implementation of future
projects:
(1)   SONELEC should be granted considerable autonomy in the area of
procurement.
(2)   Before the start-up of any project, a permanent agency should be charged
with responsibility for all aspects of implementation.
Involving a large number of different agencies in a single project makes
efficient monitoring difficult.
(3)   The agency responsible for project implementation should be given the
necessary human and logistical resources.
