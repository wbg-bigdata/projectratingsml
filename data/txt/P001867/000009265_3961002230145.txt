STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Credit and Project Summary
Boffower:           The Islamic Republic of Mauritania
Executing Agec:   Societe Nationale d'Eau et d'Electricite (SONELEC)
Credit Amount:      SDR 7.7 million (US$10.5 million equivalent)
Tenns:              Standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years
Onlending           as a loan to SONELEC at a 4 percent interest rate, repayable over 20 years
Irma:              inclueing 5 years grace
Proiect
Qkiectives:         The project is the first part of SONELEC's mid-term investment program in the
water sector. The project covers the most urgent rehabilitation and extension
works and lays the technical groundwork for the other works included in the
investment program. The project's main objectives are to secure a safe and
reliable water supply for Mauritania's urban centers while fostering an efficient
groundwater management and to protect and extend the finite life of Nouakchott's
only water source. It also aims at improving the population's standard of living,
promoting economic development through the provision of water supply
infrastructure, and at the same time reducing the sector's dependenc-y on the
Government budget. The Government's strategy is to improve the management
of the urban water supply subsector by entrusting it to a strong and financially
independent parastatal, 'SONELEC". The project's institution and capacity
building components aim at strengthening SONELEC's technical, financial and
managerial capability by achieving a financial discipline, improving billing and
collection operations, setting tariffs at an appropriate level to assure the
corporation's financial equilibrium, by optimizing the efficiency of its technical
installations, and by promoting water conservation and reducing wastage. The
Nouakchott water supply component will enable SONELEC to meet the demand
till the year 2000 and will enhance a more equitable distribution of the scarce
water, ease access for the poor to a piped water supply system, lift constraints
to urban development and prepare the grounds for sustained sector development.
In the sewerage subsector the project will strengthen SONELEC's capability to
operate and maintain the facilities, introduce cost recovery measures and help
plan for future development. It contributes to pollution control and prevents the
deterioration of the environment.
D2esrjgdo:          SONELEC's investment program is subdivided in five parts, the first four
zovering Nouakchott and the fifth covering the secondary centers:



ii
Part I:      Studies, network expansion and repairs
Part II:     Rehabilitation and construction of reservoirs
Part m:      Expansion of production system
Part IV:     Expansion of distribution system
Part V:      Water systems for secondary centers
The IDA project consists of a coherent set of actions, assembled as part I of this
investment program which are independent of the remainder of this plan. They
include the monitoring of the salt water intrusion in the existing Trarza aquifer
and a study to establish a groundwater management plan for the exploitation of
the new Tenadi wellfield, further from the advancing saline front. The project
also includes a program for leak detection, a repair and rehabilitation program
of the existing distribution network, upgrading of the existing installations, an
extension of the distribution system to the northern part of the town in order to
supply some of tne poorest parts of the population with water through privately
operated standpipes. Lastly the project includes studies and technical assistance
to prepare future parts of the program.
Justification:      The proposed project is justified by the universally recognized fact that the
provision of an adequate quantity of safe water is a basic necessity for the
maintenance of good health and productivity. This justification is enhanced by
the fact that the addii0onal inhabitants that wit! be served - approximately 60,000
through household connections and 100,000 thio-igh standpipes - belongs to the
poorest segments of Nouakchott's population. for these people, the project will
have a substantial poverty alleviation impact, not only through improvements in
their living conditions, but also by substantially retucing the price that they pay
for water (water vendor rates can be ten times or more the SONELEC tariff).
In addition, the provision of adequate infrastructure, including water supply, is
a prerequisite for economic development. In particular, the supply of water to
the capital city of Nouakchott, will lift constraints on urban development. The
project will also improve the efficient allocation of a rare national resource,
"water" and it will promote water conservation and reduce wastage. Moreover,
if the project would not be realized by 1996, according to groundwater experts,
salt water intrusion could permanently damage the Trarza aquifer and
substantially reduce the future water resources available for Nouakchott. Thus
the project will contribute to averting a major environmental problem. Lastly,
the project has enhanced donor coordination as a result of close cooperation with
prospective cofinanciers during preparation. Therefore the project makes an
effective contribution toward the development process in Mauritania.
RiskA:              The risk of not implementing the physical components of the project within the
set time frame is small. SONELEC has demonstrated that it is capable of
implementing similar size investment projects. Additionally, SONELEC will be
assisted by consultants in project design and supervision, and technical assistance
will be provided to strengthen its project management capacity. However, the
risk of not achieving the institutional and financial objectives within the set time
frame is not negligible. The precarious economic and tight financial situation of



iii
the countzy will make the reappearance of arrears to SONELEC possible,
notwithstanding Government assurances that future payments will be made within
legal time limits. The impact of this risk is minimized by covenants allowing the
Association to suspend disbursements in case payments are more than 90 days in
arrears. Equally, tariff increases are unpopular measures for the Government to
take; the introduction of automatic semi-annual tariff increases supported by
appropriate covenants will encourage the Government to honor its commitment.
Estimated Project Cos
The project is the first part of SONELEC's mid term investment program for the water supply sector. The
total project cost is estimated at UM 1102 million (US$13.8 million) as detailed in the following tW ', and
expressed in April 1992 prices. (Ihe estimated cost of the whole investment program is UM 7811 million
(US$ 97.64 million)).

MAURlrANIA
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE WATER SUPPLY. ELECTRICITY AND SANITATION SECTgR
Geograhy. Climate. Population and Economy
1.1          Mauritania, a nation located in northwest Africa, is a bridge between Arab Africa to
the north and sub-Saharan Africa to the south. Two distinct regions are apparent in the country. The
northern region covers two-thirds of the land and is part of the Sahara. Its terrain consists of sand
dunes and rocky plateaus, with altitudes ranging from approximately 450 m in the north to about 180
m in the south. The smaller southern region is composed of the Sahel and the northern portion of
the Senegal River valley, known locally as the Chemama. The overage altitude in this region is about
91 m. Except for a few oases in the desert, the alluvial riviar valley soils provide the country's only
arable land. Mauritania's rivers, all tributaries of the Senegal River, are located in the southwestern
part of the country (see map in Annex 1).
1.2          Daytime temperatures in the desert are usually above 380C (100lF) for the six hottest
months of the year, whereas in the cooler season the daytime desert temperature is about 24°C (750F).
Rainfall in the desert is undependable and totals less than 100 mm (4 in) in a year. In Nouakchott,
the capital, temperatures reach about 45C in the warmest month and average about 180C in the
coolest month. The rainfall in Nouakchou totals approximately 150 mm a year. At Selibaby in the
extreme south, temperatures range from 290C in the warmest month te 200C in the coolest month.
Rainfall there averages approximately 635 mm a year.
1.3          Rapid growth, low density and rapid sedentarization characterize Mauritania's
demographics. The population is estimated at 2 million (in 1991) with 1 million in 24 urban centers
of over 5,000 inhabitants. The remaining population is partly nomad (175,000 inhabitants) and partly
rural sedentary (825,000 inhabitants) living in 3,600 villages having less than 1,000 people each,
mostly located in the Senegal River Basin. The annual population growth is estimated at 2.9 percent.
The average population density is the lowest in Western Africa. The largest urban centers are
Nouakchott, the capital (550,000 inhabitants), Nouadhibou, the industrial capital (60,000 inhabitants),
Kaedi (40,000 inhabitants) and Akjoujt, Atar, Kiffa, Rosso, and Zouerate with more than 30,000
people each. Nouakchott is growing at 11 percent per annum.
1.4          The pressures of intermittent severe drought and growth of a modern sector based on
mineral exports have resulted in dramatic shifts in the distribution of population and the way of life
of most Mauritanians. Mauritania's explosive urbanization is the combined result of ecological social
change pressures, conditions of economic development and the severe droughts that the country has
experienced. Whereas in 1965 an estimated 83 percent of the population led a nomadic or semi-
nomadic way of life, based on raising livestock, it is estimated that only 10 percent of the population
are presently nomadic, with the rest raising crops or living in towns. The largest part of this
demographic shift has been towards the urban centers. More than half of the urban population lives
in Nouakchott with a large proportion of this total boused in tents around the city.



2
1.5          The squatter settlements (kdb6s) are characterized by very low quality housing (mostly
shacks and tents) located in the desert surrnunding Nouakchott, and lack of water supply, sanitation
and garbage disposal facilities. When it is available, water is purchased at very high prices under
unsanitary conditions from water vendors who transport it in drums on donkey carts. Recent sur"eys
show that access to water among the pepulation of Nouakchott in fact decreased from 53 percent to
30 percent during the period 1986-91.
1.6          Mauritania's economy is based on a traditional rural sector (essentially livestock
raising) and a significant industrial sector (essentially mining and fish processing). The country
depends almost totally on exports of iron ore, `h, and fish products for foreign exchange earnings.
1.7          The modem sector of the economy is dominated by iron mining (nationalized in 1974)
and the rapidly grvwing fishing industry, which provide nearly all export earnings. High-grade iron-
ore deposits at Fder;k, in the Sahara, constitute the country's principal resource. Copper is found
at Akjoujt. Ihe coastal waters abound in fish. Subsistence agriculture and livestock raising are
pursued by some 60 percent of the population. Setded farming is confined to the Chemama and the
oases. Dams along the Senegal River are increasing the amount of arable land. The principal crops
are millet, sorghum, peanuts, rice, sugarcane, and dates. Before the Sahel drought of 1969-74,
Mauritania's farmers grew enough grain to feed the country; by the mid-1950's, however, most
foodstuffs hv i to be imported. Due to drought and overgrazing, the desert is moving southward
approximately 6.5 km per year. Efforts to restore pasture land by digging wells and stabilizing dunes
have met with little success. The country is heavily dependent on food imports and foreign aid.
1.8          Of the urban population approximately 18 percent has direct access to cltean piped
water and the remaining 82 percent obtain ther water from public standpipes or water vendors who
resell water purchased from privatized standpipes. In rural areas, only about 39 percent of the
population has access to a safe and reliable water supply. The service levels for sewerage disposal
are considerably lower; only about 4 percent of the urban dwellers in Nouakchott are hooked up to
a water-borne sewerage system; the remainder rely on pit latrines, septic tanks or have no disposal
system at all.
1.9          The inadequate availability of safe water and sanitation facilities contribute to a high
rate of disease among the population. Among the four leading diseases in Mauritania, three are
water-related, i.e., diarrhea, conjunctivitis, and dysentery. These health problems are particularly
severe in the periphery settlements of Nouakchott. During a recent health survey conducted in a
representative periphery neighborhood, one fourth of the infants under the age of five were suffering
from diarrhea. The presence of cholera in Nouakchott and the existing difficulty in controlling it in
the surrounc.!ng region is a potentes, problem to be noted. The provision of adequate quantities of
potable water will contribute sigr ..cantly to alleviating these problems and to improving the general
level of health in Nouakchott.
Water Resources and Legislation
1.10         The great majority of the population of Mauritania relies on fossil aquifers as their
source of potable water. However, since Nouakchott and Nouadhibou are located above saline
aquifers, water is extracted from wellfields east of the saltwater front and approximately 60 km from
the cities. Exploitation of the aquifer is resulting in the advance of the saltwater front necessitating
the construction of new boreholes at increasingly greater distances from the cities (see map Annex



3
2). The capacity of the aquife- is not known with certainty, but a recent study concluded that it is
sufficient to cover the needs for the foreseeable futture. T1he wa_.- is of excellent quality and does
not require any treatment other than disinfection by chlorination. Other urban centers such as Atar,
Kiffa, etc., are not situated on or iaear large exploitable aquifers and therefore have insufficient water
resources available. The only major urban center being serviced by surface water is Rosso.
1.11         Nouakchott is characterized by the absence of any economically feasible water source
other than the wellfields in the Trarza aquifer, and by a critical lack of pressure in the entire
distribution network. A suppliers' market has developed with the organization of a complex system
of water vendors supplying the urban population not serviced by domestic connections. Due to the
limited number of communal water distribution points, and the long travel distances to these points,
households are supplied by private water vendors with bulk quantities of water (200 liter barrel&)
transported on donkey carts. Unconnected customers, and conr   1 cc. -amers suffering from a
frequent lack of suwficient water pressure, have often dug undergr.L.. -isterr, to store water. The
commune of Nouakchott provides a ver- limited volume of free water via ,ater trucks to some of
the poorest of the squatter settlements on the periphery of the city.
Water and Sanitation Sector Organization
1.12         Responsibility for the water and sanitation sector in Mauritania is presently divided
among four government Ministries, with a future expansion of the role of the local governments
planned. The Ministbre de l'Hydraulique et de l'Energie (MHE) is responsible for establishing the
national water policy, the preparation and enforcement of water management regulations, hydraulic
'.udies, planning and protection measures, and has overall responsibility for water production and
distribution in the rural and urban sectors. The MHE has the responsibility for supervising the
operations of SONELEC who operate the water production and distribution systems of Nouakchott,
Nouadhibou, Rosso, Kaedi, Mederdra, and other secondary centers. The Ministere de la Sante (MS),
through the Service d'Hygibne et d'Assainissement, is responsible for the planning and
implementation of wastewater and solid waste disposal programs, and the preparation and
enforcement of sanitation regulations. Another service of the MS, the Centre National d'Hygiene,
operates a laboratory to monitor water quality throughout the country, and to carry out public health
research projects. The Ministbre du Developpement Rural is responsible for rural water resource
matters related to agriculture, livestock, rural engineering, and the protection of soil, vegetation, and
wildlife. The development of local government structures hegan in 1986 and it is anticipated by the
national government that they will play an increasingly impor ant role in the management and
operation of local water supply and distribution systems.
Government Sector Po1;ey. Priorities and Objectives
1.13         The financl' difficulties that have faced Mauritaia during the past few years have
led the Government to redefine its sector strategy and objectives. The water and sanitation sector in
Mauritania is hampered by manpower constraints which result in deficient maintenance, weak
wellfield management practices, premature degradation of existing facilities, a bacldog of expansion,
and poor levels of service. The Govermnent's sector policy is now to provide I able water and
adequate sanitation facilities as quickly as possible to all urban and agglomerated rural populations
and, at the same time, reduce the financial dependency of the water sector on Government subsidies.
The strategy to achieve tFese objectives is to strengthen the sector institutions in order to enable them
to efficiently manage the sector, including the coordination cf foreign aid, and achieve the financial



4
independence of the sector through the introduction of cost recovery principles. A statement of sector
policy is included in the project file.
1.14         The Urban MWater Suply Subsector.  The urban water supply subsector is
charactaerized by low service levels, high urban growth, significant dependence on foreign or
government financial support, shortage of qualified manpower, inadequate maintenance and operation
practices, weak sector institutions, and poor sanitary conditions in urban conglomerations. The
Government's primary objectives are to vntisfy the total urban water demand by the year 2000
through private connections and privately operated standpipes, with priority being given to the cities
of Nouakchott and Nouad;iibou. Secondary objectives in the urban wa:er subsector are to: (1) equip
each community having a population of 5,000 or more inhabitants with a water supply system
designed to deliver a minimum of 40 liters per inhabitant per day; (2) encourage privatization of the
conmmunal standpipes so that the total cost of water is borne by the ben eficiaries; (3) extend the water
distribution systems and establish a system of tariffs that will increase the access to water by the
poorest sections of the population, and (4) pass on to SONELEC  '-- responsibility for managing
those operations which are financially viable but where the complexity of the system is greater than
the capabilities of the local administration to manage.
1.15         'Me Rural Water Supply Subsector. The Government's objective is to promote local
initiatives and management of water supply operations, and promote cost recovery systems which will
ensure proper operation and maintenance in the short run and total financial independence (including
the recovery of investment costs) in the long run. The government proposes to restructure its own
Ministry for Hydraulics and Energy so as to decentralize to the regional offices the implementation
and management of water supply programs, and to withdraw gradually from the construction of water
supply systems and leave this task to the private sector.
1.16         The Sanitation Subsector. The sanitation subsector is characterized by a lack of
resources to carry out sanitation projects, and confusion among the various institutions involved as
to their respective responsibilities. The operation and maintenance of the only operating sewerage
system in the country (Nouakchott) is the responsibility of SONELEC. SONELEC receives no
remuneration for this service. The most critical sanitation situation presently exists in Nouakchott
due to the failure of the existing sewage collection and treatment system, and the rapid uncontrolled
urban growth taking place. In Nouakchott only the downtown core, consisting of approximately 4
percent of the city's population, is serviced by the sewei ge system. The sewage treatment plant for
this system will be rehabilitated by the end of 1992 with the help of financing from the African
Development Bank. The collection system itself requires re' ^bilitation but funding for this has not
yet been secured. The rest of the population of Nouakchott, and other centers, are serviced by
individual systems (pit latrines, cesspools, septic tanks), or have no disposal system at all. Given the
soil and saline groundwater underlying the city, these individual systems are perfectly satisfactory.
The governent's objectives in the sanitation subsector are to: (a) clarify clearly the roles of all the
institutions implicated in the sector, (b) prepare master plans for, and assure a suitable level of
wastewater and solid waste disposal service for the large urban centers, and (c) systematically
integrate a sanitation component into all future rural water projects.
1.17         The Electricity Supply Subsector  The objectives of the Government are to: (1)
assure the financial equilibrium of SONELEC by maintaining a rigorous monitoring of the application
of the contrat-programme especially in the area of billing and collection; (2) improve the quality and



availability of the distribution of electricity; and (3) to improve the coverage of the population in the
centers that have electricity available.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
1.18         The water supply sector in Mauritania remains grossly underdeveloped. Investments
have lagged behind urban growth and coverage is inadequate. Because properly functioning
infrastrueture is essential for Ole alleviation of the condition of object poverty that characterize most
of the peripheral neighborhoods of Nouakchott and is also one of the prerequisites for economic
advancement, the developme it of an adequate and efficiently run water and electricity utility is crucial
for the growth of Mauritana. IDA's cataliltic involvement has been and will be instrumental in
assisting the Government a;id donors to impllement appropriate sector development strategies. It
should also be effective in mobilizing additional external resources. The high priority given by the
Government to this project, as evidenced by the initiatives already undertaken under the Public
Enterprise Technical Assistance and Rehabilitation Project, is a reflection of Government's strong
commitment to institute sound management pr: ciples and concepts.
Bank/Countr Goals. Role and Sector Lending Strategy
1.19         The main objectives of IDA's involvement in the water sector are to improve the
living conditions of Mauritania's urban poor through improvements in living conditions and
reductions in the price of water and to restructure the responsibilities of the sector institutions in order
to improve planning, investment decisions, financial discipline and management, and the efficiency
of operations. A continuing dialogue between the Government, IDA, and other donors on
institutional reforms and sector organization took place during the 1980s, resulting in the Bank Group
involvement in several projects. The Public Enterprise Technical Assistance and Rehabilitation
Project (Cr. 1567-MAU) represented IDA's first participation in the water supply sector in
Mauritania. This project provided the basis for enhancing IDA's understanding of the sector and for
developing the local institutional capability to manage the rehabilitation process. SONELEC also
benefitted from further technical assistance under the "Public Enterprise Sector Adjustment Program"
(Cr. 2166-MAU) and the "Public Enterprise Sector Institutional Development and Technical
Assistance Project" (Cr. 2167-MAU). ne proposed project includes additional technical assistance
and consulting services to farther strengthen SONELEC and to improve management of the sector.

II. SECTOR INSTITUTIONS
2.1          Following the Government of Mauritania's request, the Bank began dealing with the
rehabilitation of SONELEC and other public enterprises in 1983. The situation that the Bank's
identification/appraisal mission found in October 1983 was a somber one. Statistics on production
and distribution were non-existent. Accounts were not kept with the result that no one knew how
much money was received or spent. In Nouakchott, only 1 diesel group was working out of 15 and
the availability of electricity was practically nil. The availability of water service was intermittent
with delivery of small amounts of water for only a f-w hours a day to some central quarters. The
peripheral quarters had no water at all and were supplied intermittently by trucks.
2.2          In the mid 1980's, Mauritania's Government, with the assistance of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank, undertook a series of measures to deal with the declining
economic and financial situation. In 1985, the Government initiated an Economic and Financial
Recovery Program (EFRP) with the objective of laying the foundations of durable growth and to re-
establish the equilibrium of public finances and the balance of payments. This adjustment program
included important reform initiatives specifically aimed at improving the performance of public
enterprises and encouraging private sector activity. These initiatives were supported by a Structural
Adjustment Credit (Cr. 1812 MAU), a Public Enterprise Technical Assistance and Rehabilitation
Project (Cr. 1567 MAU), a Public Enterprise Sector Adjustment Prograrn (Cr. 2166 MAU), and a
Public Enterprise Sector Institutional Development and Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 2167
MAU). Within the framework of these interventions, the rehabilitation of SONELEC has been
partially achieved. A performance contract was signed between the Government and SONELEC in
February 1989 that clarified their financial relationship especially with regard to the need for a capital
increase and Government's obligation to pay for water and electricity services. Notwithstanding the
notable efforts that have been made to date, there is still a need to sustain the rehabilitation process
and the proposed project aims to continue and enhance the reforms achieved to date.
The National Water & Electricity Authority (SONELEC)
2.3          Created in 1975, as a result of the nationalization of its French-owned predecessor,
MAURELEC, SONELEC provides water and electricity services to the country's main urban centers.
Water service is provided in ten centers, electricity in seven, and sewerage in three centers.
Nouakchott and Nouadhibou, the two largest cities, account for the bulk of SONELEC's operations.
SONELEC's Organization and Management
2.4          Originally created as an Entreprise Publique I Caractere Industriel et Commercial
(EPIC), SONELEC became a Societe Nationale in October 1990. This category of commercially
oriented companies is designed to give more autonomy to the entity. It has a Board of Directors,
consisting of eight members representing the principal ministries, the National Assembly, the
Presidency, and the union of workers. Clarification of the respective obligations and responsibilities
of SONELEC and Government was established through the preparation of the first "contrat-
programme' in 1989. This contrat-programme has been quite successful and was instrumental in
substantially improving SONELEC's performance. The contrat-programme expires in June 1992.
A new contrat-programme, taking into account the experience over the first three-year period, as well



7
as sector developments, e.g., in the sewerage subsector, has been approved by the Government and
will cover the period July 1992- June 1995. The Government is satisfied with the progress that has
been achieved over the last several years with regard to the improved financial and technical
performance c, SONELEC. It intends to continue this improvement through the continued use of
contrat-programmes. Since the process is showing very positive results, privatization, whose benefits
are uncertain, is not envisaged at this time.
2.5          Day-to-day management is vested in SONELEC's L rector General. The Director
General is appointed by the Council of Ministers on the recommendation of the Minister of
Hydraulics and Energy. The Director General has under his administration 7 departments: (1)
Finance and Accounting; (2) Commercial Activities; (3) Management Control; (4) Technical (Water);
(5) Technical (Electricity); (6) Studies and Development; and (7) Administration. The sewerage
division is under the Technical Department for Water. A reorganization of SONELEC was
implemented under the Public Enterprise Technical Assistance and Rehabilitation Project in order to
ease the burden on senior management and heighten the separation of functional responsibility
between water and electricity operations. SONELEC's Organization Chart is depicted in Annex 3.
Staffing and Personnel
2.6          At the end of 1991, SONELEC had 790 permanent staff of which 290 were assigned
to water and 440 to electricity. SONELEC has reduced the staff to 742 as of the end of April 1992.
Thereafter total personnel will be kept at a level to meet the efficiency objective of 68 electricity and
water meters per employee by the end of 1992 evolving to 95 meters per employee by July 1996 at
the expiration of the second contrat-programme.
Technical Assistance/Tra' n
2.7          IDA and the FAC are the main donors who provide technical assistance to
SONELEC. This technical assistance was considered the appropriate vehicle to address the desperate
situation that the utility was in. Over the period 1984 to 1991, SONELEC benefitted from
approximately 125 man/years of assistance, or on average the equivalent of about 15 technical
assistants per year. Technical assistance was provided at the management as well as at the technical
level (in accounting, customer management, computerization, etc.). The Director of Finance as well
as the Director of Commercial Operations (Technico-Commercial), who are currently carrying out
their duties efficiently and competently, are good examples of at least 6 Mauritanian counterparts who
benefitted from the technical assistance program. For all future technical assistance, SONELEC
intends to have in place suitably qualified Mauritanian counterparts. By the end of 1993, the plan
is to reduce by at least half, the amount of technical assistance provided. SONELEC also intends to
continue and strengthen its training program. This program would improve:
(a)   the development of technical and management skills through local and overseas
scminars and through exchange programs with European and African water
companies;
(b)    SONELEC's own in-house training department; and
(c)   intnal financial control and procedures by creating an analytical accounting system.



Although the project will not finance the training program, it will be important during supervision
to carry out an annual review of training;; -*' 4vements and plans.
Activity in Electriciq
2.8          SONELEC has the responsibility for the production and distribution of electricity in
the urban centers. With a relatively new 28 MW plant in Nouakchott financed by ADB and FADES,
there is ample capacity to meet the demand for electricity in the capital until 1996. For Nouadhibou
a 22 MW plant is in operation. An increasing part of its production is sold to SNIM (Societe
Nationale Industrielle et Minibre). The preferential rate for SAFA was abolished as of May 1992.
ActLy inWate
2.9          SONELEC is in charge of the production and distribution of water in all urban
centers. In 1991, SONELEC produced 12.2 million cubic meters of water, of which 8.5 were for
Nouakchott and 2.6 million m3 were for Nouadhibou and the rest for the ten secondary centers. In
Nouakchott, there are 68 public standpipes which are operated by private entrepreneurs. Privatization
of standpipes in other urban centers is in progress.
Activity in Sewerage
2.10         SONELEC is responsible for the operation of the three existing sewerage systems in
Nouakchott, Nouadhibou, and Zouerate. Presently, SONELEC is not remunerated for its services.
The agreement by Government to a management contract for the operation of the sewerage network
will be incorporated in the new contrat-programme. The assets for the sewerage network as well as
the debt service will be transferred to the Government by the end of 1992. SONELEC will be
remunerated by the Govermment for its expenses for operating and maintaining the network.
2.11         The major sector issues are (i) the country's precarious financial situation and the
ensuing non-payment for water consumed by Govermment and the municipalities and (ii)
Government's reluctance to implement the tariff increases stipulated in the on-going contrat-
programme. These issues endanger SONELEC's solvency. These elements are addressed in the new
contrat-programme (Annex 16) and are clearly addressed under the proposed project. The details of
the measures to be taken are elaborated upon in the section on financial analysis (chapter IV).

m. THE PROJECT
Project Genesi
3.1          The proposed credit is a Specific Investment Credit to finance, together with the
CCCE and SONELEC, a project consisting of a part of SONELEC's investment program. The
project also includes institutional and financial reforms to strengthen SONELEC. It is the result of
a continuing dialogue between the Government, SONELEC, IDA and other donors (CCCE, AfDB)
on the rehabilitation of public enterprises in the framework of the Public Enterprise Technical
Assistance and Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1567-MAU). This credit, in addition to general sector
reforms, financed US$19.67 million, made available by IDA, CCCE, FAC, FDF and EIB, towards
the strengthening of SONELEC. In particular, it financed (a) the purchase of spare parts, equipment,
materials and vehicles; (b) the upgrading of connections, distribution networks and generating
capacity; (c) emergency works for water and electricity production for Nouakchott and Nouadhibou;
(d) studies to determine ways and means to achieve SONELEC's financial independence; (e) staff
training; (f) technical assistance; (g) the preparation of a program-contract; and (h) external audits
of SONELEC's accounts. Further assistance on financial restructuring and technical assistance was
provided to SONELEC under the Public Enterprise Sector Adjustment Program (Credit 2166 - MAU
of May 30, 1990) and the Public Enterprise Sector Institutional Development and Technical
Assistance Project (US$3 million under Credit 2167 - MAU of May 30, 1990). The proposed project
will consolidate the achievements reached under these projects and continue the strengthening of
SONELEC.
Project Objectives
3.2          The project objectives are:
(a)   to improve water supply service levels and alleviate poverty in Nouakchott by
providing an adequate quantity of safe water to the poor section of the population at
an affordable price;
(b)   to achieve financial discipline and accomplish financial self-sufficiency of the urban
water supply subsector, leading to sustained sector development;
(c)   to improve sector management by strengthening the planning and appraisal
capabilities of SONELEC, its financial and administrative departments, and its
operating and maintenance procedures;
(d)   to prepare a follow up project as described in parts H through V of the investment
program;
(e)   to foster efficient groundwater management and protect and extend the finite life of
Nouakchott's only water source; and
(f)   to improve donor coordination and induce other donors to participate in the financing
of a program securing an adequate water supply for Nouakchott in the medium term.



10
Program and Project Description
3.3          The proposed project is the first part of SONELEC's medium-term investment
pro)gram in the water sector, which aims at securing a safe and reliable water supply for Mauritania's
urban centers up to the year 2000. The investment program includes the construction of the physical
works required to improve the water production and distribution facilities for Nouakchott, where
presently only about 18 percent of the population have access to piped water at home. The design
criteria were kept to an acceptable minimum in order to keep the investments as low as possible. The
water demand forecast by the year 2000 is based on conservative assumptions on population growth,
low per capita consumption figures and expectations of an increased efficiency (see Annex 8). The
program also includes improvements and extensions to water supply systems in Kaedi, Mederdra,
Rosso in the Senegal river valley, where some economic growth can be expected, as well as in seven
other secondary centers. The institutional component of the project aims at furiher strengthening of
SON'ELEC through studies, technical assistance, training and the provision of office and management
equipment nd tools. The program is subdivided in five parts, parts I through IV concerning
Nouakchott and part V concerning the secondary centers. The first part, covering the proposed IDA
project, will lay the technical groundwork for parts II, m  and IV, which could be executed
simultaneously, subject to sufficient financing being available. Part V could be implemented
independently. The program contains the following components:
Part I: Nouak(hot (Proposed IDA project)

3.5          Program financing plan. The program financing for Part I has been secured (see
para. 3.13) up to US$12.8 million. Financing is actively being sought from French sources for the
balance (US$1.0 million). As regards the rest of the program, the Government is approaching
interested co-financiers. Interest has been indicated by the African Development Bank (AfDB, US$15
million), the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE, US$25 million), the Eutopean



12
Investment Bank (US$3 million) and the FED (US$3 m.llion). The Government is also exploring
the possibility of using part of the annual Chinese Aid ailocations to rehabilitate the first Chinese
pipeline between Idini and Nouakchott (point ii of part 11). SONELEC will finance at least 15
percent towards the program out of internally generated funds. A tentative financing plan for the
program is attached in Annex 5.
The Proposed IDA Project
3.6          The proposed IDA project is a coherent set of actions covering part I of the
investment program and a study for the Rosso water supply system. The project includes two
hydrogeological studies. The first will cover the monitoring of the advance of the saline front
towards the existing Idini wellfield. This study will be based on observations on salinity and water
level, taken by local consultants in existing boreholes and piezometers. The information will be sent
to consultants in France as input for their computer model of the performance of the wellfield. The
results will determine the quantities of water that can be extracted out of each borehole so that
permanent damage to the aquifer can be prevented. The second hydrogeological study will
recommend how to manage additional water extraction out of the rrarza aquifer, starting with the
Tenadi wellfield, and will include the preparation of a long term water supply master plan for
Nouakchott, after the Trarza aquifer will be exhausted.
3.7          The project includes a leak detection and repair program. A specialized firm will be
engaged to survey the entire distribution network for leaks and illegal connections and to report on
the condition of the pipework. Repairs will be carried out as the survey progresses. The supply of
specialized leak detection equipment and materials for the repairs will be included in the contract.
Local teams will be trained to continue this activity after completion of the contract, when the
equipment and the remainder of the materials will be transferred to SONELEC.. The firm will also
identify the sections of the network that have to be rehabilitated or replaced and prepare the related
bid documents for the related works. These works will be executed by SONELEC with direct labor
or local contractors.
3.8          The project includes the supply of urgently required spare parts, materials needed for
the construction of 6000 house connections and 100 standpipes and miscellaneous equipment. The
house connections and standpipes will be installed by SONELEC with direct labor or small local
contractors. SONELEC will also install the equipment purchased in the framework of the project.
3.9          The project also includes the construction of an extension to the distribution network
to the northern and poorest suburbs, as well as the preparation of final design and bid documents and
works supervision. In these suburbs, the population has practically no access to water, except
through very expensive water vendors. They will be provided with privately operated public
standpipes where the population can buy water at a fraction of the prices charged by water vendors.
3.10         The project includes the preparation of bid documents for the supply contracts and
the leak detection and repair program, some direct technical assistance to SONELEC, in particular
a hydrogeologist to assist in the monitoring of the salt water intrusion into the Trarza aquifer,
management assistance and miscellaneous studies such as audits, a social study related to the water
vending system in Mauritania, and the final studies for the Rosso water supply system.

Project Cost Estimatp
3.11         Project costs are based on a feasibility study for the Nouakchott water supply carried
out by consultants and the appraisal mission's observations. Base prices are expressed at April 1992
levels. For physical contingencies, 15 percent is added. Inflation for imported goods and services
is estimated in accordance with Bank guidelines (5.9 percent for 1990, 2.0 percent for 1991, 2.8
percent for 1992, 3.9 percent for 1993 and 1994, and 3.8 percent for 1995 through 2000). Local
inflation for the project duration is estimated at 7 percent per year, in accordance with Mauritania's
Ministry for Plan estimates. Prices are free of taxes, estimated at 7.55 percent, which will be borne
directly by SONELEC. Total project costs amount to UM 1102 million in current prices
(US$13.8 million) as set out in the following table and detailed in Annexes 4 and 5.

Readine= of the Project
3.12         The bid documents for the works (except the rehabilitation element), supply contracts,
studies and final designs included in the proposed IDA project (i.e., the first part of t"a program),
are programmed to be prepared during the third quarter of 1992, financed out of a second PPF (see
para. 3.20). Accordingly, by the time of effectiveness, invitations to bid could be advertised and
awards could be made late 1992 and early 1993. The availability of the bid documents of the
extension of the distribution network (item ix) and the supply of materials (item vi) is a condition of
effectiveness. The studies for the rehabilitation works will be done in conjunction with the leak
detection program and are expected to be completed by the end of 1993, allowing works to start in
mid-1994.
project Miancing Plan
3.13         The financing for the project is secured by IDA in the amount of UM 840 million
(US$10.5 million, 76 percent) and SONELEC's participation of UM 192 million (US$2.3 million,
17 percent). Financing is actively being sought from the French for the balance (US$1.0 million,
7 percent).
,he Borrowe
3.14         The Borrower of the proposed investment credit will be the Government of
Mauritania, which will onlend SDR 7.7 million equivalent of the proceeds of the IDA credit to the
National Water Supply and Electricity Company, SONELEC " execute the project. A Subsidiary
Loan Agreement between the Borrower and SONELEC wiL   iulate the conditions of onlending,
which will be a loan at an interest rate of 4 percent, repayab,_ over 20 years including 5 years of
grace. This interest rate will contribute to keeping the water rates affordable. It is estimated that the
beneficiaries of the project belong largely to the poorest segments of Nouakchott's population (see
paras. 5.6 and 5.9 on project affordability). Accordingly, this interest rate is consistent with the
poverty alleviation objectives of the project. It will result in water tariffs approximately equal to the
long run marginal costs.
rocurement
3.15         Works and supply contracts financed by IDA will be procured in accordance with the
Bank's guidelines. International competitive bidding will be used, except for three smaller supply
contracts (each one under US$200,000 and in the aggregate not surpassing US$500,000) for which
international shopping will be used after IDA's agreement of the short-list. These contracts are for
spare parts and replacement parts for which only a limited number of suppliers are available. For
the purpose of bid evaluation, a margin of preference of 7.5 percent will be granted to eligible
domestic contractors bidding on civil works contracts procured through international competitive
bidding, and a margin of 15 percent of the CIP price (or the applicable tariff, whichever is lower)
for goods manufactured in Mauritania and procured through international competitive bidding. The
Bank's standard bidding documents for the supply of goods will be used. Consulting services will
be procured in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. In order to expedite project execution, the
preparation of bidding documents for the procurement of materials and studies (US$S0.10 million) will
be procured from consultants presently in the field ca,iying out all preliminary studies. Contracts
filly financed by SONELEC will be procured through SONELEC's procedures, as described in detail

in the contrat-programme. These procedures are acceptable to IIDA. A list of contracts, with their
estimated cost, to be financed out of the IDA credit is included in Annex 6. The following table

Contract Review
3.16         Between 10 and 15 contracts, with a total value of about US$10.5 million, are
expected to be included in the IDA financed part of the project. A threshold of US$300,000 for prior
Bank review of procurement do ~umentation would result in 25 percent of the number of contracts
covering about 80 percent of the value contracted. On that basis, about four contracts amounting to
about US$8.9 million would be subject to prior review. Random checking of smaller contracts would
be carried out in the field.
2isbursements
3.17         The proposed credit of US$10.5 million would be disbursed against the cost of the
project as depicted in the following table. In order to simplify administrative procedures, SONELEC
will finance 100 percent of the rehabilitation works, the purchase of urgently required spare parts and
the construction of house connections and public standpipes, the CCCE and SONELEC will finance
the hydrogeological studies, and IDA will finance 100 percent of the remainder of the contracts.

Disbursement Proffll
3.19         Bank's records show that disbursements for the water supply sector in sub-Saharan
Africa extend over a seven and a half year period, while country wide disbursements in Mauritania
extend over a seven year period. Taking into account that the proposed project is a simple investment
project included in SONELEC's three year investment plan, and the implementing agency's
demonstrated efficiency In the implementation of earlier water supply projects, it is highly probable
that the proposed project can be fully disbursed within a five year period. The related disbursement
proffies are depicted in Annex 7.
Impementation and Implementation Schedule
3.20         SONELEC, under the tutelage of the Ministry of Hydraulics and Energy, will
implement the project. SONELEC is developing into a capable organization, particularly in the
technical aspect of its responsibilities. It has implemented several earlier water supply projects in a
relatively efficient manner. It is estimated that SONELEC will implement the ptoject over a five year
period as shown in the Project Implementation Schedule in Annex 9.
Ea
3.21         To ensure timely project start-up, the execution of some remaining studies and the
preparation of final design and bid documents for the project are required. Terms of reference for
these studies were discussed during negotiations and consultants will be commissioned shortly to
prepare the bid documents. The availability of these documents is a condition of effectiveness. The
Government has requested a second PPF of US$0.5 million to finance these activities so that works
could start as soon as the credit becomes effective. A first PPF of US$1 million was granted in 1986
to finance hydrogeological studies and was fully refinanced on August 29, 1990 under Credit 2167-
MAU.
Wjct Monitoring
3.22         During project execution, appropriate indicators will be used to monitor, on a
quarterly basis, the financial and technical targets set for the project. Annex 14 provides the target
values of these indicators, which were discussed and agreed upon during negotiations. The indicators
may be adjusted annually in agreement with the Bank. Furthermore, assurances were obtained during
negotiations that:
(a)    SONELEC will report quarterly to the Bank on the progress of the project
components and on evolution of the monitoring indicators; and
()    SONELEC and the Government will take any reasonable remedial action, after
discussion with the Bank, should this become desirable for the proper execution of
the project, the efficient management of the institution, or meeting the targets as set
by the monitoring indicators.
3.23         Agreement also was reached at negotiations to the effect that within six months
following the closing date of the credit, SONELEC will prepare and submit to the Bank a completion
report on the execution and initial operation of the completed project components, the cost and the



18
benefits derived or to be derived thereof, the performance and the fulfllment by SONELEC and the
Government of Its obligations under the Credit and Project Agreements and the Contrat-Programme,
and the accomplishment of the objectives of the Bank credit.
PQetSfleig
3.24         Taking into accaunt the nature of the project, particularly regarding institution
building, a tight supervision schedule will be required. Supervision missions will have to be
dispatched at least twice a year, preferably in conjunction with the participating cofinanciers. A mid-
term review is scheduled for December 1994. This review will pay particular attention to the
environmental aspects of the project and an environmental specialist will join the supervision mission.
In addition to the normal supervision activities, related to the physical implementation of the project
and procurement rules, the monitoring indicators and compliance with covenants have to be followed
closely and strictly observed, as well as the implementation of the environmental management plan.
Environmental monitoring data will be reviewed in detail during each supervision uisslon (Annex
17, para. 1(c)). In case of non-compliance, corrective measures have to be agreed upon and
implemented immediately. A detailed supervision plan including details on staffing requirements is
attached in Annex 10.



19
IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND IMPROVEMENT MEASURES
4.1          Approximately one third of SONELEC's revenue is derived from the sale of water
with the remaining two thirds obtained from the sale of electricity. The financial analysis has taken
into consideration both aspects, although for the purpose of this project, emphasis has been placed
on the water operations. In 1988, SONELEC found itself in a very precarious situation with respect
to its financial as well as its operational position and thus a contrat-programme was introduced with
the objective of redressing this situation. The results to date have been encouraging with SONELEC
meeting a number of the targets. However, the Government failed to respect certain conditions of
the contrat-programme especially with regard to tariff increases and the settling of arrears. The
second contrat-programme (that will enter into effect on June 12, 1992) will take into account these
shortcomings as well as other areas that were not adequately addressed in the first contrat-
programme.
Taxes and Import Duties
4.2          Under the first contrat-programme, SONELEC was exempted from taxes. These
taxes included the BIC (ImpOt sur Benefice Industriel et Commercial, calculated as 50 percent of
profit), the IMF (Impot Minimum Fiscal, 4 percent of turnover), as well as the TPS (Taxe sur
Prestations de Services) and the TAP (axe d'Apprentisage). Under the second contrat-programme,
as of July 1, 1992, SONELEC will be required to pay these taxes which have been estimated at about
UM 102 million for 1992 and approximately twice that for subsequent years. More significantly,
however, is the fact that SONELEC, under an agreement (Ordonnance No. 89 027) dated February
1, 1989, will continue to be exempted from import duties on fuel, materials and equipment, etc.,
through 1993. As the custom duty on fuel is about 40 percent, this savings represents an important
element in the operating costs of SONELEC. As of January 1, 1996, however, SONELEC will have
to begin paying normal import duties. This fact has been taken into account in the financial
projections.
Past and Present Performance
4.3          SONELEC's Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Sources and Uses of Funds
Statement for the years 1989-200 are shown in Annex 12. From 1989 through 1991, sales grew
by 20 percent whereas working expenses grew by 46 percent. Spare parts which represented 21
percent of working expenses in 1991 increased by 108 percent over the last 3 years. Personnel
expenses represent about 20 percent of working expenses. The contrat-programme specified the
objectives to attain for the ratio of quantity billed/quantity produced. The volume of water produced
in 1989 was 11.7 million m3. This grew to 12.4 million m3 in 1991, representing an increase of 6
percent. Losses in the production and transport system in 1989 represented 3 percent of the volume
produced. In 1991, the losses were 5.2 percent. On a more positive note, the ratio of amount
billed/quantity produced increased from 57 percent in 1989 to 75 percent in 1991 for water, a
significant increase due in large part to improved managemenit. There was a marked improvement
as well for electricity where the ratio increased from 75 percent in 1989 to 86 percent in 1991.



20
Biling and Collection
4.4          SONELEC bills its customers on a two month cycle except for large customers and
standpipe operators who are billed monthly. All of the billing is computerized. It was agreed during
negotiations that by January 1, 1994 SONELEC will revise its billing system to include a bill every
other month that is based on an estimate of the previous month's consumption. Monthly billing
would not only reduce SONELEC's workin, capital requirements, but would also strengthen bill
collection in that it would impose greater financial discipline on clients, raising their awareness of
having to set aside funds for payment of their utility bills monthly instead of every two months.
4.5          Collection of bills has been a persistent problem although significant improvements
have been demonstrated since the introduction of the contrat-programme. For example, accounts
receivable decreased from UM 967 million in 1Wr9 to UM 921 million in 1991. Collection from
private customers is excellent and these improvements are reflected in the above figures. At the end
of 1991, the average collection period for private clients stood at about 60 days. The problem has
been the collection from Government. This situation is addressed in the second ccntrat-programme
by requiring that Government budget a sufficient amount to cover its utility bills and that it pay 1/6
of the budgeted amount each billing period. Not honoring the contrat-programme would lead to
suspenion of disbursements.
4.6          With regard to the amounts actually billed, SONELEC increased the biling (water
and electricity) from 1,755 million Um in 1988 to 2,488 million Um in 1991, which represents an
increase of 42 percent. The collection rate increased over the same period, increasing from 71
percent in 1988 to 90 percent in 1990. For 1991, the situation deteriorated due to the fact that the
Government has not yet settled its accounts within the framework of the cross-debt workout. During
negotiations, it was determined that the balance due SONELEC as of December 31, 1991 was UM
432 million, of which UM 232 million had been settled by the Government prior to negotiations.
The settlement of the remaining UM 200 million is a condition of credit effectiveness.
4.7          During appraisal, the mission learned that the Government had obliged SONELEC
to include in its monthly billing a television and radio tax that amounts to UM 600 per biDling period.
As this amount often is more than the water and utility bill for many customers, the new contrat-
programme stipulates that as of July 1, 1992 this tax no longer be included in SON'3LEC's bills.
4.8         IN 1990, SONELEC's permanent capital amounted to UM  3.8 billion.  The
Government is the sole shareholder. The debt/equity ratio (calculated as medium plus long-term
debt/total equity) stood at 65 percent. The contrat-programme stipulated a ratio of 60 percent. The
preliminary figures for 1991 show a ratio of 57 percent. A clause in the second contrat-programme
requires that SONELEC maintain a debt/equity ratio of less than 60 percent.
Tariffs
4.9          The last tariff increase dates back to April 1988. In the first contrat-programme, two
tariff increases were agreed to but not implemented by the Government. As of January 1990, an
increase of 11.1 percent for electricity and 20.5 percent for water should have been implemented
followed by another increase in January 1992 of 6 percent for water and 8 percent for electricity.
Instead the Government agreed to compensate SONELEC for the difference between revenues



21
received and what would have resulted had the tariffs been applied. These amounts figured in the
settlement of the cross debt situation between SONELEC and the Government.
4.10         The above-mentioned increases were based on a tariff study done by consultants in
late 1988. This work was updated during appraisal with revision of the assumptions (number of
personnel, better cost recovery, smaller investments, etc.), and the mission concluded that a tariff
increase on April 1, 1992 of 10 percent for both water and electricity would allow SONELEC to
break even in 1992. This increase of tariffs was implemented as of May 1, 1992. The structure of
the present tariff is presented in Annex 11.
4.11         In order to overcome the difficulties arising from too infrequent tariff adjustments,
water and electricity tariffs will be automatically adjusted semi-annually by 7.5 percent, beginning
in January 1993 until the expiration of the second contrat-programme (June 11, 1995). A tariff study
is to be undertaken 6 months prior to the expiration of the second contrat-programme so that a new
level of tariffs and/or change in tariff structure can be determined. Although automatic tariff
increases will take place semi-annually, there will still be a need to assess these forecast rates on a
regular basis in light of the rate of return covenant or possible significant changes in the factors of
production (i.e. fuel oil, etc.). It is therefore proposed that SONELEC prepare by the end of October
of each year starting in 1992 a forecast for the next year of its capital and recurrent budget and the
tariff adjustments required for meeting this objective, to submit this report to the Government and
a copy to the Association for its review and comments. Should this forecast indicate that a higher
rate is required, SONELEC will have to request the interministerial committee to approve the
additional increase. It is important to note that the increases that are included in the contrat-
programme will go into effect even if the Government disputes the additional increase that may be
necessary in order to satisfy all objectives included in the contrat-programme.
4.12         In addition to increasing the normal tariffs, the preferential tariff that SONELEC
employees benefit from will be increased to a more reasonable level. As well, the ceilings for both
the quantities of water and electricity to which the preferential tariff is applied will be brought to a
moderate level. A schedule for implementing these changes was agreed to during negotiations. It
was also agreed during negotiations that SONELEC will inform IDA prior to conclusion of contracts
with important industrial clients that their financial consequences are not detrimental to the financial
objectives as set out in the contrat-programme.
4.13         As of July 1, 1992 a tariff for sewerage of UM 10 per m3 of consumer water will
be introduced as a sewerage surcharge for those customers connected to the sewerage network.
Presently, SONELEC does not charge for these services. During negotiations, an agreement was
reached whereby the Government will reimburse SONELEC for its costs to operate and maintain the
networz net of the amount recovered from the customers with a sewerage connections.
4.14         In order to permit SONELEC to continue to cover its operating and maintenance
expenses as well as to service its debt and to finance at least 15 percent of its investment program,
agreement was reached and included in the second contrat-programme that tariffs be set such as to
achieve an equilibrium in 1992 and a rate of return on revalued net fixed assets in operation of one
percent in 1993 and growing to three percent in 1995 (two percent rate of return on revalued net
fixed assets in operation growing to five percent in 1995 according to Bank definition where interest
is excluded from the calculation of operating expenses). The objective of revenue covenants is to
attain adequate levels of cost recovery and contribution to investment from internally generated funds.



22
Given that the contrat-programme addresses the concerns of inadequate tariff increases, level of
Government arrears, and the debt/equity issue, the rate of return covenant was judged to be
appropriate for this project.
4.15         Experience has shown that a rate of return covenant should be supplemented by a
working ratio (cash operating expenditures over revenues). Containing and reducing the cost of
operations is an objective of SONELEC's management. This commitment was confirmed duiring
negotiations and agreement was reached whereby SONELEC will take all necessary actions to ensure
that its working ratio will not be higher than .60 in 1992 and no higher than .55 from 1993 onwards.
As SONELEC will finance capital expenditures through borrowing in the future, an agreement were
obtained during negotiations whereby SONELEC will not incur any additional debt without prior
consultation with the Association unless its net revenues are at least 1.5 times its debt service
requirements.
Future Operations and Financial Projections
4.16         SONELEC's forecast balance sheet, income statement, and sources and uses of funds
statement to 2000 are given in Annex 12, with the underlying assumptions in Annex 13. The
projected cash generation is based on the combination of planned tariff increases, the containment and
reduction of operating costs, as well as the achievement of the forecast reduction in arrears.
4.17         SONELEC's future financial position will, to a considerable degree, depend on the
observance of the contrat-programme by both SONELEC and the Government. In summary, it
outlines technical, operational, financial and administrative targets and sets the framework within
which SONELEC has to operate and the pri±ciples to which the parties have agreed. The new
contrat-programme's objectives are ambitious although attainable for the period 1992-1995.
Insura
4.18         SONELEC carries insurance covering motor vehicles, fire damages for buildings,
third party liability and special coverage for damages caused by accidentally spilled water, all of
which are considered adequate. SONELEC is self-insured for workmen's compensation and has set
up a special fund for this purpose. All supply and civil works contracts for the project will be
insured by private companies against loss or damage in shipment, accidents, fire and property
damages. SONELEC's insurance coverage is considered to be adequate.
Accounting and Auditing
4.19         Before the implementation of certain actions carried out through Cr. 1567-MAU, the
accounting policies and systems of SONELEC were inadequate and outdated, billing and collection
procedures were weak and error prone, and internal controls over stocks, treasury, and fixed assets
were insufficient to provide adequate managerial control. Some improvements have resulted in that
an accounting system has been in place and the annual accounts are audited every year by an external
auditor. The proposed project will continue the effo.-ts in this domain by improving client
management and reducing account receivables, continuing the training of staff and the development
of systems and procedures and by developing sound financial and tariff policies.



23
4.20         SONELEC's accounts have been audited by a local auditing firm financed under
Cr.2167-MAU. .'resently, there are no outstanding audits and SONELEC is in compliance with all
financial covenants. Agreement was reached during negotiations that its accounts will continue to
be audited by auditors acceptable to the Association and the audited accounts, together with the
auditor's report be made available te the Association not later than six months after the end of each
of its fiscal years.
Summary of Financial Management Actions
4.21         The second contrat-programme, signed and approved by the Government and
acceptable to IDA, is attached as Annex 16. It contains many actions which will have the effect of
strengthening SONELEC's financial position. The major points are the following:
1.    Articles 2.1.1 and 3.6: In order to achieve financial equilibrium in 1992 and a rate
of return on net revalued fixed assets in operation of 1 percent in 1993 increasing to
3 percent in 1995, semi-annual increases of 7.5 percent for water and electricity are
authorized starting January 1, 1993 until the end of the contrat-programme. The
calculation for this rate of return includes interest and other financial charges
according to SONELEC's normal accounting terminology. Six months before the
expiration of this contrat-programme, a tariff study will be undertaken to determine
the new level of tariff increases required for the third contrat-programme.
2.    Articles 2.1.2 and 4.5: The clients who are connected to the sewerage network will
be billeu a sewerage surcharge of UM 10 per m3 consumed. The Government will
take over the sewerage assets as well as the debt service for these and will pay to
SONELEC the balance of the costs of operating and maintaining the network not
covered by the surcharge.
3.    Article 2.4: The Government agrees to budget an adequate amount for water and
electricity consumption and will pay every 2 months 1/6 of the budgeted amount and
will settle the outstanding amount based on the actual amount consumed in the billing
following the end of the fiscal year.
4.    Article 3.5: The Director General of SONELEC has full authority in all aspects of
managing personnel. Personnel will be kept at a level to meet the efficiency
objective of 68 meters installed per agent in 1992, evolving to 100 meters per agent
in 1995.
5.    Article 4.9: The Government will allow SONELEC to open a convertible account
so that it will have access to foreign exchange in order to pay its suppliers within the
contractual limits.
4.22         Third Contrat-Programme. The second contrat-programme will expire on June 12,
1995. In order to ensure continuity, a third contrat-programme should be in place by then. During
negotiations, agreement was reached whereby a third contrat-programme acceptable to IDA would
be put into place by June 12, 1995. In the event that this is not done, the existing contrat-programme
will continue in full force and effect.

V. ROJECT JUSTIFEICATION
5.1          The proposed project is justified by the universally recognized fact that the provision
of an adequate quantity of safe water is a basic necessity for the maintenance of good health and
productivity. This justification is enhanced by the fact that the additional inhabitants that will be
served - approximately 60,000 through household connections and 100,000 through standpipes -
belong to the poorest segments of Nouakchott's population. For these people, the project will have
a substantial poverty alleviation impact, not only through improvements in their living conditions, but
also by substantially reducing the price that they pay for water (water vendor rates can be ten times
or more the SONELEC tariff). In addition, the provision of adequate infrastructure, including water
supply, is a prerequisite for economic development. In particular, the supply of water to the capital
city of Nouakchott, will lift constraints on urban development. The project will also improve the
efficient allocation of a rare national resource, "water" and it will promote water conservation and
reduce wastage. Moreover, if the project would not be realized by 1996, according to groundwater
experts, salt water intrusion could permanently damage the Idini aquifer and substantially reduce the
future water resources available for Nouakchott. Thus the project will contribute to averting a major
environmental problem. Lastly, the project has enhanced donor coordination as a result of close
cooperation with prospective cofinanciers during preparation. Therefore the project makes an
effective contribution toward the development process in Mauritania.
Least Cost Solution
5.2           The proposed project covers a part of SONELEC's investment program in the water
sector for the 1992-95 period. The designs of the proposed systems, as well as the adopted basic
assumptions on water use and demand forecast, represent least cost solutions based on discount rates
of 8 percent, 10 percent and 12 percent. Studies for the expansion of the production system have still
to be carried out and are included in the project.
Institution Building
5.3          Although SONELEC has already proven to be a relatively efficient organization, it
will further be strengthened by the project, specifically in its administrative, and financial and water
resource management functions. In particular, SONELEC has adopted a "Return on Revalued
Assets" covenant, which will enable it to contribute at least 15 percent towards its investment
program. Also its billing and collection operations will be streamlined. The project will also
strengthen SONELEC's capacity to appraise small projects, to plan its long term development
program and to maintain and operate its facilities. Furthermore, SONELEC will put into place by
January 1993 an analytical accounting system that differentiates the water, electricity, and sewerage
activities with the aim of having a better management control as specified in the new contrat-
programme. They will also strengthen their hydrogeological expertise so to manage more efficiently
their groundwater resources.
Beneficiaries and Benefits
5.4           The total urban population of Mauritania will benefit in varying degrees from the
project as sufficient quantities of potable water become available. A safe accessible supply of water



25
is especially important in a desert country like Mauritania, where very few alternative sources
(springs, rivers) are available, and particularly in Nouakchott where the population's access to water
has dropped by one-third over the five-year period 1986-91. To address this growing need for water,
the project will place a particular emphasis on providing water to the kebes surrounding Nouakchott.
The project will allow many of Nouakchott's low-income neighborhoods to be connected to the water
distribution system for the first time. The program expects to increase by 35 percent the volume of
water being provided to the population of Nouakchott by the year 2000. Nouakchott will also benefit
from improved sanitary conditions resulting from the AfIDB's sanitation project. Improved water
supply service levels will also benefit the population in terms of time and money saved.
5.5          In total, it is expected that the project will create 50 permanent jobs. In addition, the
construction activities will create about 2,000 man-years of temporary employment.
Affordability
5.6          Recent household surveys as analyzed in the Poverty Profile prepared by the Ministry
of Plan show that roughly half of the population of Mauritania is considered to have an income below
the relative poverty threshold of US$275 (UM 22,000) per year. Non-food expenditures represent
an average of about 30 percent of household total expenditures (estimated at UM 5500/month). With
regard to expenditures on water, statistical evidence indicates that on average a family of six spends
a total of UM 220 per month for water taken from public standpipes while low income families with
house connections spend about UM 240 for water. This represents about four percent of the income
at the poverty threshold, which is within the normally accepted level of affordability.
5.7          It has been estimated that water vendors number around 1000 and that their average
monthly income is about UM 5000, slightly above the minimum salary (SMIG) of UM 4310
(US$54). Considering their operating expenses and the long distances travelled, this income is not
exaggerated. Since not very much is known about this "secondary" water market, studies to examine
the organization, marketing conditions, and demand for services of water vendors will be undertaken
during project implementation. Moreover, the monitoring of this market will be a priority for
supervision missions.
5.8          Water vendors using mule-driven carts are by far the largest providers of water in
the urban areas, servicing more than 60 percent of the urban population. This is true irrespective of
the level of household income. Even many wealthy households in urban areas do not have access
to clean water and depend on water vendors (over 50 percent of households in the highest expenditure
quintile in urban areas do not have access to piped water). The unfortunate aspect in this water
distribution system is that one-quarter of the population of Nouakchott is more often than not out of
the circuit of water vendors and thu. iiot supplied with water on a daily basis. When these vulnerable
groups are able to get, water, they are charged exorbitant prices that can reach 12 times the tariff paid
by the water vendor at a public standpipe. In general, the population serviced by water vendors pays
from UM 50 to UM 250 for a barrel of 200 liters, while the vendor buys the water at UM 100/m3
(equivalent to UM 20/barrel).
5.9          The price of water is not only a function of the strong demand, but also of the
distance vendors have to travel, the time it takes to fill containers at the public standpipes and the
season of the year. The proposed project includes the construction of about 100 standpipes in some
of the poorest neighborhoods of Nouakchott, which are expected to benefit around 100,000 people.



26
This will partly meet the growing demand for a reliable system of clean water & reduced prices.
With the improvements in the water supply system, including higher water pressure and more
standpipes, it will take water vendors less time to fill their containers and to deliver the water over
shorter transport distances. This will likely result in a significant price drop, down to UM 50 per
barrel as has been experienced in some newly-served neighborhoods. The project therefore meets
one of its main objectives by providing an essential commodity at an affordable price to the
population.
Financial Justification
5.10         Financially the project is sound. Tariffs have been set and will be adjusted semi-
annually at such a level that SONELEC will be able to make a return on revalued assets of 2 percent
in 1992, increasing to 5 percent 1995 (World Bank definition, excluding interest). The project is
sustainable as SONELEC will be able to cover its operation and maintenance expenses and service
its debt and finance at least 15 percent of its investment program. The project is self-financing and
will not unduly increase the national debt.
Economic Justification/Rate of Return
5.11         The economic justification of the investments in the water supply sector included in
the project is indicated by the fact that the standard taritf is approximately equal to the long run
marginal cost (LRMC) of water (UM 1 10/m3) based on a 10 percent opportunity cost of capital,
which is considered adequate for Mauritania, Annex 15 contains the marginal cost calculations. The
rate of return, estimated at 10 percent, is underestimated as it does not take into account the non-
tangible benefits such as consumer surplus and health benefits. In the rate of return calculation, the
amounts paid for water were used as a proxy for benefits. The willingness to pay for water is much
higher than the tariff which results in a considerable consumer surplus.
Environmental and Public Health Aspects
5.12         The proposed project has been designed to accentuate the positive environmental
impacts of the project and to contribute to a long term environmentally sound management of the
water supply sector. This Category B project will contribute to extending the finite life of the fossil
aquifer that Nouakchott depends on for its water supply through funding of more efficient
groundwater management practices and groundwater monitoring, and staff training and technical
assistance programs (Arnex 17). The major environmental impact of the project will be the
protection of the finite non-renewable groundwater resources of the Trarza aquifer, and an increased
potential for saltwater intrusion into the aquifer. Recent hydrogeological studies strongly recommend
the construction of a new wellfield no later than 1996 to prevent the irreversible saltwater
contamination of the existing wellfield that provides Nouakchott with its only source of water. The
environmental management plan, agreed upon during negotiations and attached as Annex 17, will
require the development of a groundwater protection plan for the aquifer and the preparation of a
long term water resource management plan to supply Nouakchott with water. The cooperation that
the entire project will necessitate among the various government services implicated will contribute
substantially to strengthening the country's capability to deal with environmental and public health
issues in the future.



27
5.13         Responsibility for environment protection is distributed among several government
Ministries, and specific environmental impact assessment guidelines do not currently exist in
Mauritania. For the first time, SONELEC carried out an Environmental Assessment (EA) as part
of the project preparation work for the rehabilitation and expansion of the Nouakchott water supply
system. This report was finalized during negotiations on the basis of the comments received from
the Government of Mauritania and the Bank. The report will be made available to the public for
review at the offices of SONELEC, and at each of the nine municipal district offices in Nouakchott.
5.14         The proposed repair program for the water distribution network will contribute to
minimizing the depletion of the limited groundwatc. resources available. The storage reservoir repair
and construction program and the planned leak detection and repair program will increase pressures
in the distribution system and minimize the potential for pollution of the system during low pressure
periods. The increased water system pressure will also allow the extension of the distribution system
into the distant periphery areas of the city where many of the poorer sections of the population live.
The significantly increased quantities of potable water that will be provided will be particularly
beneficial in reducing water-borne and water-washed diseases; particularly conjunctivitis, dysentery,
and diarrheal diseases which make up three of the four leading diseases present in Mauritania.
5.15         The expansion of the distribution system will result in an increase in the volume of
water sold by water vendors and the amount of water stored at home. This increases the
opportunities for the accidental pollution of the water. A public health education program on safe
water storage and transport practices via the media and the existing neighborhood organizations is
recommended and is included as an action to be completed as part of the Environmental Management
Plan (Annex 17, para. 4(a)).
5.16         An increase in the disposal of wastewater is a potential negative environmental
impact. Approximately 96 percent of the population of Nouakchott utilize individual wastewater
disposal systems consisting principally of latrines, seepage pits, and septic tanks. The increased
quantities of water made available to the public will primarily go to new consumers in low population
density areas where the soil and groundwater conditions are conducive to waste water disposal by
individual installations. Given the low density of the population, the relatively limited volumes of
wastewater involved, and the saline groundwater aquifer already underlying the city, the expansion
and upgrading of individual wastewater disposal systems is a suitable solution.
5.17         The central area in Nouakchott is equipped with a water borne sewer system. The
sewage treatment plant presently discharges untreated sewage to the surrounding market gardening
area for use in irrigating food crops. The treatment plant is currently being rehabilitated with
financing from the AfDB. It is recommended in the environmental mitigation plan (Annex 17, para.
4(b)) that a health information program to inform the public of the potential health dangers presented
by consuming vegetables grown in the gardens adjacent to the wastewater treatment plant, and
recommended treatment techniques to use before eating, should begin no later than September 1,
1992. To further improve the situation a study is recommended for the re-use of treated sewage for
irrigation. This study should be commissioned before the end of 1992, and agreement on the
conclusions and the implementation thereof should be reached before July 1993.
5.18         The Environmental Management plan attached as Annex 17 summarizes the specific
actions that will be required to ensure that potential beneficial impacts on the environment and public
health will accentuated, and will ensure that the long term development of the water supply and



28
sanitation sector will be consistent with environmental practfces. During negotiations, agreement was
reached that the Government and SONELEC will carry out this plan within the set time frame.
Rika
5.19         The risk of not implementing the physical components of the project within the set
time frame is small. SONELEC has demonstrated that it is capable of implementing similar size
investment projects. Additionally, SONELEC will be assisted by consultants in project design and
supervision, and technical assistance will be provided to strengthen its project management capacity.
However, the risk of not achieving the institutional and financial objectives within the set time frame
is not negligible. The precarious economic and tight financial situation of the country will make the
reappearance of arrears to SONELEC possible, notwithstanding Government assurances that future
payments will be made within legal time limits. The impact of this risk is minimized by covenants
allowing the Association to suspend disbursements in case payments are more than 90 days in arrears.
Equally, tariff increases are unpopular measures for the Government to take; the introduction of
automatic semi-annual tariff increases supported by appropriate covenants will encourage the
Government to honor its commitment.

of water and utility and will pay to SONELEC 1/6 of this budgeted
amount every billing period with a compensation taking place in the
next year's first billing (paras. 4.5 and 4.21);



30
(v)      the number of personnel will be adjusted so as to attain a ratio of 68
meters installed per agent in 1992, evolving to 100 meters per agent

31
(f)    a working ratio not higher that .60 in 1992 and no higher than .55 from 1993
onwards (para. 4.15);
(g)    SONELEC will not incur any long term debt (except for projects covered by the
agreement), without IDA's concurrence, unless its net revenues at the time of
incurrence of :he debt, before depreciation ana interest, are at least 1.5 times the
maximum future annual debt service on the proposed loan and existing debts (para.
4.15);

fl)   agreement will need to be reached whereby a third contrat-programme acceptable to
IDA is put into place by July 1, 1995 (para. 4.22).
6.3          Conditions of Credit Effectiveness would be:
(a)   the entering into a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and
SONELEC under terms and conditions mutually acceptable to Government,
SONELEC, and IDA (para. 3.14);
(bD   the contrat-programme has been ratified by the borrower and declared effective
(paras. 4.1 and 4.21);
(c)    Government will settle the remaining balance of the arrears due to SONELEC (UM
200 million) before credit effectiveness (para. 4.6);
(d)   an auditor, acceptable to IDA, will be recruited to audit SONELEC's accounts (para.
4.20); and
(e)    bid documents, acceptable to IDA, for the acquisition of materials and the expansion
of the distribution network will be available (para. 3.12 and 3.21).
6.4          SONELEC and the Government will take any reasonable remedial action, after
discussion with the Bank, should this become desirable for the proper execution of the project, the
efficient management of the institution, or meeting the targets as set by the monitoring indicators
(para. 3.22).



32
6.5          IDA may consider suspension of disbursements in case a situation should arise, (a)
which would make it improbable that the strategy and objectives of the project, as described in this
document, would be sustained and/or (b) where breach of contrat-programme has taken place where

Notes on financial prolections
LIntroduction
SONELEC operates the electricity and water production facilities in Mauritania.
Approximately two thirds of SONELEC's revenue is derived from the sale of electricity and one third
from the sale of water. The financial analysis has taken into consideration both aspects, although the
emphasis has been placed on the water operations. The 13 cities project with FADES financing, that
has been postponed due to the Golf crisis has been further postponed, due to the scale of the project.
The investments for the electricity component largely follows the latest update of the tariff study,
dated July 1991. With regard to the water component a more detailed analysis has been made, tariff
increases have been discussed with SONELEC and the Ministries of Finance and of Hydraulics and
Energy. Furthermore, several major changes are put forward for consideration.
L     JIncome
Te income projections for 1992 - 200) are based on the expected water consumption, taking
into account the constraints imposed by the production capacity. The latter has been recently
increased with regard to Nouakchott to 30,000 m3 per day and the capacity will increase considerably
from 1996 onwards. Till then replacement of pumps on existing wells is assumed to increase the
capacity of the existing well field temporarily.
dTariffs
Tariff increases have been postponed after the initial increases of the first contrat-programme.
The Government filled the resulting gaps by subsidies. In order to avoid similar deficit financing a
first increase of 10% is assumed to take effect in April 1992 for both water and electricity.
Thereafter, regular tariff increases of 7.5% every 6 months would be necessary for water. For
electricity similar increases are assumed up to 1994 and again in 1996, when a 40% custom duties
on imported equipment and materials are assumed to take effect. In the beginning the average
increases of the water tariffs are slightly higher due to the reduction of the size of the second (of
three) tariff steps. Tariff steps comprise 0-1Om3/month for the social tariff. It is this second step
from 10-30m3/month which is proposed to be reduced to 10-20m3. SONELEC would study the
possibility to reduce the first step from 0-10 to 0-5m3/month and to increase the tariff of the third
step, but the effect of these measures on the average tariff are not yet included in the financial
analysis.
The increase of the average tariff is amplified by abandoning preferential tariffs with SAFA
as of April 1992 and SNIM when the relevant contract expires in May 1994. This implies that tariff
increases for domestic customers can be stopped earlier than in the case of water.
(A study by SONELEC which compares the affordability of water from public stand pipes and when
bought directly or from water vendors should indicate the feasibility of installing considerably more
public stand pipes to reduce the high prices charged by water vendors due to the large transport
distances. These prices presently reach 5 - 10 times the social tariff).
4.    Billing and Collection
The overall efficiency has improved considerably during the first contrat-programme. A leak
and fraud detection program and the installation of master meters will allow SONELEC to maintain

their efficiency. For the future only minor improvements in the order of 0.5% per year are assumed
to be feasible.
Accounts receivable. other payment delays and bad debts
In the future monitoring of accounts receivable will be separate for government and private
accounts. In the recent past a reduction from 6.3 month in 1989 to 3.5 to 4 months has been realized
and in the present analysis a reduction to 3 months is assumed. Bad debts are assumed at 6%.
Due to credit arrangements with the (algerian) fuel supplier, the average delay of payment
of suppliers is maintained at 5 months. With regard to stocks, the turn-over of stocks was 8 months
several years ago and is taken at 6 month in 1992 and 5 months thereafter.
0,    Expenditure,s
The number of employees stood at 790 at the end of 1991. The average for 1992 is assumed
at 760 as a reduction to 730 before or on the first of July 1992 has been agreed. Thereafter personnel
would remain constant until the increase of the number of connections reaches 100 per employee.
,Tis implies that total personnel would not be increased until 1997.
Fuel and energy expenditures are estimated on the basis of technical parameters with regard
to fuel consumption per kWh and internal consumption of energy with regard to water pumping is
based on energy consumption per m3 of water pumped. The use of chemicals and consumption of
materials and spare parts with regard to production is related to water production and electricity
production. In distribution the use of such items is related to the number of connections. Expenditures
are in current prices. Many items are imported and inflation is therefore based on a weighted average
of local inflation (7% per year) and internaC-onal inflation (average 4.4% per year).
Annual depreciation of the existing assets is based on:
1. projected depreciation of the assets in 1987
2. projected depreciation of the assets entering operation up to 1991 and based on
SONELEC's accounting rules with regard to lifetimes;
3. depreciation of project works is again based on the lifetimes prescribed by the accountancy
system of SONELEC;
4. annual revaluation from 1992 onwards is based on 80% of projected inflation.
27    Balance Sheet
Total gross assets and total accumulated depreciation have been revalued preliminary at the
end of 1991 by an estimated 20%, awaiting the results of a more detailed revaluation effort planned
in 1992.
L       Lptj Dutiea
Exoneration of import duties terminates in 1996. Tlis applies to investment related imports,
to fuel and to the items related to SONELEC's expenses.

9L    Income and other taxes
Exemption of income and other taxes ends with the present contrat-programme in June 1992.
It is assumed that these taxes (estimated at 6.2% of total revenues) will be applied for the remaining
half of the year 1992 and onwards.
E     Rate of Return and Cash Generation
The rate of return'of water supply activities would be increased from 1% per year, aiming
at a target 5% on net revalued assets. The; resulting (net) cash generation will be used to finance part
of the investments, aiming at a minimum of 15%. The analysis tests for this assumption annually,
while aiming at 15% or more during the project period 1992-1995.

Proposed Monitoring Guidelines
General
1.    SONELEC will prepare quarterly and annual progress reports to be submitted to the
Association. Quarterly reports will be submitted not later than one month after the end of each
reporting quarter and the annual report no later than March 31 of the following year. The quarterly
report will include the targets as indicated in the contrat-programme (see attachment) and what was
actually achieved as well as the information described below. The annual report will include a
synthesis of the quarterly reports and a forecast of activities and expenditures for the following year.

Project Completion Report
3.    SONELEC will prepare a Project Completion Report (PCR) to be submitted to the
Association not later than six months after the closing date.
4.    The basic objective of the PCR is to reinforce the self-evaluation capacity by SONELEC and
the Association's operating departments and to facilitate dissemination of lessons learned through the
project. The PCR will examine and assess:
(a)   the performance by the Borrower and the Association of their respective obligations
under the Credit Agreenment;
(b)   the results that can be expected from the project, as compared with expectations at
appraisal and whether the original expectations were realistic; and,
(c)    whether in retrospect the project could have been done better.
S.    The basic documents to be referred to are: Credit Agreement and supplementary letter;
consultants' reports; staff appraisal report (SAR); contrat-programme; supervision reports;
quarterly and annual reports; correspondence files.

RATIOS DE STRUCTURE FINANCIERE
1.  TAUX DE RENTABIUTE
11 est obtenu en divisant le resultat net d'exploitation par 13 valeur nette moyenne des
immobilisations en service resvaluees.
Le resultat net d'exploitation se definit comme la difference entre les produits dexploitation
et les charges d'exploilatlon, y compris les amortissements et les provisions pour
d6pr6ciation d'elements d'actif. mais A l'exclusion des provisions pour perte de change sur
prets en devises.
La valeur nette moyenne des immobilisations en service reevalu6es est obtenue en faisant la
moyenne arithmetique de la valeur nette (c'est-a-dire apres amortissements) des
immobilisations en service en d6but d'exercice et de la valeur nette de ces :mmobilisations
en fin dexercice.
Les objectifs fix6s par le contrat-programme (0% en 1992. 1% en 1993; 2% en 1994 et
3% en 1995) s'entendent aprbs reevaluation des immobilisations au 31 decembre 1992.
2.  RATIO D'ENDETrEMENT
Le ratio d'endettement a long terme est calcuI6 en divisant le montant des dettes A long et
moyen terme de la sociste en fin d'exercice par le montant des capitaux permanents A la
meme date.
Les dettes a long et moyen termes s'entendent apres reevaluation eventuelle des emprunts en
devises, mais en excluant la part des dettes qui viennent A 6ch6ance dans les douze mois
suivant la cloture d'un exercice.
Les capitaux permanents sont la somme des fonds propres (dotations en capital, r6serves,
reports A nouweau. r6sultat de 1'exercice,...) et des dettes A long et moyen termes.
3.  RATIO DAUTOiNANCE-MENT
Ce ratio est calcule en faisant le rapport entre la capacite d'autofii ncement degagee au cours
oun exercice et le montant des investissements bruts realises au cours de ce meme exercice.
La capacite d'autofinancernent est d6finle comme suit:
* resultat net
* + amortissements
.+ provisions assimilables A des exigibilites A moyen et long termes (ex.: provision pour
pertes de change sur emprunts en devises)
*   reprise sur subvention d'equipement
Le ratio d'autofinancement est calcul6 chaque annee, mais une appreciation definitive ne peut
etre portde qu'en fin de contrat-programme. en determinant le niveau moyen qui a ete alteint
pendant son diroulemenl.

3.  CREANCES iRRECOUVRABLES
Par d6finltlon, iI ne peut y avoir de creances irrecouvrables que sur les sommes facturees
aux clients r,riv6s, a quelque titre que ce soit, a 1'exception des sommes dues par IlETAT
(Administrations et clients cautionnes).
Le taux des cr6ances irrdcouvrables est donc calcule en falsant le rapport entre les
provisions constitu6es a ce titre et le montant total des sommes facturees correspondantes.
Los objectifs fix6s par le contrat-programme sont les suivants
1991          1992            1993          1994           1995

4.  PORTEFEUILLE CLIENTS
Deux ratios distincts doivent Otre calcul6s, Iun pour les clients priv6s, Iautre pour les
clients ETAT:
* Clients priv6s
Le ratio, exprime en mois, est calcul6 en divisant le solde des comptes clients prives net
de provisions pour creances Irrecouvrables en fin de periode, par le douzilbme de la
facturation annuelle correspondante (d6finie en annee mobile).
L'objectit est de maintenir le ratio a 2 mols maximum pendant touto la duree du contral-
programme.
* Clients ETAT:
Le ratlo, exprlm6 en mols, est calcule en divisant le solde des clients ETAT
(Administrations + Clients cautlonn6s) en fin de perlode, par le douzieme de la
facturation annuelle correspondants (d6finie en annee mobile).
L'objectif est de moner ce ratio de 9,4 mois a fln 1991 a 3 mols au cours des annees
suivantes.
5.  RATIO BRANCHEMENTS/EFFECTIFS
Ce ratio est obtenu en divisant is nombre moyen de branchements en service (6lectricitd, eaiu
et assalnissement) au cours de la perlode, par 1'effectif total remunerb pendant la meme
periode.
Le nombre moyen de branchements est egal a la moyenne arithmetique entre le nombre de
branchements en service en debut et en fin de periode.
Leffectif a prendre en compte comprerd la main-doeuvre temporaire et la main-d'cuvre
int6rimaire, mals exclut le personnel affect6 aux projets ou autres tAches et dont la
rdmun6ration nest pas prise en charge d'exploitation. Cot effectif est decomptl en
hommes/mois en tenant ci^mpte du temps r6mundr6 pendant la p4riode considdr6e.
Lobjectif fixO par le contrat-programme est le suivant:
1991         1992           1993          1994          1995
46           68             78            89           100
Chacun des indicateurs de performance definis ci-dessus est calcule par mois ainsi qu en
annee mobile.

The following actions acceptable to IDA will be necessary to ensure that the short term
and long term impacts of the activities to be financed by the project will be consistent with sound
environmental practices:
Long Term Planning and Monitoring
(a)    A plan to supply Nouakchott with sufficient potable water once the Trarza aouifer
is exhausted should be prepared and submitted to the Bank within two years of
the completion of the hydrogeological investigation of the Tenadi well field that
is proposed in Part I of this project.
(b)    Given the importance of the Trarza aquifer to the water resources of Mauritania,
a detailed plan stating the responsibilities of the Directorate of Hydraulics and
SONELEC in the monitoring of the aquifer should be prepared by July 1, 1992.
(c)    Terms of Reference for the monitoring of the Idini and Tenadi wellfields
(including geochemistry and water table movement) and its estimated annual cost,
prepared jointly by SONELEC and the Ministbre d'Hydraulique, should be
completed before September 1, 1992.
(d)    A detailed groundwater protection plan for the Trarza aquifer, including an
outline of the agencies responsible for enforcing the plan, should be prepared by
the Ministere d'Hydraulique and SONELEC by January 1, 1993.
(e)    A detailed training and staffing plan to address the water resource and
environmental human resource needs identified in the enviromnental impact
report should be prepared by the Ministry of Hydraulics and Energy by January
1, 1993.
(f)    As a preliminary step to creating other centers of economic development and to
winimizing rural migration to Nouakchott, the finalization of feasibility studies
for the water supply of the secondary centers of Kaedi, Rosso, and Mederdra,
should be completed by December 31, 1992. A summary of the awtion taken to
date on the November, 1991 report prepared for these centers by INPG
Consultants should be included also.

2.           P1blic Review
(a)    At negotiations, agreement has been reached on the Environmental Impact Report
prepared by SONELEC. The report will be made available to the public for
review at the offices of SONELEC, the Ministere d'Hydraulique, and at each of
the mne municipal district offices in Nouakchott within 6 weeks of the
finalization of the report.
3.           Distribution System Improvements
(a)   Tre design report prepared by SAFEGE for the future water supply of
Nouakchott shoulu be finalized by December 31, 1992. The final report should
indicate in detail which works will be realized in each phase of the project, and
how these activities will address the servicing needs for the expected future
growth of the c,ty. The report should also indicate the plans for, and control of,
urbanization at the well field and along the pipeline corridor.
(b)    To better assure the quality of the water being sold to consumers from the public
standpipes, a survey of the repairs required at these fountains and a plan for their
repairs acceptable to the Bank should be completed by October 15, 1992. Other
measures that the Government of Mauritania and SONELEC believe should be
carried out to improve the quality of water distributed should also be included in
this report.
(c)    A plan acceptable to the Bank to implement a system to chlorinate water at the
Idini well field and at the elevated reservoir in Nouakchott should be completed
by December 31, 1992.
4.           Waste Water Disposal
(a)    A detailed plan for the implementation of the public health education and
wastewater studies referred to in the environmental impact report carried out by
SONELEC should be completed by December 31, 1992 with the participation of
the technical department and the implicated institutions. A public education
component promoting water conservation as well as safewater storage and
transport nractices should also be includled as part of this plan.
(b)    A public health information program to inform the public of the potential health
dangers presented by consuming vegetables grown in the gardens adjacent to the
wastewater treatment plant, and recommended treatment techniques to carry out
before eating them, should begin no later than September 1, 1992.

wastewater treatment plant to allow the wastewater to be safely used for
irrigation, or the identification of an alternative wastewater disposal option should
be included in this report, As an alternative a change in cultivation has to be
devised focussing on cultures thriving on wastewater stemming from a
conventional water treatment plant without a public health hazard. A detailed
plan for the disposal of the sludge produced from the treatment plant, and for the
maintenance of the sewer collection system sho'dd also be included in the study.
5.           Constuction Activities

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.   Environmental Evaluation
This Environmental Impact report represents the
documentation of the environmental assessment (EA) process for
the World Bank funded portion of the Mauritania First Water
Supply Project. The Socidt4 Nationale d'Eau et d'ElectricitA
(SONELEC), as the executing agency for the Government of
Mauritania, carried out the assessment of the environmental
impact of the rehabilitation and expansion of the water supply
for Nouakchott.
The EA documents the planning and design phase of the
project which terminates with the construction of the Eroject.
It includes a discussion of the purpose of the project the

The EA report also addresses the maintenance and o2e; ation
aspects of the project, the environmental effects expected from
these, and the mitigation measures proposed.
This preliminary report is to be finalized before
negotiations begin on the basis of the comments rece-ived from -'he
Bank and the consultant. The finalized report w.ll be made
available for public review in Mauritania.
2.   The Project
The supply of potable water for Nouakchott, the 7apital of
Mauritania, is presently provided by 18 production wcEis at the
Idini well field. This well field is located approx .ately 60
kilometres east of the city and exploits the Trarza iuifer. The
population of the city was 550,000 in 1991 and, with a grc?wth
rate of 11 percent, is expected to reach 1,200,000 in the year
2000. It is proposed to rehabilitate and expand the produiction,
transport and treatment facilities of the water supply syc,tert to
meet the water supply needs of the population of Nouakchott until
the year 2000. The area to be serviced by the project a.nvludes
the city of Nouakchott, its periphery settlements, and the
population living in the areas of the well fiel1 and adjacer.t to
the pipeline corridor.

The first phase of the prQject will fund a iQak.detection
and repair program, expansion of the 44_tribution system to the
poorer p-oriphery areas of the city, detailed design and
constrution supervisior co¢+, and technical assistance.
Detailed hydrogeological stuadii  will be carried out to evaluate
in detail the potent-ial of the existing well field and the
additional weli field to be developed.
3.   Principal Conclusions and Recommendations
Cost add m.ulti-criteria analyses of six groundwater, surface
water and desalination water supply alternatives were carried
out.  The ana'ysis indicates that she solution consisting of the
simultaneous exploitation of the Idini and Tenadi well fields is
the preferred alternative.
The ma1or environmental impact of the project will be the
utilisation of the finite non-renewable groundwater resources of
the fossil water contained in the Trarza aquifer, and an
increasea potential for saltwater intrusion into the aquifer. The
proposed ptoject will contribute to extending the finite life of
the groundwater resources available through funding of more
efficient groundwater management practices and groundwater
.aonitoring, long term groundwater resource plan.,ing, and staff
training and technical assistance programs.
The construction of a new well field and a oc,-ecting
pipeline will take place in a very lightly populatc. sub-desertic
Sahelian environment. No negative impacts are anticLpated on the
existing pastoral population, or flora and fauna of the area. A
protective perimeter is recommended around the new well field to
prevent groundwater pollution from residential, commercial, or
industrial activities that may develop.
The proposed repair program for the water distribution
network will contribute to minimizing the depletion of the
limited groundwater resources available. The storage reservoir
repair and construction program, and the planned leak detection
and repair program will also increase pressures in the
distribution system and minimize the potential for pollution of
the system during low pressure periods.
The increased water system pressure will allow the extension
of the distribution system into the distant periphery areas of
the city where many of the poorer sections of the population
live. The planned extension of the distribution system will
follow the existing, and expected, directions of urban growth.
The additional quantities of safe water to be provided will be
beneficia'  in reducing the incidence of water borne and water
washed diseases prevalent in the project area.

Tile expanr ion of the distribution system will also result in
an increase in the volume of water sold by water vendors and the
amount of water stored at home. This increases the opportunities
for the accidental pollution of the water. A public health
education program on safe water storage and transport practices
via the media and the existing neighbourhood organisations is
recomn'ended.
Approximately 96% of the population of Nouakchott utilises
individual wastewater disposal systems consisting principally of
latrines, seepage pits, and septic tanks. The majority of
domestic wastewater is disposed of in public spaces. An increase
in the disposal of wastewater is a major potential negative
environmental impact. Given the high groundwater conditions and
low grades available in the city an expansion of the sewer system
is not feasible. However, given the low density of the
population, the relatively limited volumes of wastewater
involved, and the saline groundwater already underlying the city
a program for the expansion end upgrading of individual
wastewater disposal systems is a suitable solution and is
recommended.
The central area in Nouakchott is equipped with a water
borne sewer system. The treatment plant presently discharges
untreated sewage to an adjacent 26 hectare market gardening area
for use in irrigating food crops. The repair and rehabilitation
of the sewage treatment plant is expected to be completed by
October 1992 and will significantly ameliorate the existing
situation.
The report also recommends a closer collaboration among the
various services implicated in the water and sanitation sector to
mitigate potential negative impacts at all stages of the project
cycle.
