MEMORANDUM AND RECOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TI IlDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECrORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO MAURlTANIA
FOR A WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to Maritania for SDR 7.7 million, the equivalent of US$10.5
milko, on standard IDA terms with a maurity of 40 years to help finance a water supply
project.
2.           C=LAtor  Background. Mritaia, a desert country with a very narrow
resourebase, compris over 1,000,000 km2. Thepresentpopulation (1991) is estimated atjust
over 2 million and is growing at approximay 2.9 percent per annum. As a result of declining
economic prospects in Mauritania's rural areas, there has been substantal migration to urban
centers from all parts of the coutry, except from the Senegal valley region, where some potential
for growth exists. The largtst urban centers are Nouakchott, the capital (550,000 inhabitant),
Nouadhlbou, the industrial capital (60,000 inhabins), Kaedi (40,000 inhabitants) and 5 other
centrs with more than 30,000 people each. The availability of safe water and of adequate urban
infratuctur plays a key role in the development of Mauritnia where rapid desertification is
leading to an extremely high rate of urbanization (growth rate of Nouakchott: close to 11 percent
per year). Half of Nouakchott's residents are housed in provisional shelters, and water supply,
santo, waste diposal and health are critical problems. Poverty is rampant. Recent household
srveys indicate tbat approximately half of the urban population of Maurania is considered to
have an income below the reltve poverty treshold of US$275 per year (UM 22,000). Only
18 percent of the population has direct access to clean piped water; the remainder is served by
prvaed standpipes or by water vendors who resell water purchased from these standpipes. No
alterntive resurces are avalable in this desert environment Ihe inadequate availability of safe
water and sanitation facilities contribute to a high rate of disease among the population. Among
the four leading diseses in Mauriania  ree are water-elated, I.e., diarrhea, conjuncdvitis, and
dysentery. These health problems are paricularly severe in the peripheral settlements of
Nouakchott.
3.           Responsibility for urban water supply is entusted to the Societe Nationale d'Eau
et d'Electricit4 - SONELEC (the water and electricity public utility). IDA's involvement in the
water sector has been through a series of public enterpriseltehnical assistance projects where
progress was made to strengthen and restrucure public enterises such as SONELEC.
Continued impleenotation of instittonal and financial reforms as well as leak and fraud
detection are needed (i) to reach ful cost recovery and address current sectoral constraints related
to the difficult economic situation of the country which have made Government arrears endemic
and have led to the avoidance of tariff increases, and (d) to make opdmal use of the limited water
resurces available.
4.             oectObjectives  Ipreposedprojectwouldimprovepublichealth and living
conditons by increasing the quaity and quantity of potable water available to about 160,000
residents (25 percet of Nouakchott's population) and would assist the Govermment to strgthen
SONELEC to enable it to admbis  the sector more effectively. In specific terms, the project
alms to: (a) to improve water supply service levels and alleviate poverty in Nouakchott by



-2-
providng an adequate quantity of safe water . the poor section of the population at an affrdable
price; (b) to achieve fancal discipline and accomplish financial self-sufficiency of the urban
water supply subsector, leating to sustained sector development (c) to Improve sector
mana,gement by strengthening the planning and appraisa capabilities of SONELEC, its financial
and adminstrative departments, and its operating and maintenance procedures; (d) to foster
efficient groundwater management and protect and etend the finite life of Nouakchott's ondy
easily exploited water source; and (e) to improve donor coordination and induce other donors to
participate in the fincng  of a program securing an adequate water supply for Nouakchott in
the medium term.
S.           Prqect PesLdgJho. Ihe proposed IDA project is a coherent set of actions,
covering the first part of SONELEC's medium-term investment program for the water sector.
The project covers the most urgent rehabilitation and extension works and lays the technical
groundwork for the other works Included in the investment program. The project includes two
hydrogeological studies; the first will involve the monitoring of the advance of the saline front
tows cds the exsting Idini wellfield; the second will recommend how to manage additional water
emt Xion out of the Traza aquifer, startig with the Tenadi wellfield, and wiUl include the
prepartion of a long term water supply master plan for Nouakchott, after the Trarza aquifer will
be exhausted. The project also includes a leak detection and repair program. Repairs will be
carried out as the survey progresses. The project would finance the supply of urgendy required
spare parts, materis needed for the construction of 6000 house connections and 100 standpipes
and misllaneous equipment. The house connections and standpipes will be installed by
SONELEC with the help of local cottractors or by direct labor. The project also includes the
cnstruction of an etension of the distibution network to the northern and poorest suburbs, as
well as the preparation of final design and bid documents and works supervision. In these
suburbs, the population has practically no access to water, except through very expensive water
vendors. Ihey will be provided with privately operated public standpipes where the population
can buy water at a fraction of the prices charged by water vendors. in addition, the project
includes the preparaion of bid docummens for the supply contracts and the leak detecton and
repair program, ad-hoc technical assistance to SONELEC, in particular a hydrogeologist to assist
in the monitoring of the salt water iusion into the Tra aquifer, managemen assis e and
miscllaneous studies such as audits, a social study related to the water vending system in
Maurnia, and final stdies for the Rosso water supply system.
6.                     1           SONELEC, under the uelage of the Ministry of
Hydraulics and Energy, will implement the project. SONELEC is developing into quite a
technically capable organization, particularly in the technical aspect of its responsibilities. It has
implemented several earlier wat supply projects financed by other donors in a reladvely
efficient manner. It is estimated that SONELEC will implement the project over a five year
7.           eMit Susib. Ihe second contrat-programme includes a proviSion for
automatic semi-annual tariff increases which will not only allow SONELEC to cover its operation
and mainen        expenses and serice its debt, but also to finance at least 15 percent of its
investment program from interally generaed funds. In addition, SONELEC will be remunerated
for its coms to opera  and mainain the sewerage network, a service for which it was not
previously compensated.



8.                          ~                           TLesn Learned from P  ID volym    . The project closely follows
the lessons of the ongoing projects, in particular the P.E. Rehabilitation and Technical Assistance
Project (Cr. 1567-MtAU) and the Public Enteprise Sector Instition  Development and
Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 2167-MAU). The rehabilitation of SONELEC has been
pariay achieved through the imple ion of the *contrat-programme" signed in 1989 by the
Governmnt and SONELEC, which was sponsored by IDA and which was the first one in
Mauritaia and was carried out within Cr.1567-MAU. The proposed project would enable the
strengthening of the operational capabilities of SONELEC through continued technical assistance
and the introduction of a second contrat-programme to be in effect on June 12, 1992. The
problems encountered in the ongoing contrat-programme notably Government's reluctance to
increase tariffs and its inability to pay its water bills, have been addressed by having the contrat-
programme be an integral part of the Credt Agreement.
9.           Rationale for Bank n mn. The water supply sector in Mauritania remains
grossly underdeveloped. Investments have lagged behind urban growth ad coverage is
inadequate. Because properly functioning ii'rastructure is essential for the alleviation of the
conditions of abject poverty that characterize most of the peripheral neighborhoods of Nouakchott
and is also one of the prereqtisites for economic advancement, the development of an adequate
and efficienly run water and electricity utility is crucial for the growth of Maitia. It is
esfimated that at least 50 percent of the beneficiaries of the project are from the poorest segment
of society. Considering the poverty alleviation objectives, the wnlending rate of 4 percent and
the low ROR on net revalued fixed assets in operation is justified on the grounds of keeping the
water tariffs affordable. Ihis interest rate will result in water tariffs approximaely equal to the
long run marginal costs. IDA's catalytic involvement has been and will be instrlmental in
assistig the Government and donors to implement appropriate sector development strategies.
It should also be effective in mobilizing additional externa resources. The high priority given
by the Government to this project, as evidenced by the iniiaves already undertaken under the
Public Eneprise Technical Assistance and Rehabilitation Project and the rapidity with which the
first range of actions on tariffi and arrears have been taken, is a reflection of Government's
strong commtment to insttute sound management principles and concepts.
10.          Agred Actons. The major sector issue is the non-payment for water consumed
by Govnent and the municipalities resulting from the country's precarious financial situation.
In addWon, Goverment has been reluctant to implement the tariff increases as stipulated in the
on-going contrat-programme. The result is that SONELEC remains in a prearious financial
position. Agreement on the following actions and documents has been reached.
(a)    a tariff increase of 10 percent for both water and electricity, which was put into
effect May 1, 1992;
(0)   settlement of the arrears due to SONELEC for water and electricity consumpion
through 1991 in two steps, UM 232 million (which was settled before
negotiations) and the remainder (UM 200 million) before effecdveness;
(c)   tariffs will be set at such that a rate of return (including financial charges) for
water on net fixed assets in operation of zero percent in 1992, one percent in
1993, two percent in 1994 and three percent from 1995 onwards will be
obtained;



-4-
(d)    a new conatprogramme which was signed on April 16, 1992 inclu45ng
Gover nt  commitments: (1) to allow  SONE-MC  to  nese  tariffs
automtically by 7.5 percent every six months strting in Jamnary 1993; (I) to
allow SONEEC to propose additional tariff inreases to take account of
unforesee changes in its costs structure resulting from economic policy changes;
and (Hii) ta SONELEC maintail a debt-equity rado of at most 60 percent;
(e)    a letter of sector policy;
f     an enionmenta assessment and environmental management plan; and
(g)    tat bid domen  for the major civil works contcs will be ready before
effectiveness.
More specfically, conditions of effectiveness are:  (a) the entering into a
Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and SONELEC; (b) the contrat-programme
ratified and declared effective; (c) setdement of the balance of the arrears (UM 200 million); (d)
the recrukment of an independent auditor acceptable to IDA to audit SONELEC's accouts; and
(e) the availability of bid documents for the major part of the civil works and supply of material
conacts.
11.          Enviental Aseet. Ihe proposed project will contribute to xending the
fnite life of the non-renewable goundwater resources of the Tram  fossil aquifer through
funding of more efficient groundwater management practices, groundwater monioring and
tchic  assisance programs. Full consideration has been given to mimizing any poial
iwpact at aU stages of the project cycle. The proposed repair program for the distribution
network wi increase pressres in the distbution system and minimize the poteni for pollution
of the system during low pressure periods. The increased water system pressure wil also allow
the exnion of the distibution system into the distant periphery areas of the city where many
of the poorer sections of the population live. The center of Nouachott is equipped with a
sweage system. A study is proposed for the safe re-use of treated sewage for irrigation, which
will ameliorate the present suation where untreated sewage is used to irrigate food crps. The
soil and groundwater conditions in the low population density areas are conducive to waste water
disposal by individu istallations   ines, seepage pits). An envronm    impact study of the
project was carried out by SONELEC for the first tme, with the assistance of an environ
seialist. The report will be made available to the public for review, and is included in the
Project File. The coopation that this project will necessitate among the various Government
services involved wil contribute substantially to strengthening the Government's capabilities in
deang with evir e   and public health coN erns.
12.          Pzggo wectbie canxtigrm. Since approximately 160,000 of Nouakchott's
poorest inhabitants wM be served by the project, the project wiUl have a sbtant  poverty
aleviation impact, not only through improvements In their living conditions, but also by a
reduction in the price they pay for water. As well, safe driing water is one of the most
important basic human needs and is indispensable for sustaining and enhancing life. Social and
economic benefits also are to be gained from access to a clean and reliable supply of water. The
project will also contbute  baaly to improving te management of a public utflity and to
improvw endI      tl management.



-5-
13.          to=BeR s. The proposed project is justified by the universally recognized
fact that the provision of an adequt  quantity of safe water is a basic necessity for the
maintenance of good health and productivity. Ihis justification is enhanced by the fact that the
additional inhabitants that will be served - approximately 60,000 througb household connections
and 100,000 through standpipes - belong to the poorest segments of Nouakchott's population.
For these people, the project will have a substantial poverty alleviation impact, not only through
improvements in their living conditions, but also by substanaly reducing the price that they pay
for water (water vendor rates can be ten times or more the SONELEC tariff). In addition, the
provision of adequate infrastructure, including water supply, is a prerequisite for economic
development. In particular, the supply of water to the capital city of Nouakchott, will lift
constraint on urban development. Ihe project will also improve the efficient allocation of a rare
national resource, water", and it will promote wate conservation and reduce wastage.
Moreover, if the project would not be realized by 1996, according to groundwat exts, salt
water intrusion could permanently damage the Idini wetlfield and substantilly reduce the fuure
water resources available for Nouakchott. Thus the project will contribute to avetng a major
environmental problem. Lastly, the project has enhanced donor coordinaton as a result of close
cooperation with prospective cofinanciers during preparation and makes an effective contribution
toward the development process in Mautania
14.         Rlak. The risk of not implementing the physical components of the project
within the set time frame is small. SONELEC has demonstrated that it is capable of
implemening similar size inwestment projects. Additionally, SONELEC will be assisted by
consultants in project design and supervision, and technical assistance will be provided to
strengthen its project management capacity. However, the risk of not achieving the institutional
and financial objectves within the set time fama is not negligible. The precarious economic and
tigbt financial situation of the country will make the reappearance of arrears to SONELEC
possible, nwithstadingGovernment assurances dtat fiture payments will be made within legal
time limits. The impact of this risk is minimized by covenants allowing the Assciaon to
suspend disbursements in case payments are more than 90 days in arars. Equally, tarff
increases are unpopula measures for the Government to takle; the introduction of automatic semi-
annual tariff increases supported by appropriate covenants wil encourage the Government to
honor its commntma
15.          R2MMend2t;Ons. I am sadsfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Aricles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Execudve Directrs approve
it.
