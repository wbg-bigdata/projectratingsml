I. STRATEGICCONTEXTANDRATIONALE

A. Country and sector issues

 1.      Anhui Province, with about 65 million people, is one of the most populous and densest
provinces of China. Its density-of about 460 persons per km2-is                   more than three times the
national average. The province i s crossed by the Yangtze River and Huai River, and is adjacent
to six provinces. Compared to its more successful neighborsto the east and north-Zhejiang,
Jiangsu, and Shandong-Anhui            has lagged markedly behindinsocio-economic development,
with a GDP per capita around one third the average level of those three provinces and two years
inreducedlife expectancy (73 vis-a-vis 75 years). Comparedto those to the west andsouth-
Hubei, Henan, andJiangxi-Anhui              has more similar-though slightly lower-socio-economic
indicators. Within Anhui, there is great regional disparity, with most of the wealth concentrated
inindustrial regionsclose to the Yangtze River.

2.       Anhui's geographic location-right           to the west of Shanghai and Hangzhou metropolitan
areas-makes       the province anatural crossing area for the interchangeof industrial products and
technology betweenthe more developedcoastal provinces and those less prosperousto the center
andwest. Inline with the Central Government's initiative of "Rise of Central China" which is
part of the EleventhFive-Year Program (EFYP), definedas crucial for a coordinated and
harmonized developmentbetweeneastern, central and western areas, the Anhui Government has
elaboratedits own strategy of "Development to the East", with an aim at expediting the
incorporation of the various regions of Anhui to the comparatively more affluent regions of the
Yangtze Delta, including those poorer areas (inthe north and south of Anhui). Transport is one
of the priorities inthat development strategy.

3.       Although the existing highway network of Anhui Province (of about 71,000 km)
represents a sizable network interns of kilometers per inhabitant, the average service level i s
limiteddue to the relatively low technical standards. Comparedto the six surrounding provinces,
the density ofthe network (kmperpopulation) is abovethe average, while the percentageof
pavedroads (as a proxy for the quality of the infrastructure) is the lowest.2 This results inlikely
shortcomingsof the existing highway network inmeeting futuretransport demand. Other major
issues of current highway network include: (a) connections on the east-forward corridors
consisting of lower-class type of roads: (b) poor quality of pavement and weak resistanceagainst
disaster; and (c) unbalanced distribution of network across the regions inAnhui Province. The
Government of Anhui has then advancedaprogram for upgrading and reconstructing existing
national andprovincial trunk highway network-the              so-called "5 15 Engineering Program"-to
enhance the level of service and traffic capacity, while minimizing the needs for land acquisition.
This program-which is part of the national EFYP-involves                   severalconcurrent actions that



1Agricultural activitiesinAnhui vary accordingto the climate zones that the provincecrosses. North ofthe Huai
He river wheat and sweet potatoesare grown, while south of that river it is rice and wheat instead. Natural resources
ofAnhui also include iron inMa'anshan, coal in Huainan, and copper inTongling. There are industries relatedto
these natural resources (e&, steel industry at Ma'anshan). One ofthe famous Anhui-basedcorporations is the
automobile company Chery which is based in Wuhu.

builduponthe progress made inthe last few years,3 with highway and waterway investments for
about US$13 billion, as follows:

           (a) Expansion o f the expressway network to the Yangtze Delta and to regional central
                 cities inthe Province, reaching a total lengtho f 3,500 km (from about 1,500 km
                 completed at the end o f 2005), realizingthe goals o f (a) three-hour travel from east
                to west and six-hour from north to south inthe Province; (b) round trip on the same
                day from provincial-governed cities to Hefei; and (c) expressways accessible to 90%
                counties (cities) and one-hour trip to nearbyexpressway for all counties.

          (b) Enhanced connections ofthis expressway network to the national andprovincial
                trunkhighway network, constituting amutually supporting layout, which could
                provide a more effective infrastructure for the economic development o fthe
                province. The "5 15 Engineering Program" includes the rehabilitation and
                improvement o f about 5,700 km o f national and provincial trunk highways, with
                about US$1.25 billion allocated to improving road geometries, structural strength,
                and pavement roughness. This program seeks to enhance the level o f service o f the
                existing road infrastructure under the direct responsibility o f the provincial
                communications department while reducing the encroachment into scare land
                resources.

          (c) A rural roads program to support the expansion o f the network towards ensuring
                village access to the provincial network by 201Os4

          (d) Improvementsto inlandwaterways to achieve 5,600 kmo ftotal mileage in inland
                navigation and 280 million-ton capacity o f harbors.

4.        Inparallel to that investmentprogram, highway maintenance inthe Province requires to
be strengthened, with enhancedmethodologies andtools for the programming o fpreventive and
periodic maintenance activities and improvements to the implementation o fthose activities. In
Anhui, roadcondition is rankedusingfour levels ofrating system, Le., excellent, good, bad and
very bad, and each level is determinedon the basis of five attributes or road asset component^.^
Based on such a ranking system and measurements that are often carried out visually, statistics
would show that about 80% o f the road network inAnhui i s in good or excellent condition. This
assessmenthowever appears optimistic and has to be adjusted to take into account the


3 During"the tenth five-year plan" period, Anhui Province increased investmentand accelerated constructionto
realizerapid growth of transport infrastructure scale, substantiallyforming a comprehensivetransport system framed
by trunk railways, expressways, main navigation waterways and important airports.
4 As part ofthat strategy, the Provincial Governmentalso intendsto speed up investments for enhancingthe
condition of rural roads. The constructionprogram of "bitumen (cement) road accessible to every village" has been
started in 2006. By 2010, it is expectedto form arural roadnetwork which connects with national and provincial
trunk highways,complies with rural socio-economic development,and meets living and production demands of
rural populations. Investmenton rural roads is expected to reachUS$2.25 billion, through support to the
(re)construction and improvement of about 60,000 kmofrural roads and realizing the goal of 80% of administrative
villages having access to apavedroad.
5 The five attributes are: (a) pavementcondition; (b) roadbedand sub-grade condition; (c) bridge and culvert
condition; (d) safety facilities along the road; and (e) landscaping. Each ofthese attributes is assigned aweighting
factor in the overall assessment.


                                                            2

particularities o f each factor and the higher importance o f the pavement condition as key element
whenmeasuring overall road condition; also the fact that Anhui Provincial Communications
Department's (APCD) current plan is to improve/rehabilitate about 5,700 kmo f
national/provincial roads seems to suggest that more than half o f the national/provincial network
i s inless than fair condition. Based on the above considerations, an estimate o f the condition o f
the national and provincial network would indicate that only up to 46% are ingood and fair
conditions. Enhanced measurement and a cutting-edge management system-which                would
improve from the older version o fthe Chinese Pavement Management System (CPMS) with
limitedanalytical capabilities-would      allow better assessment o f road conditions and optimal
programming of maintenance activities.

 5.      Inaddition, currently, maintenance activities are carried out through the so-called
maintenance stations composed o f APCD own-administration (force-account) labor. This
mechanism appears to have room for improvement, particularly through the establishment o f
incentive-based contractual relationships. The APCD i s aware o f the importance of maintenance
and seeks to establish improved road management and maintenance approaches, alongside those
currently beingimplementedfor the control o f overloading, more efficient toll collection
mechanisms, and a wide-ranging road safety program. The proposed project seeks to contribute
to these efforts.


B. Rationalefor Bankinvolvement

6.       The Government o f China has requested the World Bank to support the implementation
o f the rehabilitationand improvement o f provincial/national trunk highways within Anhui
Province and attain the full benefits o f an efficient transport network by fostering its integration
o f villages and towns withinthe Province and o f those networks with its neighboring provinces.
The Anhui Provincial Government has further expressed its desire to secure a World Bank loan
to complement APCD's own resources in support o fthe "5 15 EngineeringProgram." As a result
o f the previous two highway operations inAnhui Province, APCD wishes to continue with the
value added cooperation through the Bank's support infinancing projects that require broad
strategic approaches and benefit from the exchange o f international experiences and institutional
strengtheningmechanisms. The Bank is technically and financially ina good position to
contribute to the incorporation o f up-to-date approaches and tools for strengthening APCD's
capacity inmanagingthe national and provincial road networks inAnhui.


C. Higher levelobjectives to which the projectcontributes

7.       The interventions being considered under the project are inline with the Bank's FY06-10
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) with China particularly under the second pillar where the
upgrading o f transport infrastructure, while improving network management and traffic safety, i s
singled out as an element for poverty reduction, inequality, and social exclusion. Enhancingthe
linkages o f the inlandprovinces to the dynamic coast i s seen as a critical step to widen the
benefits of accessibility to the larger population and, particularly, to its poorer segments.
Ultimately, those interventions should help improve the productivity inAnhui Province, enhance



                                                   3

its competitiveness, and increase the inter- and intra-provincial trade, which will consequentially
foster the development o f Anhui and the provinces to the west.

8.       Inthis respect, the project seeks to contribute to the highergoals of (a) improving living
conditions across the province-particularly      inthe areaswhere poverty rates are higher-by
enhancing the transport accessibility to economic opportunities and social services, and
(b) stimulating higher economic growth inthe Anhui Province by reducingtransport costs within
the province and betweenAnhui and, particularly, the neighboring provinces o fJiangsu and
Zhejiang, to the east o f Anhui.


11.      PROJECT DESCRIPTION

A. Lendinginstrument

9.       The Bank will finance the project through a Specific Investment Loan. The Borrower has
selected the Variable-Spread Loan (VSL) option, with annuity payment and a repayment period
of 26 years, inclusive o f a grace period o f five years. The Borrower's main reason for selecting
these terms i s because they follow more closely the construction and life cycle o f the
investments,with more evenrepayment amounts.

B. [IfApplicable]Programobjectiveand Phases

 10.    Not applicable.

C. Projectdevelopment objectiveand key indicators

 11.     The project aims to increase the effective use o fthe road infrastructureinthe Anhui
Province to support its social and economic development, as evidenced by the increase inthe
flows of passenger and freight traffic along key corridors across the province at lower costs and
with improved safety. The objective would be achieved through priority interventions to
improve the condition o f the roads across the province, pilot more efficient initiatives for road
maintenance, and enhancements to the programming and management capacity o f APCD,
towards optimizing the use o f resources for the upkeepo f road assets.

12.     The assessmento fthe achievement ofthe project development objective will be carried
out through the measurement o f the following outcome indicators: reduction inaverage freight
rates along a representative sample o f key provincial and national road corridors, and reduction
intravel times onthe rehabilitatedor improved roads. The results ofthe project will also be
measured by another set o f intermediate outcome indicators such as (a) increased traffic volumes
on the corridors to be upgraded or rehabilitated; (b) reduction inaccident rates; (c) percentage o f
APCD budget allocated to maintenance and rehabilitation; (d) application o f alternative
mechanisms for road maintenance and recycling approaches for road rehabilitation; (e) progress
inthe implementationofenhanced programmingtools for the allocationofresources for the
preservation o f road assets; and (f) APCD's enhanced knowledge and application o f road
management approaches through specialized training and study tours. The proposed set o f
results indicators is included inAnnex 3.

D. Projectcomponents

 13.     Buildinguponthe investmentsand activities accomplished underthe previous two World
Bank projects inthe province and inthe context o f strengtheningthe current overall framework
for the management and upkeepo f road assets inthe Anhui Province, the project will include the
following components:6

ComponentA. RoadRehabilitation
[estimated cost US$193.61 million-47.3% o f the total project cost - o f which US$97.70 million
will be financed bythe Bank Loan]

 14.     This component will support the provincial rehabilitation and maintenance program from
2007-2010 under the EFYP. The Bank contribution will help finance eligible investmentsunder
the rehabilitation component ofthe program. A list of 18 segments to be rehabilitated, for about
890 km, has beenevaluated and found acceptable inthe context o f the province-wide program o f
the roadnetwork rehabilitation. Activities under this component consist of improving pavement
conditions o f the roads by resurfacing, specific structural strengthening, and limitedadjustments
to the alignment when requiredto improve safety. This component includes the pertinent
supervision activities o f the rehabilitationworks to be undertaken by local supervision firms.

15.      Inthe event that any resettlement might be requiredunderthis component, a resettlement
action framework has been prepared. Similarly, simplified environmental impact assessments
and standardized environmental specifications have beenprepared for their application inthe
rehabilitation works (as part o fthe environmental documentation for the project).

ComponentB. RoadImprovement
[estimated cost US$209.85 million- 5 1.2% o f the total project cost -of which US$99.79 million
will be financed by the Bank Loan]

16.      Improvement or upgrading o f about 320 km o f key provincial and national roads located
on the central-eastern and southeastern areas o fthe Province. These improvements or upgrades
would include in some cases the duplication o f existing roads following the same alignment with
specific bypasses inbuilt-upareas (inorder to minimize resettlement actions) or with short
segments o fnew alignments ifnecessary to avoid difficult topographical conditions. Intwo
cases (roads S311 and S322), this component will include the construction o f a limited number
o f kilometers to increase the transport capacity o f the existing corridor or complete missing
segments. Inaddition, for road S322, this component includes the relevant complementary
elements to make the road an eco-friendly road. The supervision o f the works under this
component will be undertaken by local supervision firms and financed with local funds.




6The projectcosts for eachcomponentincludephysicalandprice contingencies. The percentagesare calculated
from a total projectcost of US$410 million, inclusiveof a front-end-feeofUS$0.5 million (0.25% of the total loan
amount).


                                                        5

17.     This component is the only one that will require resettlement. Itwill also include the
implementation o fthe relevant environmental management plans. The cost o f the actions to take
into account the safeguards requirementsare included inthe estimated cost reported above.

ComponentC.Pilot on RoadMaintenanceby Contract
[estimated cost US$1.95 million - 0.5% o f the total project cost - o f which US$0.96 million will
be financed by the Bank Loan]

18.     Underthis component, APCD will implement maintenance by contract approach inat
least two highway segments o fthe provincial highway network for a cumulative number o f 120
kilometers by the end o f the project. The maintenance activities will be limitedto routine or
periodic interventionswithin the existing road pavement width. The final design o f this
component will be supported by a technical assistance, as further described below, that will help
APCD with additional knowledge and analytical elements for exploring the alternative
maintenance mechanisms as well as for the preparation and implementationo f the selected
contractual schemes. The supervision will be carried out by local firms supported by the
previously mentioned technical assistance.

ComponentD.InstitutionalStrengtheningProgram
[estimated cost US$4.09 million- 1.0% o f the total project cost - o f which US$1.05 million will
be financed by the Bank Loan]

19.    This component includes the provision o f improved tools for road management
(technical, environmental, and economic) and a training program, as follows:

             a study on technological options for the recycling o f pavement materials when a
             pavement needs to be rehabilitated;

             the technical assistancefor the pilot on maintenance by contract to provide the
             knowledge and analytical elements for exploring alternative mechanisms for
             contracting o f maintenance activities as well as for the preparation, implementation,
             supervision, and assessment o f the preferred contractual scheme under the pilot;

             the preparation o fstandardized environmental specifications;

             support to APCD's Anhui Highway Administration Bureau (AHAB) in
             implementingthe enhanced version ofthe Chinese Pavement Management System
             (CPMS) inAnhui Province, to be financed with local funds;

            the analysis o f socio-economic impacts o f key roads to be improvedunderthe
            project, towards establishing an enhanced knowledgebase o f the impacts o f road
            investmentson the livelihoods of the population living within the area o f influence
            of the roads targeted for improvement, through the incorporationo f specific surveys
            and data collection at the time o f undertaking the resettlement completion reporting
            effort; and




                                                 6

       (f)   a training program buildinguponthose activities previously carried out under the
             Second Anhui Highway Project, for staff not only o f APCD but also o f city and
             county highway bureaus, and focusing on: (a) overseas training inroad management
             (inconjunction withthe activity insupport to AHAB inimplementingthe new
             CPMS); (b) overseas training on improved technologies for the use o f recycled
             pavement materials (inconjunction with the study on technological options for the
             recycling o f these materials); (c) road safety; (d) project management;
             (e) environmental supervision o f road construction; (f) environmental design o f
             scenic/ecological routes; (g) highway planning and design; (h) highway information
             systems management; and (i)     training to communities along the S322 road to be
             upgraded under the project on road safety and on starting up or developing
            productive activities to helpthem realize the benefits o f improved accessibility
             across the corridor.

E. Lessonslearnedand reflectedinthe projectdesign

20.    The proposedproject departs from previous Bank highway projects inChina with its
exclusive focus on the rehabilitationand maintenance o f the existing road network. Its design
buildson lessons learned from similar projects inother countries as well as from the
implementation o f the previous two transport projects inAnhui Province. The resulting lessons
assimilated for project design are summarized below:

       (a) Refocusing the sector agenda. Duringproject identification and preparationthe
            dialogue has emphasized the exchange o f views on road asset management issues,
             seekingto refocus the provincial strategies from one with a largeprominence on
            road construction to one that stresses management o f roads assets and the
            serviceability o f the network.

       (b) Gradual approach to shgt in sectorfocus. Changes inthe overall sector approach
            needto be built gradually as capacity and financing conditions constrainwhat can
            realistically be achieved inthe short term interms o f addressing maintenance and
            rehabilitation needs. Attention mustthen be given to key cost effective and
            appropriate solutions and to pilot initiatives that can create the demonstrationeffects
            that will encourage buildingupon those initiatives towards more encompassing
            shifts in sector approaches.

       (c)  The dejbition and design of the institutional strengthening subcomponents build
            upon the studies and subsequentactions carried forward under previous World Bank
            projects (see box below). By focusing on those critical activities that complement
            previous actions and inaddition have a potential to create a demonstration effect and
            further enhancekey capacities o fthe APCD inmanaging highway assets (and in
            providing technical leadership to county and local highway entities), the scope o f
            these subcomponents seeks also to ensure a strong ownership and commitment o f
            APCD incarrying out the studies on time and with the expected application o f their
            results. Given the progress in streamliningroad safety investments and (currently)
            addressing truck overloading, the new project refocuses on strengthening other road



                                                   7

              management skills, with an emphasis on maintenance programming, technologies,
              and contractual mechanisms.


   Institutional strengtheningactivitiesin previousWorld Bank projects
   The project has beenbuilt onthe previouseffortsby the Bank andother internationallendinginstitutes to
   strengthen Anhui's capacitiesindesign, planning,highway operation, roadmanagement, androadsafety.
   Particularly,underthe ongoing WorldBank SecondAnhuiHighwayProject, the Banksupportedthe APCD in:
   (a) appropriatemeasuresandpolicies to mitigatethe overloadingproblem; (b) carryingout roadsafety
                                       spot improvements); and(c       icalassistance onhighway
                                                                       ationandimplementationofthis
                                                                uchas highwaydesignstandards
   improvement, constructionquality, androadsafety.


         (d) Treatmentofproject contingencies. The first Anhui project was finishedwith about
               15% o f the loan funds un-disbursed,hence loan allocations for contingencies require
              a different treatment than other usedfunds to avoid provincial entities to pay
              commitment fees on large amounts o f funds that remain largely unuseduntil greater
              certainty i s reached inthe estimation o f the final costs o f the various components o f
              the project.

F. Alternatives considered and reasonsfor rejection

21.      The main alternative considered was the application o f a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp)
instead o f a more traditional lending approach. The former alternative was rejected by the client
primarily becausethis option would not suit their needs, reasons being (a) the low percentage o f
financing provided by the Bank - about 5% o f the total investment required for the rehabilitation
and maintenance program under the EFYP -implies that Bank's leverage on enforcing the
application o f specific policies to the broad provincial investment program i s very limited;
(b) some ofthe work under the broadrehabilitationand maintenance program has already been
done and some are ongoing. It i s difficult to have a consistent and solid impact on framework
strengthening with such a multi-phased complicated program; and (c) the selection o fthe 25
roads to be rehabilitated and improved under this Project is based on well-designed criteria such
as macro-level strategic plan o f provincial socio-economic development and road network
optimization, hence there i s no need for a more flexible program such as SWAp.

22.     Under the improvement component, analyses (and site visits) were undertaken to explore
the most adequate alignments inconsideration o f potential economic benefits and social and
environmental factors. Since the options were somewhat limitedgiventhat the improvements
were to be implemented largely within existing rights-of-way, the analysis o f alternatives often
involved the fine tuning o f specific segments that involve bypasses or new construction. A more
extensive description o f these analyses i s included inAnnex 4 and Annex 11.

111.     IMPLEMENTATION

 A. Partnershiparrangements(if applicable)

 23.     Though project preparation has been carried out with the leadershipof the APCD (and
 the technical support of its AHAB), it has also beencoordinated with abroaderspectrumof
 agencies involved inthe road sector inAnhui, including the Anhui Provincial Finance
 Department, andthe Provincial Development and Reform Commission. This coordination will
 be maintained during project implementationthrough the exchangeof views with these other
 provincial agencies inthe context of the supervision of project implementation.

 B. Institutionaland implementationarrangements

 24.     The APCD (through the AHAB), with the support of the Project Executing Office (PEO)
 that is currently supporting the implementation of the ongoing SecondAnhui Highway Project,
 will carry out the execution of the project. The proposedproject will be the third World Bank
 financed transport project inthe Anhui Province and under the responsibility of the APCD.

 25.     The PEO was establishedin 1997 within the APCD under the first Anhui Highway
 Project (1999-2005) and has beensatisfactorily conducting day-to-day management of the
 previous two Bank financed projects inAnhui. As a government organization, PEO has been
 authorized to implementthe project. The APCD has agreedto retain the PEO over the
 implementation period of the proposednew project, with staff composition and skills acceptable
 to the Bank. APCD will remain ultimately responsiblefor the monitoring of the execution of the
 project and ultimately responsiblefor its satisfactory implementation.

 26.     Sub-project Construction Management Offices (Sub-PCMOs) will be set up ineach city'
 where project investmentsare expectedto take place, for managementand supervision of the
 project civil works (both rehabilitation and improvement). These sub-PCMOs will be specially
 set up for management of the World Bank project but will draw from staff of the cities' highway
 bureaus. These bureaus are affiliated to the AHAB (though staffing issues needto be agreed
 upon with the city public authorities). They will be incharge of construction management, and
 APCD (through AHAB) will monitor their activities to ensure compliance with World Bank
 fiduciary and safeguardsrequirementsand those includedinthe legal agreements.The specific
 duties of each sub-PCMO will dependon the characteristicsofthe road sectionwithintheir
jurisdiction and, where needed, they will count with the support of the relevant specialists. They
 will report directly to the AHAB and the central PEO.

 27.     The APCD, through the PEO, and with support from the Project Construction
 Management Office of AHAB, will be responsiblefor the procurement of the civil works under
 the project. The maintenancepilot and technical assistance componentsofthe project will be
 directly under the responsibility of the PEO. A project management manual has beenprepared
 and adoptedby April 30, 2007, clarifying the responsibilities and reporting requirementsamong
 the PEO, PCMO, and Sub-PCMOs, inrespect of the procurement and supervision activities of
 the physical components ofthe project.

 7There are 17 cities (and prefectures) in Anhui Province. The project activities are located in 12 o f those cities.


                                                          9

C. Monitoringandevaluationof outcomes/results

28.      The assessmento fthe achievement o fthe project objective will be carried out through the
measurement o f outcome indicators, including the reduction inaverage freight and passenger
tariffs along a representative sample o f provincial and national road corridors, and intravel times
on the rehabilitated or improved roads, as shown inthe Results Framework (Annex 3).

29.      The results of the project will also be measured by another set o f intermediate outcome
indicators such as (a) increased traffic volumes on the corridors to be upgraded or rehabilitated;
(b) reduction inaccident rates; (c) progressinthe completion ofthe milestones for the
implementation o f the upgraded CPMS; (d) application o f alternative contractual mechanisms for
road maintenance; (e) percentage o f APCD budget allocated to maintenance and rehabilitation;
(f)implementation o f enhanced environmental manuals; (g) the number o f initiatives with the
application of recycling approaches to the rehabilitationo f the pavement; and (h) the quality and
effectiveness o f the training program inenhancing knowledge and application o f road
management approaches through specialized training and study tours. For the latter, specific
evaluation forms based on a format agreed upon with the Bank will be provided to participants
upon completion o fthe training or study tour and will be used for assessment o f the impact o f
these training activities on the knowledge and professional development o f the participants.

30.      For the road improvement and rehabilitationcomponents, duringproject preparation,
APCD ha collected the baseline values reported inAnnex 3, and provided estimates based on a
sample of provincial roads. These roads were selected from those programmed to be improved
under the project. APCD will collect, annually duringthe project implementation and untilthe
preparation o f the Project's ImplementationCompletion Report (ICR), the selected results
indicators for the corridors along the project roads (travel times, traffic volumes, and freight
rates) from a sample o f the improved or rehabilitatedroads.

3 1.     Inaddition, as part ofthe project implementation evaluation, the APCD will collect
relevant socio-economic information as collected inthe socioeconomic surveys for resettlement
planningfrom the communities inthe area influenced by the road improvements. This
information will be usedto assess the impacts of the implementation o f the road improvement
component on the socioeconomic conditions and the productive activities o fthe affected
communities.

D. Sustainability

32.      The proposed project represents the first o f the recent highway projects in China without
a major tolled expressway as part o f its components. The less-complex physical characteristics
o f the investmentsreduce the engineering risks and provide a higher probability o f ensuring high
quality constructionstandards and completion o f schedule. Supervision efforts will also be less
onerous-hence     the use of domestic consultants to performthis activity.

33.      The long-term sustainability ofthe road assets, however, will dependon the designo f a
comprehensive maintenance strategy and program as well as the effective and timely
implementation of the programmedmaintenance activities. Support i s provided under the



                                                  10

project to improve both the collection o f data to measure the condition o f road assets and the
mechanisms used to incorporate the data into the revamped APCD management systems-
through the implementation o f a new (enhanced) CPMS. The goal o f these improvements i s the
enhancement o f the knowledge base in order to improve the maintenance planning decisions.
Similarly the pilot on maintenance by contract seeks to instillmore efficient maintenance
practices towards an enhanced sustainability o f the road investments.

34.     Roadmaintenance budgetsinAnhui are planned for an average 8% annual increase
duringthe next five year plan. However, an analysis carried duringproject preparation has
shown that the budget growth needs to be higher ifmaintenance and rehabilitation requirements
based on the actual road network condition are to be met towards improving the overall
condition and serviceability o f the network. Infact, during 2006, the first year o fthe EFYP, has
seen a substantial increased to the amounts allocated to maintenance and rehabilitation, from
45% to 57% o f AHAB resources, with an increase o f about 34% inthe amount allocated per
kilometer o f (national and provincial) highway. On the basis o f a preliminary analysis o f
networkneeds, the increase inthe percentage o f AHAB resources would needto be upped
slightly more (by another 4% points) and sustained to ensure a steady good condition o f the road
network. Inthis respect, a loan covenant requiring annual reviews of APCD's road maintenance
budget and plan has beenagreed upon. The goal o fthe reviewwill be to assess the
appropriateness o f the allocation o f resources betweennetwork development and preservation.

35.     Nonetheless, the fundamental problem lies not so much on the overall funding (as shown
by the fiscal capacity assessment inAnnex 8 which concluded with a sound rating for the
province), but rather on the need for a more rational and scientific approach to road network
management and maintenance. Hencethe project focus i s on providing APCD with the proper
tools to better assess the linkages betweenactual network condition and budget allocation
requirements. Another loan covenant relates to the timetable o f actions for the installation o f the
enhanced CPMS and the gradual improved analysis and forecast o f roadpreservationneeds
(further supporting the assessment o fthe budgetallocation to be reviewed annually as explained
inthe previous paragraph).

36.     The types o froads to be improved or rehabilitated underthe proposedproject, with only a
few tolled (and with tolls set a low levels giventhat they are at or below Class II), be
                                                                                      must
framed ina different dynamic interms o f the ultimate financial or fiscal sustainability o fthe
investmentscompared to expressway investments with a secure (at least partially) stream o f toll
income. The analysis o f the overall fiscal framework at the provincial level (Annex 8) and the
implications for the road sector exhibit a robust overall financial framework within the
foreseeable future. This provides a positive outlook for the sustainability o f the investments
granted, as indicated inthe previous paragraph, key strengthening actions are implementedin
APCD's road management approaches and systems.

E. Critical risks and possible controversial aspects

37.     The APCD and its units-including      the AHAB, more directly responsible for this
project-have    maintained a good implementation track record for the Bank transport projects in
Anhui. The FirstAnhui Provincial Highway Project was completedonAugust 31,2005, andthe



                                                  11

ICR ratedthe project implementation as satisfactory. The ongoing SecondAnhui Highway
Project, with about 60% of the loan funds disbursed, is progressing well. Under both projects,
the APCD showed a robust capacity to develop the high-grade highway network and
simultaneously implement aprovincialroad development program. This experience
substantiates a reduced implementation risk. Furthermore, the proposedproject does not present
the engineeringcomplexities of other highway projects because it does not include construction
of new expressways. Nonetheless, given that the unit of APCD-AHAB-that                      will be more
closely related to the implementation ofthe physical components of the project has more limited
experiencewith World Bank-financedprojects, severalrisks are rated as medium. The following
table shows the various risks associatedwith the project. The overall project risk i s medium.

*Under the previoustwo Bank projects, APCD has developedin-housecapacity to implement, superviseand
monitor environmentaland social safeguards. For environmentalsafeguards, the APCD has retainedthe Shanghai
Ship and Shipping Design Institute,which is quite familiar with Bank's safeguards policiesthrough EA preparation
for previous Bank projects includingSecondAnhui Highway, HubeiXiao-XiangExpressway,and Hubei Shi-Man
Expressway Projects. The APCD has also engaged East China Survey and DesignInstituteto assist inthe
resettlementplanningand implementation. This institutehas a longhistory of engagement with World Bank
operations and has accumulatedmuchexperience and expertise dealing with resettlement issues.

 A. Economicand financial analyses

 Economic

 40.     Economic sustainability of theproposedproject. According to the latest analyses that
 updatethe results of the feasibility study, the EIRRofthe project is about 27.0%. This estimate
 i s based on the following main assumptions:

         (a) No diversion of traffic from railway lines, with benefits focusing on those relatedto
               existing roadtraffic and a generatedtraffic equal to 10% of normal traffic;

         (b) Traffic growth ratesthat start at 5.1% until2012 andthendecrease to 3.3% to 2020
              and 1.7%to 2030; and


                                                  14

         (c)  Conversion factors mostly reflect scarcity o f skilled labor and imported materials.

41.      Overall the project appears economically feasible based solely on the transport benefits
along the road corridors. Inaddition, the project roads are either part o f the road network
connecting the coastal provinces (Jiangsu and Zhejiang), located inthe poorer mountainous
regions, or the local bottlenecWmissing link segments. The investments will enhance the
accessibility o f the villages and towns along the areas o f influence o f the roads. The possible
additional benefits from enhanced access to social services, which are harder to quantify, would
provide higher rates o f economic returns.

42.      The economic evaluation covered two project components that account for all the project
physical costs: (a) rehabilitation o f 13 roads (18 segments, 885.6 km) and (b) improvement of 4
roads (7 segments, 318.1 km). The principal measured benefits o f the project are savings in
vehicle operating costs, time savings to vehicle occupants and enhanced road safety by using the
Highway Designand Maintenance Standard Model (HDM-4).

43.      The proposed project roads were selected from 50 candidate roads inthe province. The
main selection criteria were based on location factors and on pavement conditions, such as roads:
(a) located in areas with prevalence o f poverty and/or with low accessibility, (b) low technical
standards, (c) adjacent to Jiangsu or Zhejiang provinces with low traffic capacity and hightraffic
volume (over 12,000 vehicles per day), (d) with pavements badly damaged with traffic o f over
1,000 vehicles per day, (e) with missinglinks or major physical bottlenecks, and (f) reduced
environmental and resettlement impacts.

44.     The estimated overall EIRRfor the project, usingthe HDM-4 model, is 27.0%. The EIRR
for the rehabilitationroads and the improvement roads are 28.2% and 26.0%, respectively. The
overall economic Net Present Value (NPV), based on a 12% discount rate, i s estimated at RMB
3,958.4 million, o f which the rehabilitation roads are estimated to contribute RMB 1,935.0
million and the improvement roads are estimated to contribute RMB 2,023.4 million. An
analysis o f the evaluation results and a description o f the method usedto derive them are
provided inAnnex 10 and are summarized as follows:

Financial

45.     Financial viability of theproposedproject. Manyproject roads are toll free. For the toll
roads, the toll charges are set on the low side becausemost o fthe roads are Class I1andunder.
Financialevaluation i s focused on fiscal impact analysis. The financial data confirmedthe
availability o f sufficient counterpart fhds andthe capacity o fthe APCD to finance the project as
well as the future maintenance and operating expenses o fthe project roads. All the indicators show
that the fiscal impact andrisksare modest. The total capital requiredfor the entire project, for
example, representsonly 3.9% o fthe total revenue o fAPCD duringthe constructionperiod (2007-


                                                   15

2011). And, the future annual maintenance andoperation expenseso fthe entire project roads are
lessthan 1.5% o f its annualbudgetedmaintenance expenditures. Inaddition, the total financial
obligations o fthe project (principal and interest for domestic and the IBRDloans) for 2012-the
first loanrepayment year-constitutes areasonable 19.1% oftotal budgetedprincipalandinterest
repayment o fthe APCD inthat year. And, it i s estimated that the total APCD budget(2006-
2015) constitutes only about 8-12% o f the overall the government budget o f Anhui province.
These low financial ratios indicate that the project presentsa very modest financial risk with respect
to: (a) the availability of resources to cover the project cost; (b) the maintenance and operating
needs, (c) the loan service requirements for the project roads, and (d) the financial burdensto the
province. A more extensive assessmentis provided inAnnexes 8 and 10.

B. Technical

46.      The project will include the following two civil work components:

ComDonentA - Rehabilitation of 890 km National and Provincial Roads.

47.      This component will support the provincial rehabilitationand maintenance program from
2007-2010 underthe EFYP. The Bank contribution will help finance eligible investments under
the rehabilitationcomponent o f the program. A list o f 18 segments to be rehabilitated, for about
890 km, has beenevaluated and found acceptable inthe context o fthe province-wide program o f
the roadnetwork rehabilitation.

48,      The interventions include primarilyrehabilitationo f damaged road sections and
structures, together with reconstruction o f pavements on the existing roads. The existing bridges,
which have deteriorated, will be reinforced or rehabilitated. Defects inthe existing sub-grade are
to be identifiedand repaired before overlaying the pavement. Necessary drainage and protection
works are to be provided inorder to minimize premature road deterioration.

49.      Road safety issueshave been addressed inthe designs. A safety-audit exercise, following
the Ministryof Construction(M0C)-sponsored programo fhighway safety audit engineering,
has beenapplied to review the safety-related elements inthe designs. Necessary safety facilities
have been provided inthe designto mitigate accident risks. Additional measures have been
taken into account to mitigate the impacts o f higher vehicles speeds with the improvement inthe
condition o f the pavements after rehabilitation.

ComponentB - Im-provement/UDgradingof 320 km Key National and Provincial Roads.

50.      This component consists o f improvementhpgrading o f seven key national andprovincial
roads located inthe central-eastern and southeastern areas o f the Province for a total lengthof
about 320 km. These improvements or upgrades will include widening and optimizing the
geometric features o f the existing road following the same alignment, with specific bypasses in
built-upareas (inorder to minimize resettlement actions), or with short segments o fnew
alignments in some cases to avoid hard topographical conditions and to complete missing
segments.




                                                    16

5 1.    Alternative analyseshave been conductedon two roads (S3 11and S322), which involve
specific segments of new construction, with an attempt at optimizingthe functionality of the road
alignment, reducing overall construction costs and minimizingthe amount of new construction.

52.     Geological investigations have beenconducted, and necessarytreatment methods have
beenidentifiedinthe design. The biddingdocumentswill be preparedbasedon detailed designs.
At appraisal, a review ofwork quantities and cost estimates, basedon these detailed designswas
conductedto ensure that they reflect more precise marketestimatesand will reducethe future
amounts of work variations.

53.     Roadsafety issues have beenaddressed inthe designs ofthis component as well, and a
safety-audit exercise, following the MOC-sponsored program of highway safety audit
engineering, has also been applied to review the safety-relatedelements inthe designs of the
improvement works. Attention has beengiven to existing high accident locations, which were
identifiedat the design stage, andnecessary treatment measures have beenprovided inthe
design. Appropriate safety facilities have beenprovided inthe design to mitigate crash risks.

C. Fiduciary

54.     Financial Management. An assessment was conductedof the adequacy of the project
financial management systemof the project. The assessment, based on guidelines issuedby the
Financial ManagementSector Board on November 3,2005, concluded that the project meets
minimumBank financial management requirements, as stipulated inBP/OP 10.02. The project
will maintain financial managementarrangementsthat are acceptableto the Bank and that, as
part ofthe overall arrangements that the borrower has inplace for implementing the operation,
provide reasonableassurance that the proceedsof the loan are usedfor the purposesfor which
the loan was granted. Financial managementrisk is the riskthat World Bank loan will not be
used for the purposesintendedand is a combination of country, sector and project specific risk
factors. The financial management (FM) risk rating proposedfor this project is modest.

55.     The loan proceeds will be disbursed from Anhui Provincial Finance Bureau(APFB) to
APCD's PEO, and thento AHAB, for AHAB to further disburse to sub-PCMOs invarious
prefectures. Since this funds-flow arrangement involves several disbursement layers, an efficient
cooperationamong all concernedparties will be critical for timely disbursement. With this
purpose, the detailed disbursementprocedureshave been documentedina financial management
manual submittedto the Bank on May 15,2007, and adopted by APCD on that same date.

56.     Retroactive financing will be available for this project inthe amount of US$20 million
for payments made under any of the components of the project prior to the signing of the loan
and project agreementsand after July 1,2007. The works undertakenduring that period will
needto comply with the fiduciary requirementsfor the entire project. No outstanding audits or
audit issues exist with any of the implementing agencies involved inthe proposedproject.

57.     Procurement. A procurement capacity assessment of the implementing agencies, PEO of
APCD and PCMO of AHAB, was carried out during the pre-appraisal mission from February 7-




                                                 17

9,2007. The assessment concluded that the overall procurement risks o f the project are
consideredaverage.

58.     Boththe PEO and PCMO have committed to allocate adequate resources including staff
having procurement experience inprevious Bank financed Anhui Highway Iand I1projects to
implement the project. An action plan to strengthen the procurement capacity o f the
implementing agencies has beendiscussed and agreed. This includes selection o f qualified
procurement agents, provision o f procurement training workshops for the relevant staff o f the
implementing agencies, drafting PCMO's internal procedures for procurement review and
clearance, cost variations review and clearance, as well as defining respective procurement
functions and responsibilitieso f PEO, PCMO and Sub-PCMOs. A procurement plan was agreed
between APCD and the Bank task team, which is attached to Annex 9. The APCD will ensure
that the project is implemented inaccordance with the "Guidelines on Preventing and Combating
Fraud and Corruption inProjects Financed by IBRDLoans and IDA Credits and Grants," dated
October 15, 2006.

59.     A more detailed summary ofthe assessmentand the procurement arrangement are
provided inAnnex 9.

D. Social

60.     A socioeconomic survey was conducted inthe project areas duringthe project
preparation. Social impacts o f the project are mainly related to the land acquisition and structure
relocation underthe road improvement component. The APCD has completed the resettlement
planning and prepared four RAPSto address those impacts. No resettlement impacts are
expected under the road rehabilitationcomponent. To address any possible such impacts during
construction, a resettlement policy framework has also been prepared inline with relevant
Chinese and World Bank policies. No communities with minority nationalities were found to be
impacted by the project.

61.     Detailed impact inventory and census surveys show that the road improvement
component would require 6,549 muo f land (436 ha), including 4,561 mu (304 ha) o f cultivated
lands, affecting the lands o f about 2,875 households (encom assing 10,408 people). The project
would also require house relocation with a total o f 3 1,194 m ,affecting 680 people in 175
                                                               'I
households. About 20 small-business shops will be affected as well. These impacts will be
further confirmed whenthe engineering constructiondrawings are completed.

62.     Inline with Chinese laws, regulations and World Bank Operational Policy OP 4.10 on
Involuntary Resettlement, detailed livelihood rehabilitation and resettlement planshave been
developed. The overall strategy i s a combination o f land-for-land measures and cash payment
option. Redistribution o fthe remainingvillage land i s the primary measure. Invillages where
land loss i s marginal and farmers prefer cash compensation, cash compensation will be provided
as an option. The planswere developed with the affected villagers based on village resources
potential analysis, their willingness and capabilities for various options. The 175 households to
be relocated are planning to move withintheir current villages. The households beingrelocated
will be responsible for their own house constructionwith the compensation fund and allowances.



                                                 18

Affected facilities will be compensated at reconstructioncost and will be reconstructed by the
governmental departments of the location o fthe owner. All affected shops will be compensated
and helped to be reestablished nearby.

63.      The RAPs describe the resettlement implementation arrangements. The APCD is in
charge o f the implementation o f the resettlement program. A multi-level resettlement
organization has beenestablished for the implementation o f the project, including resettlement
offices at provincial, municipal, county and township levels. Their respective responsibilities
and functions are detailed inthe RAPs. An independent monitor will be appointed for the
implementation o f the resettlement program. All resettlement will be completed before civil
works start. Detailed implementation schedules are included inthe RAPs. The total resettlement
cost i s estimated to be RMB 165 million (US$21million). All RAPs and the RPFhave been
disclosed locally. They have beenplaced incity public libraries and local project offices. Their
availability has been announced inlocal newspaper.

E. Environment

64.      The project i s classified as Category A due to the new construction segments being
designed as part o f the improvement o f subproject S322 on the Taohuatan-Tangkou road, which
will traverse a mountainous area o f highscenic value with tourism potential. FullEIAshave
beenprepared for all the S322 and6 road improvement subprojects; anda simplified EIA for all
the 18 road rehabilitation subprojects.

65.      Based on the 7 individual full EIAs and the simplified EIAs, an IntegratedEnvironmental
Assessment Report inEnglishhas beenprepared for the entire roadprogram under guidelines
and table o f contents agreed with the Bank. The EAP Safeguards Secretariat approved this
approach to the Environmental Assessment (EA) and translation into English.All environmental
management actions for construction activities are included ina comprehensive set o f
standardized environmental specifications that will be part o f bidding documents and contracts.

66.      The road infrastructure to be improved or rehabilitatedwill be mostly locatedalongside
the existing alignments requiringonly the expansion ofthe right ofway (ROW) andacquisition
o f additional land. Most o f the impacts identified will be easily managed through sound
engineering design and construction practices. The areas o f influence along the project roads are
largely developed. There are no natural habitats or critical natural habitats along the existing or
future right of ways. However, there still remain some patches o f native vegetation, especially
along S322 that still harbor some native species albeit without any significant biodiversity value.
There i s no evidence o fpaleontological or archeological resources along the corridor. And there
are no minority nationalities inthe area o f influence o f the project.

67.      The APCD has prepared a comprehensive and detailed draft EMP inaccordance with
Bank policy. The EMP addresses all potential environmental and social issues of concern and
proposes adequate mitigation measures for each negative impact identifiedas well as measures
for enhancing each identifiedpositive impact. The EMP includes a summary chart where all the
problems encountered and proposed mitigation and enhancement measures are mentioned, and
their location is provided inalignment sheets for all road improvements and new construction

                     Annex 1: Countryand Sector or ProgramBackground
              CHINA: Anhui HighwayRehabilitationand ImprovementProject

RoadSector Developmentin China

1,      Since the early 1990s, the economy of China has moved from a centrally planned
environment to one which is more commercialized and competitive and with ahigh degree of
openness. These changes have ledto the rapid growth inpassenger and freight traffic, putting
heavy demands on the transport infrastructure. Inresponseto these demands, all modes of
transport have seen their networks expanded. Giventhe previous underinvestment inthe sector,
since the mid 1990sthe country has seen arapid increaseinthe rate of construction oftransport
infrastructure, particularlyroads. By 2005 the total road network was roughly 1.8million km,
with about 41,000 kmof expressways and about 38,000 kmof high-grade (Class I)                      highways in
operation. As a result, amongthe surface modes, roadtransport has seen its share grow from
about 45% to 60% interms of passenger-kmand from 24% to 30% interms of ton-km (not
considering pipelinesor waterways). Complementedby the railway and waterways networks,
over the last 15 years, China has developed one of the most extensive transportation systems in
the world.

2.      Inthe road network, the national and provincial roads, linkingrural roadsto expressways,
have become a key for facilitating the continuous economic and social development of the
country. As shown inthe table below, by 2005 the total length of the national and provincial
roads (excluding expressways) was about 325,000 km, representingapproximately 18% of the
total road network. The average annual daily traffic on the national and provincialroads
amountsto 7,458 vehicles per day.

                  * The length does not include the kilometers of the expressway network.


3.      The rapid growth intraffic volumes on national and provincialroads (with, as an
example, a 9.7% increaseinaverage annual daily traffic in2005 compared to 2004) requires a
rigorous and sustainableroad asset managementprogram to maintain and improve the network.
This is essential for promoting the urbanization process, strengthening linkages between
developed and lagging provinces, facilitating the distribution of economic opportunities,
stimulating the adjustment of industrial and labor structures to increase income, and more
generally enhance accessibility to education, health care, and employment opportunities.

The Anhui Province

4.      Anhui Province, with about 65 millionpeople, is one ofthe most populousand densest
provinces of China. Its density-of about 460 persons per km2-is                      more thanthree times the
national average. The province is crossedby the Yangtze River and Huai River, and is adjacent

to six provinces. Comparedto its more successful neighborsto the east and north-Zhejiang,
Jiangsu, and Shandong-Anhui             has laggedmarkedly insocio-economic development, with a
GDP per capita aroundone thirdthe average level of those three provinces and areducedlife
expectancy (73 vs. 75 years). Comparedto those to the west and south-Hubei,                    Henan, and
Jiangxi-Anhui       has more similar-though slightly lower-socio-economic indicators. Within
Anhui, there is great regional disparity, with most ofthe wealth concentratedinindustrial regions
close to the Yangtze River.'

5.       Presently, Anhui province encompasses 17 provincial-level cities, five county-level
cities, and 56 counties. The main advantages of the Anhui province include: (a) abundant water
resources; (b) widely spread tourism resourceswith unique characteristics; and (c) abundant
mineralresourcesandreserves. At present, an industrial systemhas beenformed, centeredby the
energy andthe raw material industriesand supported by the manufacturing industry. Basedon
different features of each area, five economic zones are formed inAnhui province. However,
Anhui province is still heavily dependant on agriculture whereby rural population accounts for
79% of its total population (22% percentagepoints higher than the national average).

Total provincial GDP reached 481.3 billionRMB, and achieveda year-on-year growth of 12.5%
in2006. The Province hastwenty national-level poverty countiesandtenprovincial-level
poverty counties, accounting for 49.2% oftotal counties inthe Province. In2004, the total poor
population inrural areas was 1.42million, representinga proportion (comparedto the total
number of poor inChina) that is slightly higher than the one that would correspondto the
provincial population percentage.

7.       To speed up balanceddevelopment, Anhui Province decidedto implement the so-called
"861 Action Plan", Le., constructing eight major industrial bases and six key development
programs. The eight industrial bases refer to processingand manufacturebase, raw material
industry base, chemical industry base, energy and coal base, high-tech fundamental industry
base, high-quality and safe agricultural products production, processingand supply base and
national famous tourism base; andthe six key programs refer to anti-flood andpublic security
program, accessibility program, information program, geological program, credit program and
intelligence program.

8.       The maineconomic goals during the EFYP period include: (a) annual growth rate of
provincialGDP exceeds 10%; (b) structure of three industries (primary, manufacturing, services)
shall be adjustedto 12:45:43 (from 19:45:36, in2004), while the employment structure inthree
industriesshall be adjustedto 40:25:35, urbanizationratio shall exceed42%; and (c) annual
increaserate of disposable income of urbanresidence and farmers' net annual income per capital
would exceed 7%, reaching 12,000 RMB and 3,800 RMBrespectively. The economic growth in

9Agricultural activitiesin Anhui vary accordingto the climate zones that the province crosses. North of the Huai
He river wheat and sweet potatoesare grown, while southofthat river it is rice andwheat. Natural resources of
Anhui also include iron in Ma'anshan, coal in Huainan, and copper inTongling. There are industriesrelatedto
these natural resources (e.g.,steel industry at Ma'anshan). One ofthe famous Anhui-based corporations is the
automobile company Chery which is based in Wuhu.

Anhui is forecastedto remain steady over the next decade, with growth ratesbetween7% and
10%.

9.        Anhui's geographic location-right   to the west of Shanghaiand Hangzhou metropolitan
areas-makes       the province anatural crossingarea for the interchangeof industrial productsand
technology betweenthe more developed coastalprovinces andthose less prosperous to the center
and west. Inline with the Central Government's initiative of "Rise of Central China" which is
part of the EFYP, defined as crucial for a coordinated andharmonized development between
eastern, central and western areas, the Anhui Governmenthas elaboratedits own strategy of
"Development to the East", with an aim at expediting the incorporation of the various regions of
Anhui with the comparatively more affluent regions ofthe Yangtze Delta, includingthose poorer
areas (inthe north and south of Anhui). Transport is one of the priorities inthat development
strategy.

Surface Transport Sector Overview

10.       Highways. By the end of year 2006, the total lengthof highways inAnhui province had
reached 71,214 km, within which national andprovincial highways representedabout 16%.
(Village roads amountedto another 75,400 km, mostly consisting of Class IV or unclassified
roads. By highway classes, the network includes 1,747 km of expressway and about 9,500 km of
Class Ior I1roads. Hence, the total lengthof highways with Class I1or above accounts for about
13%of the total highway length(excluding village roads). The table below summarizes the
length ofthe roads by class and administrative categories.

Sector Issues and Government Strategies

13.      Two main overarching issues can be highlighted for the road sector at the provincial
level:

          (a)   Roadnetwork responsiveness.

                (i)  Current statistics on highways show that only about 13% oftotal lengthis Class
                     I1or above and have high-standardpavements. These figures suggest that
                     although the existing network of Anhui Province represents a sizable network
                     interms ofkilometers per inhabitant, the averagelevelof service is
                     comparatively low given the low technical standardsof the road network.
                     Comparedto the six surrounding provinces, the density of the network (kmper
                     population) is above the average, while the percentage of pavedroads (as a
                     proxy for the quality of the infrastructure) is the lowest." This results in
                     shortcomings of the existing highway network inmeeting future transport
                     demand.

                (ii)Inaddition,thenetworkexhibits:(i)               low class connections on the east-bound
                     corridors; (ii)   poor quality of pavement and limitedprotection against disaster;
                     and (iii) unbalanceddistribution of network across the regions inAnhui
                     Province. The Government of Anhui has advanced a plan for upgrading and
                     reconstructing existing national and provincial trunk highway network to
                     enhance the level of service andtraffic capacity, while minimizing the needs
                     for land acquisition. This plan-which              i s part of the national EFYP-involves
                     several concurrent actions that build upon the progress made inthe last few
                     years,I2 with highway and waterway investments for about US$13 billion, as
                     follows:

                           Expansionof the expresswaynetwork to the Yangtze Delta and to regional
                           central cities inthe Province, reaching a total length of 3,500 km(from
                           about 1,500 kmcompletedat the end of 2005), realizing the goals of
                           (a) three-hour travel from east to west and six-hour from north to south in
                           the province; (b) roundtrip onthe same day from provincial-governed
                           cities to Hefei; and (c) expressways accessibleto 90% of cities and one-
                           hour trip to nearby expressway for all counties.

                           The national andprovincial trunk highway network will connectwith the
                           expressway network, forming a mutual support layout, which could help
                           support and guarantee the provincial macro-economic development. The
                           "5 15 Engineering" planincludesthe rehabilitation and improvement of
                           about 5,700 km of national and provincial trunk highways, with about

realize rapid growth of transport infrastructure scale, substantially forming a comprehensivetransport system framed
by trunk railways, expressways, main navigation waterways and important airports.

                              US$1.25 billion allocated to improving road geometries, structural
                              strength, and pavement roughness. Thisprogram seeks to increase the
                              level o f service o f the road infrastructure while minimizing land
                              acquisition.

          (b) Roadmaintenance approaches

                (i)    Inparallel to that investment program, highway maintenance inthe province
                       requires strengthening,with enhanced methodologies and tools for the
                       programmingo f preventive and periodic maintenance activities and
                       improvements to the implementation o f those activities. Although the APCD
                       claims that about 80% o f the roadnetwork i s ingood condition, the data upon
                       which this figure i s based remains unreliable. This assessment i s indeed
                       optimistic and needs to be adjusted for several reasons:

                       0      looking at the pavement which i s traditionally the most important element
                              when speakingo f road condition, some data from roughness surveys show
                              IRIvalues which are more indicative of fair condition than good condition
                              (while confirming that the "excellent" and "good" ratings can be merged
                              into "good", for about 21YOo f the sample); and

                              APCD's current plan i s to improvehehabilitate about 5,700 km o f
                              national/provincial (N+P) roads, that is. 52% o f the N+P network length;
                              this would suggestthat at least 52% oftheN+P network is inless than fair
                              condition.




                                                                           Length        Percent
                                          Condition                         Oun)           (YO)
                       Good:      No capital works needs                    2,354         21%
                       Fair:      Needperiodic maintenance                  2,943         27%

13  As part of that strategy, the Provincial Governmentalso intendsto speed up investmentsfor enhancingthe
condition of rural roads. The constructionprogramof "bitumen (cement) road accessibleto every village" was
started in 2006. By 2010, it is expectedto form arural roadnetwork which connects with national and provincial
trunk highways, complies with rural socio-economic development, and meets living and production demands of
rural populations. Investmenton rural roads is expectedto reach US$2.25billion, through support to the
construction and improvementof about 60,000 km ofrural roads and realizing the goal of 80% of administrative
villages having access to a pavedroad.


                                                          25

15.     The condition surveys on which basis the above estimates are made cover only a subset o f
the network composed o f about 12,000 kmofthe most trafficked routes and on which APCD are
focusing their efforts. Inaddition, data collection and other procedures are mostly manual and,
although thorough, they lack some key factors that are useful for decision-making on
maintenance and rehabilitationneeds. There i s no systematic use o f the road data bank or o fthe
current CPMS for operational purposes. APCD i s aware o fthe importance o f maintenance and
seeks to establish improved road management and maintenance approaches, alongside those
currently being implementedfor the control o f overloading, more efficient toll collection
mechanisms, and a wide-rangingroad safety program.

16.     The sources o f highway maintenance funds inAnhui province mainly consist o f road
maintenance fee, toll charge, motor vehicle fee, and bank loans. Analyses o f maintenance
activities and funding inrecent years illustrate the main shortcomings that have impeded a
satisfactory outcome inthis area: (a) funding for maintenance not in accordance with the actual
needs; and (b) lack o f rational maintenance strategy. Although the maintenance budget has
increased steadily at about 6% per year duringthe last five years and i s planned to be sustained at
an elevated level inthe next five years, periodic maintenance was carried out on less than 5% of
the network, far from beingadequateto keep upwiththe actual condition ofthe network as
assessedabove. To investigate the implications o f this situation for the province, an application
based on HDM-4 called RONET (Road Network EvaluationTools) was runto assess the overall
performance o f the road sector inAnhui. Based on the current condition and a selected level o f
road standards for different parts o fthe network, the model calculates road works distribution,
benefits to road users and to society, consequences to asset values and road condition, and the
corresponding budgets required for types o f works for different parts o f the network. (Details o f
the RONET assessmentare available inthe project files.) The mainfindings o fthe exercise
were as follows:

        (a)  As far as the overall network is concerned, the required expenditures for the next 5
             years, under the "desirable standard'' which minimizes total society costs and
             eliminates the rehabilitationbacklog, are around two times larger than the currently
             planned expenditures for rehabilitation, periodic maintenance and routine
             maintenance (the range depends on the way the sample data are extrapolated to
             cover the entire network).

        (b) With the currently plannedexpendituresfor rehabilitation, periodic maintenance and
             routine maintenance for the next 5 years, the network would be kept more or less at
             its current condition (that is, with an average IRI of 6.9).

17.     These findings are consistent with the shortcomings identifiedpreviously. The
assessment i s based on a macro-evaluationo f the networkdone with limited data; therefore, it
provides only indicative figures that should be corroborated with a study with more refineddata
and evaluation tools. It i s expected that such enhanced network evaluation will be part o f the
new CPMS outputs. Attachment A details the plan for the installation and implementation o f the
revamped CPMS.

Overallfinancialframework

18.     The overview o fthe fiscal framework o fthe Anhui Provincial Government i s summarized
inAnnex 8. Itshows that investments inroadshave amountedto about 4% oftheprovincial GDP
over the last three years and to around 25% o fprovincial expenditures. The analysis shows that the
Anhui highway sector exhibits apositive trendinrevenue generation with a sustainable financial
path. Furthermore, provincial indebtednesslevels appear manageable for the foreseeable future.
This favorable context will allow the APCD to face the increased requirements inroad
maintenance and rehabilitation, and better manage the transition towards a more balanced
allocation o f resources between road network development and preservation.

the Anhui Government's own strategies andinterventions. Specifically, the project seeks to
support; (a) the upgrading o f road conditions across the network, through the rehabilitation and
upgrading o f key segments o f the national and provincial roads; and (b) the enhancement of
management capacities at APCD,particularly inthe areas of programming maintenance
interventions on the road network and on the mechanisms to undertake those interventions.

                     StrengtheningRoadManagementinAnhuiProvince

Introduction

1.       AHAB has drafted a proposal and an action planon the Application and Strengtheningof
pavement management inAnhui province. To achieve their goals there is a needto: (a) provide
an effective pavement management system (PMS) for monitoring and managing roads; and
(b) ensure that the systemis provided with appropriate and timely data. The project proposesto
achievethis by implementing the new version of the CPMS with appropriate data collection.

Overview of the CPMS

2.       The CPMS was firstly developed inearly 1990sunder the support of the MOC, and the
early version was implemented inmost of Chinese Provincial highway administration bureaus
during 1991-2000.Since 2000, further developments of the CPMS were undertaken,
incorporating the results of severalnational key researchprojects. More recently, the latest
version of CPMS N H K P is an integratedroad managementsystem composedof more than ten
individualmodules providinga full-process computerized road managementtool.

3.       The newversion ofthe CPMS has an integrateddatabase which is usedfor managing
inventory data and condition dataof different components of roads, including: (a) road geometry;
(b) sub-grade, shoulder, slope and side ditch; (c) pavement; (d) bridges and tunnels; (e) traffic
facility; (0virescence; (g) right-of-way information; and (h) traffic flow and composition. The
Network PavementManagement Module is the key module of the CPMS which allows
undertaking the following assessments/analyses: (a) pavement performance assessment;
(b) maintenanceneeds analysis; (c) maintenancecost prediction; (d) maintenance investment-
effectivenessanalysis; (e) budgets assignment and project selection; and (0maintenance
scheduling. With a cycle cost analysis (including project cost, deferred maintenance costs,
operation costs androad user costs, etc.), the Economic Evaluation module can further provide
the economic evaluation results for aproposedmaintenanceprogram.

4.       This new version is being installed inseveral provinces with the assistance of the system
developer, the ResearchInstituteof Highway (RIOH).

PMS in Anhui

5.      Considerationson the use of pavement management systems are not newto Anhui. The
CPMS was introduced inAnhui in 1995/96and resourceswere provided for its implementation
inthe province, butthis was discontinued in2000/01 becauseof difficulties relatedto:

        (a) shortcomings inthe initial version ofthe program (no user-friendly interface, extent
             of datato be collected, applications mostly at project level and not network analysis,
             consideration only of asphalt pavements whereas cement concrete pavements form
             part of about 40% o f the network);

        (b) the highdemandinresourcesinterms of manpower and equipment for data surveys;



                                                28

        (c)  a decentralization drive between year 2000 and 2003, duringwhich period AHAB
             had very minimal leverage on road network administration; and

        (d) the emphasis put on new constructionand network development.

6.      As a result, the CPMS is no longer beingusedeffectively inAnhui and the preparation of
maintenance and rehabilitationprograms i s made on the basis of multi-criteria analysis based on
sample data. Technical data are provided from annual road condition surveys entrusted to the
Anhui Highway EngineeringTestingand InspectionCenter that includes roughness, surface
distress and deflection measurements taken on sample sections. As for traffic surveys, they are
carried out routinely by the local maintenance stations and centralized by AHAB. At present,
there is no computerized management system or informationplatform to integrate the road
condition and traffic survey data. The two sets o f data are submittedto the planning division o f
AHAB for reference inits decision making process. AHAB is fully committed to improve this
situation and acquire modernroad management tools, with full support from the project. The
planto achieve this objective is summarized inthe attachment to Annex 4.

                               Annex 4: DetailedProjectDescription
              CHINA: AnhuiHighway Rehabilitationand ImprovementProject

1.      Buildinguponthe investments and activities accomplished underthe previous two World
Bankprojects inthe province and inthe context of strengtheningthe current overall framework
for the management and upkeepo f road assets inthe Anhui Province, the project will include the
following components:

ComponentA. Rehabilitationof 890 kmNationaland ProvincialRoads.
[estimated cost US$l93.61 million47.3% o f the total project c o s t - o f which US$97.70 million
will be financed by the Bank Loan]

2.      This component will support the provincial rehabilitationand maintenance program from
2007-2010 under the EFYP. The Bank contribution will help finance eligible investmentsunder
the rehabilitation component ofthe program. The 18 segments to be rehabilitated, for about 890
km, have beenevaluated and found acceptable inthe context ofthe province-wide program o f
rehabilitationo fthe road network.

3.      The interventions include primarily rehabilitation o f damaged road sections and
structures, and resurfacing whole length o f the existing pavements on the road sections. Defects
inthe existing sub-grade would be identifiedand repaired beforeoverlayingthe pavement. The
deteriorated bridgeswill be reinforced or rebuilt. Necessary drainage and protection works will
be provided inorder to minimize premature road deterioration.

4.      Key design features of the 18roads for rehabilitation are as follows:

             Alignment: The 18 roads will be rehabilitatedby following the existingalignments.
             No land acquisition will be requiredunder this component. Some local optimization
             o f the existing longitudinal and horizontal profiles would be undertaken, without the
             need for land acquisition, to improve the driving conditions.

             Pavement: The existing asphalt or cement concrete pavement will be rehabilitated.
             Asphalt concrete (AC) will be generally adopted for the new pavement, except for
             several road segments at mountainous terrain which are overtopped with cement
             concrete pavement.

             Major structures: 18 bridges for a total lengtho f 823 meters will be reconstructed,
             and 170 existing bridgesfor a total lengthof 7,047 meters will be rehabilitatedand
             reinforced.

             Drainage and Slope Protection: Necessary drainage and slope protection works are
             provided inthe designsto avoid premature deterioration o f the roads. Defects inthe
             existing sub-grade are to be repaired before overlaying the pavement.

             Road Safety Facilities: Road safety issues have beenproperly addressed inthe
             designs. A safety-audit exercise, following the MOC-sponsoredprogramo f highway
             safety audit engineering, has been applied to reviewthe safety-related elements in



                                                 35

             the designs. Safety facilities havebeenprovided inthe designto mitigate accident
             risks and enhance the safety of pedestrianand users of non-motorized modes of
             transport.

5.      Onthe road safety issue, inorder to reduce potential accident risks associated with high
traffic speed, the following measures have beenincorporated into the design and the Bill of
Quantities: (a) rubbedplastic rumble strips, bumps or stone-pavedsurface, dependent on the
actual road conditions, will be addedto the branchroads at the approachesto at-grade
intersectionsto force the traffic from the secondaryroads giving way to the traffic on main
roads; (b) transverse rumblepainting or other traffic calming measures, as well as speed limit
signalization, will be addedto alert the traffic to slow down at the areas such as the approaches
to the populated townships, villages and schools, and road stretches with big curve and
longitudinal gradient; (c) longitudinal rumblemedianand side painting should be provided at the
stretches inthe townships and villages, to refrain motorized traffic from invading the opposite
lane and the side lane usedby pedestriansand non-motorizedtraffic; and (d) pedestrianzebra
lines will be provided inthe townships, villages and nearby the school gates. The above
measures, as providedto the rehabilitation roads, are also applied to the improvement roads.

6.      Inaddition, AHAB has agreedto considerthe selectionofone or two Bank-funded roads
to provide pilot urbanized road sections crossing larger townships. This pilot will incorporate
design features often applied to the design of urban roads, suchas underground draining ditches,
pavedpedestriansidewalks, and divisionbetweenmotorized and non-motorized traffic. The
pilot sections would be selected from the roads to be procured in2008 or 2009.

ComponentB. ImprovementKJpgradingof 320km Key Nationaland ProvincialRoads.
[estimated cost US$209.85 million-51.2% of the total project cost - of which US$99.79 million
will be financed by the Bank Loan]

7.      This component consists of improvementhpgrading of sevenkey national andprovincial
roads locatedon the central-eastern and southeasternareas of the Province for atotal length of
about 320 km (Refer to Table A4.1,No.19-25).

8.      Alternative Analysis. The improvement of the roads S322 (Taohuatan-Gaotang) and
S3 11(Chuzhou-Wuyi) include the construction of some sections as to increasethe transport
capacity of the existing corridor or complete missing segments. An in-depthanalysis of the two
roads was conducted. For the road S322, the analysis includedathoroughjustification of
alternative alignments and of the expectedeconomic benefitsof interconnecting the two existing
segments of this road northand south of the Taiping Lake, with an attempt at optimizing the
functionality of the road alignment while reducing overall construction costs. For road S311the
analysis focused on the possibilities of using longer stretches of the existing road (65%), trying
to minimize the amount of new construction.

9.      GeotechnicalInvestigation. The project involves unfavorable geological features, such
as soft ground, expansive soil, weatheredrock slope, karst and coal minecaves. Geological
investigations have beenproperly conducted, and necessary treatment methods have been
provided inthe designs. The bidding document will be preparedbasedon detailed designs. With




                                                  36

more reliable work quantities and cost estimates being available, the work variations are
expectedto be controlled.

10.   Key design features of the seven roads for imurovement/uugrading are as-follows.

            Alignment: The alignment of the existing roads are utilized as muchas possible, in
            order to minimize the resettlement and land acquisition. New alignments are
            provided inthe following cases, suchas by-pass roads outside built-upareas; new
            road stretchto complete the missing segments (S322 Taohuatan-Gantang); new
            alignments to avoid hard topographic conditions.

            Geometricfeatures: Basedon the design speeds, local adjustments of the existing
            longitudinal and horizontal profiles were made to improve the driving conditions.
            Geometric features are improved on the existing high crash locations, which were
            identified through safety-audit exercises.

            Pavement: AC is adoptedinfive of the seven roadsunder this component. Cement
            concrete pavement is adopted for the tunnels andthe two road segments of the G205
            which are located at mountainousterrain.

            Major structures: New constructions consist of two tunnels (1,345 m and 340 m)
            and 67 bridges for atotal length of 3,920 m. And additional 8 existing bridges for a
            total lengthof 990 metersare to be rehabilitated and reinforced.

            Drainage and Slope Protection: Necessarydrainage and slope protection works are
            provided inthe designs to avoid prematuredeterioration of the roads.

            Road Safety Facilities: As inthe case of componentA, road safety issues have been
            addressed inthe designs of the projects under the improvement component.A
            safety-audit exercise, following also the MOC-sponsored program of highway safety
            audit engineering, was appliedto review the safety-relatedelements inthe designs.
            And provisions havebeen incorporated for mitigatingaccidentrisks and enhancing

11.     Under this component, APCD will implement maintenance by contract approaches for at
least two highway sections o f the provincial highway network, with a cumulative number o f 120
kilometers by project's end. The maintenance activities will be limited to routine or periodic
interventions within the existing road pavement width. The final design o f this component will
be supportedby technical assistance, as further described below, that will helpAPCD with
additional knowledge and analytical elements for exploring the alternative maintenance
mechanisms as well as for the preparation and implementation o f the selected contractual
schemes. This component seeks to increase the efficiency of force-account maintenance
practices, which are currently being applied by APCD through the city and county Highway
Bureaus.

12.      Alternatives approaches for contracting maintenance can vary from one based on labor-
intensive activities performed by a micro-enterprise composed o f people living inthe vicinities
o f the road to be maintainedto more encompassing activities-that        can include some periodic
activities that require equipment-performance       by private contractors. These two schemes-or
variations thereof-in    addition can be subject to contractual terms where payments are given on
the basis o f quantities actually carried out, or the basis o f compliance with contractually-
specified performance standards. The definition o fthe final approach will be part o fthe
technical assistancefor APCD maintenance staff (included inthe component on institutional
strengthening)that will provide the knowledge and analytical elements for exploring those
alternative mechanisms as well as for the preparation, implementation, and supervision o f the
preferredcontractual scheme.

13.      This component includes the provisionof improved tools for roadmanagement
(technical, environmental, and economic) and a training program, as follows:

              A study on technological options for the recycling ofpavement materials when a
              pavement needs to be rehabilitated. Inan attempt to reduce the consumption o f
              resources for the rehabilitation o f the network, through this study APCD would like
              to acquire knowledge on practices, approaches and technologies for the utilization o f
              existing materials when road pavementneeds to be rehabilitated. The study would
              be carried out byjoint teams o f international and local consultants, to be selected in
              the early phase o fthe project since AHAB expects the results o fthe study to beused
              as soon as possible for the civil works program under the project.

              The technical assistancefor the pilot on maintenance by contract to provide the
              knowledge and analytical elements for exploring alternative mechanisms for
              contracting o f maintenance activities as well as for the preparation, implementation,
              supervision, and assessment o fthe preferredcontractual scheme under the pilot.

              The preparation of standardized environmental specifications. This study seeks to
              streamline the elaboration o f environmental impact assessments and environmental
              management plans inroad works, for maintenance, rehabilitation, upgrading, or
              construction.

Details of the Sub-Component for the Strengtheningof Road Management Tools at AF'CD

1.      The implementation will draw uponthe recent work undertakenby the Bank" to ensure
that the work adequately balancesthe issues of technology, businessprocessesand staffing
resources.The AHAB agreedto an implementation period of three years, with the goal of having
the PMS with the capability of covering the entire network of national/ provincialroadsinAnhui
fully operational by December2009.

2.      The work will have three distinctphases that would runinparallel:

        (a)    PhaseI:Business ProcessAnalysis. An analysiswas done during appraisalofthe
               business operations of the AHAB to confirm the role of the PMS inthe agency,
               how it will be institutionalized and managed, and how the outputs will be usedin
               the business. AHAB is coordinatingwith APCD andthe prefecturalhighway
               administration bureaus to establishan institutionalized multi-level working group
               that will be directly involved inroad management improvement. 34 engineers or
               technicians from the 17 regional AHABs (2 persons from each region) will
               participate inthis assignment as regional level users of the CPMS, about 5 people
               from AHAB (2 from RoadMaintenanceDivision, 2 from Budgeting and Project
               Planning Division, and 1 or 2 from AHAB Director office) will be directly
               involved as provinciallevel users and investment decision makers, and 1 or 2 staff
               from the Planning Division of APCD will use the application to verify and audit
               annual pavement rehabilitation programsand investments. Also, adequate
               resourceswill be allocated for data collection, as indicated below.

               Continuous attention needs to be paidto this topic, to ensure that the PMS has the
               correct institutional and logistical support to be of value. This will be an important
               part ofthejoint annual reviews of CPMS during implementation.

        (b)    Phase11: Implementationof CPMS Software. The AHAB will procure the new
               CPMS software which will be installed by the provider (RIOH). Training and
               technical support will be includedinthe system procurement. The technical
               support would include assistance to HABto modify the pavement deterioration
               models, unit costs information, economic parameters and customization of
               reporting functions required by AHAB.

               CPMS implementation will be gradual, dependingon progress inproper data
               collection. This will start with two regional highway networks (Chuzhou and
               Wuhu regions, with approximately 1100km) in 2007, and five regional highway
               networks (Hefei, Ma'anshan, Anqing, Huangshan, Suzhou, with approximately
               4200 km) in2008. Application o f the system to manage the whole national and
               provincial highway network inAnhui is then scheduledfor end December2009.

         (c)   Phase 111: Sustainable Data Collection Services. The AHAB plans to contract
               the Anhui Highway EngineeringTesting and Inspection Center to collect road
               condition data periodically to meet the requirement o fthe new CPMS. The Bank's
               new generic terms o f reference for data collection services will beusedto develop
               the specification for data collection services. This will ensure that the data
               collection i s done in a sustainable manner, focusing on key data collected at an
               appropriate frequency and level o f detail. A key aspect to the work will be proper
               calibration and validation o f equipment.

               AHAB is fully committedto provide the necessary resources for data collection. It
               i s expected that these resources will grow gradually to attain an expected level of
               about .Y5,000,000 (approximately US$640,000) annually for fiscal year 2009 and
               later when the system is fully operational.

              CHINA: Anhui Highway Rehabilitationand Improvement Project

1.      The overall development and implementation o fthe laws, policies and regulations related
to transport inthe Anhui Province rests withinthe APCD. APCD i s responsible directly or by
providing financial support and technical guidance for the construction o f highway infrastructure
(as well as waterway infrastructure). To undertakethese responsibilities, APCD has about 53
high-level managerial and technical staff, dividedineight operational divisions, depending from
one General Director, three Deputy Directors, and one Chief Engineer, located at its headquarters
inHefei. Attachment 1includes a schematic representation ofthe organization structure of
APCD.

2.      The APCD is directly responsible for investments on Anhui's national and provincial
highways (with a current lengtho f about 11,250 km). Inaddition, APCD, through the cities and
counties inthe province, i s responsible for supporting the development o f the county and
township roads. APCD conforms to the general sector policies and technical guidelines issues
by the MOC. This division o f responsibilities for investments translates into a similar division o f
responsibilities for the administration and maintenance o f the road network inAnhui. The
administration and maintenance o f the network takes place at three levels: (a) APCD's AHAB;
(b) the eleven traffic bureaus o fthe citiedprefectures; and (c) local-level highway unitsofthe
county highway bureaus. AHAB provides resource transfers and technical guidance on the
maintenance of county and township roads. The development and maintenance o f village roads
i s managed by the communication departments at the municipal and county level and operated
locally.

3.      The AHAB is the department responsible for highway construction andthe management
and maintenance o fthe national and provincial road network. It includes 143 staff at its core
units. UnderAHAB there are another 13,470 staffresponsible for the maintenance and
rehabilitation o f the provincial and national roads, including 1,562 staff inadministrative and
managerial positions and 11,908 maintenance employees. Inaddition, there are several other
deconcentrated units-such as the Anhui Highway Technical School or the Anhui Huan'an
Highway Construction and Development Center-that          specialized intechnical and strategic
research.

OrganizationalArrangements and Responsibilitiesfor ProjectImplementation

4.      The overall responsibility for project execution and coordination will rest with the
APCD. The APCD will ultimately be responsible for ensuring compliance with the provisions of
the legal agreements. The APCD will retainthe current World Bank PEO to coordinate project
implementation, process and authorize disbursements,manage procurement, monitor
implementationprogress, collect data for the results indicators, and make arrangements for Bank
supervision missions. The PEO will act as the main counterpart contact with the Bank team.

5.      The APCD has assigned a high-levelprofessional to headthe PEO. The PEO is headed
by a Director and three Deputy Directors, with about 30 staff spread over 6 subdivisions,
including those incharge o f monitoring compliance with safeguards policies (land acquisition
and resettlement, and environmental protection), and for the control of technical and engineering


                                                  45

quality. The PEO was created inMarch 1997for the purpose of implementing the first World
Bank-financed highway project inAnhui and continued as a unit for the implementation of the
SecondAnhui Highway Project. Basedon the proven value-added, quality control, and overall
monitoring and reporting, shown during the previous two World Bank-financedoperations, the
PEO will remain inplace over the course of the implementation of the new proposedproject.
Readjustmentsto the skills mix of the PEO staff will be carried out gradually given the different
focus of the proposednew project on provincial and national roads rather than on expressways-
the main investment componentsunderthe First and SecondAnhui Highway Projects-and the
emphasis on the strengtheningof road management capacities at APCD (and AHAB, in
particular).

6.      While APCD, through the PEO, will remain responsiblefor overall project management
and coordination, the AHAB, through its PCMO, will be incharge of the implementation of the
rehabilitation and improvement componentsofthe project as well as of the contracting of the
related supervision activities. Experiencedpersonnelwho have beeninvolved inthe
procurement of the First and SecondAnhui Highway Projects will be assignedthe responsibility
of overall supervision and guidance for the procurement activities of the proposedproject,
supporting the PCMO incarrying out the procurement activities, andthe daily overall
management of the execution ofthe works under the first two components ofthe project. The
PCMO will also have the professional assistance by procurement agents inperforming its
procurement functions.

7.      The maintenancepilot andtechnical assistance components ofthe project will be directly
underthe responsibility of the APCD, through the PEO, and with the technical inputsfrom, and
coordination with, the AHAB, as relevant. Lastly, the APCD, through the PEO, will also be
responsiblefor the implementation of the training program, ensuring the participation of key
APCD professionalsfrom across the Province.

8.      Given that the 25 project roadsare scattered in 12 citiedprefectures of Anhui province,16
for a more efficient project implementation, the AHAB will use its deconcentratedunitsat the 12
local city/prefecture highway administration bureauswhere the rehabilitation and improvement
works will take place. Sub-PCMOs will then be set up ineach affected city/prefecture for the
management and supervision of the project civil works (both rehabilitation and improvement).
The local highway administrationbureauswill assignexperiencedstaffto the Sub-PCMOs.
With the technical guidance and financing support by AHAB, these Sub-PCMOs will act as local
implementing agencies. The APCD (through AHAB) will monitor their activities to ensure
compliance with World Bank fiduciary and safeguardsrequirementsandthose included inthe
legal agreements, as pertinent. The specific duties of each sub-PCMO will depend on the
characteristicsof the road sectionwithin their jurisdiction and, where needed, they will have the
support of the relevant specialists. They will report directly to AHAB andthe central PEO. A
project management manual has beenprepared(by May 31,2007), clarifying the responsibilities
and reporting requirementsamongthe PEO, PCMO and Sub-PCMOs inrespect of the
procurementactivities. The chart below summarizesthe organizational arrangements for project
implementation.



16There are 17 cities (and prefectures)in Anhui Province.

              Annex 7: FinancialManagementand DisbursementArrangements
              CHINA: Anhui Highway Rehabilitationand ImprovementProject

Introduction

1.      An assessmentofthe adequacy ofthe project financial management system ofthe Anhui
Road Rehabilitation and Improvement Project was conducted. The assessment, based on
guidelines issued by the Financial Management Sector Board on November 3,2005, concluded
that the project meets minimumBank financial management requirements,as stipulated in
BP/OP 10.02. The project will maintain financial management arrangements that are acceptable
to the Bank and that, as part o f the overall arrangements that the borrower has inplace for
implementingthe operation, provide reasonable assurancethat the proceeds ofthe loan are used
for the purposes for which the loan was granted. Financial management risk i s the risk that
World Bank loan will not be usedfor the purposes intended and i s a combination o f country,
sector and project specific risk factors. The FMrisk rating proposed for this project duringthe
appraisal stage i s modest.

2,      Fundingsources for the project include Bank loan and counterpart funds. The Bank loan
proceeds will flow from the Bank into project designated account (DA) to be set up at and
managed by APFB. The Bank loan will flow from the DA to Anhui Provincial Communications
Department World Bank PEO, to AHAB, to the Sub-PCMOs inthe 12 project prefectures, then
finally to the contractors. The Bank loan will be signed between the Bank and the People's
Republic o f China through its Ministryo f Finance (MOF), and the subsidiary loan agreements
will be signedbetween MOF and the provincial government o f Anhui through APFB, and then
APFB will further on lendto APCD, who will be responsible for the final repayment.
Counterpart funds consist o f government appropriation and commercial debt.

3.      No outstanding audits or audit issues exist with any o fthe above implementing agencies
involved inthe project. However, the task team will continue to be attentive to financial
management matters duringproject supervisions.

Audit Arrangements

4.      The Bank requires that project financial statements be audited inaccordance with
standards acceptable to the Bank. Inline with other Bank financed projects in China, the project
will be audited inaccordance with InternationalAuditing Standards andthe Government
Auditing Standards ofthe People's Republic of China. The Anhui Provincial Audit Office
(APAO) has beenidentifiedas the auditor for this project. Annual audit report will be issuedby
APAO.

5.      The annual audit report ofproject financial statements will be due to the Bank within 6
months after the end o f each calendar year. This requirement is stipulated inthe loan
agreements. The responsible agency and timing are summarized as follows:

            Audit Report                   Submitted by                  Due date

                         Project Financial Management(PFM) systems are
                         functioningreasonably well. See the following mitigating
                         measures utilizedin the project.
   Entity Level  Low     Both APCD and AHAB have extensive experience in World

14.     Therefore, the overall FMrisk-rating of this project at the appraisal stage i s modest. The
FMS will monitor the project FMrisk duringproject implementation.

15.     Strengths. APCD and AHAB have been incharge of, or involved with, the
implementation o f the Anhui Highway Project Iand 11. The successful implementationo fthese
projects has demonstrated their ability to manage World Bank financed projects. Their overall
management and supervisionon this new project will ensure the proper usage o f project funds.
Additionally, the local highway administration bureaus inthe six of the 12 project
citiedprefectures also participatedinthe First and Second Anhui Highway Projects, so they
should be able to implement this project without much difficulty.

16.      WeaknessesandAction Plan, Besides the FMrisks identified inpara. 13 above, no
other significant weakness are identified.

ImplementingAgencies

17.     Similar to previous Bank financed highway projects, APCD PEO will be responsible for
overall project management and coordination and specifically for the implementation o f the
institutional strengthening component. AHAB will implementthe road rehabilitation and
improvement components. As the 25 project roads are scattered in 12 prefectures of Anhui
province, for better project implementation and improving local government's accountability,
each o f the 12 local prefecture highway administration bureaus (deconcentrated units o f the
AHAB) will assign experienced staffto form the Sub-PCMOs. With the technical guidance and
financing support by AHAB, these Sub-PCMOs will act as local implementingagency for this
project.

Budgeting

18.     Inaccordance with project implementation planand construction progress, the PEO and
AHAB will prepare annual budgets. This budget will be reviewed and approved by APFB and
Provincial Development Reform Commission. Based on the approved budget, APCD will
provide annual government appropriations and AHAB and local highway administration bureaus
will arrange domestic loans. For budgetvariances arising duringexecution, necessary
authorization and closely monitoring will be done. Timely and accurate information on
variances will be used as the basis for mid-termadjustments.

Accounting

19.     The administration, accounting and reporting ofthe project will be set up inaccordance
with the Circular #13: "Accounting Regulations for World Bank Financed Projects" issued in
January 2000 by MOF. The circular provides in-depth instructions o f accountingtreatment o f
project activities and covers the following:

             Chart o f account;

             Detailed accounting instructions for each project account;

             Standard set o f project financial statements; and


                                                  53

       (d) Instructionson the preparation ofproject financial statements.

20.    The project financial reporting package, including detail format and content o fproject
financial statements was agreed to between the Bank and MOF. This set of project financial
reporting package includes the following:

       (a)   Balance Sheet;

       (b) Summary of Sources and Uses of Fundsby Project Component;

       (c)   Uses o f Loans by Project Category;

       (d) DA Activity Statement; and

       (e)   Notes to Financial Statements.

21,    The PEO, AHAB and Sub-PCMOs will be managing, monitoring and maintaining
respective project accounting records. The PEO will also prepare a consolidated project
financial reporting package for the whole project and submit it to the Bank for reviewand
comments on a biannual basis. Original supporting documents for project activities will be
retained by respective implementingagencies.

22.    Adequate project accounting staff with educational background and work experience
commensurate with the work they are expected to perform i s one o f the factors critical to the
successful implementation o fproject financial management. Based on discussions, observation
and review o f educational background and work experience o f the staff identifiedfor financial
and accounting positions inthe implementing agencies, the task team noted that they are
qualified and appropriate for the work they are expected to assume. For those unidentified
project financial staff, the required qualifications, including but not limited to educational
background, relevant work experience, and accounting qualifications, have been assessed as
acceptable to the Bank and stipulated inthe project financial management manual. During
project implementation, the Bank will review their capacity through discussions and review and
necessary training will also be provided to strengthentheir capacity.

23.    To strengthen financial management capacity and achieve consistent quality o f
accounting work, a project financial management manual (the Manual) has beenprepared. In
addition to the aforementioned required qualification o f project financial staff, the Manual will
provide detailed guidelines on financial management, internal controls, accounting procedures,
fund and asset management and withdrawal applicationprocedures, etc. The first draft o fthe
Manual has been prepared and submittedto the Bank for review. The FMS has provided
feedback and the Manual has beenfinalized and distributed to all the relevant financial staff.

24.    This project will use the computerized financial management system, RuanZhi Xin, a
well-established China accounting software package approved by MOF and which beenwidely
used withintransportation sector inAnhui. The task team will monitor the processing of
accounting work closely, especially inthe initial stages to ensure complete and accurate financial
information will be provided in a timely manner.

Internal Control and InternalAuditing

25,     The project has established internal control procedures and policies, including approval
and authorization controls, segregation o f duties, clear staff functions, and safeguarding assets.
The funds flow will be arranged and monitoredthrough the finance bureau channels and will
include their substantive review.

26.     BothAPCD and AHAB have their own internal inspection divisions, who will function
as the internal audit for this project, by conducting compliance and transaction oriented
examinations on regular basis. Duringproject implementation, the Bank will review their
project examination reports and determine whether the Bank can rely on their work.

Financial Reporting

27.     The format and content o fthe project financial statements represents the standard project
financial reportingpackage agreed to betweenthe Bank and MOF, and have beendiscussed and
agreed to with all parties concerned.

28.     Each implementing agency will preparefinancial statements on its implemented
components, which will then be usedby the PEO for preparing consolidated project financial
statements and submittedto the Bank for review and comment on a regular basis. Inline with
the updated World Bank's Operation Manual, the interimun-audited project financial statements
should be submitted as part o f progress report to the Bank on a semi-annual basis (prior to
August 15 and February 15 o f the following year).

RetroactiveFinancing

29.     Retroactive financing will be available for this project inthe amount o f US$20million
for payments made under any o f the components prior to the signingo f the loan agreement and
after July 1,2007.

Financial Covenants

30.     No additional financial covenants are proposed other than the standard financial
covenants, (e.g. maintaining project accounts inaccordance with sound accounting practices,
audit requirement and SOE), as described inthe legal agreements.

Supervision Plan

3 1.    The supervision strategy for this project i s based on its FMrisk rating, which will be
evaluated on regular basis by the Task Team (withthe support o fthe team's FMS).

                Annex 8: Public Financingand FiscalCapacity of Anhui Province
               CHINA: Anhui HighwayRehabilitationand ImprovementProject

Introduction

1.       The challenge facing many provinces inChina inthe highway sector is how to maintain
and expand road assets to support the desiredeconomic growth withintheir fiscal envelopes.
This Annex summarizes the public finance framework for the highway sector inthe Anhui
Province. The purpose o f this analysis was to ascertain whether inAnhui Province: (a) there i s a
healthy fiscal situation; (b) the appropriate linkage i s made between macroeconomic and revenue
projections and public expenditure proposals; (c) the policy and planning process i s tightly
linked to the annual budget; and (d) the highway sector policy and planning provides a realistic
resource framework to cover the expected development and preservation o f assets.

2.       The fiscal system inChina is characterized by the sharingoftax revenues between the
central government and sub-national (Le. provincial, prefecture, county, and township)
governments. According to their respective responsibilities, the central government is
responsible mainly for expenditures for national defense, foreign affairs, and the operation o f
central government agencies, as well as expendituresfor economic restructuring, development
coordination among regions and macroeconomic adjustment. The provinciaMoca1governments
are mainly responsible for expenses on the operation o f government agencies under their
respective jurisdictions, as well as expenditure for economic and social development intheir
regions. As a result, nearly 70 percent o f total public expenditure inChina takes place at the sub-
national level, of which more than 55 percent takes place at sub-provincial levels.

3.       Inthis context, the public budgetis definedand executed inahighlydecentralized
manner amongthe 31provincial-, 331prefecture-, 2,109 county-, and44,74 1township-level
units.The national budgetis composed ofthe centralgovernment budgetand sub-national
government budgets.As stipulated by the Budget Law o f the People's Republic o f China, the
budget draft and budget implementation o f the central and local governments must be reviewed
and approved by the National People's Congress and Provincial People's Congresses,
respectively. The central and local budget adjustment plans and final accounts must be reviewed
and approved by the Standing Committee o f the National People's Congress and local
congresses.

4.      As mentionedabove, sub-national governments inChina are responsible for financing,
infrastructure investmentsthat support the supply o f services and are critical for promoting
economic growth and development. This i s inline with efficiency considerations -the level o f
government responsible for providing the services should make decisions regarding investments
necessary for them. The sub-national governments inChina are only permitted to borrow through
on-lendingo f external loans contracted by the Central Government or from the state
development banks". The Budget Law (1994) clearly prohibits sub-national governments to
carry any deficit or debts intheir annual budgeting process.

OverallFiscalStatus in AnhuiProvince

5.         Following the policies set out by the tax reform o f 1994,Anhui province shares the
revenues from value-added tax and enterprise income tax with the central government. This
policy increases the central government's share o f revenues; however, a large portion o f the
central revenuesare designated as tax rebates (value-added tax rebate and consumption tax
rebate) and transfer payments, which are reallocated to the provinces.

6.         InAnhui province, local budgetary revenue is usedinterchangeably with fiscal revenue.
The total budgetary revenue includes local budgetaryrevenue andtotal tax rebates; the total
disposable revenue comprises local budgetary revenue as well as transfer payment and tax
rebates from the central government; the total revenue i s total budgetary revenue plus off-
budgetaryrevenue and local matching funds.

7.         China's Budget Law-enacted in 1995 and currently under revision-explicitly defines
and regulates the following public finance practices: fiscal administration, disciplines, budgeting,
review and approval process, execution, adjustment, and auditing. Inaccordance with the
Budget Law, each sector inAnhui Province formulates its own budgetproposal consistent with
the pertinentsectoral development plan and submitsit to the Provincial Finance Bureau. The
Provincial Finance Bureau consolidates all the budgetproposals and formulates an overall
provincial budget based on budget constraints and strategic priorities (taking socio-economic
development master planinto consideration). Subsequently, the overall provincial budget i s
presented to the Provincial People's Congress for review and approval. Once the budget i s
approved by the Provincial People's Congress, the Provincial Finance Department allocates the
funds to various provincial sectoral units/departments.

8.        The review o fthe current practices o fpublic finance management inAnhui Province
shows that the public expenditure proposals are generally consistent with the macroeconomic
and revenue projections inthe Province. Moreover, the policy andplanningprocess is
acceptably linkedto the annual budget.However, as inother provinces in China, the off-budget
revenueand contingent liability management remainareas to be improved inAnhui province.
The current practice o fthe off-budget revenue and contingent liability management hindersthe
APFB from monitoring the overall effectiveness o fpublic spending and optimizing investment
among sectors, given budget constraints. The APFB i s inthe process o f correcting these
weaknesses for strengthening the current public finance management approach at the same time
as the ongoing reform agenda proceeds at the central level.




Control of the SecuritiesMarket and other relevant regulations." Article 3: "Sub-national governmentsare prohibitedfrom, either
directly or indirectly, issuing bonds."
Budget Law (January 1995): "All levels of local governments shall prepare their budgets on the basis of spending within their
means and to achieve balanced budgets, and not to incur deficits; apart from changes conferred by law and the State Council,
local governments are prohibitedfrom issuing any type of local governmentbonds." (Article 28) (Issued by NPC).
GuaranteeLaw (July 1995): "All government organs are not allowed to provideguaranteesfor any institutions, unless
otherwise approved by the State Council, for utilization of bilateral loans and loans from international monetary institutions."

OverallEconomic SituationinAnhuiProvince

9.       Anhui has beenenjoying rapid growth both interms of GDP per capita and fiscal revenue
for the past several years. The average growth rate of nominal GDP per capita between2003 and
2005 has beena remarkable 17 percent (21% in2004 and 12% in2005); while the real average
growth rate was approximately 11.5 percent (14% in2004 and 9% in2005) by applying national
average GDP deflators. The average fiscal revenue increase during that period has been at
around 24 percent (26.2% in2004 and 26.1% in2005). Table A8.1 and Figure A8.1 show the
GPD growth rates from 2003 until2005 and the expenditures on selected sectors for the 2000 to
2004 period, respectively.

 11.     The fiscal space for infrastructure development remains at a steady level, roughly 10
percent o f the total budgetary revenueo f each year from year 2000 to 2004. O f all the sectors,
the education sector represents the largest share o f the expenditures, accounting for more than 16
percent o f the annual total budgetary revenueon average. The prioritization o f investments i s
based on the socio-economic master plan o f the province, minimumexpenditure growth set for
inthe respective sectoral laws'' and sectoral public expenditure proposals.

Highway Sector PublicExpenditure Management

12.      As highway construction accounts for more than 90 percent o fthe transport construction
inAnhui Province, the analysis focuses onthe highway sector.

13.      The revenue and expenditure related to the highway sector inAnhui Province are
currently under the responsibilitieso f the APCD,incompliance with the planning/resources
allocation process at the provincial level as mentioned inthe previous section. The
planningh-esources allocationprocess i s subject to thejoint reviews o f Anhui Development and
Reform Commission (ADRC) and APFB before the effective use o f the resources can start. As it
i s generally the case, the revenues raised at the provincial level are not sufficient to meet the
demands for infrastructuredevelopment. Therefore, subsidiesfrom the central government, as
well as loans from domestic banks play an important role inbridgingthe gap. Major revenue
resources for the highway sector encompass: (a) road maintenance fees; (b) tolls; (c) surcharges
on passenger tickets; (d) MOC subsidies; and (e) funds raised by enterprises.

14.     The APCD prioritizes planningand allocates resources inthe following order: (a) wages
for highway sector employees; (b) safety management o f roads to ensure fair service levels o f the
road network; (c) routine maintenance, medium and large repairs; and (d) new construction or
improvement o f highways (including rehabilitation works) based on the remaining estimated
disposable revenue. Table A8.3 presents the Anhui highway sector revenue and expenditure
from 2003 to 2005. The highway sector expenditure inAnhui Province has beenat a steady and
moderate level o f 4 percent o f its GDP from 2003 to 2005.

15.    As shown inFigureA8.2, the overall Anhui transport sector revenuehas been strongly
increasing (56 percent from 2003 to 2006) and i s expected to continue increasing. Revenuesare
collected from a variety o f sources, and the relative contribution from these sources i s expected
to change over time. Key trends are the following:

              Revenues from road maintenance fees and tolls have increased significantly
              (especially tolls from 2004 to 2005), andthe trend i s expected to continue,
              representing more than 50 percent o f the total revenuefrom 2009 onwards. (This
              trendmay vary inlight o f discussions about the implementation o f a fuel charge
              policy that may imply changes to the structure and level o f the road maintenance
              fee).

              Revenues from surcharges on passengertickets and MOC subsidies are also
              expected to increase steadily, but less drastically and from a lower base.

              Bank loans peaked at 6,155 millionRMB in2005 andare expected to decrease and
              stabilize at 5,000 million RMB and 4,000 million RMB respectively for the Eleventh
              and Twelfth FYP. Bank loans account for 37 percent o f total revenueinAnhui
              highway sector inthe year 2003 and are expected to steadily decrease to 12 percent
              o f total revenue by the year 2015.

         (d) The indebtedness as measured by debt over disposable revenue is at a healthy level
               and on a downward trend.

16.      Insum, the Anhui highway sector revenuesappear on a satisfactorily sustainable path in
the mediumterm, owing inparticular to the availability of increasing toll revenues which are
recycled inthe sector.

17.      On the expenditure side, the overall Anhui transport sector expenditures have been
strongly increasing (56% increase from 2003-2006) and are expected to continue increasing.
Most o f the expenditures are for new constructionand improvements: on average 76% o f actual
and expected expenditures for 2003-2015 (without including rehabilitation, activity which often
i s included as part o f the budget line for improvement). These expenditures are expected to
increase steadily. Expenditures on repair and maintenance (including large and mediumrepair
and routine maintenance) represent on average 9% o f the actual and expected expenditures for
2003-2015.       Other expenses include taxes, traffic safety supervision, management and study,
and repayment o f interest and principle. These expenses represent on average 7% o f actual and
expected expendituresfor 2003-2015 and are also expected to increase steadily.

18.      Focusingon the AHAB-unit responsible for the upgrade, rehabilitationand
maintenance of the national and provincial road network-Table                      A8.4 presents the resources
allocated to various activities over the last three years. (The differences with the values in Table
A8.3 are due to the investments undertaken by APCD on expressways, inland waterways, and
rural roads.) The picture shows a decreasing trend for construction and an increasing relevance
of rehabilitation and maintenance activities. The shift has been more pronouncedin2006, when


                                                                 61

the increaseson periodic androutine maintenance activities continuedincreasing while those for
construction decreased markedly. The expenditures allocated to rehabilitation and maintenance
are expected to increase slightly higher as the APCD-and      its AHAB unit-translates   its
commitment to the preservation o f road assets, and the more so once the new CPMS provides
reliable information on, and confirms the need for, appropriate sustained allocation o f budgetary
resources to maintenance. The percentage o f resources allocated to rehabilitation and

Conclusion

19.     This analysis shows that Anhui highway sector is strong inrevenue generation and will
continue to be strong though more forceful emphasis should be placedto the upkeep o f an
increasing number o f road assets. The indebtedness i s o f a manageable level. Debt service does
not create any significant fiscal burdento Anhui province as it only accounted for 0.56% o f the
total revenue in Year 2003, although it may increase to single digit numbers by the end of the
12thFYP. This favorable context will allow APCD and AHAB to face the increased
requirementsfor roadmaintenance and rehabilitation, and better manage the transition towards a
sustainable and more balanced allocation o f resources betweenroad network development and
preservation.

                              Annex 9: ProcurementArrangements
              CHINA: Anhui HighwayRehabilitationand ImprovementProject

A.      General

 1.     Procurement for the project will be carried out inaccordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRDLoans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004 (Revised
October 2006), and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers" dated May 2004 (RevisedOctober 2006), and the provisions stipulated inthe Legal
Agreement. The general description ofvarious items under different expenditurecategories is
included below.

2.      For each contract to be financed by the loan, the different procurement methods,
consultant selection methods, the need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior review
requirements,andtime frame are agreed to inthe Procurement Plan. The Procurement Planwill
be updated at least annually or as requiredto reflect the actual project implementation needs and
improvements in institutional capacity.

3.      Procurement of Works. Bank funds underthe project will be used to mainly finance the
construction works under the three components o f the project, i.e. Component A Road-
Rehabilitation, Component B - Road Improvement, and Component C - RoadMaintenance.
Several considerations have beentaken into account inplanning the procurement packaging,
mainly among them: (a) the physical and location characteristics o f the works; (b) specific
engineering requirements (e.g., tunnels, bridges, pavement); (c) limits o f administrative
jurisdictions (cities) that would provide the technical staffing for construction supervision and
management; (d) phasing o f civil works activities to avoid major affection to traffic on the road
corridors; and (e) for the rehabilitation component, balance o f contract sizes to encourage local
companies to participate as larger companies would not likely be interested (or, if they are,
would likely attempt to sub-contract most o f the works to those local companies). Component A
(rehabilitation works) has 41 contracts for widening and consolidating bridges, pavement works
and grade intersectionworks with a total amount o f US$ 190.71million and an average value o f
US$4.65 millionper contract; Component B (improvement works) has 16 contracts for sub-
grade, bridge, culvert, tunnel and pavement works with a total amount of US$204.69 million and
an average value o f US$12.79 million per contract. A number o f contracts under Component B
for an amount o f about US$87.95 million will be procured following International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) procedures with biddersto be prequalified. Other contracts under Components A
and B will be procured on National Competitive Bidding (NCB) basis with postqualification
process. Under Component C-Road Maintenance, at least two roads will be selected from the
existing highways to pilot new mechanism o f road maintenance with a total amount o f US$1.60
million.

4.      Works estimated to cost at or more than US$15 million equivalent per contract will be
procuredthrough ICB procedures, estimated to cost less thanUS$15 million equivalent per
contract through N C B procedures, and estimated to cost less thanUS$200,000 equivalent per
contract through Shoppingprocedures. NCB procurement o f works will be advertised inat least
one newspaper of national circulation, except those contracts costing less than US$2 million each



                                                 63

which may be advertised inat least one newspaper o f provincial level. The procurement will be
done usingthe Bank's current Standard BiddingDocuments (SBDs) for all ICB contracts and the
Bank-approvedChinese Model Bidding Documents (MBDs) (dated May 1997 and issued by
MOF) for all NCB contracts. Whenthe MBDsare adopted, all new revisions made to the Bank's
SBDs since 1997 will be incorporated.

5.      Procurement of Goods. N o procurement o f Goods has beenplannedunder this project.

6.      Procurement of ConsultingServicesand Training. Services andtraining required for
the project include: (a) a study on technological issues o f pavement change and recycling with a
cost estimate o f US$O.15 million; (b) technical assistance for the pilot on road maintenance with
a cost estimate o f US$0.09 million; (c) training and study tour with a cost estimate of US$0.75
million; and (d) preparation for environmental standard with a cost estimate o f US$0.06 million.
Services by firms estimated to cost at or more than US$0.2 million will be procured through
Quality- and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS); services meetingthe requirements o f paragraph 3.2
o f the Consultant Guidelines will be procuredthrough the procedures o f Quality-Based Selection
(QBS); those services estimated to cost less than US$0.2 million equivalent per contract may be
procuredthrough procedures of Selection Based on the Consultants' Qualifications (CQS) in
accordance with the provisions o f paragraphs 3.7 through 3.8 o f the Consultant Guidelines.
Services by individuals will be procured inaccordance with the provisions o f paragraphs 5.1
through 5.4 o f the Consultant Guidelines.Expendituresfor training workshops and study tours
will be disbursedagainst reasonable actual costs.

7.      The Standard Request for Proposals (May 2004) shall be used for recruitment o f
consultants. Short lists of consultants for a service estimated to cost less than US$0.3 million
equivalent may be composed entirely o f national consultants inaccordance with the provisions
of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines.

B.      Assessment of the Agency's Capacity to ImplementProcurement

9.      Procurement activities under this project will be carried out by PEO o f APCD and PCMO
o f AHAB.

10.     PEO o f APCD i s a project management unit experienced inhandlingBank-financed
procurement by implementing the previous Bank-financed Anhui Highway Iand I1projects. For
the proposed project, PEO will continue to provide the overall supervisionand guidance on
procurement to the implementing unit, PCMO o f AHAB.

11.     This is the first time for PCMO o f AHAB to implement a Bank-financed project. PCMO
will carry out the procurement activities and the daily overall management o fthe project
implementation with support o f Sub-PCMOs, which will be established inmunicipalities for site
construction management and supervision. PCMO procurement staff has highway engineering
background and experience inhandlingdomestic-funded procurement of works. PCMO has
hiredCMC International TenderingCompany (ITC) as procurement agent to assist incarrying
out ICB andN C B procurement. CMC ITC has handled several Bank-financed highway projects
inChinaand is quiteexperienced inBank-financedprocurement. To familiarize staffofboth
PCMO and Sub-PCMOs with Bank's procurement policies and procedures, procurement staff o f
the Bank Office inBeijingprovided one training workshop inearly March2007. PCMO and
Sub-PCMOs will also send their staff to other training courses on Bank-financed procurement
available in five Chinese Universities duringthe project implementation.

12.    Inview ofthe above arrangements and commitments, the overall project risk for
procurement i s assessed as: AVERAGE.

C.     ProcurementPlan

13.    The Borrower, at pre-appraisal, developed a Procurement Plan for project implementation
which provides the basis for the procurement methods. This planwas agreed between the
Borrower and the Project Team on April 25,2007 and i s available at the APCD's office inHefei
(Attachment 1). It will also be available inthe Project files and postedinthe Bank's external
website after Loan approval. The Procurement Planwill be updated inagreement with the
Project Team annually or as requiredto reflect the actual project implementation needs and
improvements ininstitutional capacity.

14.    Table A9.2 shows the project costs by procurement arrangement as embodied inthe
procurement plan.

D.      Frequencyof ProcurementSupervision

15.     Inaddition to the prior reviewsupervision to be carried out by the Bank's supervision
team, the capacity assessment o f the ImplementingAgency has recommended a supervision
mission every six months to carry out post review o f procurement actions upon completion of a
sufficient number of procurement activities, or when post review contracts are signed and
implemented duringthe review period.

E.      RetroactiveFinancing

Advance contracting may be applied for some contracts under components for rod rehabilitation
and improvement. Their expenditures incurred after July 1,2007 and within one year before the
signing date o fthe Loan Agreement would be retroactively financed by the Loan. The estimated
amount for retroactive financing under this project would be about US$20 million intotal.
Procurement o f those contracts subject to retroactive financing will be carried out inaccordance
with the Bank's Guidelines,and the related Bank conditions on land resettlement mustbe
satisfied first.

               CHINA: Anhui HighwayRehabilitationand ImprovementProject

ECONOMIC EVALUATION

Preface

1.      The economic evaluation o fthe project covers all the project roads, totaling 1,203.7 kmand
can be further dividedinto 2 categories:

        (a)    rehabilitation o f 13 roads (18 segments, 885.6 km); and

        (b) improvement of4 roads (7 segments, 318.1km).

2.      The analysis is basedonthe actual and forecast data ontraffic volume, vehicle operating
cost, user's time cost savings, reduction inaccident cost and economic project cost. The main
inputsfor the evaluation are:

        (a)    capital investmentand maintenance costs, reflecting April 2007 prices;

        (b) the benefit stream, also reflecting April 2007 prices, that comprises of savings in
               vehicle operating cost (VOC), travel time savings, and reductioninaccident costs;

        (c)    a capital investmentperiod fiom 2007-2011 and anevaluation o fbenefits periodo f 20
               years; and

        (d) a full benefits starting 2008- 2012, dependingonthe roads.

HighwayDevelopmentPlan

3.      Anhuiis a land-lockedprovince (about 140,000 km2)located inthe centralregionofChina.
The province is animportant inlandtransport hubo f China serving the north- south boundtransport
(as a landbridge betweenthe Yellow River tributary and the Yangtze River tributary) as well as
links the western inlandprovinces to the easterncoastal provinces. The western and southern part
of the province is mountainous terrain. The Yangtze Riverruns across fiom the south- western o f
the province to the east passing Jiangsu province, Shanghai and flows to the easternChina sea. The
provincial capital city o f Hefei is locatedat the center o fthe province. All the major long distance
transport modes (railways, highways and air transport) converge at the city.

4.      Anhui is apoor provinceinChina. Basedonthe latest available data, in2005, the annual
GDP per capita ofAnhui (RMB 8,597) constitutes only about 61-2%ofthe national's average
(RMB 14,040) or 35.1%, 31.3% and 16.7%% ofthe easterncoastalprovinces ofJiangsu (RMB
24312), Zhejiang(RMB 27,458) and Shanghai (RMB 51,489, respectively. To reduce the
income and the economic disparities, Anhui province is undertaking a highway development plan
as a part o f the overall efforts to narrowthe differences between the inlandprovinces withthe
coastal provinces. The objectives o fthe plan are: (a) to improvethe quality of the road services
(about two thirds o fthe provincial road network is the low class roads-Class IV and under, and



                                                    72

about 50% o fthe roads are unpaved); (b) to enhance the road connections with the coastal regions;
and (c) to improve the localroadnetworks particularly for the remote mountainous areas.

5.         After completion o fthe project, the east- west bond traffic will be able to cross the
province within 3 hours, and, 6 hours for the north- south boundtraffic. Inaddition, all the main
local cities would have an expressway that links to Hefei. Supported by a better paved local road
networks, every prefecture would be able to access the expressway within one hour traveling
time. Furthermore, by the end of 2010, every village inAnhui will have at least one pavedroad
available to the local residents. The project will greatly increasethe mobility o fthe rural residents
insearchoftrade, education andworking opportunities withthe outside world.

Selection of Roads

6.         The APCD prescreened 50 road segments as candidate roads for the proposed project and
17 roads (25 segments) were selected. Depending on the road's condition, the selected roads can
be dividedinto two differenttypes o f investments-rehabilitation        and improvement. The
economic analysis tested each road segment as well as the total project roads.

7.         All selected roads were either with a lower PQI(Pavement Quality Index) and/or with the
higher V/C value (traffic density). The other main selection criteria were:

           (a)  The roads were located inpoverty areas and/ or mountainous regions.

           (b) The technical standards ofthe roads were low and without the services over 8 years.

           (c)  The roads connect to Jiangsu or Zhejiang provinces with low traffic design capacity
                and hightraffic volume (over 5000 vehicles per day).

           (d) The roadpavements were badly damaged with the traffic over 1,000 vehicles per
                day.

           (e)  The roadwas a missinglink or a bottleneck o fthe provincial main truck road.

           (0   Minimized environmental and/or resettlement impacts.

The Traffic

8.         The traffic census for the proposedroads was made onthe basis ofroutine traffic counts
and a comprehensive origin and destination (O/D) survey that took place in2005 (updated in
November 2006). Projections o f normal, generated and diverted traffic were made for about 300
zones on the basis o f a conventional growth model. The overall traffic growth rates for long-
term (1995 -2006) and short-term (2000-2006) were quite similar. Only inthe last 6 years, the
growth rate for buses and trucks traffic was faster then before. However, the main growth force
i s still the car. This trend i s expected to be maintained in the future. The projected traffic
growth rates are estimatedto be 5.1% per year in2006 2012, 3.3% in2012-2020, and 1.7% in
                                                            -
2020-2030. The overall traffic growth rates are summarized as follows:

9.      Alignment Alternatives: There was no alternative alignment issue for the rehabilitation
roads, because all the works will take place within the existing alignment. For the improvement
roads, the alternatives alignments were tested for each of the road segments and it was found that
the proposedalignment was welljustified on the basis of the local economic development, the
lowest engineering cost and the higher EIRR. The other major criteria for selection of an
alternative were to seek an alignment that would: (a) avoid areas which have complex conditions
geologically; (b) avoid the possible engineeringdifficulties; and (c) coordinate the comments
from the local governments and peoples. Details are available inthe feasibility study reports.

10.     The generatedtraffic was assumedto be 10percent of the normal traffic. This
assumptionis consistent with the experienceon other recenthighway projects inChina. No
diversion oftraffic from the railway to the new highway was taken into account, because not
every road has aparallel railway inthe project site and the railway carries mainly the long
distance traffic while the highway services mainly for local traffic with a muchshorter distance.
In2005, for example, the averagetransport distancefor the railway freight andpassenger were
85 1km and 863 km, respectively. Duringthe same period, the average transport distances for
highway freight andpassenger were 85 kmand 70 km, respectively. Inaddition, the much
higher highway tariff (0.40-0.50 RMB/t-km) also does not encouragetraffic diversion from the
railway (0.15- 0.25 RMB/t-km). Table A10.2 summarizesthe traffic census and forecast with
the lengthof each road segment.

11.      The Economic Cost: Investmentcosts were converted to economic costs by the
elimination o fprice contingency, taxes, custom duty on imported materials and by the
application o f shadow price factors. The resultingoverall economic cost i s about 90 percent o f
the financial cost.

12.      The ProjectBenefits: Project benefitswere estimated by usingthe HDM-4. The
economic analysis includes the benefits derived from: (a) VOC savings on the new highway for
normal and generated traffic; (b) time and distance savings through relieved congestion on the
existing road; and (c) lower accident costs. The value of passenger time savings was estimated
at RMB 2.0 per passenger-hour, on the basis o f updated values from a report on feasibility study
methodology for highways in China. The same sources were used for vehicle accident rates on
different classed o froads. The vehicle fleet characteristics, economic cost androaduser costs
are summarized as follows:

16.     Inaddition, the sensitivity tests with variations incosts andbenefits ofthe project
indicate that the conditions for the project's viability to fall below the minimumacceptable, e.g.
a negative NPV by using 12% discount rate or an EIRR lower than 12%, are unlikely to occur.
Benefits would have to fall to less than 41.3% o f those inthe base case with no change incosts,
costs would have to increase to more than 2.42 times those o f the base costs, or costs would have
to increase by 45% and benefits fall to 60% at the same time. The results o f sensitivity tests

17.     Additional benefits, not included inthe EIRRcalculation, expected from the project are:
increase inthe income o f rural farmers, who live inthe poor and /or mountainous areas, because
o f better access to town marketsandjobs, and increased accessibility to schools and hospitals.
The quantifiable beneficiaries are estimated at: (a) about 5,600 extra childrenattending school
(average about 4.6 students per km inthe directly served areas); and (b) about 37,800 extra
peoples attending health services (average about 31.3 peoples per km would benefit the new

ProbabilisticRiskAnalyses

18.      The sensitivity test has various limitations. For example, the test cannot determine the
degree o f uncertainty; thus, a probabilistic risk analysis usingMonte Carlo techniques was
carried out. Each uncertainty factor i s randomly varied between set limits and all uncertainty
factors are allowed to change simultaneously. Monte Carlo simulation provides probability
distributions o f the potential outcomes o f decisions. By analyzing these distributions, the risk
associated with making various decisions (or probabilistic risk analysis) can be assessed. The
product of the analysis is ajudgment on the possible range o f the decision variable, and on the
likelihood o f each value within this range.

19.      The uncertainty factors associated with the economic evaluation o fthe project were
identified as: (a) traffic growth rate; (b) the value o f vehicle operating costs; (c) the changes o f
capital investment;and (d) delay the opening by one year. The results of probabilistic risk
analysis show that the EIRR for the most likely scenario i s 28.8%, the low scenario i s 21-4% and
the highscenario is 36.5%. The standard error ofthe meanis 0.5%. The detailed results ofthe
Monte Carlo test and probabilistic risk analyses are summarized as follows:

FINANCIAL EVALUATIONOF APCD

20.      The APCD provided its highway financing plan coving the 11th Five- Year Plan (FYP
2006 - 2010) and 12'h FYP (2011- 2015). The plan has three mainfeatures: (a) a decrease in
fundingto the new construction- from 76.2% of the total revenuein 1lth to 73.0% in 12th
                                                                                FYP
FYP; (b) an increase inmaintenance expenditures- from 8.7% o fthe total revenue in 11th FYP to


                                                   79

11.3% in 12`h FYP; and (c) a decrease inportion o f the M O C grants- from 21.1% o f the total
revenuein 11th FYPto 13.6% in 12`h FYP. During the same period, a moderate self- financing
ratio (total internal cash generation against total revenue) for 2011- 2015 (64.3%) will ensure the
implementation o f the development planeven without the grant from MOC. This ratio has
improvedby 11.1% from 53.2% for 2006 -2010.

21.     Interms ofthe long-term viability ofroadmaintenance with the resources allocated,
despite average 0.3% increases inthe road networks during2006 -2010, the average yearly
increase inmaintenance expenditures also increased by 9.0%. This means a net increase in
average maintenance expenditures per kilometer, from 11,650 RMB/km in 2006 to 16.460
RMB/kmin2010. This trend should continue from 2011-2015 (see Table A10.14 revenueand
expenditures2006-2015).

Fiscal Impact of the ProposedHighway Investments

low side because most o f the roads are Class I1and under. The financial evaluation o fthe
project roads are focused on APCD maintaining a sound financial practice to minimize the
financial risks, i.e. the lack o f counterpart funds for the construction, including the future
maintenance and operating expenses to the project roads as well as the loan repayments.

23.     The APCD budget forecasts show that the capital required for the investments,
maintenance and operations o f the project roads constitute only a small fraction o f APCD's fund
flow. Based on the APCD's plan, the annual capital investments o f the project roads will require
less than 6.6% o f the projected annual total APCD revenue in any given year during the
construction period. The total capital requiredfor the entire project represents only 3.4% o f the
total revenueduring 2007-2011. Inaddition, the annual maintenance and expenditure o f the
project roads i s less than 1.5% o f its annual budgeted maintenance expenditure. The total
maintenance required for the project roads represents only 1.0% o f the total budgeted
maintenance expenditures o f APCD in2007-201 1. These low ratios indicate that the project
presents a very modest financial risk with regards to the availability o f a counterpart funding for
the construction and the future maintenance and operating ofthe project roads. Summarized
these figures are summarized inTable A10.12.

24.      About 60% o fthe total project cost will be financed inthe form o f borrowings (the Bank,
about 40%, and the local banks about 22%). For the loan repayments, the APCD also budget
sufficient reserves to meet its financial obligations. In2012, for example, the total loan
repayment o f the project (principal and interest payments for foreign and domestic loans) i s
estimated to be Rh4B 267.7 1 million which constitutes only 19.1% of the total budgeted loan
repayment reserves (1,398 million RMB) o f the APCD inthat year. Compared to the total
revenueo f APCD, the total loanrepayments only weight 1.O%.              These low ratios indicate the
loan repayment o f the project will not generate any financial pressure on the APCD's cash flow.
It is estimated that the total the APCD budget (2006-2015) constitutes only about 8-12% o fthe
overall the government budget o f Anhui province. All the financial indicators show that the fiscal
impact and risks are modest. A detailed data are provided inTable A10.14 and summarized as

              CHINA: AnhuiHighwayRehabilitationandImprovementProject

Introduction

1.       When completed, the project will have (a) improved or upgraded about 320 kmo fkey
provincial and national roads (around 7 segments) located on the central-eastern and southeastern
areas o f the Province; and (b) supported the provincial rehabilitation and maintenance program
from 2007-2010 under the EFYP o f 18 segments, for about 890 km.

2.       Improvement works would include insome cases the duplication o f existing roads
following the same alignment with specific bypasses inbuilt-upareas (inorder to minimize
resettlement actions) or with short segments o f new alignments if necessary to avoid hard
topographical conditions. Intwo cases (roads S311 and S322), this component will include the
construction o f a limitednumber o f kilometers to increase the transport capacity o f the existing
corridor or complete missingsegments. Rehabilitation works o f improving pavement conditions
o f the roads by resurfacing and specific structural strengthening and limitedadjustments to the
alignment when requiredto riding conditions and improve safety.

3.       The project triggered and addressedthe following Bank safeguards: Environmental
Assessment (OP 4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP4.12). The project designincorporates
the mitigationmeasures for each policy, as described below.

5.       The project is classified as Category A due to the new construction segments involved in
the subproject of road S322, Taohuatan-Tangkou road, which will traverse a mountainous area of
highscenic value with tourism potential. Followingthe Bank's and Chinese EIA requirements,



                                                     83

full EIAshave been prepared for all the S322 and 6 road improvement subprojects; and a
simplifiedEIA for all the 18 roadrehabilitationsubprojects.

6.      Based on the 7 individual full EIAs and the simplified EIA, an Integrated Environmental
Assessment Report inEnglishhas been prepared for the entire road program under guidelines
and table o f contents agreed with the Bank.All environmental management o f construction
activities i s included ina comprehensive set o f technical environmental specifications that will
be included inall biddingdocuments and contracts.

7.      Environmental and Social Setting. Anhui Province is located inthe interior China, with a
total area o f 139,427 km2and the total population o f about 65 million. Anhui Province has a
complex topography, covering a wide range o f topographical features with mixed hills, plains
and low basins. From north to south, the province can be classified into five basic topographical
categories as Huaibei Plain, Jianghuai Hilly region, Dabieshan Mountainous region, Yanjiang
Plain and Wannan Mountainous region. Anhui province i s abundant inwater resource. There are
three major river systems passing through this province, i.e. Xinanjiang River, Yangzte River
and Huai River.

8.      Anhui Province is richinwildlife andplant resources. According to the statistics, there
are totally 3200 species of vascular plants, 2108 species o f herbs and 1300 species o f woody
plants. Inaddition, the statistics also shows that there are 509 species o f wild animals, 54 o f
which are nationally protected. Currently, there are 3 1 natural reserves inAnhui Province,
among which five are at the national level, 25, the provincial level and one, county level. The
total combinedarea o f all nature reserves i s 346,803 ha. It i s also rich intourism resorts,
including two World Natural Cultural Heritage Sites (Huangshan Mountain and Wannan Ancient
Residence Buildings) and a number o f national scenic areas and forest parks.

9.      Lying inthe heart o f easternpart o f China, Anhui Provinceranks the 22"d inlandarea in
China, with a population density three times o f the nation-wide average. It i s rich innatural
resources, particularly inmineral and tourism resources. However, its economic development i s
below the average nation-wide. Five project counties are among state-level poverty counties and
four districthounties are among provincial level poverty counties.

10.     Improving road network conditions i s a major task facing Anhui Province. Anhui
Province has already developed a road network o f a total lengtho f 72,807 km. However, roads
above Class I1accounts for only 15.8% and paved or simple-paved roads accounts for only 5 1%.
Overall, its state and provincial roads are o f low grade surface and mid and low class roads take
up a highproportion. Additionally, roaddevelopment is not balanced region-wise. The
mountainous areas inthe south and Dabieshan Mountainous areas have low and poor road access
and difficulty inroad transportation has not beenresolved. Some villages inthe mountainous
areas inthe poverty counties still do not have access to roads. No or poor road access i s the
primary factor constrainingthe social and economic development inthese project areas. For
example, 81% o f the interviewed villagers in Road S311 list improving road conditions as their
number one priority.




                                                  84

11.      The roadinfrastructure to be improvedor rehabilitated will be mostly locatedalongside
the existingalignments requiringonly the expansion ofthe ROW and acquisition o fadditional
land. The area o f the project i s heavily developed. There are no natural habitats or critical
natural habitats along the existing or future right o f ways. However, there still remain some
patches o f native vegetation, especially along S322 that still harbor some native species albeit
without any significant biodiversity value. There i s no evidence of paleontological or
archeological resources along the corridor. There are no indigenous peoples inthe area o f
influence of the project.

12.      Environmental and social baseline information i s thoroughly presentedinthe Integrated
EIA report. It is confirmedthat there are no protected areas or cultural sensitive site within the
impact scope o f the proposed subprojects.

13.      Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures. For all Road Rehabilitation
subprojects, most impacts will be circumscribed to existingright o f ways which will likely be
easily managed through sound engineering designand constructionpractices.

14.      For all road Improvement subprojects, the main impacts will be landacquisition for
bypassing or new construction sections, common construction relation impacts (e.g. dust, noise
soil erosion, water pollution, ecological protection, safety, social disturbance, traffic
management etc.), and noise and safety concerns during operation.

15.      For the new construction in S322, additional environmental issues include the expansion
o f the road in an urban area (800 m), crossing a highly unstable area (km 5 - km 6) and the need
for integrated landscape design (scenic area). Mitigation measures include special urbanworks
inits initial segment (sidewalks, pedestriancrossings, and bicycle paths), special construction
techniques incritical segment, and landscape design for the entire road. A special program to
provide technical assistance (to communities along the road will be included.

16.      These impacts and corresponding mitigation measures are thoroughly addressed inthe
individual EIA reports and summarized inthe Integrated EIA report. A comprehensive set o f
standardized Environmental Specifications were developed, with additional specific measures for
new construction and road improvement subprojects. These are summarized inthe tables at the
end o fthis Annex.

17.      Environmental ManagementPlan. The APCD has prepareda comprehensive and
detailed draft EMP inaccordance with Bank policy. The EMP addresses all potential
environmental and social issues o f concern and proposes adequate mitigation measures for each
negative impact identified as well as measures for enhancing each identified positive impact.
The EMP includes a summary chart where all the problems encountered and proposed mitigation
and enhancement measuresare mentioned, and their locationis provided inalignment sheets for
a1road improvements and new construction corridors. Monitoring and supervision
arrangements, as well as an institutional strengthening program for the APCD are also included
inthe EMP. Project bidding documents under preparation will include all specifications
regardingthese programs.

18.      Analysis o f Alternatives. For S322, two major alternative options were evaluated and
compared from environmental as well as the engineering aspects. These alternatives are:

         (a) Alternative I,the section from start point to K14+473, K27t-301 to end point
             K29+740, will be reconstructed to the Class I1road inhilly area, and the other
             sections (from K14+473-K27+301, abut 12.83 km)will be improved on road
             surface; and

         (b) Alternative 11: the road inwhole lengthwill be upgradedto Class I1road.

19.      After comparing alternatives, Alternative Iwas recommended due to avoidance o fa
tunnel andrelated spoiled soil disposal, less environmentally sensitive receptors andthus less
impacts to the environment and ecosystem, less investment and still meeting demand o f
projected traffic forecast.

20.      Inthe first 3.1 kmo fthe proposed road section, K0+000 to K3+100, and 3.2 kmat
K16+400 to K19+600, there are existing roads o f basically gravel pavement and 6-7 m wide.


                                                  86

Along the existing road there are residential houses. Improvement o f the road on the existing
pavement would result in increased noise, air emission and traffic safety concerns. But the area i s
along Qingyijiang River with valuable cultivated and highly productive land. Avoiding the
existing road would mean to occupy agriculture land, affecting farming and agricultural
ecological system. Inaddition, exiting road improvement would bringother benefits for the
residents living near road: increased property value, income opportunities, and future
developments. And yet, there are engineering considerations for smooth alignment, good
configuration, and minimumengineering costs. With all these considerations, for the first section
o f the road, most part will be along the existingroadwith some exceptions which to be
constructed on green field. For example, section K2+860 to K3+410 go through the middleo f
Lianhong village. The road at this section will be detoured to the left avoiding going through the
village which would have substantial disturbance to village life.

21.      Besides S322, alternative alignment analysis was also conducted for small sections
(bypasses) for S3 11 Chuzhou-Wuyi, G205 Caijiaqiao-Tanjiaqiao, S105 Chaohu-Wujiang, G205
Tangkou-Qiankou, and G205 Tunxi-Provincial Border. The final selection was based on
integrated consideration o f technical, environmental and social criteria, i.e. avoidance o f
environmentally sensitive areas, less social interference and resettlement, shorter length, less
landoccupation, and compatibility with local master planning.

22.      Public Consultation and InformationDisclosure. According to the World Bank's
safeguard policies, two rounds o fpublic consultation were carried out for all subprojects during
the EIA preparation. The first round was conducted duringa site survey, inSeptember, 2006.
The secondround was after the completion ofthe draft EIA report, inOctober 2006. The
consultation was conducted usinga combination o fpublic meeting, individual interview, and
information disclosure and questionnaire survey. Inaddition, a hot line was set up duringthe
project development to enhance the communication between the affected people and the EA
team. There were total about 850 people involved inthe public consultationprocess.

23.      The main concerns from public include landcompensation, safety o f construction,
damage to irrigation facilities, community severance, noise etc., for which proper mitigation
measures are developed inthe EMP.

24.      According to the OP 4.01 requirements, relevant project information were disclosed to
the public indifferent stages ofthe EA process. Duringthe first round of public consultation,
booklets were distributed among the residents along the project road to introduce the project
components, necessity and alignment, as well as the potential environmental impacts associated
with the project. The APCD also placed the draft EIA report inselected townships and counties
o f the project areas. Inaddition, public bulletins were distributedalong the project roads to
promulgate the brief information and the project and the location to review the draft ETA report.
The draft EIA report and other relevant informationwere also disclosed throughthe APCD
website at www.ahg;li.com on October 30, 2006, and incounty libraries, township government
offices and selected local schools on March 23,2007.

ResettlementAction Plan(RAP)

25.     Background. Resettlementimpact i s only expected under the improvement component.
The APCD engaged Anhui the Province Communications Design Institute and East China
Planning & DesignInstituteto carry out the resettlement planning. The two design institutes,
together with local governments, carried out the impact inventory and census surveys during
August-November 2006. At the same time, a socio-economic survey was carried out inthe
project areas. These studies contributedto the resettlement planning. Four resettlement action
plans encompassing the entire project were prepared.

26.     Project Impacts. The main project impacts are landacquisition and house demolition.
The project will require6,550 muo f land, including 4,560 muo f cultivated lands. The
acquisition o f this landwill affect about 2,875 households (about 10,408 people). The project
will also requirethe acquisition ofhouses for a total of 31,194 m2, affecting 680 people in 175
households. About 20 small shop businesses will be affected as well.

27.     Basic Principles. The RAP i s prepared inline with Chinese laws, regulations and World
Bank Operational Policy OP 4.10. The following principles were followed:

             Land acquisition and relocation should be minimized through engineering, technical
             measures. Ifunavoidable, necessary measures should be planned;

             Compensation will be paid at replacement cost;

             Resettlement planning, based on the actual inventory and agreed compensation rates,
             should aim at improving, or at least restoring livelihoods for the affected;

            Approach for livelihood restoration will be land-based;

            Resettlers and the host population should be encouragedto participate inthe
            resettlement planning process; and

            Priority should be given inconsideration to resettlement within existing
            communities.

28.     Livelihood Rehabilitation. The planning team worked with the affectedvillages to
develop their livelihood rehabilitationprogram. Planning meetings were held inevery village to
review the village impact, village resources potentials for development, their willingness and
capabilities for various options. A village livelihood development strategy and options were
formulated through these working meetings. The rehabilitation strategy follows a combination
o f land-for-land measures and cash payment option. All affected villages have developed
livelihood plans based on their resources available and their preference. Redistribution o fthe
remaining village land i s the primary measure. Invillages where land loss i s marginal and
farmers prefer cash compensation to going through the process o f land redistribution, cash
compensation will be provided as an option. These are detailed inthe RAPs.

29.     Relocation. The project will needto relocate 175 households and they are all scattered
among the proposed roads. They are planning to move all within their existing villages and no
group resettlement sites are considered necessary. The relocating households will be responsible
for their own house constructionwith the compensation fund and allowances. The project offices
and local governments would assist them inhousehold plot selection, development and house
construction.

30.     Rehabilitation o f Infrastructureand Businesses. The project affected infrastructure i s
mainly power and telecommunications lines. These facilities will be compensated at
reconstruction cost and will be reconstructed by the owner government departments. All
affected businessare small family business and shops. They will be compensated and helpedin
their reestablishment close by.

3 1.    Resettlement Organization. The APCD i s incharge o f the implementation o f the
resettlement program. A multi-level resettlement organizationhas been established for the
implementation o f the project, including resettlement offices at provincial, municipal, county and
township levels. These offices will employ competent and experienced staff. Their respective
responsibilities and functions are detailed inthe RAPs. Training will be provided to the project
staff.

32.     Monitoring and Evaluation. Both internal and external monitoring i s planned for
resettlement implementation. The resettlement offices will be responsible for the internal
monitoring. Anhui Communication College will be appointed as the independent monitor for the
implementation o f the resettlement program. The monitoring scope, targets, indicators,
procedures, methodology and reporting requirementsare described inthe RAP.

33.     Implementation Schedule. The exact project impacts will be verified and finalized when
engineeringconstructiondrawings are completed. The RAP inventory and budgetas well as the
resettlement cost will be updated accordingly. RAP implementation will be aligned with civil
works construction. The process for acquisition, detailed livelihood planning, house
construction, relocation and infrastructure reconstruction i s detailed inthe RAP.

34.     Public Consultation and Participation. The resettlement planningfollowed a
participatory process. Affected villagers and various government agencies participatedinthe
social economic survey, impact survey and formulation o f the compensatory and livelihood

rehabilitationplan. These are described inthe RAP. The affected people will continue to
participate inthe formulation and implementation o f detailed village livelihood development
plans. Arrangements to ensure continued participation are planned inthe RAP. Project
information, relevant government policies and regulations were broadly disseminated through
village meetingsinthe project areas. Project RAPSwere also disclosed inproject county
libraries and local project offices for public review and feedback. Their availability, project
contact person, telephone numberwere announced inAnhui Daily on March 23,2007.

35.     Grievance Redress. A mechanism has been established for grievance redress.
Grievances can be filed both orally and inwriting. Starting at village level, the grievances can
be elevated to township, county, city and provincial level ifthey are not satisfied with the
resolution at the lower level. The affected people could also resort to the courts ifthey are not
satisfied with the resolution by the project authority. All grievances and their resolutions will be
recorded. This mechanism has beendisclosed to the local population and will be further
disseminated through the Resettlement Information Booklet.

36.     Resettlement Cost. The total resettlementcost i s RMB 165 million, equivalent to US$21
million (US$1 = 7.8 RMB). This budget includes the compensation fund for land, houses and
attached structures, infrastructure and trees, various relocation allowances, business loss during
transition, special allowance for vulnerable groups, management and monitoring costs,
contingencies as well as relevant taxes. All resettlement costs will be financed by domestic
funding,
