16MORNDWM AND UECOKOENDAtION OF THE PRXIDENT
OF THE INTEUNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO TIIR )CUTIE DIRECTORS
FOR A PROPOSED CREDIT TO TUE GOVERiNMET OF MINYA
FOR A FINANCI. PARASTATALS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Kenya for SDR 4.7 million (USS 6.0 million equivalent)
is submitted for approval. The proposed Credit would be on standard IDA
terms with 40 years maturity and would help finance a technical assistance
project for the restructuring of two major financial parastatals--Industrial
Development Bank (IDB) and Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation
(ICDC). The proceeds of the Credit would be utilized partly by the
Borrower--the Ministry of Finance, while the major part would be made
available by the Borrower as a grant to IDB and ICDC.
2.        Background.  Although Kenya has one of the most diverse and
dynamic financial systems in Sub-Saharan Africa, the availability of long-
term funds, both loans and equity, continues to be limited. This gap can be
attributed to both structural and policy-induced factors, especially the
existence of interest rate and credit ceilings, and uncertain implementaticri
of the legal framework for financial transactions. The Government of Kenya
(GOK) has embarked upon major reforms to address these sectoral problems.
GOK's financial sector &dJustment program, which is supported by two IDA
credits that became effective in 1989, includes the deregulation of interest
rates (before mid-1991), actions to restructure weak private sector finan-
cial institutions, and implementation of a new Banking Act to strengthen the
legal framework.
3.        More recently, GOK expanded this reform agenda to include issues
of financial market segmentation--due mainly to the preferential treatment
of selected parastatal institut3ons..-and the sustainability of development
finance institutions (DFIs). Since 1963, six major DFIs--five of which are
parastatals--have been established to support investment, production and
employment in the major sectors of the economy. Despite representing less
than 8 percent of banking system assets, they have filled an important gap
in the provision of term loans and equity, in which areas there has been
little involvement by other financial institutions. Nevertheless, they have
proved to be generally unprofitable, requiring periodic injections of funds
from the Government and external donors to continue operations. Among
industrial sector DFIs, the three parastatals--IDB, ICDC and Kenya
Industrial Estates (KIE)--now face serious operational and portfolio
problems.
4.        An evaluation by consultants, completed under the Industrial
Sector Adjustment Credit (ISAC)--IDA Credit 1927-KE, and complementary
information from project experience and sector studies, suggest several
reasons for the current condition of the industrial sector DFIs. Policy-
related and strategic deficiencies in their roles; financing arrangements
that incorporate asset/liability mismatches; internal structural flaws; and
inadequate information, control and analytical processes have circumscribed
their effectiveness and affected their balance sheets adversely. Radical
measures are required to establish their commercial viability and long-term



- 2 -
sustainability, and to enable them to compete effectively with new entrants
in their traditional market segment. Also, changes in the operation of the
DFIs would help reduce the burden on the Government budget, and eliminate
the segmentation of the financial market that results from their targeted
credit and investment programs.
5.        GOK and IDA have conducted an intensive dialogue on these issues.
From a systemic viewpoint, a reduction in the number of DFIs is required.
The Government has been urged to discontinue RIE's small-scale lending role,
limiting it to the continued provision of technical serviceL, training, and
physical facilities for small enterprises. A discussion of the future role
of the Agricultural Finance Corporation has been initiated in the context of
an IDA sector report on rural finance. With respect to IDB and ICDC, the
evaluation by external consultants established their potential viability,
and showed a continuing need for the type of financial services they
provide. Their effectiveness and competitive position can, however, be
enhanced with appropriate policies to ensure financial sustainability. The
Government has prepared a proposal for reforming its strategy towards these
institutions to ensure effectiveness, commercial operation, and long-term
sustainability. A broad restructuring plan covering revised mandates,
funding, strategy, organization and the lending/investment process within
these institutions was completed io October 1989 in compliance with
conditions for the release of the second tranche of ISAC. Subsequently,
actions have been taken to revise operational mandates, reconstitute the
governing boards, and review staff capabilities and needs for IDR and ICDC.
The Government intends further to: change the internal organization of these
DFIs to improve accountability for portfolio management and institute a
competitive and performance-oriented incentive mechanism; restructure
balance sheets through a phased program of divestiture and consolidation of
assets, and assumption of the foreign exchange risk on their liabilities;
initiate corporate workouts among client firms; improve investment and
collection practices; and establish mechanisms to ensure commercial and
self-sustaining operations (including explicit compensation from GOK's
budget if the DFIs are rejuired to participate in projects that they would
not normally support on commercial grounds). Other external donors have
been urged to undertake a similar restructuring of the smaller Development
Finance Corporation of Kenya (DFCK), in which they have majority equity
interest.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The action plans for restructuring
the DFIs are critical to maintaining the success of the Government's adjust-
ment program. The ability of Kenyan enterprises to respond to improvements
in the policy environment will be determined partly by the availability of
long-term debt and equity financing, which are currently unavailable t
other financial institutions. The plans also form an integral part of IDA's
industrial and financial sector development strategy for Kenya, which has
been supported by three IDA credits--ISAC, Financial Sector Adjustment
Credit (FSAC) and Financial Sector Technical Assistance Credit (FSTAC).
Both IDB and RIE have been past recipients of IDA credits. Financial
restructuring was a precondition for the extension of a second IDA credit to
KIE in 1986, but has not proven to be very successful. The actions being



proposed currently are more radical in nature and have emerged out of
lessons learned from the KIE experience and from the broader program of
sectoral adjustment for industry and finance. However, technical resources
required for implementing the proposals are not currently available within
the DPIs or the Government.
7.        Proiect Objectives.  The Government has adopted a framework for
DPI restructuring, and the main principles and components of the program
have been agreed with IDA. The proposed IDA project would assist in
implementing action plans for IDB and ICDC. The action plans are intended
to establish self-sustaining and commercially viable institutions, and to
give them the operational flexibility to develop appropriate market niches
and diversification strategies to compete effectively with banks and near-
banks when the financial market is eventually liberalized. These plans
include: restructuring the assets and liabilities of the two DFIs;
introducing a revised organizational structure that enhances staff autonomy
and accountability; improving credit management and information processes;
and assisting in turning around potentially viable client firms held in
their portfolios. Further, through coordinated training, incentives and
staff retention policies, the project would improve indigenous capacities to
manage financial institutions.
8.        Prolect Description.  The project consists of three components:
technical support for the implementation of restructuring plans for IDB and
ICDC; the design of corporate workouts for client firms; and training for
staff of these DFIs. For the first component, the project would finance the
services of eight long-term consultants and three desktop computers and
accessories (US$ 3.49 million). Consultants would assist in the following
areas: (i) Liabilities management - to restructure the foreign exchange
exposure and domestic liabilities of the DYIs, and implement appropriate
financial provisions; (ii) Assets management - to design and Implement a
divestiture program for assets held in their portfolios; (iii) Operations
management - to assist the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of the DFIs with
corporate planning and all aspects of operations; (iv) Human resources
development - to implement the personnel policies implied by the revised
organizational structures of the DFIs, and to develop a training program for
staff; and (v) Systems management - to design and suDervise the implementa-
tion of an improved credit/investment process (prepa ition, appraisal,
approval, monitoring, closure) and supporting information requirements. The
second component of the project (US$ 1.45 million) would finance: (i) Short-
term consultancies to undertake analyses and prepare corporate restructuring
plans for approximately 25 potentially viable but non-performing enterprises
carried on the DPI portfolios; (ii) Legal assistance to the DFIs for revis-
ing agreements with client firms; and (iii) Establishment of a panel of
internationally-reputed experts to assist the DFIs periodically with
strategic planning. Finally, the project would support overseas and local
training in basic financial and marketing skills for suitably qualified
staff from these institutions (US$ 1.06 million). The DFIs would provide
budgetary and other resources for local support services and in-house
training.

9.        Agreed Actions.  The following restructuring actions have been
completeds (i) initial classification of the DFI portfolios to identify
assets for divestiture and to isolate non-cammercial projects which would
receive direct subventions from the GOR Budget; (ii) reconstitution of the
governing boards of IDB and ICDC, reducing Guvernment representation to one
member, establishment of new criteria to ensure greater professional
participation, and official (i.e. gazette) notification of the new
composition of the governing boards; (iii) redefinition of the roles and
responsibilities of the CEOs of the DFIs; (iv) initipt inventory of human
resources at the two institutions, evaluated according to performance
criteria; (v) agreement on criteria for assumption by GOK of the foreign
exchange risk on the external liabilities of ICDC and TDB; and (vi)
ratification of the principles and specific components of the project by the
reconstituted boards of IDB and ICDC. Agreement on the following actions
was reached during negotiations: (i) a ceiling on the share of new funds to
be invested annually by the DFIs in non-commercial government-directed
projects, and on the size of the annual Budget subvention to compensate the
DFIs for undertaking such projects, would be determined by end-March each
year; (ii) within two months of the start of assignments, the long-term
consultants recruited under the   oject would complete inception reports to
better define work programs; (iiLj IDB and ICDC would complete comprehensive
business plans, includixg monitorable financial targets, and review them
with IDA before June 30, 199,; (iv) an external advis'ry panel for the DPIs
would be appointed before December 31, 1990; and (v) the training
performance and plans, tncluding in-house training, of IDB and ICDC would be
reviewed annually with IDA.
10.       Benefits.  Economic benefits under the proposed project are
expected from: (a) elimination of the need for period': capital injections
for the two DFIs from the GOK Budget or external dor a; (b) reduction in
financial market segmentation and an increase in c%   tition; (c) restruc-
turing of potentially viable productive enterprises lad (d) improvements in
the skill levels of staff employed in the two DFIs. In addition, the
establishment of viable and commerciallv-oriented v: :s would improve
resource allocation in the industrial sector, and facilitate the development
of indigenous capacities and improved operating practices in the Kenyan
financial system.
11.       Risks.  Possible risks includes  (a) inability of DPI staff and
management to adapt to the proposed portfolio management approach, absorb
the skills required to manage commercial operations, and implement their new
mandates; (b) inability of the Government to compensate the DFIs adequately
for undertaking non-commercial operations; and (c) inability of the DFIs to
generate sufficient cash for operations during the period of restructuring
due to problems with divestiture and consolidation of assets. To minimize
these risks, the project provides for: (a) early ratification of the
restructuring plans by the DFIs' governing boards, and emphasis on training
of DFI staff and the provision of suitably-qualified long-term advisors; (b)
specific agreement with the Government on the level of compensation to be
provided to the DFIs; and (c) a phased program of asset and liability



restructuring, to be managed at the Ministry of Finance by well-qualified
consultants. and including actions for Government to assume the foreign
exchange risk associated with the liabilities of the two DFIs.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recomuend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.

TICEIC^AL ANNX
SECTION At DETAILED PROJECT DSCUIPMION
Background
1.        Although Kenya's growth rates since 1965 have been higher than
those achieved by most Sub-Saharan African countries, they have been built
on a narrow base of traditional production and entrepreneurship. To
accelerate the pace of development and diversify its sources, economic
policies have in the past been directed towards the creation of
opportunities for import substitution behind high tariff and non-tariff
barriers. In addition, a variety of economic and non-economic objectives,
including a rapid increase in domestic investment, have been targeted. To
achieve these objectives, numerous attempts have been made to remove real or
perceived distortions in the operation of the economy, and to accord
preferential treatment to selected groups and sectors.
2.        The establishment of foreign joint-venture and parastatal DFIs was
an integral part of this strategy. Although Kenya has one of the most
diverse and dynamic financial systems in Sub-Saharan Africa, the
availability of long-term funds, in the form of loans as well as equity,
continues to be limited. This gap in the availability of financial services
can be attributed to both structural and policy-induced factors, especially
the existence of interest rate and credit ceilings and weaknesses in the
legal framework for the enforcement of financial contracts. The Government
of Kenya (GOK) has embarked upon major reforms to address these problems.
The financial sector adjustment program, supported by two IDA credits which
became effective in 1989 (IDA Credits 2049-RE and 2058-RE), includes a
progressive deregulation of interest rates, an improved legal and regulatory
framework, strengthened prudential supervision and monetary control, and the
restructuring of insolvent private sector financial institutions. More
recently, GOK has expanded this reform agenda by focussing on issues of
financial market segmentation--the result mainly of preferential treatment
of selected parastatal institutions--and the sustainability of DFIs, which
have required frequent injections of funds in the past from the Government
and other shareholders to maintain operations.
3.        Despite individual client firm successes, Kenya's industrial
sector DFIs have shown weak aggregate financial results. The three largest
public sector institutions--Industrial Development Bank (IDB, with total
assets of about USS 65 million), Industrial and Commercial Development
Corporation (ICDC, US$ 62 million) and Kenya Industrial Estates (KIE, US$ 36
million)--now face serious portfolio problems. The absence of clear
mandates, weak accountability, and poor financial practices have contributed
to these problems. Under present conditions, it is unlikely that the DFIs--
including the Development Finance Corporation of Kenya (DFCK), a DPI with
majority ownership by external donors including IFC--can provide the level
of domestic term finance required to support the Government's industrial and



- 12 -
trade sector adjustment programs. It is also evident that they would be
unable to compete effectively with other financial institutions if the
current program of interest rate liberalization and financial restructuring
eventually encourages new entrants into this market segment.
4.        GOK has formulated a comprehensive restructuring plan for IDB and
ICDC, and has taken early actions to change the mandates of these
institutions, reconstitute their governing boards, complete an initial
classification of their assets, and initiate performance evaluations of
their staff. The foreign shareholders of DFCK have been urged to take
similar actions. KIE undertook a financial restructuring prior to approval
of a second IDA credit to it in 1986, but the measures taken at that time,
and subsequently through the use of technical assistance funds provided in
the credit, have not proven successful. The commitment date on funds for
sub-projects under the credit, which expired at end-1989, was not extended
by IDA. The Government has been urged to discontinue KIE's lending role,
limiting it to the continued provision of technical services, training and
physical facilities for small enterprises.
5.        The Government has recognized that weaknesses in the operation of
the industrial sector DFIs stem from three major sources:
(a) Policy-related and strategic deficiencies in the role of the DFIs
(e.g. confusion about the objectives and performance parameters
inherent in the DFIs' complex mandates; their financing
arrangements which incorporate asset/liability mismatches; a
failure to recycle funding and maximize earnings; adherence to
limited and traditional lending and investment approaches);
(b) Internal structural flaws (e.g. a functional approach to
investments that compartmentalizes the investment process; absence
of accountability; lack of an appropriate incentive system);
5c) Inadequate information systems and analytical processes (e.g. weak
management information systems, and monitoring and supervision of
client firms; absence of business plans with specific timetables
for restructuring potentially viable client firms).
6.        To address the problems identified above, GOK's restructuring
proposals incorporate major reforms in mandates, autonomy, funding.
organization and lending/investment processes. The long-term objective with
respect to the DFIs is to establish commercial institutions that complement
the role of other financial institutions in Kenya in providing critical
financial services. Sustainability has been established as the overarching
objective for IDB and ICDC. In practice, this would mean movement along
four major fronts. First, sustainability will require an appropriate
funding base for the DFIs. Second, it will require achievement of a rate of
profitability on successful investments that matches returns elsewhere in
the financial sector; is adequate to finance new investments and loans; and
allows the DFIs to withstand income fluctuations from external shocks.
Third, sustainability will require the Government to stop viewing the DFIs



- 13 -
as costless policy delivery vehicles; instead GOK would reimburse the DFIs
in those cases where the activities or financing requested of the DFIs could
not be justified on a commercial basis. Finally, the DFIs will be required
to have a greater focus on complementing the private sector through improved
identification and funding of potentially viable but underserviced
enterprises, and by pursuing initiatives that aid the development of Kenya's
capital markets.
Project Ob ectives
7.       The action program prepared by GOK to restructure the major
industrial DFIs constitutes a set of radical proposals that build on the
experience gained through previous attempts to restructure IDB and KIE,
while preparing for the transition to more competitive financial markets.
The specific objectives of the Project are to implement these proposals
through a restructuring of the mandates, governance, portfolios, and
internal organization and processes of IDB and ICDC. The Project is also
designed to help in the rehabilitation of potentially viable but
underperforming industrial firms currently in the DFIs' portfolios. This
would enable IDB and ICDC to strengthen their financial condition, as well
as allow distressed firms to expand production and employment. Finally,
through coordinated training, incentives and staff retention policies, the
Project would improve indigenous capacities to manage financial
institutions.
Project Description
8.        The Government's preparation of the DFI restructuring program was
agreed and funded under the Industrial Sector Adjustment Credit (IDA Credit
1927-KE), which became effective on August 11, 1988. A comprehensive study
was prepared by consultants, and most of its recommendations were
incorporated into action plans agreed with IDA in fulfillment of one of the
second tranche release conditions under the credit. Subsequently, GOK
requested IDA assistance in identifying and financing the technical services
required to achieve the objectives of the restructuring proposals.
Agreement on the scope, delivery mechanism and timing of technical
assistance was reached during a mission in December 1989. Subsequently,
agreement was reached on outline terms of reference for consultants to be
recruited under the proposed Project.
9.        The proposed Project consists of three major components:
(a) Technical assistance in restructuring the DFIs: Eight (8)
long-term consultants will be selected to assist the Ministry
of Finance, IDB and ICDC in the implementation of the
restructuring proposals. Two (2) consultants will be based
at the Ministry of Finance for assignments of 12 months each,
and will undertake the following tasks--(i') Liabilities
management: to design and implement a strategy for the



- 14 -
assumption by GOK of the foreign exchange risk on existing
liabilities of the DFIs and for managing future liabilities,
and to implement appropriate financial provisions by the
DPIs; and (ii) Assets management: to design and implement a
selective divestiture program for marketable assets held in
the portfolios of the DPFs (approximately 472 of the total
assets of the two institutions), assist in the establishment
of mechanisms and budgetary compensation rules to manage
government-directed non-commercial operations (estimated at
approximately 252 of the total assets of the two
institutions), and to structure and complete the first public
divestiture of investments. In addition, the Project will
support the recruitment of three consultants for each DFI,
for individual assignments cf 24 months. The consultants
will assist the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of IDB and
ICDC in the following areast  (i) Operations management:
corporate planning and operations, including the evaluation
and design of risk positions, oversight of treasury
operations, asset-liability coordination, product
development, marketing, divestiture, internal audit, and
client firm restructuring; (ii) Human resources development:
including design and implementation of internal
organizational changes, establishment of job descriptions and
evaluation criteria, recruitment, and the assessment of
training needs, design of in-house training programs, and
selection of staff for external training; and (iii) Systems
management: including the desipn and implementation of
procedures for project management and information and
reporting systems, and assessment of office technology and
systems training needs. Three desk-top computers, including
printers, software, tape backup and power supplies, would be
provided to the consultants to assist them in performing
their tasks. In addition to the financing of long-term
consultants and equipment to be used by them, the Project
makes a provision for periodic assistance to the two
institutions by a panel of internationally-reputed
development tinance experts.
(b)  Technical assistance in preparing restructuring plans:   An
analysis of the performance of firms carried on the
portfolios of IDB and ICDC showed that of 159 firms surveyed,
nearly a third were judged to be potentially viable but
currently underperforming, while the remainder were either
well-performing firms or those which had largely been
undertaken for non-commercial reasons. The restructuring of
potentially viable enterprises is essential not only from the
point of view of restoring the DFI balance sheets to
profitability, but also to improve industrial efficiency and
increase production and employment. The Project will provide
funds for consultants to undertake financial, managerial and
technical analyses to assist in the restructuring of



- 15 -
approximately 25 of this group of client firma. It is
expected that eacb firm-level study would require the
services of two consultants in the areas mentioned above,
each for a period of two (2) months. In addition, the
Project would make provisions for assisting the DFIs in
revising legal agreements with client firms and creditors.
(c)  Training:  The establishment of more systematic human
resource development programs is essential for upgrading the
quality of services and financial practices at IDB and ICDC.
The Project would support the design and implementation of a
comprehensive training program within each DPI. Training
would consist, at each institution, of overseas graduate
education for approximately five (5) senior staff members,
and participation in short-term professional courses in Kenya
(50) and abroad (20). A prelimAnary evaluation of training
needs shows that programs in the following areas are
critical: marketing of financial services, divestiture
strategies, foreign exchange management, negotiation, general
management, and procurement. Further, in view of the need
for greater staff participation at all levels in the
implementatIon of the proposed portfolio management approach,
conventional courses in accounting and project appraisal
would need to expanded. IDB and ICDC would provide adequate
budgets for the in-house training of staff, and necessary
equipment and facilities to support this type of training.
Proiect Issues
10.       Counterpart Trainings:  The selection of counterparts and their
retention in jobs for which they are trained is critical to the success of
the Project. Detailed selection criteria and terms of reference would be
developed to ensure the quality of counterpart staff, and incentives would
be maintained at levels that are adequate to retain staff in the DFIs.
Provision has been made for the phased withdrawal of long-term consultants
from their assignments at each DFI, and for at least one subsequent visit of
short duration to provide troubleshooting assistance if required.
11.       Use of Local Consultants:   Although it is likely that the long-
term consultants, selected under the Project through standard Bank
procedures, would be expatriates, an attempt would be made to involve a
large number of local short-temn consultants in conducting the financial,
managerial, and technical analyses of the DPIs' client firms. In view of
the detailed technical, market- and country-specific experience required to
conduct such firm-level studies, it is expected that these corporate workout
teams would be composed of a mixture of expatriate and Kenyan consultants.
12.       Funding Structure:   A preliminary analysis showed that an
appropriate mix of balance sheet restructuring, including the divestiture
and rehabilitation of assets and the assumption by GOK of foreign exchange



- 16 -
liabilities, would strengthen the financial condition of IDB and ICDC.
Nevertheless, an expansion of their activities would require access to
additional and new sources of funding. Decisions regarding such funding
would depend critically on the nature of fJnancial products the restructured
DFIs would offer, and future financial market conditions. Accordingly, the
management of funding strategies would be an important element in the work
programs of the operations management advisors to be located at each DPI,
although assistance in formulating broad strategies may also be initiated at
an earlier stage by the long-term advisors to be located in the Ministry of
Finance.
13.       DFI Performance Monitoring:   Periodic evaluations of the effect
of the technical assistance activities covered by the Project would be
required to ensure the achievement of objectives. The training performance
and plans, including in-house training, of the two institutions would be
reviewed annually with IDA. An advisory panel consisting of
internationally-reputed experts in development finance would be constitute!
before December 31, 1990, to provide general guidance on strategic issues.
in addition, comprehensive business plans, including medium-term financial
targets, would be established for the two institutions by June 30, 1991, and
would be evaluated jointly by GOK and IDA.
SECTION B.  PROJECT AIMIISTRATION AND IPL3IEUT&TION
Pro3ect Implementation
14.       Overall responsibility for implementing the Project will rest with
the Ministry of Finance, while specific components will be overseen jointly
with the governing boards of IDB and ICDC. The Permanent Secretary,
Ministry of Finance, would be solely responsible for the components related
to: designing an overall divestiture strategy for DPI assets, lcluding
public issues; assumption by GOK of the foreign exchange risk on the
external liabilities of the DFIs; and implementing mechanisms for the
isolation of non-commercial projects currently carried on the DFI portfolios
and for compensating the DFIs appropriately for undertaking such projects in
the future. Together with the governing boards of 1DB and ICDC, the
Permanent Secretary would also be responsible for approving business plans,
setting financial targets, organizing periodic guidance to the DFIs by the
international panel of experts, identifying the specific firms to be
included in the corporate workout exercise, and supervising the work
programs of the consultants placed at the two DFIs.
Reporting, Accounts and Audits
15.       Separate accounts would be kept for all expenditures under the
Project. The Ministry of Finance will submit quarterly reports to IDA on
the progress of individual components. Accounts for each component would
also be submitted to IDA on a quarterly basis. The Ministry of Finance will



- 17 -
maintain records of all transactions under the Credit in accordance with
sound accounting practices. Not later than six months after the end of each
fiscal year of the Government, all accounts will be audited by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA and submitted to the Association. Audit reports
will include a separate opinion with regard to the claims submitted to IDA
on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOEs) and would state whether
such claims have been effected in accordance with the Credit Agreement.
Project Costs and Financing
16.       Total project costs are estimated at US$ 7.5 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$ 5.35 million, or 71 percent of
total costs. Cost estimates are based on April, 1990 prices. A contingency
of 15 percent was added for major cost categories to cover price and scope
changes during implementation of the Project. The Ministry of Finance, IDB
and ICDC would contribute US$ 1.5 million equivalent to cover local costs
incurred in the provision of support services and physical facilities for
consultants and in-house training for staff at the two DFIs. This
contribution accounts for 100 percent of total costs for in-house training,
49 percent of total costs for all training, und 20 percent of the total
costs of the project. A summary statement of the project budget is
presented below, with a detailed breakdown of costs provided in Schedule A

Project would be selected in accordance with Bank guidelines on the use of



- 18 -
consultants. Three packages of consultancy services will be prepared. The
first will consist of recruitment of exceptionally well-qualified
individuals to serve as liabilities and assets managers at the Ministry of
Finance. The second package would consist of recruitment of long-term
advisors to assist within the DFIs, and the third would consist o' a core
team to assist in corporate workouts. Internationally-reputed consulting
firms would be invited to provide the services required in the latter two
packages, and it is expected that consulting firms will bid separately for
each package. For purposes of control and effectiveness, the long-term
consultants recruited to assist each DPI with human resources development
would be responsible for selecting staff for external training, according
to criteria that would be agreed with IDA. Equipment to be procured under
the Project is for the use of the long-term consultants, and would consist
of three desk-top computers with monitors, printers, power supplies, other
accessories, and associated software. The equipment would be procured by
international shopping, with at least three price quotations received from
suppliers.
Disbursements
18.       Disbursements under the credit would be made against 100 percent
of expenditures for consultant services and external (both local and
overseas) training, and against 100 percent of foreign expenditures for
equipment. The Government and DFIs would finance 100 percent 'f the cost
of in-house training of staff, and office facilities and support services
for the consultants. Disbursements for external training would be made on
the basis of SOEs, and provisions for advance payment of per diem, travel
and fees would be made under the Credit.
Proiect Implementation Schedule
19.       The proposed Credit is expected to become effective by July 1,
1990. Initially, long-term advisors for liabilities and assets management
would be recruited to assist the Ministry of Finance. The advisors will
complete inception reports within two months of starting their assignments,
and these will be reviewed by GOK and IDA. If necessary, appropriate
modifications would be made at that time in the design of specific
assignments for all long-term advisors to be funded under the Credit.
Short- and long-term consultants to assist the DFIs with restructuring,
corporate workouts and training would be expected to be in place by
September, 1990. Project completion is expected to be December 31, 1993,
with the closing date being June 30, 1994.
