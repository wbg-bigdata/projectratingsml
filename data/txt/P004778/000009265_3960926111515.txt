MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND
FOR A RAILWAY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.       The fellowing memorandum and recowmendation on a proposed loan to the
State Railway of Thailand (SRT) for US$ 13.0 million equivalent is submitted
for approval. The loan would halp finance a railway efficiency improvement
pro4ect and would be for seventeen years including a four-year grace period,
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
2.       Background.  The Bank has been involved with railway development in
Thailand through five loans, the last of which closed on July 2, 1984. The
processing of a sixth railway project was shelved in 1983, primarily because
the Royal Thai Government (Government) was unwilling to agree to the
substantial tariff increase which the Bank considered necessary to imprcve
SRT's finances. Transport sector work wvs initiated in 1983 and completed in
1985 under the Bank's country economic and sector work program; Thailand
Transport Sector Review (Report No. 4950-TH) was circulated in grey cover in
June 1985. Railway was an important subsector component of this review. As a
follow-up on our sector work, a Bank mission was sent, in February 1985, to
assist the Government/SRT in preparing a plan of action aimed at improving
SRT's operations and finances and developing a railway investment strategy for
the Sixth Plan period (1987-1991). During that mission, the Government
expressed interest in Bank assistance in support of the Railway's investment
program.
3.       Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project is designed to help SRT
achieve some immediate improvement in its operations and financo. The ulti-
mate objective is to develop SRT into not only an operaticnally efficient
railroad, but also a financially viable one. In order for this long-term
program to be possible, the railroad must first clearly identify the marksets
that it can effectively and profitably serve. The primary objective of this
project is thus to identify those market segments and begin to strengthen
SRT's ability to compete with the other transport modes for traffic that it
can serve more efficiently and economically. The project will support
measures aimed at (i) realigning railway services to match changing demand;
(ii) increasing marketing and sales efforts; and (iii) reducing costs per
4         traffic unit through cost reduction and efficiency improvements.
4.       Project Description.  The proposed project is part of a comprehensive
program of technical, economic and finaucial improvements in the railway sub-
sector.  The core activity would be a major technical assistance and training
program concentrating on reducing the operating cost per traffic unit through
more efficient operations and increasing revenue by focusing the marketing and
sales organization toward intermodal (container freight traffic), medium and
long distance passenger traffic and those other market segments where SRT
possesses a comparative advantage over other modes of transportation. The
benefits of this project should become apparent in about two years, and will
become the foundation for a major reorientation of SRT's operating and mainte-
nance procedures. The project components are:



- 2 -
(a) technical assistance to SRT in the following areas: management
information system, freight and passenger marketing, equipment
rationalization, and procedures to impro-ve the planning and opera-
tions of the mechanical and civil engineering departments;
(b) training of railway staff in the areas of the technical assistance
presented above; and
(c) acquisition of computer hardware and software for the management
information system, passenger car bogies, turbo chargers, radio
communications equipment to improve utilization of motive power and
rolling stock, simulator for training of locomotive drivers and
miscellaneous maintenance equipment related to the objectives of the
technical assistance activities.
5.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$14.8 million equiva-
lent, with a foreign exchange component of US$13.0 million. A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are given in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Thailand are given in Schedules C and D, respec-
tively. A map is also attached. Given the history of preparation and the
nature of the project, the project was processed on the basis of an expanded
President's Report, which is available in the Project File.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Given the experience of the discon-
tinued Sixth Railway Project, the Bank decided to follow a two-stage approach
to develop a medium and long-term strategy for the railways. During the first
stage, this small project, would demonstrate the impact of operational effi-
ciency improvements on SRT's finances and test Government/SRT commitment to
policy changes. Our expectations for this operation are limited; the objec-
tive is to ascertain the willingness and ability of SRT to institute difficult
but needed changes and the seriousness of the Government's commitment to help
improve the railway's efficiency. At the second stage, a larger loan for SRT
to finance railway investments during the Sixth Plan may be considered depend-
ing on the outcome of the first stage project and the Government/SRT's commit-
ment to further cost cutting measures and tariff reforms as may be necessary.
7.       Our macro-economic dialogue and sector discussions have assisted the
Government and SRT in initiating measures to improve SRT 's finances. In line
with the Government policy of reducing budgetary subsidies to state enter-                g
prises, SRT is drawing up a program to improve efficiency in train operations,
maintenance, and fuel consumption and to increase revenue through enhanced
marketing efforts. Given its past long association with the subsector and its
recent detailed review of the transport sector, the Bank is weli placed to
provide the needed assistance to the Government and SRT in accomplishing these
subsector goals which are primarily efficiency-improvement oriented in scope.
The rationale for Bank involvement with the proposed project, to be completed
within two years, should be seen in this contest. We expect the Government
and SRT to be even more receptive to further policy reforms after some
improvements are already visible.



-3-
8.       AgrEed Actigon.  The Government and SUT have agreed on the following
actions: (a) consultation with the Bank before finalizing SRT's annual
investment programs: (b) annual tariff increases at least to keep pace with
inflation; (c) detailed review of SRT's capital structure and a plan by June
30, 1988, which will enable SRT to finance future capital investments and to
service residual debt liabilities; (d) action plan to revw.ew SRT's entire
tariff structure by December 31, 1988; (e) annual budget provisions and timely
payments to SRT to compensate for losses incurred in maintaining uneconomic
lines and services at the Government's request; and (f) payments, according to
an agreed program, by the Government to cover SRT's 1985 and 1986 losses by
September 30, 1989.
9.       Justification and Risks.  Economic benefits under the proposed
project are expected from: (a) improved efficiencies in railway operations;
and (b) reduction in SRT's losses, initiating the process of making SRT into a
viable state enterprise. Possible risks include delay in appointment of
consultants, thereby delaying the efficiency improvement program. To minimize
this risk, selection of consultants in key areas have already been made.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
