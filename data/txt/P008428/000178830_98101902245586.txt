INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE HELLENIC STATE FOR THE
EAST VERMION (THIRD) IRRIGATION PROJECT
1. *I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Hellenic State for the equivalent of US$40 million, to help finance the
foreign exchange cost of an irrigation project. The loan would have a term
of 15 years including 5-1/2 years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent
per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Greece" (EMA-49a), dated March 22, 1972, was distributed to the Executive
Directors on March 31, 1972. An economic updating mission visited Greece in
January 1975 and its findings are reflected in the following paragraphs.
Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
Recent Developments
3.        Following the Cyprus crisis in July 1974, the seven-year old mili-
tary regime was replaced by an interim civilian Government. In November 1974,
an elected Government, backed by a large parliamentary majority, was estab-
lished. In December 1974, the Greeks voted to establish a republic. A new
constitution, establishing a parliamentary system with a strong presidency,
was approved in June 1975 and the first President elected shortly thereafter
by the required 2/3 majority of Parliament. The Government, besides its con-
cern with the reestablishment of democracy, has focused efforts on foreign
policy issues, especially relations with Turkey and Europe, and on economic
issues, particularly the need to restore and broaden international economic
relations - especially with the EEC to which Greece has applied for full
membership - as well as inflation, a growing balance of payments deficit and
stagnating economic activity.
4.        Throughout the 1960's and up to 1972, the Greek economy enjoyed
rapid GDP growth averaging 7.5 percent per year in real terms. The main
stimulus came from rapidly rising domestic demand, stemming from large in-
creases in private fixed investment - especially in housing - and public in-
frastructure investment. Private consumption rose at a rate of 8 percent
per annum and gross fixed capital formation at 11 percent over this period.
This growth was associated with relatively stable prices. however, by the
end of 1972, as the economy reached full employment, supply constraints began
to develop and domestic prices came under increasing pressure. The inflation-
ary trend was reinforced by the termination of price controls in 1973 and by
increases in import prices, particularly of petroleum (after October 1973),
higher agriculture support prices and increased Government expenditures.



-2-
Consumer prices, which had increased by less than. 3 nercent per annum (on an
annual average basis) in the previous five years, rose 16 percent in 1973 and
27 percent in 1974.  Government measures, including reduced budgetary out-
lays and restrictive monetary policies, reduced the increase in the second
half of 1974 to only 5 percent. However, the developments in the first half
of 1975, indicate that inflation is again accelerating. The restrictive pol-
icies, together with the impact of the Cyprus crisis and resulting domestic
political uncertainties, severely affected economic growth. GDP increased by
about 9 percent in 1973, but declined by about 2 percent in 1974. GNP per
capita in 1974 is estimated at about $1,780 (Atlas basis).
5.        Agriculture and industry are the key economic sectors.    Agriculture
still accounts for about 20 percent of GDP, 40 percent of employment and 35
percent of all exports, besides providing raw materials for the food process-
ing and textile industries. Agricultural production has increased by about
3 percent per annum since 1965, well below overall GDP growth, and reflecting
lower output both in 1968 and 1973, mainly due to unfavorable weather con-
ditions and poor performance in the livestock subsector. However, following
an increase in support prices in October 1973, and with favorable weather,
output increased by a record 13 percent in 1974. Growth in agriculture has
been hampered by insufficient development of irrigation, the small size and
fragmented nature of farm holdings, and inadequate extension services. The
sector is more fully discussed in Part III below.
6.        Industry, including construction, has been the most dynamic sector,
with an average annual growth of nearly 10 percent since 1960. Industrial
value added increased by 13 percent in 1973, but dropped by almost 6 percent
in 1974 due to the general recession in the country. Industry's share of GDP
increased from nearly 26 percent in 1960 to 32 percent in 1973. The share of
manufactured goods in total exports also increased sharply, from 25 percent
in 1968 to an estimated 45 percent in 1974, largely as a result of increased
capacity in the chemical and basic metal industries. Despite rising produc-
tivity, however, Greek industrial growth is still restricted by a small domes-
tic market, limited export orientation, inappropriate plant size and heavy
dependence on capital goods imports. The Government's emphasis on industrial
development as a key to rapid growth is well justified. However, there is a
clear need for Government guidance in determining priorities for future in-
dustrial growth, which can take advantage of a reLatively inexpensive and
moderately skilled labor force, through an emphasis on highly productive ex-
port oriented industries and consumer goods establishments.
Balance of Payments
7.        Recent economic difficulties have been compounded by a deterioration
of the balance of payments in the last two years. The trade deficit stood at
$1.6 billion in 1972. It increased sharply to $2.8 billion in 1973, as im-
ports grewq rapidly - reflecting domestic supply constraints caused by limited
capacity of production. In 1974, the import bill increased only moderate-
ly, as non-oil imports reflected the decline in GDP. The increase in the oil
import bill was $444 million, although re-exports of oil products also rose;
the increase in net petroleum imports was nevertheless $360 million, equivalent



- 3-
to 11 percent of 1973 exports of goods and non-factor services and workers'
remittances. Rapidly rising exports and retarded demand for imported goods,
caused by the general recession, prevented further rise in the trade deficit.
While exports, particularly of manufactured products, have grown by about 25
percent per annum between 1968 and 1974, they still finance only about one-
third of commodity imports. Invisible earnings, mainly from shipping, workers'
remittances and tourism, have usually been equivalent to nearly half of com-
modity imports. In 1974, however, this proportion declined to 35 percent,
reflecting lower tourism receipts - largely because of the Cyprus crisis -
and a decline in workers' remittances due to reduced demand for foreign workers
in Europe.
8.        As a result of these developments, the current account deficit
increased threefold from about $0.4 billion in 1972, to some $1.2 billion in
both 1973 and 1974. Greece has enjoyed a very limited access to long-term
foreign capital, and inflows of concessional funds have been minimal. As a
result, the Government had no recourse but to meet financing needs by medium
and short-term borrowing and suppliers' credits. The terms of borrowing
therefore deteriorated noticeably in 1973 and 1974, reflecting both higher
interest rates and declining grace periods. Foreign exchange reserves were
about $1 billion in 1972 (4-1/2 month of import); however, because of the
increased current account deficit and rising amortization on external debt.
they declined to about $900 million (less than 2-1/2 months of imports) at the
end of 1974.
Prospects
9.        In view of the economic crunch, the Government has postponed the
formulation of a new medium-term development plan for at least one year until
investment priorities can be established and economic policies and strategies
can be reviewed and if necessary, revised. The crucial elements in such a
strategy and plan are, however, already apparent: control over infLation
consonant with policies to stimulate growth, reduction of dependence on agri-
cultural and petroleum imports, promotion of industrial and agricultural
exports, and less housing investment than over the last decade. Tourism and
transport infrastructure, including highways, may be accorded lower priority
than in the past.
10.       The Greek economy is faced with significant problems.    In the short-
term, the Government may experience difficulties in striking the right balance
between measures to restore aggregate purchasing power and regenerate growth
on the one hand, and those to ensure relative price stability and external
balance on the other. Given the immediate priority of stabilization, GDP
growth is at best unlikely to exceed 2 percent in 1975, with the main contri-
butions coming from agricultural output and exports of manufactured goods.
It may not recover to the long-term trend of about 6 to 7 percent even in 1977.
The Government initially aimed at keeping price increases below 10 percent in
1975, but developments in the first half indicate the price rise may end up
between 15-25 percent for the year as a whole. Heavy dependence on imports,



-4-
especially for capital goods, and the vulnerability of earnings from shipping,
tourism and workers' remittances also pose serious short-term problems.   Even
after taking into consideration available undisbursed loan funds, access to
the IMF oil facility, uncommitted funds from EIB, a new EIB financial protocol
being prepared with the EEC, and the recent recourse to the IMF, Greece will
have to borrow a significant amount on world capital markets and will need
to obtain as great a proportion in long-term funding as possible. In 1975
and 1976, the financing gap to be filled by other borrowing is forecast at
$700 million and $950 million respectively, assuming reserves are to be kept
at the equivalent of at least 2 months of imports.,
11.       For the longer term, although Greece's economy is approaching a
more advanced stage of development, like many developing countries it suffers
from significant regional and sectoral disparities. Furthermore, the economy
has to prepare itself to face increasing competition from imports from the
EEC, particularly in the industrial sector, where tariffs and other protective
barriers are being gradually reduced under the Association Agreement. Given
the level of economic development already achieved, a GDP growth rate of about
6 to 7 percent per annum over the longer term seems feasible, provided there
is reasonable weather for agriculture, relative price stability, recovery from
recession in the economies of Greece's major trading partners and availability
of capital from foreign markets of the magnitude needed on a sufficiently long-
term basis. Continuing expansion of manufacturing industry at about 10 percent
per annum in real terms and an increase in agricultural production of 4 to 5
percent per annum will be necessary to achieve the said growth rate. Partici-
pation in the EEC should foster improved management and technological modern-
ization. Greece has important assets in its flexible, market-oriented entre-
preneurial capacity and a comparatively cheap labor force by European stand-
ards. However, full utilization of these resources will require increased
investment in agriculture, in export-oriented industries, and the introduction
of effective vocational, technical and managerial training.
12.       Public external debt outstanding and disbursed at the end of 1974
amounted to $2.0 billion. Debt service payments in 1974 reached $280 million
(of which $8.6 million was on Bank loans), and reoresented 7 percent of re-
ceipts from exports of goods and non-factor services and workers' remittances.
Based on reasonable expectations regarding export growth and future borrowing,
the debt service ratio would increase to about 13-14 percent by 1980. About
3,percent of total service payments would be due to the Bank. In view of the
good prospects for future economic growth, even if at a lower rate, Greece
continues to be creditworthy for Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUT OPERATIONIS IN GREECE
13.       Bank lending to Greece started in 1968, after disputes in connec-
tion with the country's pre-war external debt had been substantially settled.
Greece has received ten loans totalling $233.9 million (net of cancella-
tions), of which $216.6 million was held by the Bank as of June 30, 1975.



5
These include five loans totalling $96.6 to the National Investment Bank for
Industrial Development (NIBID), three loans for education ($82.3 million),
and two loans for irrigation ($55 million). The execution of Bank financed
projects has generally been satisfactory. Annex II contains a summary state-
ment of Bank loans and IFC investments as of June 30, 1975, and notes on the
execution of ongoing projects.
14.       Bank assistance to Greece aims at providing essential infrastructure
in key sectors, including irrigation, transportation and sewerage/wastewater
disposal, reducing regional disparities and incomes through establishment of
new industrial units in less developed areas of Greece and support for selected
regional development programs, and supporting the modernization of institutions
in the sectors financed by the Bank. The Bank is acting as executive agency
for UNDP financed highway reconnaissance and feasibility studies, which are
expected to lead to a highway project, including support for highway mainten-
ance and reorganization later in 1976. A sewerage/wastewater disposal project,
emphasizing institution building and which will also improve living conditions
in towns outside the highly developed Athens area, is under preparation and
is likely to be appraised by the end of the calendar year. Several projects,
including one for the regional development of one of the backward regions of
Greece, are being considered for preparation for lending in subsequent fiscal
years.
15.       Greece is a developing country with a relatively high average per
capita income; but in view of two important considerations, some further
Bank lending is justified. First, the country's external capital requirements
still significantly exceed what it can raise on its own from alternative
market sources on reasonable terms, particularly in face of the medium term
economic difficulties noted above. Second, Greece still faces large pockets
of poverty, regional inbalances and uneven development in several key sectors.
The Government wishes the Bank to play a role in helping reduce those regional
and income disparities and in strengthening sectors, which are critical for
the country's further economic development and for which the Bank is probably
the only present source of external funds. It is, however, anticipated that
within a few years,-Greece will be able to finance its development program
without resort to Bank resources.
16.       IFC has made investments totalling $16.2 million in six Greek com-
panies. An equity and loan investment of $600,000 was made in a fertilizer
factory in 1962 (sold in 1970); and equity investment of $720,000 in NIBID in
1965 (reduced to $102,000 in 1974); loan and equity investments totalling $8.7
million in an aluminum company in 1970 and 1972. In early 1975, IFC invested
$1.15million in an agro-industry project in Larisa for processing of tomatoes,
and at later stages, asparagus and peaches from the area of the Groundwater
Development Project assisted by the Bank (Loan 754-GR).

PART III - AGRICULTURE IN GREECE
General Background
17.       As mentioned in Part I, agriculture is still a dominant force in
Greece's economic life. Over the years, however its share in GNP has declined
to about 20 percent, reflecting a slower growth rate than the other sectors.
Per capita income in this sector is about a thirdl the per capita GNP, and in
certain regions, significantly lower than this. This probably also accounts
for a continuing exodus from the rural areas.
18.       Greece is a mountainous country with about 3.4 million ha of culti-
vated land, of which 1.6 million ha is potential:Ly irrigable. As much as 45
percent of the crop land is found in upland areas, where steep slopes and over
grazing by livestock has led to severe erosion. The soils on the plains are
generally well structured and fertile, but water supply is a limiting factor.
There are 3.0 and 5.3 million ha of forest and range lands respectively, where
livestock graze. The typical Mediterranean long, hot dry summers and short,
cool wet winters are highly favorable for a wide variety of crops, provided
water is made available. Agriculture is relatively well served in terms of
basic infrastructure otherc than irrigation. Over 90 percent of the population
now has electricity supply and on adequate network of feeder roads, some of
which need improving and proper maintenance, connect villages to the main
arteries of communication.
Constraints on Growth
19.       Four main constraints hinder agricultural growth and productivity:
(i) water is scarce and irrigation underdeveloped; the total area under irri-
gation is 0.9 million ha, about half of the potentially irrigable land; (ii)
farm holdings are small and fragmented; (iii) research and extension services,
although efficient, are inadequate; and (iv) unslcilled and underemployed man-
power.
20.       Irrigation is one of the key means for stimulating agricultural
growth, since it enables diversification, helps improve yields, and promotes
the consolidation of fragmented farm holdings.   The Greek authorities have
therefore increased the allocation of investment expenditures for irrigation
projects. However, progress has been slow, due largely to inadequate project
preparation and implementation problems. The proposed project is the third
Bank-financed irrigation project in Greece. The first irrigation loan was made
in June 1971 for the Groundwater Development Project in Thessaly (Loan No.
754-GR). Implementation was originally delayed cdue to lack of experience in
certain aspects of ground water exploitation, but: progress is now satisfactory
although cost increases may force a reduction in project scope. A second loan
was made in June 1974 for the Nestos and Yannitsa Project (Loan No. 911-GR).
The effectiveness of this loan was delayed because of changes in the Greek
political, legal and administrative structure, but the loan was declared ef-
fective in July, 1975.



-7-
21.       Since the rural population is numerous and available land is limited,
the farms are small, ranging from an average in the Ionian Islands of 1.9 ha
to 5.3 ha in Thessaly. The economically active population in agriculture
was 1.3 miillion in the 1971 census, of these, the number farming on their own
farms was 712,000. The situation is aggravated by inheritance laws, which
provide for an equal inheritance by all children in the estate of the parents.
As a result, the farms, besides being small, have become highly fragmented.
At present, it is estimated that the average number of plots of land per farm
is nine and these tend to become dispersed. A long-established program for
consolidating holdings has been intensified in recent years, but so far, only
about one-third of the most badly fragmented land have been consolidated.
22.       Agricultural research, education and extension - of paramount im-
portance if the sector is to modernize - are limited by a shortage of funds
and inadequate number and quality of extension staff. The Bank has assisted
Greece, through the education projects, in updating and expanding the agri-
cultural education system. There are two university schools of agriculture,
12 vocational schools and three new post secondary schools. The extension
service, which comes under the Ministry of Agriculture, is under strength and
has a high turnover. Research institutes and stations exist throughout the
country, operated by the Ministry of Agriculture Research Directorate, but need
additional equipment and staff.
23.       The Agricultural Bank of Greece (ABG), an autonomous public corpora-
tion, is the major source of agricultural finance. It provides the sector with
credit, both in cash and inkind (fertilizers and other supplies). The inter-
est on short-term production loans to farmers, varies from 6-1/4 to 7 percent.
Medium and long-term loans for farm development and purchase of machinery and
livestock, are available at 5-1/2 to 6 percent, while loans for agro-industry
are currently at 9.2 percent. ABG contributed about one-fourth of total
credit made available to the sector in recent years. The outstanding amount
reached Dr. 49.6 billions at the end of 1974, compared with Dr. 18.6 billions
at the end of 1967. Of this, medium and long-term loans outstanding amounted
to Dr. 20.9 billions at the end of 1974, and achieved a growth of more than
20 percent per annum since 1967.
24.       Farm population has also been declining.   It now accounts for only
about 40 percent of the economically active population, compared to about 47
percent in 1966 and 54 percent in 1961. A considerable portion of the decline
has been experienced in the poorer and more remote areas of Greece, and move-
ment away from these areas will probably continue. The 1971 census shows that
about 25 percent of the agricultural working population is illiterate, and
over half of this population has not completed primary school education.
These educational deficiencies could impede technical and commercial improve-
ment in farming.
25.       Under the general pattern of production on Greek farms, the demand
for labor is highly seasonal. It peaks for the harvesting of those crops, such



-8-
as cotton, tobacco and fruit, where intensive manual effort is required, and
at such times it is necessary on many farms to hire casual labor. At other
times of the year there is underemployment.   PermrLanent hired labor accounts
for about 10 percent of the work force in farming.
Agricultural Policy
26.       Agricultural policy in Greece is directed towards influencing the
composition of output and improving production through a complex and extensive
system of minimum support prices and direct income grants, the level of which
are subject to adjustments; in response to market conditions. Incentives were
increased at the end of 1973 to bring them into line with market needs.    The
Government has substantially increased its budget: for agricultural investments
in recent years. In 1974, it amounted to Dr. 4.5 billion, compared with Dr.
1.6 billion in 1967. In 1975, it is expected that public investment expendi-
tures in the agricultural sector should reach Dr. 5.6 billion, about half of
which will go to large-scale irrigation projects.
P'ART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
27.       The proposed project was identified by the Government and prepared
by the Land Reclamation Service (LRS) of the Ministry of Agriculture, assisted
by consultants and the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program. It was originally pro-
posed as part of the Nestos and Yannitsa Irrigation Project (Loan No. 991-GR),
but was not included since it was insufficiently prepared. The project was
appraised in February 1975. Negotiations were held in July 1975 in W4ashington,
with a Greek delegation led by Mr. Petros Papadakis, Director General of the
Ministry of Coordination atnd Planning.
The Project
28.       The proposed project will upgrade and expand irrigation facilities
in the fruit producing area of East Vermion in Central Macedonia, about 70 km
west of Thessaloniki. It will ensure an adequate and stabilized supply of
irrigation water by gravity to about 18.,000 ha of poorly irrigated land devoted
mainly to peach production, and to about 6,000 ha of unirrigated but potential-
ly highly productive land. The water would come from the Aliakrmon and Edessa
Rivers, as well as from springs and deep wells.   Briefly, the proposed project
includes: (a) 15 new main canals with a total length of 140 km- (b) rehabili-
tation and lining of 42 kms of existing main and about 1,500 kms of secondary
and tertiary canals; (c) .r irrigation and 3 drainage pumping stations; (d) 9
small regulating reservoirs and diversion structures; (e) about 14 new wells;
(f) about 1,100 kms of farm roads; (g) abouit 1,100 kms of secondary and terti-
ary drains; (h) about 36 kms of 15 to 20 kv of power transmission lines (i)
minor levelling on 4,800 ha, of land; (j) provision of equipment, extension



-9-
and research services; (k) training; and (1) consultants services for the
project and identification and preparation of an identified project in the
Xanthi-Komotini area. The details are provided in a Loan and Project Summary
attached as Annex III. A report entitled "Appraisal of The East.Vermion
Irrigation Project, Greece" (No. 836-GR, dated August 7, 1975) is being dis-
tributed separately.
29.       Water currently available from the Edessa River (averaging 5.0 m3/
sec) will be reduced to about 2.5 m3/sec in the future, by additional diver-
sions for power generation.. The Project would offset this loss and provide
additional water for the area by developing new Rump wells and diversions from
the Aliakmon River providing 5.5 Mm3 and 54.5 MmJ respectively. The remainder
of the gross requirement (103 Mm3) would be supplied from existing project
sources. Reliability of the Aliakmon supply is assured by the existing 1,300
Mm3 Polyphytos storage reservoir on the river, just above the project diver-
sion. All sources of water are of high quality, and an assurance has been
obtained that the Borrower would maintain a satisfactory quality of the irri-
gation water supplying the Project Area through regular monitoring and analysis
and by requiring corrective action by industries if their effluents reduce
water quality to unsatisfactory levels. Although, there are no known plans
for further. power or industrial development which could interfere with the
project supply, agreement has also been reached on a guaranteed 15.5 Mm3 per
second minimum flow rate during the peak demand period for the project. In
the event of a planned reallocation of water extracted from the Aliakmon and
Edessa Rivers affecting the Project supply of irrigation water, the Government
would inform the Bank before such reallocation is made and provide for an
alternative supply. In deciding whether to replace or modify Project facili-
ties for this purpose, the Government will determine the solution with the
lowest economic cost and cover any cost increases.
Project Costs and Cost Recovery
30.       The total project cost is estimated at approximately $90 million,
including about $7 million for interest and other charges during construction.
The proposed Bank loan of $40 million would finance all foreign exchange costs
of the project, including $6.0 million of interest and other charges during
construction. The balance of project costs, about $50 million, will be fi-
nanced by the Government through budget allocations to LRS and the Public
Power Corporation (PPC).
31.       Under the project, the full operation and maintenance costs of the
irrigation and drainage works, including the cost of power, and a reasonable
portion of the initial investment costs would be recovered from project
beneficiaries. Commencing with the second year of supply of water from the
project, farmers will pay an annual depreciation charge which will be adjusted
annually in proportion to changes in the operation and maintenance charges.
It is expected that the depreciation charge will be about $40/ha in current
prices by the time of its introduction, when the operating and maintenance



- 10 -
costs are expected to be about $64/ha. About 32 percent of investment costs
will be recovered over 40 years discounted at 10 percent. The total charge
(O&M plus depreciation) of $104/ha is about 10 percent of incremental farm
income, but is considered reasonable because the project farmers are relative-
ly poor with an average income about a third the GNP per capita of $1,780.
Organization and Management
32.       Project implementation would be the responsibility of LRS, an agency
of the Ministry of Agriculture established in 1958 to undertake groundwater
exploitation as well as rehabilitation and construction of irrigation and
drainage systems, on-farm development and farm roads throughout Greece. PPC
would construct and maintain the electrical facilities for supplying power
to the irrigation and drainage pumps. A senior officer of the LRS in Athens,
would be appointed as project manager, although most of the operations would
be carried out through LRS's regional office in Thessoloniki and its field
offices within the project area. The project manager would be responsible
for coordinating operations with other agencies and for the procurement of
goods and services for the project.   His appointment would be a condition of
effectiveness. Consultants, currently employed on the project, would be
retained to complete detailed designs and tender documents and assist in bid
evaluation. Additional consultants would be employed for the Xanthi-Komotini
regional studies and designs. In all, about 375 man-months of consultants'
services would be required.
33.       Overall coordination would be provided by a Steering Committee,
either that formed for the Nestos and Yannitsa Project, or a similar one,
which would be chaired by a Director-General of the Ministry of Coordination
and Planning. The committee would include representatives of that Ministry,
of Public Works and Agriculture, LRS, the PPC and the ABG. The Steering
Committee would ensure consistency in project works, coordinate act-ivities
among the different agencies, review project programs and provide policy
guidance. The establishment of a new committee for the project or the
extension of authority of the Nestos and Yanitsa Committee to the project,
would be a condition of effectiveness. The project manager would act as a
secretary to the Committee. The Committee would meet at least twice a year
and keep the Bank informedl of its deliberations.
34.       The project works would be maintained and administered by three
successfully functioning local farmers associations (TOEVs) in the Project
Area, with technical assistance from LRS. Pumping plant maintenance would
be the responsibility of the regional association of water users (GOE's),
which would also coordinate water supplies and relations between the TOEVs
and operate and maintain the main supply canal. The PPC will operate and
miaintain project electrical networks.
35.       The proposed loan does not include any agricultural credit, since
adequate credit is being provided by the three branches of the Agricultural



- 11 -
Bank of Greece (ABG) which serve the project area and the incremental credit
requirements are small. Under the terms of the Loan Agreement, the Government
will ensure that ABG will continue to provide such credit to the project area;
that extension services would continue to be provided in the project area by
the Inspectorate of Agriculture in Thessaloniki, whose staff would be increased
and equipped to ensure efficient service; and that research programs of exist-
ing stations in the area, would be expanded and geared to meet project needs.
Procurement and Disbursement
36.       Three prime contracts, including civil works and project equipment,
totalling about US$50.3 million, and supply contracts totalling about US$0.5
million for O&M and extension equipment exceeding US$25,000 in value, would
be awarded through international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's Procurement Guidelines. Local manufacturers would be allowed a 15%
preference margin or the applicable customs duty, whichever is less. Con-
tracts for items of material and equipment, costing less than US$25,000 but
limited to an aggregate of US$300,000, would be procured locally, following
regular government procedures. Land levelling would be performed by LRS,
through force account and contracts. The electrical network would be con-
structed by PPC, also through local contracts and force account as part of its
overall development program. Both these organizations are adequately staffed
and equipped to undertake or supervise the work.
37.       The Bank loan would finance:   (i) 46 percent of the cost of civil
works contracts; (ii) 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of imported
equipment and materials and 90 percent of the ex-factory costs of locally
supplied equipment, (iii) all foreign exchange costs of consultant services
and training, and (iv) interest and other charges on the loan accrued on or
before July 31, 1980.
Project Benefits and Economic Return
38.       The project will increase and stabilize yields of present crops
and substantially improve the quality of fruit production, mainly peaches.
With the project, it is estimated that peach production would increase by
about 68,000 tons or about 46 percent. Other deciduous fruit production,
mainly apples, pears and cherries, would increase by 30,000 tons. Vegetable
production is expected to increase by 14,000 tons, alfalfa by 17,000 tons,
and cotton and legumes by small amounts. Peaches are already well established,
and about a quarter of the incremental production would come from young trees
now beginning to bear. Peaches have been exported in increasing quantity
since 1962 and there are elaborate sorting, packing, storage, transportation
and market intelligence systems supporting their export to Western Europe.
In 1974, about 100,000 tons were exported. Although the marketing outlook
for mid-season table varieties is uncertain, there is considerable room for
exports of the more profitable early and late varieties, which the project
will permit to be more widely grown.    Moreover, there is considerable demand
for industrial varieties suitable for canning. The other fruits and crops
have a ready domestic market.

39.       The quantifiable benefits of the project would include increased
output, foreign exchange earnings and employment. At full development in
1987, the projected net value of incremental production, at 1975 prices, would
be about $17 million. The average annual net income for a typical farm
family (averaging 4.5 persons) operating a farm of 2 ha, with orchards, is
estimated to be about $4,900, as compared to the present income of $2,800.
A similar average farm family with a smaller irrigated farm (1 ha) cultivating
mainly annual crops would have an annual income of about $1,900, compared to
the present income of about $1,200. These represent increases of 72 percent
and 58 percent, respectively, for nearly 14,000 families whose current per
capita incomes are less than one third the national average.   The project
would also provide increased employment opportunities for these families,
which are presently underemployed, besides increasing the need for hired
labor by 64 percent or 3,200 man-years, each year. The economic rate of
return, costing labor at market wages, is estimat:ed at 18.5 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUI4ENTS AND AUMORITY
40.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Hellenic Republic and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft: resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Execut:ive Directors separately.
The draft agreement conforms generally to the normal pattern for loans for
irrigation projects.
41.       Special conditions of loan effectiveness are:   (a) that the project
manager referred to in paragraph 32 above has been appointed and has taken up
his post (Loan Agreement Section 5.01(a)); and (b) that the Steering Committee
referred to in paragraph 33 above has assumed its functions (Loan Agreement
Section 5.01(b)).
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMNDATION
43.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Loan No. 711 - First Education Project; $13.8 million Loan of November 5, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
Civil works for construction of the project schools are proceeding
satisfactorily and most of the schools should be completed by March 1976.
Bids for furniture and equipment have been called twice, as the first tenders
involved complex procedures which discouraged bi'dders. The second set of bids
has been evaluated and contracts are being awarded. Despite these delays,
the project is expected to be completed within about nine months of the ori-
ginal schedule.
Loan No. 859 - Second Education Project: $23.5 million Loan of October 2, 1972;
Closing Date: July 31, 1977.
Consultant architects for all thirty-three schools to be built under
the project, have been appointed and space standards set; preliminary designs
are underway. Bids on the first group of equipment and furniture contracts
for project schools are being evaluated. The Education Project Unit is per-
forming satisfactorily. The Government requested the deletion from the proj-
ect, of the extensions to the University of Patras (representing 43 percent
of total costs) and the reallocation of the savings to other project compo-
nents which have experienced considerable cost increases. The request was
approved by the Executive Directors on July 25, 1975.
Loan No. 754 - Groundwater Development Project (Irrigation): US$25 million
Loan of June 21, 1971. Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Implementation of this project began slowly due to delays in con-
tract awards, changes in designation of project areas prompted by the ongoing
consultants' study, and a protracted search for a satisfactory solution
(found in December 1973) to the question of farmers' contributions to the
capital cost of the project. Studies are now being made to find the most
efficient design of tertiary systems. Drilling operations are now proceed-
ing at a satisfactory rate, and the project is expected to be completed by
June 1978, about two years behind schedule.
Loan No. 991 - Nestos and Yannitsa Irrigation Project: $30.0 million loan of
June 3, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Because of recent political changes in Greece, there were delays in
completing the conditions of effectiveness. The Loan was made effective on
July 29, 1975. The review of the tertiary canal design standards has been com-
pleted, and project implementation is now beginning.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

bursed as of June 30, 1975. Project implementation has been satisfactory.
Loan No. 945 - Fourth NIBID Project: $15.0 million loan of November 29, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The fourth loan has been almost fully committed, and only $3.2 mil-
lion remained to be disbursed as of June 30, 1975. Project implementation

Procurement:        Civil works and equipment contracts exceeding US$25,000 in
value would be awarded through international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Local manufac-
turers would be allowed a 15% preference margin or the
applicable customs duty, whichever is less. Procurement
of material and equipment costing less than US$25,000
could be purchased locally following regular government
procedures, but limited to an aggregate of US$300,000.
Land leveling would be performed by LRS through force
account and local contracts. The electrical network
would be constructed by the PPC, also through local
contracts and force account as part of its overall devel-
opment program.
Consultants:        Three consortia of Greek firms, lead respectively by
Pandis and Cofas, Komis and Haitides, and Karadimos are
already engaged for the designing of the project and
are proposed to be continued for the 125 man-months total
of consultancy services financed under the proposed proj-
ect for completing the designs and tender documents. In
addition, consultants will be hired to carry out the
identification and preparation of an irrigation project
in the Xanthi-Komotini area which will require about
250 man-months.
