This is the Project Completion leport for the last Venion Irrigation
Project for which a loan of US$40.0 mi1l'ion was approved on February 9, 1975.
Due to the slow pace of project implmntation, no disbursements took place
until June 1978. Loan Closing Date was etende  three tims; and the loan
fially closed on June 30, 1984.  Of the U$40.0 million loan, only  S$2S.9
million (65S) was disbursed, while the remaining US$14.1 mdllion was cancelled
on two occasions, US$8.7 million on July 26, 1984, and the remai_ing US$5.39
million on November 16, 1984. Final disbursement under this Loan wasmade on
November 6, 1984.
This Project Completion Report (PCR), dated March 17, 1986, ha  boe
prepared by the Agricultural I Division of the Burope Middle Last and Northern
Africa Region, based on a Draft Project Completion Report submitted by the
Borrower, Ministry of Agriculture, Belleic Republic. Its preparation has
also been based on additional information provided by the Borrower, and on
review of the Appraisal Report (No. 836-GB) dated May 7, 1975, the PrQsidaunt's
Report (No. 1684-Ga) dated August 7. 1975, and the Loas Agreement dated
October 3, 1975. Correspondence with the Borrower and internal msmranda and
documents on the project contained In Bank's files have also been consulted
during preparation of the PCI.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluatioi
Departm4nt.
The draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments on April 15,
1986. However, none were received.
The assistance provided by the Borrower for the preparation of this
report is gratefully acknowledged.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
East Vermion Irrigation Project
Loan 1165-GRE
Evaluation Sumr'
Introduction
The East Vermion Irrigation Project (total estimated cost at
appraisal US$89.8 million; Loan amount US$40.0 million) was the third
irrigation project to be financed by the Bank in Greece. Although public
investment directed to the agricultural sector in the 1960's had largely been
concentrated on irrigation projects, their implementation, spread over a large
number of projects, suffered from inadequate project preparation and
institutional coordination, both leading to long gestation periods.  In an
attempt to rectify this situation during the late 60's and early 70's, the
Government and the Bank reviewed a number of investment alternatives in the
sector. As a result of %.hese reviews and of further studies, the first
irrigation project, Groundwater Development Project (located in the Thessalay
Plain) was approved by the Bank in June 1971, and the Nestos and Yanitsa
Irrigation Project (located in the Saloniki Plain) approved in April 1974. In
addition, a Bank Economic Mission, fielded in January 1975, stressed the
importance of the agricultural sector in the national economy an4 recommended
increased investments in irrigation for rapid agricultural development. It
was in support of those Bank and Government objectives that the Bank agreed to
assist in financing the East Vermion Irrigation Project.
Objetives
Project was expected to raise agricultural production of high-value
crops for export and local consumption, expand rural employment opoortunities
and increase rural incomes in the East Vermion area. These objectives were
expected to be achieved by assisting the Government in rehabilitating and
upgrading existing irrigation facilities to assure an adequate and stable
supply of irrigation water to about 18,000 ha, mostly of peach-producing land,
and for new irrigation facilities for about 6,000 ha, of rainfed agricultural
land.
The project, as appraised, comprised: (a) construction of 15 new
concrete-lined primary irrigation canals; (b) rehabilitation of 42 km of
irrigation canals and 2,550 km of secondary and tertiary irrigation canals;
(c) establishment of nine small regulating reservoirs, a small diversion
structure, five irrigation pumping stations and three drainage pumping
stations; (d) construction of 14 new deep wells equipped with electric pumps;
(e) installation of 36 km of 15-20 KV power transmission lines to serve
pumping stations and pump units; (f) construction of 1,110 km of farm access
roads and minor land leveling; (g) provision of operation and maintenance
equipment; (h) provision of technical assistance, additional extension and
research staff and training abroad for agricultural research personnel; and
(i) feasibility study and preparation for an irrigation project in the
Xanthi-Komotini areas.

Implementation Experience
Project implementation was initially delayed, due to the time
required by the implementing agency for preparing final designs and tender
documents for the three subproject areas (para. 3.01).  Implementation was
further delayed by changes in project design (para. 3.18), procurement
problems (paras. 3.03, 3.04 and 3.06), management and financial difficulties
faced by contractors (paras. 3.05, 3.07, 3.10 and 6.03), and land acquisition
problems (para. 6.02). In addition, the implementing agencies lacked an
effective management information system (para. 6.04), which could have helped
to identify project related problems at the early stages of project
implementation.
Results
The works on the Tripotamos-Verian sub-area, which were 95% completed
at the time of the closure of the Loan, were firally completed in December
1984 (para. 3.05). Works on the Edessa Pella sub-area were fully completed
during 1985 (para. 3.07). However, works on the Arapitsa sub-area had to be
retendered in August 1984, and are not expected to be completed before
June 1986 (para. 3.10).
Findings and Lesns
The main lessons learned from this project are twofold--one, the need
for a more thorough evaluation of alternatives in project design and two,
importance of involving the project beneficiaries more actively in the
preparation; and possibly arriving at a compromise solution in project design
prior to appraisal, especially since some of the project works had to be
constructed through orchards, with which the farmers were reluctant to part.
Other lessons learned are:
(a)    Procurement procedures required streamlining to assure a more
active participation of foreign bidders. Also, financial and
management capabilities of bidders should be given proper weight
in the bid evaluation process;
(b)    Progress reporting should show project expenditures in relation
to physical works more clearly, and identify bottlenecks
encountered, solutions proposed and recommended action to be
subsequently followed up;
(c)    Monitoring and evaluation of agricultural production needs to be
more comprehensive for decision-making and post project
evaluation; and
(d)    Bank supervision missions, given their frequent visits, should
have paid more attention to assess local capability in planning,
design and construction of irrigation works in difficult terrain
conditions.



The project is expected to be completed by December 1986. However,
despite delays in implementation and changes in design, the project is
achieving cropping patterns.and yields estimated at appraisal. Expansion in
peach orchards and increase in early peach production has exceeded appraisal
estimates (paras. 4.01-4.03). Hence, economic rate of return is currently
estimated at 15.5%.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Agriculture in the Economy.  Agriculture plays an important role in
the Greek economy. It employs about 302 of the active working population,
generates 182 of GDP, contributes substantially to export earnings and
supplies industrial raw materials (Annex 1, Tables 1 and 2). Of the 3.9
million ha of productive land, about 3.4 million ha are cultivated, the
remainder being fallow land. Farms are small and scattered, and farmers lack
the resources to develop and intensify production. The fragmentation of land
coutinues to be a major structural problem in agriculture. About 232 of the
landholdings are under 1 ha, and about 95% of the holdings under 10 ha. This
pattern has not changed since 1961 (Annex 1, Table 3).
1.02      The majority of public investments made in agriculture in the last
15 years have been for land reclamation works. Public investments represent
about 30% of the total investments in agriculture, the remainder beisig private
investment.
1.03      Bank Involvement in Agriculture and the Irrigation Subsector.  The
East Vermion Irrigation Project was the third project financed by the World
Bank Group in this subsector. The first loan of US$25 million was made in
June 1971 for the Groundwater Development Project (Loan 754-GR). This project
was the first large-scale public tubewell program in Greece and was part of
the Government's program for utilization of the groundwater resource of the
Thessaly Plain to irrigate 40,000 ha of cultivable land. Project
implementation was considerably delayed primarily due to the lack of
experience of the Land Reclamation Service, which was not fully equipped to
deal with a project of such a magnitude and complexity. The studies on
network design and operation were inadequate, and the performance of some of
the well-drilling contractors was poor. The loan was closed in May 1982, four
years later than originally planned, when the revised construction program was
only partially co.opleted. Despite the large cost overruns and project
implementation delays, the change from dry farming to irrigated farming has
brought to the Thesoaly region high yields and high-value crops generating
higher farm incomes. A Project Completion Report was prepared by the Greek
Ministry of Agriculture and its overview was prepared in June 1983 by EMENA
Agriculture I Projects Division. This was followed by a project performance
audit report prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department and was issued
as a report (No. 5093) on May 24, 1984.

1.04      The Groundwater Development Project was followed by the Nestos and
Yaumitsa Irrigation Project, which the Bank assisted with a US$30.0 million
loan in June 1974. The loan was fully disbursed in July 1983. This project
also encoustered substantial implementation delays due to: (i) shift in the
execut've responsibility of the preparation of the final designs of the
modified irrigation system to a relatively inexperienced team of consultants,
(ii) changes in contractual arrangements together with cumbersome procedures
for the review and approval of documents, and (iii) lack of a clear definition
of the project's design system at the feasibility stage which caused
substantial initial delays and necessitated changes in project scope. A
Project Completion Report of the Yannitsa Irrigation Project was prepared by
the staff of the Ministries of Public Works and Agriculture in March 1984.
This was supplemented with a PCR overview by EMENA Agriculture I Division and
was issued on March 18, 1985 (Report No. 5542). The project was not selected
for audit by the Operations Evaluation Department.
II. PROJECT PROCESSING
2.01      Project Identification.  The East Vermion Irrigation Project was
identified by the Government of Greece and was prepared by the Land
Reclamation Service (LRS) of the Ministry of Agriculture who were assisted by
consultants and the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program. The project originally
consisted of two segments, the East Vermion and Xanthi-Komotini. Following a
review of their preparation reports, an appraisal mission was mounted in
February 1975. The mission concluded that the Xanthi-Komotini segment was not
adequately prepared and that it required additional two years of study.
Therefore, in view of the amount of the Bank loan being limited, and the
Government s own financial resources being constrained, it was agreed that the
project would consist of the East Vermion alone, but would provide funds for
the completion of studies of the Xanthi-Komotini segmelt.
2.02      Project Objectives and Description.  The main objectives of the
project were to raise agricultural production of high-value crops for export
and local consumpt4on, expand rural employment opportunities and increase
ru-'l incomes. The project assisted in rehabilitation and upgrading of
existing irrigation facilities to assure an adequate and stable supply of
irrigation water to about 18,000 ha of mostly peach-producing land and for new
irrigation facilities for about 6,000 ha of rainfed agricultural land.
2.03      A World Bank Economic Mission fielded in January 1975 stressed the
importance of the agricultural sector in the national economy and recommended
increased investment in irrigation for rapid agricultural development. The
mission further emphasized rehabilitation and completion of existing projects
followed by improvements in preparation of new projects. The project
rationale was, therefore, in line with Bank strategy which stressed the need
to increase agricultural productivity and raise rural incomes.
2.04      Project Components.  The main components of the project were:
(a)  Constructio:. of 15 new concrete-lined primary irrigation canals o.
140 km.



-3-
(b) Rehabilitation of 42 km of irrigation canals and 2,550 km of
secondary and tertiary irrigation canals.
(c) Establishment of nine small regulating reservo.rs, small diversion
structure, five irrigation pumping stations and three drainage
pumping stations.
(d) Construction of 14 new deep wells equipped with electric pumps.
(e) Installation of 36 km of 15-20 KV power transmission lines to serve
pumping stations and pump units.
(f) Construction of 1,110 km of farm access roads and minor land
levelling of 4,800 ha.
(g) Supply of equipment required for the operation and maintenance of
project facilities and for extension services in project area.
(h) Provision of technical assistance, additional extension and research
staff and training abroad for agricultural research personnel in LRS.
(i) Feasibility study and preparation for an irrigation project in the
Xanthi-Komotini areas.
2.Os      Project Area.  The project area slopes downward to the east and
south from an elevation of about 450 m in the mountain section of Edessa to
19 m in the south of Tripotamos. The land has a relatively flat and even
terrain with slopes ranging from 0.2% to 0.61, and also consists of
semi-mountainous country in the Vermion foothills mainly within Edessa and
Arapitsa. This upland region is dissected by mountain streams and has an
uneven relief with irregular slopes averaging about ,% increasing locally to
15% and in certain portions increasing to 302.
2.06      Negotiations.  The main issue raised during negotiations by the
Greek delegation related to cost recovery under the project. The Bank's
original proposal called for the cost recovery to be a percentage of the O&M
costs. However, since it was estimated that the O&M costs of the proposed
project would be lower than in previous projects, a higher percentage (57% vs.
27X) was suggested in order to maintain the same absolute level of total
charges of about US$100 per ha per year. Since the percentage rule could
caust difficulty in getting it through the Greek Parliament, it was eventually
agreed that the farmers would pay an annual depreciation charge equal to an
agreed base amount of Uj$17 per ha for 1975 and adjusted annually in
proportion to changes in O&M costs. These charges would begin in the second
year in which they receive water from the project. This system would yield au
average initial recovery charge of about US$40 per ha in 1975 US$ to cover O&M
and a total charge of about US$100 per ha to recover a portion of the
investment costs.
2.05      The loan was aptroved on February 9, 1975, sigred on October 3,
1975, and became effective on August 12, 1976. The project effectiveness date
had to be extended three times from the original date of January 5, 1976, due



- 4 -
to the necessity of obtaining ratification by Greek Parliament, which was a
time-consuming procedure. Parliament ratification was a continuing problem
with all former Bank loans.  Further, there were delays in the appointments of
a Project Manager and a Steering Committee, which were conditions of
effectiveness. This resulted in project implementation delays and associated
cost increases.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      Project Start-up.  The loan agreement was signed on October 3, 1975
but became effective only on August 12, 1976. Following its effectiveness,
the implementation agency, the Land Reclamation Service of the Ministry of
Agriculture with the assistance of consultants spent a great deal of time in
the preparation of designs and tender documents for the three subproject
areas, which comprised the project.
Subproiect Areas
3.02      The implementation of each of the subproject areas and problems
encountered are analyzed individually in the following paragraphs.
Tripotamos-Veria Subproject Area.
3.03      The first contract consisted of the construction of one main pumping
station, two small pumping stations, equalizing reservoirs, primary and
secondary canals, roads and supply and installation of pumps and electrical
motor equipment. These would serve about 9,885 ha in the Tripotamos-Veria
subproject area. It was originally planned to commence in March 1977 with an
expected completion date of December 31, 1980. Bids for the contract were
received from 13 Greek firms in December 1976. The lowest evaluated bidder
for the construction was 47% below the estimated base cost of the works.
Because of the design changes made in 1977 (para. 3.17) due to difficult
topographic conditions, the implementation agency, Land Reclamation Service,
decided to retender bids and limited the discount to no more than 301 which
could be offered by any firm, and this was agreed to by the Bank. This caused
a delay in the very start-up of the project.
3.04      The revised tendering met withi unforeseen problems leading to
further delays. Greek contractors were boycotting to protest against a
revised law on contracting in August 1977. Resulting from these
circumstances, one Greek firm submitted the bid on time"" for Dr 420 million
(US$11.7 million) or 45% under the estimated cost of the contract. Despite
the original agreement between the Bank and LRS to disregard bids which were
offering more than 30% discount, the contract was awarded in January 1978 to
the firm which is one of the largest Greek contractors at a 451 discount. The
completion date was revised to August 1982. The period of 54 months appeared
1/ Revised tender documents were reissued in June 1977 to all 46 contractors
(including 6 foreign firms) which prequalified with a bid opening date of
August 29, 1977 for the first contract.



-5-
to be a reasonable estimate to allow for delays in land acquisition, problems
associated with severe winter conditions and keeping the canals flowing during
the irrigation season. In October 1979, the land acquisition issues were
settled in this area after a protracted period of over three years.
3.05      Contractor Performance:  The performance of the contractor was very
poor due to inefficient management. The contractor also faced difficulties in
land access and bad weather conditions. It resulted in the cancellation of
the contract in October 1979 after Veria reservoir was completed. Only 3% of
the work on the canal system was carried out. Following another tendering
process, the Government in consultation with the Bank awarded a new contract
to a Greek firm, who offered to perform the works at 34% below the estimated
cost. Most of the project construction, though considerably delayed, was
eventually completed in December 1984.
Edessa-Pella Subproject Area:
3.06      The second contract consisted of the construction of three
regulating reservoirs, irrigation wells, primary and secondary canals,
drainage network and farm roads serving 7,028 ha in the Edessa-Pella
subproject area. This contract was estimated to commence in July 1977 and
completed by December 1980. Unlike the first contract for which the bids were
offered at a discount, the bids for the second contract were excessive. For
this contract, 34 firms, including 29 Greek and 4 foreign firms, were
prequalified, but only 4 of the Greek firms submitted bids on time in February
1978. The Government rejected all the bids and requested retendering because
of the excessively high prices. Finally, the contract was awarded in July
1978 with a revised completion date of June 1983.
3.07      Contractor Performance.  The performance of the contractor was
poor. After 20 months, the contractor ran into financial difficulties having
completed only 20% of the work. He chose to forfeit his contract in March
1980 under the provisions of a new Greek law. Following the default of the
contractor, the Edessa contract was divided into two segments. Thi lower
segment, where no work had been initiated by the previous contractor, was
awarded to a new Greek contractor in June 1981 and he was given 30 months to
complete. In the upper segment, where work had been carried out by the
previous contractor, a new co#ntract was awarded to a Greek firm in March 1982
and the firm was given 12 nonths to complete.
3.08      Other Problems.  In addition to contractor-related problems, this
area also faced very difficult construction problems. The area consisted of
steep rocky terrain, very i>arr(w working corridors between plantations, and
unexpected foundation conditions. Moreover, there were objections and
complaints raised by landowners regarding land access and crop damage on
rights-of-way already expropriated for the construction of project
structures. The construction-related problems were overcome by providing
extra compensation for increased work due to difficult terrain not included in
the tender documents; such concessions avoided further contractor failures and
associated delays. Problems relating to land acquisition were remedied with
the assistance of the local Farmers' Water Users Association (TOEV), who
reduced the landowner's resistance to construction access and damage claims.



-6-
Assistance was also sought from officials of the responsible ministries who
explained to the landowners that continued objections and interference in
construction only increased costs and caused delays in reaping the benefits
frow an assured water supply.
Arapitsa-Noussa Subproject Area:
3.09      The third contract consisted of the construction of five equalizing
reservoirs, primary and secondary canals, drainage network, two pumping
stations and farm roads. These would serve about 7,087 ha in the
Arapitsa-Noussa subproject area. Contract III was estimated to commence in
May 1977 with an expected completion date of December 1980. The contract was
awarded in August 1979.
3.10      Contractor Performance.  The performance of the contractor for this
contract also was poor. The contractor experienced management and financial
problems in early 1981. However, since June 1983, when the contractor
complied with a reorganization and management and had financial backing, and
the threat of possible legal action against him by Land Reclamation Service
(LRS), the contractor was retained in the hope that construction momentuz
would pick up. However, even after the reorganization of the company under a
new ownership in June 1983, and the granting of a contract extension until
December 1985, the contractor could not keep the revised implementation
schedule. Finally, in March 1984, after only 352 of the work had been
completed, the Government terminated the contract and retendered the remaining
65% of the work. Two new contracts were signed in August 1984 and all the
work is expected to be completed by May-June 1986.
Project Review
3.11      The project was being given a rating of "2", having "moderate
problems" during 14 of the 16 supervision missions. In retrospect, such
assessments might have underestimated the management and financial problems
the various contractors were facing during project implementation. The
project was discussed in the overall context of the joint project reviews
between the Bank and the Greek Government in 1979 and 1980. The reviews
contributed to the solution of the land acquisition problem and brought about
closer supervision by LRS. Despite this, however, the project continued to
suffer from contractual delays, which could be attributed to the contractors'
having the freedom to opt out of their contract in accordance with Greek laws,
inadequate counterpart funds, farmers' resistance in some areas, and difficult
terrain.
Xanthi-Komotini Study.
3.12      This study was a small component of the project.  The terms of
reference for this study were prepared by FAO/CP and consisted of four phases:
(a)  Water Resources Inventory
(b)  Master Plan Studies
(c)  Irrigation Feasibility Studies
(d)  Irrigation Final Design
Also included in the study was the identification of a rural development
component with a fishery development subproject in Lake Vistoris (identified
by the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program in 1976) and construction of social



-7-
infrastructure (schools, village water supply, rural roads, health centers).
However, in April 1976, the Government requested the Bank to delete this
component due to problems of riparian rights with Bulgaria over the use of
Nestos River and the possibility of finding oil in the region. Government
requested, and the Bank agreed, that a portion of the funds (US$0.3 million)
be allocated to the study of the Fruits and Vegetables Project, and the
remaining US$1.5 million was cancelled. The study led to the preparation and
financing of a Marketing Project.
Quality of Performance of Project Structures
3.13      The quality of the construction of project works is adequate.  The
completed facilities continue to operate satisfactorily. While some of the
construction was below expectations, civil works, in general, appear to be
acceptable as regards structural safety.
Project Costs
3.14      ApRraisal Estimate.  The tot l project cost estimated at appraisal
was US$89.9 million including physical and price contingencies and interest
during construction. The foreign exchange component was estimated at US$40.8
million (45%) which included the direct cost of foreign purchases of equipment
and materials, foreign consultants and training, indirect cost of imported
items and materials used in the local manufacturing or assembly of project
equipment.
3.15      Revised Cost Estimates.  The project costs were revised in December
1976 to take into consideration the devaluation of the Drachma, the revised
1976 price escalators of the Bank and the allocation of US$0.3 million for the
preparation of the study for a Fruit and Vegetable Project. The revised
project cost was estimated at US$82.6 million (Dr. 3,015.2 million), about 8%
lower than that estimated at appraisal. This resulted mainly from a 227
depreciation of the Drachma in relation to the US Dollar between December 1976
and the time of appraisal"'. Annex 2, Table 1 shows the actual project
costs for the various components compared with appraisal estimates. By
project completion in 1987, the actual project costs are estimated to be Dr.
10,850.0 million representing a cost overrun of Dr. 7,835.0 million (260%)
over the revised project cost estimate and US$104.6 million with a cost
overrun of US$22.0 million (271) in dollar terms (Annex 3, Table 3). The
difference between the two is mainly accounted for by the devaluation in
drachmas and the high inflation rate during project implementation period.
3.16      Cost Overrun.  Analysis of cost changes from appraisal estimates has
been provided in Annex 2, Table 2. The bulk of the cost increase has occurred
in civil works, to a tune of 3442 (using revised cost estimate as the basis)
in drachma terms. This is due largely to the rise in domestic inflation,
increase in physical works necessitated by changes in project design, land
acquisition problems and delays resulting in escalation in land prices, and
inordinate construction delays caused by defaulting contractors.
1/ The rate of exchange at appraisal (August 1975) was US$1 = 29.9 Dr and
in September 1976 was US$1 = 36.5 Dr.



-8-
3.17      Cost Per Hectare.  Analysis of the investment costs per hectare,
which consisted mostly of rehabilitation works, indicates that the appraisal
mission in 1975 estimated it at US$3,742 per irrigable hectare. The actual
costs in constant 1985 US dollars are estimated at US$5,218 per irrigable
hectare.
3.18      Design Changes.  The project design had to be changed in April 1977
due to the drastic increase in the price of land. Cost of land acquisition
had increased from about Dr 200,000 (US$5,560) per ha at appraisal in 1975 to
about Dr. 1,100,000 (US$27,800) per ha in 1977, especially in areas where they
were occupied by tree crops. The original project design would have
necessitated acquiring about 900 ha of private land in the project area which,
with the high land cost, would have caused a 302 increase in the project
cost. Therefore, design changes had to be made in the project to reduce the
private land occupied by project structures by 80% to 200 ha. This new design
increased the total length of the canal system, but the extra cost of
lengthening the canal network was offset by saving on the cost of land
acquired.
Disbursements
3.19      Actual pace of disbursements fell far short of appraisal
expectations. A comparison of the actual disbursements versus appraisal
estimaces is presented in Annex 2, Table 4. No disbursements took place until
June 1978, compared with the appraisal estimate of 482 of the loan. This was
a result of the slow pace of project execution and an overoptimistic appraisal
estimate. Until June 1981, six years following appraisal, disbursements were
only 12% of appraisal estimate, which were mostly to cover interest and other
charges during construction. With the pickup of project construction and
resolution of problems of land expropriation and contractors, disbuzsements
gradually increased through December 1984. Of the US$40.0 million loan, only
US$25.9 millicn (651) was disbursed while the remaining US$14.1 million (351)
was cancelled on two occasions, one for US$8.77 million on July 26, 1984 and
the other for US$5.39 million on November 16, 1984. It took ten years for
actual disbursements to be completed compared to five years at appraisal.
3.20      A comparison of actual disbursements versus appraisal by categories
is provided in Annex 2, Table 5. Category I, consisting of civil works,
accounted for US$20.5 million of the total amount disbursed and came short of
appraisal estimates by about US$8.0 million. This reflects the depreciation
of the drachma and the failure to complete the full project even with the
closing date extended by 42 months. The actual amount disbursed for Category
II, US$1.72 million, was close to that estimated at appraisal, US$1.6
million. The actual amounts disbursed for Categories III and IV (US$0.29
million), representing Consultants' Services and Interest during construction,
respectively, fell short of appraisal expectations by about 501 due to the
deletion of the Xanthi-Komotini Study (see para. 3.12) and the reduced
disbursement against other items.
3.21      Quarterly reports concerning the technical progress, cost estimates,
expenditures and disbursements, management and operations were inadequately
prepared and were not always received by the Bank in time, even though it was
required that these should be sent within 30 days following each



-9-
quarter. Similar delays were experienced in the submission of annual reports,
in which the details of the crop development and production, O&M, and
financial situation were to be reported.
IV. PROJECT IMPACT
Agricultural Impact
4.01      Cropping Pattern.  A comparison of the cropping pattern envisaged at
appraisal and the actual situation is shown in Annex 3, Table 1. The project
aimed at a small expansion in peach orchards, sugar beet, fodder crops and
vegetables, and a reduction in winter cereals. Such a cropping pattern would
mak" better use of the water resources and also was expected to stabilize
proud ttion. As indicated, the actual cropping pattern is close to appraisal
estimates. Some crops, notably maize, vegetables and peach, have exceeded
appraisal targets in cultivated areas three years ahead.
4.02      Crop Yields.  Preproject crop yields were very low since they were
mostly dependent on rainfall. With the project, irrigation along with
increased use of fertilizer has had a significant impact on crop yields. A
comparison of crop yields in the preproject situation, appraisal projections
and the actuals is presented in Annex 3, Table 2. Most of the crop yields
have already exceeded appraisal estimates. For example, maize yields under
irrigated conditions gave 10.5 t/ha in 1984 compared to 2.6 t/ha under rainfed
conditions giving an increase of over 300%. Similar comparisons indicate
yield increase in wheat by 74%, cotton by 125%, legumes by 144%, alfalfa by
86% and apples by 89%. Peach yields under fully irrigated conditions gave
19.4 t/ha in 1984 compared to 15.h t/ha under partially irrigated conditions,
representing an increase of 26X. The favorable results achieved thus far have
led to an upward revision of crop yields expected to be achieved by 1990.
4.03      Peach Production.  The actual peach production was greater than
appraisal estimates and reached the targets three years earlier than
envisaged. Specifically, tbe production of early and mid varieties rose by
about 30% and the late variety by about 40% in 1983, while the appraisal
estimated increases of 20% for early, 45% for mid and 35b for late varieties.
Despite the lower yields for the early varieties, they commanded a higher
price in the export market, in turn providing increased income to the farmers.
4.04      Prices.  Farmgate prices increased substantially in current terms
from the time of appraisal. Farmgate prices of the major project outputs from
1975 to 1984 are shown in Annex 3, Table 3. During the period 1975-1984, the
prices, in current terms, of wheat increased by 3251, maize by 2532, cotton by
530%, sugar beets by 223%, alfalfa by 428%, peach by 507%, apples by 2492 and
vegetables by over 1000%. Much of the increase is attributable to the very
high rate of domestic inflation in Greece luring this period and the
substantial depreciation of the Drachma. However, in real terms, the prices
have remained constant or declined, except in the case of cotton, which has
registered a 41% increase (Annex 3, Table 4).



- 10 -
Economic Impact
4.05      ProJect Beneficiaries.  The project has raised the incomes of about
14,000 farm families. Analysis of typical farm bltdgets of small, medium and
large farmers, with farm sizes of 1.0 ha, 2.5 ha, and 6.0 ha, respectively,
indicates that their incomes have, on an average, doubled in real terms from
the preproject situation to present in a period of ten years (Annex 4,
Table 2). This could mainly be attributed to change in cropping pattern from
low-value cereal crops to cash crops such as peaches and other fruits.
Moreover, substantial yield increases are another significant factor in
raising farmers' incomes.
4.06      Benefits.  The cropping pattern in the project produced tradable and
nontradable products. The tradable outputs, mostly grains and fruits, either
supplement current exports or substitute for imports. The nontradable outputs
are mainly vegetables and animal fodder. The total incremental benefit of the
project has been estimated at Dr. 2,281.3 million (US$15.2 million) and the
net benefit at Dr. 2,087.4 million (US$13.9 million) at full development in
1990.
4.07      Economic Evaluation.  The economic rate of return (ERR) has been
recalculated taking into account the actual performance of the project.
Actual and revised estimates of the cropping pattern and crop yields (Annex 3,
Tables 1 and 2) have been used to calculate crop production. Full crop
development is expected in 1990 compared to the appraisal estimate of 1987.
The quantifiable benefits are those derived from wheat, maize, legumes,
cotton, sugar beets, alfalfa, peaches, appies and other fruits. The
quantifiable costs are capital investment, operation and maintenance costs,
equipment replacement costs (once every 15 years) and crop production costs.
4.08      The evaluation of all inputs and outputs has been carried out in
constant 1985 local currency values. Local costs have been adjusted using the
domestic price index, and foreign costs have been adjusted using the World
Bank's international iaiflation estimates. Economic prices for internationally
traded crops, wheat, maize, and cotton, have been based on international price
forecasts made by the World Bank (July 1985) and are expressed in constant
1985 values. Economic prices for the other crops are the same as farmgate
prices. The conversion factor of 1.00 for nontradable commodities has been
used which is the same as at the time of appraisal.
4.09      The economic rate of return for the project has been reestimated at
15.5X as compared to 18.52 at the time of appraisal. However, LRS reestimated
the ERR to be 21% using financial prices for tradable and nont-adable goods
instead of naaving used economic prices.
4.10      Economic costs and benefits are summarized in Annex 4, Table 1.  The
reduction in the rate of return could mainly be attributed to the project cost
.verrun and lower international commodity prices of grains. The three year
delay in achieving full crop production has not adversely affected the rate of
return. Analysis of switching values indicates that the benefits have to
increase by 19b or costs to decrease by 16% in order to obtain an economic
rate of return of 18.5% obtained at appraisal.

V. INSTITUTIONAL PERPORMANCE
5.01      The Land Reclamation Service (LRS) of the Ministry of Agriculture
was the main agency responsible for project implementation under the overall
direction of a General Director who was based in Athens. The day-to-day
management of the project works was handled by a project manager. The design,
construction and mechanical divisions of LRS in Athens provided technical
assistance as necessary. The project manager coordinated his work with the
LRS head office through the Regional Director of LRS based in Thessaloniki.
Project implementation Has been continuously plagued by problems of land
acquisition, contractor's default and lack of supervision. Although it is
difficult to determine the degree of influence of each of these individual
factors, it seems, in hindsight, that strong leadership and timely action
would have reduced project delays.
Operation and Maintenance
5.02      The operation and maintenance of the irrigation system is carried
out by the Local Water Users Associations (TOBVs). There appears to be a need
for more extension efforts on operation and maintenance aspects of high
technology systems which use automatic water level regulators and modules as
outlets. Well-trained staff who are knowledgeable about this are especially
needed in the upper Edessa subarea, where such a system is in operation.
5.03      In the Tripotamos area, the TOEV uses 17 ditch riders for operation
of the system who cover an area of 11,600 ha. Maintenance of large canals is
carried out through subcontractors. This unit is managed by a staff of three,
of which two are technicians. The O&M system works efficiently with a minimum
staff.

5.04      Recovery of full investment costs is not required under a Greek law
passed in December 1972 which exempts Greek farmers from payment of most of
the capital costs of land improvement projects. However, as reflected in the
Loan Agreement, a formula was developed by the Bank in consultation with the
Greek Government providing for a partial recovery of water charges which woula
account for depreciation plus full recovery of OEM costs. Current 0&M charges
are Dr 6,000 per ha for vegetables and fruit trees, the main crops in the
area; such charges cover full O&M costs plus part of the annual depreciation
of project investments in irrigation.
Performance of the Bank
5.05      During appraisal, the Bank recommended the appointment of
consultants to assist LRS in preparing detailed designs and tender documents
for the three subprojects. The Bank, however, underestimated the time
required to prepare the final designs for tendering and for land acquisition
allowing for cumbersome local procedures. The composition and frequency of
Bank's supervision missions should be considered adequate. However, the



-12-
involvement of an experienced procurement specialist in the earlier stages
might have helped to minimize problems with contractors. The agreement in May
1979 between the Government and the Bank to conduct Joint Project
Implementation Reviews proved to be helpful, also contributing to some
improvements in project planning and monitoring of this project (see
para. 6.05).
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
6.01      The project was signed in October 1975 and was expected to be
completed in December 1979. The project implementation has undergone
substantial delays and is now expected to be completed in June 1986. The
various problems are described in the following paragraphs.
6.02      Land Acquisition.  Land acquisition from settled farmers in the
project area required cumbersome and elaborate procedures, especially since
much of the project area was under tree crops and orchards. Recognizing this
problem, the March 1976 supervision mission recommended that the LRS
administration be suitably strengthened and properly staffed. It was perhaps
too optimistic to expect thea a strengthened LRS could expedite the land
acquisition, given the constitutional protection accorded to private
property. Perhaps the delay due to land acquisition problems could have been
avoided had a thorough review of actual land tenancy conditions been carried
out at preparation and appraisal time and an appropriate acquisition plan
worked out.
6.03      Choice of Contractors.  Most of the problems related to project
implementation arose from contractor-related issues and difficulties. Either
the contractors ran into financial difficulties, or had management problems,
or faced difficulties in construction. Procurement procedures required
streamlining to assure 9 more active participation of foreign bidders. Also,
management and financial capabilities of bidders should be given proper weight
in bid evaluation process.
6.04      Lack of Planning Capability.  The implementing agencies lacked an
effective planning, monitoring and evaluation system. This resulted in the
lack of coordination between various agencies, resulting in undue delays in
project execution. However, the Joint Problem Project Reviews between the
Bank and the Government resulted in pinpointing key problem areas, followed by
appropriate palliative solutions. Further, the establishment of the
Monitoring and Supervision Unit within the Ministry of Coordination also
assisted in identifying bottlenecks in project implementation.
6.05      The Problem Projects Review conducted by the Bank and the various
implementing agencies in May 1979 had several beneficial effects. Foremost,
the increased scrutiny appeared to have improved the performance of LRS
management and working levels in the project area, especially in regard to
construction. The change in performance resulted in the LRS adhering to the
timetable for completion of project works despite the setback due to



-13-
forfeiture of the contract for the Tripotamos-Veria subarea. Secondly, the
Review resulted in the formation of a supervision unit in the Ministry of
Coordination whose objective was to achieve effective administration of the
projects by the Government.
6.06      Despite the system of monitoring and evaluation which was set up
following the Project Review being comprehensive and serving a useful purpose,
the project implementation continued to be slow. The main difficulties facing
the project were the cumbersome local procedures to terminate contracts which
were not honored by contractors.
6.07      Budget Constraints.  The Government was facing stringency in budget
resources, resulting in the diversion of local funds from Bank to other
projects. Corrective measures were instituted which linked the use of local
funds to draw down of funds from the Bank. Also, separate budgets for each
project were set up outside the ministry's main budget, making it less
flexible to allocate any savings from project-budgeted funds to other
projects. Although the allocations to these separate budgets were based upon
agreed implementation and disbursement schedules developed from the monitoring
system, the local funds were inadequate due to tight budgetary resources.
This partly explains the slow rate of disbursement.
Lessons Learned
6.08      The main lessons learned from this project are twofold, one the need
for a more thorough evaluation of alternatives in project design and two, the
need for involving the project beneficiaries more actively in the project
preparation and possibly arriving at a compromise solution in project design
prior to appraisal. Since the project covered areas under orchards, which the
farmers were reluctant to part with, public involvement would have mitigated
to some extent the strong resistance encountered during the initial stages of
project implementation.
6.09      In the case of progress reporting, the information received was
oriented towards determining the expenditure required for undertaking physical
works rather than monitoring of actual project expenditures in relation to
physical works carried out. Further, an analysis comparing expenditures and
actual physical construction with that of appraisal estimates should have been
undertaken, including a section describing the bottlenecks encountered,
solutions proposed and recommended action, with a follow-up note explaining
the result.
6.10      Reporting of crop production, costs, revenues and net returns needs
to be strengthened. Although such information is collected, it is not
organized or analyzed on a timely basis so as to enable it to serve a useful
purpose. Closer monitoring and evaluation of agricultural data would:
(a) provide a basis for analysis of the causes of lower yields and thereby
make appropriate adjustments for yield targets for the following year and
(b) analyze the relative crop profitability and thereby have a better
understanding of farmers' proditction decisions.



- 14 -
6.22      To accomplish the above, CRS staff should work more closely with the
regional staff in compilation and analysis of the agricultural data. It
should be viewed as a continuing exercise rather than a one-time effort, so
that it can serve an important role in the planning of future agricultural
projects.

La  The revised estimates were prepared In HaY 1979 to take into account the inordinate delays In project execution and were based on the
assumption that the project would be completed in June 1983 with disbursements continuing until December 1983.  This revised schedule
did not include the US O6.0 million allocated to interest during construction.
LI These revised estimtes prepared In Wovmber 1979 assumed project to be completed by June 1983 with disbursements continutng until
December 1983.
* LI These revised estimates prepared in May 1980 assumed project to be completed by October 1983 with disbursements continuing until
December 1983.
Note: The remainder of the loan of US$14.1 million representing 35.4% of the
total IRD0 loan was cancelled.
