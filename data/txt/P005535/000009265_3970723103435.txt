Terms:              Fifteen years including three years of grace with
interest at standard variable interest rate.
Project Obiectives
and Description:   The proposed project comprises a three-year time slice
(1986-88) of the five-year highway maintenance program
of MOC and DG. It aims to assist institution building
efforts in MOC and DG in: (i) highway maintenance;
(ii) project evaluation; (iii) training for DG staff;
(iv) highway safety; and (v) pavement management. The
loan will provide financing for: (a) construction of
highway maintenance workshops, work centres and training
centre extension; (b) procurement of pavement and traf-
fic data collection equipment; (c) bituminous surface
treatment; and (d) consultancy services.

SULTANATE OF OMAN
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF
A THIRD HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Sultanate of Oman has asked the Bank to continue its involve-
ment in highway maintenance. Bank participation in the highway sector began
in 1974. The proposed project, comprising highway maintenance management,
operations, training and technical assistance, would be a continuation of
the Second Highway Maintenance Project (Loan 2084-OM). It is based on the
five-year program prepared by consultants financed through that loan. A
Bank loan of US$30 million is proposed.
1.02     The report was prepared using information from the Omani authori-
ties, the Ministry of Communications (MOC), the Directorates General of
Roads (DG) and the highway maintenance and technical assistance consultants
(Dar Al-Kandasah (Shair & Partners) - Lebanon & U.K.) and on the findings of
an appraisal mission composed of Messrs. R.S.P. Bonney (Economist) and
M.R. Payne (Highway Engineer) who visited Oman in December 1984.

II. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
2.01     Until 1970 there was no modern transport system in Oman.  The high-
way network consisted of only 10 km of paved highway and an unknown length
of earthen tracks; there was limited coastal and air traffic. Today, the
country's basic transport system includes an extensive and still growing
highway network, two modern deep-water ports, an oil port, an international
airport and several civilian and military airfields. Land transport ser-
vices currently contribute about 4Z of the non-oil gross domestic product.
A. Domestic and International Network
Highways
2.02     The national highway network is under the jurisdiction of the
Directorates General of Roads (DG) within the Ministry of Communications
(MOC). For details of the network, see para. 3.01 and Annex 2. Other
special purpose roads and tracks are under the jurisdiction of the Petroleum
Development Oman (PDO) and the Ministries of Interior & Defense. The net-
work gives adequate coverage for the main needs of most regions of the
country, and provides good access to the major agricultural areas, oil
fields and population centers. The critical need now is to continue to
expand Oman's capacity to carry out effective highway maintenance.
2.03     The size of Oman and the long distances to other countries in the
region, combined with the relatively low population densities, pose chal-
lenges in establishing an economically efficient transport system that also
meets social needs. During the past ten years considerable progress has
been made in meeting these challenges and a sound basic infrastructure
framework has been developed to serve domestic and international traffic.
In the urban regions, especially the Muscat capital area, the growth of
highway traffic has been such that, despite a large highway development pro-
gram, there is still a need for major investments in highway facilities. In
the rural areas, more and more communities are being connected to the main
highway network by bituminous surface treated roads with consequent reduc-
tions in operating and maintenance costs. Traffic growth, which is pre-
dicted at between 1-1/2 and twice the rate of growth of GDP, will clearly
intensify the needs for continued highway improvements in the foreseeable
future and some older paved highways are reaching the stage where pavement
strengthening operations are needed. Furthermore, intra-regional trade is
increasing which, together with a move towards larger road vehicles, will
lead to an increased weight of traffic on international routes. Details of
major transport facilities and port airport and highway traffic are given in
the Project File (Annex 1).
Ports and Civil Aviation
2.04     Oman has a number of natural harbors, including the historically
important small port of Muscat in the Capital Area 1/. The completion of
1/ The Capital Area of approximately 350 sq. km surrounds the contiguous
cities of Muscat, Muttrah and Ruwi.



- 3 -
Port Qaboos in 1975, very close to Muscat, provided the country with a
modern deep-water port with a capacity of 1.5 million tons of cargo every
year. The port has eleven berths, ten transit sheds, a cement silo, fish
canning and general deep-freezing facilities, and a grain silo. The nearby
oil Port Fahal serves as the export terminus for Omani oil. Near the
southern town of Salalah at Raysut, port expansion was completed toward the
end of 1980 to handle one million tons a year. There are also several
natural coastal harbors for dhowL' traffic.
2.05     Civil air transport has developed and regular domestic services now
operate between Muscat, in the Capital Area, and Salalah in the South and
the regional centers at Khassab (Musandam), Bayah, Buraimi, Sur and Masira
Island. Seeb International Airport, 32 km west of Muscat, opened in late
1972 and can handle the largest commercial airplanes; expansion of the
repair and hangar facilities is underway. There are no railways in Oman,
although a study has recently been undertaken to investigate the economic
viability of building a Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) railway extending
from Iraq to Oman for mineral traffic.
B. Planning and Administration
2.06     Wrarspcrt planning and administration, excepting the Capital Area
highways, are under the direction of the MOC through two Directorates, one
in the north and the other in the south; the Development Council is respon-
sible for recommending and monitoring overall sectorial objectives and pri-
orities within the macro-framework and reports directly to the Cabinet.
Foreign technical assistance has played a significant part in the planning
process and will continue to be needed until a sufficient number of trained
and experienced Omani nationals are available to carry out the work. The
two previous Bank projects have contained important technical assistance
components which have led to significant improvements in highway maintenance
operations. These components have included major training efforts which are
now beginning to alleviate the shortages of trained Omani personnel (see
Annex 3). The proposed project aims to continue this program. Pipelines,
certain roads and related petroleum port operations are the responsibility
of the PDO.
2.07     In recent years, the Government has become increasingly aware of
the need to give proper weight to economic factors in making investment
decisions and to allocate resources to maintenance. With the recent weaken-
ing of the oil market and subsequent lessening in Government revenues, it
has become increasingly important to encourage the adequate preparation of
investment and maintenance programs and to ensure that these programs are
efficiently implemented. Although Oman has experienced rapid economic
progress in recent years, the per capita capital stock is still low, and
there remains a need to strengthen institutions, raise operational effi-
ciency and upgrade the skills of all manpower grades. While continuing to
develop the land transport system to support economic development and
1/ Small, traditional trading vessel.

political unity, the Government is becoming increasingly concerned with pro-
tecting existing investments and introducing a modern highway maintenance
program. The continuation of technical assistance and training, in parallel
with development of a periodic pavement strengthening program, is in accord
with the Bank's strategy of promoting the development of the Borrower's own
capabilities. A specific objective of the proposed project would be the
further development of suitable project evaluation procedures and criteria
in the highway sector. The implementation of the investment and maintenance
programs, prepared according tc these procedures, were agreed at
negotiations.
C. Investment Program and Economic Development
2.08     A Five-Year Economic Plan 1986-90 is being developed but it is
quite possible that the 1984/86 period may see a sigrificant slow-down in
GDP growth, especially if oil prices continue to weaken. The size of the
public sector investment budget may consequently be constrained and efforts
must be made to ensure that maintenance is not deferred to make way for
ir.-estment. Data on fixed public and private capital formation are not yet
available for 1984, but figures for 1981-83 show that investment in road
transport accounted for 33Z, 19X and 142 respectively of total infra-
structure investment (Project File B.ll). The decline, which is paralleled
in financial allocations, is to be expected as the major nighway infra-
structure is completed and the effort is transferred towards maintenance and
improvement of the existing network. Through the proposed project, the
Bank's continued participation in the transport sector would assist, through
regular supervision, in maintaining an appropriate investment/maintenance
balance.
D. Bank's Role in Transport Sector
7.09     The Bank has supported transport development in Oman through three
projects directed towards highway maintenance managemenL, operations, plan-
ning and training. These were Loan 985-OM (US$1.2 million for the highway
sector component), Loan 1441-OM (US$15 million) and Loan 2084-OM
(US$15 million), approved by the Board in March 1974, May 1977 and March
1982 respectively.
2.10     Loan 985-OM, which was a technical assistance loan to cover plan-
ning in agriculture and transport, led to the preparation by consultants of
Oman's first five-year highway maintenance program and this, in turn, pro-
vided the basic input for Loan 1441-OM which comprised a three-year portion
(1978-81) of the five-year maintenance program and included procurement of a
highway maintenance equipment and spare parts, construction of workshops and
a training center, a training program for highway maintenance personnel and
technical assistance by consultants for highway maintenance management,
operations and training. Loan 2084-OM covers a three-year portion of
Oman's 1981-85 highway maintenance program and is expected to be completed
in December 1985: it comprises a continuation of highway routine and peri-
odic maintenance, construction and/or modification of highway maintenance
centers, maintenance equipment and spare parts, technical assistance, high-
way maintenance cost accounting and training. A P-oject Completion Report
for Loan 1441-OM, which was fully disbursed in May 1985, was prepared by
August 1985.



-5-
2.11     The completion of the first project was delayed by almost three and
a half years due to slow start-up and finalization of design modifications
to previously completed workshops; the second project is expected to be com-
pleted six months later than expected. The projects have been achieving
their objectives and are being increasingly satisfactorily implemented,
leading to significant advances in the level and quality of highway mainte-
nance works. There is still a shortage of trained and experienced Omani
staff, especially at more senior levels: the training progress made to date
and estimated future training needs are described in Annex 3. In 1985,
under the ongoing project, the number of Omani trainees will reach a peak
and thereafter will continue to sustain the annual training requirements.
Continued Bank involvement in the expansion of the support infrastructure
required for systematic highway maintenance, especially regional workshops
and work centers, and in the management, operational and training aspects
would ensure further improvement of maintenance effectiveness. In particu-
lar, continued technical assistance would help develop a planned program of
periodic maintenance for those highway sections that are now approaching
fatigue limits.
2.12     Under the proposed project, further technical assistance and train-
ing would be provided to sustain and consolidate the institutional gains
achieved under the first and second Highway Maintenance Projects; support
infrastructure would be extended to periodic maintenance operations, plan-
ning and pavement management with the objective of the gradual phasing out
of expatriate technical assistance in the highway subsector. A further
important component is the program to upgrade approximately 800 km of
heavily trafficked unpaved roads and to provide them with double surface
treatment wearing courses. For the most part, these roads link population
centers with the primary road network and carry average daily traffic in
excess of 400 vehicles. This program will be an important element in the
development of Oman's highway maintenance operations.

III. HIGHWAYS AND ROAD TRANSPORT
A. The Highway Network
3.01     Since 1973 the network of tracks and gravel roads waintained by the
Northern and Southern Directorates General of Roads (DG) has expanded from
about 2,500 km to 9,748 km and the network of paved highways (asphaltic con-
crete) has increased from about 300 km to 3,267 km (Annex 2 and Map 18682).
This growth represents a major increase in the responsibilities of the DG
and has been an essential factor in the development of the country's
resources and in providing necessary territorial administrative and social
services. The average annual growth in the paved network has amounted to
nearly 301 and overall vehicle fleet growth has been about 22X annually.
Road accidents over the same period have grown at an annual rate of about
222 and, whilst improving relative to estimated traffic growth, the total
number of accidents is still serious. Fuller details of the development of
the highway system and design standards are given in the Project File
(Annex 1).
B. Traffic and Vehicle Operating Costs
3.02     Traffic statistics in Oman are not good and this hampers highway
planning. Furthermore, vehicle ownership data are not recorded in suffi-
cient detail to establish a reliable fleet composition by vehicle type and
may also overestimate the fleet size. Government is aware of these problems
and proposes to take action to remedy them and the proposed project would
assist in this (see following para. 3.03). The estimated growth in the
vehicle fleet is shown in the table below:

3.03     In recent years, the income elasticity of frelght transport demand
in Oman has been between 1.5 and 2.0: if the GDP continues to grow at about
5 p.a. the medium term growth rate in commercial vehicles could be of the
order of 10X. Growth in passenger traffic (in 1984 about 512 of the total
vehicle fleet of 188,827) depends on a number of factors most important of
which is probably vehicle ownership. A recent study indicates that passen-
ger vehicle ownership saturation in Oman will be at che level of about 0.3
vehicles per capita (similar to Western Europe) and current ownership is
about 0.06 passenger cars per capita. As there is an inverse relationship
between, inter alia, the incidence of vehicle ownership and the growth in
vehicle ownership, the Oman situation indicates that there is considerable
scope for further growth in passenger car traffic - especially in areas away
from the major cities. Whilst there will be considerable regional vari-
ations, and growth rates will be influenced by conditions in neighboring
countries, the overall traffic growth rate will probably be in excess of 102
p.a. It is, however, especially important that traffic study and fore-
casting resources are strengthened and forecasts are reviewed regularly; the
proposcd project will support this objective through technical assistance
and traffic equipment procurement. In 1983, there were 270 companies
registered in the transport category but it is estimated that there are
about 480 truck owners varying from single vehicle concerns to large
companies. The industry is limited to Omani ownership but is competitive
and entry is free and controlled only through vehicle construction and use
regulations. The national bus company is Government controlled and provides
a comprehensive urban and inter-urban service.
3.04     Vehicle operating costs (VOC) for standard vehicles are given in
detail in the vehicle operating cost tables in the Project File (Annex 1).
Costs have decreased slightly since 1981, generally due to lower tyre and
vehicle prices and a minor decline in the price of regular gasoline. The
1984 base costs on smooth, flat, tangential roads are:
Passenger car at 60 km/h                  11.1 US cents/km
Four-wheel drive pick-up at 60 km/h       32.5 US cents/km
7-ton diesel truck at 50 km/h             43.0 US cents/km
The economic analysis employed in preparing the 1986-91 Highway Maintenance
Plan has used these costs together with the following coefficients for
adjusting the VOC for different operating conditions:

In addition to these road types, running costs on unmaintained tracks have
been estimated by multiplying Track (T) running costs by 1.55, 1.35 and 1.45
fnr cars, light commercial and trucks respectively: fixed costs are assumed
to e unchanged.
C. Higliway Safety
. ^'   Accident data are rather sparse and generalized.  However, there
are an estimated 12,000 road accidents per annum of which about 300 are
fatal. The accident rate (vehicles per capita compared with accidents per
10,000 population) for all accidents is about twice the rate in the USA and
the United Kingdom, and road fatalities compared in the same way are about
three times higher. Using modern accident forecasting methods, the accident
rate in Oman is slightly above what would be expected at its stage of high-
way and traffic development and, as vehicle ownership rates increase, and if
traffic regulation is effectively enforced, the incidence of road accidents
should decrease. Nonetheless, rcad safety remains a serious problem. An
action plan to institute adequate data collection and analysis systems has
been prepared and will be implemented as indicated in the project implemen-
tation schedule (see Annexes 11 and 15). An action plan to institute ade--
quate data collection and analysis systems has been prepared and will be
implemented as indicated in the Project Implementation Schedule (Annex 11).
D. Road User Charges and Revenues
3.06     Direct road user revenues consist of license and vehicle registra-
tion fees and import duties. Import duties on vehicles and spare parts is
about 8Z ad valorem but no separate figures are available for these. Since
average import duties in Oman are extremely low, almost the entire amount of
this 8% duty may be considered as a road user charge. Typical annual vehi-
cle registration fees are:
Passenger car                       RO  41 : US$120
Commercial vehicle under 3 tons    RO  66 : US$194
Commercial vehicles 3-5 tons        RO 131 : US$384
Commercial vehicle over 5 tons      RO 191 : US$560
Indirect road user revenues may also be derived from the rent element 1/ in
fuel prices which accrue to the Government to the extent that these exceed
the export price, although there is no specific figure for this element as
production costs are not available. Nonetheless, for a low cost producer
the prices of gasoline and diesel, at about US$1.28 and US$1.26 (equivalent)
per US gallon, indicate a large rent element 11. Crude oil, used in produc-
ing petroleum products for sale in Oman, carries a premium of approximately
10X, introduced in 1983, which is passed on in the price to the road user;
in 1983 this source of revenue amounted to US$50 million. Road user reve-
nues are thus more than adequate to cover routine maintenance and sufficient
to meet, at least, that part of the investment budget allocated to periodic
maintenance (strengthening) of asphalt highways (see Table 3.5, page 11).

3.07     Fuel consumption in Oman has been growing at a significantly slower
rate than the vehicle fleet; this applies to both gasoline and diesel.
Between 1978 and 1982 the average consumption of fuel per vehicle has
declined by approximately a third from 6.8 tons/year per vehicle to
4.4 tons/year per vehicle. Factors which contribute to this trend are:
(a)  improved highway system has led to lower fuel consumption and
fewer high consumption multi-axle drive vehicles;
(b)  a strong trend towards more fuel efficient vehicles;
(c)  a growing concentration of vehicles in urban centers and a
consequent reduction in annual vehicle kilometers operated; and
Ed)  increasing vehicle ownership levels that tend to lead to a
reduction in average annual vehicle kilometers.
Consumption of gasoline and diesel has been:

E. Highway Maintenance and Investment
3.08     The highways maintenance organization comprises a Directorate
General of Roads for the Northern Region based in Muscat and the Directorate
of Roads for the Southern Region based in Salalah. Both Directorates have a
direct responsibility to the Undersecretary of the MOC. Each Northern and
Southern Directorate comprises a headquarters, work centers, specialized
maintenance teams, workshops and training units. The detailed organizations
are given at Annexes 4 and 5.  Whilst the organizational structure of the
Directorates is sound and appropriate for carrying out their duties they are
constrained by staff shortages, especially at sub-professional and profes-
sional levels. This situation is improving, aided by training programs
under the First and Second Highway Maintenance Projects (Loans 1441-OM and
2084-OM), but the satisfactory filling of most senior professional and many
sub-professional positions still depends on employment of consultants and
recruitment of expatriates. Since this need for expatriate assistance is
expected to continue for some time, technical assistance and an extended
training program will be important components of the proposed project.
3.09     Highway maintenance planning and control is carried out by the
MOC's two DG's, whilst planning and control of highway investment is con-
trolled by the MOC headquarters, assisted by consultants. Overall planning
and budgeting direction is exercised by the Ministry of Finance and the
Development Council. Planning in the formal sense is relatively new in
Oman. An objective of the proposed project will be to assist in furthering
the adoption of modern planning procedures and evaluation techniques. Out-
line proposals for appropriate project evaluation guidelines are given at
Annex 6 and during project implementation, the Government, with the assis-
tance of consultants, will develop these to more appropriately reflect Omani
conditions. A modified draft in Arabic and in English of the guidelines
will be prepared and will be jointly reviewed by the Government and the
World Bank in accordance with the Project Implementation Schedule (Annex 11).
3.10     The 1981-85 expenditures and planned expenditures on highway
investment and highway maintenance are shown in Table 3.5. Until 1984,
little periodic maintenance was undertaken, or needed, due to the relatively
new paved road system (see para. 4.04). Maintenance of gravel roads and
tracks was mainly limited to grading and other routine works. However,
starting in 1984 periodic maintenance of paved roads, including pavement
strengthening became important and a program of bituminous surface treatment
and regravelling also started. In 1984 periodic maintenance was about OR
2.5 million (US$7.5 million equivalent) and in 1985 may be about the same
level.

Source: Ministry of Communications
The paved highway system increased from 10 km in 1970 to 3,267 km at the end
of 1983. An estimated 1,300 km of paved highways will have been added
between 1980 and 1985. The most rapid growth taking place in 1976, 1981 and
1982 when 511 km, 400 km and 700 km respectively of highways were con-
structed and paved with asphaltic concrete (Annex 2). Provisional invest-
ment and maintenance figures for 1986-90 are discussed in para. 3.12.
3.11     During the 1986-90 Plan it will be necessary to provide sufficient
trained personnel and equipment for the highway maintenance cost accounting
system's effective operation and the proposed project whould assist this
through training and technical assistance.
3.12     As approximately 70S of the basic highway infrastructure has been
established, the thrust of highway strategy now is towards highway routine
and periodic maintenance and strengthening and upgrading the existing
network. An exception to this is the continuing need to allocate consider-
able resources to the development plan for the Capital Area where severe
urban traffic problems, involving flows up to 50,000 vpd, are being ad-
dressed by construction of interchanges, widening and new highways, often in
difficult rocky terrain and under complicated construction conditions. This
accounts for the bulk of investment being carried out in the final two years
of the current 1981-85 plan. The Capital Area highway system is no longer
the responsibility of the Ministry of Communications but the Ministry of
Diwan Affairs.3'
3.13     The proposed 1986-90 highway maintenance program indicates a budget
level for routine and periodic maintenance of about OR 20 million (US$58
million) p.a. This amount includes certain improvements and equipment/
buildings but overall amounts to about US$4,500/km p.a. The relatively

high cost/km is partly the result of harsh terrain, abrasive materials,
water scarcity, long distances and an underdeveloped maintenance
organization, and partly due to the existence of a large kilometrage of
gravel surfaced roads carrying relatively high traffic flows. It is
proposed to address this matter through improvements to the highway
maintenance system including a program of surface treatment of heavily
trafficked links to the primary network.
3.14     The proposed 1986-90 investment program is at an earlier stage of
review but, excluding the Capital Area, it may lead to average annual
investment expenditure of about OR 70 million (US$200 million) allocated
mainly to highway improvements. The balance between highway maintenance and
investment, given the level of development of the system and traffic demand,
is appropriate.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01     The overall objective is the furtherance of a sustainable system of
highway maintenance in Oman through:
(a) strengthening of project preparation, planning and implementa-
tion procedures including the development of guidelines for
project and program economic evaluation and the introduction of
a pavement management system;
(b) promoting and sustaining effective routine and periodic highway
maintenance through the development of support infrastructure
(highway workshops, work centres, pavement and traffic data
equipment) and sound woLk programs aided by Bank participation
in selection of priority works;
(c) training local personnel in necessary skills to undertake plan-
ning, implementation and monitoring tasks to achieve Oman's
highway maintenance, investment and highway safety programs; and
(d) the development of an effective program for the control and
limitation of highway accidents.
These objectives were discussed with Government at appraisal and were con-
firmed at negotiations.
B. Project Description
4.02     The proposed project, a continuation of the Second Highway
Maintenance Project (Loan 2084-OM), would address the first three years
(1986-88) of the DG's 1986-1990 highway maintenance program including:
(a) periodic and routine maintenance, minor improvement and
strengthening of highways;
(b) bituminous surface treatment;
(c) construction of workshops, highway maintenance centers and
training center extension;
(d) equipment and spare parts for highway maintenance, workshops,
pavement data collection and processing, and highway safety; and
(e) technical assistance to the MOC and DG, including training of
staff.



- 14 -
4.03     The proposed loan would finance all or part of the foreign exchange
content during 1986-1988 of:
(a) equipment, spare parts and materials for highway data collection
and processing, and highway safety;
(b) construction of workshops, highway maintenance work centers and
training center extension;
(c) bituminous surface treatment; and
(d) consultant services and individual specialists for highway main-
tenance, pavement management, cost accounting, training, highway
safety and general technical assistance.
Periodic Maintenance and Minor Improvements
4.04     The Omani paved highway network has increased from 10 km in 1970 to
3,267 km in 1984 and is predominantly of high pavement design standard with'
weighted average age of just under 6 years. Approximately 700 km are over 8
years old, of which 78 km (Dhank Junction-Hafit) were overlaid in 1983/84;
most of the remaining 620 km are expected to require overlays during the
1986-1990 five-year maintenance program as highway pavements deteriorate
under accumulations of axle loads. In addition, provision has been made for
double bituminous surface treatment of approximately 800 km of heavily
trafficked connections to the primary network (see Annex 17) and gravel
replenishment of approximately 1,500 km of unpaved roads.
4.05     Periodic maintenance for paved and gravel roads, the program for
which is detailed in the Draft 1986-90 Highway Master Plan (see Project File
Document Bl and para. 5.07), would be planned and supervised by consultants
appointed under the proposed project. The sections have been identified
from technical and economic evaluations that demonstrate an aconomic return
of at least 12Z for each highway or highway section (see paras. 3.09 and
5.07).
Routine Maintenance
4.06     As for the First and Second Highway Maintenance Projects, the
day-to-day cost of operations (salaries, wages, fuels, oils, lubricants,
etc.) represent recurrent expenditures not eligible for reimbursement from
the proceeds of the loan. These are part of the overall cost of the project
and would be met from Government funds (see para. 4.33). The program is
detailed in Project File Documents B2 and B3(see Annex 1). Please refer to
Annex 7 for details of recurrent expenditures 1981-1985.
Consultant Services and Individual Specialists
4.07     During negotiations, the MOC and DG stated that they would call for
proposals from a short list of consulting firms, including the consultants
currently undertaking technical assistance under the Second Highway
Maintenance Project. This would be done in accordance with the procedures
set out in the Bank's "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency". August 1981 edition.



- 15 -
Proposals for (i) highway maintenance management, operations and training
for the DG and (ii) general technical assistance to MOC would be called for
in Septemoer/October 1986 to endeavour to ensure continuity between con-
sultants' services under the Second and Proposed Third Highway Maintenance
Projects.
4.08     Terms of reference for the consultants' services under this Project
were discussed at appraisal and have been prepared by appropriate modifica-
tions to the terms of reference for the ongoing Second Project (see Annex 1,
Document B13). The modifications were discussed and agreed at negotiations
and include provisions for expanding the technical assistance to the MOC and
DG for:
(a) highway maintenance management and operations (132 man-months);
(b) pavement management (24 man-months);
(c) cost accounting (12 man-months);
Cd) the training program for highway maintenance supervisors,
operators and mechanics (132 man-months);
Ce) highway safety (24 man-months); and
Cf) general technical assistance in administrative, planning and
operations support of MOC and DG, including the collection and
processing of pavement and traffic data (132 man-months).
4.09     The project also provides for 60 man-months of in-line services of
individual specialists, such as a highway safety expert, and technicians
within the DC's organization. Specific job titles, descriptions and
man-months are in accordance with a Training Plan of Action prepared by the
consultants under the Second Highway Maintenance Project and adopted by the
DG.
Training
4.10     The three-year (1986 to 1988) training program for highway mainte-
nance personnel would carry on the program begun under the First Highway
Maintenance Project and continued in the Second and would be specially
addressed to maintenance supervisors, equipment operators, drivers and
mechanics. Training results are encouraging and the throughput of trainees
is increasing satisfactorily - 105 attended courses in 1983, 291 in 1984 and
616 are planned for 1985. The 1986-1988 training program aims to provide
instructional courses for 310, 390 and 450 trainees respectively. The over-
all training program is aimed at substantial reduction of reliance on expa-
triate skill by the project end (see Annex 3).
4.11     Technical assistance and Arabic-speaking instructors required for
the implementation of the three-year program would be provided under the
project. Newly-trained Omani instructors would continue to be upgraded and
work alongside the training specialists. One of the expatriate staff would



- 16 -
act as the senior training adviser to DG, and be responsible for planning,
implementing and supervising all DG training activities which are directed
by a Training Committee through a Training Section Chief.
4.12     The program would include the continued operation of the road and
mechanical training production units (RTPU and MTPU), the Training Section
in DG (established under Loan 1441-OM), the procurement of training equip-
ment and materials, the continuation of training consultancy services, and
the recruitment of Omani and/or other Arabic-speaking instructors.
4.13     Road foremen/supervisors and operators/drivers would undergo field
training at the RTPU to gain experience under actual working conditions.
4.14     Training of mechanical staff would be conducted mostly at the
Azaiba workshop (MTPU). Repairing worn and broken-down and servicing new
equipment would continue to form the basis of the training of mechanical
personnel.
4.15     Periodic sem-nars would be held regularly for middle and high-level
staff by technical assistance specialists.
4.16     Details of the training program, including the funds for implemen-
tation and operation of the RTPU and MTPU, were discussed and agreed during
negotiations (see Annex 3 for estimated training requirements).
Construction of Workshops, Highway Maintenance Centers
and Training Center Extension
4.17     Included in the project are two new workshops proposed at Ibra and
Haima to complement the four workshops at Azaiba, Salalah, Ibri and
Al Ghaliel constructed in 1982 under the First Highway Maintenance Project.
Their construction would complete the original program envisaged under the
First Highway Maintenance Project. Ibra workshop would serve Eastern Areas
A & B and Haima, Interior B (see Map 18682).
4.18     Also included in the project is the DG program for development of
24 work centers throughout the country either by new construction or modifi-
cation of contractor's camps after completion of highway construction
(Annex 8). Work centers are sited within the maintenance areas into which
the national network has been divided (see Map 18682). The work center pro-
gram began in 1984 with construction at Ibra. Two more work centers at Ibri
and Birkat Al Mawz are scheduled to be built in 1985 under the ongoing
Second Highway Project (Loan 2084-OM). For the 24 work centers in the proj-
ect (19 in the North, 1 on Masira Island and 4 in the South) the intended
phasing of construction is 8 in 1986, 8 in 1987 and 8 in 1988.
4.19     The first phase of the training center at Azaiba, near Muscat, was
completed in October 1980. The second phase, included in the proposed proj-
ect, will provide extra classrooms and offices that are needed now to cope
with the expanding and continuous training program.

Highway Maintenance Equipment and Spare Parts
4.20     The numbers and types of Ihighway maintenance equipment and spare
parts to be procured have been asse^sed from the numbers and condition of
the existing inventory, work loads by usint--nance activity, equipment pro-
ductivity rates and spare parts consumption rates. A provisional list of
equipment and related spares to be procured was discussed during negotia-
tions (see Project File Document B12 and Annex 16).
Equipment, Spare Parts and Materials for:
4.21     Highway Data Collection and Processing.  The project includes extra
pavement data collection equipment to supplement that procured under the
Second Highway Maintenance Project so that data can be collected simulta-
neously at several selected locations on the highway network for the pur-
poses of highway maintenance, construction planning, pavement management and
axle load control consistent with legal vehicle construction and use regu-
lations. A provisional list of equipment was discussed at negotiations (see
Project File Document B12).
4.22     Highway Safety.  Materials such as guard rails, highway signs and
equipment such as skid resistance meters would be part of the project. A
list of equipment and materials would be prepared after the consultants have
undertaken a preliminary study.
4.23     Training.  Extra items of equipment to supplement the training
equipment procured under the First and Second Highway Maintenance Projects
will be procured by the DG as necessary to operate the training centre
extension.
C. Engineering
4.24     The five-year maintenance program was developed by the technical
assistance consultants to the DG under the previous Loan 2084-OM (see
Project File Documents B2 to B8) and is satisfactory.
4.25     For asphaltic overlays and bituminous surface treatment, the DG,
with the help of the technical assistance consultants, will continue to col-
lect data, including traffic counts, axle load data, and deflection tests on
which to base the detailed designs and timings of the overlays and surface
treatment of those sections which have been identified as having an economic
return of not less than 122 (see paras. 3.09, 4.05 and 5.07).
4.26     Standard work center designs and bidding documents have been pre-
pared by consultants; layouts will be modified as required to suit particu-
lar site conditions.
4.27     The second phase of the training center has been designed by adapt-
ing the original design to take account of the present and future training
needs.

4.29     The total capital cost of the proposed three-year proiect has been
estimated on the basis of the costs and experience from the first two high-
way maintenance project at US$109 million in June 1985 prices of which
US$74 million is foreign exchange; physical and price contingencies raise
these estimates to US$137 million and US$92 million respectively giving a
foreign exchange component of 67X. Total cost of the proposed three-year
project including recurrent costs is US$192 million of which US$110 million
(57Z) is foreign exchange.
4.30     The total cost for the five-year program including routine mainte-
nance has been estimated at US$194 million in June 1985 prices of which
US$130 million is foreign exchange; physical and price contingencies raise
chese estimates to US$295 million and US$163 million respectively (see
Annex 9).
4.31     During negotiations, the cost estimates of the three-year project
and the five-year program were dismussed with and confirmed by the
Government's representatives (Table 4.1 and Annex 9).
E. Financing
4.32     The proposed loan of US$30 million, which would finance specific
project items as shown in para. 4.03, represents 222 of the total cost of
the three-year project and 152 of the five-year program excluding routine
maintenance costs and 16? and 10X including routine maintenance costs. The
loan would be made to the Government of the Sultanate of Oman; the direct
beneficiaries of the loan are the MOC and the DG. The Government would
finance the additional foreign costs of the five-year program (US$133
million) and all local costs (US$132 million) of which less than US$2
million is direct taxes.
F. Implementation
Responsibility for Implementation and Supervision
4.33     The MOC, with the assistance of consultants, would be responsible
for the procurement of construction and supervision of periodic maintenance
asphalt overlays, bituminous surface treatment, workshops, work centers,
training center extension and highway maintenance equipment and spare
parts. The DG, in the Northern and Southern Regions, also with the assis-
tance of consultants, would be responsible for the highway maintenance man-
agement, operation and training programs, including the procurement of
equipment and spare parts for workshops, work centers, training, pavement
data collection and highway safety.
Procurement
Bank-Financed Components
4.34     The equipment for pavement data collection and highway safety is
varied and specialized, with maximum size of individual contracts being
under $50,000 and in aggregate value not exceeding $370,000. Depending on
the degree of specialization, most of this equipment which is specialized or



- 20 -
proprietary in nature will be procured through international shopping, in
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.
4.35     Contracts for bituminous surface treatment will be awarded after
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's
"Guidelines for Procurement". Works would be packaged to make the contracts
attractive to larger contractors.
4.36     Contracts for the construction of highway maintenance workshops,
work centres and the training centre extension will be awarded after Local
Competitive Bidding (LCB) under procedures which are satisfactory to the
Bank subject to certain modifications and waivers which were discussed and
agreed during negotiations. The simple nature of construction, the scope of
work and the proposed program of construction render LCB appropriate since
(i) ample competition is assured through the participation of numerous local
and foreign contractors already working in Oman and other interested foreign
firms may participate in the bidding; (ii) the work sites are widely scat-
tered geographically which restricts packaging; and (iii) the construction
schedule of about R units per year over three years has been planned to
correspond to the build-up of trained personnel to man the facilities and
allows time for design layout cnanges to be made to suit site conditions.
4.37     All procurement documentation for the pavement data collection and
safety equipment and for the workshops, work centers and training center
extension and bituminous surface treatment contracts will be reviewed by the
Bank before being issued. All proposed contracts, together with bidding
analysis, will be subject to Bank review prior to contract award except the
specialized equipment contracts, which will be subject to selective post
review.
4.38     The maintenance management/training and general technical assis-
tance would be carried out by qualified and experienced consultants selected
in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines on the Use of Consultants" (see
para. 4.08).
Non Bank-Financed Components
4.39     The periodic maintenance program contracts would be procured
through ICB procurement procedures which allow the many local and foreign
contractors already working in Oman to participate; other interested foreign
firms are also allowed to bid and, if successful, must register in Oman.
For other maintenance contracts such as regravelling, the bid invitations
will be advertised regionally. Equipment procurement will follow procedures
very similar to international competitive bidding with international
advertising.
4.40     During loan negotiations, the methods of procurement were confirmed
with Government.

Proiect Implementation Schedule
4.41     The highway maintenance program finonced under this loan would
cover a period of three years beginning January 1986. Asphalt overlays are
expected to start in late 1985. Highway equipment is expected to be pro-
cured annually with the main order occurring in 1986. Bids for construction
of highway workshops are expected in 1986 and 1987; bids for work centers
are expected to begin in mid-1986 and be repeated in 1987 and 1988. The
training program and the general technical assistance, including project
evaluation, highway safety, cost accounting and pavement management, would
effectively be a continuation of the program financed under Loan 1441-OM,



- 22 -
which started at the beginning of 1978, and Loan 2084-OM, which ends in
December 1985. During negotiations, it was agreed that by the dates
specified in the project implementation schedule: (i) the highway
maintenance cost accounting system will be fully implemented; and (ii) a
report describing in detail the proposed pavement management system and
implementation schedule will be prepared and submitted to the Bank. The
four-year implementation schedule, which was discussed and confirmed with
the Government during negotiations, is shown in Annex 11.
G. Disbursements
4.42     The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would be disbursed on the
following basis:
(a) 95X of the total costs of pavement data collection and highway
safety equipment;
(b) 80X of the total costs of highway workshops, which represents
the estimated foreign exchange component of this item;
Cc) 60% of the total costs of bituminous surface treatment, which
represents the foreign exchange component of this item;
-d) 50Z of the total costs of highway work centers and training
center extension, which represents the estimated foreign
exchange component of this item; and
(e)  75Z of the total costs of the consultants undertaking mainte-
nance management/training and general technical assistance and
of individual technicians serving directly on DG staff.
4.43     The estimated cumulative quarterly disbursement schedule shown in
Annex 10 assumes that the loan would be disbursed in five years. During
negotiations the Government and the Bank discussed and confirmed the
schedule of disbursements. The estimated disbursement schedule, which has
taken into account the disbursement performance under the Second Highway
Maintenance Project, is compared with the historical Bank disbursement pro-
file for highway projects in Annex 10; this shows that the proposed loan
would be disbursed at a somewhat faster rate than the historical profile
because more than 60S of the loan proceeds are applied to relatively short
duration construction of highway maintenance support infrastructure and
fixed term technical assistance.
4.44     The closing date for the proposed loan is June 30, 1990. To enable
prompt payment of all reimbursable expenses, provision will be made for a
revolving fund through a special account in US$, opened and operated in the
Central Bank of Oman. After loan effectiveness and at the request of the
Borrower, the Bank would disburse into this account US$1 million, an esti-
mated three-months needs of the Bank share of eligible expenditures. The
account would be replenished periodically on the basis of withdrawal appli-
cations supported by the Central Bank's statements of account and details of
expenditures.  During negotiations agreement was reached on this disburse-
ment mechanism.



- 23 -
H. Environmental Impact
4.45     The project elements have no detrimental effects on the environment.
I. Accounting Systems and Auditing
4.46     Government accounting, budget preparation, monitoring and auditing
are undertaken thoroughly in Oman (Annex 12) and are consistent with those
of other countries of the region. Bank review of the system shows that the
quality of budget preparation, control of expenditures and accounting pro-
cedures is acceptable and adequate in scope and in the comprehensiveness of
checks and balances. In addition to audit within the spending agencies and
by the Ministry of Finance, there is an independent Financial Inspector
Directorate of the Cabinet which audits selected accounts but the prepara-
tion of audit reports and certificates by this body is not normal practice.
The professional ability and independence of this Directorate is acceptable
to the Bank and agreement was reached at negotiations that an adequate form
of audit report for the separate, special project account will be prepared
and submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the end of each
fiscal year. Assurances were obtained from Government during appraisal and
negotiations that a separate project account would be maintained and the
form of this was confirmed at negotiations.

V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Benefits and Beneficiaries
5.01     The proposed project will continue to support the development of
the MOC Directorates' capabilities for cost effective routine and periodic
highway maintenance and the implementation of a pavement management program,
thereby deriving significant economic benefits from preserving and strength-
ening the national highway network and limiting vehicle operating costs. At
the same time, technical assistance will be provided to support these opera-
tions and to assist in designing and implementing appropriate data collec-
tion methods and project evaluation techniques that will facilitate the
identification of economically viable highway projects.
5.02     Economic benefits generated by the proposed project will accrue to:
(a)  the Sultanate Government through the development of more cost
effective routine and periodic maintenance which, in turn,
will save money through preserving the existing infrastructure
and, as a result of the training program, reduce dependence on
expatriate staff;
(b)  the road transport industry as a result of lower vehicle
operating costs and an increased opportunity to serve wider
markets; and
(c)  owner drivers of passenger and "own-account" commercial
vehicles.
Free competition exists in the road transport industry and, if lower vehicle
operating costs are achieved as a result of highway improvements and mainte-
nance, it is possible that some benefits could filter down to other sectors
of the community in the form of lower transport prices. However, it is more
likely that the benefits will take the form of improvements in reliability
and accessibility of the transport services particularly in remote areas.
5.03     The project should also lead to improvements in traffic safety
through highway improvements (including pavement markings and road furni-
ture), vehicle controls and highway user education.
B. Economic Evaluation
Routine Highway Maintenance
5.04     It is evident that highways must be maintained to fulfill their
designated functions in the most cost effective way, including the prolonga-
tion of their economic lives. Whilst the Bank loan would not finance rou-
tine maintenance and workshop equipment, it would include finance for
workshop and work center facilities and technical assistance which make a
significant contribution to developing an effective highway routine



w
- 25 -
maintenance system. Moreover, the continued development of effective
routine maintenance is a condition of Bank participation. In Bank-financed
projects where an economic analysis has been made of routine maintenance,
rates of return have frequently exceeded 100X and have seldom been less than
40Z. The ongoing Second Oman Highway Maintenance Project was estimated to
yield a rate of return of 44Z on overall routine maintenance. Employing the
results of recent researches (e.g. the Highway Design Model (HDM) and Road
Transport Investment Model (RTIM) pavement performance/vehicle operating
cost sub-models), the Oman 1986-90 routine maintenance program for unpaved
roads and paved highways has been developed to maximize the net present
values of benefits derived from vehicle operating cost savings, highway
maintenance cost savings and from limiting pavement reconstruction costs.
Accordingly, and varying with highway standard and traffic flow, optimal
routine maintenance procedures have been designed so that the NPV is always
maximized when using a 12X discount rate. The results of these maintenance
procedures will be monitored through the new DG cost accounting system and
field measurements to be financed under the proposed project. On average,
the incremental rate of return achieved by moving from a maintenance budget
of 50Z of the estimated optimal budget to the optimal budget level is about
lOOZ. but although the NPV continues to increase at maintenance levels up to
50S above the estimated optimum maintenance expenditure, there are diminish-
ing returns. The formal methodology through which these maintenance levels
were derived are described in the Project File (Annex 1). Optimum levels of
routine maintenance vary according to highway type and traffic partic-
ularly. Unpaved roads are especially sensitive to traffic flows. In 1984
prices optimum routine maintenance for asphaltic concrete roads is estimated
at US$1,860 per kilometer per year.
Periodic Highway Maintenance and Improvement
5.05     The progressive introduction of a properly researched highway pave-
ment management program in Oman is being prepared. Such a system should not
require frequent specialized studies but should facilitate planning and
implementing technically and economically sound highway maintenance and
betterment programs. It should also analyze the merits of alternative
policies or policy mixes of maintenance and improvement. Where it can be
shown that different policies, such as upgrading gravel surfaced roads to
double surface treatment roads or the earlier provision of an overlay or
strengthening layers, yield incremental cost: benefit ratios greater than
1.0 at an appropriate discount rate (currently 122) they will be recommended
for inclusion in the highway program.
5.06     As an interim measure, a number of traffic thresholds relating
types of road and periodic maintenance or improvement policies have been
established. These thresholds have been used in developing the 1986-90
Highway Maintenance Program. Roads identified in this process, or through
the use of traffic warrants, are then subjected to more detailed individual
analysis. Examples of these relationships as applied to asphalt overlay
work are given in Annex 13.
5.07     Between 1970 and 1976, the kilometrage of asphaltic concrete roads
increased from practically zero to 1,219 km. Some of the pavements have
already required overlaying and strengthening together with some geometric
improvements (para. 4.04), and the Bank's participation in the Second
Highway Maintenance has assisted in this. The need to resurface, strengthen



- 26 -
and in some cases upgrade the older roads in the highway network continues,
and a priority highway overlay and strengthening program has been identified:

This provisional program will be reviewed regularly by the Sultanate
Government, and final scheduling of works will be coordinated with resource
availability and continued pavement monitoring. The overall rate of return
is acceptable and all projects exceed the test discount rate of 12X.
5.08     As the program of highway periodic maintenance and strengthening is
placed on a regular planned basis, with adequate resource allocation, atten-
tion must turn to the modernization of the secondary and tertiary highway
networks. In particular, attention will be paid to rationalizing this sys-
tem and concentrating planning and implementation effort on the economically
critical links. The technical assistance component of the ongoing Highway
Maintenance Project has already developed certain daily traffic thresholds
for upgrading unpaved roads based on savings in VOC and highway maintenance

costs and which meet a 12% rate of return criterion.  These thresho1dq have
been used in establishing in programme of surface dressing described In
Annex 17 and to be financed under the project. Currently thresholds are:

Improved to          Improve to
Terrain         Leave as Track          Compacted          Surface Treated

Hilly              Less than 300           300 - 350          Greater than 350
Mountainous        Less than 350           350 - 425          Greater than 425
Note: Clearly flexibility must be exercised to permit practicable stage
construction policies: e.g. it would not be sensible to improve to
compacted a track carrying 350 vpd unless there is zero growth.
These thresholds will be studied and refined as more traffic, construction
cost (currently estimated contract prices are $75,000 per km) and road per-
formance data become available. Moreover, the scope of the analysis
described in Chapter 6 of the 1986-90 Highway Maintenance Plan (Annex 1, B2)
will be expanded under the project to include an evaluation of the develop-
mental impact of proposed highway improvements. It will be seen in Annex 17
that average daily traffic on the roads proposed for double bituminous sur-
face treatment exceed the calculated threshold levels, frequently by a large
margin.
Training
5.09     Conventional justification criteria cannot be applied to training
activities. Nonetheless, these activities are an essential cumponent of the
program to improve the quality and cost effectiveness of planning and high-
way maintenance and to reduce reliance on foreign experts. Progress in
achieving training targets, together with future programs are described in
Annex 3.
Technical Assistance
5.10     Approximately 60Z of the technical assistance component of the
project is estimated to be an integral part of the highway maintenance plan-
ning and implementation. As such the cost is included in the evaluation of
the maintenance program. The remaining 401 is variously distributed over
other activities especially training, cost accounting and highway safety
which it is not feasible to evaluate in conventional economic terms.
However, such activities are essential for the efficient functioning of the
DG's and in reducing the accident rate.



- 28 -
Overall Economic Justification
5.11     The road maintenance component of the project, including an esti-
mated 60X of the technical assistance budget, comprises about US$105 million
of the total estimated project cost of US$109 million - nearly 972. The
main items are about US$43 million for periodic asphalt maintenance,
US$29 million for bitumen surface treatment, US$2.7 million for regravel-
ling, US$29 million for resources required for routine maintenance and
US$3.6 million for technical assistance directly serving the maintenance
program. These yield rates of return between 26Z and over 100l and overall
about 471 and have been derived from calculations in Documents B2 and B8 in
the Project File (Annex 1).
Pject Risk
5.12     Satisfactory project implementation, judging by progress now being
made under the Second Highway Maintenance Project, is being given high pri-
ority by Government. The importance of adequate and timely routine and
periodic maintenance is clearly accepted and the proposed level of expendi-
ture is appropriate to the country's needs. The principal risks lie in
bureaucratic delays, especially in personnel recruitment. These could lead
to major periodic maintenance being delayed by about a year but would have
no significant impact on either the achievement of the proposed project
objectives or economic viability.

SULTMATE OF 2MAN
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF
A THIRD HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
Summary of Training - 1978-1988
1978 - 1982
During the previous project approximately 275 employees received
training in both basic skills and in upgrading their skills.
These courses consisted of apprentice mochanics courses, upgrading
skilled mechanics and equipment operator training.
Out of these trainees there were 9 students taking an Apprentlce
Mechanics Petrol course and 6 students taking an Apprentice Diesel
mechanics course. These two courses were carried forward into the
present project and the petrol course students were graduated in
April 1983 and the Diesel students graduated in August 1983.
Approximately 90X of the above students are still employed by the
Directorate.
1983
The first *si mouths of the project were devoted to the following
act..vities:
Furnishin the Training Center at Azaiba, assigning an administrative
staff and making arrangements for the necesary transport.
Training aids on hand were reviewed and cataloged, additionri
training materials were placed on order.
Instructors were interviewed and assigned to the training section
and the Road Traiing Production Unit was re-activated.
A study was made of the training needs of the Directorato a&-A all
mechanical employees were trade tested to determine the lerel of
skills so that correct types of courses could be prepared tc moet
this need.
Syllabus for all courses were prepared and individual candidates
for the various courses were nominated to attend these courses.
At the beginning of June the Tpaining Center was officially opened
and training was started.
Thefirxt group of 10 Petrol students and 9 Diesel students
nominated to take tLe Apprentice .Mechanics course that started in
August were taken from the employees of the Directorate, i-.
Mechanic helpers, and other interested unskilled persons.

With the assigment of additional instructors the scope of the
training program was expanded during this year aid additional
types of training were undertaken.
For the scond series of Apprentice Training courses that started
in 1984, 9 petrol students and 9 diesel trainees vere recruited
from ourside sources with the amurance of a job when they grad-
uated. These students are at least primary school educated,with
soae having secondary school education, thus the caliber of
ftture employees will grow to meet the future needs of the country.
Instructors
DGR - There are now a total of eight mechanical instructors
assigned to the training center. Of the 4 petrol
instructors, 2 are Omani and 2 are expatriate and of the 4
diesel instructors I is Omani and 3 are expatriates.
In addition to the mechanical instructors, the operators
assigned to the Road Production Training Unit have been des-
ignated operator/instructors, I shovel instructor, 2 heavy
truck driver instructors, 3 motor grader instructors and 1

TRINING TARG1S
The overall training program has a threefold purpose, first to
upgrade the skills of the present employees, secondly to provide
a source of new and replacement personnel able to contribute to
the overall task of the Directorate and thirdly, to eventually
replace expatriate employees as Omani employee skills reach the
required levels.
For the purpose of setting trainina; programs and targets we have
broken down the DG employees into two main groups, ie. Work
Centers and Road Maintenance Teams and the Workshops.

ANNEX 6
Page 1 of 7
SULTANATE OF OMAN
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF
A THIRD HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
Technical and Economic Criteria for
Evaluating Highway Prolects
A. Context of Pro;ect Evaluation
1.       Proposed projects of whatever size and location will be studied in
relation to the Sultanate's economic and social needs and these studies will
be applied to investment planning over the entire highway program. In addi-
tion to conventional economic justification on the grounds of transport cost
savings and road maintenance or reconstruction savings, special attention
vill be given to:
(a) the contribution traffic makes to direct foreign exchange
earnings through, for example, transit trade;
(b)  the importance of the traffic to the export of commodities;
(c) transport requirements of specific economic developments;
(d) energy saving; and
Ie) highway safety.
Whilst some of these criteria may not always be readily quantifiable, they
should be clearly described and related to the proposed investment.
2.       Evaluation reports should also describe how the project in question
is related to both the physical and institutional objectives of the Highway
Master Plan. This vould include, as necessary, inter-modal considerations
and reviews of associated investment schedules.
B. General Criteria
Indicators. As far as possible projects' analyses should
concentrate on identifying "lowest total transport cost" (construction +
maintenance + operation) solutions for which economic rates of return, first
year returns and net present values may be calculated. Where alternative
solutions are tested incremental cost:benefit analysis should be undertaken
using the appropriate indicator.



- 48 -
ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 7
Test Rates. Test rates should be established annually with the
assistance of the ministries responsible for economic planning. Prerently,
12Z is used as the test rate but where it is shown that important elements,
although identified, have not been quantified either a relaxation of the
test rate may be appropriate or multi-criteria weighting may be applied. In
these exceptional cases an explanation should be given.
Proiect Horizons. Generally major highway projects should use
20-year horizons although 10 years is frequently acceptable. Small projects,
especially those where significant changes may take place, should be limited
to a 10-year horizon. Primarily the decision on time period used should be
based on an evaluation of type of works, risk and probability.
C. Types of Evaluation Study
3.       Depending on the nature of the proposed project or sub-project the
study methodology will be different. Broadly four types are identified:
(a) large complex investment projects or projects which may have
important and far reaching network effects will be subjected to
major consultancy studies based on unique terms of reference
acceptable to potential financing agencies;
(b) important but relatively straightforward projects, such as
rehabilitation or strengthening of parts of the highway network,
will be subject to feasibility studies undertaken or supervised
by the Ministry of Communications staff according to the
methodology and criteria described in the next section;
(c) relatively small and simple projects which comprise the bulk of
the investment and improvement program will continue, for the
time being to be evaluated according to present procedures
including standard thresholds and traffic warrants; it is
expected, however, that advances in project analysis will be
incorporated as appropriate.
(d) during the course of investment program and sub-project evalu-
ation an analysis will be carried out of the economic and
technical effect of investment works on the cost and resource
needs for maintenance. This information will provide input for
highway maintenance planning.
D. Structure of Feasibility Studies
4.       It is to be particularly emphasized that the feasibility studies
should be the means of identifying suitable projects and specifying optimum
solutions for subsequent detailed design and implementation: they should not
merely be a medium for rubber stamping already taken technical decisions.

5.       The overall layout of the reports on 3(a) and 3(b) should be as
follows:
(a) Introduction and Socio-Economic Context
(b) Engineering, Specifications, Standards and Costs
(c) Traffic Surveys, Growth Rates and Forecasts
(d) Vehicle Operating Costs and Benefits
(e) Description and Display of Costs and Benefits
(f) Calculation of results, Sensitivity Tests and Recommendation.
Appendices

(b) Plan of project on 1:50,C00 scale
(c) Cross sections of proposed road
(d) Deflection slirvey results
(e) Axle load survey results
(f) Speed Survey/journey time survey results
(g) Detailed critical path diagram of recommended solution
6.       In greater detail the sections should include but not be limited to:
A. Introduction and Economic Context
- brief sumnmary of the project including details of any associated
investmencs and administrative arrangements;
- description of project location, terrain and climate;
- popuLation and settlements served by the road;
- economic activity of the area through which the road passes
(i.e. its in ediate area of influence) and a quantified
assessment of its importance to the national economy;
- the link function of the road section (e.g. part of major
north-south link between Muscat and Salalah carrying domestic
traffic such as (x) and transit traffic) and the importance,
quantified as far as possible, to the country; and
- the relationship of the proposed project to the overall highway
plan and strategy.
B. Engineering Specifications, Standards and Costs
(a) These should be given sepaFately for homogeneous sections in the
following format and s.iould alse he given for all alternative
solutions including a special evaluation of the system and cost
of the maintenance alternative.

Details of bridges and major structures should also be given and any special
problems should be described.
(b)   The analysis of pavement deterioration and maintenance and
vehicle operating costs should follow the procedures described
in the Highway Master Plan and 1986-90 Highway Maintenance
Plan. It is proposed to investigate the use eventually of more
sophisticated methodologies such as the World Bank's HDM model
or the Transport and Road Research Laboratory's RTIM II model.
In the same section information of road deterioration and main-
tenance should also be discussed;

(c)  Construction costs should be provided section by section and in
total (also major structures separately where appropriate)
including and excluding tax and calculating the estimated
foreign cost component. This should be done for all alter-
native solutions.
(d) An outline critical path diagram should be provided for each
alternative solution showing the activities and their durations
leading to contract award(s) and mobilization; and also stating
the contract period.
(e) A semi-annual cash flow for construction payments against the
budget, drawn up from past experience on similar project and
from other data.
C. Traffic Surveys, Growth Rates and Forecasts
(a) Results of up-to-date classified vehicle counts differentiating
between Omani and non-Omani vehicles should be given and also
the results of origin and destination surveys where alternative
routes are being examined. Based on these, AADT traffic should
be estimated.
(b) Results of up-to-date axle load surveys differentiating between
directions of travel.
(c) Growth rates for volumes and weight of traffic should be esti-
mated by category of traffic and these should be justified
according to economic and social parameters.
(d) Forecasts of traffic for the analysis period should be given by
number of vehicle type (differentiating between Omani and
non-Omani vehicles) and by number of standard axles p.a.; and
when necessary adjustments should be made for the effect of
special events on traffic generated traffic should be identi-
fied separately.
(e) A description of major conmnodities carried should be given.
D. Vehicle Operating Costs and benefits
(a) The base vehicle operating costs free of tax calculated in
December 1983 should be used suitably updated as free of tax
unit prices change (but also see HDM III and RTIM II calcu-
lations of vehicle operating costs).
(b) Vehicle speeds/journey time tables should be included.

(c) Continue using the existing road condition category measure-
ments as described in the Highway Master Plan and 1986-90
Highway Maintenance Plan.
(d) Vehicle operating cost savings derived by generated traffic
should be multiplied by a factor of 0.5 and those derived by
non-Omani vehicles should be excluded from the analysis.
(e) A special section should be included describing the impact of
the project on fuel consumption and foreign exchange earnings.
(f) Road maintenance savings should be calculated and compared with
vehicle operating cost savings.
(g) Where considered appropriate additional savings such as value of
time and accident prevention may be included but these
inclusions should be explained and justified.
(h) Any other benefits (agricultural exports, greater port effi-
ciency etc.) should be described but care taken to avoid double
counting of the generated traffic.
E. Description and Display of Costs and Benefits
(a) The discount rate or cut-off rate should be specified (12% at
present).
(b) Tables clearly showing discounted and undiscounted costs and
benefits should be given in respect of all alternative solu-
tions examined: an example is given in the Annex. Maintenance
benefits should also be stated as a percentage of benefits
excluding value of time savings.
(c) In cases where value of time (VOT) savings are included (apart
from salaried vehicle crew cost savings) the benefits should be
given with and without VOT benefits.
F.  Calculation of Results. Sensitivity Tests and Recommendations
(a) Economic Rates of Return (ERR), Net Present Value (NPV), First
Year Rates of Return (FYR) and Benefit Cost Ratios (BCR) should
be calculated for each alternative solution investigated and set
out as follows:
Solution A        Solution B
NPV/Cost
BCR
FYR
ERR

ANNEX 6
Page 7 of 7
(b) A description should be given of the major risks (if any) facing
the project - for example, increases in construction cost or
period, declines in traffic growth estimates or failure to
achieve associated projects such as port expansion. Once such
risks are defined the probability of their reaching certain
values should be assessed and, if the probability is considered
sufficiently high, the appropriate values should be applied to
the calculations to assess the impact on them. For example,
Solution A     Solution B
Increase in construction cost due
to encountering hard rock + x            ERR =           ERR =
Decrease in benefits due to over-
estimation of traffic growth
rates - YERR=                                            ERR =
Increase in construction costs
- xZ and decrease in benefits - y2       ERR =           ERR =
(c) Following the calculation of results, examination of risk and
tests for sensitivity a recommendation as to the preferred
solution should be made. Apart from a necessity to meet mini-
,um economic criteria (NPV positive and BCR > 1.0 when dis-
counted at 12X, ERR and FYR > 12X) this recommendation may take
into account a number of other factors and these should be
explained in justification of the decision. For example, a
solution with a low rate of return but virtually riskless
solution may be preferred to a high rate of return high risk
solution, or a solution may be given added importance becaluse of
its links with economic activity in other sectors or because of
foreign exchange earning potential.
(d) Once the final recommendation has been made a detailed criti-
cal path diagram for implementation should be drawn and included
in the feasibility study annexes.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF
A THIRD HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
Accounting Systems and Auditing
A. General
1.       The preparation of the Sultanate's highway Recurrent and Capital
Development Budgets starts in June of each year for the following fiscal
year (January 1 to December 31). However, the Capital Development Budget is
quite strictly based on the Five-Year Investment Plan and, whilst timing of
annual expenditures may be adjusted, the overall Five-Year Program expendi-
ture will change very little.
2.       The Procedure adopted for the review and approval of the two bud-
gets is very similar and includes a large -iumber of checks. The original
Recurrent Budget (which finances the operations of the Directorates General
of Roads (DG) routine and special maintenance activities, technical assist-
ance and training) is prepared by the DG and is broken down into very fine
detail. This original budget is then reviewed by a special committee in the
DC before being passed on to the Ministry of Communications where it passes
through another review committee to test its consistency with the Ministry's
overall program. However, at this stage, the personnel part of the budget
is subject to a special review by the Ministry of Diwan Affairs which is, in
effect, a Cabinet review. Following clearance by the Ministry of Communi-
cations, the budget passes through the Ministry of Finance review process
and is then presented to the Cabinet for final approval, and after this
notice of formal approval is sent to the DG. At any of these stages the
budget may be modified.
3.       The Capital Budget is based on the Five-Year Plan which is prepared
by consultants in cooperation with the relevant departments and ministries.
The Plan as a whole, and the annual Capital Budgets allocations based on it.
pass through similar stages to the Recurrent Budget. However, at the
Ministry of Communications' review stages the General Directorate of Techni-
cal Affairs and Planning plays a significant part. Furthermore, the Plan
and annual allocations are closely examined and have to be agreed by the
Planning Council before Cabinet approval.
B. Budget Monitoring and Control
4.       Expenditure on recurrent budget items up to OR 10,000 may be author-
ized by the DG and his Director of Finance. The U-.der-Secretary of the
Ministry of Communications may authorize expenditures up to OR 50,000 and
the Minister may approve expenditures up to OR 100,000. All expenditures



- 62 -
ANNEX 12
Page 2 of 2
exceeding OR 100,000 have to be approved by the Government Tender Board.
All Capital Budget items have to pass through the Tender Board for approval.
5.       All expenditures have to be clearly checked against the original
budget items and, except in special circumstances, the addition of new items
or cost overruns have to be compensated for by savings in other items.
6.       A monthly account of current budget expenditure is prepared by the
DG Finance Department and there would be no difficulty in maintaining a
separate Project Account for the proposed project. It may, however, be more
appropriate if this account were to be maintained by the Project Accounts
Department of the Ministry of Communications: this would probably be neces-
sary if the project included items from the capital budget. The accounts
are not complex and are clearly supported by the appropriate vouchers and
other documentation and would be acceptable to the Bank.
C. Auditing Procedures
7.       Government auditing procedures are strongly influenced by tradition
and are aimed at achieving correct accounting for funds through discussion
and consensus rather than formal auditing procedures leading to conventional
audit reports.
8.       The Ministry of Communications Finance Department carries out an
annual check on the correctness of all accounts under its control. This
check is also backed up by Ministry of Finance examinations. Any queries
that arise as a result of these checks are resolved directly between the
Ministries of Communication and Finance and the relevant body such as DG,
before the accounts are closed.
9.       In addition, there is a separate independent body of Financial
Inspectors with the status of a Directorate in the Cabinet. This body
carries out spot checks of spending agency accounts and follow-up through
discussion and, if need be, more detailed investigations. No formal audit
report is made outside the Cabinet. However, it should be possible for an
appropriate audit certificate to be prepared relating to the proposed pro-
ject account provided the scope of the account is limited and clearly
defined. The Cabinet Financial Inspectors should be acceptable to the World
Bank as a professionally competent, independent audit body.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF
A THIRD HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
Terms of Reference and Action Plan for a Study
and Preparation of a Highway Safety Program
I. INTRODUCTION
1.       The Government of the Sultanate of Oman is concerned about the level
of accidents on the highway networ-k and intends to carry out a study to
investigate traffic safety and arising out of this study to implement a
safety program, aimed at alleviating the number and severity of traffic
accidents. Directorates General of Roads with the participation of other
concerned organizations will carry out the study, and will arrange for a
program of safety measures to be implemented or further investigation as may
be necessary.
II. OBJECTIVES
2.       The main objectives of the study are as follows:
'i) to establish a system for the regular collection of reliable
data describing accidents on Oman's highway network: these data
will include inter alia: (a) the exact location; (b) description
and classification of accident; (c) road and traffic conditions
of time of accident; and (d) weather conditions at the site and
time of accident;
(ii) to review the extent and standard of road markings and signs on
Oman's highway system together with related highway geometry
characteristics and coefficients of friction of the pavement;
(iii) to prepare a national analysis and categorization of highway
accidents; a computer program for doing this should be developed;
(iv) to make proposals for and implement remedial measures of identi-
fied "black-spots" and arrange to monitor the effects of these
measures; monitoring should take place on a regular basis to
ensure no worsening in the situation takes place;



- 66 -
ANNEX 15
Page 2 of 5
(v) to prepare reports relating, on a quantified basis, the highway
safety situation in Oman with other countries and comparing
respective highway safety policies; and
(vi)  to make recommendations for further actions in the field of
highway safety in Oman.
The program for traffic safety is likely to include proposals for civil
works required to improve safety at specific priority places or sections, a
program for road signs, a ruad marking program, and recommendations for
medical and other accident emergency services, and suggestions for other
related aspects intended to improve traffic safety on the highway network.
III. SCOPE OF STUDY
3.       The study is concerned initially with traffic safety on the main
highway network, but should be extended eventually to the entire highway
network. The study shall include the following phases:
Phase I
(i) collection of data on road accidents by exact location, time and
date, participants, severity, availability of medical help,
weather conditions, detailed road characteristics:  these data
should be processed into a form suitable as input for a selected
accident analysis program;
(ii)  quality of data should be carefully evaluated and where neces-
sary improvements are identified these should be described and
the data collection system redesigned and implemented;
(iii) when data are lacking an inventory should be carried out of the
main highway network giving, inter alia, precise details of
road furniture, markings, surface type and safety barriers; and
(iv)  the road safety situation in different regions of Oman shoulti be
evaluated and compared, identifying "black-spots" and Oman's
overall road safety situation should be compared with that in
other representative countries.
Phase II
(i) general review of road safety and analysis of accident charac-
teristics with estimation of the incidence of different causes;
(ii) detaiLed review and analysis of important "black-spots";



- 67 _
ANNEX 15
Page 3 of 5
(iii) definition of proposed remedial measures at a national level
including matters such as road signs and markings, speed limits,
vehicle testing and, especially, education;
(iv) definition of specific remedial measures to be introduced at
individual "black-spots"; and
(v) development of monitoring systems to evaluate the effects of
remedial measures of national and "black-spot" level.
Note:  Where legal changes are necessary the Ministry of Communications and
associated agencies should take the initiative in stimulating the relevant
legislation.
Phase III - This should include the production of several important
reports which would be:
(i) Inventory of present highway safety situation including relevant
road inventory data;
(ii) Proposals for improved data collection and monitoring of highway
safety measures;
(iii) Detailed "Black-spot" analysis and proposals;
(iv) Safety education;
(v) Proposals for national road signs and marking policy and traffic
control revisions;
(vi) Program costing and implementation schedule; and
(vii) A summary report and proposals for future work.
Monitoring of highway safety and the results of physical, control and educa-
tional policies will continue.
4.       The benefits of the traffic safety proposals which the Ministry of
Communications may recommend, will be qualitatively described and their
distribution amongst different types of road users will be identified.
However, no formal benefit-cost analysis is required for determining the
details of the treatments proposed to improve traffic safety.
5.       The Road Maintenance Directorate of the Ministry of Communications
will coordinate the task force responsible for carrying out this study.
