THIRD HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:        The Sultanate of Oman
Amount:          US$30.0 million equivalent.
Terms:           15 years, including 3 years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Project
Description:   The proposed project covers three years (1986-88) of the
five-year highway maintenance program of the Ministry of
Communications (MOC). It ais  to assist institution
building efforts in MOC and its two Directorates General
of Roads (DG) begun under the first two Bank-assisted
Highway Maintenance Projects on (i) highway
maintenance, (ii) project evaluation, (iii) training
for DG staff, (iv) highway safety, and (v) pavement
management systems.  The loan will provide financing
for: (a) construction of highway maintenance
workshops, work centers and training center extension;
(b) procurement of pavement and traffic data collection
equipment; (c) bituminous surface treatment; and
(d) consultancy services. Benefits lie primarily in
the institution building in MOC and DG for highway
maintenance, project evaluation and pavement management,
and a subsequent reduction in reliance on expatriate
technical assistance. The project would lead to a
reduction in highway traffic accidents, and to savings
in vehicle operating costs and road maintenance costs.
There are no unusual risks.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND
DEVELOPMENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE SULTANATE OF OMAN FOR A THIRD HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Sultanate of Oman for the equivalent of US$30.0 million to help finance
a Third Highway Maintenance Project. The loan would have a term of fifteen
years, including three years of grace at the standard variable interest rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY1'
2.       A report entitled "Oman - Recent Economic Developments and
Prospects", (5380-ON) was distributed to the Executive Directors in September
1985. Its findings are reflected in the following paragraphs.
3.       Oman is an oil-exporting country located southeast of Saudi Arabia
and adjacent to the United Arab Emirates in the Arabian Peninsula. This could
lead one into placing Oman in the same category as its wealthy neighbors, such
as the United Arab Emirates or Kuwait, and thus concluding that modernization
and development are easily within its grasp or financial capacity. The
country's more visible signs of wealth and progress, however, tend to obscure
the important fact that the history of modern Oman did not begin until barely
a decade ago. Prior to 1970, Oman was closed to the outside world under the
rule of a Sultan who resisted all modernizing influences and attempted to keep
Oman a traditional state. Subsistence agriculture, artisanal fishing and
minor handicraft activities were basically the way of life in the country. At
the same time, the southern province of Dhofar was subjected to a long and
costly guerrilla warfare that continued until 1975.
Past Economic Developments
4.       In 1967, oil production started and with it came rising incomes and
the possibility of establishing a modern economy. Rapid economic development,
however, was initiated only in 1970 when Sultan Qaboos came to power,
resulting in a remarkable transformation of the economy. In the short span of
14 years, economic infrastructure has been built up from a very rudimentary
stage and impressive gains have been made in education, health and housing.
Rapid increases in personal incomes and in the expansion of public services
have improved substantially the living conditions of the population,
particularly those in the urban centers. In 1970, less than one thousand
children were in school, there was only one small hospital, hardly any
1/ Substantially the same as Part I of the President's Report (No. P-3928-OM,
dated January 22, 1985) for the Second Telecommunications Project, which
was approved by the Executive Directors on April 9, 1985.



- 2 -
electricity and piped water, and only 10 kilometers of asphalt roads in a
country with an area of some 300,000 square kilometers and about a million
people. Now the schools have almost 170,000 pupils, there are over 2,100
hospital beds and more than 3,200 kilometers of asphalted roads. Urban areas
are almost fully supplied with electricity and running water and a growing
number of rural areas are gaining access to these services.
5.       Nevertheless, the high average per capita income of over $6,000
estimated for 1983 gives an exaggerated impression of the country's real
wealth for three reasons. First, incomes are highly skewed in favor of the
urban areas, which are largely inhabited by foreigners (two-thirds of the
non-agricultural labor force is estimated to be expatriate). Second, vital
infrastructure (human and physical) is still lacking compared with countries
of a much lower average income, but a longer history of economic
modernization. Third, the productive base of the economy is still very
narrow, depending overwhelmingly on oil.
6.       Diversification efforts have been hampered by the scarcity of skilled
Omani manpower, a major factor behind the lack of project preparation,
evaluation and implementation capacity. To alleviate this constraint, the
Government has pursued a liberal policy towards the import of expatriate
labor, while at the same time emphasizing education and training programs for
Omani nationals. While in the short and medium term it would be impossible to
carry out rapid economic development without expatriate labor, the Government
realizes that the presence of a large number of expatriate workers also has
its costs, such as the outflow of foreign exchange through worker remittances
(almost 20 percent of oil revenues), the physical infrastructure needed to
support these workers, their increased consumption of scarce resources, e.g.,
water, and their socio-cultural impact.
7.       The rapid growth of the economy in the 1970s was stirmlated primarily
by high levels of government expenditures fueled by rising oil revenues. The
period 1974-76 witnessed a sharp increase in such expenditures from a very low
base. After a period of relatively slower growth due to strains on physical
and financial resources, government spending was stepped up again in 1979-83
as oil revenues increased, raising the share of public administration and
defense to nearly one-third of gross domestic product (GDP). Nevertheless,
the budget recorded surpluses averaging 12 percent of gross domestic product
during 1979-81, which were utilized largely to build up a General Reserve
Fund. The decline in oil prices changed the fiscal situation considerably;
the budget balance deteriorated sharply in 1982 and 1983 resulting in a small
deficit (2 percent of GDP) in the latter year.
8.       With the gradual elimination of physical bottlenecks and the adoption
of liberal labor immigration policies, the large government outlays together
with induced private sector investments resulted in a growth of non-oil
economic activity at an average rate of close to 10 percent per annum so that
it now accounts for about half of total GDP. Manufacturing, in particular,
expanded briskly as new projects came on stream but still accounted for only
about two percent of total GDP in 1983. The first full year of production of
Oman's first oil refinery, as well as the coming on stream of a copper smelter
and a major cement plant, have contributed to this effort.



9.       In spite of the rapid development of the non-oil economy, about
50 percent of Oman's GDP is produced by the petroleum sector. Crude oil
exports dominate Oman's balance of payments, accounting for over 99 percent of
the country's exports. They were mainly responsible for the large surpluses
recorded in the balance of payments during the years 1979-82. In 1983, a
sharp decline in oil prices and resulting decline in oil revenues, together
with a continued high growth of imports of goods and services and large
increases in workers" remittances being sent abroad, caused Oman's current
account balance to deteriorate, showing a deficit for the first time in the
past five years compared with surpluses at a record level of over $1 billion
in 1980 and 1981.
10.      Oil will maintain its dominant position in the medium term even
though Oman has set the production ceiling at about the current output level
of about 413,000 barrels per day, in order to conserve the long-term output of
oil reserves. Higher production, however, might prove necessary if oil prices
remain stagnated and high growth in government expenditures and workers'
remittances remain unabated. Large amounts are being invested to expand
exploration activity, and identified reserves have risen to 3 billion barrels,
sufficient to maintain the present production level for another twenty years.
Oman also has considerable natural gas reserves; a substantial proportion of
these, however, will be conserved for oil field injection and power
generation, leaving unallocated proven reserves below the threshold needed for
competitive gas exports.
Development Strategy and Economic Prospects
11.      Since known oil resources are expected to be depleted a generation
from now, the long-term prospects of the Omani economy depend on the country's
capacity to further diversify its productive base. Almost half of the value
of non-oil production has hitherto originated from construction, public
administration and defense. However, unlike several of its neighbors in the
Gulf, Oman has some potential for exploitation of natural resources other than
oil. Long-established agricultural settlements are scattered throughout the
country in areas where sufficient water is available, and relatively large
increases from the present low crop yields appear feasible through
introduction of modern production techniques and improved quality of inputs.
There is good potential for coastal fisheries and sufficient deposits of some
minerals, such as copper and chromite, have been found to justify further
exploration. The productive base could also be widened through development of
selected import substitution industries for non-durable consumer goods and
downstream copper products. The Government's objective is to encourage the
private sector to assume a lead role in non-oil activities.
12.      Since the volume of oil production is unlikely to increase
substantially, oil export earnings are projected to grow from $3.9 billion in
1983 to about $5.4 billion in 1988. These earnings would be supplemented
marginally by copper and agricultural exports. This modest increase in
exports obviously will affect growth of government revenues, the overall
savings performance of the economy, and the balance of payments. In
particular, continued high growth in government recurrent expenditures and
workers' remittances, while maintaining reasonably high investment level,
would soon lead to rapidly increasing budget and balance of payments deficits
difficult to finance in the longer term. In view of the Government's



- 4 -
past record of prudent management, it is likely to take the necessary measures
to avoid these risks even at the price of a substantially lower growth of
non-oil GDP than that achieved over the last years.
13.      To facilitate this adjustment, further efforts will have to be made
to mobilize domestic resources and develop demand management tools. Although
government revenues from non-oil sources have satisfactorily increased in
recent years, several possible options to increase their share remain open.
For instance, a moderate indirect tax on selected luxury goods could yield
additional revenue and at the same time slow down consumption of such goods.
A tax on domestic sales of petroleum products, as well as other indirect
taxes, could be introduced. A reassessment of the present income tax
structure, improvement of tax administration, and gradual reintroduction of
property taxes are among other possible measures to augment non-oil revenues.
There is also a need for reconsideration of the rates charged on publicly
provided services, particularly electricity tariffs, where revenues fall short
of costs. These measures should be combined with further restrictive measures
to curb the rapid growth of public recurrent expenditures and private
consumption, and with a thorough re-evaluation of the country's development
priorities and investment program, in particular those items which had not
been specified earlier in the current Plan that may compete for funds needed
for the high priority projects.
14.      The concept of domestic resource mobilization would apply also to
Oman's domestic manpower. The major efforts to upgrade the skills of domestic
labor and to increase participation rates will need to be maintained in order
to replace the large expatriate population. Such efforts would enable the
country, in the medium term, to contain the fairly large and rapidly
increasing share of revenues that it spends on expatriate labor.
External Assistance and Foreign Debt
15.      Oman's external public debt amounted to about $1.1 billion at the end
of 1983; this corresponds to little more than 14 percent of GDP or 27 percent
of total net foreign exchange reserves (including the General Reserve Fund).
The debt service ratio had declined rapidly over the last years from
9.3 percent in 1978 to 3.4 percent in 1983. The present foreign debt burden,
thus, is very small. The trend, however, is towards an increasing debt
burden; total foreign debt outstanding has doubled since 1981. and this upward
move is likely to continue over the next years.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN OMAN -'
16.      Bank lending to Oman began in 1974. As of March 31, 1985, seven
loans totalling $76.4 million (net of cancellations) had been made; of this,
1/ Substantially the same as Part II of the President's Report
(No. P-3928-OM, dated January 22, 1985, for the Second Telecommunications
Project, which was approved by the Executive Directors on April 9, 1985.



about $65.0 million is now held by the Bank. A summary statement of Bank
loans to Oman as of March 31, 1985 is provided in Annex II.
17.      Bank loans to Oman have been principally directed towards the
provision of technical assistance in crucial areas, the relief of national
manpower constraints, and the development of appropriate policies and
investment strategies in priority sectors. A Technical Assistance Project
(Loan 985-OM) helped Oman to establish the Development Council, the
Government's key institution for economic management and planning.  Two
Education Projects are helping to increase national educational opportunities
and improve standards. Highway Maintenance and the First TelecommLunications
Projects have helped establish and develop Oman's institutional capacity to
manage two of its more important infrastructure programs effectively. These
two sectors are viewed by the Government as essential to integrate the various
parts of the country.
18.      Projects under implementation consist of operations in the
telecommunications, highway maintenance and education sectors. No major
problems have been encountered and implementation is proceeding smoothly. The
disbursement rate for Bank loans to Oman as of June 1985 is, at about
85 percent of appraisal estimates, well above those for other countries in the
region.
19. -   The Bank's lending has included a Second Education Project (Loan
2419-OM), a Telecomimmications II Project, the presently proposed Third
Highway Maintenance Project, and a proposed project in the health sector. A
health project is particularly crucial in Oman, where the prevailing life
expectancy is only 50 years.
20.      In addition to lending, technical cooperation between the Bank and
Oman will continue to be an important feature of Bank involvement. In this
context, the Bank has provided assistance to the Ministry of Social Affairs
and Labor towards the establishment of a Manpower Planning Unit. Bank
assistance in the implementation of a manpower planning program through 1985
is continuing satisfactorily. The Manpower Planning Unit has become the
Manpower Planning Department as of June 1, 1983. The Bank will continue
technical support to this Department, focussing on the improvement of the data
base and the execution of special sector studies. In addition, the Bank, upon
request of the Government, has assessed the manpower implications of the
Second Five-Year Development Plan and advised on the formulation and
implementation of a minimum wage policy and its economic and social
implications. It has also assessed the needs for rural training and advised
on a strategy for broadening the scope of vocational training in the
agriculture, fisheries and rural handicrafts subsectors. The Government has
recently requested assistance in the area of national account compilation.
21.      To date, IFC has made only one investment in Oman-a $2 million
equity participation in the Oman Development Bank. IFC has at present no
project pipeline in Oman but will continue to explore opportunities for
further investment.

PAaT III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
22.      Until 1970, there was no modern transport system in Oman.  The road
network consisted of 10 km of paved roads and an undetermined lengtlh of
earthen tracks; there was only limited water and air traffic.  In the 1970s,
the transport system was developed actively and now includes an extensive and
growing road network, two modern deep-water ports and one oil port, and an
iuternational airport and several civ.lian and military airfields.  The
highway subsector has dominated transportation and will continue to be the
main means of transport in the future.
Planning, Policy and Coordination
23.      Transport planning and administration, except for roads in the
capital area, are under the direction of the Ministry of Communications (MOC)
through two Directorates General of Roads (DO), one in the north and another
in the south. The Development Council is responsible for setting and
monitoring overall sectoral objectives and priorities. The second Five-Year
(1986-90) Master Plan for highways was prepared by Government authorities with
assistance from the consultants Dar Al-Handasah (Shair and Partners) - Lebanon
and U.K.. Foreign technical assistance in the trans-ort sector will continue
to be needed until a sufficient number of trained and experienced Omani
nationals are available. The national road network is under the jurisdiction
of the HOC with maintenance the responsibility of the DG. Other special
purpose roads and tracks are 'under the jurisdiction of the Ministries of
Interior and of Defense, and of Petroleum Development Oman (PDO). PDO also is
responsible for pipelines and certain port operations.
Sector Obiectives
24.      The Government's intention in the next five-year (1986-90) plan is to
continue to improve the highway system and to develop the Omani human
resources needed to run the system without the assistance of expatriates. At
the same time, the Government wishes to protect its existing investments by
establishing a modern highway maintenance system. The proposed Third Highway
Maintenance Project would assist the Government in this objective.
Highway Subsector
2.5.     Network and Organization.  The national road network consists of
3,267 km of paved roads, 1,585 km of gravel roads and 8,163 km of maintained
earth roads.  The network meets the primary needs of all regions of Oman, and
provides access to major agricultural areas and -opulation centers. The
critical need now is to continue to expand Oman's capacity to carry out
effective highway maintenance. There is also still a need for major
investments in highway facilities in the urban areas, especially the Capital
Area, where road traffic has increased more rapidly than expected; the road
system in the Capital Area is, however, not under the jurisdiction of MOC and
will not be addressed in this project.
26.      The size of Oman and the long distances to other countries in the
region, combined with the relatively low population densities, pose challenges
in establishing an economically efficient transport system that must also meet
social needs. During the past ten years considerable progress has been made



in meeting these challenges and a sound basic infrastructure framework to
serve domestic and international traffic has been developed. In the urban
regions, especially the Capital Area, the growth of road traffic has been such
that, despite a large highway development program, there is still a need for
major investments in highway facilities. In the rural areas, more and more
communities are being connected to the main network by improved tracks with
consequent reductions in operating and maintenance costs of vehicles.
27.      In the period 1978-83, the vehicle fleet increased about 22 percent
per annum (p-a.). Excluding motorcycles and military vehicles, the vehicle
fleet comprised about 176,500 vehicles in 1983, of which about 16 percent were
medium/heavy conmrcial and Government vehicles. It is expected that future
overall traffic growth will be in excess of 10 percent p.a. for both passenger
and commercial traffic.  It should be noted that traffic statistics in Oman
are not good; under the proposed project, traffic study and forecasting
methods would be improved.
28.      Highway Investment and Maintenance.  Planning and control of highway
investment is the responsibility of MOC, with substantial help from
consultants. The proposed 1986-90 Master Plan is in the early planning
stages, but it is expected that annual investment expenditures (excluding
those for the Capital Area) will average $200 million, allocated mainly to
road improvements. Planning and control of highway maintenance is under MC's
two directorates. The proposed routine and periodic maintenance program for
1986-90 indicates a budget of about $58 million p.a., or about $4,500/km p.a.,
which is adequate. The Government accrues revenue from direct (license and
vehicle registration fees, import duties) and indirect (the rent element in
fuel prices) road user fees. These are currently more than adequate to cover
routine maintenance and that part of the investment budget allocated to
periodic maintenance of asphalt roads.
29.      Highway Maintenance.  Approximately 70 percent of the basic highway
infrastructure has been established. The current thrust of highway strategy
is directed toward both routine and periodic maintenance and strengthening and
upgrading the existing network. The combined effects of increasing traffic,
which-is predicted to grow at 1 1/2 - 2 times the rate of growth of GDP,
expanding intra-regional trade, and more frequent use of larger road vehicles
will intensify the need for road strengthening and upgrading. It is expected
that approximately 22 percent of the current road system will require periodic
maintenance and minor improvements in the 1986-90 period.
30.      The organization of the DGs, which are responsible for maintenance,
is sound and appropriate for their responsibilities; however, the DGs are
constrained by staff shortages, particularly at the sub-professional and
professional levels. This lack of staff has been addressed with some success
under the previous highways projects. However, there are still insufficient
numbers of Omanis qualified to fill senior professional and sub-professional
positions. These still depend on the employment of consultants and
recruitment of expatriates. The proposed project would continue to address
this issue through continued technical assistance and an extended training
program.
31.      Highway Safety.  An estimated 12,000 road accidents take place each
year, of which about 300 are fatal. The accident rate is about twice the rate
in the US and UK, with road fatalities about three times higher. Although it



- 8 -
is expected that with the improvements made under the 1986-90 highway program
the incidence of road accidents would decrease, road safety remains a serious
problem, and a program to institute adequate data collection and analysis
systems should be implemented as a first step in developing sound highway
safety policies (para. 41).
The Ports, Civil Aviation and Railway Subsectors
32.      Oman has a number of natural harbors.  The completion of Port Qaboos
in 1975, close to Muscat, provided the country with a modern deep-water port
with a capacity of 1.5 million tons of cargo every year. A nearby oil port,
Fahal, serves as the export terminus for Oman's oil. Near the southern town
of Salalah at Raysut, port expansion was co"pleted toward the end of 1980 to
handle one million tons a year. There are also several natural coastal
harbors for dhow traffic. Regular domestic civil air services operate between
Muscat and Salalah and other regional centers. Seeb International Airport,
32 km west of Muscat, opened in late 1972 and can handle the largest
commercial airplanes. There are no railways in Oman, although a study has
recently been undertaken for the Gulf Cooperation Council to investigate the
economic viability of building a railway from Iraq to Oman for mineral
traffic.
Bank Involvement in the Transport Sector
33.      The proposed project would be the fourth in the transport sector.
Bank involvement in the transport sector began in March 1974, when the Board
approved a $2.7 million loan for technical assistance for agriculture and
transport (Loan 985-ON). Under the loan, $1.2 million of which went to the
highway sector, consultants prepared Oman's first five-year highway
maintenance program. Three years of this five-year program formed the basis
for the Bank's second loan in the transport sector, First Highway Maintenance
Project (Loan 1441-OM, approved in May 1977), for $15 million. The loan
covered procurement of highway maintenance equipment and spare parts,
construction of workshops and a training center, a training program for
highway maintenance management, operations and training. The $15 miilion
Second Highway Maintenance Project (Loan 2084-O), approved in March 1982,
covers a three-year segment of the second five-year highway maintenance
program and is expected to be completed in December 1985. It comprises a
continuation of highway routine and periodic maintenance, construction and/or
modification of highway maintenance centers, maintenance equipment and spare
parts, technical assistance and training. Although experiencing some early
delays, the projects have made significant progress in meeting their
objectives, leading to advances in the level and quality of highway
maintenance and increased numbers of skilled and experienced Omani staff.
34.      The Bank's strategy in the transport sector is to continue to assist
the Government in developing its road maintenance capabilities and in
institution-building through technical assistance and training. Of particular
importance is the training of Omani staff to gradually replace the large
number of expatriate; in the transport sector. The continuation of technical
assistance and training, in parallel with development of a periodic pavement
strengthening program, is in accord with the Bank's strategy of promoting the
development of the Borrower's own capabilities.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
35.      The proposed proiect was prepared by the Government with assistance
from consultants, initially finaced under the First Highway Maintenance
Project (Loan 1441-ON) in 1978. The project was appraised in December 1984,
and negotiations were held in Washington, D.C., from August 15 to
August 21, 1985. The Omani delegation was headed by Mr. Tariq Bin Mohamed Bin
Amin Al-Mantheri, Director General of Roads, Ministry of Communications. A
staff appraisal report entitled "Sultanate of Oman - A Third Highway
Maintenance Project"' (No. 5493-ON), dated September 9, 1985, is being
distributed separately to the Executive Directors. The main features of the
loan and project are described in the Loan and Project Summary and in Annex
III. A map of the project area is attached.
Proiect Obiectives
36.      The proposed project would be a continuation of the ongoing Second
Highway Maintenance Project (Loan 2084-OM), which is scheduled for completion
in December 1985, and would have as its overall objective the furtherance of a
sustainable system of highway maintenance, through appropriate management
techniques, sufficient local resources of personnel and institutional
capability. This would be achieved through:
(a) strengthening of project preparation, planning and implementation
procedures, including the development of guidelines for project and
program economic evaluation and the introduction of a pavement
mmnagement system;
(b) promoting and sustaining effective routine and periodic highway
maintenance through the development of support infrastructure
(highway workshops, work centers, pavement and traffic data
collection equipment) and sound work programs assisted by Bank
participation in selection of priority works;
(c) training local personnel in the skills needed to undertake planning,
implementation and monitoring tasks for Oman's highway maintenance,
investment and highway safety programs; and
(d) development of an effective program for the control and reduction of
highway accidents.
Proiect Description
37.      The project would assist in the implementation of the first three
years (1986-88) of the DG's five-year (1986-90) highway maintenance program,
which was developed under Loan 2084-OM. It would consist of: (i) periodic
and routine maintenance, minor improvement and strengthening of highways;
(ii) bituminous surface treatment; (iii) equipment and spare parts for
highway maintenance, workshops, pavement data collection and processing, and



- 10 -
highway safety; (iv) construction of workshops, highway maintenance centers
and training center extension; and (v) technical assistance to HOC and DG.
The project features are elaborated in subsequent paragraphs.
38.      Periodic Maintenance and Minor Improvements.  Under the proposed
project, about 620 km of the paved highway network would require asphaltic
overlays. Of the 9,748 km of unpaved roads, approximately BOG km of heavily
used unpaved roads would be maintained thrcugh bituminous sarface treatment
and about 1,500 km through gravel replenishment. Periodic maintenance for
paved and gravel roads would be planned and supervised by consultants
appointed under the project. During appraisal, road sections for asphaltic
overlays were identified; those sections have been determined to yield an
economic return of at least 12 percent for each highway or highway section, on
the basis of technical and economic evaluations. During negotiations
agreement was reached that the Borrower would prepare, in consultation with
the Bank, guidelines for determining the highways .and highway sections to be
maintained. These guidelines would be finalized before September 30, 1986.
It was furthermore agreed that highway programs for future maintenance would
be prepared and implemented according to these guidelines. During
negotiations agreement was also reached that the Borrower would continue to
provide funds to ensure that the highway improvement and maintenance plans
developed in accordance with the above-mentioned guidelines are carried out.
39.      Equipment and Spare Parts.  Lists of equipment and spare parts to be
procured under this component for use in highway maintenance and data
collection and processing were provisionally identified during negotiations.
Equipment and materials for highway safety and training also would be procured
under this component.
40.      Construction.  Under this component, two new workshops would be
constructed at Ibra and Haima, which would complete the six-workshop
construction program envisaged under the First Highway Maintenance Project,
four of which were constructed under that project. Also included in this
component is the DG's program for construction of 24 highway maintenance work
centers; 8 are expected to be completed each year from 1986 to 1988. In
addition, an expansion of the training center at Azaiba will provide extra
classrooms and offices needed for expanding the training program.
41.      Technical Assistance to MOC and DC.  The proposed project would
continue the institution-building work that began under the First Highway
Maintenance Project, and continued under the Second Highway Maintenance
Project. Draft terms of reference for technical assistance and for consultant
services were reviewed during negotiations and include: (i) highway
maintenance management and operations (132 staff-months); (ii) pavement
management (24 staff-months); (iii) cost accounting (12 staff-months); (iv)
training for highway maintenance supervisors, operators and mechanics (132
staff-months); (v) highway safety (24 staff-months); and (vi) administrative,
planning and operations support, including the collection and processing of
pavement and traffic data (132 staff-months). The project also provides for
60 staff-months of in-line services of individual specialists and technicians
within the DG. Specific job titles, descriptions and staff-months are in
accordance with a Training Plan of Action prepared by the consultants under
the Second Highway Maintenance Project and adopted by the DG. During



- 11 -
negotiations, it was agreed that the Borrower would employ qualified and
experienced consultants, to continue to provide technical assistance mainly on
highway maintenance, management and safety aspects of the project under terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
Project Implementation
r
42.      MOC would have overall responsibility for project implementation,
including construction and supervision of periodic maintenance of asphalt
overlays, workshops, work centers, training center extension and supervision
of procurement of all the project's equipment and spare parts. DG, under MOC
and with the assistance of consultants, would have direct responsibility for
the execution and implementation of the highway maintenance, operations and
training programs, including the procurement of equipment and spare parts for
workshops and centers, training, pavement data collection and highway safety.
It was agreed during negotiations that the Government would implement the
project in accordance with an implementation schedule acceptable to the Bank.
The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1989.
Training
43.      Training is a critical activity to be undertaken under the project as
it is crucial to upgrading the level of maintenance carried out by DG, and
fostering a gradual replacement of expatriates at all levels. Training
results have been encouraging and the numbers of trainees is increasing
satisfactorily - 105 attended courses in 1983, 291 in 1984 and 616 are planned
for 1985. The proposed project would build upon the progress made in training
under the First and Second Highway Maintenance Projects. The 1986-1988
training program aims to provide instructional courses for 310, 390 and 450
trainees respectively. Training would be addressed especially to maintenance
supervisors, equipment operators, drivers and mechanics. Middle and
high-level staff and Omani instructors would also receive training. During
negotiations, it was agreed that the Government would continue a comprehensive
training program satisfactory to the Bank, make available sufficient numbers
of experienced personnel to be trained as instructors, recruit sufficient
manpower to be trained for maintenance operations, and continue to maintain a
permanent training section within the DG.
Accounting and Auditing
44.      The Government accounting and auditing systems are acceptable and
adequate.  In addition to audits that are carried out by some agencies and the
Ministry of Finance, there is an independent Financial Inspector Directorate
of the Cabinet Office that audits selected accounts. During negotiations, it
was agreed that (i) a separate project account would be maintained in
accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied, by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and (ii) a certified copy of the
audit report by said auditors would be prepared and submitted to the Bank not
later than six months after the end of each fiscal year.
Proiect Cost and Financing
45.     A detailed breakdown of the cost of the project is given in the Loan
and Project Summary. The total cost of the three-year project, including
recurrent costs, is about $193 million, of which about $110 million would be



- 12 -
in foreign exchange. The proposed loan of $30.0 million, therefore,
represents about 15 percent of total project costs, and about 27 percent of
foreign exchange costs. The total cost of the Government's entire five-year
program is about $295 million. Price contingencies were calculated using
domestic escalation rates of 4 percent for 1984, 7 percent for 1985, and 8
percent for 1986-90, and foreign escalation rates of -2.8 percent for 1',84, 5
percent for 1985, 7.5 percent for 1986, and 8 percent for 1987-90. The Bank
loan would be made to the Government, which would finance the additional
foreign costs of the five-year program and all local costs. The recurrent
costs of periodic maintenance operations (e.g., salaries, wages, fuels) are
not eligible for financing under the proceeds of the loan and would be met
from Government funds.
Special Account
46.      The Borrower has agreed to open and maintain a Special Account of
$1 million in the Central Bank of Oman. Funds from this revolving fund would
be used for the construction and equipping of workshops and centers,
procurement of equipment and materials for data collection and highway safety,
expansioa of and equipment for the Azaiba training center, and for
training/technical assistance related to institution-building for MOC and DG.
Procurement and Disbursement
47.      Bank-Financed Components. The equipment for pavement data collection
and highway safety is varied and specialized, with maximum size of individual
contracts being under $50,000 and in aggregate value not exceeding $370,000.
Depending on the degree of, specialization, most of this equipment will be
procured through limited international bidding; the remainder, which will be
higbly specialized or proprietary in nature, will be procured through
international shopping, all in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for
Procurement.
48.      Contracts for bituminous surface treatment will be awarded after
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's
"Guidelines for Procurement". Works would be packaged to make the contracts
attractive to larger contractors.
49.      Contracts for the construction of highway maintenance workshops and
work centers and the training center extension will be awarded after local
competitive bidding (LCB) under procedures satisfactory to the Bank.  The
simple nature of construction, the scope of work and the proposed programme of
construction render LCB appropriate since (i) ample competition is assured
through the participation of numerous local and foreign contractors already
working in Oman; other interested foreign firms may also participate in the
bidding; and (ii) the work sites are widely scattered geographically which
restricts packaging.
5C.      All procurement documentation for the pavement data collection and
safety equipment and for the workshops, work centers and training center
extension contracts will be reviewed by the Bank before being issued. All
building contracts, together with bidding analysis, will be subject to Bank
review prior to contract award. The specialized equipment contracts will be
subject to selective post review.

52.      Non Bank-Financed Components.  The periodic maintenance program
contracts would be procured under ICB procedures which allow the many local
and foreign contractors already working in Oman to participate; other
interested foreign firms are also allowed to bid and, if successful, must
register in Oman before they are awarded the contract. For other maintenance



- 14 -
contracts such as regravelling, the bid invitations will be advertised
regionally. Equipment procurement will follow procedures very similar to
international competitive bidding with international advertising.
53.      The loan would be disbursed against:  Ca)  95 percent of the total
costs of pavement data collection and highway safety equipment; (b) 80
percent of the total costs of highway workshops, which represents the
estimated foreign exchange component of this item; (c) 60 percent of the
total costs of bituminous surface treatment, which represents the foreign
exchange component of this item; (d) 50 percent of the total costs of highway
work centers and training center extension, which represents the estimated
foreign exchange component of this item; and (e) 75 percent of the total
costs of the consultants undertaking maintenance management/training and
general technical assistance and of individual technicians serving directly on
DG staff.
Project Benefits and Justification
54.      The proposed project is necessary to consolidate and strengthen the
institution building achieved under the first and second projects. Its
economic benefits would accrue directly to (i) the country, which would
preserve its road investment and ultimately reduce its maintenance costs as
Omani nationals are trained to replace expatriates; (ii) the trucking industry
through reduced vehicle operating costs, which would be passed on to consumers
because of the competition that prevails in the trucking industry; and (iii) a
wide range of other highway users. The project would lead also to
improvements in traffic safety through highway improvements, vehicle controls
and road user education. The project is expected to yield an overall economic
rate of return of about 47 percent.
55.      Judging by progress now being made under the Second Highway
Maintenance Project, satisfactory project implementation is given high
priority by the Government. The importance of adequate and timely routine and
periodic maintenance is clearly accepted and the proposed level of expenditure
is appropriate to Oman's needs. The principal risks lie in the need to adopt
more efficient procedures to prevent bureaucratic delays, especially in
personnel recruitment. At worst, if larger investments under the proposed
project on major periodic maintenance are delayed by a year, it should not
significantly hamper the achievement of either economic benefits or
institutional objectives.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
56.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.

DEFINMONS OF SOCIAL INDICOTORS
Notes Although the data .rc dawn from sources gersmily judged the most authoritauive nd reliable. it should also be noted that thcy may not be internationally
comparable because of the lbck or standardized definitions and concepts uscd by different countrics in collecting the data. Th data are, nonetheles uefut to
describe orders or magnitude. indicate treads. and charteize certain major differences between countries.
Thm refenne groups ae (1) the s-n country group of the subject country and (Z) a country group with soewhaLt higher avrage income thin the country
group of the subject country (except for "High Income Oil Exporters" group where 'Middle Income North Africa ad Middlc East" is chosen bccmuse of strongr
socio-cultural affinitics). In the referecce group data the avrage are population weighted arithmetic mc  for each indicator and shown only whea majority
of the countries in n group has data for that indicalor. Since the coverag of countries mong the indicators dpends on the availability of data and is not uniform.
caution must be exercised in relating averages of one indicator to another. These avere are only ueful in comnparng the value of one indicator at a time among
the country and reference groups.
