REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE BANK FOR AGRICULTURE AND FOOD INDUSTRY OF ROMANIA, WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF ROMANIA, FOR THE
RASOVA-VEDEROASA IRRIGATION AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry of Romania, with the guarantee
of the Socialist Republic of Romania, for the equivalent of US$60 million,
to help finance an irrigation and agricultural development project. The loan
would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at
8-1/2 percent per annum. BAFI would relend US$20.5 million equivalent of the
proceeds of the loan to cooperatives and State Farms, at an average interest
rate of no less than 3 percent per annum, for terms of up to 25 years includ-
ing up to 5 years of grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic memorandum for Romania (818a-RO), was circulated
to the Executive Directors on December 29, 1975. Country social and economic
data are given in Annex I.
3.        Since the founding in 1947 of the People's Republic of Romania,
which in 1965 was reconstituted as the Socialist Republic of Romania, eco-
nomic management has been organized along socialist principles which have in-
cluded state and cooperative ownership of almost all productive resources, and
the absence of private enterprise. Economic activity is directed by means of
obligatory development: planning, coordinated by the central authorities. Pro-
ductive enterprises operate within the framework of the development plan which
defines the scope of their activity, the outlines of their production and in-
vestment goals and their targets for operating efficiency. The plan is
elaborated within a five-year time frame, each year having a separate Annual
Plan. The country has just begun its Five-Year Plan for 1976-80.
4.        The technical and functional Ministries are the State's chief agents
for the administration of economic activity. 'they are assisted by subordinate
units known as Centra]s, which coordinate and supervise activities within a com-
mon branch or industry without being directly engaged in production. Enterprises

subordinate to the Centrals are responsible for production which is controlled
through a system of physical production targets. Production enterprises gen-
erally are not authorized to engage directly in foreign trade and rely on spe-
cialized foreign trade enterprises for this purpose. In agriculture, large
State farms and cooperatives are the predominant units of production.
5.        Economic development is of paramount concern to the Romanian Gov-
ernment. Rapid industrialization is a major objective with priority being
given to heavy industry including steel, machine tools and chemicals. To
achieve their growth objectives, the Romanian authorities have made consid-
erable efforts to mobilize domestic resources for development and to maintain
a high rate of capital formation. In the Five-Year Plan just completed, plan-
ned and actual investment rates of around 30 percent of GNP were the norm. As
a consequence, consumption has been restrained, and the development of the
consumer goods industry has been less strongly emphasized than that of heavy
industry. In 1974, heavy industry (led by machine tools, chemicals and
ferrous metallurgy) accounted for about 58 percent of industrial production.
6.        As a result of this strategy, a marked change has been achieved in
the structure of Romania's economy. Rapid industrial growth, which over the
last decade has averaged more than 13 percent per annum, has expanded the
share of the labor force employed in industry (including power and construc-
tion) from about 14 percent in 1950 to 38 percent in 1974. During the same
period, the share of labor force engaged in agriculture declined from 74 per-
cent to around 40 percent; and while agricultural output almost tripled, its
share in GNP amounted to only 16 percent in 1974.
7.        Notwithstanding the emphasis on industrialization, more than half
of the population (about 57 percent in 1974) still lives in rural areas and
agriculture remains a key sector of the economy. Apart from supplying food,
industrial inputs and the residual labor increment for industrial growth
(which requires an expansion in agricultural productivity), the sector also
supplies about 27 percent of the nation's convertible foreign exchange
earnings. These earnings, which are largely used to buy imported inputs for
industry, have often been jeopardized as a result of unstable production
growth in agriculture. The maintenance of the industria]. development pro-
grain, therefore, is dependent on the performance of the agricultural sector.
8.        Romania's population growth is around 1.0 percent per annum.    Thus,
the impact of rapid economic growth on per capita incomes has been only mar-
ginally diluted by the population increase. In the last decade, GNP growth
has averaged 9.0 percent per annum, implying a growth of about 8.0 percent per
annum of per capita GNP. A preliminary estimate for GNP per capita in 1974
is US$910 (as presented in the 1975 World Bank Atlas).
9.        The organization of production in both the urban sector and in agri-
culture is such that all labor is employed and there is no open unemployment.
There is, however, some seasonal labor surplus, mainly in agriculture. Income
distribution is also relatively equal. In 1974, average monthly wages were



- 3 -
1,663 lei (over $80 equivalent) per month, up 6.4 percent over the previous
year. Almost 80 percent of all monthly wages in 1972 were within the range of
900-2,000 lei and less than 6 percent were under 900 lei. Prices for essen-
tial consumer goods and services such as basic foodstuffs, rents and urban
transport are relatively low and most social services, notably education and
health care, are provided without charge. Continuous efforts are made to
increase the standard of living. Romania also pursues a positive regional
policy which has sought to bring a balanced development of both human and
natural resources to all parts of the country.
10.       The official exchange rate of lei 4.97 per US$1 is usecd only for
accounting purposes. The rate used for tourist transactions is ]ei 12 per
US$1, having been revalued from a rate of lei 14.38 per US$1 in October 1974.
Under a new system introduced in January 1974, the prices of all traded goods
are converted at a uniform rate of lei 20 per US$1, a rate which is considered
by the Romanians as being representative of the cost of convertible foreign
exchange. For imported goods, the domestic lei price is found by adding to
the foreign price converted at the new rate a tariff rate which varies for
different types of goods. The rate of lei 20 per US$1 has also been used
to convert national income statistics from lei to dollars. Consequently,
this rate has been used as the base rate for calculations in the appraisal.
Recent Developments
11.       Since the National Party Conference of 1967, which set the stage
for major qualitative advances in Romania's economic and social clevelopment,
there have been important new emphases in Romania's economic management.
Measures were taken to improve the institutional basis of planning (e.g. by
creating the Centrals tD assist in plan administration), to increase the ef-
ficiency of economic management and to improve upon the quality of production
in industry. In agriculture efforts were made to raise productivity and
stabilize growth through irrigation, mechanization and the expanded use of
chemical fertilizers. To promote the growth of foreign trade and technical-
economic cooperation the Romanian Government has concluded trade and coopera-
tion agreements with a wide range of countries. In this context also, Romania
has made positive efforts to expand its multilateral external relations and to
pursue full cooperation with the international agencies, including UN, UNCTAD,
UNESCO, FAO, UNIDO and GATT.
12.       Measures aimed at continued improvement of the management system
include a reorganization (involving a reduction from 217 to 95) in the number
of industrial Centrals and a concentration of their planning, control and
research functions. Th,s pursuit of purely physical goals in production and
trade, while still an important element in the system, is being supplemented
by much greater emphasis on productive and investment efficiency, product
quality, pricing and foreign competitiveness. To eliminate wasteful invest-
ment and production expienditures, a Superior Court of Financial Control has
been established, among other things, to oversee a new system of financial
control.



--4 -
13.       Foreign trade has expanded quite rapidly in recent years both in
volume and in regional diversity. There has also been a tendency to move
away from trade on a bilateral barter basis toward trade involving multilat-
eral payments. During the period 1971-74, total foreign trade grew at about
34 percent per annum in current prices. As a result of both rapid world
price increases and expanded volume of trade, the total value of trade grew by
38 percent in 1974, with exports growing by 32 percent to US$4.9 billion, and
imports increasing by about 47 percent to US$5.1 billion. About 59 percent
of 1974 trade was with non-socialist countries, compared with 50 percent in
the previous year, a trend largely explained by the more rapid price increases
in non-socialist trade. Overall trade deficits have generally remained small,
but in 1974 there was an overall trade deficit of $191 million, while the
deficit with the convertible area was over $300 million. In recent years
imports from East European Socialist countries have been slightly lower than
Romania's exports to that region. In Romania's trade with Western industrial-
ized countries, on the other hand, exports typically have been much less than
imports. These deficits have sometimes been increased by deficits on the in-
visibles account with Western countries.
14.       The structure of Romania's trade with the developed market econo-
mies remains essentially unfavorable. Raw materials and agricultural commod-
ities, both of which are subject to unstable price and production conditions,
comprise about 60 percent of total exports to these countries. At the same
time imports from these countries are largely of machines and equipment and
other manufactures. Because of the present low level of reserves, any instab-
ility in export performance, as frequently arises from shortfalls in agricul-
ture (paragraph 7 above), tends to place the import program in immediate
jeopardy, and shortages of convertible currencies would persist even if
Romania were to have recurring over<all trade surpluses.
15.       During July 1975, serious floods caused extensive economic and
other damage in Romania with losses to agriculture, transport and national
industrial enterprises estimated at about US$800 million. The floods also
damaged about 250 local industrial enterprises, housing, and community facil-
ities in 1,300 villages and 65 towns which were flooded. It will take at
least one or two years to complete rehabilitation of flood damages and several
years for the economy to recover fuLly.
External Assistance
16.       The expansion of Romania's trade with the non-socialist industrial
countries has led to an increased need to obtain convertible currencies to pay
for imports from those countries. Romania has met this need both by borrowing
abroad and by mounting a major effort to expand exports and tourism. Gross in-
flows of convertible currency through medium- and long-term loans were US$1,055
million in 1974, consisting mostly of financial and suppliers' credits with
relatively short repayment periods. This gross inflow represented a net inflow
of some $643 million after accounting for the country's repayment obligations.



- 5 -
17.       As part of its effort to expand its foreign trade and cooperation
relationships, Romania has also taken active steps to attract long-.term pri-
vate capital. A regulation passed in 1972 defines the conditions under which
foreign firms can establish joint ventures with domestic enterprises, prefer-
ably in foreign exchange earning/saving industries. In November 1975, six
joint venture agreements had been signed, involving direct foreign investment
of about US$10 to 15 million. Romania also receives medium-term trade credits
from U.S. Eximbank and trades under ECGD, COFACE, and HERMES credit guarantees
with the United Kingdom, 7rance and the Federal Republic of Germany, respec-
tively. Romania succeeded recently in securing a US$60 million, eight-year
loan from Kuwait as part of a general cooperation agreement. In addition,
Romania has access to non--convertible currency investment credits from the
International Investment Bank, Moscow, from which it has borrowed US$30 mil-
lion so far.
18.       As it stands, therefore, Romania's access to long-term finance in
convertible currencies is still very restricted. The IBRD is the only major
source of long-term development finance, though Romania is making efforts to
improve its access to the major financial markets. The Bank's presence on a
significant scale would have a positive influence in this regard, and the Bank
might serve as a catalyst for involving other lenders in Romania. 'rhis could
serve both to increase the total amount of Bank-sponsored funds available to
Romania and to build outside confidence in the country, thereby enhancing in
the long-term its independent access to the world's financial markets.
Prospects
19.       The new Five-Year Plan (1976-80) reflects Romania's continued
strategy of rapid growth. Investment rates of 33 to 34 percent of national
income are to be maintained, and the major thrust is in industry. While light
industry is to continue its growth, the heavy industry branches are to grow
more rapidly. Continued emphasis is to be maintained on foreign trade and
cooperation, with the aim of securing a continued transfer of technology
needed for the modernization and diversification of Romanian industry.
Greater emphasis than in the 1971-75 Plan is to be given to developing the
infrastructure in agriculture, particularly with regard to irrigation and
drainage and the plans for fertilizer production envisage an increase in
supply sufficient to double the 1974 per hectare application by 1980.
20.       Romania has good potential for further economic growth.    Endowed
with important natural resources (fuels, some minerals, timber, rich soils
and a favorable climate both for agriculture and tourism) and located con-
veniently with respect to its major international markets in the East and
West, the country has built a broad industrial infrastructure (power, metal-
lurgy, chemicals) which will serve as a base for the expansion of secondary
manufacturing sectors such as machine building and consumer durables. Above
all, Romania has a hard-working and increasingly skilled population.
21.       Economic growth and structural change call for the introduction of
new technologies, improvements in the quality of products, more economic use
of materials and factor inputs, and reductions in production costs. The in-
creasing diversity and complexity of Romania's economic structure require con-
tinuing improvements in the efficiency of economic planning and coordination



- 6 -
and further refinements in economic management. To keep up with these changes
and requirements, large programs of education and manpower training have been
mounted, and efforts are being made to strengthen technical cooperation with
industrialized countries and international organizations.
Creditworthiness
22.       As of December 1975, Roinania's total medium and long-term external
debt amounted to US$2,653 million. Most of these debts (US$2,578 million)
were denominated in convertible currencies, the major creditor countries be-
ing Germany, France, UK and Italy. While the total debt does not appear ex-
cessive in relation to the volume and growth of external trade, average maturi-
ties are relatively short and convertible debt service payments are estimated
to be in the order of US$550 million a year during 1975-76. The convertible
debt service ratio was approximately 16 percent in 1975.
23.       The organization of economic activity in Romania and the pursuit
of a development strategy involving high investment/saving rates and rapid
income growth ensure Romania's capacity to service external debt if domestic
resources can be converted into foreign exchange for that purpose. Moreover,
the country's major efforts to expand exports (particularly to convertible
currency areas), to attract private joint venture capital and to seek other
forms of bilateral convertible currency financing are increasing the foreign
exchange available for debt service. Convertible export earnings rose from
US$830 million in 1971 to US$2,619 million in 1974. The preferential trade
status accorded to Romania by the European Communities in June 1973 should
facilitate the further expansion of such exports as should the recent grant-
ing of most favored nation status by the U.S. In 1973,' the Government also
restricted the use of short-term credit facilities from western suppliers in
an effort to improve the structure of the country's external debt. Assuming
a continuation of present export and debt management policies it can be ex-
pected that the debt service ratio will stabilize during the second half of
the 1970's. The country's present outward-looking posture, the success of
both its domestic growth and foreign trade policies, and its potential for
continued development, all support the judgment that Romania is creditworthy
for substantial Bank lending.
24.       When Romania joined the Bank, most pre-war foreign debts of the
country had been settled. The only settlements which were still under dis-
cussion at that time concerned claims in the United Kingdom and in the
United States. With regard to the settlement of claims against Romania's
pre-war debt, the final payments of U.S. claims began in September and will
be completed by October 1976 based upon agreements reached in May 1975. Set-
tlement of British claims proved more difficult, but a major breakthrough
was achieved during the visit of Prime Minister Wilson to Bucharest in
September 1975 and a final agreement was signed in January 1976.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ROMANIA
25.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's ninth to Romania.    Together
with a loan of US$50 million for the Riul Mare-Retezat hydropower project,
also being proposed for consideration by the Executive Directors, it would
bring total Bank commitments to Romania to US$460 million. Disbursements
under previous loans were slow during 1975, but this situation has improved
in recent months. The awarding of contracts under several of the loans is
expected to result in continued improvement in disbursements during 1976.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans to Romania and notes on
the execution of ongoing projects as of February 29, 1975.
26.       Foreign exchange, especially in convertible currencies, continues to
be a major constraint and one of the major objectives of Bank lending continues
to be to help alleviate the country's shortage of foreign exchange by providing
long-term external cap:ital and by financing projects which will expand foreign
exchange earnings or savings. Bank lending also aims at supporting the Govern-
ment's efforts to introduce new industrial technologies to improve the quality
of products and production efficiency, to reduce production costs and to pro-
vide for necessary electric power development. Market aspects and marketing,
especially for export goods, are also emphasized. Special attention is given
to agriculture which is heavily dependent upon favorable weather and where
productivity levels are still comparatively low.
27.       With regard to the prospects for future lending, a further project
for irrigation and possibilities of financing projects for agricultural
credit, anti-friction bearings and heavy machinery are under consideration.
28.       Romania is expected to rely upon the IBRD primarily for funds re-
quired to finance needed convertible currency imports, and all of the loans
except those for agriculture and flood recovery hitherto proposed for Romania
have been based solely upon the Bank's financing of foreign exchange needs.
At the same time, Romania has developed a relatively advanced industrial
structure and is in a position to supply a large proportion of the equipment
and supplies required for the execution of many high priority development
projects. Hence, in a few cases such as the present one, it may be necessary
and appropriate, if the Bank's lending is to provide adequate support to
Romania in high priority fields, to incorporate limited amounts of local
currency financing in particular Bank loans.
29.       In addition to lending, the Bank (through EDI) has assisted Romania
by conducting industrial and transportation project appraisal training courses
for Romanian officials in Belgrade in October 1973 and in Bucharest in January/
February 1975, November/December 1975 and January/February 1976. This assist-
ance will be continued and expanded to include a course in agricultural project
appraisal.
30.       The projects, for which assistance has been committed or is being
considered, represent only a small portion of Romania's total need for ex-
ternal financing and of its total disbursed convertible debt. However, they



- 8 -
will provide a substantial net addition to the inflow of convertible currency
finance, and may set a pattern for obtaining longer term convertible finance
from other sources. The disbursed IBRD debt outstanding to the Bank is ex-
pected to constitute about 11 percent of Romania's total projected convertible
currency debt in 1980; the Bank's share in Romania's debt service payments in
1980 would be about 4 percent.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN ROMANIA
Agriculture
31.       Romania continues to be a highly agrarian country in which progress
in other sectors (especially in industry) depends upon stable growth in agri-
cultural production to provide both convertible foreign exchange earnings and
industrial raw materials. In 1974, agriculture accounted for 16 percent of
national income and 40 percent of the labor force (compared with 74 percent
in 1950). About 14.9 million hectares, or almost two-thirds of the land
area, are used for agriculture; and of these, 8.5 million hectares are in
Wallachia, the region composed of the southern plains of the Danube Valley.
Approximately 65 percent of all agricultural land is used for grain produc-
tion (mainly maize and wheat), while industrial crops (mainly sunflowers) are
the next most important. Vegetables are also produced, often in large-scale
commercial green houses, for domestic consumption and export. Livestock
accounts for 42 percent of agricultural production, and the national live-
stock population in 1975 consisted of 6.0 million cattle, 14.4 million sheep
and goats, 8.6 million pigs and 67.7 million poultry.
32.       Investment in agriculture has lagged behind that in other sectors
with 12.7 percent of actual investments in the 1966-70 Plan period and 14.2
percent planned in 1971-75. The investments achieved in the first four years
of the 1971-75 Plan period were 14.4 percent of total for that period, and the
proportion of investment for agriculture in the 1976-80 Plan period is ex-
pected to be 11.6 percent. However, the average annual investment in agri-
culture during the 1976-80 Plan period is expected to increase by about 50
percent in absolute terms above the average investments from 1971 to 1974. In
addition to investment, the Government has also taken other measures, includ-
ing institutional reforms, price incentives, and production targets and de-
livery schedules to stimulate agricultural production. Growth achieved in
agricultural production has been slower than in other sectors and has been
characterized by sharp year-to-year variations. The major problems of Romanian
agriculture are the instability of its output and low productivity. The pro-
posed project would support improvements in both of these areas.
The Need for Irrigation Infrastructure
33.       Instability in agricultural production results from vulnerability
to erratic weather conditions and the lack of infrastructure to mitigate their
impact. Excessive precipitation and flooding during planting and harvest
seasons, and inadequate rainfall during summer growing seasons, have resulted



- 9 -
in year to year fluctuations in national output of the order of 10 to 20 per-
cent. Fluctuations oi production in particular regions can be even greater.
Only production of vegetables has increased steadily, reflecting the relatively
more controlled conditions under which they are produced. The Government is
well aware of this problem and has placed high priority within the agricultural
sector on solving it. Forty percent of agricultural investment in the 1971-75
Five-Year Plan was for land reclamation, irrigation and drainage; the compar-
able figure for the 1976-80 Five-Year Plan is about 20 percent, reflecting
the increasing need for relatively more investment to make productive use of
irrigation facilities already established. Since 1965, total irrigated land
has been increased from about 0.2 million hectares to 1.2 million hectares in
1974; and, the relative reduction in the share of the agricultural budget al-
located for irrigation notwithstanding, another 750,000 to one million hectares
are expected to be brought under irrigation in the next five years. This re-
flects the high priority which is being given to reducing vulnerability to
weather and stabilizing production in agriculture. The proposed project would
be a part of this program.
Agricultural Productivity
34.       While some productivity gains have been made in recent: years, agri-
cultural productivity per worker remains at only about one-fourth of that of
industry. In addition to improving its irrigation infrastructure, Romania is
also taking measures to improve productivity through upgrading t:he quality of
farm mechanization, increases in the supply and utilization of fertilizers,
and the promotion of agro-industrial enterprises to provide processing and
marketing outlets for increased farm production. Steps are also being taken
to reduce inequality between State farms and cooperatives in access to farm
inputs. State farms, which own 30 percent and cultivate 14 percent of agri-
cultural land, received about 42 percent of on-farm investment in the 1971-75
Plan period. Productivity on State farms is correspondingly higher than that
on cooperatives, but the Government is now moving toward elimination of the
disparities between the two types of farm organization in order to stimulate
general improvement in agricultural productivity. Seventy percent of the land
to be irrigated under the project is owned by cooperatives.
Sector Organization
35.       State enterprises and cooperatives account for the major portion of
agricultural production; individual farmers play a much less significant role,
except in the production of a few selected commodities. State enterprises are
generally large scale, capital intensive farms which have been favored in
terms of land allocation, fertilizer distribution and investments in irriga-
tion and mechanization. There are about 370 such farms employing about 245,000
people and cultivating 2.1 million hectares of agricultural land. Workers on
the farms are employed on salaries which are fixed by law. The State farms
are generally well managed by a director (usually an agricultural engineer)
who is appointed by the Director General for State Farms of the Ministry of
Agriculture and is responsible to a workers' council. The Ministry of Agri-
culture determines the production plans for individual State farms; it also
has a role in determining the use of their profits, a portion of which are
remitted to the State treasury.



- 10 -
36.       There are about 4,420 agricultural production cooperatives with
about 3.4 million member families and cultivating about 9.0 million hectares.
Workers in cooperatives are guaranteed a minimum income, which is generally
lower than the incomes of their counterparts on State farms, but they are
entitled to a share in profits after allowances for reserves and reinvestment.
More than one member of a family frequently works (on a full- or part-time
basis) in the cooperative, and some family members are employed outside of
the cooperatives. Cooperators are also allowed to farm about 0.15 hectares
each in and around their villages for their personal use, and they are allowed
to own livestock. Production on personal plots is always intensive, and pro-
duce is either self-consumed or sold to consumption cooperatives. A coopera-
tive is managed by a General Assembly of cooperators and its elected Presi-
dent; it reports to the District Director General for Agriculture, the local
representative of the Ministry of Agriculture.
37.       Agricultural production has been increased much more by State farms
than by cooperatives in the last decade. Gross agricultural production of
State farms rose by 61 percent and that of cooperatives by 29 percent from
1965 to 1973. Although land area in different kinds of production units has
not changed significantly since 1962, use of fertilizer and other inputs has
been increased much more on State farms than on cooperatives. Investments per
hectare also have been much larger on State farms than on cooperatives. In
1973, 22 percent of the arable land on State farms was irrigated compared with
only 11 percent on cooperatives. Crop yields per ha average 30 to 40 percent
higher on State farms than cooperatives. It appears that marginal productiv-
ity of capital inputs has on average been higher on cooperatives than on State
farms. In any event, there are opportunities for increasing productivity of
cooperatives greatly by expanding the irrigated area and using additional
capital inputs to apply improved technology.
38.        Individual farmers number only about 150,000 families and own about
10 percent of total agricultural land. Their land is often located in moun-
tainous regions. The individual farming subsector has not received strong
Government support but is significant in production of potatoes (15 percent
of production), meat (14 percent of production), milk (19 percent of produc-
tion),eggs (18 percent of production) and wool (12 percent of production).
39.        At the national level, the state institution in the agricultural
sector is the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry. It plays a major role
in preparing the Five-Year Plan for the sector and is the supervisory institu-
tion for plan fulfillment. In each district, the Ministry is represented by a
General Directorate, which is responsible for all agricultural activity in the
district including both cooperatives and State farms. Marketing is organized
nationally under 13 Centrals accountable to the Ministry and responsible for
processing and marketing specified commodities. Each Central obtains produce
at the district level and allocates it among domestic retail, processing,
storage and export channels. A specialized agency is responsible for the
exports of each Central.



The Borrower
40.       The Borrower i:or the proposed loan would be the Bank for Agriculture
and Food Industry (BAFI), which is the Government's specialized agency for in-
vestment projects in agriculture, irrigation and food processing. BAFI was
established in 1968 as a channel for, and administrator of, all investment
funds provided under the State plan for the agricultural sector. Financing
in agriculture had previously been done by a department of the National Bank
of Romania. BAFI is involved in all phases of project appraisal, execution
and supervision, and it has a large technical and economic staff located
in Bucharest, in 39 county (Judet) branch offices and in 100 sub-branches
throughout the country. One of BAFI's more important functions is that of
fiscal agent administering, for the account of the national budget, all
Government investments in State farms and enterprises. BAFI also receives
interest-free funds from the State budget for investment lending to coopera-
tives and repays the Government as it receives repayments of sub-loans from
the cooperatives. BAFI has thorough review and approval procedures for all
investment projects. In addition to BAFI's review, all subprojects for more
than Lei 10,000,000 (US$500,000) are reviewed and approved by the Ministry of
Agriculture and those greater than Lei 70,000,000 (US$3.5 million) must be
approved by the Council of Ministers. BAFI also provides short-term credit
to, and maintains settlement accounts for, all cooperative and State agricul-
tural enterprises; it also acts as fiscal agent for the Government for collec-
tion of State revenues from these enterprises. As the Government's channel
for investment financing, in agriculture, BAFI's primary source of funds is the
State Budget; the Guarantee Agreement therefore includes a provision (Section
2.02) that the Guarantor shall provide all necessary funds for the implementa-
tion and operation of the project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
41.       The project is part of Romania's 1976-80 Plan for increasing irri-
gated land and was proposed for Bank financing in June 1974. Feasibility
studies for the irrigation and agricultural development components of the
project were submitted to the Bank in December 1974 and March 1975 respec-
tively, and the project was appraised in June 1975. Negotiations were held
in Washington in February 1976. The Romanian delegation was led by Mr. Ion
Rusinaru, President of BAFI, and included representatives of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Food Industry and of BAFI.
Project Description
42.       The objective Df the project is to increase and stabilize production
in a relatively poor region west of Constanta and south-east of the Danube
in south-eastern Romania (see map), and in the process to increase farm incomes
in the area. This would be accomplished through construction of Et large irri-
gation system and provision for related agricultural development investments.



- 12 -
About 65,400 hectares of previously rainfed agricultural plateau would be irri-
gated by water pumped from the lower Danube by five main and four secondary
pumping stations. About 19,500 hectares of State farms and about 45,900 hec-
tares cultivated by cooperatives would receive water distributed through about
170 kilometers of concrete-lined canals to 39 pressure pumping stations sup-
plying water to the pipe distribution networks for 31,400 hectares of sprinkler
and 34,000 hectares of furrow irrigation. Also included in the irrigation
component of the project would be portable on-farm sprinkler and furrow irriga-
tion equipment, land leveling works on about 13,000 hectares, soil erosion
control works on 7,000 hectares and in steep ravines draining the project area,
and power transmission lines and transformers serving the pumping stations.
43.       The agricultural development component of the project would include
farm machinery and implements for production of maize, wheat, sunflower, alfalfa,
soybean and other annual crops. It would also establish a 450 hectare vine-
yard and a 350 hectare orchard. Several interrelated investments in livestock
development would include a feedmill with annual capacity of 140,000 tons, a
44,000 ton silo, 11 dairy farms of 830 cows each and two beef fattening farms
with annual meat production of 1,000 tons each. About half of the dairy cows
imported under the project would be used to upgrade stock in dairy farms in
eight judets (counties) in eastern Romania. Also included in the project
would be the provision of a potable water supply to about 15,000 people lo-
cated in 17 communities in the project area. Annex III contains a loan and
project summary; the Appraisal Report (No. 1112-RO, dated March 29, 1976) is
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
Project Execution and Operation
44.       The Mlinistry of Agriculture and Food Industry (MAIA), through its
various departments and trusts, would be responsible for planning, construc-
tion and supervision of all project activities. Planning and design of irri-
gation works would be carried out by the Institute for Land Reclamation
Studies and Design (ISPIF), and construction by the Construction Trust for
Land Reclamation Works (TCIF). Both organizations are part of the Ministry's
Department of Land Reclamation and Agricultural Construction (DIFCA). The irri-
gation works would be operated and maintained by the Ministry's Central for
Operation of Land Reclamation Works (CELIF). The farm development components
of the project would be planned and implemented by beneficiary enterprises and
cooperatives under the general supervision of the Directorate General of Plan-
ning and Development (DGPD) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry.
BAFI would serve as financing agency for all project works under the arrange-
ments noted in paragraph 40 above. All agencies are competent to carry out
the proposed works satisfactorily.
Project Cost and Financing
45.       The estimated total cost of the project is US$130.5 million, with
an estimated foreign exchange component of US$41.7 million or 32 percent of
total costs. The cost estimates are based on unit rates of work that are
prevalent in Romania under the system of regulated prices of materials and
wages. Cost of equipment, materials and livestock, which are likely to be



- 13 -
procured from foreign suppliers, has been estimated at the international prices
prevailing in early 1976. Because detailed engineering has already been
carried out for the irrigation component, which constitutes about 75 percent
of the project cost, physical contingencies have been provided at 7-1/2 percent.
Price contingencies on foreign exchange cost are based on annual increases of
8 percent from 1977 to 1979 and 7 percent thereafter. Due to near zero infla-
tion under the Romanian system of administered prices, price contingencies
on local costs are one percent.
46.       The proposed Bank loan of US$60 million would finance the full for-
eign costs of the project plus US$10.8 million of interest during construction
on the Bank loan and US$7.5 million of local costs. Paragraph 28 above dis-
cusses the need to provide some local cost financing for projects in Romania
which have high economic priority but relatively small foreign exchange com-
ponents. The remaining project costs would be financed by the Government
budget, loans from the Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI) and
cooperatives.
Lending and Relending Arrangements
47.       The proposed loan would be made to BAFI with the guarantee of the
Socialist Republic of Romania, and would be for a term of 20 years, including
five years grace, at an interest rate of 8-1/2 percent per annum. It is the
normal practice in Romania for the State to invest virtually all funds in
agricultural infrastruct:ure projects through BAFI without formal lending
agreements and to recover investment costs from project beneficiaries through
a variety of financing mechanisms including the incomes of State farms, taxes,
pricing mechanisms for t:raded commodities, and payments by cooperatives for
mechanization services. For this reason, BAFI would act as a channel for, but
would not actually relerid, US$28.7 million (all figures include contingencies)
of the Bank loan for thE irrigation system, and funds would be made available
to BAFI from the State budget for repayment of the Bank loan. The agricultural
development component of the project, to which US$20.5 million of the proposed
loan would be allocated, would be financed by BAFI through agricultural credit
subloans to cooperatives at an effective rate of interest of 3 percent per
annum, and to State farms and enterprises at 2 percent during the construction
period and 4 percent thereafter (i.e. at an average rate of no less than 3
percent throughout the entire life of the subloan). As in the earlier cases
of the Sadova-Corabia and Flood Recovery projects, these may be considered
real rates of interest because of the near-zero rate of inflation in Romania.
Since BAFI receives most of its funding from the government budget at very low
rates, its overall borrowing cost is below 1 percent which allows it to operate
profitably despite the negative spread on the Bank loan. Subloans for more
than Lei 20 million (US$1 million) would be subject to IBRD review and approval.
Audit
48.       BAFI would keep separate accounts for all project expenditures and
its transactions are subject to continuous control by internal auditors ap-
pointed by the Ministry of Finance and to an annual audit by inspectors from



- 14 -
the Court of Superior Control which reports directly to the Council of Minis-
ters and the President. BAFI's accounting system and the audit of its trans-
actions are satisfactory and BAFI's audited operating and financing results
would be sent to the Bank not later than five months after the end of BAFI's
fiscal year (Sections 6.01 (c) and (e) of the Loan Agreement).
Procurement
49.       Major equipment and materials for the irrigation system totalling
about US$38 million (including contingencies) would be procured following
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines. A
margin of preference for local equipment manufacturers of 15 percent or
customs duty, whichever is lower, is proposed. It is expected that about 40
percent of the contracts would be won by foreign suppliers. Since Romanian
currency is not freely convertible, international tender documents would state
a conversion rate of US$1 = 20 Lei to be used for bid comparison. An esti-
mated US$13 million (including contingencies) of heifers to be imported for
the project would be procured on the basis of price quotations from suppliers
in at least three countries. The estimated total value of procurement follow-
ing international tendering in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines would
thus be about US$51 million.
Disbursements
50.       The Bank loan would be disbursed for (i) 100 percent of the foreign
expenditures for imported equipment, materials and dairy cows, (ii) 100 percent
of the ex-factory expenditures for goods procured locally through international
competitive bidding, (iii) 25 percent of BAFI loans disbursed, and (iv) interest
during construction. Submission of a certificate evidencing necessary govern-
ment approvals of agricultural credit subprojects would be a condition of dis-
bursement for each of the subprojects under the agricultural development compo-
nent of the project.
International Water Rights
51.       The normal water flow in the Danube at Rasova declines from about
13,000 cubic meters per second (m3/sec) during the spring (March through May)
to about 6,000 m3/sec in July, and continues to decline to as low as 2,000
m3/sec in October and November. The project would utilize water pumped from
the Danube at a peak rate of 49 m3/sec in July when the Danube flow is seldom
less than 6,000 m3/sec. This rate of extraction would be less than one percent
of normal flow, and the project does not present any practical problem on the
use of the international waters of the river. Romania has advised the Bank (i)
that it has undertaken towards the other riparian states to maintain the Danube
in navigable condition with a minimum flow of 935 m3/sec, (ii) that the use of
water by Romania's current and proposed irrigation projects will not interfere
with navigation and (iii) that it is under no international legal obligations
to obtain agreement of the other riparians to the project and that no objections
have been received from the other riparians on Romania's use of Danube waters.



- 15 -
Environment and Healthl
52.       The project area is free of endemic diseases such as malaria and
bilharzia. The project would not adversely affect the environment or public
health; in fact the project would improve the health of about one-half of the
project area's population by providing piped drinking water supply to replace
less sanitary open wells currently in use. Construction of irrigation works,
with variable water flows in the canals, and a piped distribution network would
not promote mosquito breeding and spread of malaria.
Benefits
53.       The project would contribute to Romania's overall effort to increase
and stabilize agricultural production through investment in irrigation and re-
lated farm development. Without the project, production under rainfed agri-
culture could be expected to fluctuate by as much as 20 percent from year to
year with an annual average gross production of about US$8.5 million, and the
project area could be expected to remain a relatively undeveloped region of
the country. The project is expected to increase the gross value output to a
relatively stable US$32.5 million annually, an increase of 280 percent. This
would be achieved through (i) a 17 percent increase in cropping intensity made
possible by irrigation, (ii) increases in crop yields ranging from 100 to 240
percent, and (iii) a shift of cropping patterns to emphasize production of
higher yielding crops such as maize, soybeans and sugar beets. As noted in
paragraph 47 above, project costs would be recovered through a variety of
direct and indirect mechanisms. As far as the irrigation component is con-
cerned, the anticipated direct and indirect collections from the beneficiaries
(which include inter alia water charges; profits of State farms and enterprises
credited to the budget; incremental income tax on increased personal income of
members of cooperatives; contributions of State farms and enterprises to a
depreciation fund) would recover, over the component's assumed Life of 40 years,
its full operation and maintenance cost and about 55 percent of the investment
cost at 3 percent interest. Farm development investments would be financed
through BAFI loans, which would be recovered from the beneficiary entities in
accordance with the agreed terms of these loans. Net foreign exchange earnings
as a result of the project are estimated at US$10 million annually. Six thou-
sand members of cooperatives and their families, totalling 13,000 people,
would be the principal beneficiaries of the project. Their incomes per family
member are expected to increase on average from the present US$190 to US$400
after the farm develop.ment components of the project achieve full production
in 1984. Average monthly wages of the cooperators are presently only about
half the national average monthly wage. In addition, the project would pro-
vide piped drinking water supply to 15,000 people in 17 communit:ies in the
project area. The economic rate of return of the irrigation component includ-
ing orchards and vineyards (about 66 percent of total cost), is 17.9 percent.
The return for dairy farms (about 13 percent of total cost) is estimated at
14.2 percent, beef fattening farms (about 1 percent of total cost) 20.2
percent, and the feedmill (about 4 percent of total cost) 10.8 percent. The
economic rate of return of the project as a whole is estimated at 17.4 percent.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
54.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Bank for Agricul-
ture and Food Industry of Romania, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the
Socialist Republic of Romania and the Bank, the report of the Committee pro-
vided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the
draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The features of the Loan and Guarantee Agree-
ments of special interest are referred to in paragraphs 40 and 50 of this
report. Approval by the Council of Ministers of the technical and economic
indicators for the irrigation components of the project (i.e. authorization
to begin execution of this part of the project) would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan (Section 7.01 of the Loan Agreement).
55.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
56.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Ln. No. 1020-RO      Bacau Fertilizer Project; US$60 million Loan of
June 28, 1974; Effectiveness Date: December 31, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
This loan was approved by the Executive Directors on June 27, 1974.
It was signed on June 28 and became effective on December 31, 1974. By agree-
ment between the Bank and the Borrower, the project site was changed from
Tecuci to Bacau which is more advantageous from the point of view of controll-
ing effluents. After a slow start, due mainly to-the change of site, lack of
familiarity with Bank procurement procedures, and the floods of spring 1975,
the project is now proceeding satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 1027-RO      Otelinox Special Steel Project; US$70 million Loan of
July 10, 1974; Effectiveness Date: April 4, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
This loan was approved by the Executive Directors on July 5, 1974.
It was signed on July 10 and became effective on April 4, 1975. Execution
of the project has been delayed several months, primarily because of the com-
plexity of two large bid packages and because of the Romanians' lack of famil-
iarity with international competitive bidding procedures under the Bank's
Guidelines. Progress on procurement has been closely monitored by several
Bank supervision missions. Bids for the cold mill have been evaluated and
the final revisions of the contract for its construction are expected to be
submitted to the Bank for approval shortly. Bids for the hot mill are ex-
pected in May.
Ln. No. 1028-RO      Turceni Thermal Power Project; US$60 million Loan of
July 10, 1974; Effectiveness Date: November 6, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This loan was approved by the Executive Directors on July 5, 1974.
It was signed on July 10 and became effective November 6, 1974. Physical
execution is proceeding smoothly. The project cost is likely to be US$377
million which is 6.6% above the appraisal estimate and the foreign cost is
now likely to be US$100 million which is 12.3% over the appraisal estimate.
Delivery times for vital foreign supply components threaten to delay the
commissioning of at least the first of the four steam-turbine units. There
have been some delays in construction works due to slowness in preparing
final designs for some works and in organizing timely delivery of materials
and supplies to site. As a result the critical path schedule for execution
of the project is being revised. Major problems were experienced with pro-
curement following a decision of the Council of Ministers to restrict the
value of contracts for thermal power station components and related equip-
ment to be awarded after international competitive bidding to US$20.0 million,
and to utilize the balance of the loan to finance imported supplies for local
manufacturers of thermal power station equipment. Discussions to resolve this
matter are in process.

Ln. No. 1082-RO      Giurgiu-Razmiresti Irrigation Project; US$70 million Loan
of February 6, 1975; Effectiveness Date: May 5, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
This loan was approved by the Executive Directors on January 28, 1975.
It was signed on February 6 and became effective on May 5, 1975. The first
supervision mission was in June 1975. Construction of two main pumping stations,
several pressure pumping stations, power supply lines, canal excavation and
lining, and canal structures has begun. The rate of progress is slow, however,
because of shortage of construction equipment. International procurement has
been delayed because of a delay in appointing consultants to assist with this
work. Because of Romania's lack of familiarity with international competitive
bidding procedures, bid documents prepared for the project had to be revised
and bid opening was deLayed to April 5. After completion of bid evaluations
and award of contracts in spring 1976, project execution and disbursement can
be expected to improve.
Ln. No. 1083-RO      Sadova-Corabia Agricultural Credit Project; US$30 million
Loan of February 6, 1975; Effectiveness Date: April 29,
1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
This loan was approved by the Executive Directors on January 28, 1975.
It was signed on February 6 and became effective on April 29, 1975. Progress
of the project is satisfactory. Contracts for purchasing refrigerated trucks,
building materials, steel products, and electrical cables have been awarded.
Procurement of chemica]s has been initiated. Bids for the premix feed mill
have been received and formula testing is being carried out as part of bid
evaluation which is scheduled for completion in April.
Ln. No. 1169-RO      Flood Recovery Project; US$40 million Loan oF November 12,
1975; Effectiveness Date: December 2, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
This loan was approved by the Executive Directors on November 4,
1975. It was signed on. November 12 and became effective on December 2, 1975.
Project execution is proceeding well and disbursements are ahead of schedule.
Documentation for international competitive bidding is being combined with that
for the Giurgiu-Razmiresti Irrigation Project above.
Ln. No. 1170-RO      Flood Recovery Project: US$20 million Loan of November 12,
1975; Effectiveness Date: December 2, 1975; Closing Date:
March 31, 1977.
This loan was approved by the Executive Directors on November 4,
1975. It was signed on November 12 and became effective on December 2, 1975.
Disbursements under the loan have been slower than anticipated because of dif-
ficulties encountered in Romania in preparing and assembling documentation for

which retroactive financing is provided. Documentation for international com-
petitive bidding under this loan has been combined with that for the Giurgiu-
Razmiresti Irrigation Project above, and it is expected that disbursements
will improve later in 1976.

Procurement:        Major equipment and materials for the irrigation system
from the list in Annex 8, Table 1 of the Appraisal Report
and totalling about US$38 million (including contingencies)
would be procured following international competitive bid-
ding in accordance with Bank Guidelines. A margin of
preference for local equipment manufacturers of 15 percent
or customs duty, whichever is lower, is proposed. It is
expected that about 40 percent of the contracts would be
won by foreign suppliers. Since Romanian currency is not
freely convertible, international tender documents would
state a conversion rate of US$1 = 20 Lei to be used for
bid comparison. An estimated US$13 million (including
contingencies) of heifers to be imported for the project
would be procured on the basis of price quotations from
suppliers in at least three countries. The estimated
total value of procurement following international
tendering in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines would
thus be about US$51 million.
