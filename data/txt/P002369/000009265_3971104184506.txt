SENEGAL
INTEGRATED HEALTH SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
CREDIT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
Borrower:         Republic of Senegal
Beneficiary:      Ministry of Health and Social Action
Poverty:          Not applicable
Credit Amount:   SDR 35.9 million (US$50 million equivalent)
Terms:            Standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity
Commitment Fee:  Standard
Financing Plan:    See Schedule A
Program Objective: The purpose of the Credit is to provide support for the implementation of the
Government's Integrated Health Sector Development Program (IHSDP). The
program objective is to: (a) improve the management and financial viability of
the public health system; (b) improve access to quality health care for the vast
majority of the underserved and vulnerable groups in urban and rural settings;
and (c) contribute to fertility decline and reduce the high population growth
rate by improving the management and delivery of reproductive health
services.
Program Description: The Credit will support a broad sector expenditure program to cover an
initial five-year period (1998 to 2002) of Senegal's ten-year National Health
Development Plan (NHDP) which has been adopted by the Government as the
main conduit for its efforts to expand the population's access to public health
care and to improve the health system's financing and management. The
Government has approached IDA and other donors to jointly support the
IHSDP. The proposed Credit would thus complement other donors'
contributions to the sector and help finance the gap in IHSDP funding
requirements.
The SIP initiative:  The Sectoral Investment Programm initiative adopted for the IHSDP emphasizes
a continuing policy dialogue and phased funding, based on yearly operational
plans financed with other bilateral and multilateral organizations, eligibility
criteria for program resources and sectorwide performance indicators. It is
based on a three-year rolling expenditure plan. IDA credit disbursements can be
made against any of the IHSDP components after the Bank is satisfied that
resources are available for all critical activities. This would be achieved through
joint Government/Donors annual implementation reviews. The annual
operational plans and budgets would cover both the investment and the recurrent
costs. The operational plans cover policies, priority actions and measurable
targets for that year. The IDA Credit would finance investment spending, and
reimburse a specific share of recurrent expenditures for that year. The MHSA's
capacity for joint annual programming and budgeting has been demonstrated
throughout the NHDP and IHSDP design process and more particularly during
the donors' round table meeting held on May 2, 1997 and subsequent program



ii
appraisal conducted from May 26 to June 11, 1997. The IHSDP covers the
following general areas: (a) strengthening and expanding health care coverage
through the renovation of some of the existing Primary Health Care facilities and
construction and equipping of new ones in underserved periurban and rural areas
and basic improvements in infrastructure, equipment replacement and bio-
medical supplies for district, regional and national hospitals in order to reinforce
the quality of referral care and enhance the credibility of the PHC network; (b)
enhancing effectiveness and efficiency in the management and provision of
ambulatory and in-patient care through the development of treatment
guidelines, training of medical, paramedical and management personnel and
the provision of shortterm expert services and teaching aids; and (c) developing
the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Health in the management and
monitoring of health interventions at all levels of the system. The program
would also provide support to help promote community involvement in health
care management and the participation of the private sector and NGOs in the
promotion and delivery of health and family planning information and services
under contractual arrangements with MHSA. In addition, it intends to support
Government's efforts to mobilize alternative resources for health sector
financing through better regulation and monitoring of the health insurance
system, and the promotion of community cooperative health insurance schemes.
Benefits & Risks: Major benefits include a better managed and more efficient public health system;
improvement of the health status of the population; better maternal and child
health and a reduction in preventable infant and maternal deaths and lower fertility
and population growth rates. The main risks are: (i) continuation of a weak
implementation capacity at the MHSA and difficulties in attracting and
maintaining critical staff in the regions, reduced by recruitment and training
measures adopted by the MHSA; (ii) devolution of health administration to local
government without adequate preparation which could slow down program
implementation. This risk will be alleviated through better articulation of the roles
of regional and local institutions promoted by the general decentralization reform
and existing decentralized entities of the MHSA; (iii) uncontrolled increase in
health expenditure and unforeseen economic difficulties which could jeopardize
the financing and sustainability of health services; and (iv) a slower than expected
change in sexual and fertility behavior among the population. The likelihood of
occurrence of these risks is minimized by limiting program interventions to core
investments and rationalizing health expenditures and incremental recurrent costs;
providing training and technical assistance; and by better targeted information,
education and communication campaigns and consistent monitoring.
Environmental:    The handling and management of medical waste and hazardous materials were
assessed during program preparation and specific recommendations for
incinerators, fire protection and waste disposal will be drawn up for health
facilities construction. All program-financed construction would include
drainage, solid waste disposal and sanitary facilities. The program will have no
negative effects on the environment but will contribute to reducing
environmental risks.

SENEGAL
INTEGRATED HEALTH SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
I. INTRODUCTION
A.    BACKGROUND AND STRATEGY
1.1    Senegal's health and social indicators have improved considerably since independence.
Between 1960 and 1986, the mortality rate in Senegal dropped from 25 per thousand to 18 per
thousand, and average life expectancy increased from 38 to 52 years . The infant mortality rate
is currently estimated at 60 deaths per 1000 live births down from 68 in 1992. However, this
aggregate measure hides a wide disparity between urban and rural (55 per thousand and 80 per
thousand, respectively). This decrease is primarily attributed to improvements in access to PHC
and in the quality of surveillance of children under one year of age (coverage rate for the
Expanded Vaccination Program (EVP) is currently 60%).
1.2   Initiated in 1991, the decentralization process resulted in the devolution of health
planning and management responsibility to regional and district health teams and the creation of
community managed cost recovery programs for primary health care which to date, involve more
than 800 elected health committees nationwide. The reforms covering 45 districts, 10 regions
and 7 regional hospitals were implemented over the period 1991-1995 and succeeded in shifting
the emphasis of MHSA activities away from centralized administration and tertiary care down to
the primary health care (PHC) providers at village and district levels. Significant benefits
included substantial increases in the access of the population to a basic primary health care
package, particularly in underserved urban areas, improved availability of essential generic drugs
and increased frequency in the use of public health facilities.
1.3    Much work remains to be done, however, to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
the health system in general. The capacity of the district health teams in the planning and
monitoring function as well as the human and financial resources available to them are still
limited as well. The synergies and complementarity which should exist between the three levels
of health care have yet to be developed. Reforms are needed at the regional and national levels
for the rationalization of health care services and health financing. For this purpose, a
comprehensive Integrated Health Sector Development Program (IHSDP) has been developed
under the leadership of MHSA with donor, and NGO support.
1.4   The IHSDP is based on sectoral studies conducted as part of the IDA-financed PDRH1
project and the IHSDP design process in the areas of health financing, institutional development,
hospital reform, reproductive health, and human resources development. The IHSDP covers an
initial five-year time slice of the Government's ten-year health plan. It is based on a three-year
rolling plan and would be implemented in close collaboration with other donor agencies and
stakeholders at all levels of the Senegalese health care system.



2
1.5   The IHSDP fully supports the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy which is to help the
Government to: (a) improve the management and financial sustainability of the public health
system; (b) improve access to quality public health care for the majority of the underserved and
vulnerable groups in urban and rural settings; and (c) accelerate the decline in fertility rates. The
comprehensive and synergistic approach to health services development under the IHSDP will
facilitate a systemic approach to addressing the health sector service delivery and management
issues at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of the health system. It would help alleviate
the burden on public resources and reform some of the programs that are a vital part of the public
health safety net.
1.6   Institutional reforms will lead to more professionally managed health services at all
levels of the system, resulting in efficiency gains and higher quality care. Similarly, reform of
the hospital sub-sector should result in cost containment and substantial savings in public and
household expenditures on health. Reform of the pharmaceutical sub-sector is designed to
consolidate generic drug import, promote distribution by the private sector and encourage more
systematic prescription of generic drugs by health providers. In health financing, the
mobilization of resources through the rehabilitation of existing obligatory health insurance
schemes and the promotion of community health insurance associations should contribute to
reinforcing the sustainability of the public health system.
1.7    A human resources development plan was fornulated to improve the supply of qualified
personnel as well as reform the basic and continuing education institutions, and their programs.
In the area of reproductive health, the IHSDP will support the Government's efforts to reduce the
incidence of disease and disability among women and children through improved access to pre-
and post-natal care including emergency obstetric care, immunization, increased prevalence of
contraceptive use and prevention and treatment of STDs. In the longer term, the IHSDP will
contribute to a reduction in infant and maternal mortality which should have a positive impact on
poverty alleviation.
B.    THE SECTORAL CONTEXT
The Economic Situation
1.8   The Government of Senegal recently embarked on a structural adjustment path for 1995-
97 geared towards restoring competitiveness. The program is intended to eliminate structural
imbalances stemming from the country's poor economic management record over the past 10
years and lay the foundation for sustainable economic growth. In January 1994, the
Government devalued the CFAF by 50%, dismantled most monopolies through the abolition of
special agreements, amended the labor code, and liberalized access to credit and foreign
exchange.
1.9   Policy reforms pursued since early 1994 have led to a marked recovery of economic
activity and a significant improvement in Senegal's macroeconomic performance and financial
position. Inflation has dropped from about 32% in 1994 to less than 3 % in 1996. After three
years of virtual stagnation, real GDP increased by 2% in 1994, by 4.8% in 1995, and an
estimated 5.2% in 1996. Exports have been growing more rapidly than imports, thereby leading
to a reduction of the external current account deficit from 10.3% in 1993 to 8% in 1996. The
strict budgetary stance has allowed the reduction of the fiscal deficit from almost 6% of GDP in
1994 to less than 2% in 1996. The share of wages and salaries in total expenditures declined



3
from 41% to 36% between 1993 and 1996. As a result of better economic policies and good
rainfall, agricultural production increased by about 11% in 1996, which had substantial positive
effects on the industrial and trade sectors. However, it is still of critical importance to remove
remaining structural rigidities and reinforce efforts to build up human capital and vitalize
infrastructure in order to consolidate recent gains and establish the sustainability of the growth
pattern.
1.10   One of the reform program's major strategic concerns is the need for human resources
development. In the case of the health sector, this has meant increasing the availability and
quality of basic health services in both urban and rural areas, thereby helping to improve the
health status of the population in general and raise the productivity of the working population.
The Government's strategy is to reduce the deficit in health personnel, reverse the trend toward
lower expenditure on maintaining health services by increasing budget appropriations for
maintenance, improving the efficiency of allocations within the sector, and by promoting
alternate financing mechanisms for curative care.
Demographic trends
1.11   Senegal's population was estimated at 8,802,304 inhabitants in 1997 and is expected to
continue to grow at 2.7% annually through the end of the decade (compared to 3% during the
1980s). According to the 1988 census estimates, 40% of the population is urban. Currently,
rural to urban migration is increasing at the rate of 5% per year. The age structure of the
population is very young with the under 20 years representing 56% of the population. Fertility
has slowly but consistently decreased from 7.1 in 1975 to 6.6 in 1986 but still remains high at 5.9
births per woman in 1994. Optimistic projections of declines in fertility suggest that the
population will double within the next 20 years. The Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) is
low with only 9% of married women of reproductive age using modern contraceptive methods.
Given the young age structure of the population, the early age at first marriage (the national
average is 17 years) and widespread polygamy, prospects for a significant reduction in
population growth in the near future are bleak if no major effort is undertaken to step up
reproductive health activities as well as women and girl's education in order to accelerate the
onset of demographic transition. Under the assumption that the current fertility level of 5.9
decreases to 3.8 by the year 2010 and to 2.3 by 2025, Senegal could be expected to reach a
stationary population of 30 million in 2030, the year at which the net reproduction rate would
have reached the population replacement level.
Social Indicators
1.12   Although substantial improvements have been achieved since independence in 1964,
(infant mortality has decreased by almost 40%), Senegal's human indicators of development are
still well below those of other countries at comparable levels of development. Population growth
of 2.7% has substantially exceeded that of GDP, which averaged 1.9% between 1985 and 1995.
Infant and child mortality is still at a high 60% of all deaths; life expectancy and primary school
enrollment are estimated at 52 years and 56%, respectively, compared to the SSA averages of 51
years and 70%.
1.13   The high maternal mortality rate (510 per 100,0000 births) and infant death (60 per one
thousand live birth) are largely attributable to: (i) inadequate pre-natal, delivery and post-natal
care and poor nutritional status (21% of childbearing women do not have a pre-natal



4
examination, and 48% of pregnant women suffer from nutritional anemia); (ii) first pregnancies
at early ages (14.3% before age 16); and (iii) poor emergency obstetric care. Also, certain
traditional practices such as female circumcision and genital mutilation persist, particularly in
rural areas, affecting one fifth of the female population. The need for greater access to family
planning services has been documented repeatedly. For example, in the 1992/93 DHS survey,
59% of the women declared that they did not want to have any more children or wanted to delay
their next pregnancy. This is belied by the low national CPR of 9% and almost universal
knowledge of contraceptives (80%). In conjunction with preventable and treatable diseases,
malnutrition and anemia remain a serious problem, particularly among children and pregnant and
lactating mothers. In addition, the prevalence of STDs and the spread of HIV infections as well
as opportunistic diseases such as tuberculosis are becoming an increasingly serious public health
threat. The latest official data released by Senegal health authorities indicate that the number of
HIV infected cases has increased from 149 in 1988 to 1,247 in 1993.
Sector Organization
1.14   The Senegalese health care system consists of a well defined network of public health
facilities classified according to the level of care. At the first tier, the 733 health posts (1 per
11,000 inhabitants) and 52 district health centers (1 per 150,000 inhabitants). Basic services
provided by a health post include primary curative care, caring for the chronically ill (e.g.,
tuberculosis and leprosy patients), pre-natal consultations family planning and the promotion of
good nutrition, hygiene and water sanitation. District health centers are intended to provide first
level referral to the health posts and limited hospitalization services with a capacity of 10 to 20
beds. At the second tier, there are 7 regional hospitals with a capacity of 100 to 150 beds located
primarily in provincial cities and designed to provide the urban and rural population with some
specialized care. Finally, the third level of care encompasses 1 teaching hospital and 6 general
hospitals all located in the capital city, Dakar. The national role of these third-tier facilities is
considerable. In 1993, they accounted for 35% of assisted deliveries and 50% of hospital
admissions and 64% of the total hospital bed capacity. This share decreased significantly in
1994 and 1995 due to the progress made in the provision of primary health care and first level
referral services. However, demand for secondary and tertiary care is expected to rise as a result
of increased frequency in the use of the PHC system and improved referral services. In 1994, the
public health sector provided 65% of ambulatory care and 85% of hospitalization services.
1.15   The public health network also includes health centers or dispensaries managed by
various ministries, established to provide care to specific constituencies such as students, the
police and military personnel, one major hospital in Dakar, and 73 health posts managed by
municipalities. The private, for-profit sector is not very developed and largely confined to the
more affluent urban areas. It consists of an estimated 27 clinics which offer mainly
obstetrics/gynecological care, and is staffed by 149 general practitioners, 31 dentists, 94
specialists and 134 pharmacists. About 20 large semi-public and a few large private enterprises
provide on-site, health services for employees and their families. Finally, several local NGOs
have begun to integrate health care activities in their program, and 75 health posts are grouped
into a Christian association. Three of these NGOs have a family planning focus for their
activities.
1.16   Communities participate in the management of health facilities through elected health
committees. To date, there are over 800 committees nationwide which manage cost recovery
programs and participate in health management teams at all levels of the health system. The
status of health committees is defined in decree 92-118 which provides the framework for the



5
establishment of health committees and their administration. The general assembly of the health
committees is composed of the head of concessions or village groups or their representatives,
and the representatives of women's groups and youth associations.
1.17   Over the past 20 years, there has been a marked increase in health posts and health
centers. By 1993, there was one health center (district hospital) per 153,000 inhabitants, close to
the national norm of one per 150,000. There was also 1 hospital for every 500,000 inhabitants.
The bed per inhabitant ratio has improved from 1 per 2,000 inhabitants to 1 per 1,200
inhabitants. Much of this may be ascribed to the increase in the number of beds at district level
medical centers.
C.    ISSUESANDACTIONS
1.18   The health system in Senegal is at a crossroads and there is a consensus regarding the
need to find better ways to manage, regulate and finance health care among all parties concerned.
As in many developing countries, hospital care provision is becoming prohibitive and state-
owned and state-operated health facilities are not as efficient as they could be. Sectoral studies
initiated by MHSA under the recently completed Human Resources Development Project
(PDRH1) for Population and Health and as part of the strategic planning process raise four
critical issues on the health sector:
*  the inadequacy and inequities in financing of curative care;
*  the low efficiency in the use of resources by the public sector health facilities;
*  the low utilization and access to health care and family planning services;
e  the inadequacy of the sector's human resources and the lack of effective human resources
development.
Health Finance
1.19   The financial resources level of the sector are particularly low in terms of the scope of
services provided. Financial burden-sharing arrangements for secondary and tertiary levels of
care are not effectively enforced and budget allocations while increasing over the past five year
remain low by international standards. In 1996, recurrent expenditures in health represented
7.3% of the total government expenditures. In per capita terms (see table 1) total public
extenditures (including internal and external investment) in 1996 was equivalent to 1.2% of
GDP or $ 7.50 well below the minimum $9 to $12 per person needed for the provision of a
minimum package of primary health care services as determined in the Africa Region policy
paper, Better Health in Africa.
(a)    Government Expenditures
1.20   As is shown in Table 1, budget allocations have gradually increased from 5.2% of total
recurrent expenditures in 1992 to 7.3% in 1996 . In real terms, total per capita expenditures have
increased significantly since 1992 (with the exception of 1994 when expenditures declined due
to the devaluation of the FCFA) demonstrating strong committment by both government and
donors to the health sector. Three trends may be discerned in the 1990s. The Government has
succeeded in reversing the trend in public health spending away from past increase in the share
of hospital costs and wages outlays toward more expenditures in prevention and basic curative



6
care, logistics and support systems. In relative terms, as is shown in Table 2, the share of the
hospital sector has consistently diminished, from 60% of operating budget allocations to 40%
between 1989 and 1995. Aided by the focus of external donors on primary health care activities,
the first tier system received a more equitable allocation, increasing to 32% of total allocations in
1995. The budget execution rate increased from 74% in 1990 to 95% of allocations in 1995 and
the Government is committed to increasing the share of health care to reach 8.4% of the total
national budget by the year 2002.

1.21   A medium expenditure framework was developed for the IHSDP, integrating the
investment, wage and non-wage (operating) expenditure at the regional and national levels for
the period 1998-2002. Investments will comprise 26.2% of total expenditures, operating costs
42.5% and salaries 31.3%. Financing for the IHSDP will come from: (i) the Government of
Senegal through the national and investment (BCI) budgets; (ii) household contributions through
cost recovery managed by health committees at health posts, health center and hospitals and
insurance program such as the IPMs mutuelles; (iii) local government tax revenues; and (iv)
donors. The IHSDP calls for an increase in expenditures by central and local governments and
by local Health Committees. Under the IHSDP, the government's contribution to the health
sector over the next five years will increase. The Government of Senegal will continue to be the
major source to cover the overwhelming share of wages (88%), half of the operating budget for
the sector and a significant part (18%) of the investment budget. Health committees will provide
almost 11% of the financing requirements for IHSDP, primarily for the health post and health
center level of care; 90% will go to cover operating expenditures. Financing by local
governments is estimated to provide about 6% of financing. Donors will finance 29% of the
IHSDP, ensuring 80% of the investment program and 20% of the operating expenditures.
1.22   Health sector recurrent expenditures as a percentage of total government expenditures
will increase to 8.4% from approximately 7.3% in 1996 - approaching the Government's 9%
target. Expenditures will increase on average by 7.3% per year. Wages will grow by
approximately 4% per annum, less than the increase of operating costs which are forecast to
grow by about 10% per year. Investment allocations are also forecast to grow by about 10% per
annum, reversing the trend of the early 1990's when investment from internal resources were
declining. As a result, the government will finance a significant share (18%) of total investment
under the IHSDP. In conclusion, increased budget allocations for health demonstrate the
government's commitment to the health sector. The proposed increase in expenditures is based
on reasonable assumptions about the Government's capacity to fund the IHSDP. Estimates for
the wage bill are based on realistic assumptions pertaining to the supply of qualified staff and are
consistent with the government's hiring policies. The health sector's share of total recurrent
expenditures grows at 0.3% annually which is less than the 0.5% increase that the government
has committed itself to, represents a continuation of the trends established in recent years.

(b)   Private Resource Mobilization
1.23   Senegal has a tradition of community contributions in the form of user fees and other
cost recovery schemes in health financing that is more developed than that of most African
countries. Private financing of health care is increasing dramatically, now accounting for over
two-thirds of current expenditures, primarily concentrated in household expenditures at local
drug dispensaries. The potential for mobilizing non-budgetary resources to complement public
health costs is significant and should be realized. The inherent risks of inequities in access to
health care for low-income groups posed by this source of financing must be addressed by better
targeting of public resources to protect the poor and through the introduction of lower fees and
exemptions. Because of the lack of reliable data, the importance of private financing is not easy
to determine. In 1995, the total amount of direct payments from households was estimated at
CFAF 19 billion (not including contributions to mandatory health insurance). Estimated
contributions for 1996 under municipal taxation were approximately CFAF 1.2 billion of which
Commune Urbaine de Dakar (CUD) contributed over 85%.
1.24   Based on the law of 1972 amended in 1983, rural communities and communes have
regularly been required to contribute to the recurrent costs of community and district health
facilities. However, the target of 8% of the rural tax revenues which should be devoted to health
has not been reached, and, on average, the share of rural taxation that went to health remained
constant at an estimated 4% of total tax revenues with the exception of Dakar municipality which
contributed CFAF 1 billion in 1992 and typically contributes approximately CFAF 800 million
annually for personnel and operating costs of its community health structures with the
implementation of the regionalization.
1.25   Health committees' contributions at the district level amounted to CFAF 1.8 billion in
1994 and CFAF 2.2 billion in 1995. In the
Table S                    same year, income from fees at district

Religious institutions     714    1.60        Sante and 34% by the Government budget.
This trend is greater at the level of health
posts where operating expenses (with the exception of salaries and equipment amortization) are
covered completely by income formn fees with a cost-recovery rate of 1.12%.
Alternate Forms of Finance
1.26   Faced with increasing expenditures and demands, the Government is looking to health
insurance as a source of health care financing, but has yet to adopt concrete legislative and
regulatory measures to promote this supplement to state budget financing. Today, about 13% of
the population is covered by a modern insurance plan, of which only 6% are civil servants.
Health insurance in Senegal is an increasingly important mechanism through which health
expenditures are made. In fact, transfers through health insurance amounted to 18.6% of total
health expenditures in 1989 compared to 14.8% in 1981. Various health insurance schemes



9
exist in the modem private sector, but do not seem to have developed in the public sector.
Informal mutual health insurance associations exist that could be promoted to cover health
expenditures.
1.27   Health Maintenance Funds (Institutions de Prevoyance Maladie.-IPM-) cover only
salaried employees in the private sector (ca. 85,000) with a total of 500,000 beneficiaries.
Billings in 1995 were greater than that year's annual contributions. Total contributions to IPMs
were approximately CFAF 8 billion in 1995 with CFAF 6.5 billion in payments for health care
and over CFAF 13.5 billion outstanding bills. There are major disparities in IPMs administration
a lack of standards and operations norms and weak regulatory and monitoring framework. IPMs
are largely autonomous but whereas this autonomy has certain advantages, such as their ability to
set contribution levels the negative perceptions of the quality of public health care constitute a
serious constraint for their sustainability. With the exception of some public hospital care which
is not available elsewhere in the country, IPMs function separately from the public health sector.
The IPM beneficiaries' high usage of private care facilities and the volume of their expenditures
on drugs are particularly striking.
1.28   A survey of 24 IPMs (approximately one fifth of the total number of IPMs in the
country) conducted in 1997, found that approximately 25% of IPMs function correctly, 25%
were in poor financial state and required vigorous restructuring, and 50% were financially
vulnerable for diverse reasons. All IPMs still have a long way to go, however, in the application
of effective risk management tools and the use of co-payments. Many IPMs have made
commitments beyond their means and without sufficient prospects for cost-recovery. This has
resulted in defaults by several IPMs.
1.29   Mutual Health Insurance Associations in Senegal benefit from several preconditions that
favor their development. A political     Other Forms of Health Insurance

MHIAs, notably Mutualite Francaise and
Mutualite Chretienne de Belgique.
1.30   There are however, several constraints to the development of MHIAs in Senegal. There
is no specific statutory and regulatory framework and internalization of the health insurance
association concept is insufficient, which limits their capacity to expand their membership and
ensure long-term sustainability. Also, MHIA managers lack training and experience adding



10
further risks to MHIAs' financial viability. Finally, the majority of existing MHIAs have, until
now, paid insufficient attention to developing partnerships with health care suppliers and
providers. This type of collaboration will be essential in order to control costs and quality of
care.
(c)    External Aid to the Health Sector
1.31   External aid which accounted for 83.2 percent of the Triennial Public Investment Plan in
1991 (TPIP) rose to 93.4 percent in 1996. External financing for health care doubled (152
percent increase) between 1991 and 1996 while external financing for other sectors only
increased 60 percent. Overall external aid for the health sector has been approximately US$ 28
million per year over the last five years. Multilateral aid has caught up with bilateral aid (51 % in
1994). France accounted for 50 percent of this aid and 30 percent of the French portion was
allocated to the health sector.

External aid covers 75% of operating
costs of the health sector (due to the large technical assistance component which is considered
operating cost) with only 25% going to investments. In 1997 external aid is estimated at 12
Billion FCFA or approximately US$ 25 million.
Health Care Provision
1.33   Despite the progress made during the past five years as a result of the policy shift toward
prevention programs and the provision of a minimum package of primary health care, much
remains to be done with respect to the human, financial and physical factors that facilitate
improvements in the efficiency and quality of health care management. The capacity to
organize, integrate and deliver priority packages of services needs to be further strengthened at
all levels of the system since many health facilities remain poorly equipped, poorly managed,
and under-utilized. This is reflected in the continuing low usage rate for PHC facilities (0.4
visits/per inhabitant in 1996 up from 0.2 in 1990), the low bed occupancy rate at district
hospitals (18%), and variances in the rates for secondary and tertiary care facilities (ranging from
92% to 9% in some hospital wards). Another pervasive problem is the mediocre level of
maintenance for buildings, biomedical equipment and utility systems. Major management
reform and the restructuring of existing institutions as well as the elaboration of a new



11
legislative, and regulatory framework for the development of the health care system have
become necessary to address these imbalances.
(a)    Primary Health Care
1.34   Access to PHC and first level referral services continues to be characterized by
disparities and by the poor quality of services as evidenced by the high prevalence of preventable
and treatable diseases. Additional work is required for Senegal to: (a) further improve and
expand services in all regions and district; (b) strengthen implementation monitoring and
evaluation of district health plans; and (c) decentralize training, maintenance and operation
management. The Government's objective is to achieve, by year 2002, universal access of the
population to a minimum package of integrated PHC services and first level referral services
including reproductive health care. This implies an increase in the percentage of population
living within a 5-mile radius of a health facility, from the current average of 50% to 80% of the
population.
(b)    The Hospital Subsector
1.35   Although secondary and tertiary care public hospitals have benefited from major
resources in the past and may have functioned properly when demand was limited and external
aid was constant, this is no longer the case. Hospitals have inadequate resources to balance their
budgets and maintain their equipment and rely heavily on public subsidies to sustain their
services. In general, consumer perception of the quality of care provided by public hospitals is
poor and the tendency of the higher income groups to seek private health care providers suggest
that, if current trends continue, public hospitals will receive only the lowest, most disadvantaged
segments of the population who cannot afford these services or for special interventions which
private clinics cannot provide . This will further exacerbate their financial difficulties and
weaken their role in the referral system. While the establishment of Comites de Sante and the
introduction of user fees have allowed hospitals to recover a share of their costs, nevertheless,
their capacity to achieve a higher level of sustainability under existing conditions is questionable.
Furthermore, most of them operate according to administrative rather than performance based
and cost efficiency rules. In view of this situation, the following principles have guided the
proposed reform program: (i) increased accountability of hospital management; (ii) better
targeting of state subsidies to enhance equity in access to curative care; (iii) the pre-eminence of
quality, cost effectiveness and efficiency; and (iv) control of hospital expenditures within the
context of overall health care expenditures. A new hospital law and a decree covering hospital
reorganization and management have been drafted by MHSA and provide an adequate
framework to better regulate and organize the hospital sub-sector. (see Annexe 3). An effort has
been made to minimize subsequent delays by preparing the implementation decree in parallel to
the law. The MHSA has provided committment to expeditious implementation upon approval of
the law by parliament.
1.36   A new more autonomous, more efficient hospital management is expected to emerge
through the process of reform. The reforms involve the following elements: (i) the development
of a nationwide hospital mapping which will classify hospitals according to their position in the
health pyramid and establish a more efficient referral network system taking into account the
complementarity which should exist between all levels of health care; (ii) the development of
management tools and training programs to improve the capacity of hospital managers; (iii) the
development of hospital charter projects; and (iv) the creation of occupational streams for



12
hospital personnel. The implementation of these reforms will be phased over the ten year period
of the NHSAP. The first two phases which will take place during the IHSDP will consist of: (a)
technical support, orientation and short term training to help hospitals define packages of
essential services, prepare their charter projects and development plans to enable them to
become eligible for additional funding; and (b) the financing of up to two hospital development
plans under the IHSDP. While some of the capacity building activities would be made available
to all hospitals, the capacity for reform will be initially tested only at one or a maximum of two
pilot hospitals and later expanded as management capacity develops. This phased approach to
hospital reform is based on best practices in lower middle income countries such as Tunisia,
Morocco and Egypt. Hospital development plan proposals would receive IHSDP funding based
on the establishment of a sustainable financing plan for the hospital and a clear set of
performance measures which will be spelled out in a memorandum of understanding
(Conventions) between MHSA and the hospital's management boards. Criteria for the selection
of hospitals would be based on the principles described in par. 1.36 above. The IHSDP envisage
disbursement for hospital development only from year 3 of the program.
Reproductive Health
1.37   Past efforts to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality rates and create demand for
spacing or limiting births, have not delivered the anticipated result. Contraceptive rates,
although on the rise, have not reached a level to have any significant impact on fertility.
Improving the health status of women and children constitute one of the major challenges facing
the public health sector. The problem is compounded by inequities in the distribution of
resources related to reproductive health care and the lack of integration of the four critical
programs which handle reproductive health related activities (MCH, FP, Nutrition and
AIDS/STDs). Some of the major constraining factors to reproductive health services' expansion
include: (i) insufficient equipment and facilities; (ii) poor management of pre-natal, post-partum
and emergency obstetric care; (iii) limited technical capacity of personnel in the provision of
integrated services; and (iv) lack of standardized guidelines for service providers.
1.38   Concerning Family Planning (FP), the low demand for contraceptive services is
attributed to the lack of effectiveness of service delivery and IEC activities. It is also interesting
to note that FP services are heavily subsidized and externally financed, although a social
marketing program for contraceptives was recently launched in an attempt to transfer a share of
contraceptive costs to users. Senegal has succeeded in attaining almost universal knowledge of
modern contraceptives among the population but has yet to generate higher demand for FP
services. The nature of the problem appears to lie more in the realm of behavior. Still, there is a
need to strengthen both the demand and supply sides to achieve the desired goal of a substantial
increase in the contraceptive prevalence rate. The new National Reproductive Health Program
which encompasses (AID/STD prevention and treatment, FP, Women and Child Health) will
address both accessibility and quality issues through improvements in the delivery of integrated
PHC information and services and first level referrals.

Human Resources Development
1.39   There has been an acute shortage of qualified personnel at all levels of the system.
Despite efforts, since independence, to
recruit qualified personnel, Senegal still
Real MISA personnel expendtures     lags far behind WHO norms. Where a
10,000_.                                 state nurse would be responsible for 300

or older with 15% to 17% within 5 years
of retirement. This means that by 2000
up to one-fifth of the MHSA work force would have left. The deficit is most marked in the ranks
of specialists (gynecologists, surgeons, anesthesiologists, ophthalmologists). The few specialists
(physicians paramedics and nurses) in the system are concentrated in Dakar, leaving the regional
and district hospitals unable to provide curative care corresponding to their level in the referral
system. Other reasons for the recruitment shortfall include the lack of incentives, and inadequate
training. In terms of professional training, the links between academic institutions and the
MHSA--the primary "client" for graduates--need further reinforcement to achieve the
Government's goal of attaining an optimal balance between graduates and job opportunities in
the health sector. Continuing education and short-term training is fragmented and poorly
targeted, with uncoordinated and often incoherent interventions.
1.40   During the 1980s, as part of the Government's efforts to streamline and decentralize
activities, the Ministries of Health and Social Action were merged and the number of directorates
was reduced from six to three with the other directorates becoming bureaus directly under the
supervision and control of the cabinet. At the central level, the Directorate of Public Health
(DHSP) was authorized to coordinate and monitor a large number of vertical programs as well as
the medical regions and districts while the Directorate of General Administration and Equipment
(DAGE) was responsible for financial and human resources management including procurement
and maintenance. At the district level, each district was supposed to have two physicians, a chief
medical officer and a team of four supervisors. However, the Government has had difficulties in
meeting these norms and district teams need to be reinforced to improve administration and
supervision (many districts have currently only one physician). At the central level, because of
budget constraints DHSP and DAGE remained poorly staffed, ill-equipped and unable to fulfill
their respective mandates. The new strategic framework for health sector development adopted
by the Government prioritizes the integration of vertical programs and the strengthening of
financial and human resources management at all levels. At the central level, emphasis is now
being placed on capacity building through training and new recruitment, and the reorganization
of the administrative and management functions.
D.    GOVERNMENTPOLICIES AND STRA TEGIC FRAMEWORK
1.41   The Government's commitment to improve the management and delivery of public health
services, further decentralization and the promotion of cost sharing and greater community



14
participation at all levels of the health delivery system is closely stated in the National Health Policy
Statement (NIHP) adopted in June 1989 and the recently developed document entitled "Nouvelles
Orientations de la Politique de Sante et de l 'Action Sociale, Juin 1996". The Government's new
strategy is consistent with the approach outlined in the 1993 World Development Report, and the
Africa Region policy paper "Better Health in Africa ", and constitutes a sound framework for the
development of the health sector. The strategy aims at: (i) improving the quality and efficiency of
service delivery at all levels in the health system; (ii) expanding coverage of integrated PHC
including reproductive health and referral services in both urban and rural areas; (iii) implementing
integrated systems for the prevention and control of communicable diseases; and (iv) redirecting the
pharmaceutical sub-sector toward the use of generic drugs. The strategy also seeks to strengthen
partnerships in health through increased participation of non-profit and for-profit providers of health
and family planning services. Beneficiary participation, through elected health committees, will be
reinforced through a series of legislative and statutory measures to promote a federative movement
of health associations as well as community-managed health insurance schemes with solidarity
mechanisms for the poor. Preparation of the ten-year health development plan and five-year
investment program to implement this framework initiated in June 1996, was completed in April
1997 by a national team with the support of multilateral and bilateral donors, including IDA.
1.42   A consensus on a reform agenda has been reached within the Government to cover the
following measures:
*    an autonomous status for public hospitals and the PNA (the public drug
procurement agency);
*    revision of the regulatory framework for procurement, distribution, quality
control and inspection of drugs including promotion and pricing guidelines for
the use of generic drugs in both the public and the private sector;
*    development of a legislative and regulatory framework for MHIA;
*    revision of the status of health committees;
*    decentralization of financial and human resources management aiming the
regions and districts; and
-    restructuring of the central health administration.
1.43 By the year 2002, the Government's objectives are to reduce maternal mortality by 25%,
increase vaccination coverage to 80%, increase contraceptive prevalence to 16%, and increase
the share of health in the state recurrent expenses budget to 9%.
1.44   The Government is committed to achieving a lower population growth path and has recently
re-assessed its population policy to bring it in line with the principles adopted at the International
Conference on Population and Development (ICPD, Cairo, September 1995). In the health sector,
the Government has already taken steps to: (i) expand reproductive health information, education,
and communication (IEC) activities in favor of a delayed age of marriage, breast-feeding and birth
spacing; (ii) step up the integration of pre- and post-natal care including high risk pregnancy
management and the provision of emergency obstetric care; and (iii) improve contraceptive methods'
availability including clinical methods (IUD, tubal ligations, implants, and injections). For the first
time in Senegal, four major NGOs have benefited from Government contracts using borrowed
resources (IDA PHRD1 Credit) to conduct family planning activities. Under the IHSDP, the
participation of NGOs in the delivery of health and Family planning information will be further
expanded. In 1990, a major national program was launched against HIV/AIDS and STD prevention
and treatment. Activities under this program will now become fully integrated in the reproductive
health package.



15
The National Health and Social Action Development Plan
1.45   Following the adoption of the strategic framework, preparation of the ten-year plan and the
first five-year Integrated Health Sector Development Program (IHSDP) has proceeded well, largely
as a result of the strong leadership role played by the MPHSA with support from multilateral and
bilateral donors. Donor coordination was effective and well orchestrated by a core group of highly
motivated Senegalese health officials who were assigned the responsibility of coordinating
preparation of the plan and sector investment program. The planning process was highly
participatory, with NGOs and beneficiaries taking an active role in the definition of priorities. It was
based on the wellprepared district and regional health development plans, the reform of state
hospitals; the promotion of cost-recovery through mandatory health protection plans as well as
optional community-based health insurance schemes; disease prevention and control and an overall
assessment of the human resources development needs.
1.46   The provision of an integrated package of Primary Health Care (PHC) and first level
referral services throughout the country remain at the core of the sector's development objectives.
These will be undertaken in conjunction with capacity building measures to strengthen the
managerial capacity and increase quality and coverage of service delivery at all levels of the system.
1.47   The IHSDP priorities cover a broad range of activities identified in the district, regional
and central health development plans. These priorities have been regrouped under the following
strategies:
*  Improving access and quality of health services to underserved population;
*  Improving performance of the reproductive health program;
*  Strengthening institutional capacity;
*  Reinforcing epidemiological surveillance and the control of endemic diseases;
*  Improving the quality of life of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.
1.48   The scope of IHSDP activities will cover implementation of the priority strategies mentioned
above. Its financing will be drawn from several sources, including the state, the population (through
cost- recovery), local communities through tax revenues, and donors including international NGOs.
AfDB, the E.U, IDB, NDF, JICA, KFW, the Kingdom of Belgium, the French Cooperation, the
Netherlands Cooperation, Taiwan, USAID, UNICEF and UNFPA will contribute to the program.
Finally, part of the financing will come from the private sector in the form of payment from health
insurance schemes.
1.49   The IHSDP implementation would be the responsibility of MHSA central technical divisions
and regional and district health teams. These different parties will be responsible for the
management of resources allocated to them under the Program, essentially for training activities,
operations and logistics and monitoring and evaluation. Financial management would be the
responsibility of the Directorate of General Administration and Equipment (DAGE). The MHSA
will delegate or contract out civil work management, training and reproductive health services for
specific target groups.
The Sectoral Investment Program Approach
1.50   The issue of a traditional investment project versus a broader sectoral investment
program was thoroughly discussed with Government and donor agencies during the program
identification and preparation stages. The decision to move forward with a sector approach is



16
based on: (a) the willingness of donors to participate in a sector investment program and support
implementation of the Government development plan; and (b) commitment of the Government
to define a long-term policy framework which addresses all key issues of health financing,
efficiency and sustainability. In addition, implementation of the health reform agenda initiated
in 1991 was well sustained during the past five years. The key reforms successfully
implemented include: (i) the adoption of a district approach to primary health care and first level
referral and decentralization of the health planning function among the districts; (ii) the creation
of a nation-wide market for generic drugs; and (iii) cost recovery and cost sharing through
community participation and elected health committees at all levels of the health system. This
has laid the foundation for a comprehensive reform of the health sector involving all major
stakeholders.
1.51   Alternative project designs considered included: (i) a specific investment to consolidate
a district approach based on primary health care and first level referral; (ii) a reiteration of a
multi-sectoral population project similar to the PDRH1; and (iii) a reproductive health
investment project incorporating private sector providers. Under all three alternatives, the
impact would have been limited. Small district hospitals are unlikely to cover all curative
treatment needs of the population and would, in the short run, probably not attract the specialized
technical and management staff required to integrate a full package of curative services
including complications of pregnancies and childbirth. The organization and management of
secondary and tertiary referrals would have been rendered more difficult to achieve in the
absence of interventions to improve efficiency and effectiveness in health care provision and
management at those levels. The need to forge closer links between communities and hospitals
that can provide higher level curative care would not have been addressed. Furthermore, the
private sector is very little developed outside the capital city of Dakar to have a significant
impact on the health status of the population in general. The first priority is to improve those
services most likely to be utilized by the poor while at the same time creating a favorable
environment for the private sector to grow. A classic investment operation would have
perpetuated a fragmented approach to health care delivery and would have left many of the
critical broader issues facing the sector unanswered. This is equally true for donor coordination
and complementarity.
Lessons Learned from IDA experience
1.52   In 1991, the Senegalese Government received a IDA credit (2255-SEN) in the amount of
US$ 35 million to finance a multi-sectoral human resources development project (PDRH1). The
project health component, implemented in the three regions of Dakar, Thies and Diourbel, has
successfully tested the acceptability of generic drugs and has demonstrated the willingness and
ability of communities to pay for health services and manage cost recovery schemes. If demand
is accurately assessed and accountability measures introduced and monitored, cost recovery rates
for services can grow very quickly. Within five years, decentralized health care facilities and
their health committees are recovering an average of 120-130% of recurrent costs apart from
salaries and amortization of infrastructure. The project also highlighted the difficulties in
dealing with human resources management issues including the redeployment of personnel in the
absence of greater decentralization of health system management and broader civil service
reform. Key lessons in this area include: (a) the need for concrete human resources management
measures to be taken up in the dialogue on civil service reform and public sector modernization;
and (b) the importance of building up the capacity of the central administration to redefine its
role away from direct control and management toward strategic and support functions. The



17
progress of primary health care reform has not been matched in the hospital sector, plans for
hospital reform have been consistently delayed since the early eighties. Consequently the
hospital sector has been faced with inadequate funding and weak management and quality of
services. The recent political and administrative decentralization reforms in the country, with
the institution of the region as a political and administrative entity with greater financial and
management autonomy, has provided an impetus to reform, in the hospital sector. The impact of
changes initiated under the PDRH1 project and the sectoral studies it helped finance, have
enhanced the Bank's policy dialogue with Government on health sector development. It has also
paved the way for significant reforms in health financing, and the development of a
comprehensive framework for improving health system management, decentralized
management, human resources development, and the promotion of health insurance. The cost
recovery achieved under the PDRH1 project has permitted concrete incentives at the community
level; hence, the delay in overall civil service reform is mitigated in this area.
1.53  In the population field, findings from the recently conducted DHS confirm the need to
focus IEC activities on specific target audience requirements, expand contraceptive method
availability and improve the quality of family planning services. Addressing key beneficiary
groups with demand-driven IEC and service delivery programs within a broader reproductive
health approach which emphasizes women's health and counseling can be extremely effective in
an environment where cultural prohibitions are prominent. In addition, significant lessons for
future project work and policy reform can be learned from studies and surveys funded under the
investment operation. Five major studies were financed under the IDA credit to establish a basis
for comprehensive national policy dialogue on key sectoral issues. Findings and
recommendations formulated under these studies as well as the Bank sector report on health
financing in Senegal has guided the Bank's policy dialogue with the Government and other
donors and has speeded-up the design and preparation of the interventions proposed under this
program.
1.54   Experience was also drawn from implementation of ongoing IDA sector investment
programs in Zambia, Mozambique and Tanzania and the findings of a study of these operations
commissioned by the United Kingdom's ODA and undertaken by the Oxford Policy
Management Institute Recommendations include: strengthening the links between sector
expenditure programs and the macroeconomic framework; establishing forms of conditionalities
to support SIPs that link the assistance provided to performance in a flexible yet well defined
manner; strengthening mechanisms for measuring sector performance; and strengthening the role
and involvement of the central coordinating ministry, especially encouraging greater
accountability for public funds against sector performance and improving the management
framework and in tackling problems of incentives within the civil service.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
1.55   Measures to introduce a decentralized approach to the provision of integrated primary
health care have stood up well. Lack of drastic improvements in the management and delivery
of secondary and tertiary level health services could, however, lead in the near future to further
pressures and deterioration in the standards of hospital care, which in turn could jeopardize the
entire viability of the public health system. The issues facing the sector are systemic and require
a broader systemic response. The more comprehensive and synergistic approach to health
services development under the proposed program would provide for public funds to be more
effectively targeted to the poor and vulnerable population and would help alleviate the burden on
limited public resources by radical reform of some of the programs that are part of the public



18
health safety net. Beyond efficiency gains, better integrated ambulatory, hospital and emergency
care and laboratory services for a defined catchment population, would improve functional links
between facilities and provide a higher level of continuity in health care than currently exists.
Many components of the program have financial requirements that are beyond the capacity of
local resources or those that can be mobilized through the international donor community. In
addition, the general decentralization reforms underway, which promote local financing and
management, have created opportunities as well as challenges for improving district
management. The Bank has played a major role in strengthening district health systems under
the recently completed PDRHI project. Other donors, as well as the Government have
expressed interest in having the Bank continue to play a major role in health sector development,
finance and organizational reforms. Current IDA investments in the Human Development sector
in Senegal include four ongoing operations which will directly or indirectly contribute to the
objectives of the proposed program. They are: (a) the Human Resources Development Project
(PHRD2 for primary education) launched in FY 94; (b) the Community Nutrition Project, FY95,
(c) the Pilot Female literacy Project, FY96 and (d) the Endemic Disease Control Project FY97.
The proposed IHSDP operation, in turn, will contribute to human development by moderating
the fertility rate and improving the health status of the population in general. In addition, the
Government's strong commitment to further reformns in the field of health and population
provides an excellent opportunity to simultaneously improve the efficiency of the health system,
the quality and extent of health care services equity as well as contribute to fertility decline and
population growth reduction.
The Country Assistance Strategy
1.56  In the health sector, the thrust of the Bank Group's CAS discussed by the Board on
February 16, 1995 is still very relevant. The strategy has resulted in greater programmatic
emphasis on primary health care, preventive services and community participation in health
financing and management. Preparation of a new participatory CAS is planned for early
FY98. The Bank and IDA assistance strategy in Senegal supports the Government's aims at
liberalizing the economy, reducing the size of the public sector, fostering private sector
development and supporting social sector development. High priority is given to support of the
social sectors, particularly the Government's health strategy of improving the overall
effectiveness of the health system through further reforms, and the consolidation of the gains
achieved so far. The Government is also increasing its effort to prevent the spread of AIDS and
to reduce fertility. Its policy in education and health are complementary and reflect the
important linkage between girls' education, child health improvement and fertility reduction.
Furthermore, the increased focus on better management of public expenditures with emphasis
on health financing reforrn and the development of community-managed health insurance
schemes will contribute to meeting the goal of sustainable development and of improving the
quality of life and the earning potential of the poor. In all these areas, the IHSDP would
significantly advance the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy.

II. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
A.    PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY
Development Objectives
2.1   The IHSDP's primary objective is to help improve the health status of the Senegalese
population and accelerate the country's demographic transition toward slower population growth.
The program will pursue the above objective through the support of policies and investments
designed to improve the quality, access, and sustainability of health delivery systems. The
program will support Govemment's efforts to: (i) expand access to primary health care and referral
services to the majority of the population; (ii) improve the quality efficiency and effectiveness of
health care provision including reproductive health information and services; and (iii) strengthen
the MHSA institutional capacity to efficiently organize, monitor and evaluate health services.
Major program long range outcome would include: (a) a significant reduction of the morbidity and
mortality caused by poor preventive and curative treatment particularly among women and
children; (b) an increased prevalence in the use of contraceptive methods nationwide; and (c) more
cost efficient and better managed public health facilities.
Program Strategy
2.2   The program is systemwide in scope and calls for major improvements at all levels of
the health system for a total cost of US$410 million over the five-year plan (1998/2002). It is
also nationwide covering interventions in all regions and districts. A substantial share of
expenditures will, however, be directed to priority activities in areas such as primary health care
and first level referral. The bulk of the program financing will come from Government (US$220
million) and private internal resources (US$67 million) for incremental costs and from donor
agencies for investments. Donor funding under on-going and anticipated donors' contributions
is estimated at US$58 million equivalent. To fill the remaining gap, Government has requested
IDA financing in the amount of US$50 million equivalent, in addition to the US$14.9 million
already made available in support of the IHSDP under the Endemic Disease Control project (CR.
2951).

NB: The different scales for the operating expenditures and investment are due to the greater
proportion of budgetary allocations to the former.
2.3    The program will be implemented through a series ofjoint annual agreements based on
assessment of previous years performance and operational plans and budgets based on priorities
and established eligibility criteria for access to program funding. This procedure will allow
Govemment, IDA and other financing institutions to adjust to changing conditions and
performance thereby building in a higher level of flexibility which will allow for more realistic
planning on a year by year basis. There will be five such annual agreements each covering one
fiscal year from 1998 to 2002 and each summarizing the detailed individual agreement for
specific categories of expenditure. Agreements and financial plans for each fiscal year will be
presented to all concerned parties three months before the beginning of Senegal's fiscal year on
January 1 st. The operational plans will comprise all capital and recurrent expenditures as well as
implementation plans that describe in detail program activities including measurable targets to
be achieved during the fiscal year. IDA Credit funds would complement other donors financing
under any of the IHSDP expenditures categories provided that IDA is satisfied that all priority
expenditures are fully covered. Government has prepared a three-year rolling plan for the
IHSDP financing and has developed detailed work programs and budgets for the initial two years
of the IHSDP implementation plan (see Annex 3).
(a)    The Reform Program.
2.4   Priority measures to be implemented at the inception of the IHSDP consist of the
reorganization of the MHSA, and reform of the hospital and pharmaceutical sub-sectors. The
new organizational chart of the MHSA ( Annex III) provides a greater coherence in the design
implementation and supervision of health interventions under the different strategic priorities by
which the new public health mandate is defined. The reorganization of the MHSA coincides
with the implementation of the Government's regionalization policy and is an essential aspect of
the redefinition of the responsibilities of the medical regions and districts and the central
administration in the implementation of the health policy. Draft hospital legislation has been
prepared and will be submitted to the National Assembly along with a proposed statute for
autonomous public health establishments which will apply to specific public health institutions
such as the major hospitals, PNA, the blood bank, and the national quality control laboratory. A
large-scale debate involving all stakeholders was organized around the reform program as part of
the NHDP preparation process and allowed for the concerns of all parties to be addressed. Under
the proposed law, public hospitals will enjoy managerial autonomy and will have an
Administrative Council directed by the President of the Regional Council. The Hospital Law
will provide for a more efficient classification of hospitals, according to their technical level and
their positions in the health care pyramid, and also based on their status as public, community,
or private institutions. Control of the quality and standards of health services by beneficiaries
will be assured through their participation in the management and consultative structures of these
institutions. IPMs and the MHIAs will play major roles in quality assurance of hospital care
through contractual arrangements for health care delivery to their members. Government
subsidies will be earmarked for specific interventions and to safeguard equal access to services.
To a large extent, maintenance and operational costs will be covered through the setting of
appropriate user fee structures, and accounting systems will evolve from public to private sector
norms.
2.5    Reforms of the pharmaceutical sector cover: (i) the status of the PNA which will become
an autonomous institution; (ii) the establishment of an updated list of essential drugs by level of



22
care; (iii) a revised pricing structure for generic drugs; (iv) the use of WHO's drug certification,
and registration of the drugs' countries of origin to facilitate the import of generic drugs; and (v)
the reinforcement of quality control and inspection. The implementation of these reforms and the
execution of the recently adopted May 1996 law, authorizing the right of substitution between
specialty and generic drugs to pharmacists, is expected to result in further cost reduction which
will contribute to improving the access of the population to quality drugs at affordable costs.
2.6    Other reforms include revision of the status of health committees and the creation of a
legislative and regulatory framework for MHIAs. They seek to make these entities more
efficient in their interventions through: (i) the expansion and diversification of their activities;
(ii) the improvement of their management practice, board composition and renewal; and (iii)
their involvement in the decision making process at the sectoral level in health and social action.
Likewise the MHSA will coordinate with the Ministry of Labor in the establishment of a
rehabilitation program of IPMs.
(b)   Improved access to and quality of public health services
2.7    This would be achieved within a continuation of the decentralization process, through
the consolidation of the PHC package and reproductive health at the health post level, the
establishment of complementary referral systems including better management of pregnancies
and obstetric care, better monitoring and evaluation mechanisms and sound management
information system. The objective of the MHSA to increase access is based on the ratio of one
health post per 10,000 inhabitants. This is not far from the current national average ratio of one
health post per 1 1,000 inhabitants. However, there is a major disparity between the coverage of
densely populated poor urban areas and sparsely populated rural areas. The emphasis will be on
the creation of urban health posts over the next five years. The health mapping survey calls for
the construction of 245 new health posts between 1998 and 2002. The financing of this
component will be covered to a large extent under the local administration budget and by
municipalities. Regarding district health centers, although they are not emphasized in the
NHDP - except for the regions of Kolda and Ziguinchor - many need to be refurbished and
would require an adequate operation and maintenance budget. Based on the district and regional
health development plans the IHSDP calls for the renovation of 1 1 health centers and the
construction of 3 new ones. Three regional hospitals (Diourbel, Kolda and Zigunchor ) are
slated for renovation and construction as well as a National Center for Blood Transfusion. Up to
two tertiary health development plans would also be financed under the program, as well as
essential renovation of the social action infrastructures (CPRS and CRAS). Total costs for
renovation, construction, and equipment for district regional and national hospitals and the
renovation of the central administration facilities will amount to an estimated CFAF 60 billion.
Investments in PHC and first level referral facilities represent 85% of the total estimated cost for
health facilities. Financing would be provided by the French Cooperation and the E.U. in the
region of St Louis, by KFW and Belgium in the region of Diourbel, by AfDB in Tambacounda
region and in some districts of Kaolack and Fatik regions, by JICA in Thies, the IDB in Kolda,
Taiwan and France in the region of Ziguinchor. The NDF has agreed, in principle, to finance
sterilization equipment on a nationwide basis. The IDA credit will cover construction, renovation
and equipping of facilities in the priority regions of Dakar, Louga, Fatik and Kaolak.
2.8    On essential drugs, the master plan for the development of the pharrnaceutical sub-sector
focuses on improvements in the production, procurement and distribution of drugs by both the
public and private sectors and the rationalization of prescriptions. Under the plan, newly



23
constructed health facilities will receive a one time grant of generic drugs to set-up their cost
recovery schemes.
2.9.   Other components of the strategies designed to improve quality of services include: (i)
academic and continuing training; (ii) the development of operation research; (iii) the expansion
of Information Education and Communication activities; (iv) the development of partnership
with the private sector and NGOs; and (v) the promotion of hygiene and sanitation.
2.10   Although extensive research has been undertaken in Senegal, the utilization of research
findings remains limited and not adequately monitored because of the lack of a coordination
structure. A scientific committee will be constituted and will be responsible for identifying and
monitoring key research activities and establishing eligibility criteria for use of MPHSA funding.
The objective is to organize research teams around existing areas of competencies, foster
collaboration with specialized institutions in Senegal and abroad, and disseminate results and
potential applications throughout the health system and to all concerned parties. In order to
accomplish these objectives, funds will be set aside for research in the MPHSA recurrent budget.
It is expected that the share of research would reach a minimum of 0.5% of the total MPHSA
budget by 2002. Health care unit cost, cost effectiveness analysis, institutional development and
decentralization are among priority topics for research, along with health care management and
delivery systems.
2.11  In the preparation of the IHSDP, special attention has been paid to the role that non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) can play in program design and implementation. More than
250 NGOs ( broadly defined) are very active in Senegal in programs targeting poverty reduction
and 35 of them are in the health sector. More than half of all development NGOs in Senegal are
members of an umbrella organization "Conseil des Organisations Non Gouvernementales
d'Appui au DJveloppement" (CONGAD). Created in 1982, CONGAD is recognized by the
government and donor agencies as the main interlocutor and source of information regarding
government and NGO relations and sectoral coordination.
2.12   The government of Senegal has clearly stated its commitment to involve NGOs in the
provision of health and family planning information and services to the communities, and to
create optimum conditions for their participation in the design and implementation process of
health activities. Under contractual arrangements with the MPHSA, NGOs would be delegated
the responsibility to conduct specific activities for which the public sector does not have a
comparative advantage. During the IHSDP preparation process, and for the first time in Senegal,
the "F6deration des Associations pour le Developpement du Fouta Djallon" (FAFD) a local
well-respected NGO, was recruited by MPHSA to carry out the beneficiary assessment.
2.13   Large consultations and seminars were also carried out between MPHSA and NGOs in
the health sector with the primary objective of creating a partnership framework for NGOs'
involvement in the SIP. The IHSDP will rely on NGOs to contribute to the execution of the
following components on a contractual basis: reproductive health, nutrition, AIDS prevention,
family planning, health center management, creation of MHIAs, training of partner NGOs and
community health providers. NGOs members and non members of CONGAD specialized in the
health sector have decided to create the Health, AIDS and Population Network (Annex VI) in
order for CONGAD to work in an orderly fashion with the MPHSA. The Network will be the
link between the IHSDP coordinating unit and CONGAD and will have the following functions:
*   to facilitate policy dialogue and partnership between NGOs, the program and
donor agencies;



24
*   to promote eligible NGOs' participation in the implementation of the IHSDP;
*   to strengthen capacity in NGOs and communities to promote and sustain
quality health services and management;
*   to develop a database and survey on NGOs active in the health sector and;
*   to develop indicators to evaluate NGOs performance in IHSDP
implementation.
2.14   NGO members of the network will directly work in partnership with the regions and the
districts within the PDDS, the PRDS, and the NHDP frameworks taking into account the needs
and priorities of the communities. The IHSDP will make available an estimated amount in the
equivalent of $ 3.5 million for the financing of the NGO projects to implement innovative
approaches to meet the health and family planning needs of communities. The IHSDP
contribution will finance equipment, medical and non medical supplies, community health
workers, IEC, Women's Group health related activities and operating costs. The IHSDP Support
Unit (SSU) will be responsible for monitoring the disbursement of funds through "conventions"
which will set forth the conditions and modalities of NGO interventions. An NGO liaison office
within the SSU will be responsible for working with the NGO network and facilitating its
members' participation in program implementation. Guidelines for MPHSA/NGO cooperation
are provided in Annex III.
2.15   Because of the low level of awareness about waterborne diseases and their being a major
source of disease among the population, particular emphasis will be placed on IEC activities and
prevention. The IHSDP proposed activities in this area focus on the following key elements:
*   The development of appropriate low-cost technologies for the promotion of
latrines, and safe drinking water, the establishment of small entrepreneurs for
the collection, treatment and transformation of waste;
-   The coordination and integration of multi-sectoral interventions in sanitation
and hygiene and preventive care including the development of close
cooperation with municipalities and NGOs;
*    Strengthening existing hygiene control units at all levels of the health system.
(c)   Improvements in the management and delivery of RCHprograms
2.16   The new approach to Reproductive and Child Health adopted by the MHSA consists of
an integrated package of services which covers the prevention and management of unwanted
pregnancies, essential pre-natal and post-partum care, child survival, and the prevention and
treatment of reproductive tract infections. Four priority target groups have been identified as
follows:
Children 0-4 years: activities will focus on increased vaccination coverage, exclusive breast-
feeding and good weaning practices, nutritional recuperation and supervision, and ORT to
combat diarrhetic diseases;
Women in their reproductive age: activities include pre-natal care, pregnancy monitoring,
vaccination, supervised deliveries and post-partum, management of pregnancy complications,
nutrition deficiencies linked to pregnancy, promotion of family planning, and prevention and
treatment of RTI/ STDs and infertility; and
Adolescents: prevention of sexual mutilations and undesired pregnancies and abortions, and the
struggle against STDs/AIDS.



25
2.17   The IHSDP calls for the following activities: (i) improve coordination between the
different components of the reproductive health program through the establishment of an
appropriate institutional context; (ii) constitute a national multi-disciplinary team to train
trainers; (iii) develop integrated training modules in family planning for the health post and
district levels; (iv) adapt the FP information system to account for the different components and
their respective indicators; (v) introduce an integrated approach to childhood diseases
management in the minimum package of health care services; (vi) develop an advanced strategy
for prenatal care and child vaccinations in rural zones; (vii) reinforce, throughout the health
system, the provision of an integrated package of services for women health care needs; (viii)
apply the national IEC plan for reproductive health; (ix) assure coverage of adolescents through
family life education; (x) apply the Reproductive Health component of the National Training
Plan.
2.18   Implementation of reproductive health activities requires the development or adaptation
of integrated training modules based on already tested diagnostic and treatment protocols,
integrated supervision and an information system with integrated data processing capabilities.
The IHSDP reproductive health component will include activities targeted at maternal and child
health, nutrition, and HIV and STDs prevention. This would be achieved within an improved
primary health care system through: (i) targeted multimedia campaigns; (ii) training of
physicians and other health workers in FP and maternity care; (iii) provision of outreach services
and supplies to underserved communities; and (iv) better management of obstetric care at district
level hospitals Primary health care. Quantified utilization targets have been agreed for each
district and will be used for the annual reviews.
(d)    Strengthening the MPHSA institutional capacity
2.19   This would be achieved through management training, the recruitment of additional staff
to reinforce the technical and managerial capacity of MPHSA at all level of the health system
and consulting services with emphasis on the development of competencies. The program will
provide support for the human resources development strategy to ensure efficient human
resources management through the use of a computerized personnel information system; and
implementation of the National Training Plan (1.36% of the IHSDP). A comprehensive
medium-term training plan will be implemented to reinforce the capabilities and skills of the
MPHSA technical and management personnel at all levels of the health system. The training
plan translates the manpower needs of the MPHSA into a well integrated basic and continuing
education program which will articulate the education-employment interaction in the health
sector, including the private sector. The program will build the MPHSA central and regional
capacity to effectively support district health operations. This support will focus on program
financial and human resources management within the framework of the administrative
decentralization reform.
2.20   A long term recruitment policy has been designed to increase the number of health
employees through the efforts of the MPHSA (an agreement was reached with the Ministry of
Economy, Finance and Plan for the recruitment of 250 new employees each year, until 2001),
regions, local government, and communities. In addition the MHSA has undertaken a major
reorganization of its central administration to better integrate operations, improve efficiency and
strengthen the monitoring and evaluation capacity of central entities (Annex III). The
Administrative and Financial Directorate (DAGE) which will play a major role in overseeing the
SIP financial and budgetary management will be reinforced with new recruitment and seconded
personnel from the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Plan. The DAGE will be assisted by a



26
consulting firm during years one and two of IHSDP implementation to establish a computerized
financial management system to enable it to efficiently monitor budgetary allocations under all
categories of expenditures at all levels of the health pyramid. The new organizational chart also
provides for the creation of a new directorate of hospitals, the establishment of a SIP monitoring
and donor coordination unit within the minister's cabinet and the reorganization of the
Directorate of Public Health (DHSP). Regarding the latter, activities for strengthening and
improving its managerial capacity are covered under the IDA funded Endemic Disease Control
Project with a focus on integration of previous vertical program at primary and first level referral
care and the development of a sector wide Management Information System.
2.21   Institutional strengthening activities also include financial and technical support toward
the reorganization of MPHSA, the reorganization of health committees, the development of
Mutual Health Insurance Associations and hospital and pharmaceutical reform. On the latter,
activities comprise mainly technical and logistic support to assist hospitals in the preparation of
their development plans and charter projects; the development of management tools and training
in hospital management. The pharmaceutical reform package includes training for health
provider in prescription of essential drugs; the promotion of generic drugs import and
distribution by the private sector, and awareness building among the population about illicit
drugs.
2.22   The status of Comites de Sante will be revised to take account of regionalization, the
new status of the PNA and the development of MHIAs. Activities will initially focus on the
strategy of extending the interaction of health committees in PHC and district health system
beyond cost recovery, toward a more participative management process which will involve
health committees in the identification of health problems in their communities and increase
their role in prevention services and in health supporting sectors such as water and sanitation,
and nutrition, using support of the health committee resources generated under cost recovery
mechanisms. The strategy will also encourage the creation of a federation of health committees
to reinforce solidarity mechanisms among them and to provide management support and training
to committee members. At Negotiations, Government has provided assurances that the current
legal status of health committees will be revised to ensure women and younger men participation
and that at least 50% of existing health committee will be renewed during the first two years of
program implementation through an election process at community level.

27
From 1986 to 1993, work on the SIG focused on standardization of supports (modules, registries
and reports) and health indicators, as well as the testing of the system in 10 districts. In 1994 and
1995, the SIG was implemented in the remaining districts with the support of UNICEF, USAID
and Italian Cooperation Agency.
2.24   Since 1994, in parallel with the SIG implementation, MPHSA launched a
computerization process including the use of the GRESIB software to monitor progress on the
Bamako Initiative with the support of UNICEF; (i) the processing of data provided by health
posts by the SIG using the software SANTE and digitalized cartographic representation of
certain indicators in the context of implementation, in the river region, of a Geographical
Information System (GIS) with the support of WHO; (ii) monitoring indicators for family
planning with technical assistance from USAID; and (iii) the development of a hospital
information system with technical assistance from Cooperation Francaise. Below is a list of all
current MPHSA information systems:
*    SIG
*    Monitoring (GESIB)
*    Cartographic epidemiological information system
*    Family planning (USAID)
*    Automation for hospitals (Cooperation Francaise)
*    Maintenance Information System
2.25   Under the EDCP, the new system will seek to integrate these different networks at all
three levels of the system (district, regional and national). The integration process will allow for
automated; (i) collection of data; (ii) distribution of data; (iii) maintenance of network centers;
and (iv) electronic messaging. Training will be provided to computer operators at the district,
regional, and central levels and the software package will be integrated throughout the system.
Mobilization of Private Resources
2.26   IHSDP will increase in the Government's health budget by 0.5% per year to reach 8.4%
by the year 2002. Approximately 19.7% of the costs will be borne by the communities and
Comites de Sante through increased contribution from collectives and improved cost recovery
mechanisms, respectively. Program financing would consist essentially of support to the
promotion of MHIAs through the development of a legal framework for MHIAs, the
establishment of management and technical support mechanisms, the organization and financing
of a council to support training and the framework established by NGOs and the MPHSA, IEC
and social marketing activities.
(e)    Reorganization and reinforcement of epidemiological surveillance
2.27   Although the fight against malaria, onchocerciasis and schistosomiasis has been
institutionalized in the struggle against major endemic diseases and incorporated into ongoing
national programs, with the exception of schistosomiasis, there has been little coordination
among them. The responsible parties, the methods of surveillance, the information systems used
for monitoring and the donors are different for each program. The new program for endemic
disease control will allow better integration of information and activities by targeting first
malaria, schistosomiasis and onchocerciasis and the integration of the information system. This
program has already been developed and IDA support, provided under the Endemic Disease
Control Project (Cr. 2259-SE) which forms part of the IHSDP, and would be integrated in its
implementation.



28
(I)    Improvement of the quality of life of deprivedfamilies and vulnerable
social groups
2.28   The low standard of living of poor families determines, to a great extent, the fate of
vulnerable groups, particularly children in difficult situations, the elderly, and handicapped
members of the population. Segments of society prone to social scourges like drug abuse,
prostitution and delinquency are also especially vulnerable. To address these issues the IHSDP
proposes a multifaceted strategy involving a multi-sectoral action plan against poverty, training,
research and IEC activities. Accompanying measures include a package of legislative and
regulatory reforms and strengthening of central regional and district capacity.

Sources of funding.
3.2    Foreign Exchange Costs. The foreign exchange component (direct and indirect) of
US$59.1 million or about 38.1 percent of total estimated program cost was estimated as follows
for each type of expenditure: (i) civil works 18.4 ; (ii) Goods (equipment, generic drugs and bio-
medical material, vehicles) 17.7; (iii) studies, research activities, consultants, and scholarships
2.6; (iv) local training, seminars, and workshops 0.8; and (v) salaries for contractual staff,
logistics, supervision and maintenance 19.6
3.3    Taxes. Total program costs include local direct and indirect taxes on supplies procured
locally. These taxes are included in the program cost. Direct imports and consultants fees would
be exempt from tax and duties.
B.    IDA CREDIT FINANCING
3.4    The proposed IDA credit in the amount of US$50 million would finance 100% of foreign
costs and 95% of local costs and 20% of eligible recurrent costs financed by the Govemement at
regions level, representing 12% of total IHSDP costs. IDA credit funding will be provided under
two major components as follows: (a) Improving the health and reproductive outcomes of the
poor; (b) enhancing the performance and sustainability of health care systems.
3.5    Under the first component, the credit will support the following category of
expenditures: (a) the construction, renovation and equipping of up to 50 health posts and 3
district health centers in the regions of Dakar, Thies, Louga, Fatik and Kaolak; (b) the
procurement of an initial supply of generic drugs, vaccines and contraceptives for all newly
created facilities to set up their cost recovery system; (c) vehicles, office furniture, equipment
and supply. Credit funds will also be made available by beginning of program year three to
finance up to two tertiary hospital development plans. Eligibility for financing health posts will
be the establishment of a health committee representing at least five thousand inhabitants and up
to 10,000 within a radius of 5 Kms, evidence of health facilities' mapping including all actual
and planned constructions and a minimum of one community managed health insurance
initiative for the new or renovated district health centers. Hospital Development Plan including
new charter and board composition, management organization and financing plan and evidence
of at least one contract with a health insurance scheme as well as the establishment of a
preventive maintenance system will be required for the eligibility of hospitals to IDA credit
funding.
3.6    Under the second component, support will be provided to rationalize staff deployment
and improve financial and manpower management. In the area of reproductive health, funds will
be made available to strengthen local capabilities to plan, manage, coordinate and evaluate the
reproductive health program. Support will also be provided for the promotion of mutual health
insurance schemes and health committees to help the health system capture household
expenditures at the community and district levels and to combine public and private resources
into an equitable and sustainable financing framework for secondary and tertiary curative care.
The credit will cover the following expenditures categories: (a) technical assistance for program
design supervision and management, training, studies and audit; (b) operating costs at the
central and regional level and NGOs activities.

3.7   Program Sustainability. The estimates underlying the IHSDP are considered the most
probable and least estimates The scenario retained was the PFP-scenario- based on the macro
economic forecasts for growth, Government revenues, employment ceilings and the expenditure
framework contained in the 1997-99 PFP. In addition, the estimates for Government financing
are forecast to grow at 0.3 % per year rather than the 0.5% ceiling that the Government has
committed itself to in the PFP. More efficient management of human, material and financial
resources will also enable the sector to improve the quality and reliability of services and their
cost effectiveness. The mobilization of additional financing sources through cost recovery,
community-managed health insurance schemes, and more equitable application of user fees for
curative care will help achieve the long term sustainability of the health system and provide a
valuable risk sharing mechanism among communities. (a detailed financial analysis is provided
in Annex I).

IV. IMPLEMENTATION And MONITORING
A.    IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING
Multidonor Coordination and Aid Management
4.1    Overall responsibility for coordination and management of program implementation
would lie with the MPHSA technical divisions and DAGE, which would work in close
cooperation and interaction with a small IHSDP Support Unit (SSU) which will be established at
the Cabinet level of the MPHSA to oversee the management of resources provided under the
IHSDP. This unit would be strengthened and maintained in its agreed upon configuration for the
duration of the IHSDP (see new organizational chart of the MPHSA in Annex. III). The SSU
would have an important role to play throughout the implementation process to identify issues
relating to donor coordination and aid management, policy reform measures, budget and
planning.
4.2    The main functions of the SSU would be to:
(a)   liaise between the borrower, technical management, beneficiary entities, and
donors, and keep them apprised of all important IHSDP matters;
(b)    provide full support and assist program beneficiary entities in resolving
problems related to IHSDP execution and deal with unexpected situations as
well as errors of omission and commission arising from lack of familiarity with
IDA and other donors procedures;
(c)    coordinate the preparation of the annual work program and associated budget of
the program and monitor its execution. This activity encompasses the
monitoring of allocation of IHSDP co-financing institutions and government
funding and, where applicable, contribution from other private sources to
various implementation entities;
(d)    coordinate the preparation of annual work programs by each implementation
entity, aggregate them into an annual work program for the program, and secure
its approval by the designated decision-making body in consultation with the
DAGE and IDA and other co-financing institutions;
(e)    monitor the execution of said work program, commitments and disbursements of
the credit proceeds by each implementation entity, and consolidate
non-objection requests and procurement matters on a daily basis with DAGE;
(f)   supervise compliance with agreed covenants and the fulfillment of the objectives
and performance indicators;
(g)    prepare exhaustive progress reports and transmit them to the decision-making
bodies and donors in a timely manner;
(h)    coordinate the program and ensure that each program implementation entity
does the same; and



34
(i)   coordinate with DAGE the preparation of the annual audit of accounts and of the
mid-term review led by the Government and conducted jointly with Donors,
NGOs and representatives of local government and communities.
4.3   The unit will be responsible for providing a report of the meetings of technical
coordinators which will be institutionalized at each level of the health system. All of these
activities will be guided by an internal SIP monitoring committee that will be composed of the
national directors. The IHSDP will provide the administrative structure support for monitoring
all government and donor activities with the health sector and within its sub-sectors--
reproductive health, hospitals, district and regional health posts and centers, health finance,
health insurance, human resources development, and will encompass the ongoing Endemic
Disease Control Project.
Participation and Partnerships
4.4    One of the innovative approaches to the IHSDP preparation was the promotion of
donors' participation and coordination in the MPHSA and NGO partnership strategy. Donors
will provide support to NGOs through the Network and through the agreed Sector Investment
Program. In the regions and at districts level, donors will work and coordinate their activities
with partner NGOs. At national level, donors are members of the coordination committee to be
set up by the MPHSA. (see annex-VI-on NGOIMPHSA cooperation).
The Planning, Approval, Implementation and Monitoring Cycle
4.5   Implementation of the IHSDP will be made to coincide with the Government's annual
planning and budgeting cycle. The preparation of regional and district Operational Plans will be
conducted during the 2nd quarter of each calendar year, based on a broad financial outline
provided by the Government and approved by IDA/donors. Preliminary Annual Work Program
and Budget (AWPB) will be completed at least four months before the beginning of the
Government fiscal year. On January I st AWPB will be assessed by IDA and other donors
during September/October of each year at the joint annual review meeting. Outcome of the
annual review meeting will include progress made against annual performance indicators and the
program of reforms, the level of recurrent and capital investment for the forthcoming year, and
detailed financing plan. The WPB will then be finalized and approved by the administration
before January 1st. As part of the planning process, the Government will communicate regularly
with IDA/donors to ensure IHSDP activities' eligibility for IDA/Donors support.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.6    Agreed performance benchmarks would be monitored by MPHSA through service
delivery and utilization data from the MIS, financial and physical data, and data from technical
quality assessments and rapid assessment surveys conducted by independent agencies or
contractors. MPHSA would provide the Bank and other donors with a semi annual progress
report including information on agreed upon indicators based on data from the monitoring
system established with support from UNICEF. The report would also provide: (a) a summary
statement on the status of execution of each program activity; and (b) a table showing
compliance with program covenants, and progress in implementing agreed policy objectives.
During negotiations, agreements would be sought on the format and content of monitoring
indicators. Quantitative and qualitative data would become available through the program as the



35
MIS system becomes operational. Separate monitoring mechanisms by each donor agency
would be avoided. Achievement of Development Objectives would be assessed through mid-
term and end-of-program evaluations. These would be based on special surveys or reports
commissioned and funded under the program.
4.7    The critical performance benchmark agreed upon for the first two years of the IHSDP
are: (a) program management staff at the SSU and DAGE to be in place throughout the period;
(b) acceptable levels of allocation under each expenditure category; (c) acceptable level of
disbursement for recurrent expenditures (% expenditure vs. allocated budget); (d) technical and
managerial staff recruitment implemented; (e) implementation of training plan on schedule; and
(f) management information system in place in all districts. For districts and regions that fail to
achieve their critical benchmarks, MPHSA would develop a plan of remedial actions with clear
understanding that failure to implement the plan would lead to reduction or withholding of funds
for activities planned for subsequent years. A set of specific performance indicators for
monitoring implementation of each of the districts health development plans have been selected.
They include the percent increase in the use of health facilities, the percent of children
vaccinated, the percent increase in pre-natal consultation and the percent increase in
contraceptive prevalence. These indicators and their source of data are shown in the annual
operational plan of each district and region. These plans are available in the program files.
Since IDA financing is aimed at supporting the IHSDP as a whole, the indicators are not tied to
specific inputs financed by IDA.
Program Management
4.8   The DAGE, in close coordination and with input from the SSU, would be responsible for
organizing and managing all procurement activities including: (a) the preparation of
standardized bidding documents; (b) the updating of the procurement plan; (c) the drafting or
quality control of specific bidding documents based on Bank/donors standard bidding
procedures; (d) calling for bids by placing advertisements as required; (e) receiving bids and
ensuring proper evaluation of bids; and (f) the preparation and supervision of contracts.
Management of civil works contracts will be delegated to a Construction Management Agency
(CMA); AGETIP was selected for the first two years and found acceptable to IDA. DAGE's role
for construction will be limited to administering contracts with the CMA, and to monitoring the
progress of the construction program. DAGE's technical unit (DIEM) composed of engineers
and technicians involved in the management of health facilities and materials will work in close
relationship with the CMA, as under the previous project, and will handle the procurement of
goods. Procurement schedules have been prepared for the construction and rehabilitation of
buildings.
B.    PROCUREMENT
4.9    A Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) was carried out in July 1994. For
the program, findings of the CPAR remain valid. In general, Senegal's procurement laws and
regulations do not conflict with IDA Guidelines. No special exceptions, permits, or licenses
need to be specified in the Credit documents for International Competitive Bidding (ICB), since
Senegal's procurement practices allow IDA procedures to take precedence over any contrary
provisions in local regulations. IDA-financed Works and Goods will be procured in accordance
with Bank's Guidelines under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995 revised in January
and August 1996). National Competitive Bidding (NCB) advertised locally would be carried out
in accordance with Senegal's procurement laws and regulations, acceptable to IDA provided



36
that: (i) any bidder is given sufficient time to submit bids (three to four weeks); (ii) bid
evaluation and bidder qualification are clearly specified in bidding documents; (iii) no preference
margin is granted to domestic manufacturers; (iv) eligible firms are not precluded from
participation; (v) award will be made to the lowest evaluated bidder; and (vi) prior to issuing the
first call for bids, draft standard bidding documents are submitted to IDA and found acceptable.
Consultant Services contracts financed by IDA will be procured in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for the Selection of Consultants by World Bank Borrower published in January 1997.

costs and procurement methods. Detailed procurement arrangements and plans are in Annex IV.

4.10     Civil Works and Goods. The majority of IDA-financed activities financed under the
Credit during the first two years (US$3 .4million or 40% of the first two-year civil works and
goods program), will be used to procure Civil Works, and Goods under ICB procedures. It is
expected that the procurement arrangements for the first two years would remain valid for the
rest of the remaining three years of the program. Standard Bidding Documents to be used for
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) will be reviewed by IDA during negotiations.

4.11   Civil Works contracts financed by IDA during the first two years (totaling US$1.4
million) covering the construction of health centers in the Fatick region would be procured
through ICB in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and
IDA Credits (published in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996).
Prequalification of contractors would be deemed necessary for contracts requiring complex
techniques and those exceeding US5.0 million. Prequalification will be launched after
negotiations, in consultation with IDA. Other civil works contracts for the construction, repair
and rehabilitation of one health center and 48 health posts in the Dakar, Kaolack and Louga
regions which are costing less than US$500,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount of
US$4. 1million would be procured through NCB in accordance with procedures described in
the Manual of Procedures and acceptable to IDA. For NCB, the CMA will maintain and update
a roster of contractors eligible for NCB, according to procedures acceptable to IDA, spelled out
in the Manual of Procedures. Contracts for small works estimated to cost less than US$50,000
per contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$0.9 million, would be procured under lump-sum,
fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three qualified domestic
contractors invited to bid by way of discounts either on the total price or on the unit prices. The
invitation shall include reference unit prices established by an engineer, a detailed description of
the works, including basic specifications, the required completion period, a basic form of
agreement acceptable to IDA, and relevant drawings, where applicable. The award would be
made to the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for the required work, provided he
demonstrates he has the experience and resources to complete the contract successfully. These
contracts managed by CMA regional field offices would mostly be for works relating to small
repair of health posts in rural areas.
4.12   Contracts for Goods financed by IDA during the first two years (totaling US$2.0
million) related to medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, furniture, office equipment, computers,
vehicles and spare parts, for hospitals, health centers and basic health services would be
procured through ICB in agreement with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits (published in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996).
Contracts for office furniture and equipment, vehicles and materials locally available which are
costing more than US$20,000 but less than US$200,000, up to an aggregate amount of
US$300,000 would be procured through NCB procedures acceptable to IDA. Pharmaceuticals
and specialized materials which could not be grouped into ICB packages and costing less than
US$100,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$200,000 over the first two years
might be procured respectively through UNIPAC and through the Inter-Agency Procurement
Services of the UNDP (IAPSO); this would be the most economical and efficient way of
procuring small quantities, in particular in case of emergency or delays in program
implementation. Small quantities of goods such as office supplies, consumable materials and
spare parts, which are normally available off-the shelf at economical prices and cannot be
grouped into packages of at least US$20,000, would be procured through prudent national
shopping, based on price quotations obtained from at least three reliable suppliers, provided that
the aggregate amount does not exceed US$ 100,000 over the first two years.
4.13   Consultant Services. Consulting services financed by IDA during the first two years
would be for: (i) studies -- architectural design, preparation of bidding documents, data collection,
accounting systems, financial management supports, and impact analysis; (ii) consultancies on
technical matters and training -- skills gap analysis, skills development; and (iii) training of health
personnel staff. Consultants financed by IDA, totaling US$7.4 million, would be hired in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants (January
1997). It will be addressed through competition among qualified short-listed firms in which the
selection will be based on Quality-and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) by evaluating the quality of



38
the proposal before comparing the cost of the services to be provided. For audits of a standard
nature the Least-Cost Selection will be the most appropriate method -- the firm with the lowest
price will be selected, provided its technical proposal received the minimum mark. Consultants
services for hospital advisory services and health financing (estimated to cost less than
US$100,000 per contract and up to an aggregate of US$300,000) would be based on Consultants'
Qualifications based only on the consultants' experience and competence relevant to the
assignment. Services for lectures and small studies which can be delivered by Individual
Consultants will be selected through comparison of qualifications among those expressing
interest in the assignment or approached directly. Single Source Selection will be exceptionally
used for the training of management staff working in hospitals and health centers. The
Government of Senegal proposed to select: (a) AGETIP as Construction Management Agency
(CMA) for the first two years; and (b) the regional management school (CESAG) managed by
BCEAO. CESAG is offering, at competitive prices, a program developed specially to respond to
specific regional conditions, based on a survey of existing staff and training needs. CESAG is
regularly receiving technical supports from highly qualified foreign organizations. They can offer
quality services at prices which cannot be obtained from foreign firms or institutions. In case of
need, after the end of the second year, selection of another CMA would be handled in accordance
with the Guidelines for the use of consulting services.
4.14   Fellowship, research grants will be awarded in accordance with the Guidelines for the
selection of consultants as described above.
4.15   Short-lists for contracts estimated under US$200,000 may be comprised entirely of
national consultants if a sufficient number of qualified firms (at least three) are available at
competitive costs. This would particularly apply to contracts for architectural and engineering
services. However, if foreign firms have expressed interest for those contracts, they will not be
excluded from consideration. The standard Letter of Invitation and Form of Contract as
developed by the Bank will be used for appointment of consultants. Simplified contracts will be
used for short-term assignments, i.e. those not exceeding six months, carried out by firms or
individual consultants. The Government has been briefed during appraisal and would receive
any additional clarification during negotiations about the features of the new Consultants
Guidelines, in particular with regards to advertisement and public bid opening.
4.16   NGO activities -- in the area of Community Health, Prevention of STD/AIDS,
Reproductive Health and IEC. The selection of NGOs (estimated at US$1.3 million over the first
two years) would be based on their Qualifications (experience and competence relevant to the
assigmnent). The package of activities proposed by NGOs would be retained on the basis of
eligibility criteria established for that purpose in the Guide for NGOs agreed upon with IDA (see
annex No 6). NGOs would sign a convention (costing more than US$50,000 but less than
US$200,000 per convention) with MSPAS. Standard unit prices based on on-going similar
contracts would be used for the purpose of determining the amount of the packages of activities.
The convention would stipulate that: (i) NGOs would receive an advance of 30% of the estimated
amount correponding to the package of activities, upon submission of claim and a bank guarantee
for equivalent amount -- valid until the delivery of services reaches the corresponding amount; and
(ii) eligible expenditures would be reimbursed at the percentage of 70% against the provision of
documentation justifying the expenses.
4.17  IDA Reviews. IDA-financed contracts, or contracts financed by other donors administered
by IDA, above the threshold value of US$200,000 equivalent for works and goods will be subject to
IDA's prior review procedures. The review process would cover about 80 percent of the total value
of the amount contracted for goods and 60 percent of the amount contracted for civil works.
Selective post-review of contracts awarded below the threshold levels will apply to about one in



39
three contracts. Draft standard bidding documents for NCB were reviewed and agreed upon with
IDA during negotiations. Bank staff will review the selection process for the hiring of consultants
proposed by the Borrower. Prior IDA review will not apply to contracts for the recruitment of
consulting firms and individuals estimated to cost less than US$100,000 and US$50,000 equivalent
respectively. However, the exception to prior IDA review will not apply to the Terms of Reference
of such contracts, regardless of value, to single-source hiring, to assignments of a critical nature as
determined by IDA, or to amendments of contracts raising the contract value above the prior review
threshold. For consultant contracts estimated above US$200,000, opening the financial envelopes
will not take place prior to receiving the Bank's no-objection to the technical evaluation. For
contracts estimated to cost less than US$200,000 and more than US$100,000 the borrower will
notify IDA of the results of the technical evaluation prior to opening the financial proposals.
Documents related to procurement below the prior review thresholds will be maintained by the
borrowers for ex-post review by auditors and by IDA supervision missions.
4.18   Modification or waiver of the scope and conditions of contracts. Before agreeing to
any material extension, or any modification or waiver of the conditions of contracts, that would
increase in aggregate its cost by more than 15 percent of the original price, the Borrower should
specify the reasons thereof and seek IDA's prior no-objection for the proposed modification.
4.19   Procurement Status of Ongoing Projects and Proposed Arrangements. National Bidding
Procedures for public sector procurement in Senegal have proven slow and cumbersome in several
past and on-going IDA-financed projects. A revised procurement code is expected to be approved by
the national Assembly; the introduction of simplified procedures and training of staff which would
accompany the issuance of the new procurement code would normally improve the current situation.
Under the previous IDA-financed project, MPHSA already gained a substantial experience of
Bank's procedures. Procurement would be managed by the DAGE which includes a technical unit
(DIEM) in charge of facilities and materials. The DAGE will be reinforced through the transfer of
personnel from MPHSA, MINFIN and staff working in the current project coordination unit. It will
also require: (i) the hiring of individual consultants and ad hoc short-term consultant services as
required; and (ii) training and support during the first two years provided by a private firm to be
selected before credit effectiveness. The DAGE will also benefit from the permanent support of a
CMA for the management of civil works contracts. Assurances were provided at negotiations that,
during annual reviews an assessment of the effectiveness of bidding procedures and performance
would be carried out as they relate to the program's procurement experience and, if necessary, that
modifications to the current procedures would be proposed that would accelerate procurement, while
still maintaining adequate control over contract awards and payments.
4.20   During negotiations, the Government submited to IDA: (a) a draft procurement plan for the
first two program years; (b) a draft Operational Manual for Program Management and
Implementation including target time periods for the various procurement phases; (c) a proposal to
select a firm to provide training and guidance to the DAGE in the area of financial management;
(d) technical specifications for specialized materials; and (e) standard bidding documents to be used
under NCB procedures for civil works and goods. During negotiations, agreement was reached on
the proper monitoring of procurement, as well as the standard procurement documents to be used for
NCB. The Government gave assurance at negotiations that it will: (a) use the Operational Manual
for Program Management and Implementation; (b) use the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for
ICB and the Standard Bid Evaluation reports; (c) apply the procurement procedures and
arrangements outlined in the above documents; and (d) review the procurement plan and
procurement arrangements each year at the annual review with IDA and other donors. The
Government will submit a final version of the Operational Manual before Board presentation.



40
During implementation, all bidding documents, bid evaluation reports, and draft contracts
transmitted to IDA for review will contain an updated copy of the procurement plan. Procurement
information will be collected and recorded as follows:
(a)  prompt recording of contract award information by the Borrower; and
(b) semi-annual reports to the Bank by the Borrower indicating: (i) revised cost estimates
for individual contracts and the total program, including best estimates of allowances
for contingencies; (ii) revised timing of estimated procurement actions, including
experience with completion time and completion costs for individual contracts; and
(iii) compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.
4.21    A detailed procurement plan for works, goods and services to be procured under the first
two years was prepared and is in Annex VII It will be reviewed during negotiations and updated on
a regular basis during annual reviews. The Government has given assurance at negotiations that it
will take the necessary measures to ensure that procurement phases do not exceed the following
target time periods:
Procurement Phases                  Maximum number of weeks
* Preparation of bidding documents   4 (12 for large contracts)
* Preparation of bids by bidders    4 (12 for ICB)
* Bid evaluation                    2 (4 for large contracts)
* Signature of contracts            2
* Payments                          4
C.     DISBURSEMENT
4.22   The proposed IDA Credit will finance a five-year investment program of a ten-year investment
plan. It will be disbursed over five years according to the categories shown in Table 14. Amounts
shown in the table represent the estimated expenditures during the first two years. Category amounts
would be updated through a reallocation exercise each year during the annual reviews.

41
(a): Estimated expenditures over the first two years (in accordance with the financing plan).
4.23   This Credit would not follow the standard disbursement profile for Senegal as
implementation arrangements are based on a five-year program. Thus, the program would not
exceed the five-year completion period, and the credit closing date would be six months after
the end of the fifth year to allow payments of last invoices for contracts completed before the
completion date. Government's counterpart funds needed for twelve months to cover the share
of investment not financed by IDA and other donors, and to make advance for operating costs to
decentralized health centers will be deposited by the government in a Program Account (PA) --
using the "Budget de Contre-Partie sur Investissements" (BCI) -- not later than January 31 each
year. Government has decided to use the BCI for the provision of all counterpart funds.
Payment by the Government of the first tranche of US$500,000 to the PA is a condition of credit
effectiveness. This amount includes amounts of disbursement categories financed under
counterpart funds, and advances to the regions correponding to the needs of a nine-month period
for training, supervision and maintenance costs under operating costs. Based on annual budgets
for operating costs, advances would be made by the PA to regional health directorates. It would
be used by the regions to make payments of expenditures -- with a breakdown by district and by
objectives. The IDA credit would resplenish the PA by reimbursing 20% of eligible operating
costs disbursed by the regions upon receipt of the necessary documentation supporting incurred
expenditures certified by the auditor, and a report on the level of execution of regional budgets
for the health sector. Few other donors have shown an interest in proceeding with the same
method. To facilitate disbursements, the government would also open a Special Program
Account (SPA) at a commercial bank in Dakar for the IDA's share of eligible expenditures. The
authorized allocation would be US$1,000,000 equivalent -- representing about three months of
disbursement. IDA would make an initial deposit of US$600,000 equivalent upon credit
effectiveness. Once payments through the SPA will have totaled US600,000, the fully
authorized amount will be paid. IDA would replenish the SPA on a monthly basis or when it is
reduced by one-third, whichever comes first. Disbursements of the IDA credit would be fully
documented except for contracts valued at less than US$200,000 equivalent for civil works and
goods, and less than US$100,000 for consulting firms (US$50,000 for individual consultant
contracts) which would be made against Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) -- for which
documentation would be made available for examination by auditors (including technical audits)
and by IDA supervision missions. All IDA expenditures of less than US 100,000 equivalent
would be paid from the SPA.
D.    ACCOUNTS, AUDITS AND REPORTING
4.24   The DAGE and the SSU would maintain separate and consolidated accounts for the
program. All program acccounts (PA and SPA) and the supporting documentation (procurement
documents, contracts, and invoices) would be maintained separately by the DAGE and be made
accessible to IDA supervision missions and auditors. During negotiations. the government
provided assurance that DAGE shall: (a) recruit additional staff with sufficient experience
before credit effectiveness to reinforce its management capacity; (b) employ before credit
effectiveness an accounting firm for a period of two years to install a financial management
system, train the personnel, and consolidate the accounts; (c) maintain records and accounts in
accordance with sound accounting practices (following International Accounting Standards); (d)
have their records, accounts and financial statements audited by independent auditors acceptable
to IDA; and (e) furnish not later than June 30 each year, certified copies of its financial
statements and report of such audits (including management letters). Auditors will visit DAGE
on a quaterly basis during the first two years. They will also express separate opinions on SOEs
and the Special Program Account (SPA), and produce semi-annual reports on technical and



42
management performance. SOEs related to operating costs at the regional level would be subject
to the certification by auditors before the proceed of disbusement from the credit or the SPA.
The contracting of auditors, on a multi-year contract, and certification by auditors that the
DAGE's accounting system is operational, is a condition of credit effectiveness.
4.25 Reporting. The SSU will submit the following reports prepared jointly by the SSU, the
DAGE and the CMA: (i) semi-annual progress reports; (ii) an annual report and a proposed
financing plan four weeks before the joint annual review and not later than September 30 each
year; (iii) a detailed progress report on technical and financial program activities not later than
four weeks before the date of mid-term review; and (iii) an implementation completion report
(ICR) three months before the closing date.
4.26   Supervision. The IHSDP would require intensive supervision during the start-up phase
when implementation arrangements would be put to the test. The first full IDA/donors mission
would take the form of a program launch workshop at least three months before the beginning of
the Government fiscal year on January 1, to establish the annual review cycle. In addition to the
first annual review meeting, two supervision missions will be scheduled during the fiscal year to
monitor progress and coordinate with Govemment and donors a mid-term review will be
conducted at the end of the 3rd year of the program life and a end-of-program evaluation will be
performed during year five of the SIP. The program will be supervised every four months the
first year, then every six months thereafter. Supervision missions will consist of field trips,
including work sites, to review financial and management practices, bidding, and payments
procedures. Supervision missions will also carefully monitor performance indcators, as well as
management capacity. A mid-term review, including a full technical and financial audit of the
program and beneficiary assessment, will be conducted no later than two years after program
effectiveness. A detailed supervision plan is presented in Annex IV
E.    ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
4.27   The program has been classified as C: "No appreciable environment impact.". The
handling and management of medical waste and hazardous materials would be assessed during
program preparation and specific recommendations for incinerators, fire protection and waste
disposal will be drawn up for implementation. All program financed construction would include
drainage, solid waste disposal and sanitary facilities. The program would thus contribute to
reducing environmental risks.



43
V. BENEFITS AND RISKS
A.    BENEFITS
5.1  Major benefits include a general improvement of the health status of the population,
lower fertility, better maternal and child health and a reduction of preventable infant and
maternal death. By alleviating disability and reducing the incidence of disease, project
interventions will contribute to the alleviation of poverty as a result of the increase in labor and
labor productivity. Because healthier parents are more likely to be providers than dependents,
their children will have a better chance to become educated and to realize their full potential.
More specifically, the program would benefit poor women and children below age 5, living in
peri-urban slums and rural areas through improvements in the delivery of reproductive health
and child survival services and by enabling couples to space or limit births. Other benefits
include more efficient and professionally managed health services, reduced reliance on the state
budget for health care financing, expanded coverage of primary health care and referral services
and increased efficiency of past MPHSA investments. Improved monitoring of health care
delivery including generic drug prescription and sale and better hospital management would all
lead to efficiency gains, contribute to cost containment and help foster higher quality of care.
This in turn is expected to significantly increase the demand and use of health services. The
mobilization of health financing resources and the organization of health insurance schemes
would contribute to the sustainability of the public health system and a greater degree of equity
in access to services. In addition, expansion of formal and informal health insurance schemes
would be brought to bear a larger share of public health expenditures, thus enabling the
Government to compensate for deficits incurred by highly subsidized services and to expand
and improve the quality of health coverage while keeping constant the burden on public finance.
Reform of the pharmaceutical sub-sector to encourage a more systematic use of generic drugs
would also lead to substantial savings in public expenditures. Institutional strengthening and
local capacity enhancement are expected to help ensure successful implementation of
decentralization as well as change in central administration mandate.
B.    RisKs
5.2  There are four main risks. The first would be a slower than expected change in sexual
and fertility behavior among the population. This risk would be alleviated to the extent possible
through more vigorous and better targeted information, education and communication
campaigns. The second risk would be the continuation of a weak implementation capacity at the
MHSA compounded by difficulties in attracting and maintaining staff in the regions. To reduce
this risk, a serie of measures will be adopted by the MPHSA, before Credit Effectiveness, for
the recruitment of technical, administrative and managerial staff at the central level, the
transfer of personnel management responsibility to the region and implementation of a
comprehensive training plan which integrated basic and continuing training. Health
management training and short term technical assistance to be provided during program start-up
and implementation should also contribute to alleviating this risk. The third risk relates to
difficulties in the devolution of health administration to local government which might slow
down program implementation. This risk will be alleviated through better articulation of the
roles of regional and local political and administrative institutions promoted by the general
decentralization reform and existing decentralized entities of the MPHSA. The fourth risk is
that continued uncontrolled increase in health expenditure and unforeseen economic difficulties
could compromise financing and sustainability of health services. This risk would be



44
minimized by limniting program interventions to essential investments and rationalizing health
expenditures and incremental recurrent costs. Management improvements and health insurance
schemes to be implemented under the program would yield substantial efficiency gains and
contribute to further reducing this risk.

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
INTEGRATED HEALTH SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM
SUMMARY OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Introduction
1.    This Annex summarizes the economic analysis that was used in the identification,
preparation and evaluation of the Senegal Integrated Health Sector Development Program (IHSDP).
The IHSDP covers the first five year period of a ten year national health development plan developed
by the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs and endorsed by donors at a May 1997 Donor Round
Table. The IHSDP aims to build on past progress by improving the management capacity and
efficiency of the public health system and increasing access to and the quality of health services.
The sector reforms which will be undertaken aim to restructure and reinforce the decentralization of
health service delivery, especially at the tertiary level, and the financing mechanisms by: (i)
improving cost recovery at all levels; (ii) strengthening emerging insurance schemes as alternative
financing sources; and (iii) promoting and reinforcing the decentralized management of service
delivery services. From an economic perspective, issues of particular importance for the economic
analysis included the impact on institutions, financial management, governance and accountability,
costs and the quality of health service inputs as well as on factors such as improvements in resource
allocation, efficiency and mobilization and equity.
2.    In the initial stages of identification and preparation of the IHSDP, economic analysis was
used to develop a strategy that: (i) was coherent with the macroeconomic framework agreed upon
with the IMF and the World Bank in the context of 1996 - 1999 Policy Framework Paper; (ii) built
on the sector priorities and policy framework developed during tiie early 1990s; and (ii) used least
cost interventions and best practice approaches that had been developed during the pilot stage as the
basis for the expansion of the district health system including, for example, the construction of health
posts, support for revolving funds for the use of generic drugs, the definition of a basic care package
and the implementation of training programs. At later stages of preparation and appraisal economic
analysis was used to: (i) determine the implications of fiscal and human resource constraints and
household affordability on the development of the most cost-effective program; (ii) estimate the total
costs and the financing strategies for the various levels of health care; (iii) clarify the respective roles
of the private and public sectors, particularly at the tertiary and drug provision level; (iv) analyze
public expenditure allocations and make recommendations for improving the efficiency and equity
for public sector resources allocation; and (v) explore and propose ways to enhance the financial
sustainability of the health sector by promoting greater community, household and private sector
involvement in the financing and management of resources. Finally, during appraisal economic
analysis concentrated on: (i) evaluating the sensitivity of the IHSDP to shortfalls in financing; (ii)
clarifying and assessing the associated risks; and (iii) defining performance indicators and the
economic analysis that will be undertaken'during the IHSDP. Priority areas include a public
expenditure review in FY98; (ii) health care unit costs and demand and utilization rates; and (iii)
the impact of decentralization on health care management and delivery sy'stems.
Macroeconomic Linkages
3.     The Economic Situation. In January 1994, the Government devalued the FCFA by 50%
and undertook major reforms to liberalize the economy and restore competitiveness. The policy
reforms pursued since early 1994 have led to a marked recovery of economic activity and a
significant improvement in Senegal's macroeconomic performance and financial position. Inflation



ANNEX 1

has been brought down from about 32% in 1994 to less than 3 % in 1996. After three years of virtual
stagnation, real GDP increased by 2% in 1994, by 4.8% in 1995, and an estimated 5.2% in 1996. As
a result of better economic policies and good rainfalls, agricultural production increased by about
11% in 1996, which had substantial positive effects on the industrial and trade sectors. Exports have
been growing more rapidly than imports, thereby leading to a reduction of the external current
account deficit from 10.3% in 1993 to 8% in 1996. The strict budgetary stance has allowed the
reduction of the fiscal deficit from almost 6% of GDP in 1994 to less than 2% in 1996. The share of
wages and salaries in total expenditures declined from 41% to 36% between 1993 and 1996.
4.    Policyframework and link to the health sector. The outlook for the period 1997 to 1999
is for continued growth of at least 4.5% on average between 1997-99. While recognizing the
vulnerability of economic performance to changes in weather conditions, the government will
attempt to accelerate the implementation of reforms to promote diversification and achieve more
sustained growth rates. In the area of government finance, the objective will be to eliminate the
budget deficit and to achieve modest surpluses thereafter so as to ensure a return to financial
viability and the sustainability of public debt. The government is aiming to contain total
expenditures and net lending from 17.2% of GDP in 1996 to 15.6% in 1999. At the same time, in
order to achieve a balanced budget by 1999 the Government aims to increase revenues from 14.9%
of GDP in 1996 to a minimum of 16.5% in 1999. Expenditure management will continue to be
very prudent, particularly with regard to the wage bill and non-priority expenditure, to allow for a
shifting of public resources to primary health care and basic education. Wage expenditure will thus
be kept within the programmed limits; no general wage increase will be granted in 1997 and
recruitment will be strictly limited to separations to keep the level of civil service employees
within a ceiling of 67,000. Priority for hiring will be given to the health sector and the government
intends to hire 250 new staff per year throughout the program. For the ministries in charge of
health, education and justice, budget procedures and appropriation requirements will be assessed in
order to move the budgeting towards an outcome budget where allocations correspond to priorities.
The government is committed to increasing the share of total expenditures to health to reach the
9% level recommended by the WHO. Over the medium-term, the government will increase
annually health's share of total public expenditures from 7.25% in 1996 reaching approximately
8.4% in 2002. The Government's recurrent budget for health was decentralized (as part of a
general decentralization reform) in early 1997, giving more responsibility to Regional Councils
and local authorities in budget management. It is anticipated that greater financial autonomy will
result in increased resource mobilization at the local level.
The Country Assistance Strategy
5.    In the health sector, the thrust of the Bank Group's CAS of 1995 is still very relevant The
Bank and IDA assistance strategy in Senegal supports the Government's aims at liberalizing the
economy, reducing the size of the public sector, fostering private sector development and
supporting social sector development. High priority is given to support of the social sectors
particularly the Government health strategy, and its key elements of improving access to primary
health care for both urban and rural dwellers, expanding prevention, and improving the
affordability of essential and generic drugs. One of the Government's concerns is to improve the
overall effectiveness of the health system and to reverse the trend of the past few years of an
increase in the share of wage outlays within the health budget to the detriment of expenditures on
equipment, supplies, and maintenance. The Government is also increasing its effort to prevent the
spread of AIDS and to reduce fertility. The Government's policy in education and health are
complementary, reflecting the important linkage between girls' education, child health
improvement and fertility reduction. The increased focus on better management of public



ANNEX 1
Page3 of 17
expenditures with the emphasis on helping ensure increased internal funding for health care
facilities also contribute to meeting the goal of sustainable development and of improving the
quality of life and the earning potential of the poor. In all these areas, the IHSD would
significantly advance the Bank's CAS.
Rationale for Public/Government Intervention
6.    The health system in Senegal is at a cross roads and there is a consensus on the need to
find better ways to manage, regulate and finance health care among all concerned parties. As in
many developing countries, health care provision is becoming cost prohibitive and the efficiency
of state owned and operated health facilities is not as high as it could be. While the private sector
exists in Senegal and is growing in importance, especially in the urban areas of Dakar, Thies and
St. Louis, it is under-developed in rural areas and beyond cost recovery for public basic care at the
Health Post and Health Center level it is unaffordable for the urban poor. Household financing of
health care has increased over the past 10 years and experience within the insurance sector while
promising is still only available to a small percentage of the population. The rationale for public
sector involvement as a provider of health services is still strong because of concerns with: (i) the
public good nature of the bulk of services that benefit not only the individual but also society; (ii)
the failure of private markets to provide adequate insurance so that curative care is available to the
poor and to minimize drug costs; and (iii) the inequitable distribution of health services between
regions and income levels. However, the involvement of the state in the health sector is evolving
towards one of partnership with the non-profit and private sector and playing a bigger role in
improving the regulatory environment as a means to facilitate non-public service delivery.
7.    One of the reform program's major strategic concerns is to increase the availability and
quality of basic health services in both poor urban and rural areas, thereby helping to improve the
health status of the population in general and raise the productivity of the working population. The
Government strategy is to reduce the deficit in health personnel, reverse the trend toward lower
expenditure on maintaining health services by increasing budget appropriations to maintenance and
supervision and increasing the efficiency of allocations within the sector. A priority will be given to
human resource development. With increased resource mobilization at all levels, but particularly at
the District Level, the government will be able to devote increased efforts and attention to
improving the access to curative level services by enhancing the referral system between levels of
care, encouraging cost containment and efficiency at the tertiary level by establishing autonomous
management of hospitals, facilitating the wider use of generic drugs in the private sector and
promoting alternate financing mechanisms for curative care.
Link to Economic and Sector Work
8.    The policy and operational framework developed for the IHSDP is a product of a series of
studies, evaluations of various pilot projects and other initiatives and widespread discussion and
consensus on priorities and approaches with stakeholders at all levels of the health delivery system
and the donor community. The economic sector work was done in collaboration with other
bilateral and multilateral donors, particularly WHO, the French Cooperation, USAID and
UNICEF. Studies initiated by MIHSA under the recently completed Human Resources
Development Project (PDRH1) for Population and Health and as part of the strategic planning
process include studies on: (i) health financing; (ii) financial simulations of the health strategy;
(iii) institutional and financial aspects of the development of the hospital sector; (iv) human
resources development in the health sector; and (v) the health insurance market. The analytical
basis for the development of the policy framework and the choice of strategic priorities was



ANNEX 1
Page4 of 17
enhanced by background work done on health status, for the Endemic Disease Control and the
Community Nutrition Project. The 1992 Public Expenditure Review, the World Bank "Issues in
Health Care Financing (Report 11059-SE) and the Senegal Household Survey (Report 12517-SE)
completed in FY93 and 94 respectively provided a solid base for the subsequent health sector
policy analysis.
9.    There has been a gradual evolution in the leadership capacity of government in initiating and
utilizing economic and sector analysis as well as in defining the policy framework and articulating
the vision on how the sector will evolve over the next decade. The government has been pro-active in
nurturing a consensus on what the priorities are in the health sector and where the government
intends to concentrate its efforts. There is not to say that there is complete consensus amongst
stakeholder on all issues. For example, one area where a strong consensus has not emerged concerns
the expansion of insurance coverage. While all agree that the potential for reducing and pooling risk
is significant in Senegal and that there has been some good experience on which to build and expand
the system (see paragraph below) there is not yet consensus by unionized labor on the role of the
private sector in this area and the appropriate regulatory framework. Nevertheless, the government
intends to improve the sustainability and management of the insurance sector under the IHSDP by
promoting mutuelles (which will be more effective in pooling risk for the urban informal and rural
populations) and the autonomous management of hospitals. The Government is committed to
restructuring the existing health insurance schemes, promoting cooperative mutuelles and has agreed
not to create a National Health Insurance Fund.
10.   Health Finance. The financial resources level of the sector are particularly low in terms
of the scope of services provided. Financial burden-sharing arrangements for secondary and
tertiary levels of care are not effectively enforced and budget allocations while increasing over the
past five year, remain low by international standards. In 1996, recurrent expenditures in health
represented 7.3% of total government recurrent expenditures. In per capita terms, (see Table 1)
total public expenditures (including internal and external investment) in 1996 was equivalent to
1.2% of GDP or $7.50 - well below the minimum $9 to $12 per person needed for the provision of
a minimum package of primary health care services as determined in the Africa Region policy
paper, Better Health in Africa.
11.  Government Expenditures. As is shown in Table 1, budget allocations have gradually
increased from 5.2% of total recurrent expenditures in 1992 to 7.3% in 1996. In real terms, total per
capita expenditures have increased significantly since 1992 (with the exception of 1994 when
expenditures declined due the devaluation of the FCFA) demonstrating strong commitment by both
government and donors to the health sector in Senegal. Three trends may be discerned in the 1990s.
The Government has succeeded in reversing the trend in public health spending away from the past
constant increase in the share of hospital costs and wage outlays toward more expenditures for
prevention and basic curative care, logistics and support systems. In relative terms, as is shown in
Table 2, the share of the hospital sector has consistently diminished, from 60% of operating budget
allocations to 40% between 1989 and 1995. Aided by the focus of external donors on primary health
care activities, the first tier system received a more equitable allocation, increasing to 32% of total
allocations by 1995.

12.   The government has also improved the ratio of wage to non-wage or operating
expenditures. As is shown in Table 3, wages declined from 67.6% in of total recurrent
expenditures in 1993 to 53% in 1996. At the same time operating expenditures increased from
30% to 45%. With respect to budget management, the budget execution rate increased from 74%
in 1990 to 95% of allocations in 1996. As well, the planning and management functions have been
delegated to regions and health districts and the Government has granted some financial and
administrative autonomy to hospitals as a first step toward a full delegation of control over their
resources.

13.   ExternalAidt  External aid accounted for 83.2 percent of the Triennial Public Investment
Plan in 1991 (TPIP) increasing to 93.4 percent in 1996. External financing for health care doubled
(152 percent increase) between 1991 and 1996 while external financing for other sectors only
increased by 60 percent. Overall external aid for the health sector has been approximately US$ 28
million per year over the last five years. The projects financed by the PTIP have been primarily for
the development of Primary Health Care. External aid covers 75% of operating costs of the health
sector (due to the large technical assistance component) with only 25% going to investments. In
1997 external aid is estimated at 12 Billion FCFA or approximately US$ 25 million.

revealed that 68% of the Triennial
Investment Plan was financed by three donors: the World Bank, UNICEF and USAID.
15.   Private Resource Mobilization. Senegal has a tradition of community contributions in the
form of user fees and other cost recovery schemes in health financing that is more developed than
that of most African countries. Private financing of health care is increasing dramatically, now
accounting for over two-thirds of current expenditures, primarily concentrated in household
expenditures at local drug dispensaries. The potential for mobilizing non-budgetary resources to
complement public health costs is significant and should be realized. Theinherent risks of
inequities in access to health care for low-income groups posed by this source of financing must be
addressed by better targeting of public resources to protect the poor and through the introduction of
lower fees and exemptions. The importance of non-public financing, coming from NGOs,
households, local communities and health committees is not easy to determine. In 1995, the total
amount of direct payments from households reached FCFA 29 billion (not including contributions
to mandatory health insurance). Estimated contributions for 1996 under local taxation were

approximately FCFA 12 billion of which Commune Urbaine de Dakar (CUD) contributed over
85%.
16.   Based on the law of 1972 amended in 1983, rural communities and communes have
regularly been required to contribute to the recurrent costs of community and district health
facilities. However, the target of 8% and 9% of the rural tax revenues which should be devoted to
health has not been reached, and, on average, the share of rural taxation that went to health
remained constant at an estimated 4% of total tax revenues with the exception of Dakar
municipality which contributed CFAF 1 billion in 1992 and typically contributes approximately
CFAF 800 million annually for the personnel and operating costs of its community health
structures, With the implementation of the regionalization.

Household expenditures on health care 1995    in 1994 and CFAF 2.2 billion in 1995. In that

Sectarian institutions    400     1.6      Government budget. This trend is greater at
the level of health posts where operating expenses (with the exception of salaries and equipment
amortization) are covered completely by revenues with a cost-recovery rate of 1.12%.
18.   Alternate Forms of Finance. Faced with increasing expenditures and demands, the
Government is looking to health insurance as a source of health care financing, but has yet to adopt
concrete legislative and regulatory measures to promote this supplement to state budget financing.
Today, about 13% of the population is covered by a modem insurance plan, of which only 6% are
civil servants. Health insurance in Senegal is an increasingly important mechanism through which
health expenditures are made. In fact, transfers through health insurance amounted to 18.6% of
total health expenditures in 1989 compared to 14.8% in 1981. Various health insurance schemes
exist in the modern private sector, but do not seem to have developed in the public sector. Informal
mutual health insurance associations exist that could be promoted to cover health expenditures.
19.   Health Maintenance Funds (Institutions de Prevoyance Maladie) cover only salaried
employees in the private sector (ca. 85,000) with a total of 500,000 beneficiaries. Total contributions
to IPMs were approximately CFAF 8 billion in 1995 with CFAF 6.5 billion in payments for health
care and over CFAF 13.5 billion billed to beneficiaries; so billings in 1995 were greater than that
year's annual cQntributions There are major disparities in IPM's administration, a lack of standards
and operations norms and weak regulatory and monitoring framework. IPMs are largely autonomous
but whereas this autonomy has certain advantages, such as their ability to fix contribution levels, the
lack of guaranty funds and the negative perceptions of the quality of public health care constitute a
serious constraint for their sustainability. With the exception of some hospital care, IPMs function
separately from the public health sector. The IPM beneficiaries' high usage of private care facilities
and the volume of their expenditures on drugs are particularly striking.



ANNEX 1
Page8 of 17
20.   A survey of 24 IPMs (approximately one fifth of the total number of IPMs in the country)
conducted in 1997, found that approximately 25% of IPMs function correctly, 25% were in poor
financial state and required vigorous restructuring, and 50% were financially vulnerable for diverse
reasons. All IPMs still have a long way to go, however, in the application of effective risk
management tools and the use of co-payments. Many IPMs have made commitments beyond their
means and without sufficient prospects for cost-recovery. This has resulted in defaults by several
IPMs.
21.   Other forms of health insurance include IPRES which protects retired employees
(approximately 135,000 in 1996) and civil servants which are covered by budgetary allocations
(primary expenditures are on medications with 80% of health costs covered by government).
Many large enterprises provide the same coverage to their employees. Although these groups are
not satisfied with the care they receive there is entrenched resistance to the idea of contributing to
their own health coverage.
22.   Mutual Health Insurance Associations (MIHAs) benefit from several preconditions that
favor their development. A political commitment to this type of self help institution has evolved as
seen in the evolution of similar organizations in the informal sector of the economy (e.g., savings and
loan associations, women's groups and organizations). There are also domestic and foreign
economic resources to support the development of private insurance associations. Senegal boasts a
per capita income twice that of other West African nations and external partners and donors have
indicated a willingness to participate in the development of private insurance associations. In
particular, momentum has been generated through the networking of MHIAs within Senegal and
with external MHIAs, notably Mutualite Francaise and Mutualite Chretienne de Belgique. In 1995,
approximately 40 MIHAs had been established, mostly in urban area. By 1997, the number had
increased to 80 although only 25% are operational. There are several constraints to the development
of MHIAs in Senegal. There is no statutory and regulatory framework specific to mutuals.
Internalization of the health insurance association concept is insufficient and Government risk
guarantees to MHIA are non-existent which limits their capacity to expand membership and ensure
long term sustainability. Also, MHIA managers lack training and experience, adding further risks to
MHIAs' financial viability. Finally, the majority of existing MHIAs until now, have paid
insufficient attention to developing partnerships with health care suppliers and providers. The
Government is committed to promoting the establishment of MIHAs aiming for a coverage of 15%
of the population and the creation of a federation of MIHAs. In the context of the hospital reform,
one criteria for hospital accreditation will be the number of contracts signed with IPMs or MIHAs.
Expenditure Framework and Financing of IHSDP
23.   Expenditure Estimates. A medium-term expenditure framework was developed for the
IHSDP, integrating the investment, wage and non-wage (operating) expenditures at the regional
and national levels for the period 1998 - 2002. The program builds on progress achieved over the
past 4 years continuing to: (i) increase the allocations of public expenditures to health; (ii)
improve the access to primary health in under-served regions and poor urban areas; (iii) improve
the efficiency of intra-sectoral allocations, particularly for equipment maintenance and thus the
quality of expenditures; (iv) reduce the deficit in health personnel; (iv) reinforce the sustainability
of health financing promote alternate financing mechanisms for curative care; and (v) clarify the
relative roles financing contributions of the various health sector stakeholders.

24.   Table 5 summarizes the composition and distribution of expenditures in the health sector
between 1998 and 2002. Under the IHSDP, investments will comprise 26.1% of total expenditures,
operating costs 42.6% and salaries 31.3%. The IHSDP calls for an increase in expenditures by
central and local governments and by local Health Committees (Comite de Sante). As is shown in
Table 6, by 2002, government financed recurrent health expenditures would account for 8.4% of total
government recurrent expenditures. Per capita health expenditures (recurrent and investment funded
by the Government of Senegal and donors) will increase in nominal terms to FCFA 4092 in 2002
from FCFA 3759 in 1996 or to $8.20 from $7.50 almost reaching the benchmark of US$9 per capita
for low-income countries. When expenditures from local government and Health Committees are
included, per capita expenditures on health under the IHSDP will reach $8.50 in 2002.

25.   Investment Expenditures. Under the IHSDP, investment expenditures are defined as
construction and equipment (including vehicles). The investment program by classification of
expenditure and level of care is summarized in Table 7. Detailed estimates for the first two years of the
program for regional level entities and at the national level were based on regionally developed action
plans and budget norms. It is worth noting that regions and districts will receive 85% of total
investments and that 40% of the investment program will improve access to primary health care at the
health post and health centers level. Regional, departmental and national hospitals will receive 44% of
total investments. Table 8 groups the investrnent program by year and expenditure category construction
represents approximately 70% of total investment of which 85% will be at the regional level. The
investment program for the national or central level, is concentrated in 1998 due to the rehabilitation of
the MHSA. For the regions, however, the investment program is spread more evenly over the 5 year
period, with a peak in 1999 marking the beginning of the hospital reform program. Investment in
equipment represents 29% of the investment program, of which 74% will benefit regional activities.

26.    Operating Expenditures are divided into two groups: (i) regular operating expenditures for
items such water, electricity, telephone, equipment maintenance and building repair, medicine and
medical evacuations; and (ii) other specific programs such as training, research and information
campaigns, surveys, initial setting up of drug supplies in health posts and centers,supervision and
monitoring. Table 9 shows the detailed breakdown of the budget estimates for operating costs for 1998
to 2002. Regular operating costs are forecast to increase by 10.7% annually, demonstrating the
government's commitment to improve the quality of services via improvements in the maintenance of
equipment as well as improved supply of consumable items. For the central administration, operating
expenditures will increase at 5% per year, much less quickly than for the regions where operating
expenditures are forecast to grow on average by 12 per year. Consequently, the central administration's
share of operating expenditures will fall from 42% in 1998 to 33% by 2002, representing a continuation
of the Government's policy of delegating responsibility for the planning and implementation of service
delivery at the regional level, with the central administration playing more of a policy setting,
coordination and supervisory role.

27.   Personnel and Wages. Improving the quality of and access to health services will require
that the current deficit of approximately 2000 health workers as well as additional staff for new
health centres be recruited. The estimates, as shown in Table 10, are based on the following
assumptions: (i) an annual recruitment of 250 health workers; (ii) local health committees will
increase their share of the wage bill (currently at FCFA 400 million) by 5% annually; (iii) regional
governments share of the wage bill will also grow by 5% (currently FCFA 850 million); and (iv)
donors will only provide short term technical assistance which will remain at FCFA 200 million
annually. Table 10 summarizes the breakdown of the wage bill by source of financing. Personnel
expenditures will increase on average by 4% per year.

28.   Sources of Financing. Financing of the IHSDP will come from: (i) the Government of
Senegal through the national and investment (BCI) budgets; (ii) household contributions through
cost recovery managed by health committees at health posts, health centers and hospitals and
insurance programs such as the IPMs and mutuelles; (iii), local government tax revenues; and (iv)
donors. The breakdown of the IHSDP by source of financing is summarized in Tables 10 and 11.
29.   Government of Senegal Participation. The government will continue to play a major role,
covering 54% of total IHSDP expenditures, providing the overwhelming share of financing for
salaries (88%), half of the operating expenditures (50%) and a significant part (18%) of the
investment budget. Under the IHSDP, the government's contribution to the health sector over the
next five years will increase. Health sector recurrent expenditures as a percentage of total
government expenditures will increase to 8.4% in 2002 from approximately 7.3% in 1996 -
approaching the Government's 9% target. Table 12 summarizes by expenditure category the
government's proposed effort under the IHSDP. Expenditures will increase on average by 7.3% per
year. Wages will grow by approximately 4% per cent per annum, less than the increase for
operating costs which are forecast to grow by about 10% per year. Investment allocations are also
forecast to grow by about 10% per annum, reversing the trend of the early 1990s when investment
from internal resources were declining. As a result, the'government will finance a significant share
(18%) of total investment under the IHSDP. In conclusion, increased budget allocations for health
demonstrate the-government's commitment to the health sector. The proposed increase in
expenditures is based on reasonable assumptions about the Government's capacity to fund the
IHSDP. Estimates for the wage bill are based on realistic assumptions pertaining to the supply of
qualified staff and are consistent with the government's hiring policies. The health sector's share of
total recurrent expenditures grows at 0.3% annually which is less than the 0.5% increase that the
government has committed itself to, represents a continuation of the trends established in recent
years.

30.   Discussions of the prerequisites, process and institution of an effective allocation of public
expenditures were initiated in June, 1997 with the Finance Ministry and the ministries of health,
education and justice as a first phase in reforming public expenditures. An objective-based budget
that unifies the current and capital budget in a medium framework is being developed by these
ministries. The reform will allow for more effective provision of public goods according to stated
priorities and cost-effectiveness criteria. The projected increase of 0.3 percent in MHSA
expenditures is consistent with the overall public expenditure program and should not have a
detrimental effect on other social expenditures. The work done by MHSA as part of the sector
investment program preparation makes it the sector most likely to implement the reform in fiscal
year 1998.
31.   Financial Contributions of Health Committees. Financial participation of households is
well established in Senegal. Cost recovery for health services is accepted and the resources are co-
managed by Health Committees and health personnel. As a result of the revenue generated by
cost-recovery, health posts, and to a lesser extent health centers, are able to cover their regular
operating costs and renew their stock of drugs. With respect to cost recovery at the health post
level, the fee structure is affordable for most of the population. Household contribution via cost-
recovery funds co-managed by Health Committees is expected to increase by about 5% annually
and will account for about 1 1% of the total costs of the IHSDP. Table 13 shows the expenditure
breakdown of health committee resources which will be used primarily to finance operating
expenditures. As is shown in Table 10, cost recovery efforts managed by Health Committees is
expected to provide 23% of total operating costs of the IHSDP. Health Committees will provide
almost 11% of the financing requirements for IHSDP, primarily for the health post and health
center level of care; 90% will go to cover operating expenditures.
32.   Role of Local Government. Financing by local governments is estimated to provide
about 6% of financing. The management and maintenance of regional hospitals and rural health
centers are the responsibility of regional government while Communes (municipal governments)
are responsible for the management and maintenance of urban health posts and centers. Rural
communes are responsible for the construction, maintenance and management of health posts.
Resource mobilization at the local level should theoretically increase given the program of
decentralization and that local governments are required by law to devote 8-9% of tax revenue to
health. However, it will most likely take a few years before the impact of decentralization will be
fully realized. The percentage of local tax resources allocated to health will increase slowly.
Consequently, it is assumed that resources from local government will grow at a similar rate as for
the central government- that is 8% on average per year. Local government's share of the IHSDP
will be about 6%, gradually increasing from 5% in 1998 to 8% in 2002. It is possible however,
that the contributions of local government could increase depending on the degree of success in
implementing the decentralization policy.
33.   Donor Involvement Donor's share of the IHSDP is estimated at 29% of total
expenditures or approximately FCFA 14 billion or $24.5 million annually which is slightly less
than the average annual external aid disbursements over the past 5 years. With respect to the
investment program, it is expected that donors will provide 80% of the financing. There will be a
more even distribution of cost sharing for operating expenditures. Donors will ensure a large share
of special program activities such as training, studies, surveys, coordination, supervision as well as
maintenance and helping to establish initial drug stocks in new health posts. Donor financing of
wages will be minimal, accounting for only 2% of total expenditures and will be limited to
providing technical assistance.

34.   Financial sustainability. Table 15 shows the expenditure composition of the IHSDP by
sources of financing. Overall the program will provide for an improved allocation of expenditures
within the sector, which will improve the quality of health services, and clarifies how the financing



ANNEX 1
Pagel S of 17
will be shared. Investment expenditures will benefit the regions, improving access to primary
health in under-served areas and the referral system to tertiary level care. There will be a more
even distribution of cost sharing for operating expenditures. As well, operating expenditures will
increase more quickly than personnel expenditures. It is anticipated that the quality of health
services will improve because of: (i) steady increases in recruitment and the posting of personnel
to under-served regions, and (ii) faster increases in operational expenditures - especially for
equipment maintenance, training, supervision and consumable items - which will result in a steady
and marked improvement in the operating to wage ratios from 1.3 in 1998 to 1.5 by 2002.
35.    Given the past experience of cost-recovery and improved service delivery, the
improvements in quality should result in increased frequency rates. At the health centre level, but
also at hospitals, cost recovery poses a problem of equity, if one goes further than just a symbolic
payment and moves towards a fee structure that covers the cost of service. In order to overcome
this problem, the country is moving more and more explicitly towards the development of
solidarity organizations via the MIHAS which aim to share risks and contain health costs as a
means to promote first tier and tertiary level referral. The government is committed to promoting
the development of mutuelles and has established a special unit to help build the management
capacity of MIHAs and extend coverage to 15% of the population. The potential for health
financing and sustainability in the future is significant. In particular, health entities will be able to
use the MIHAs which will allow them to provide quality services. In this way a partnership
between the health entities and the MIHAs will be developed, differentiating between the delivery
of health services and the financing of services. The MIHAs (and the IPMs) will play an important
role in organizing solidarity and demanding more cost-effective services from the deliverers of
health services. As part of the hospital reform, hospitals will have to enter into contractual
agreements with health insurance entities. The government will also promote the utilization of
generic drugs at all levels of the health system as a means to contain costs and improve the
affordability of health care. It is difficult to forecast how quickly mutuelles will develop. Once
the legislation is clarified and efforts put in place to help mutuelles establish and improve the
management capacity, the role could be quite important for cost containment (use of generic drugs)
and negotiating fees for certain services.

36.   Sensitivity and Risk Analysis. Potential risks impeding the execution of the IHSDP can be
grouped into two categories - those due to financial shortfalls or to weak management capacity at
the various levels of health service delivery. Possible reasons for financial shortfalls identified
include:
* a lower than forecast growth (3.5%) in total government expenditures (due to a slower than
forecast rate of economic growth or lower than expected revenue mobilization) that would



ANNEX 1
Page16 of 17
result in lower levels of expenditures available for implementing the IHSDP. A shortfall in
government revenues would have the biggest impact on the wage bill and thus the recruitment
of new personnel and for operating expenditures. A slowdown in recruitment would most
likely have an additional adverse impact on the ability of the government to send personnel to
the health posts and centers constructed and renovated under the IHSDP (as well as for those
regions currently seriously understaffed) and thus, for the poorest and under-served regions.
*  slower improvements in frequency rates and cost recovery at the health post and health center
level resulting in a reduction in the financial capacity Health Committees to contribute to the
IHDP, especially for operating costs and a thus a slower than anticipated improvement in the
quality of care.
*  donor commitments are realized more slowly than initially announced at the time of the
appraisal or, because financial constraints in donor countries result in cuts in commitments part
way through implementation. Declines in donor contributions would impact most negatively
on the program of construction of health posts and renovation of health centers and other
sanitation infrastructure targeted to the most under-served and poorest regions and of regional
hospitals and possibly training programs. The major implications would be slower than desired
expansion rates of health posts and centers and slower progress in building a referral system
between health posts, centers and regional hospitals.
37.   Potential management risks would be primarily due to the weak capacity of the DAGE to:
(i) play a central role in the operationalization, monitoring and supervision of the medium-term
expenditure framework for the health sector; and (ii) provide the quantity and sophistication of
information that will be needed to adequately monitor the IHSDP. The financial management
inexperience and lack of transparency at the local government ("collectivite") level could slow
execution rates for those budgets transferred to the regions under the decentralization policy.
38.   The likelihood of one or more of these risks occurring is low. First, on the financial
management side, the capacity of the DAGE will be reinforced by the recruitment of qualified staff
and a consulting company to provide technical assistance for the development and utilization of
modern accounting, personnel and financial control mechanisms. As well, the status and role of
Health Committees will be revised in order to enhance management capacity and financial
transparency. Second, the estimates underlying the IHSDP are considered the most probable and
least cost estimates. With respect to the cost, financing and expenditure framework estimates, the
scenario retained was the "PFP - scenario" based on the macro-economic forecasts for growth,
government revenues, employment ceilings and the expenditure framework contained in the 1997-
99 PFP. Consequently, a high-growth scenario was rejected. In addition, the estimates for
government financing are forecast to grow at 0.3% per year rather than the 0.5% ceiling that the
Government has committed itself to in the PFP. In estimating costs, least-cost investment and
other activities and cost-effective basic care packages as developed under the Bamako Initiative
and the PRDH project were used. The estimates for local government financing were less than the
8% which is mandated by law. Resource mobilization by the Comit6 de Sante was based on actual
results of the past 3 years.
39.   In order to test the sensitivity of the IHSDP to a major shortfall in financing, the impact of
government expenditures growing by 0% over the period of the IHSDP, rather than the assumed
3.4% average yearly increase, was tested. In this situation, if the level of health expenditures
forecast under the IHSDP is maintained, the share of government recurrent spending allocated to
health would need to increase to 9.7% rather than 8.4% in 2002 as estimated under the "PFP-
scenario". However, if the allocations for health relative to total government expenditure evolve as
planned under the IHSDP, the recurrent budget for health will fall. Over the planned period of the



ANNEX 1
Pagel 7 of 17
IHSDP, there would be a cumulative shortfall of FCFA 8.2 billion ($16 million). As mentioned
above the main implication would be for personnel recruitment and operating expenditures.
40.   In the case of a significant financing shortfall, risk management will center on agreeing on
a core program of activities to be maintained that would give priority to improving the access to
primary health services and improving the quality of health care. The core program would include
the construction of Health Posts and the rehabilitation of health centers, the recruitment of personal
for under-served regions focusing activities in primary health care and first level referral. The core
program would be spread over a longer period. This risk will be further alleviated through better
financial management at the central and local level, the promotion of the mutuel insurance system,
the expansion of generic drug utilization as a way to reduce health care costs and the program of
hospital reform, renovation and equipment would be delayed. The performance indicators which
would monitor risks, detect problems and provide the basis for resolution are summarized below.

k. IZtroduction                                              -
Le droit  la Sant6 est recormu par la Constitution S6n6galaise qui dispose en son article 14
que L'Etat ct les Collectivit6s publiques ont le devoir social de veiller a la san6 physique,
mor4ae et mentale de la famille
Ce faisant, l'Emat s'est engagd a assurer 1 tout s6n6galais zun 6ta de complct bimDte
piysique, mental et social, pas seulement t'absence de maladies., conform2mem  i la
de6fnition que 1'01MS donne de la Sant&.
Le Sne6gal a egalement fait sicnnes la Declaration d'Alma-Ata sur les Soins de S=-.
Primaires (SSP) en 1978 et plus r6cemment les conclusions dui Sommet de Copenbague de
1995 puur l'.61iminarion de la pauvrete. I1 a adhere a diff6rentes charmes issues de renconres
interionales parii lesquelles le Sommet Mondial sur l'Enfanpe de 1990. la Charte
Affricaiae du DIcveloppement Saitaire, le Sommet Africain de l'OUA sur l'Enfance de 1992,
la Conference Internationalc sur la Population et le Developpement du Caire de 1994 et le
Sommet de Beijing sur les Femmes de 1995.
. Apres [installation des SSP qui a et facilit6e par la Reforme Terrtoriale et Locale de 1972.
le. Go veznement a olabor6 et adopt6 en 1988 la DecIaration de Politique de Population suivie
en 1989 de la Ddclaration de la Politique de Sante.
La mise en oeuvre de ces d&clarations a permis de systdmatiser la planification a la base a
travers Li r6or5ganisation fondamentale de l'administration sanimire par l'introdrction du
-distrir.c. onomme ertit op6rationnelle.
Ainsi au :ours de la p6riode 1991-1995 couverto par les premiers PRDS/PDDS et marquee
par la mL.- en place de l'Iiitiative de Bamako, il convient de noter:
- I'adoption d'une liste de medicaments et produits essentiels;
- 1'ameIioration de la disponibilit6 et de 1'accessibilitd aux medicazents esseatiels
par Ia resructuration de la PNA;
;la prise de textes 16gislatifs et r6glementaires orgamsant les comit6s de sa6t
- I'approche £paquet minimum d'activt6s);
la consolidation du suivi du systeme d'information i la base par le monitoring.
L'expprience des PDDS/PRDS a pernis d'accroltre l'efficacit& des actions sanitaires,
daimnlioror la couvecture en infrastructures et de drainer des ressources importantes vers les
districts et Ics regions.
CcCJ explique en parie la baisse de la mortaliti infantile qui est pass6c de 68%o en 1992
(EDSII) a 60%7o en 1996 d'apres les resultats de I Evaluation des Objectifs 7nterm6diaires
(EOI 1996). En mnatiere de vacciation, le taux de couvermur  des enfants complitement
vaecin6s est passe de 47 % en 1992 a 51 % en 1996.
Cependant, 1'6valuation de ces plans a permis d'identifier un cermn nombre de conainws
reprises dans le document des -Nouvelles Orientations do la Politique de Sanw et d'Action
Socialoa 6labor.c en Juin 1995. Ces contraintes sOnt li6es a:



ANNEX m
Page 4 of 11
- l'insuffisance de la coordinaton des imterventions sanitaires et sociales
essentiellement dne A l'inadequation du cadre institutionnel;
- I'absence d'un organe central de .planification et de coordination de la Politique de
Sante et d'Action Sociale;
les difficuIt6s de coordination de 1'action des bailleurs de fonds et des ONG;
- l'insuffisance de l'implication des ONG et du Secteur Prive dans la mise en
oeuvre de la Politnque de Sante et d'Action Sociale;
- I'absence de cadre ad6quat favorable au d6veloppemeut du sous-secteur
hospitalier;
- L'insuffisance de la politique pharmaceutique nationale en matire de promotion
de m6dicaments generiques notamment dans le secteur priv ;
- la veLwst et V insuffisance des infrastructures et des 6quipemencs
- l'absence d'une v6ritable politique des ressources humaines
- 1'insuffisance du financement du systhme de sant6.
Toutes ces difflcultXs internes au secteur de la Sante et de l'Action Sociale se Erouvent
accentudes par un cnvironnemeilt conomique et social d6favorable, caracterise par des
htcteurs de pauvrec&, de croissance d4mographique continue, d'urbanisaron non co=r6rlee, de
seolarisation et d'alphab6tisation insuffisantes.
C'cst dans ce contexte que le Gouvernement du SA gal a 6Labor6 le IXme Plan
d'Orientation  Economique et Social 1996/2001 avec comme objectif prncipal UR
renforcement de la capacitd de la nation a xrpondre a la demande sociale de plus en plus
croissante par une amelioration de la competitivite de I'6conomie et un d6veloppement
humaitn durable. C'est ainsi que les orientations s=atdgiques suivaxtes ont et6 identifi6es pour:
- rendre le cadre reglernenxaire plus apte a. promouvoir une saine competition entre les
diff6rents acteurs et favorable au renforcement des investissements;
renforcer la dynaniique d'intcgration sous-regionale et la coop6ration intemationale;
- delelopper iinitiative priv6e et accompagner les mutations dans le domaine de l'auto-
organisation;
adapter 1'environnemenT financier aux besoins des diverses activit6s et favoriser
V'amelioration de l'epargne naEionale:
- ameliorer la quait6 des inrerventions de l'Etat dans la fourniture des services eE
infrastructures de base;
reniforcer le d6velpp   t.i et i'Mnt.g$i-on des Igaions;
- reTfforcer le. syst&ine dducatif, notamment la formation technique et l'education de base;
- renforcer et faciliter l'acces i. l'inforrnation et promouvoir la communication sociale;
- poursuivre la misc en valeur des ressources humaines et att6nuer les tendances
d6inographiques defavorables;
- assurer une saine gestion des ressources de 1'environnement pour un d6veloppement
durable.
ParallEIement, le Gouvernement a 6labor6 en Juin 1995 le document des Nouvelles
Orientations de la Polidique de Sant6 et d'Actiou Sociale qui trace les grandes lignes des
rdformes envisagecs dans les diffdrencs sous-secteurs de la Sante et de F'Action Sociale. A cet

Leas ressources du Programme d'Investissement Sectoriel seront orientdes prioritairement vers
[a . ealisation des objectifs suivants:
r rduire la mortalit6 infanto-juv6nile (1545 %, EOI 96) par un appui cons6quent aux actions
ax&es sur l'e1imination des naladies diarrh6iques, la malnutrition, les maladies cibles du
PEV, les IRA et autres endemies locales y compris les MST/SIDA;
- r6duire la mortalite maternelle (actuellemenrt i 510/100.000 naissances vivantes) par une
amel.oration substanEielle de la couvermre en consultation pr6natale, I'amelforation de la
qualict de la prise en charge des grossesses aux iges extremes et la rdducrion des
accouchements non assists;

enfants en siLuation difficites, des personnes agees.
1. Reorganisation du Minist&re de la Sant6 Publique et de F'Action Sociale
Au niveau cenral, les dysfonctionnemeurs constat6s ont abouti ii l'dlaboration et i la rise en
plac: d'un orgaiigramme plus fonctionnel qui se taduit essentiellnem  par:
- la' creatioh d'une cellule d'ippui i la planificacion, i la coordination, at suivi et &
levaluadon du PNDS/PIS et des r6formes;
- I'ingration  de services anciennement rattacbhs au  Cabinet dans les directions
,op6rationnelles;
- le r6am6nagement des directions pour micux les pr6parer aux nouvelles missions du
dmparEement en tenant compte de la regionalisation.

Page 6 of 11
C'est ainsi que La DirecEion de 1'Administation Citnrale et de l'Equipement du Mnist&re de
la Sant6 Publique et de 2'Action Sociale a &6c restructur6e pour prendre en compu la nouvefle
progeammation budgitaire ditc budget fonctionnel. De meme la reor Iation de la Direction
de la 3ante Publique a pr6vu la cr6ation d'une Direction G6n6rale.de la Santc qui comprendra
entre autres la Direction des Grandes End&mies, la Direction de l'Hygi&ne et la Direction de la
SanEd de la Reproduction. Cette 6volution est dict6e par la n6cessiM de prendre en charge la
iute contre la maladie, l'important programme de Santr de la Reproduction et le volet
Hygie6ne. -Pour la Direction de la Pharmacie, il a dt6 retenu de rendre autonomne le Laboratoire
zationai de Co=r6le des Mddicaments et de hli permettre de diversifier ses activirts en
direction du sccreur priv6 et de la sous-r6gion.
Par ailleirs, il va atre cree une nouvelle direction pour prendre en 'charge des activit6s
jusqu'alors cx6cur6es par des conseillers ou integr6es dans d'auires directions telles., quo la
recherche, les etudes, . la formation, la staistique at la documentation.
Au niveau p&riphbrique, la mise en oeuvre de la r6gionalisaton se traduit par un transfert de
compktences aux collectivit6s locales qui ont d6sonnais la responsabilite de la gestion da
budcet de fonctionnement et des personnels. Toutefois, la r6gion m6dicale reste rattach6e au
Cabinet du Minisare de la Santd Publique et de I'Action Sociale r.t ddveloppe une relation
fonctionnelle avec l'hOpiral rdgional.
2.' Rforme Hospitaliere
. Jmsqu'i pr6sent, le sous-secteur hospimalier n'a pas 6t6 bien pris en compte dans la
planification du syszame sanitaire. Par ailleurs, le nouveau systeme. de planification requiert
une approche plus globale du developpement de I'ensemble du secteur, d'oi la niessite de
me-ire en place une r6formc du systeme hospitalier qui va se traduire par:
- I'adoption de la loi hospitaliere qui consacre l'autonomie des h6pitaux et preserve la
misisbn de service public (continui6, 6quitd, prise en charge des urgences);
- i'6]aboration de la carte hospitali6re dans le cadre de la carte sauitaire du pays;
- 'utilusation d'outils modernes de gestion pour traiter l'information mkdicale, l'information
fmanci&re er la coAptabilite analytique;
- la mise en place d'un statut specifique aux -personuels des emblissemenEs publics
hospitaliers
l - Faboraton et la mise en oeuvre des projets d'6tablissements hospitaliers.
D'ores et dji,, des actions urgentes figurent dans le PIS, en attendqnt le daveloppemcnt des
projets dc&ablissemencs hospitaliers.
3. ROorme du sous-secteur Pharmaceutique
Las reformes du sous-secteur pharmaceutique traduites dans le Plan Directeur de la Pharmacie
visent une meilUcure accessibilit* et une meilleure disponibilir6 ainsi qu'une utilisation
ratiornnlle du m6dicament dans le cadre d'un sys3trne d'assuranzc-quali6 propre a
sauvegaxder la sdcuritd des populations.

4. R6forme du systnme.de financement du secteur
L'Elat va continuer i jouer un r6le important dans le fmlancement du Secreur. A car effet, il va
poursuiyre sou engagemant i augmenter la part du budget Sante de 0,5% par an potr atteindre
lo-bjectif de 97% en l'An 2000 conformement aux reconnandations de I'OMS.   :
Toutcfois, les d6penses de sant6 oat atreint un niveau .tel qua l'Etat n'est plus en mesure dc Ies
assume; totalement. La participation fmancitre des populations depuis 1980, dans le cadre des
Soins de Sant6 Primaires,. quoique trEs imporcante et assurant le recouvrement. des coilts des
mAdIcamerts et des prestarions de soins, a montrd ses limites. A cet 6gard, la recbroche de
Snancmeme  alternaLif s'impose pour la couvermre des risques de sant  qui n'atteint
actucllement que  25 %, d'autant plus que  la regionalisation  se taduit par %me
rosponsabilisaLion enti6re des strucues dientralisdes dans la gestion financikr aussi bian
des ressources de I'Eta: quo de celles genirres localement.
tompte tenm dc l importance de la population couverte par les Instimtions do Prvoyance
Maladies, le Gouvermement va continuer de leur. accorder une attention soutenue en suivant
l'volution de icur rcstrucruation et le renforcoment de leur gestion. De plus, dans le cadre



ANNEX m
Page 8ofll
d'une action gouvememenltae concert6e, les strucrures saitaires publiques qui peuvent 6tre
aussi performaures que le secteur prive vont s'ouvrir aux PM.
S'agissant des comitcs de santi, leur statut va 8tr6 rdvis6 a la fois pour adapter le systame aux
nouvelles, exigences de la r6gionalisation et de l'autonomie des hopitaux, et pour rationaliser
la gestion dce leurs ressources fmanci6res.
Le mouvenient mutualiste dans le domaine de la Sant6 est r6cent Mais il se beurte d6ji i
cerc.ines entraves qu'il importe de lever dans les.meilleurs deais. A cot effet, le Minis*re de
la Sawm  et de l'Action Sociale a nms en place un programme de d6veloppement des mutuelles
qui s'appuic sur les actions suivantes:
- mise en place d'un cadre juridique approprie;
- d velDpyement d'activit6s d'IEC pour renforcer les connaissances sur la muntualtd
- formation des promoreurs et des adh6rents des mumelles ;
- &ablissement ct renforcement d'un partenariat entre les diff6rents acteurs de la mutualite;
- appui fuiancier at technique au riveau du Minisare de la Sante eE de l'Action Sociale pour
Ia promotion de ia mnuwalit6.
11 est A noter qie le PNDS/PIS constimue desormais le soul cadre d'intervendon de nos
partcnaires au d6veloppemacn dans le secteur et qu'il va ete mis en place des proc6dures de
gestion conrcrttes qui feront l'objet d'un manuel utilisd & tous les niveaux pour la gostion du
progranmme.
5. Appui Isisdutonnel
La mnise exi oeuvre des importantes reformes initi6es dans le secteur pour accompagner le PIS
ndecessite un effort particulier dans le domaine du developpement des capacit6s. C'est ainsi
qu'un appui institutionnel va atre apport6 i tous les niveaux qu'il s'agisse des directions
vechniques, des regions medicales ou dcs districts. Les ONG serout mises i contrbution A
tTavers des conventions-types.
L'accent sera mis sur le parLenariar pour Loutes les questions li6es au developpement des
capacit6s.
6. Amelioradon de 1'acc1s aux services de Sante et d'Action Sociale
Compte temn de l'augientation de la population er de l'objectif qui est d'asssurer un
meilIeure 6quitX  dans )'accts aux soins, il inporte d'augmentcr la couverture en
infrastructumes socio-sanitaires par la construction ou la r6babilitation des h6pitaux, centres de
saat6, postes de santc et centres de promotion er de reinsertion sociale du pays, en parLiculior
daxns les zones urbaines et suburbaines.
7. Amilioration de la quaitd des prestations de service
II y a cgalemenr lieu d'amIliorer l'accessibilit6 flnancitre aux services de sant6 par une

S. Developpement des Ressaurces Humnaines
La regionalisation et les reformes engagdes par le Gouvernement yont entrainer des mutations
imporzantes en maciere de gestion et d'administration des ressources humaines.
Pour ce qui est du personnel mis i la disposition des collecdvirds locales par le Minist6re de la
Sanci, leurs.gestion et administration courante feront l'objet d'un guide de procedures.
Quant a la diversicS des statuts des personnels au niveau des itablissemenrs sanitaires, le
Gouvernement va iniEir une &tude pour harmoniser lutilisation eE Ia carriere des divers
perscnneis de samTe concernds. Ceci est valable pour l'ensemble du personnel de la SSanr pour
iviter 'Ls disparites qui pourraient resulter de la diversiT6 des employeurs i tous les niveaux.

pos.es budLrtaires au niveau decencralisE. ne pouvant tre pourvus qu'a l'intdrieur de la meme
collecivit6 locale.
Le  Gouvernement va faire un effort particulier de recrutement en fonction des besoins en
personnels sp6cialistcs, gendralisres tant au niveau des m6decins, pharmacien  et chirurgieis
dentisw.es qu'au niveau des paramedicaux. A cet effet, un systEme d'evaluation des besoins en
person.nels socio-sa.itaires tenant compte des departs pr&visionnels et de I'apport des
coIUeciViLeS locales. sera mils en place. Ce recrutement ser fait sur la base des capacitEs des
institutions do formation i assurer la formation des personnels necessaires au foncaonnement
ctirmal des strucutres sanitaires publiques, privies, eE des collectivites locales.
9. Lutte contre la mialadie et surveillance epideniologique

la periode 1997 - 2006.
L'elaboration du Programme d'Investissement Sectoriel (PIS) 1997 - 2001 et la mise en

maladies cibles du PEV, les ERA, les MST/SIDA et autre endemies locales.
- Reduire la mortalite maternelle par une amelioration de la couverture en
consultation prenatale, et par l'amelioration de la qualit6 de la prise en charge
du processus aux ages extremes et la reduction des accouchements non assistes.
