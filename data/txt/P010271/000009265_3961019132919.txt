NINTH POWER PROJECT
(Credit 1736-CE)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Ninth Power Project in Sri
Lanka for which Cr. 1736-CE in the amount of SDR 43.2 million (US$52.0 million equivalent) was
approved on October 14, 1986. The Credit was closed on June 30, 1994, two years behind schedule.
Final disbursement took place on March 27, 1995, at which time a balance of SDR 9.4 million (US$14.7
million equivalent) was canceled.  Cofinancing was provided by the Overseas Development
Administration of the United Kingdom.
The ICR was prepared by Messrs. Mohinder P. Manrai, Senior Power Engineer, Energy
and Project Finance Division, Country Department I of the South Asia Regional Office and Mr. Nurul
Alam, Senior Program Officer, Bangladesh, Resident Mission. It has been reviewed by Messrs. Per
Ljung, Chief, Energy and Project Finance Division and Mr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, Project Adviser,
Country Department 1. The Borrower provided comments that are included as Appendix B to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR began during IDA's final supervision/completion mission (July
25 to August 6, 1994. It is based on material in the Project file. The Borrower contributed to
preparation of the ICR by its own evaluation of the Project's execution. Although invited to do so, the
cofinancier did not submit a separate evaluation.

SRI LANKA
NINTH POWER PROJECT
(Credit 1736-CE)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
The Bank Group's involvement with Sri Lanka's power sub-sector began in 1954 when
a loan (Ln. 101-CE) was made to the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) for the expansion of a
hydroelectric scheme. Since then the Bank Group, through 10 additional loans/credits, has been actively
involved in providing resources needed for the development of the sub-sector in terms of capacity to meet
demand at least cost and to encourage institutional reforms.
In 1983, GOSL and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) initiated a study with assistance
from IDA and the United Nations Development Programme under the Energy Sector Management
Assistance Program  (ESMAP) to identify measures to reduce system  losses.  Based on the
recommendations of the study, CEB prepared an investment plan for the period 1985-1995 to rehabilitate,
reinforce and expand CEB's distribution system. The Ninth Power Project covered a four-year time slice
of the investment plan (paras. 1 and 2).
Objectives
The principal objectives of the Project were to: improve the reliability and quality of
power supply, reduce losses to economic levels, and expand the distribution system to meet the forecast
demand for electricity. The Project consisted of a four-year time slice of CEB's distribution rehabilitation
and expansion program. The Project comprised the erection of about 950 km of 33-kV lines, extension
and rehabilitation of low voltage distribution networks in Colombo city and elsewhere in Sri Lanka, and
technical assistance to CEB. The objectives were clear, realistic and consistent with IDA's and GOSL's
strategy for the power sub-sector (para. 3.)
Implementation Experience and Results
The Project substantially achieved its institutional objectives and, on its completion, will
substantially achieve its physical objectives as described in the Project scope. However, the power sector
in general is not performing satisfactorily due to a power generation crisis by poor management and
therefore the sectoral objectives were achieved only partially. The financial objective was to ensure
CEB's continued financial viability through attainment of a satisfactory rate of return (ROR). Although
during Project implementation, CEB increased the tariffs, these were inadequate to meet the agreed ROR
(para 8). The achievement of financial objectives is therefore partial. Inspite of IDA's repeated requests,
GOSL/CEB did not show enough commitment to meet the covenants. As a consequence, IDA decided
to close one of the ongoing credits, Cr. 1933-CE (paras. 8 to 12). The distribution system has been
extended and reinforced; there has been improvement in the level of operating voltage; and the level of
technical losses and reliability of power supply have improved. The original Project completion period
of four years was optimistic. Due to implementation problems, the completion was delayed by four years
(para 27). On completion, the Project will be a part of CEB's integrated distribution system and the
major objectives achieved will be sustained.



ii
The Project's estimated cost at appraisal was US$108.1 million, including foreign
exchange cost of US$65.0 million. Foreign cost was to be financed by IDA (US$52.0 million) and
Overseas Development Administration (ODA) of the United Kingdom (US$13.0 million). Local costs
were to be funded by CEB. The Project will be completed by December 31, 1995 compared with the
appraisal target of June 30, 1991. On completion, the Project is now estimated to cost US$103.1 million
with financing of the foreign costs by IDA of US$46.1 million and by ODA of US$15.6 million.
The key factors that affected the achievement of physical objectives were: (a) civil unrest
in the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka which hampered Project implementation and the scope
of the Project had to be modified; (b) sanctions imposed by the United Nations on some of the
constituents of the former Yugoslavia caused IDA and CEB to stop payments to one of the turn-key
contractors and consequently, the contractor had to abandon its contract; (c) due to security conditions
in the country, the scope of the work had to be reduced (para. 14); and (d) changes in the routes of the
sub-transmission lines, revision of scope of works, protracted procurement procedures, inadequate work
force, and priority given by CEB to expansion and rural electrification rather than rehabilitation also
caused delays in the implementation of the Project (paras. 17-19). Also, due to reluctance of GOSL/CEB
to set appropriate levels and structures of tariffs, CEB did not meet the financial objectives since 1988
(para. 9).
IDA and CEB jointly prepared the Project which was a part of CEB's least cost expansion
and rehabilitation program and their performance during the identification and preparation stages were
highly satisfactory (paras. 25, 26 and 29). During appraisal, IDA did not fully assess the security risks
in the Northern and Eastern provinces and the adequacy of CEB's force account to implement the
expansion and the rehabilitation of medium and low voltage lines. Only four years was provided for
Project implementation which was optimistic, and the Closing Date had to be extended. Other factors
and risks were fully assessed and mitigating steps were included in the Project design. Overall, appraisal
of the Project was satisfactory (para. 27). Satisfactory supervision of the Project was also carried out
by IDA on a regular basis. CEB's procurement procedures were protracted causing delays. CEB could
not add any new generating unit for last three years causing load shedding. CEB's financial performance
was poor and it could not meet the financial covenants. Its performance during implementation was
therefore deficient (para 30).
The Project substantially achieved its major objectives. The economic internal rate of
return is estimated at 10%, which is slightly higher than the appraisal estimate of 9%. The overall
assessment of the Project is satisfactory (para. 31).
Proiect Sustainability
On completion the Project will be a part of CEB's integrated distribution system. CEB
has drawn a detailed Operational Plan (Appendix A) indicating how the Project will be sustained.

Summary of Findings. Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
In the type of Project where extensive lines and substations are involved, detailed design
and advance procurement actions should be undertaken during the preparation stage of a Project. The
implementation period should not be too optimistic; it should be realistic and based on country and
regional experience. For supply and erect type of contracts, there should be a quick mechanism for
resolution of disputes (e.g., Dispute Resolution Committee of United Kingdom) and the mechanism
should be incorporated in the bidding documents. The present arbitration procedure is formal and
cumbersome. Presently the Bank is attempting to introduce a "Dispute Resolution Board" for such types
of contracts and this is a step in the right direction. The Bank's long experience with CEB shows that
CEB's financial operations are inefficient and, therefore, the Bank has decided that further assistance in
the short term for the sector should be provided through the private sector instead of the public sector
(para. 34).
A monitorable Operational Plan has been agreed with GOSL/CEB and it will be reviewed
by subsequent IDA missions supervising the remaining ongoing Project with CEB (Second Power
Distribution and Transmission Project Cr. 2297-CE). Any impact evaluation of the Project should be
carried out by the Operations Evaluation Department around end-1996, when the Project would have
completed one year of operation (para. 32).

Background
1.            Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), a statutory organization established in 1969, is the
principal entity in Sri Lanka's power sub-sector and is responsible for generation and transmission
throughout the country and for distribution in areas that are not served by the Lanka Electric Company
Limited (LECO) and local authorities (licensees). During the period 1977-1985, electricity sales in Sri
Lanka had increased at an average annual rate of 7.8%. Although this increase was matched by adequate
expansion of CEB's generation and transmission facilities, investments for sub-transmission and
distribution facilities were inadequate. Consequently, system development was not balanced and led to
high system losses (17% of gross generation in 1985). To improve the quality and reliability of
electricity supply and the operating efficiency of the power system, the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL)
and CEB, with assistance of IDA and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), initiated
a study in 1983 under the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) to identify measures
to reduce system losses. Based on the recommendations of the study, CEB prepared an investment plan
for the period 1985-1995 to rehabilitate, reinforce and expand CEB's distribution system in coordination
with planned expansion of the generation capacity.
2.           The Ninth Power Project (Cr. 1736-CE) covered a four-year time slice of the investment
plan. It was appraised in October 1985 and the Credit was approved by the IDA's Board on October 14,
1986. The Credit and Project Agreements were signed on November 7, 1986 and declared effective on
March 2, 1987. The Project was originally scheduled to be completed by June 30, 1991, which was
optimistic (para. 27). It is now expected to be completed by December 1995. The Credit closed on June
30, 1994, two years behind schedule, and requiring two formal extensions. Cofinancing of US$13
million was expected to be provided by the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) of the United
Kingdom.

A. Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
3.            Project Objectives: The principal objectives of the Project were to: improve the reliability
and quality of power supply; reduce technical losses; extend and reinforce the distribution system;
improve CEB's capability to construct and maintain its distribution system; and enhance its operational
efficiency. The Project also aimed to assist CEB in developing a more appropriate balance between
generation, transmission and distribution facilities in order to meet the forecast demand at least cost.
These objectives were clear, realistic and consistent with the IDA's strategy for Sri Lanka's power sub-
sector. Further, they were consistent with GOSL's energy strategy, which has as one of its principal
objectives the improvement of the quality and reliability of electricity supply and efficiency in the
operation of the power system. The Project was well designed to meet these objectives and was a part
of CEB's investment program; as such it was not complex or demanding for CEB. However, the Project
coverage extended to the Northern and Eastern provinces of the country which were facing civil unrest,
and, therefore, was risky.  Due to an increase in civil unrest, extension of sub-transmission and
distribution lines in the Northern province had to be abandoned and in the Eastern province reduced.
4.            Project Description: In order to achieve the above objectives, the following components
were included under the Project:
(a)    Backbone Lines and Gantries outside Colombo: construction of about 250 km of double
circuit, and 550 km of single circuit 33-kV main distribution lines, and of about 50
33-kV switching stations (gantries);
(b)    Medium Voltage (MV) and Low Voltage (LV) Systems outside Colombo: construction
of about 150 km of single circuit 33-kV lines, about 50 km of single circuit 11-kV lines,
and installation of about 50 MVAR capacity of capacitors; strengthening and upgrading
of about 500 km of 1 l-kV lines; installation of about 1,200 33-kV/LV and about 300
1 1-kV/LV distribution transformer stations and transformers, and the conversion of about
200 km of LV lines to three phase; and line materials, vehicles, tools and instruments for
the rehabilitation of the low-voltage network;
(c)    Distribution System within Colombo: construction of two 33-kV/11-kV and 125 11-
kV/LV substations, the installation of about 15 km of 33-kV, 120 km of 1 I-kV and
125 km of low voltage cables for the underground network in the city of Colombo; and
(d)    Technical Assistance: consulting services for detailed engineering, Project management,
Project accounting, training CEB staff in modern methods for the construction and
maintenance of the distribution systems, and preparation of a distribution master plan.
B. Achievement of Obiectives
5.            Macroeconomic Policies:  Macroeconomic policies were not included in the design of
the Project.  However, sectoral policies for efficient financial operations of CEB and satisfactory
mobilization of resources were covered and are discussed below.
6.            Sectoral Policies: This Project addressed limited sectoral policy issues. At the time of
appraisal of the Project, the distribution in most of the country was being handled and managed by about
200 licensees. It was realized that this arrangement was not satisfactory and needed to be rationalized.



Therefore, as a part of the Project, a distribution master plan was prepared by CEB, with assistance of
consultants, and recommendations emanating from this report have been implemented under subsequent
IDA Credits (Cr. 1933-CE and Cr. 2297-CE).
7.            Because this was primarily a distribution Project, the distribution system has been
extended and reinforced, and there has been improvement in the level of operating voltages, especially
of heavily loaded feeders. The level of technical losses in the Project distribution system and the
reliability and quality of power supply have improved. The number and duration of breakdowns in the
distribution system have also been reduced. However, the overall system losses have deteriorated and,
based on information provided by CEB, these were 16.4% in FY85 and 17.8% in FY93. In reality, the
system losses were slightly higher because CEB regularly adjusts its accounts receivable on the basis of
representations from its consumers, without corresponding adjustments of its energy sales. Regarding
the power generation, the picture is bleak. Due to poor management, there has been no addition to the
generation facilities for the last three years and no new Project is nearing completion. All this will result
in heavy load shedding in the near future. Thus overall the sectoral achievement was partial.
8.            Financial Objectives: The financial objective was to ensure CEB's continued financial
viability through attainment of a satisfactory rate of return (ROR).  Although during Project
implementation (1986-1994), tariffs were increased at an annual average rate of about 15% (from Rs
1.48/kWh to Rs 3.75/kWh during 1986 - 1994), since 1988, these increases have been inadequate to meet
the covenanted rate of return target of 8 %. The major reasons for CEB's non-compliance with the ROR
covenant are as follows: (a) inadequate tariff increases; (b) increasing system losses; (c) GOSL's decision
in May 1994 to roll back tariffs to the pre-February 1994 levels for the first 0-lOOkWh domestic
consumption block (about 17% of the overall sales). With this adjustment, the tariff for the above block
is only Rs 1.62/kWh (US$0.03/kWh) and is about 43% of the average revenue rate; and (d) abolition of
fuel surcharge with effect from February 1994. Lack of commitment on GOSL/CEB's part to comply
with agreed covenants led to the closing of one of the ongoing Credits (Cr. 1933-CE) without further
consideration of an extension which had been approved conditionally. More recently however, CEB's
latest estimates for FY94 indicate that its ROR attained at the end of 1994 was around 8% (this will be
verified after receipt of the FY94 audited accounts). A comparison of CEB's financial statements between
appraisal estimates and actuals is provided in Appendix C.
9.            As of end December 1994, CEB's total receivables were satisfactory and at Rs 2979
million or at a level of 2.6 months of annual electricity sales. However, the receivables from the low
voltage private and government consumers were at a level of 4.5 months and were unsatisfactory.
Overall the financial objectives were only partially achieved (para 16).
10.          Institutional Development Obiectives: CEB's capability to plan, design, construct and
maintain its distribution system improved under this Project which, together with the preparation and
recommendation of the distribution master plan, helped CEB to take over the operations of about 200
licensees under subsequent Projects. The achievement of institutional development objectives was
substantial.
11.           Physical Obiectives: For implementation of the Project as described in para 4, the scope
of work was sub-divided into several packages. The expansion of the backbone lines and gantries outside
the Colombo area was covered under Contract 1 [sub-para 4(a) above], the developments within Colombo
City were covered under Contract 2 ([sub-para 4(c)], while procurement of equipment, vehicles, tools
and materials required for the improvement, development and expansion of the existing 33-kV, 1 1-kV



and LV systems [sub-paras 4(b)] were covered under Contracts 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Contracts 1 and 2 were
awarded on supply-erect basis (the later work being financed by ODA, U.K.), while the materials
procured under Contracts 3 through 7 were erected by CEB with its own staff.
12.           Detailed design for the Project was carried out by CEB with assistance of consultants.
A computer aided design package was used to identify the reinforcement and expansion requirements of
the system. Based on the detailed designs, the quantity of works of the various components were
modified and, due to security considerations (para. 14), the physical objectives of the Project had to be
revised. Because the location, size, voltage, type and switching arrangements of the capacitors could not
be finalized by CEB, the procurement and installation of the capacitors were deleted from the Project
scope. The appraisal estimates, the design estimates and the expected achievement on completion of the
Project are shown in Part 11, Table 5. The design of the Project was appropriate for achieving the Project
objectives and the criteria for monitoring the achievements were quantified in the SAR. Overall, the
Project on its completion will substantially achieve its physical objectives.
13.           Economic Analysis: The Project was a part of CEB's least cost expansion program, and
during appraisal the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) on CEB's investment program for
generation, transmission and distribution for the period 1986-2000 was estimated at 9%. Based on actual
data for the period 1986-1993 and reliable estimates for 1994, the revised EIRR is estimated at 10%,
which is slightly higher than the appraisal estimate. The assumptions used for calculating the EIRR are
shown in Part II, Table 9 and the calculations in Appendix D.
C. Major Factors Affecting the Proiect
14.           Factors not generally subiect to Government control: Contract 1 was awarded to a
contractor from Yugoslavia at the end of September 1988 with a completion target of June 30, 1991.
The contractual completion date was initially extended to June 30, 1992, then to December 31, 1992 and
finally to May 31, 1993. Even with these extensions, the works could not be completed. Two major
factors which were generally outside the control of the Government and the contractor affected the
Project. First, due to security considerations in the Northern and Eastern provinces of the country, the
scope of the contract had to be reduced in these provinces. Second, because sanctions were imposed by
the United Nations against some of the constituents of the previous Republic of Yugoslavia, payments
to the contractor for the development of MV main networks were stopped with effect from May 1992.
As a result, there were delays in the implementation and further the contractor had to abandon some
works; the contract was modified and the remaining works are now being completed by CEB. In addition
to the factors cited above, other factors under the control of the contractor that adversely affected this
contract were: (a) late finalization by the contractor of the profile survey, soil investigation and line
design, and hence deternination of quantities for procurement; and (b) inadequate equipment for erection
works. These factors substantially affected the physical implementation of the Project.
15.           Contract 2 was awarded to a U.K. contractor in March 1988. The original contractual
completion date, February 4, 1991, was extended to October 28, 1991. While, overall, the contract was
executed in a satisfactory manner, there were design and installation problems with a number of joints
for the 33-kV cable between Kelanitissa Power Station and Kotahena sub-station. This resulted in a
dispute between CEB and the contractor, which was resolved in 1994 through the Central Dispute
Resolution Committee of the U.K. Whereas other works were taken over and commissioned, the
Kotahena sub-station remained unutilized for about 30 months pending the resolution of the dispute. If
provision of such a quick dispute resolution mechanism had been incorporated in the bidding documents,



- 5 -
the resolution of the dispute could have been expedited. This factor affected the physical implementation
of the Project partially.
16.           Factors generallv subject to Government control: CEB is not in compliance with two
major covenants, both of which are subject to Government control. Due to inadequate tariffs (para. 8),
CEB has not been meeting its ROR covenant since 1988. CEB has consistently failed to submit its
audited financial statements in a timely manner (audits are carried out by the Governments's Auditor
General's office). These factors substantially affected the financial objectives of the Project.
17.           Factors generally subiect to implementing agencv control: In addition to the factors
mentioned above (para. 14), Contract 1 faced additional problems which were subject to the control of
CEB. The original routes of the lines were designed to follow the existing transmission lines which
would have required cutting of valuable trees, causing possible litigation by the land owners. In order
to avoid this litigation, CEB decided to route the lines through paddy fields and abandoned marshes. This
decision was taken without detailed soil investigation of the new routes. As a result, during erection of
the towers and gantries, the contractor encountered soils for which special foundations were required.
Since these foundations were not included in the original contract, there were disputes between CEB and
the contractor over the rates for these foundations. CEB also selected single bus-bar gantries in
preference to double bus-bar gantries to economize the cost. However, with hindsight, at selected places
where rapid load development was expected, double bus-bar arrangements should have been made.
18.           While Contract 2 faced very few problems during execution, there were problems with
the joints of the 33-kV cables in one section (para. 15). It took CEB and the contractor a long time to
resolve the dispute during which period one sub-station remained unutilized. CEB could have played a
more pro-active role to resolve the dispute in a timely manner.
19.           Under Contracts 3 through 7, CEB procured distribution materials for expansion and
rehabilitation of lines and sub-stations in areas that were not covered under Contracts 1 & 2. Whereas
the appraisal was based on preliminary estimate, the detailed design and bill of quantities were prepared
during appraisal.  The erection of the materials procured was done by CEB's force account.
Implementation of this component was poor due to: (a) protracted procurement procedures of
GOSL/CEB; (b) revision in the scope of the work by CEB; (c) CEB's poor inventory control; (d) the
limited number of CEB's construction force (efforts were made to engage local contractors for the
erection works but only a few were capable of constructing power lines and sub-stations); (e) priority
given by CEB to expansion and construction works under the rural electrification program rather than
to rehabilitation of the existing networks; and (f) resistance from the consumers to the shut-downs needed
to reconstruct and rehabilitate the lines and sub-stations.
20.           The factors mentioned above substantially affected the implementation progress of the
Project.
21.           Project Cost and Financing: The Project's estimated cost at appraisal was US$108.1
million (based on mid-1986 prices), including contingencies, duties and taxes. The foreign exchange cost
of the Project was estimated at US$65.0 million, with financing from IDA (US$52.0 million) and ODA
(US$13.0 million). Local costs were to be financed by CEB from internal resources. On completion,
the total cost of the Project is now estimated to be US$103.1 million, with the foreign exchange cost
being US$61.7 million. The revised Project costs are very close to the appraisal estimates. The original
and final Project costs and financing plan are shown in Part II, Tables 8A and 8B.



- 6 -
22.           Project Implementation: During appraisal it was estimated that the Project would be
completed by June 30, 1991. However, due to the reasons cited above (paras. 14-19), the Project has
been substantially delayed and it is now expected that the Project will be completed by December 31,
1995. The estimated and actual disbursements are shown in Part II, Table 4. The Credit Closing Date,
originally June 30, 1992 was extended twice, by one year each time, to June 30, 1994. Disbursements
of SDR 33.8 million (US$46.1 million equivalent) were made till March 27, 1995 and an outstanding
balance of SDR 9.4 million (US$14.7 million equivalent) was canceled. The main reasons for these
cancellations were: (a) appreciation of SDR against US$ (about US$9.1 million); and (b) outstanding
payments to the Yugoslav contractor on account of United Nations sanctions (US$ 1.8 million - para. 14).
23.           Environment: The Project's direct adverse impact was limited to construction of new
lines and sub-stations. The ecological impact of the distribution lines was regulated by Sri Lanka's
existing laws, including the Electricity Act, the Flora and Fauna Act, and the Forestry Ordinance. These
laws adequately regulate any adverse ecological impact from the Project. On the other hand, the Project
has had a positive impact by providing a higher quality of life by replacing kerosene lamps with
electricity, which is efficient, clean and relatively safe compared to kerosene lamps.
D. Proiect Sustainability
24.           On completion, the Project will be a part of CEB's integrated distribution system. Two
follow-up Projects' have been approved by IDA to strengthen transmission and distribution system of
CEB even further. In addition, other donors are also providing assistance to CEB. Under all these
Projects, substantial funds for training in all spheres of CEB's operations have been provided. Because
of continuing expansion of the transmission and distribution network and training of CEB's staff, the
major overall objectives achieved under the Project will be sustained. Further, CEB has prepared a
detailed Operational Plan to ensure future maintenance and sustainability of the Project (Appendix A).
In order to ensure CEB's continued financial viability, GOSL has decided to carry out a comprehensive
tariff study to review the adequacy of tariff levels and structures. The recommendations of the study are
expected by about December 1995.
E. IDA's Performance
25.           Project Identification: This Project was identified as a result of the ESMAP study (para.
1) initiated in 1983 to reduce system losses and to expand and rehabilitate the sub-transmission and
distribution system. It is consistent with the Bank's and GOSL's strategy for the power sub-sector.
IDA's role in this regard was highly satisfactory.
26.           Project Preparation: IDA assisted CEB in the preparation of the Project and identified
distinct components keeping in view the importance of load centers. One component was exclusively
designed for the Colombo distribution system which serves important industrial and commercial loads
mainly through underground cables. The second was designed for medium voltage sub-transmission lines
outside the Colombo area, while the third component covered the expansion and rehabilitation of the
remaining distribution system. Other technical, financial, economic, institutional and environmental
aspects were reviewed carefully and included in the Project scope wherever necessary. The performance
of IDA in the preparation was satisfactory.

27.           Project Appraisal: Appraisal of the Project was carried out in October 1985 by an
economist, a financial analyst and three power engineers. The time spent on appraisal was appropriate
and adequate. In addition to the aspects mentioned above (para. 26), IDA also reviewed the cornmitment
of GOSL and CEB towards the Project's objectives during appraisal. The Project was a part of CEB's
least cost development program and both GOSL and CEB were fully committed to it. The capacity and
capability of CEB for implementing the Project was also reviewed and found to be adequate because in
1984 CEB had started to decentralize its management structure in order to be more responsive to its ever
increasing work load. This restructuring was done on the basis of the recommendations of management
consultants engaged under IDA's Sixth Power Project (Cr. 1048-CE). However, the appraisal mission
also concluded that CEB would require technical assistance for preparing detailed design and for training
of CEB staff in certain critical areas which were considered necessary to sustain the Project. Necessary
provisions were made in the Project for financing the technical assistance and training. The lending
instrument, financial package and the cofinancing arrangements (with ODA) were also appropriate. Based
on experience in Sri Lanka and in the region, the implementation schedule of four years for the Project
was optimistic, especially since advance procurement actions were not taken. Except for the security
situation in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, and for the performance of the supply and erect
contractors and the adequacy of CEB's force account, all other risks were identified during appraisal.
Overall, the appraisal of the Project by IDA was satisfactory.
28.           Project Supervision: The Project was regularly supervised by IDA staff with 1  missions
fielded during the life of the Project. The skill mix and duration of the missions were appropriate and
adequate and recommendations of the missions were reflected in the country implementation reviews.
The Bank's resident mission in Sri Lanka also played a role during the missions. The supervision
missions identified the implementation problems and also recommended appropriate remedial measures.
To enforce the compliance with financial covenants (para. 8), remedies were sought by IDA through
threatening of closure of the Credit after one extension. As a result, two tariff increases of 30% each
were effected (para 8). IDA supervision missions assisted CEB in resolving a number of problems. For
example, IDA helped CEB to resolve its dispute with the contractor for Contract 2 through its dialogue
with ODA (Bangkok). IDA missions also assisted in the execution of the Contract by meeting with CEB
management, consultants and contractors and suggesting constructive steps (finalizing the disputed
foundation costs, procuring balance materials for the Contract directly by CEB instead of through the
turnkey contractor, etc.). IDA showed flexibility in the execution of the Project by agreeing to
modifications in the details of the Project components based on detailed designs. No significant
deviations were made in the Bank's policies and procedures. Overall, the supervision was carried out
in a satisfactory manner.
F. Performance of the Borrower and Beneficiary
29.           Proiect Identification, Preparation, and Appraisal: During the Project identification stage,
CEB recognized the importance of planning and design of a power distribution system. It had established
a "Loss Reduction Cell" which in August 1984 was later converted to a full-fledged "Distribution
Development and Rehabilitation Branch." It also acquired a distribution study software package and
prepared a Project Document in April 1985. This document formed the basis for IDA to prepare and
appraise the Project to which CEB was fully committed. CEB's performance during the identification
and preparation was highly satisfactory, and during appraisal satisfactory.



- 8 -
30.           Project Implementation: During implementation, counterpart funds were provided by
CEB in a timely manner. The training component was also properly utilized. CEB appointed competent
staff to supervise and monitor the Project. However, there were frequent changes of key Project staff.
Progress reports were prepared in a timely manner and were adequate for IDA to monitor the
performance of the Project. CEB fully cooperated with IDA supervision missions. The sectoral policy
issues (except in the generation area) were addressed by GOSL/CEB (paras. 6-7).  Institutional
development objectives were met substantially, the physical objectives will be met substantially on
completion (paras. 10, 11 and 12). There were protracted delays in the evaluation of bids and award of
contracts. These issues were raised by IDA supervision missions and GOSL/CEB were responsive
partially and modified the thresholds for procurement approval. CEB's overall performance in the
implementation of the Project was deficient. Due to mismanagement, there is a looming power
generation crisis (para 7). CEB is not in compliance with three major financial covenants (para 16).
G. Assessment of Outcome
31.           The Project substantially achieved its sectoral and institutional objectives. The physical
objectives will also be substantially be achieved on completion, but the financial objectives could not be
achieved. The Project is sustainable (para. 24). Both the Project cost and its foreign portion are close
to the SAR estimated values. The EIRR is slightly higher than the appraisal estimate (para. 13). Overall
assessment of the Project is satisfactory.
H. Future Operation
32.           Although during appraisal an operational plan was not agreed with GOSL/CEB, such a
monitorable plan was agreed during the final supervision/implementation completion mission. The plan
provides for technical inputs from CEB at agreed intervals. It also addresses issues required for
satisfactory future financial operation of the Project. Implementation of the plan will be monitored by
IDA as a part of its supervision of the ongoing Project (Cr. 2297-CE). An impact evaluation of the
Project should be carried out by the Operations Evaluation Department around end-1996, when one year
of operation after full completion of the Project will have been completed.
1. Key Lessons Learned
33.           Implementation of the Project suffered due to: (a) revisions in Project scope and design;
(b) changes in the routes of the sub-transmission lines; (c) poor inventory control of materials; (d)
protracted procurement procedures; (e) opposition from consumers against frequent shut-downs; (f) civil
unrest initially in the whole country and later in the Northern and Eastern provinces; (g) protests from
the landowners for constructing the lines across their land; and (h) delay by the contractors. The
following are the key lessons learned:
(i)    detailed designs for the main components should be carried out during the preparation
stage of the Project. If there are large networks, detailed design of typical sample
sections should be prepared and extrapolated for the design of the complete system. This
can be done either through an existing operation, through Trust Funds, or through stand-
alone technical assistance;
(ii)    advance procurement actions should be initiated prior to negotiations for any future
investment operation;



-9 -
(iii)   for supply and erect type of contracts, there should be a quick mechanism for the
resolution of disputes (e.g., the Dispute Resolution Committee of UK) and the
mechanism should be incorporated in the bidding documents;
(iv)   survey of medium  voltage line (33kV) routes should be completed during Project
preparation and land should be acquired and/or right of way obtained before Credit
approval;
(v)    intensive training should be given to Project staff on material management and inventory
control;
(vi)   live line construction and maintenance methods should be introduced;
(vii)  security risks should be properly evaluated and works in security prone areas should not
be included in the scope of a future project;
(viii)  efforts should be made by CEB to develop local contractors for the erection of power
lines and sub-stations,
(ix)   procurement procedures should be streamlined; and
(x)    land acquisition and compensation procedures should be simplified.
34.           Although, Bank/IDA have supported GOSL/CEB through 11 power sector operations (of
which ten have been closed), CEB system losses and accounts receivable continues to be high. While
during the earlier operations tariffs were adjusted periodically, (1988, 1990, 1993 and 1994), there is
now reluctance on the part of GOSL/CEB to set the level and structure of tariffs appropriately. In view
of the poor financial performance and a looming power crisis, in large measure due to poor power sector
management performance, GOSL is now rethinking its power sector development strategy, and is seeking
private sector investments for establishing new generation plants. IDA's strategy for the sector for further
assistance in the short term will be targetted to the private sector.

Implementation Completion Report Mission
July 25 - August 6, 1994
Aide Memoire4
Introduction
1.           An IDA mission comprising of Messrs. M. P. Manrai, Senior Power Engineer and Nurul
Alam, Senior Program Officer, visited Sri Lanka from July 25 to August 6, 1994 to supervise and initiate
the preparation of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Power IX - Distribution
Expansion and Distribution Project (Credit 1736-CE).
2.            The mission would like to thank the officials of the Ministry of Power and Energy, the
Ministry of Finance and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for all the courtesies and assistance extended
to the mission. The aide memoire summarizes the mission's findings regarding the status of the Project
and the agreements reached with the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and CEB regarding further
activities required to complete the Project and prepare the ICR.
Background
3.            A Credit of SDR 43.2 million (US$ 52.0 million equivalent) was approved by IDA Board
on October 14, 1986 for financing the implementation of the Project and was declared effective on March
2, 1987. Due to appreciation of SDR against US$, the Credit amount is now equivalent to US$ 59.7
million equivalent. The Closing Date of the Credit, originally June 30, 1992, had been extended twice
and finally closed on June 30, 1994. However, a grace period of four months, i.e., up to October 31,
1994, has been provided for submission of withdrawal applications against eligible expenditures incurred
before the Closing Date. The Overseas Development Administration (ODA) of UK cofinanced the
Project and provided a grant of  8.77 million (equivalent to US$ 13.0 million).
Proiect Components
4.            The Project consist of the following components:
(a)    construction of about 250 km of double circuit and about 550 km of single circuit 33-kV
main distribution lines (Part Al of Schedule 2 to the DCA);
(b)    construction of about 150 km of single circuit 33-kV lines, about 50 km of single circuit
I 1-kV lines, and about 50 33-kV switching stations (gantries); installation of about 50
MVAR of capacitors; and strengthening and upgrading of about 500 km of 1 1-kV lines
(Part A2 of Schedule 2 to the DCA);
(c)    installation of about 1,200 33-kV/LV and about 300 11-kV/LV distribution transformer
stations and transformers, and the conversion of about 200 km of LV lines to three phase
(Part A3 of Schedule 2 to the DCA);
4      Modified version.



-23-
(d)    construction of two 3 3-kV/ 11 -kV and 125 11 -kV/LV substations, the installation of about
15 km of 33-kV, 120 km of 11-kV and 125 km  of low voltage cables for the
underground network in the city of Colombo (Part A4 of Schedule 2 to the DCA);
(e)    line materials, vehicles, tools and instruments for the rehabilitation of low-voltage
network (Part A5 of Schedule 2 to the DCA); and
(t)    consulting services for detailed engineering, Project management, Project accounting,
training of CEB staff in modern methods for the construction and maintenance of the
distribution systems, and preparation of a distribution master plan (Part B of Schedule
2 to the DCA).
Proiect Status
5.            Consultancy: Consultants from the United Kingdom, with financing from IDA, were
selected by CEB to assist them in detailed engineering and management of the Project, especially the
works related to the Development of MV Main Network and the Augmentation of Colombo City Network
components. Based on an agreed design criteria, the consultants and CEB prepared detailed bill of
materials for the development of MV networks as well as rationalization of LV networks. Annex 1 shows
a comparison of the SAR and the design estimates, as well as the present status of the different
components. These are further discussed below in paras. 8 to 11 below. The consultants left the site on
August 30, 1993. They had to stay beyond the original contract date because both the components had
technical and contractual problems. The final value of the contract is  2.19 million and Rs 1.09 million.
6.           In addition to the above, consultancy services from the United Kingdom were financed
under the Credit for: (a) preparing a distribution master plan at a cost of about DM 0.61 million and Rs.
0.38 million; and (b) training of CEB staff in modern methods of construction and maintenance of
distribution systems at a cost of  0.82 million and Rs 4.35 million. Both consultants have completed
their assignments.
7.            Further, CEB has procured software for design and optimization of distribution networks
from a firm from the USA at a cost of US$ 0.17 million and Rs 1.43 million, including the cost of
training in USA of three CEB engineers in operating the software.
8.            Development of MV Main Network (refer Ainex 1)5: A turn key contract for the
supply, delivery and erection of 43 33-kV main lines (545 km) and 38 switching gantries for the main
33-kV system was awarded to a Yugoslav construction company at US$13.04 million plus Rs 139.95
million in October 1988. With 13 variation orders issued (on account of changes in design, different
types of foundations, etc.), the estimated value of the contract is now US$15.69 million and SLRs 445.65
million. The scope of the contract was revised to 37 33-kV lines of about 400 km and 33 gantries. After
three extensions, the contract finally expired on May 31. 1993 and at that time the contractor could only
complete 364 km in length and 31 gantries. The contractor has been paid US$ 13.90 million and
Rs 407.75 million. The outstanding payments due to the contractor, including the variation orders and
claims. amounts to about US$1.79 million and Rs 37.90 million. However, due to sanctions imposed
by the ULnited Nations, these payments cannot be made by CEB.
9.            Materials for all unfinished works have been received at site and taken over by CEB from
thie contractor. During IDA's October 1993 mission, CEB committed to complete the remaining works

(181 km of lines) through its force account by end June, 1994. However, progress has been slow and,
as of June 30, 1994, 124 km in length have been completed and CEB plans to complete the remaining
57 km by end-December 1994.
10.          Out of 38 switching gantries, 31 were constructed by the contractor, 5 have been deleted,
one has been completed by CEB, and the remaining one is being erected by CEB and is planned for
completion by December 31, 1994.
11.          Development of other MV Networks and Rationalization of LV Systems (refer Annex 1):
In addition to the 33-kV main lines mentioned above, CEB planned to upgrade and strengthen its
remaining 33-kV and 11-kV systems by constructing new lines, reconductoring and stepping up the
operating voltage of existing lines. CEB also prepared plans to rationalize its LV networks. Necessary
distribution materials, except for capacitors which was dropped, valued at US$ 27.28 million were
procured under the Credit. As of June 30, 1994, about 63% erection works have been completed and
CEB agreed to complete the remaining works by June 30, 1995. It is understood that CEB could not
complete this work as planned earlier because: (i) it is difficult to have interruptions now, required for
line rehabilitation, and (ii) it has diverted most of its resources to rural electrification, which is being
given high priority by GOSL.
12.          Augmentation of Colombo City Network: A turn key contract, comprising supply,
delivery and erection of 156 km of 33-kV, 11-kV and 0.4-kV underground cables, 138 radial compact
and two primary substations with associated works for Colombo system rehabilitation (financed by ODA,
UK), was awarded to a United Kingdom firm at  6.95 million plus Rs 149.98 million in March 1988.
With 11 variation orders issued, the contract sum increased to  7.37 million plus Rs 178.59 million.
Although the works were completed in July 1992, one primary substation and the 33 kV cables were not
taken over by CEB because of unsatisfactory cable jointing. The dispute was referred to the Centre for
Dispute Resolution (CEDR), through ODA, UK and was settled through mediation process held in Sri
Lanka. In accord with the settlement terms, CEB has agreed to pay  0.37 million and Rs 60.58 million
to the contractor and the contractor has agreed to supply 750 meters of 33-kV cables, six straight through
joints, two outdoor end terminations and two indoor end terminations, provide training to CEB cable
jointers and pay CEB Rs 12.0 million as contribution for ensuring system reliability. The final value of
the contract is now  7.63 million and Rs 203.28 million, which have been paid to the contractor.
Disbursement"
13.          As of July 11, 1994, SDR 30.5 million (equivalent to US$41.3 million) has been
disbursed, with the undisbursed Credit amount being SDR 12.7 million (equivalent to US$ 18.5 million).
This amount includes US$1.06 million disbursed but not recovered under the Special Account. As stated
in para. 3, a grace period of four months, i.e., up to October 31, 1994, has been provided for the
submission of withdrawal applications against eligible expenditures incurred before June 30, 1994.
Within this grace period, CEB should refund to IDA Account "B", with the Federal Reserve Bank, the
unutilized balance of the Special Account. After disbursement against the final withdrawal application,
the undisbursed amount will be canceled. Based on progress achieved, it is estimated that about SDR 8.6
million (equivalent to US$12.1) will be canceled.

CEB Operational Performance
14.           The key operational indicators of CEB from January 1992 to March 1994 are shown in
Annex 2. In 1993, system losses were 17.8% and collections were 93.7%, compared to 17.6% and
89.9% respectively for 1992. The accounts receivable at the end of March 1994 was equivalent to 2.5
months of average billings. However, in 1992 and 1993, CEB made adjustments of Rs 329.9 and
Rs 230.9 million for which satisfactory explanations could not be provided by CEB. Further, in some
months losses are about double than in other months. For example, April 1992 and 1993 losses are 9.2%
and 11.5% compared to 23.0% and 25.4% in March 1992 and 1993 respectively. The mission requested
CEB to forward to IDA, by August 31, 1994, a detailed report on the adjustments carried out in 1992
and 1993, together with an explanation of the wide variations of losses in certain months. The accounts
receivable for local authorities and Government departments and agencies, as of March 31, 1994, stood
at 7.0 months of billings (compared to GOSL's covenanted level of three months). This includes Rs 151
million from the Northern Provinces and has been outstanding for the last four years. The mission was
informed that about Rs 81.9 million will be provided by GOSL in 1995 on account of dues from local
authorities. While this will improve the performance, payments by Government departments and agencies
of their overdues also need to be made. Information provided by CEB shows that the main defaulters
are under the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Health. The mission requested GOSL to ensure early
payments of the overdues. This will enable GOSL to meet the covenant.
Status of Covenants
15.           The status of covenants is shown in Annex 27. As discussed in para. 15 above, GOSL
is not in compliance with the accounts receivable covenant for local authorities and Govermnent
departments. CEB is also not incompliance with the rate of return covenant. As per CEB's calculations,
the ROR for 1993 was 4.6% and for 1994 is Projected to be 6.7% compared to covenanted 7% (under
Cr. 2297-CE) and 8% respectively. While an average tariff increase of about 30% (excluding 0-100 kWh
domestic consumption blocks, for which the increase was lower) was introduced on July 1, 1993 and
another tariff increase of about 30% for all categories, with simultaneous withdrawal of provision of fuel
adjustment charge of 20%, was introduced on February 1, 1994, these increases were not sufficient for
CEB to meet the ROR covenant. This has been compounded by a decision made by GOSL in May 1994
to bring back the tariffs for domestic consumption blocks of 0-100 kWh to the pre-February 1994 level.
16.           CEB continues to be in default in their requirement to submit audit reports within 10
months of the close of the fiscal year. The 1992 audit report, which was due for submission by October
31, 1993, has not yet been submitted. CEB agreed to submit the overdue audit report by August 31.
1994.
Operational Plan
17.           The mission discussed and agreed with CEB an Operational Plan (Annex 3)8
for the operational phase of the Project. Since the works commissioned under the Project are being
integrated within the works of CEB's overall system, its operation will be subject to normal operation
and maintenance work of CEB, an outline of Which is attached to the Operational Plan. Further, since
the Project has not yet been completed, the plan covers its completion and the indicators for monitoring

its operations and development impact. Subsequent IDA power sector missions will monitor those
indicators.
Implementation Completion Report
18.           After completion of each Project an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) is required
to be prepared. The objective of the ICR is to assess primarily (a) the degree of achievement of Project
objectives; (b) prospects for Project sustainability; (c) the performance of IDA and the Borrower; (d)
Project outcome; and (e) the plan for the Project's future operations.  The mission collected
data/information from CEB for the preparation of its section of the ICR. The mission also discussed with
CEB the format for the preparation of their own independent evaluation of the Project. It was agreed that
CEB will forward to IDA. through the department of External Resources, by August 31. 1994 their own
evaluation of the Proiect.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
SRI LANKA
NINTH POWER PROIECT
(Credit 1 736-CE)
BORROWER'S EVALUATION'
(a)   INTRODUCTION
With the development of the economy in the country towards the end of the 1970's a
rapid load growth was observed for electnrcity power. The reinforcement of the
generation and transmission systemns needed to meet the demand were available or was
arranged under several projects. However, the facilities under the distribution
systems were insufficient and the development of the Distribution Sector was urgently
.needed.
Government of Sri Lanka and Ceylon Electricity Board requested from the World
Bank/UNDP assistance to formulate a program to improve the performance of the
power distribution sector, particularly to reduce the high distribution losses prevailing
at that period. Based on the outcome of the study done with the World Bank/UNDP
Study Group a program was planned to improve the Distribution System of the CEB
to meet the demand efficiently.
(b)    PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The principle objectives of the project were to: reduce the technical losses of the
medium voltage (33-kV and 1 1-kV) and low voltage (LV) systems. improve the
qualitv and reliability of power supply, expand the distribution system. establish
proper planning units equipped with modem state of the art technology in distribution
planning, provide assistance in developing CEB's specifications & designs for the
distribution system. assist CEB in obtaining modem techniques and appropriate
training for carrying out a comprehensive rehabilitation program to upgrade the LV
and MV systems.
For easy implementation of the project the scope of work were sub-divided into
several packages.
(i)    Contract I - Backbone Lines and Gantries
Construction of about 545 km of 33-kVthicker gauge conductor (LYNX & ELM)
lines and erection of 50 Nos. of 33-kV switching gantries were planned under this
Contract. The principal objective of constructing those 33-kV backbone lines was to

reduce MV system losses, improve reliability of supply and allow future expansions in
those areas through which these lines were routed.
This scope was finally reduced to 527 route km (consisting of 172 km of Double
Circuit and 355 km of Single Circuit) and 38 Nos. Switching Gantries. This was due
to the deletion of the planned work in the troubled areas of the Northern and the
Eastern Provinces.
Introduction of 33-kV switching gantries equipped with auto reclosers, fuses and load
break switches was planned to improve the reliability of the 33-kV feeders by
separating long distributor spur lines. In most of the cases these 33-kV switching
gantries were to be inter-connected with the next closest Grid Substation through a
switching gantry and one or two other backbone lines. This arrangement affords a
very high reliable supply to the consumers fed off these gantries and meets any
exigency conditions by extending the backbone feeders from one Grid to the other
Grid Substation.
Major portions of the backbone lines in the Western Province of the country (most of
the large loads are located in this Province) were designed with double circuit Lynx
Conductor lines and thus the currem carrying capacity of those double circuits was
approximately 22 MVA. This facility will allow the accommodation of major spot
loads anywhere close to these lines. Introduction of auto recloser facility at the
switching gantries will isolate all the faults on the 33-kV distributor lines which are
normally going through cross country. Further, introduction of a switching gantry
enables the operation units of the area to operate the system in an optimum manner.
Centralizing all switching devices in one particular location (switching gantry) will
minimize outage periods.
(ii)    Contract 2 - Development in the Colombo City
The main objective of this project was to strengthen and rationalize the Distribution
Network in the Colombo City to cater to the increase in the load demand due to the
developments that were taking place in the city. Under this Project arrangements
were made to provide more I l-kV injection points to the city's underground system
making it possible to add a large number of Distribution Transformers and expand the
LV underground cable svstem with additional feeder pillars.
(iii)   Contracts 3, 4, 5 & 7
Improvement, development and expansion of the existing LV. 1 l-kV and 33-kV
systems are envisaged under these packages.
By providing interconnection facilities from one feeder to another feeder and from one
Grid Substation to other Grid Substations it is planned to improve the overall system
reliability. Under this arrangement re-conductoring of some of the line sections was
planned. so that the total power of a main feeder could be distributed through the-



-32-
ARRendix B
Page 3 of 12
inter-connected system. By having such a system, it was envisaged to allow minimnum
interruption to the consumers during maintenance and exigency conditions.
Medium Voltage Expansion Lines were also provided under this category to attract
more small scale industrial consumers into the system. Expansion to some rural areas
has also been planned to improve the social benefits of the project.
Approximnately about 323 km of l1-kV lines were converted to 33-kV operation under
this package. Upgrading of the voltage will reduce the system losses drastically and
allow more future loads to be taken into the system through the same network.
Requirement of investing for future 33/11 primary substations will not arise after
completing this work in these areas where the conversions were planned.
Erection of a large No. of 33/LV & 11/LV Substations and the conversion of Single
Phase LV feeders to Three Phase feeders were proposed under these packages. It is
planned to erect about 1000 Nos. distribution transformers, construct approxirnately
213 km new LV lines and effect the phase conversion of about 2067 km of LV lines.
Reducing losses at the LV level was given high priority under this work content.
Reducing the LV feeder lengths which were as long as 3 kmn, to about 1 kan, by
installing distribution substations at intermnediate points will improve the reliability of
the LV feeders, improve the feeder end voltages and reduce the LV losses.
Reasonable amount of LV conversion and new LV lines have been introduced to
rearrange the whole LV network.
(iv)   Rehabilitation of LV & 1IV4 Network
Frequent failures were experienced in sections of the CEB's Distribution System
which required interruptions to the sections giving rise to loss of revenue and low
reliabilitv. It was necessary to rehabilitate these sections and then to continue the
rehabilitation of the system on a planned and regular basis. This program of
rehabilitation was included under the project and British Consultants were engaged to
formulate this program of rehabilitation and train the necessary staff.
The network components were planned to be rehabilitated by replacement of aged
plant components such as Poles, Hardware, Insulators, Conductors, Earths etc.
continuing the rehabilitation work on a periodic basis every five years for trouble free
operation of the system.
(c)    DESIGN
After establishing a distribution network data base, CEB has carried out Planning of
all the 33-kV reinforcements required to up-grade the 33-kV and 1 1-kV network
under the Project. A Computer aided design package has been used for the evaluation
of technical requirements to meet the expected loads, for a period of 15 years.
Optimum cross sections of the conductors to be used for the construction of the
proposed lines were selected after carrying out Techno-Economic Analysis of the -



-33-
Appendix B
Page 4 of 12
proposals. Based on the loss optimization and the standardization of the conductors
used in the system, it was decided to construcL33-kV backbone lines under this
Project with Lynx conductor or alloy conductor equivalent to Lynx, with single circuit
or double circuit configuration. CEB also had carried out line route planning for all
these 33-kV lines. Location of Switching Gantries and the equipment required for
those gantries were identified during the planning stage. Consultants appointed by the
CEB studied these proposals & justifications and agreed to the same for
implementation.
A large number of MV lines has been proposed under the same Project in order to
reinforce the existing system by effecting inter-connections between the MV networks
among various Grid Substations. Justifications of these lines were based on the
economic benefits by improving the reliability of the system, thus reducing the
amount of unserved energy.
Due to the accelerated expansion program CEB had undertaken during the past
decade, some 33-kV feeders extended to cater to new consumers had to be reinforced.
Small gauge conductors, used in some of the major feeders from Grid Substations had
to be re-conductored with higher gauge conductors in order to reduce system losses.
After analyzing the I 1-kV network in the system it was found that a large portion of
I l-kV network could be converted to 33-kV operation with very high benefit to cost
ratios.
The Low Voltage Systems consisted of three phase transformers and relatively long
LV distributors with unsatisfactory load balance. It was planned to add a large
number of distribution transformers to the system. The construction of New LV lines
and LV Phase Conversions reduced the svstem losses and improved the reliability.
Colombo City Distribution System
After establishing a computer aided distribution database for the Colombo City
distribution system, an analysis on loss optimization was carried out to upgrade the
11-kV and LV system of the City. Load forecast data was obtained from various
institutions involved in the City development process. The complete study package
was carried out by the CEB Engineers. A large number of new distribution
substations, new I l-kV Cables, 2 primary substations, LV underground cables and
new feeder pillars were identified under the package. The 33-kV supply to the
proposed primary substations was worked out based on the optimum location of
proposed primary substations and the availability of close-by sources.
Finalizing of the mechanical and civil designs for the Primary Substations. package
type distribution substations and other equipment was entrusted to consultants.

(d)    MPLEMENTATION
(i)    Contract 1
The contract was awarded to  a contractor from Yugoslavia
at the end of September 1988 with a guaranteed completion before 30th
June 1991. An extension of the contractual completion date to 30th June 1992 was
initially granted and later further extended to 31st December 1992 and subsequently
further extended to 31st May 1993.
The contract awarded consisted of approximately 545 route kmn in 45 different lines
and 38 Nos. switching gantries.
This scope was subsequently reduced to about 400 km in 37 different lines and 33
switching gantries.
A part of this reduced scope was deleted from the contract due to contractors inability
to execute the work in troubled areas and the balance was taken over by the CEB for
completion.
By 31-12-1994 the sum total of lines completed will be 526 route km made up of
172 km of D/C and 354 km of S/C. The number of Gantries completed will be 33
Nos.
The lines handled by the main contractor         which were completed by
31st May 1993 are now energized. Those taken over by the CEB are in various
stages of completion.
The main factors affecting progress include amongst other things the following:
-     Civil unrest in Sri Lanka during 1988 and 1989;
-     Civil war in former Yugoslavia and resultant UN Sanctions imposed on
Serbia;
-     Late finalization by Contractor of profile survey, soil investigation and line
design, and hence determination of quantities for procurement;
-     slow land acquisition process;
-     unforeseen foundation problems, in particular piling due to post-award
decision to route lines as far as possible in paddv areas; extensive foundation
errors (off-axis and inter-stub) by Contractor. necessitating considerable extra
and repeat work;
-     cash flow problems, exacerbated by frozen local bank accounts due to UN
Sanctions;
-     Communication problems due to paucity of English language speakers among
Contractor's site staff;
-     lack of conductor stringing equipment;

premature departure of Contractor's deputy project director (for personal
reasons) at a critical time and without replacement;
poor stock control and physical care procedures at central stores;
incorrect auto recloser orientation, resulting in abortive civil works at a
number of switching gantry sites.

to dangerously high winds and flooding;
delays in stringing due to rice harvesting January and February 1993;

(ii)    Contract 2
The contract was awarded to         a contractor from the          U.K. at
the beginning of March 1988 with a guaranteed completion date of 4th February
1991. An extension of the comractual completion date to 28th October 1991 was
granted to the Contractor.
As at December 1991 of total of 135 km of 33 km, I 1-kV, LV cable installation was
completed. About 20 km of cables were handed over to the CEB. In addition 115
compact substations were commissioned, 32 feeder pillars were installed and
commissioned while the balance 28 were handed over to the CEB.
The 13 radial substations were commissioned and 6 existing radial substations were
modified.
Primary substations at Kirulapone and Kotahena were also completed.
There were design and installation problems with joints for the 33-kV cable between
Kelanitissa Power Station (KPS) and "Sub H" at Kotahena.
Subsequent to the settlement of a dispute between the contractor and CEB brought about by
the Central Dispute Resolution Committee of U.K., the problems on the 33-kV cables
at "Sub H" have been resolved.
(iii)   Contracts 3. 4, 5 & 7
All construction works under the above Contracts were entrusted to the CEB's own
Provincial Construction Units. Delays have been experienced in completing the works
by the targeted dates and now the remaining works have been scheduled to be
completed by June 1995.

(iv)   Rehabilitation of LV & MV Network
The rehabilitation work as explained under I (b)(iv) above was arranged to be
undertaken by the CEB. For this purpose rehabilitation units were established in all
the Provincial Offices of the CEB and this work is being carried out on a periodic
basis.
(e)    OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCE
Some of these 33-kV lines constructed have already been energized and the
performance of the 33-kV network in those areas has been considerably improved. It
is however noted that some of the backbone lines are constructed taking into
consideration the scheduled commissioning of new Grid Substations to which these
new lines are to be connected. Due to the delay in commissioning of these new grid
substations it is not possible to put these lines into useful operation. Similarly,
without additional 33-kV bays at the existing Grid Substations some of the new lines
are paralleled with existing feeders until the new additional bays are constructed under
the ongoing projects. It is therefore felt that the total benefit of this Project can only
be achieved after completion of the ongoing transmission projects.
After energizing some of the new 33-kV lines and switching gantries, particularly in
heavily loaded areas in Western Province, it is noted that the performance of the auto
reclosers installed at switching gantries is not satisfactory. The equipment design
requires 12V/24V/battery supply for the operation and it has now become a problem
in providing this DC supply. Arrangements are now being made to provide LV
supply to these gantries to obtain DC supply through rectifiers. This situation will
restrict the use of these auto reclosers in very remote areas where there is no LV
supply available. CEB has been using Auto-reclosers not requiring DC supply and
this type is found to be satisfactory.
Operation difficulties have also been encountered when the double circuit backbone
lines are connected to single bus bar type of gantries. Flexibility of operation has been
reduced drastically with this shortcoming. The possibility of converting this single
bus bar gantry into a double bus bar gantry is being presently investigated.
At present the capacity of most of the 33-kV bays at the Grid Substations is limited to
200 Amp. due to the available rating of current transformers. This arrangement
restricts the loading of the backbone lines beyond 200 Amp. Under normal
operational conditions this capacity is sufficient to feed the loads. However, under
exigency conditions it is required to transfer the loads from one feeder to another
feeder and from one grid to the other grid substation. Under these circumstances it
may be necessary to use the full capacity of the backbone lines. Therefore it is
recommended to upgrade all the current transformers of these backbone lines to 400
Amps.



-37-
Ay2endix B
Page 8 of 12
Arrangements are already made to procure the necessary equipment for this upgrading
and it is expected to have more operational flexibility after installing them.
It should be pointed out that the addition of new plants & equipment to the system has
relieved the burden on the area operational staff and without much training the
operations can be carried out.
2.  EVALUATION OF THE BORROWERS'S OWN PERFORMANCE
(i)    Contract 1
The Contractor, though experienced in transmission line construction, had never
worked in S.W. Asia. Thus conditions to him were totally alien. Especially the strict
supervision carried out by the consultants/CEB Engineers. They were sort of averse
to criticism and corrective measures.
Changing of Routes
The original routes of the lines were to follow existing transmission lines thus
necessitating cutting of valuable trees like coconut, rubber, jak and other trees. Since
route approval was a tedious task sometimes leading to litigation it was thought
expedient to route the lines through paddy fields and abandoned marshes.
This proved a costly error and a bad decision. The type of soil encountered was so
bad and treacherous that final completion of many lines was totally tied up to the
tower foundations itself.
The foundations in that type of soil were not specified in the contract or the
specifications. These were termed special foundations and consisted of two types (a)
deep rafts and (b) piled foundations.
Since the rates for these types of foundations were not in the schedule of rates, it was
a tedious and time consuming exercise to fix rates and prices for such foundations.
Obviously this was to the advantage of the contractor. Finally such foundations
increased the local component from the initial Rs 140 M to a final figure of Rs 421 M
an increase of about 200%.
This unforeseen expenditure could not be prevented as this category of foundations
accounted for at least 20% of the total tower foundations.
Selection of Gantries
Further, a selection of single bus-bar gantries in preference to double bus-bar gantries
to save on land space and cost was not a good decision. This is very salient where
double circuit back-bone feeders terminate at single bus-bar gantries and again where



-38-
A6Dendix B
Page 9 of 12
under the same project double circuit lines take-off from the same gantries. The
back-bone lines could have been put to maximum use if double bus-bar gantries were
opted at the evaluation stage where offers were tendered for both types. As
mentioned earlier, single bus-bar gantries were selected to cut cost.
(ii) Contract 2
The entire Colombo City MV System is underground. However, the 33-kV supply to
the new Primary Substation at Kirulapone - designated G was planned from a double
circuit overhead line running at the periphery of the city.
It was planned to provide dedicated Grid supply to this Primary Substation through a
double circuit backbone line, from the proposed new Grid Substation at Kolonnawa.
Implementation work of these works is delayed and therefore 33-kV supply to the
-Primary G is provided through a weak link from another Grid Substation.
Total utilization of the Primary Substation G could only be expected after
* commissioning of the Kolonnawa Grid SS and the double circuit line from Kolonnawa
Grid SS.
Further improvements to the 33-kV supply to Primary G could be expected after
commissioning of proposed Kirulapone Grid SS.
The 33-kV cables to the Primary Substation at Kotahena - "Sub H" developed defects
during testing and while on load.
The major problem areas were
(a)    Water ingress into main cable and straight joints
(b)    Sheath damage to main and pilot cables
(c)    Sheath failure at straight joints on main cables
(d)   Insulation failure at pilot cable straight joints.
The cables were repaired and energized and also subjected to a load test. The CEB
agreed to take the cables into normal operation subject to certain assurances and
undertakings by the Contractor. The response was not forthcoming for some time.
Finally these problems were resolved by the Central Disputes Resolution Committee.
Now the CEB is starting pre-comnmissioning tests.

Page 10 of 12
(iii)   Contracts 3, 4, 5 & 7
All Project components under these packages were entrusted for implementation to the
respective Provincial Construction Units. Implementation progress of the Project was
poor due to the following reasons:
*     There had been several instances where the original scope of work had to be
revised to suit the actual requirement of the Province.
*     Simultaneous implementation of several Distribution Projects has resulted in
providing a lesser number of construction gangs for this Project.
*     Priority had been given to new expansion Projects rather than improving the
existing networks.
*     Less cooperation from the public for Projects of this nature.
Considerable progress has been achieved during the last two years and it is now
planned to complete the total scope of work by June 1995.
Each Provincial Office of the CEB has a constructional organization and undertakes
works similar to the Contracts 3, 4 & 5 and other expansion work under the Rural
Electrification. This organization schedules its own construction program depending
on the priorities of the different items of work entrusted to them. Rural
Electrification having a high socio political impact demands for early completion and
quite often these works are completed at the cost of other important system
development works.
This tendency has now been noted by the Borrower on the experience of the delays in
completing the works under Contracts 3. 4 & 5. In future programs separate work
gangs or an identified quantum of constructional capabilities will be dedicated for
development work preventing rural expansion work taking precedence over the system
development work. In completing the balance works Borrower is making
arrangements to dedicate the required manpower to undertake exclusively the balance
works under Contracts 3, 4, 5 & 7.
The Government regulations and the procedures for the procurement of material did
give rise to delays. This was highlighted by the Bank and the present arrangement
stipulated by the Government will reduce the delays.
3.    EVALUATION OF BANK PERFORMANCE
There was no problem in the cash flow to make regular payments to the contractor.
One problem faced was the imposition of UN sanctions on the Yugoslav Contractor
which greatly impeded and restricted his cash flow. To a great extent relief was
forthcoming by releasing local funds as expeditiously as possible. It seems fair to
state that a part reason for non-completion of this project was due to UN sanctions.



40-
Appendix B
Page 11 of 12
Also the Bank was gracious enough to grant extensions to both projects and keep the
payments open to which the client (GOSL/CEB) is very grateful.
The Borrower experienced very strict supervision and adherence to Rules by the Bank
in the procurement process. This quite often led to delays in the procurement. This
was experienced more in the procurement of material under Contract 3, 4, 5 & 7.

& UG Cables and 1138 Nos. of Primary & Distribution Substations coming under the
Project are to be operated and maintained by the CEB in the future. These MV
Lines, LV Lines and Substations that are constructed under the Project are
approximately 16-%, 2% and 13% of the respective works that were maintained by the
CEB in the past. The works that are commissioned under the Project will integrate
with the works in the normal CEB Electricity Distribution System and the same
organizational set up will be responsible for carrying out the maintenance and
operation of the works. The expected yearly cost of maintaining these new works is
approximately 6.5% of the yearly cost of maintaining the CEB Distribution Works
and is expected to be about Rs 70 million per annum compared to Rs 1130 million for
the entire CEB distribution works.
The Project Components that integrate with the CEB Distribution System will be
operated and mnaintained using the CEB's established set up comprising of Deputy
General Managers of Provinces under the Additional General Manager (Distribulion
and Customer Services), Area Engineers under each Deputy General Manager
Province and Operation & Maintenance Staff supervised by Electrical Superintendents
under each Area Engineer.
The details of all the Plant & Equipment are maintained in a Plant & Equipment
Register by each Maintenance Depot and the components on which regular
maintenance has to be carried out are entered in a Depot System Maintenance Register
which is used for maintaining the Quarterly Maintenance work carried out. Work is
planned using schedules of tasks, frequencies, standard gang compositions and work
standards taking remedial action regarding any deficiencies of staff observed, using a
long established set up in the CEB which has been functioning satisfactory.
Progress of maintenance work and the system operations are carefully recorded and
maintained and there is an established reporting system to furnish Management
Information Reports to all those who are in need of these reports based on which
important decision making has to be carried out.

System Operations are carried out by the standby gangs in the Depots with the help of
Primary & Grid Substation Staff and supervised by Electrical Superintendents. A
Central System Control Center for the Island has been established for monitoring all
system operations at 33-kV and above.
II. Training of Staff
Ceylon Electricity Board has an established system of training staff on all aspects of
construction, rehabilitation and maintenance at all levels from the worker categories to
Engineers. These Training Programs are conducted by the Training Center at
Piliyandala and the Training School at Castlereigh
Training Programs were arranged and conducted in utilities in U.K. in methods and
techniques of carrying out proper maintenance and rehabilitation works of the
Distribution System. Consultant from these utilities has trained the CEB Staff in Sri
Lanka in carrying out pilot projects of maintenance and rehabilitation. All necessary
tools, vehicles and other facilities were obtained under the project.
Further training of technical and managerial offices was carried out by the utilities
under the project.
III. Performance Indicators
It is suggested that performance indicators such as reduction in technical power loss in
distribution networks, reduction in the variation of voltage between peak times and off
peak times and the reduction of system outages per month are established. By
monitoring them over a period of 03 years the performance of the Project can be
assessed.
