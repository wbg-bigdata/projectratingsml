                         While the physical rehabilitation of the Social Insurance Institute (SII) archive building has been completed and currently is under final review and acceptance by the SII, no real
                         progress has been achieved in other related key project activities. Although the IT network for the archive was expected to be contracted within July, 2011, the final evaluation report
                         has just been sent for World Bank's review and the contract would be in place by January, 2012; physical rehabilitation works for four selected SII regional offices were contracted
                         only end of November, 2011 (while during the last implementation support mission the contracts were expected to be in place by end of June 2011); after the failure of the

                         procurement process for the furniture of the archive building, the process is still pending and there is no clear date for re-starting the procedures. As result, strong commitment is
                         needed from the SII to improve project implementation pace and overcome all previous delays.
