IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU
SOCIAL AND INFRASTRUCTURE RELIEF PROJECT
(Cr. 2020-GUB and Cr. 2020-1-GUB)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Social and Infrastructure
Relief Project (SIRP) in Guinea Bissau, for which an IDA Credit in the amount of SDR 3.85
million (US$5.0 million) was approved on May 18, 1989 and made effective on October 30,
1989. A Supplemental Credit of SDR 1.95 million (US$2.9 million) was approved on May 5,
1992, and made effective on August 3, 1992.
Funds from IDA Credit 2020-GUB were fully disbursed on December 5, 1991, one and a
half years ahead of schedule, and it was closed on June 30,1993. The Supplemental Credit was
fully disbursed on schedule, on January 14, 1994, and was closed on June 30, 1995. Cofinancing
for this project was provided by Sweden in the form of two grants totaling 30 million Swedish
Kroners (US$4.6 million); Norway, two grants totaling 25 million Norwegian Kroners (US$3.9
million); Portugal, a grant equivalent to US$0.05million, and Japan, a grant equivalent to US$0.3
million.
The ICR was prepared by Leslie J.R. PNan of the Infrastructure Division, Western Africa
Department, Africa Region, and was reviewed by Messrs. Alberto Harth, Division Chief, AF5IN,
and Emmerich Schebeck, Project Advisor, AF5DR.
Preparation of the ICR was begun only after all the cofinancing funds were disbursed on
June 27, 1995, during the final IDA supervision/completion mission from July 29 to August 5,
1995. It is based on materials in the project files and on consultations with IDA staff responsible
for the operation. The Borrower commented on the draft ICR and its views are reflected in the
mission's aide-memoire and its own evaluation.

Development Authority (SIDA)
1.    In 1986 the Government of Guinea-Bissau (GOGB) embarked on a comprehensive
medium-term Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) to place the country on a path to achieve
long-term self-sustained growth. The SAP brought on temporary economic hardships, especially
for the poor and vulnerable groups. The Social Infrastructure Relief Project (SIRP) was
undertaken by GOGB and supported by IDA to improve living conditions of the poor and to
generate employment.
Project Objectives
2.    The overall objective of the Project was to increase income and employment
opportunities among low-income and unemployed urban and rural workers by supporting
activities with high economic and social rates of return. The project, to be implemented over
three years, had the following specific objectives: (a) rehabilitate and maintain essential urban
and social infrastructure, and improve overall sanitary conditions in urban areas; (b) relieve the
acute shortage of urban housing by providing serviced plots; (c) increase the efficienicy of
education and health delivery services focusing, in particular, on essential drugs and support for
the AIDS program; (d) facilitate job placement of laid-off civil servants and other unlemployed;
(e) develop monitoring systems for the social impact of economic policy; and (f) strengthen
Government's capacity to manage and implement SIRP. Project objectives were appropriate and
fully justified given the deteriorating living conditions and higil ullemploymenlt in the country in
the late 1980s.



iii
3.    Special Covenants. In order to implement SIRP, the Borrower agreed to create a
Management Unit (MU) in the Ministry of Planning, a Technical Office (TO) in the Ministry of
Social Infrastructure, and a Bidding Committee composed of representatives of the six ministries
involved in SIRP activities. These were key covenants for project implementation and
sustainability.
Implementation Experience and Results
4.    Three main variances occurred during SIRP implementation: (a) about 30% of the
infrastructure works component, amounting to US$2.4 million in costs, were substituted because
of changes in GOGB priorities or because they were included in other projects; (b) shortfalls in
GOGB counterpartfunds and in donor cofinancing led to a request for IDA to increase its
assistance through a Supplemental Credit of US$2.9 million equivalent; and (c)the SIRP closing
date had to be postponed three times, the first time to December 31, 1993 due to the
Supplemental Credit, the second to December 31, 1994, and, finally, to June 30, 1995, because
of two amendments to the Swedish Grant. Despite the foregoing, IDA funds were disbursed
ahead of schedule.
5.    Employment zeneration was a major achievement of SIRP. Some 138 civil works
subprojects generated about 1,500 person years of employment in the private sector. Of the 580
persons who took training courses in industrial and non-industrial trades, sponsored by the-
Reorientation Unit, 80% found employment. Urban and social infrastructure was rehabilitated.
Socio-economic studies were carried out, and these created a basis for formulating policies and
channeling of resources to deal with problems of housing, employment, and food security.
Implementation capability in civil works was improved by strengthening of local contractors'
administrative and technical experience and the creation of 34 new enterprises. The skills of
local technical staff in the MU and TO were improved by on-thejob training. Initially
dependent on expatriate consultant services, MU and TO staff managed SIRP themselves in its
later phases. The ex-post economic rates of return of 127 % and 42.5 % for markets and road
works, respectively, compare favorably with appraisal estimates of 78.7% and 15 %. SIRP put
in place the institutional capacity and mechanisms for better maintenance and preventive works,
thus assuring employment and avoidance of costly rehabilitation and construction. Without
Government commitment to follow through on maintenance measures, the sustainability of SIRP
investments achievements is uncertain. For example, the future of the garbage collection
program started under SIRP is uncertain as the cost-recovery scheme is yet to be prepared by the
Government.
Bank and Borrower Performance
6.     SIRP was prepared in nine months, a short period given the number of different
components, scattered location of works, and varying funding arrangements of donor agencies.
The Borrower's lack of experience led to reliance on Bank staff and foreign consultants for
project preparation. The project was complex and ambitious in view of the inexperience of the
GOGB implementation agencies and the lack of firm financial commitments from donors. The
Borrower was unrealistic in insisting on reductions in cost estimates during appraisal and the size
of the IDA credit, as proved by the financial constraints that arose during implementation. Initial
problems of coordination between GOGB agencies and with donors as well as others in
procurement and bidding were resolved with the help of IDA supervision. The Borrower did not
provide all the required counterpart funds on a timely basis; the major portion was eventually
obtained through donor grant financing. Considerable effort and time were required to make up



iv
the shortfalls in donor financing and counterpart funds, leading to implementation delays and
cost overruns in components financed by other Donors.
7.    Assessment of Outcome is satisfactory. The overall project outcome is judged
satisfactory for the following reasons: (a) the Government moved away from force account to
contracting out the execution of works and services; (b) SIRP built up experienced and skills in
project management and implementation; (c) SIRP opened new opportunities for the private
secto in public works, commerce and education, and trained and retrained civil servants and
others for jobs in the private and public sectors; (d) basic infrastructure such as roads, markets,
schools, health facilities, sewage canals, drainage systems, and water supply were built or
rehabilitated in several neighborhoods in the capital city and secondary centers, improving
access to services by the urban poor.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
8.    Summary of Findings. SIRP has been a worthwhile investment for not only in
improving public facilities and social services, but also in reducing unemployment and providing
training for laid-off civil servents and young people to obtain skilled and semi-skilled jobs. In
addition, SIRP led to the emergence and consolidation of several building contractors. Without
SIRP it would have been more difficult to prepare and launch the ongoing Transport and Urban
Infrastructure Project (TUIP) implemented through an autonomous AGEOPPE type of an
independent executing agency. The seeds for the tendering of all contracts were planted with
SIRP and the idea is making inroads in the public sector and administration.
9.     Future Operations. The various activities undertaken in SIRP should continue to be
carried out by the respective line ministries responsible for each sector. The encouraging results
of the procurement procedures and contracting-out process introduced have encouraged GOGB
to streamline its methods of operation. GOGB expanded on the approach initiated by SIRP in
the ongoing TUIP to enhance the efficiency of country-wide transport and transit by creating a
commercially run executing agency to implement small works, and using, on a gradual basis, the
revenues of the restructured Road Fund.
10.   Key Lessons learned. The four main lessons learned from SIRP are: (a) Project scope
and preparation. During the appraisal, infrastructure component works should be more carefully
selected and their costs estimated in order to avoid their substitution because of changes in
Government priorities or because they come to be financed under other projects. Given the
special climatic conditions of Guinea-Bissau, it is also very important to make provisions for
cost increases because of the likely further deterioration of infrastructure during the lag time
between appraisal and implementation; (b) Alternatively, a more appropriate lending instrument
for SIRP would have been a program loan. While a multi-sector project may be appropriate for
small countries with an operation only every two or three years, to facilitate implementation, it
would be advisable to (i) define explicitly the criteria for selection of subprojects at appraisal,
and (ii) select carefully the specific investments for the first year with the full agreement of the
Borrower; (c) The project'sfinancingplan should be confirmed as by Negotiation possible.
Only guaranteed donors' support, based on firm commitments, should be counted on before a
project is presented for Board approval. The allocation of counterpart funds should not be
assumed; Government delay in providing counterpart funds on a timely basis should be carefully
evaluated, and measures taken to avoid delays during implementation. The GOGB's poor
financial commitment to SIRP was exacerbated by the lack of continuity in supervision when
Guinea-Bissau was shifted from AF4 to AF5. Better provision should be made by managers and



v
staff for sufficient overlap when a country is shifted from one Bank department to another and;
(d) The project coordination unit should have full authority and responsibility and the various
ministries involved in the project should have high-level representatives in the unit to solve
implementation problems and speed information exchange. If the establishment of coordination
subunits become necessary, they should be clearly subject to the authority of the coordination
unit.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU
SOCIAL AND INFRASTRUCTURE RELIEF PROJECT
(Cr. 2020-GUB and Cr. 2020-1-GUB)
PART I. IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
Background
I .    Following its independence in 1974, Guinea-Bissau faced the task of rebuilding its
economy after a protracted war which dislocated one-fifth of its population, destroyed an
important part of the economic infrastructure, and reduced output of the country's main crops by
over one-third. In the face of a deteriorating economy aggravated by drought and depressed
world market prices for the country's main exports, the Government of Guinea-Bissau (GOGB)
implemented a recovery program which gradually lost momentum and was halted in 1985. In
1986, it embarked on a comprehensive medium-term structural adjustment program (SAP), the
success of which was to place the country in a position to achieve self-sustained growth over the
longer tern. Despite promising medium- to long-term growth prospects, some SAP components
have, in the short term, exacerbated the economic problems of certain vulnerable groups and
impeded sustainability of the recovery program.
2.     Recognizing that the sustainability of the SAP could be endangered by inadequate
attention to the social needs of the country, the Government requested that the international
community support a project to address the transitional costs of implementing the SAP. The
initial involvement of IDA, in response to the urgency for employment generation to meet the
basic needs of the poor and vulnerable groups who have not benefited from the SAP, was under
the Population Health and Nutrition Project (Credit 1800-GUB of 1987) and the Basic Education
Development Project (Credit 1914-GUB of 1988). These projects gave IDA the experience to
act as a catalyst to influence Guinea-Bissau's sector policies, support institutional development,
and help coordinate and refocus other donors programs to improve living conditions of the
vulnerable groups.
3.    The total cost of the Social and Infrastructure Relief Project (SIRP) in 1989 was
estimated at US$17.0 million, with IDA providing a credit of SDR 3.85 (US$5.0 million
equivalent), other donors U$l 1.0 million, and the Government US$1.0 million. Because of a
shortfall in cofinancing and counterpart funds, IDA was requested to provide a Supplemental
Credit of SDR 1.95 million (US$2.9 million equivalent) in March 1992. Additional cofinancing
was also provided by two other donors to cover the shortfall.
A.    Evaluation of Objectives
4.    The overall objective of SIRP was to increase income and employment opportunities
among low-income and unemployed urban and rural workers by supporting activities with high
economic and social rates of return. Specific objectives were to: (a) rehabilitate and maintain
essential urban and social infrastructure, and improve overall sanitary conditions in urban areas;



2
(b) relieve the acute shortage of urban housing by providing serviced plots; (c) increase the
efficiency of education and health delivery services focusing, in particular, on essential drugs
and support for the AIDS program; (d) facilitate job placement of laid-off civil servants and
other unemployed; (e) develop monitoring systems for the social impact of economic policy; and
(f) strengthen Government's capacity to manage and implement SIRP. The objectives were
clear, realistic, and important for the country and in line both with Guinea-Bissau's development
strategy.
5.    To achieve the project objectives, SIRP was designed to finance civil works, consultant
services, studies, procurement, and technical assistance for seven components: (a) maintenance
and rehabilitation of urban and social infrastructure in the capital city of Bissau and other
priority cities; (b) sites and services for 700 low-cost housing plots in Bissau's Antula
neighborhood to provide roads, drainage, water supply, and electricity; (c) educational materials,
supplies, and equipment to complement the ongoing Basic Education Development Project; (d)
health supplies and equipment including drugs, medical supplies, and support for the AIDS
control campaign, including drugs for AIDS-related diseases; (e) support to the Reorientation
Unit for assisting the unemployed; (f) monitoring social dimensions of adjustment; and (g)
technical assistance for project management.
6.     Evaluation of Project Objectives. The objectives of SIRP were appropriate and justified
given the deteriorating living conditions and employment situation in the country in the late
1980s. However, the project design was overly ambitious given the short preparation time and
included too many components in different sectors. Financial problems were inadequately
addressed. The depth of the public finance crisis and the low capacity of the Road Fund to
generate revenues were underestimated, even though the problem of the Government providing
local counterpart funding on a timely basis was identified as a risk in the Staff Appraisal Report
(SAR). Furthermore, the shortfall in donor financing led to considerable implementation delays
and in Government requests for supplemental financing from IDA, Norway, and Sweden.
Tentative commitments for grants from UNDP, UNICEF, and the World Food Programme,
mentioned in the SAR, failed to materialize. The sites and services component had to be
financed outside SIRP because of shortfalls in donor financing. Lack of coordination between
Government agencies involved in project implementation and between the different donors also
affected implementation negatively. The inclusion of a qualitative and quantitative review
process and establishment of the project Management Unit (MU) were useful tools to measure
SIRP's performance and monitor borrower compliance with project agreements.
B.    Achievement of Objectives
7.     The project achieved the overall objective of increasing income and employment
opportunities among low-income and unemployed urban and rural workers and improving the
social infrastructure. With the exception of the sites and services component, which is to be
financed under a project supported by the United Nations Development Programme's Capital
Development Fund (700 plots) and under an ongoing IDA-assisted Infrastructure Rehabilitation
Project (IRP) (230 plots), virtually all project components were satisfactorily implemented.
8.    Maintenance and Rehabilitation of Urban and Social Infrastructure. All works under
this component were contracted out to the private sector and they generated an employment
surge in the local construction industry of more than 1,500 person years. The project supported
over US$8.7 million of works that included maintenance of roads and drainage networks; repair



3
and maintenance of health facilities, primary and secondary schools, and markets; and improved
sanitary facilities. The improvements in markets, roads, drainage, and sanitary facilities
benefited some 400,000 people. Some 210 classrooms in 38 primary schools and 164
classrooms in 10 secondary schools, were rehabilitated at a cost of US$4.1 million, benefiting
about 450,000 schoolchildren. The generation of income and improvements in community
facilities and infrastructure have produced a visible reduction in poverty.
9.    Sites and Services for Low-Cost Housing. This component is being implemented under
other donor-assisted projects, as explained above.
10.   Educational Supplies, Materials, and Equipment. About US$0.6 million in teaching
aids, furniture, and equipment was provided to pre-primary, primary, and secondary schools.
Together with the rehabilitation of dilapidated school physical facilities, the availability of
essential teaching materials and supplies, helped to create a more conducive learning
environment and raised morale among teachers.
11.   Provision of Health Supplies and Equipment. Almost all drugs and equipment planned
for in the project were distributed, although some delays were experienced in their availability
because of logistical and communication problems. Some drugs did not conform to the essential
drugs list of the Ministry of Health. Altogether, US$2.0 million in drugs, training supplies,
logistical support, equipment, and furniture were provided. The AIDS sub-component financed
an essential vehicle for the National Blood Donor Bank and a computer to monitor HIV blood
tests. Seven health facilities were rehabilitated, one more than planned, benefiting an estimated
1 00,000 people.
12.   Support to the Reorientation UnitforAssisting the Unemployed. The Ministry of
Public Function and Labor established a data bank in its newly created Reorientation Unit on
laid-off civil servants and the unemployed, with special emphasis on women and youth.
Training courses were offered to prepare the unemployed for a variety of trade and skilled jobs,
such as an automechanic, carpenter, electrician, stone mason, metal worker, information
specialist, and accountant. Of the 2,000 unemployed civil servants, 240 were retrained; about
260 unemployed student graduates received training; and 20 women were trained in hairdressing,
tailoring, and other non-industrial trades. Altogether some 580 persons were trained, of whom
80% are estimated to have found employment.
13.   Studies Related to the Social Dimension of Adjustment. Several important studies were
completed and many of their recommendations are gradually being implemented. For example,
one study that covered a household survey of 1,500 households formed the basis for the
development of a National Housing Policy. It contains alternative options to establish a national
institutional capacity to provide for the country's housing needs. Other socio-economic studies,
including those on food security, the informal sector, unemployment, and women's
entrepreneurial activities, have enhanced awareness of both the GOGB and its development
partners of the magnitude of the county's problems and should help channel future investments
to deal with them. This component also included skill training programs that benefited 168
persons in nine professional areas.
14.    Technical Assistance to Coordinate and Manage the Project. The MU was established
under the Secretary of State for Planning to coordinate and manage SIRP's operational tasks. A
Technical Office (TO) was created in the Ministry of Public Works to manage the infrastructure



4
components, including the site-development works and the education and health components.
The MU and TO staff and their consultants acquired considerable experience in coordinating the
various project components and contributed significantly to ensuring quality in implementation
of SIRP's physical components. Training and technical assistance was provided for staff in
management, accounting, and office technology. With on-the-ground experience and increased
familiarity with IDA and other donors' procedures, including procurement guidelines, both the
MU and the TO have developed capacity to manage similar project investments in the future.
15.   Environment. The improvements to the drainage and sewer systems had a positive
impact on the environment. A successful garbage collection program for Bissau has also had a
positive impact on the environment. No resettlement was entailed under SIRP.
C.    Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
16.   The original project implementation period was three years, with June 30, 1993 set as the
completion date. The original IDA credit was fully disbursed ahead of schedule by the end of
1991. But it took almost six years from credit effectiveness on October 30, 1989 to project
completion on June 30, 1995, compared with the appraisal estimate of three years. Extension of
project completion for a three-month period until March 1994, and a second extension to June
1995, were necessary to complete disbursement of the IDA Supplemental Credit and the two
Swedish grants. This additional financing was needed to cover shortfalls in project financing
from other donors and GOGB counterpart funding.
17.    The delayed amendment to the Swedish Grant Agreement resulted in low disbursement
levels. The amendment modified the categories of expenditures and introduced a new category
to finance consultants to carry out studies and audits. These changes delayed procurement and
audits, the acquisition and distribution of health equipment and drugs, and financing of GOGB
contributions.
18.    The principal factors affecting implementation were issues of procurement (as described
below), cofinancing, provision of counterpart funds, interagency coordination, and changes in
the project components.
C.1.   Factors Subject to Government Control
19.   Bid evaluation and contract awards were slow initially because they required clearance
from the Presidency through the Ministry of Public Works, Construction, and Urban Affairs
(MOPCU). Under a 1989 Government decree, procurement contracts of more than US$150,000
had to be approved by the Office of the President. However, this procedure was against both the
statute of the SIRP Bidding Committee in the Ministry of Social Infrastructure, which was
responsible for review and evaluation of civil works procurement and contracts, and IDA
procurement guidelines. Difficulties also arose because procurement procedures had not been
well-defined at project start-up and were not well understood by several of the involved parties.
The failure to follow agreed upon procurement rules and procedures led to delays, price
increases, and unnecessary cost overruns amounting to 21 % over appraisal cost estimates. The
procurement process improved with the amendment of the 1989 decree, the results of the Public
Procurement and Supply Study, and an in-country training program carried out for officials
responsible for procurement. MOPCU was initially reluctant to apply penalties for non-



5
performance of contracts and this led to delays: over time this situation improved at the
insistence of the MU.
20.    On-site Supervision of Works was recorded as far below standards. The Government-
selected consulting firm did not have the requisite professional staff to check quality and was
involved in too many activities which affected its competence and judgment. MU and TO staff
and consultants stepped in to help local contractors complete the works with reasonable quality.
The qualitative change in implementation of the physical components can be attributed to the TO
following through on contracted clauses and penalizing non-performers, a step that they were
initially reluctant to take.
21.   Interagency Coordination was lacking because of technical and personal disputes
between the MU, TO, and several of the ministries engaged in implementing SIRP components.
Improved dialogue between the heads of the respective ministries of MU and TO --Ministry of
Planning and MOPCU-- helped to turn things around and led to improved project
implementation. Increased attendance by the MU staff in MOPCU meetings and their growing
familiarity and experience with IDA procedures, led to a qualitative change in the
implementation of the project's physical components. Coordination among the agencies was
later on facilitated by the establishment of a Ministerial Coordinating Committee.
22.   Inadequate Project Funding resulted from GOGB's unrealistically insisting that project
costs to be financed by IDA be reduced from the estimated US$8.0 million to US$5.0 million.
This occurred during the project preparation and appraisal stages. GOGB was also unrealistic in
its assumptions of the amount of project financing that would be forthcoming from donors.
Counterpart funding by GOGB for SIRP was far short of the SAR figure, US$0.167 actual
compared with the US$1.0 million in the SAR. Application for additional external financing
from donors caused significant delays in project implementation and cost increases.
23.    Changes in Priority. Some of the civil works listed in the SAR, including the supply of
690 serviced plots, were substituted because of changes in the Borrower's priorities. The Site
and Services component to be implemented as part of a UNDP/CDF project has experienced
significant delays. Despite Government assurances that the sites would be protected from
unauthorized occupation, unforeseen problems have arisen, such as clandestine construction
work on the sites, quarrying of laterite and crushed stones, and garbage dumping.
C.2.   Factors Not Subject to Government Control
24.    Cofinancing. The inability of GOGB to generate sufficient revenue to meet its financial
contribution obligations for SIRP on a timely basis was recognized at appraisal as a project risk.
The delayed amendment of the Swedish Grant Agreement, modification of the categories of
expenditure, and reallocation of the grant funds among the categories prolonged implementation.
The grant funds were partly needed to finance GOGB's counterpart contributions.
25.    Project Funding Shortfalls. At the preparation and appraisal stages, more attention
should have been paid by IDA staff to defining the project scope and costs in order to avoid the
project being underfunded and the need for efforts later to mobilize additional donor
contributions. The fact that the Borrower was permitted to reduce the initial project costs and the
IDA Credit from US$8.0 million equivalent to US$5.0 million (expecting cofinancing which did



6
not materialize on time) contributed to the financial constraints experienced during
implementation.
D.    Project Sustainability
26.   The sustainability of SIRP's achievements is uncertain. Much will depend on whether
GOGB remains committed to rehabilitation and maintenance of the physical works carried out
under SIRP. The project put into place the institutional capacity and built up the experience that
could in the future enable better maintenance and preventive work, avoid costly rehabilitation
and construction, and assure some employment creation. The involvement of the community,
which is SIRP's major beneficiary, is an important element in sustainability as well, because it
can play a significant role in monitoring and maintenance of the physical infrastructure.
Whether it will do so, will depend on how much the Govemment takes into account community
views in investment decision making.
27.   The future of the garbage collection program begun under SIRP is questionable. The
Government has not been able to devise and implement a viable cost-recovery scheme.
However, a promising initiative that was started under SIRP is now continuing as a private
service to provide satisfactory garbage collection service for some individuals, institutions, and
businesses in Bissau. Road maintenance is another area of concern, as the proceeds of the Road
Fund are far too inadequate to permit timely prevention and repair. SIRP was the beginning of a
dialogue with the GOGB on road improvement; the follow-up IDA-assisted Transport and Urban
Infrastructure Project (TUIP) has introduced some changes in regulations to raise revenues for
maintenance from road users; how well these changes will work remains to be seen. The
tendering of works to building contractors and the use of labor-intensive techniques under SIRP
are positive outcomes that may prove sustainable.
28.   ERRs. The ex-post economic rates of return compare favorably with SAR expectations.
The economic rates of return for market and road improvements estimated during appraisal were
78.7% and 15%, respectively, compared with actual rates of return of 127% and 42.5%.
29.   Capacity building through training of personnel in Government agencies is likely to be
sustainable at least through 2001. The IDA-assisted Infrastructure Rehabilitation and the TUIP
Projects, following on SIRP, have retained, recruited, and further trained personnel who were
earlier engaged in SIRP activities.
E.    Bank Performance
30.   Project Identification. Concern for vulnerable groups and protecting them from the
adverse impacts of structural adjustment was well taken into account by the Bank during project
identification. The project aimed to maintain and rehabilitate physical and social infrastructure
and create employment for the poor and growing number of the unemployed. Project
identification is rated satisfactory.
31.   Project Preparation. Not enough attention was paid to the project scope ard costs,
given the diverse project components, their scattered locations, and the complex funding
arrangements of some of the donor agencies. Due attention would have helped to avoid the
project being underfunded and delayed. Given the short preparation time, the design of project



7
components was complex and ambitious given the lack of experience in the implementing
agencies. Project appraisal is therefore rated deficient.
32.   Project Appraisal. The willingness of other donors to participate in project financing
was overestimated. Staff should have held firm with the Borrower when it was adamant about
reducing the size of the IDA credit with the expectation of grant financing. This would have
avoided the financial constraints SIRP experienced. Project appraisal is rated deficient.
33.   Project Supervision. Supervision assisted the Borrower in establishing the MU and TO
which played key roles in managing and executing SIRP components. It also provided
professional guidance to inexperienced executing agencies and assisted the Borrower in
preparing Terms of Reference for several studies that were carried out. Recognizing the
financial shortfalls, staff expedited the application and approval of the IDA Supplemental Credit
and assisted GOGB in seeking amendment of the Swedish Grant Agreement. However, the
review and approval of the amendment could have been done more expeditiously and thus
reduced delays in project implementation. Supervision missions were instrumental in alleviating
coordination deficiencies between donors and the Government and between the different project
management units, and in helping the executing agencies meet the covenants of both the Credit
and Project Agreements. Project supervision is rated satisfactory.
F.    Borrower Performance
34.   Project Preparation and Appraisal. The Borrower's inexperience in project design and
costs estimation was demonstrated by its insistence on reducing costs even though the project
design was ambitious. The Borrower relied heavily on IDA and foreign consultants during
preparation and appraisal.
3 5.   Project Implementation. Major problems during implementation were caused by the
lack of experience and coordination in procurement and bidding procedures and interference by
the central Government, all of which created problems and delays. GOGB's 1989 procurement
decree, that was beyond the control of the executing agencies, posed a major impediment to
initial project implementation, as mentioned above. The executing agencies' increased
familiarity with IDA procurement procedures, improved dialogue within Government, coupled
with the considerable on-the-job experience, led to a qualitative improvement in the management
and implementation of SIRP's physical components. As the local technicians acquired
experience, the Borrower's implementation capacity increased significantly. During the last two
years of SIRP, the TO and MU Units had only one foreign consultant. The MU kept IDA and
other donors informed on all aspects of project implementation through regular quarterly reports.
Audits were done on time and were unqualified.
36.    The Borrower did not provide all the required counterpart funds. A substantial portion
of these funds was later provided by Sweden.
G.    Assessment of Outcome
37.   The overall project outcome is judged satisfactory, though its sustainability is uncertain.
SIRP opened up new opportunities for private sector firms in public works, commerce, and
education. Basic infrastructure --roads, markets, schools, hospitals, sewage canals, drainage



8
systems, and water supply-- was built or improved in several neighborhoods in the capital city
and secondary centers. SIRP investments not only improved social infrastructure facilities, but
also provided skills and training to several young professionals in running critical sectors of the
economy and relieved growing unemployment. The project contributed to the improved
technical performance of several ministries to execute projects, among them the Ministry of
Public Works, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Public Health, and Ministry of Administrative
Reform (MRAFPT). Studies and surveys undertaken under the project have proved useful in
preparing other projects and lessened reliance on foreign consultants. Some of the studies
dealing with urban poverty, living conditions, and food security were carried out by local
consultants and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), thereby creating additional local
capacity. In addition, SIRP has led to the emergence and consolidation of several building
contractors. The seeds for tendering of all contracts were planted with SIRP and the idea has
taken hold among public sector agencies and has raised expectations among building contractors.
H.    Future Operation
38.    SIRP laid the groundwork for preparing and launching the Transport and Urban
Infrastructure Project (TUIP), which was approved in June 1995. TUIP is to be implemented by
a fully autonomous and independent executing agency, like an AGEOPPE (Guinean Executing
Agency for Public Works and Employment Generation). The encouraging results of the
procurement procedures and contracting out process introduced during SIRP have led the
Government to deepen this approach in TUIP. To enhance the efficiency of country-wide
transport and transit, a commercially run executing agency will implement small works using, on
a gradual basis, the revenues from the restructured Road Fund.
..     Key Lessons Learned
39.    There are four main lessons to be learned from SIRP:
(i)  Project scope and preparation. The selection of rehabilitation works and their cost
evaluation must be carefully done during appraisal; the substitution of the works
later should be avoided, whether because Government changes its priorities or
because they could be taken up in other projects. Given the special climatic
conditions in Guinea-Bissau, it is also important to make provisions for cost
increases because of the likely further deterioration of infrastructure during the lag
time between appraisal and implementation.
(ii)  Only guaranteed donors' support, based on firm commitments, should be counted
on in the project's financing plan before a project is presented for Board approval.
The allocation of counterpartfunds for the project should not be assumed.
Government delay in providing the counterpart funds on a timely basis should be
carefully evaluated, and measures should be taken to avoid delays during
implementation. The GOGB's poor financial commitment to SIRP was
exacerbated by the lack of continuity in supervision when Guinea-Bissau was
shifted from AF4 to AF5. Better provision should be made by managers and staff
for sufficient overlap when a country is shifted from one Bank department to
another.



9
(iii) The project coordination unit should have full authority and responsibility and the
various ministries involved in the project should have high-level representatives in
the unit to solve implementation problems and speed up information exchange. If
establishment of sub-units become necessary, they should be clearly subject to the
authority of the coordination unit
(iv)  A more appropriate lending instrument for SIRP would have been a program loan,
with its built-in flexibility but with specific criteria for project selection. While a
multi-sectoral project may be appropriate for small countries with an operation
only every two or three years, to facilitate implementation, it would be advisable
to (a) define explicitly the criteria for selection of subprojects at appraisal, and (b)
select carefully the specific investments for the first year of the project, with the
full agreement of the Borrower.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Item 7 of the aide-memoire drawn up by the IDA mission of August 1995 recommends
that the Implementation Completion Report on this project include a chapter (No. II) from the
Government itself consisting of:
the Government's assessment of its own performance as Borrower in the project
execution process, with special emphasis on lessons learned which should be
taken into account in the execution of future projects;
an appraisal of the relationship linking the Government, the Bank and co-
financers during the course of the project;
an assessment of the performance of project co-financers.
It is the Government's intention in this chapter to give as objective as possible a
stocktaking of the outcome of the project, in light of (a) the statement of objectives contained in
the SAR of April 1989, and (b) the roles played by the various parties to the project.
A.    Government Performance
Appraisal of the economic aspects of the project was conducted according to Bank
guidelines, which ensured that the decisions arrived at regarding project goals were impartial and
objective. The ex-post evaluation the Government gives here is based on qualitative information
obtained from project beneficiaries and co-financiers, and also on the schedule of project
activities given in SAR No. 7606-GUB, dated April 19, 1989.
Although the goals set in the SAR are not the preferred indicators in this type of
assessment, it may be noted that level of mobilization of financial resources and timing of
disbursements were on a par with SAR projections. Similarly, it is estimated that all activities
provided for in the SAR were fully implemented, and that respective terms of reference and
budgets were adhered to. Accordingly, the Government believes a frankly positive performance
assessment is warranted here.
It is therefore considered most important that the experience acquired through SIRP -
particularly the appraisal methodology followed and the execution and monitoring procedures
employed - be regarded by both the Government and co-financers as relevant to the
implementation of future projects.

Page 4 of 6
The project outcome is the result of a combination of factors occurring as part of the
project cycle, but the Government wishes to call particular attention to the following:
I .    Integration of project objectives with the Government's priority policies and
development strategy, through actions targeting the social sectors and population groups
considered vulnerable to SAP impact. For instance:
(i)   rehabilitation of economic and social infrastructure (health, education,
water supply and sanitation, community facilities), in order to improve the
standard of living for families and facilitate their access to the fundamental
benefits of development;
(ii)   promotion of employment for young people, women, and laid-off civil
servants;
(iii)  strengthening of the national economic base;
(iv)  improved distribution of national output;
(v)   basic and advanced training for local professionals in project management
and monitoring techniques;
(vi)  promotion of balanced regional development, through extension of the
benefits of the project to all provinces.
2.    Identification of priority action programs based on the use of public opinion
survey findings and selection criteria geared to the nature and objectives of the project.
3.    The time and resources invested in the preparation phase of the project resulted in
creation of the institutional, technical, and financial conditions essential for its successful
execution. For instance:
(i)   establishment of the basic departmental and agency structures, together
with definition of the functions of their component divisions;
(ii)   provision of good working conditions - in the form of the logistics,
premises, equipment, and supplies required for smooth operation;
(iii)  appointment of stable work teams, which took part in all phases of the
project (design and appraisal, negotiations, implementation); team members were
selected for their competence, capacity for initiative, and strong contractual links
to the project; in view of the technical demands made on them and the level of
responsibility they were required to assume, the Government opted for a
commensurate remuneration policy so that the project would elicit their full
commitment;



23                                Annex I
Page 5 of 6
(iv)   announcement of Credit effectiveness once the administrative, technical,
and financial conditions specified in the Credit Agreement had been met;
considering the prevailing financial restrictions, the Government regards the
conditions imposed as having been too demanding;
(v)   distribution of information on the project to potential sources of financing,
with the World Bank serving as persuasive advocate and catalyst, instilling the
degree of confidence essential in securing donor commitment to the project;
(vi)  drawing up of timetables covering both physical and financial
implementation of the project.
4.    Implementation methods were based on a management-by-objectives strategy, a
fact which warrants the following observations on this phase of the project cycle:
(i)   SIRP execution followed an iterative process in which the operating
strategy employed underwent a series of adaptations as experience accumulated
and new situations presented themselves, as familiarity with Bank procedures
increased, and as coordination between teams in the field and at Bank
headquarters improved. The focus at all times was on project objectives, and on
requests for actions not provided for in the project design but which allowed new
problems to be solved in a manner consistent with the basic approach and aims of
the project.
(ii)   Obstacles encountered were dealt with through dialogue and usually on a
consensus basis, but without relieving the parties of their assigned functions and
responsibilities. However, in our view, the driving force throughout the project
was the Government's insistence on coordination and on vigorous pursuit of all
project components. In both these spheres, credit for much that was achieved
belongs to the Inter-ministerial Committee, the frequent meetings held to ensure
good component-to-component coordination, and the emphasis placed on
harmonization of technical, financial, and institutional factors. The attention paid
to coordination resulted in development of a strong team spirit among those
working on the various project components, so that when critical situations
presented themselves an atmosphere of mutual support and help prevailed.
(iii)   Dissemination of information on decisions and other matters facilitated
monitoring of the execution process and prompt action to keep project
components on schedule.
(iv)   Enumeration in the quarterly progress reports of goals achieved made it
possible to evaluate work team performance.
(v)   Timely action vis-a-vis co-financers, involving presentation of materials
designed to attract financing, helped avoid the interruptions in funding that would



24                                Annexl
Page 6 of 6
have led to failure by the Government to meet it contractual obligations, with all
the attendant financial costs and harm to the project image.
(vi)  Creation of public awareness of and support for the project, through
sensitization campaigns and regular dissemination of publicity information on
achievements and phases completed.
(vii)  The introduction and use of integrated information systems, in conjunction
with comprehensive physical and financial monitoring, provided a basis for
permanent evaluation not only of progress with project implementation as a whole
but also of deviations from the SAR and projected quarterly work programs and
budgets.
Reliance on double-entry bookkeeping allowed disbursements to be classified by
expenditure category and beneficiaries to be classified by component. The fact that this
accounting method affords such a broad range of both financial and economic information
clearly warrants its use with similar projects.
B.   Relationships with Suppliers, Consultants, and Contractors
Rules and procedures to govern dealings with third parties were drawn up and embodied
in contracts stipulating scope of action, execution periods, obligations and rights of the parties,
penalties for unsubstantiated failure to meet specified deadlines, etc.
Third parties were required to: possess recognizable legal status; be current with their
obligations to the tax authorities and the social security system; hold all mandatory business and
construction licenses and permits; produce vouchers in the form of supplier invoices, receipts,
acknowledgments of security deposits, etc.
Notwithstanding the relative efficiency of available means of communication, the
Government believes greater autonomy should be granted in the execution of actions provided
for in the SAR, since this would reduce execution periods and lower both operating and technical
assistance costs.
The Government also takes the view that in future projects, so that hindrances of this type
can be eliminated, SARs should be more detailed when specifying types of action and sums of
money subject to the "no objection" requirement.
Although execution of the SIRP has resulted in some progress in standardizing
procedures associated with financial resource access criteria and administrative conditions, the
Government is of the opinion that co-financers need to make a concerted effort to harmonize
their requirements. This would enable the Government to formulate integrated programs of the
SIRP type, and in addition to promoting more rational resource use would ensure fuller
achievement of objectives.

AIDE -MEMOIRE
SOCIAL AND INFRASTRUCTURE RELIEF PROJECT: SIRP
IDA MISSION: JULY 29-AUGUST 5, 1995
1.    The final IDA supervision mission for the SIRP, consisting of Mr. Lubomir F.
Dunin (consultant architect) and Mr. Leslie Pean (SIRP Task Manager), visited Guinea-
Bissau from July 29 to August 5, 1995. The mission wishes to thank the representatives
of the Government for the high standard of cooperation and assistance they provided for
the mission. The main comments and conclusions arising from the contacts and
discussions between the Government authorities and the mission are presented below.
INFRASTRUCTURE REHABILITATION
2.    The mission was informed that the repairs to Bolama Hospital carried out on
contract by Joaozinho Correia had been completed in December. The 10% performance
payment had also been made, so that all expenditures relating to this component had now
been completed.
The mission was informed that -- as a result of the transfer ordered by the court
hearing the suit for debt recovery filed against the contractor Urbagui -- the project had
recovered the amount of US$16,163.02 in the form of materials (such as doors, windows,
etc.) and that these would be used by the new contractor. Repayment of the balance is
expected once the court has reached its final decision.
FINANCIAL STATUS OF THE PROJECT
3.    The mission was informed that the SIRP had examined the current accounts
relating to suppliers and contractors and that all outstanding payments had been settled,
including those relating to the 10% performance guarantees.
PLANNED STUDIES
4.    The mission was informed that all planned SIRP studies had been completed, and
that the relevant payments had been made.
HEALTH
5.    The mission was informed that, even though the validity of the letter of credit
granted to the supplier on October 24, 1994 had been extended to the end of April 1995,
not all of the essential drugs that were to be provided under the contract awarded after



26
Annex 2
Page 2 of 3
international competitive bidding in February 1993 had yet been supplied, but that the
supplier had promised to deliver the missing items in August 1995.
The mission was also informed that on January 9, 1995 the Management Unit had
called upon Banco Trotta & Acores (BTA) to request the Mees Pierson Bank to extend its
guarantee to March 31, 1995. However, on January 31. 1995 Mees Pierson sent a telex to
BTA indicating that the guarantee would be terminated on January 31, 1995 and asking to
be formally released from the terms of the guarantee.
Since the guarantee had not been renewed within the stipulated period, BTA sent
a fax to Mees Pierson on January 31, 1995 stating that it was putting the guarantee into
effect, to the value of NLG 41,494.30, and requesting that this amount be credited to its
account in Lisbon. On April 14, 1995, BTA informed the SIRP Management Unit that so
far Mees Pierson had not credited the amount of the guarantee to its account, and that
consequently it was going to request payment once again.
On April 18, 1995, the Project Support company contacted the Management Unit,
insisting that the missing drugs would be delivered promptly, and calling on the Unit to
have BTA request Mees Pierson to cancel repayment of the guarantee.
Finally, on April 24, 1995, the SIRP Management Unit -- after consulting the
Ministry of Health -- informed BTA that, in light of the importance to the country of the
undelivered drugs, and in the interests of the project, it would agree to the proposal, on
condition that Mees Pierson would agree within 48 hours to provide the same guarantee
conditions for a period extending up to June 24, 1995; if not, payment was to be made for
the guarantee under the same terms as had been established when it was put into effect on
January 31, 1995. The deadline was reached without Project Support keeping its
promise, after submitting a further application that the period be extended. This was
rejected by the Government.
The mission was informed that, because of the time left before the project's
closing date, the SIRP Management Unit had applied to IBRD Disbursements to pay the
total amount outstanding (NLG 24,607.51). However, in order to safeguard the project if
the missing drugs were not supplied, it requested BTA to arrange with the supplier's bank
for the 10% performance guarantee to be put into effect. It will be returnable to the
supplier only after the drugs in question have been delivered.
AUDITS
6.    The Ernst & Young audit report on project expenditure accounts as of March 31,
1995 had been forwarded to the World Bank.
Because some expenditures were made after March 31, 1995, the final audit
