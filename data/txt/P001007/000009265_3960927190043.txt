MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU
FOR A SOCIAL AND INFRASTRUCTURE RELIEF PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Guinea-Bissau for SDR 3.85 million
(US$5.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval.  The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity and would help
finance a Social and Infrastructure Relief Project. The Project would be
cofinanced by other donors for SDR 8.40 million (US$11.0 million
equivalent).
2.        Background.  Since independence in 1974, Guinea-Bissau has faced
the major task of rebuilding its economy which was heavily damaged during
the war of independence. The combination of excessive centralization and
weakness of the administration had resulted in a deep economic and
financial crisis. To correct this situation, the Government has recently
embarked on a comprehensive Structurzl Adjustment Program (SAP) with the
objectives of liberalizing trade, introducing more restrained fiscal
policies and production incentives, correcting foreign exchange disparity
and other market-oriented measures. The SAP is supported by an IDA
Structural Adjustment Credit, an IMF Structural Adjustment Facility and
other bilateral and multilateral donor assistance, and has started
producing positive efiects. However, because the economic crisis was so
widespread and profound, the benefits of the SAP have not yet been felt by
certain vulnerable groups. These include low-income and underemployed
urban households, retrenched workers from the public and private sectors,
and small farmers, mainly in rural areas, whose productivity is low and who
face unemployment during the lean season. Among the vulnerable groups,
women and children have borne the brunt of prolonged economLc stagnation.
3.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Association4s recent
involvement in the health and education sectors, and earlier involvement in
the infrastructure sector has given it the experience to act as a catalyst
in coordinating donor involvement, influencing sector policies, and
supporting institutional development. Other agencies and donors have
indicated a willingness to refocus their own programs to better support
vulnerable groups, given Bank Group leadership. Improved donor
coordination will also enhance the Government's absorptive capacity and its
ability to implement such programs.
4.        Proiect Obiectives.  The overall objective of the project would
be to increase income and employment opportunities among low income and
unemployed urban and rural workers through support of activities having
high economic and social rates of return.
5.        Project Description. The Project components ares (a) Infra-
structure including maintenance of roads and drainage networks in urban
areas; repair and maintenance of urban and rural comuunity facilities



-2-
including health facilities, primary and secondary schools and markets; and
improvement of sanitary conditions including repairs to sewerage systems
and water supply networks; (b) Site Development for low-cost urban housing;
tc) Education including basic teaching aids, class-room furniture; and
materials/utensils for the school meal program in Bissau; td) Health
including essential drugs and medical supplies; educational materials,
supplies and technical support for a program to train health care workers
in prescribing and dispensing drugs; support for the AIDS campaign and
assistance to the National Blood Donor Bank; and provision of furniture,
supplies and equipment for those health facilities to be rehabilitated
under the Project; te) Reorientation Program involving a data bank to
provide information on employment opportunities generated under the Project
for laid-off civil servants and the unemployed, and training and basic
equipment to assist redundant civil servants in starting micro businesses;
(f) Monitoring and Evaluation of the social impact of the SAP through a
series of socio-economic studies; and tg) Technical Assistance including
training to strengthen the Government's executing capacity to identify,
desip, and implement the above components.
6.        Coordination of all operational aspects of the Project will be
carried out by a Management Unit (MU) established under the Ministry of
Planning (MP). The MP will also have responsibility for the monitoring of
the social impact of the SAP referred to above. A Technical Office (TO)
established under the Ministry of Social Infrastructure will manage the
infrastructure component including the site development works under the
Project, and the education and health components will be implemented by the
Ministries of Education and Public Health, respectively. The Ministry of
Public Function and Labor, through a Reorientation Unit, will carry out the
Reorientation Program.
7.        The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$17 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$12.8 million (75Z of
total cost). A breakdown of costs and financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Guinea-Biosau are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also
attached as well as a Staff Appraisal Report No. 7606-GUB dated April 19,
1989.
8.        Agreed Actions.  Agreement has been reached with the Government
on: (a) the terms of reference for consultancy services under the MU and
the TO; (b) the terms of reference for the Bidding Committee for the
infrastructure contracts as well as procedures for procurement and
disbursement under the Projects (c) preparing quarterly progress reports;
(d) conducting annual project implementation review meetings beginning
September 30, 1990; and (e) carrying out a socio-economic survey pertaining
to site development under the Project, and cost recovery measures for the
provision of serviced housing plots. Conditions of Effectiveness are: (a)
appointment of a Project Coordinator (already in the field), an Accountant



-3-
and a Procurement Specialist for the MU; (b) appointment of a Contract
Specialist, a Supervision Engineer and an Accountant for the TO; and (c)
establishment of a project account in a local comuercial Bank for
counterpart funds, with an initial deposit of US$50,000, equivalent.
9.        Benefits.  The Project will help generate directly or indirectly
some 2,050 man years of employment over the 1990-93 Project implementation
period. Project benefits would include rehabilitation and maintenance of
urban and social infrastructure which would lead to improved overall
sanitary and environmental conditions, an expanded supply of sites and
services for low-cost housing, improved quality and availability of health
and education services, and job placement opportunities, through the
Reorientation Program, for redundant civil servants as a result of the
restructuring of the civil service under the SAP. The employment
opportunities generated under the proposed Project will be sustained
through a follow-on labor-intensive Infrastructure Relief Proyect expected
to be implemented during 1990-95. The internal economic rate of return
(ERR) for the infrastructure component is estimated to be 33Z. For those
components where it is not practical to calculate an ERR, evaluations were
made based on qualitative assessments of economic and social benefits.
10.       Risks.  The main risks are thats (i) the implementation
capability of the executing agencies may be overtaxed in the short run,
leading to implementation delays and difficulties in supervision and
financial control; (ii) the Government may find it difficult to provide
local counterpart funding on a timely basis; and (iii) the urgency for
employment generation could increase the possibility that some project
components may not be properly appraised. However, the MU has already
hired a competent Project Coordinator, and is in the process of recruiting
other key officers to alleviate the problem of weak implementation
capacity. The opening of a project account for counterpart funds with
payments made in advance--the first quarterly contribution being a
condition of effectiveness--will establish an administrative system to
ensure timely allocation of the Government's contribution to the Project.
Furthermore, counterpart funding needs would be considered in the Public
Expeuditure Program which will be reviewed on an annual basis under the
Structural Adjustment Credit. Evaluation of subprojects would be done by
consultants and supervised by the MU and periodic IDA supervision missions.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
