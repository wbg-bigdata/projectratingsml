MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN OF US$22.3 MILLION
TO REPUBLICA ORIENTAL DEL URUGUAY
FOR A WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Republica Oriental del Uruguay for US$22.3 million equivalent is submitted
for approval.   The proposed loan would be for a period of 17 years,
including 4 years of grace at the Bank's standard variatle rate. The
Borrower will make available the proceeds of the Loan to Administracion de
las Obras Sanitarias del Estado (OSE), as project executing agency, on the
same terms and conditions as those of the Loan.
2.          Background.  The water and sanitation sector in Uruguay has a
long tradition and it was, until some years ago, among the most developed
in Latin America. The Montevideo water and sewer systems were established
more than a century ago by foreign-owned companies.  Service coverage and
quality were high and pricing policies were adequate to generate enough
revenues to cover operations and maintenance, to finance system replacement
and expansion, and to provide a return on capital to private investors.
in the 1950s the sector was restructured and sector policies were changed.
The services were transferred from the private sector to a state
decentralized service, Administracion de las Obras Sanitarias del Estado
(OSE), and to the Municipality of Montevideo (OSE provides for water
services in all the country, and sewer services in cities other than
Montevideo).    OSE,  in  turn,  was  used  as  an  instrument  of  income
distribution and fiscal policy at the expense of economic and technological
efficiency:  (i)  tariffs  were  held  below  the  cost  of  services;  (ii)
overemployment, together with the payment of non-competitive salaries to
qualified personnel, was encouraged; and (iii) operation, maintenance and
investment budgets were tailored to the sector's financial constraints and
Government's changing fiscal situation rather than io the requirements of
orderly sector development.
3.         Service coverage is still adequate.  In 1986, about 83% of the
urban and 27% of the rural population had domestic water connections, and
63% of the urban and 20% of the rural population was served by public
sewerage. The rest of the population had access to acceptable alternative
systems.     Infrastructure  is  antiquated,  however,  and  in  need  of
modernization, reflecting insufficient budgets over the last 30 years for
system  maintenance,  rehabilitation  and  replacement.       This  structure
threatens the quality and coverage of service. The present Government and
OSE's Board and Management, however, are fully aware of the need to change
policies and practices, and are determined to implement new ones, including
restructuring OSE and introducing adequate cost recovery policies. Actions
already taken in this direction include the carrying out of a first
twinning contract with a Brazilian water company (SANEPAR) and increasing
tariffs to a satisfactory level.   In addition, OSE's Board and its top
management team are made up of qualified professionals.

4.           Rationale for Bank Involvement.   A key aspect of the Bank's
strategy in Uruguay is to pursue structural and financial reform of public
enterprises. To this effect, this first Bank-financed project in the water
and sanitation sector in Uruguay would assist the Government in improving
operations and achieving full financial viability for OSE, which has
required Government  transfers on a sustained basis.   In addition,  the
technical assistance component is designed to focus the Government and OSE
on the development and implementation of a long-term sector development
strategy. Later projects could shift emphasis toward system expansion.
Bank involvement, both financial and technical, is important for the con-
tinued success of this strategy. Also, the initiation of OSE's restructur-
ing, including staff reductions, is a condition for Second Tranche dis-
bursements (scheduled for July 1988) under the First Structural Adjustment
Loan, approved by the Board in June 1987.
5.           Project Objectives.   The proposed project, in line with the
Government and OSE's policies, would help to modernize and restructure OSE,
aiming at reducing operating costs and increasing productivity, thus enabl-
ing the entity to operate without subsidies and to provide services to low
income groups at affordable prices. Other specific project objectives com-
prise: (A) meeting short- to medium-term water demand by increasing the
output of existing Infrastructure through system rehabilitation and im-
proved maintenance practices; (B) improving water quality and service reli-
ability; (C) improving OSE's financial performance by reducing recurrent
costs, particularly through increased labor productivity, and staff reduc-
tions; and (D) implementing a revised sector strategy, including cost re-
covery policies and a cost-effective investment plan.
6.          Project Description.   The proposed project would include four
components: (A) Institutional Development (7Z of project cost), consisting
of: (i) technical cooperation and training through a corporate twinning ar-
rangement with a highly effective and efficient water utility; and (ii)
technical cooperation for planning and coordinating project execution; (B)
Rehabilitation of Water Supply Systems (85%), consisting of: (i) upgrading
the Montevideo water treatment plant to increase its production capacity by
about 20%, and to improve water quality and reliability of service; (ii)
restoring the capacity of two transmission mains from the treatment plant
to Montevideo reservoirs; (iii) repairing and replacing deteriorated
equipment and installations in the production and distribution systems of
Montevideo and of several medium-size cities; and (iv) purchasing and
installing operation and maintenance equipment, water meters, and support
equipment for OSE's operations; (C) Expansion of Montevideo Distribution
System (3%), consisting of constructing water distribution networks, house
connections and standpipes to serve 5,000 low-income families; and (D)
Preparation of OSE's Water Supply and Sanitation Plan (5%), consisting of
the development of:  (i) a cost-effective investment plan for 1990-95 to
meet the demand for water and sewer services in the long-term; (ii) a
viable tariff policy and financing plan; and (iii) a manpower plan for the
sector.



-3-
7.          T'he overall direction and supervision of project implementation
would be carried out by a committee (the Committee) integrated by OSE's
President,  the General Manager, and a Project Director.   The day-to-day
activities under the p'roject would be carried out by OSE's operating
departments with the assistance of the twinning company. This organization
is an element of the project design that significantly enhances the
prospects of successful project implementation since it:  (i) reflects the
support to the project from the highest levels of OSE's management; (ii)
maximizes staff participation; and (iii) allows OSE to draw upon the
in-house resources of the twinning company in addressing OSE's needs in a
pragmatic and entrepreneurial manner.   The Project Director is a highly
qualified professional.
8.         Agreed Actions.  The Government and OSE have agreed on the fol-
lowing: (i) an overall action plan for OSE's institutional development,
including the twinning arrangement and related training, and annual per-
formance targets, during the project execution period (1988-95), which
would include decreasing the number of employees per 1,000 water
connections (from 12.6 to 9.4), decreasing total personnel costs (from 60%
of operating costs  in  1988 to 57Z in  1995),  increasing the number of
connections with working meters (from 88% to 94%), and reducing the level
of accounts receivable from the equivalent of 3.2 months of sales in 1988
to 2.5 months of sales in 1991 and maintaining it thereafter; (ii) the
submission to the Bank by September 30 of each year, starting in 1988, of
yearly action plans for institutional development with emphasis on the
selection of the medium-size cities in which OSE would carry out
investments, the activities to be carried out, and the amounts to be
invested; (iii) actions which would ensure that OSE generates enough
revenues to cover operation and maintenance expenditures, debt service,
working capital needs, required profit distributions, and at least 30% of
its capital expenditures; (iv) maintaining a current ratio of not less than
2.5, and reducing the working ratio from 81% to 70%; (v) the implementation
of a new tariff system by December 31, 1990; (vi) maintaining, during the
life  of  the  project,  the  Committee  and  a  Project  Director  whose
qualifications are acceptable to the Bank; and (vii) measures necessary to
strengthen OSE's personnel management and staffing policies, including
submission, if necess.ry, of draft legislation to Congress by June 30,
1989.
9.         Benefits.  The project would enable OSE to satisfy water demand
in Montevideo at least to the year 2000, to extend services to low-income
areas, to increase water availability in several medium-size cities, and to
provide services at affordable prices. The project would directly benefit
an additional population of about 175,000 in Montevideo and 58,000 in other
cities.   Failure  to execute the project  could result  in:   (i) severe
interruptions in water supply services in Montevideo as a result of
structural collapse or drastic capac.ity reduction of some water treatment
installations and transmission mains, which have been in service for a long
time and have not been adequately operated and maintained; and (ii)
increasing water losses, with the consequent need for larger investments.
The internal rate of return is estimated to be 25% for the entire project
and 26% for the Montevideo project component alone.

10.        Risks.  The main project risk is possible opposition to some of
the politically difficult changes proposed, especially staff reductions and
required changes in OSE's regulations for personnel management.   However,
the probability of success is reasonable given the Government's and OSE
commitment to the project goals, and the Government's success in
implementing cost reduction programs in other enterprises.   In addition,
the fiscal constraints faced by the Government would encourage the
authorities to pursue policies which will eliminate transfers to the
sector, and to help OSE to reach financial sel; sufficiency. Another risk
concerns staff resistance to changes in working practices.   The project
design reduces this risk by introducing a twinning arrangement with
frequent contacts between the mentor institution's staff and OSE
couaterparts. Also, OSE's strategy for institutional development includes
close consultation and collaboration with the union, and a gradualistic
approach to reform.
11.         Recommendation:   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
