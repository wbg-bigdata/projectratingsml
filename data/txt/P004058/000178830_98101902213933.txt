INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF nlE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Korea for the equivalent of US$47.0 million to
help finance a second highways project. The loan would have a term of 25
years, including seven years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report ("Economic Situation and Prospects
of the Republic of Korea" EAP-33a) was distributed under cover of R72-243,
dated November 9, 1972. The Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex I.
An Economic Mission was in the field during September-October 1973, and
is now preparing its report.
3.        Korea's economic record during the last decade has undoubtedly
been one of the most impressive among the developing countries. The GNP
growth, in constant 1970 prices, averaged 9.5 percent per annum during
1963-72 and average per capita income during 1972 at around $300 was in
real terms more than double the level of ten years ago. The unusually
rapid increase in per capita income was, of course, mainly due to the
large gains in output but it was facilitated by a sharp decline in the
rate of population growth from nearly three percent in the early sixties
to less than two percent at present. A key element in the rapid expansion
of the Korean economy has been the growth of manufactured goods exports
from less than $10 million in 1962 to $1,365 million in 1972. Manufactured
exports which provide 85 percent of merchandise exports, now constitute
about 25 percent of manufactured output. The structural change in the
Korean economy is also highlighted by the sharp rise in the ratio of
manufacturing output to GNP which now stands at 26 percent and exceeds
the share of agriculture. Under the impetus of sharply rising manufactured
goods exports, the ratio of exports to GNP rose steadily to 22 percent
in 1972 as compared to less than 4 percent a decade earlier. At the same
time real investment has shown phenomenal growth; the ratio of fixed
capital investment formation to GN? which was only around 9 percent
during 1960-62 rose to an average of about 23 percent during 1970-72.
4.        The rapid growth which has transformed the Korean economy
from the sluggish agricultural-rural pattern of the post-Korean war years
to the dynamic semi-industrialized pattern of the present has not, however,
been without its problems. Korea began to face serious resource management
problems toward the end of the sixties because the heavy investment required
to sustain rapid economic growth was well beyond her own saving capability.
The savings-investment gap, which was quite large to begin with (foreign
savings averaged 7-8 percent of GNP during 1964-66), widened towards the



end of the sixties to 11-12 percent of GNP. Even though the marginal
savings rate dur-ing the last decade was close to 25 percent, the deficits
o-n he goods and services account expanded rapidly and had to be financed
by large external borrowings. The ratio of debt service payments to
foreigni exchange receipts increased rather sharply during the sixties
to reach a peak of 19.4 percent in 1971 due, in part, to excessive
reliance on suppliers' credits during 1965-70. During 1970-72, the Govern-
ment took a nimber of measures to reduce the rate of increase of investment,
to curb further expansiona in foreign capital requirements and to improve
generally the balance of pavments    These measures included the gradual
adjustment of the exchange rate from around 300 Won per US dollar in the
beginning of 1970 to 400 Won per US dollar by the middle of 1972, restric-
tions on suppliers' credits and Jiimitations on the expansion of domestic
credit.  They produced a definite slowdown- in the economy; the GNP growth
averaged only 8 percent per annum durlng 1970-72 compared with nearly
12 percent per annmm in the preceding three years.    Real investment
stagnared during 1970-72 and the ratio of fixed investment dropped
sharply from 27 percen. of GNP in 1969 to 21 percent in 1972.    The
general economic slowdown. did nor, however, result in an abatement of
inflationary pressures and the Government therefore took a series of
further measures to cheeck inflation and, at the same time, to moderate
the disruptive financial imnpact of thie economic slowdown on the business
sector.
5.        The impact of these stabilization measures on reducing inflation
as well as on business attitudes about future price levels has been very
considerable. External factors have also played a crucial role during
the last twelve months in mitigating the financial strains of the past few
years.
6.        Even by Korean standards, 1973 promises to be an excentional
year and may rival 1969 in setting new records of growth rates in GNP,
exports and investments.   According to the Economic M7ission's provisional
estimates real GNP growth during 1973 mav be as hi`h as 15 percent.     The
major factors in the sharp upturn of economic activity since the second
half of 1972 have been an unprecedented growth in exports, and more
recentlv, a marked revival in fixed inves.ment.    Merchandise exports
during 1973 may rise by 65-75 percent compared to last year.    It seems
that at least one third oL the gain in the value of exnorts in 1973 is
due to higher prices reflecting both worldwide inflation and further decline
in the value of the US dollar.   But the gain in export volume may be as much
as 50 percent.   Exnorts to Japan in tIhe first half of 1973 were nearly
three times those in the corresDonding period OL 1972. Exports to Europe
have also expar,ded very fast since 1971 and exports to the US have grown
as well.  Real fixed investmert, which showed very little increase during
the last three years, will probably increase by 30 percent this year.    The
national saving rate, whnich had dropped to about 15 percent in 1972, is also
likely to recover to around 17-18 percent, the level reached in 1969.
Even though the steep rise in import prices of foodgrains, raw materials and
fuels and a sharp expansiorn in machi-nery imports, will result in an
unparalleled import growth of 65 percent during 1973, the goods and services



- 3 -
account deficit will be only in the order of 6 percent of GNP compared with
11 percent in 1970-71.
7.        It is noteworthy that record economic expansion has been achieved
with less inflation than in 1970-72. W4holesale prices, according to
official statistics, were irn September 1973 about 6 percent higher than a
year ago. However, in view of the extensive price controls, official price
indices understate the extent of price pressures. Furthermore, since
August the price increases have accelerated and for the calendar year 1973
a rise in the wholesale price index of 8 percent is likely. But the
upheaval in the world commodity markets in the first half of 1973 and the
persistence -- even acceleration -- of price pressures in the U.S. and
Japan, Korea's major trade partners, have resulted in considerable imported
inflation in Korea. These developments could not have been foreseen when
the target of limiting price increase to 3 percent was adopted last year.
8.        The remarkable performance of the economy in 1973 has quite
evidently increased the confidence both in business and Government with
which the future is viewed. At least before the energy crisis developed,
the Government planned to pursue vigorously its long-term targets of $1,000
per capita income and $10 billion exports by the early 1980s. The long-term
strategy envisaged is essentially an extension of the growth path Korea has
so successfully followed in the past decade. The overall growth rate of
GNP of about 10 percent, achieved during the sixties, is to be maintained
over the next ten years. This is to be achieved, as in the past, through
a more rapid expansion of exports than that of GNP. The ratio of exports
to GNP is projected to rise to 30 percent by 1981 compared to less than 17
percent in 1972. The manufacturing sector which is expected to provide the
bulk of the increment of exports is expected to contribute 40 percent of
the increment of total output between 1972-1981 (compared to less than 25
percent during 1962-72) and will also absorb 40 percent of the total fixed
investment (compared to about 20 percent in the past).
9.        There are, however, two notable differences from the past pattern.
The strategy aims at major shifts both in the structure of manufacturing
output and exports. Major expansion of shipbuilding, steel, petrochemical
and electronic industries is planned and the exports of these products
(amounting to less than $250 million in 1972 of which more than half was
in electronics) are expected to rise to about $5 billion by 1981. In
addition, substantial expansion in exports of industrial machinery, motor
cars as well as of the presently dominant exports, such as textiles, ply-
wood and footwear, is also planned. The other major difference in the
strategy compared to the past, is the aim to reduce sharply the denendence
on net inflows from abroad. This is in sharp contrast to recent trends;
during 1968-72 foreign savings financed over 40 percent of total investment.
10.       The Economic Mission's tentative view is that the general thrust
of Korea's development strategy is correct. The overall export expansion
which is planned does not appear unrealistic, given past performance,
current competitiveness and Jananese business' interest in shifting some



-4-
LnduXstries abroad. In ge-neral, the shift to heavy and chemical industries
aiso appears co be justified though the priorities within the proaram need
zo be defined more sharoly., The developments during the current year also
suggest that the potential expansion of light industry exports may have
',enf unLerescimated.
11.       Tahe Fconomic Mission was in the field before the recent develop-
ments affecting oil supplies took place. The availability of oil and the
prices at which Korea carn obtain it during the next few years will obviously
have crucial imnlications for the prospects of achieving the growth targets
mentioned in paragraph 8 above; however, the Mission has not, as yet, been
able to form a judgrment on the likely effects of oil shortages, and higher
oil prices, on the Korean economy over the next few years. It should be
noted, nowever, that Korea's dependence on imported fuels is extremely heavy
and that less than 10 percent of its energy requirements are met from domestic
sources. Korea will have to spend considerably more than in the past for
the oil it requires leading almost certainly to a substantial deterioration
in the terms of trade. Korea will also inevitably be affected by any
slowdown of the economic activity experienced by its two largest trading
partners, Japan and the USA, as a result of the uncertain world fuel supply
situation.
12.       The external capital requirements of the long-term program
(1973-81) appear to have been greatly underestimated by the Government.
Even on the assumption that the marginal savings rate will improve sharply
during the seventies compared with the sixties, Korea cannot hope to close
the resource gap by 1981 while pursuing high rates of growth of GNP.    The
external resource requirements would be particularly heavy for the period
1974-1978.  The gross borrowing reauirements during this period might turn
out to be in the neighborhood of S1.5 billion annually compared with the
earlier estimates of $900 million. But even with higher requirements and
higher external borrow-ing, the debt service ratio which is likely to come
down to 12-13 percent during 1973 is not Likely to exceed 15 percent in the
remaining period of the seventies, provided exports rise as expected.
13.       In conclusion, the magnitude and strategy of Korea's development
program for the 1973-81 period is regarded as being appropriate and worthy
of support from the Bank Group and other official lenders.    The success of
the Government's development efforts will depend to a great extent on its
being able to borrow larger amounts than it has in recent years from
abroad in order to finance the investment program which has been sizably
increased since the 1972-7n' Third Development Plan was formulated. The
Government is intensifying its efforts to prepare projects suitable for
external official finance especially in the fields of infrastructure, agri-
culture and regional development.   The foreign exchange component of such
projects is low. This is partly due to the fact that many projects of this
kind involve large expenditures on civil works which have a large
proportion of local costs, especially as Korea's construction industry
wins an overwhelming proportion of the contracts since it is efficient and
well organized; moreover the construction industry's dependence on imports
is expected to lessen in the future.   The country's external resource



- 5 -
requirements are therefore unlikely to be met if official lenders confine
themselves to financing only the foreign exchange costs of high-priority
projects. It is for this reason that the Bank should generally be prepared
to cover up to 50 percent of the total cost of the projects it finances
whenever the foreign exchange component is less than this amount.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN KOREA
14.       As of November 30, 1973, Korea had received 12 Bank loans and
8 IDA credits, amounting in total to US$417.5 million in loans and US$107.0
million in credits (taking into account cancellations and the refinancing of
one IDA credit in a subsequent Bank loan).
15.       About one-half of the total has been for the transport sector
- US$119.7 million for railways, US$54.5 million for highways and US$80 mil-
lion for ports. US$117.5 million has gone to agricultural projects - US$93
million for irrigation projects, US$7 million for livestock development,
US$10.5 million for the provision of medium - and long-term credit through
the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation and US$7 million for seeds
production. The Korean Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) has received
US$95 million in Bank loans for relending to private industry. The balance
of US$57.8 million was for two education projects.
16.       IFC has made four investments in Korea and its commitments amount
to US$3.4 million in loans and shares. 1/ IFC made its first equity invest-
ment in KDFC, of US$0.7 million or 14 percent of KDFC's paid-in capital,
at the time the Bank made its first loan to KDFC. A loan of USS1.4 million
to, and an equity investment of US$0.3 million in, the Homan Silk Co. was
made in 1969. In 1971, IFC purchased US$0.6 million of the shares of the
Korea Investment and Finance Corporation - a new institution whose function
is to assist in the development of the capital and money markets. The
Executive Directors approved on July 24, 1973 the exercise of preemptive
rights to purchase at par about US$355,000 equivalent of KDFC's common stock.
Prospects for further IFC investments in Korea are good.
17.       Of total Bank and IDA lending, about US$338 million remained un-
disbursed as at November 30, 1973. This is mainly due to the fact that
withdrawals have not yet commenced under several large loans made within the
past year.
18.       Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Loans, IDA credits,
and IFC investments as at November 30, 1973 and notes on the execution of
11   A fifth investment in the Atlas Paper Co. amounting to US$5 million
was cancelled at the request of the Company.

o.agoing projects. As inclicated in the notes, progress on project imple-
mencation is generally satisfactory, although difficulties have been
encountered with some projects and most seriously with the Pyongtaek-
Kungang irrigation Project (Loan 600-KG).
19.       The Bank's program for FY 1974 tentatively includes five projects.
Of these, a loan to help finance the expansion of seed production was
approved in October and a loan for tourism development earlier this month.
An integrated agricultural products processing project and a secondary cities
development project have jusz been appraised.   These projects are in accord
with a major objective of the current Third Plan viz, the narrowing of the
income gap between the urban sector and the rural sector through increased
agricultural investments and of developing the smaller cities to prevent
greater ecoriomic concentration in the major cities.  The proposed agricul-
tural products processing project will aim at increasing on-farm and processed
production of agricultural commodities throuigh the provision oL credit to
farmers, packers and processors. The proposed secondary cities project will
assist in the development of the Gwangju area, which is a poor, agricultural
region in the southwest of the country.   Baik assistance for the development
of this area has so far focused on agriculture through the Yong San Gang
river basin project (Loan 795/Credit 283-KG) and on transport development
through completion of sections of the Jeonju-Busan national highway linking
Gwangju and Suncheon wTith the national primary highway system.  The secondary
cities project will assist in the implemeentation of the next stage of the
Government's regional strategy involving investments -in industrial estates,
urban infrastructure, housing and recreational facilities with a view to
developing regional alternatives to the already overcrowded major cities of
Seoul and Busan.  The project now under consideration will also help regional
development bv irworoving communications between several relatively isolated
areas and large urban centers.
20.       The emphasis on ag-ciculiural and rural. development wille be
reflected in the operations program for the succeeding years FY1975 and
FY1976. The report of the agriculture sector vmission, which has recentlv
been discussed with che Government, should providc the basis for developing
additional hlgh priority agricultura'l projects. A second livestock project,
an agriculture credit project, a forestry project and the second stage
of the Yong San Gang Irrigation Project have already been identified.
21.       The other malor em,phasis In Korea's Third Plan, which is
supported by the Bank's economic analysis, is the transition from light to
heavy industrial development. The Banak's lending to industry in Korea has
been through the KDFC; the possibility of Bank lending to another financial
intermediary, the Korean 3evelopment Bank. (KDB), is under active consider-
ation.
22.       The development of the industrial and agricultural sectors will
require concurrenc infrastructure development. Although the transport
sector will be given less emphasis than irn the past, the investments
required are large and thus there is considerable support for this sector
in the program.



23.             The share of the Bank Group in Korea's total external debt
(disbursed) oustanding at the end of 1971 was 3.8 percent, and the share
in the debt service was 0.6 percent in the same period. If the Bank
Group's average annual rate of the lending of the past three years continues
(US$115-120 million), its share in the total amount of external debt out-
standing will increase to about 11 percent by 1978 and its share of debt
service to around 7 percent.
24.             The Consultative Group continues to be active.   Bilateral assis-
tance to Korea increased from $71 million in 1966 to $281 million in 1971,
with the U.S. and Japan being the principal donors providing some 97 percent
of the total bilateral assistance of $898 million during the 1966-71 period.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
25.       The development of the transport sector in Korea is seen most
clearly when viewed in the context of the remarkable growth and structural
change experienced by the economy during recent years. Manufacturing output
grew at an annual average rate of 17 percent in the 1960-71 period. The
pronortion of manufactured goods exported to total exports rose from about
13 percent to over 70 percent between 1960 and 1971.    This rapid expansion
of production and exports placed a a severe strain on the transport sector,
mainly becatuse relatively modest amounts were invested in the enlargement
of its capacity during the First Development Plan Period (1962-1966).
26.       During the Second Plan (1967-71) period, the demand for transport
facilities has increased at an even faster pace than many of the indicators
of economic growth, of which it is a function. Domestic passenger traffic,
in terms of passenger kilometers, increased at the annual average rate of
11 percent and freight traffic, in ton-kilometers, at 19 percent; interna-
tional traffic handled through the ports rose by 22 percent a year. The
Government realized that the further growth of the dynamic private sector
could be seriously impeded by the growing bottlenecks in transport infra-
structure. Accordingly, the allocation for investment in transport was
raised from 17 percent of the Government's canital expenditure in the
First Plan period to 27 percent for the Second Plan. During this period,
over 240 billion Won were committed for the improvement of the railways,
the construction of new and maintenance of existing roads and the expansion
of port and airport capacity. During the Third Plan (1972-76), the Govern-
ment intends to invest about 490 billion Won (US$1.25 billion equivalent)
in transport infrastructure; this amount will approximate to about 26 per-
cent of total Governmental capital expenditure during the Plan period.
27.       The Bank Group's association with the Government's efforts to
modernize and expand the transport sector in Korea dates back to 1962 when
a $14.0 million credit was made to help finance the first railway project.
The railroad system, which had been rehabilitated following the Korean War,
was at that time the only means for the large-scale movement of goods and



- 8 -
passengers since the country had a very small network of paved roads and
Few motor vehicles. The rapid economic progress of the succeeding years
indicated the need for a wider range of transport services. In 1965, the
Bank made a technical assistance grant for a comprehensive survey of land
transportation modes, which was carried out by consultants. Their report,
which was completed in late 1966, contained three major conclusions:
(a) that on account of locational factors, the railways could be expected
to handle most of the country's freight traffic, of which a large proportion
consisted of moving bulk commodities (such as coal, ore, oil, fertilizer
and cement) over relatively long distances; (b) that the lack of adequate
roads needed urgent attention, and that Government should emphasize highway
improvement in its development programs; and (c) that an organization to
coordinate transport policy was needed in order to ensure that investment
proposals were scrutinized with a view to minimizing the possibility of mis-
allocation of resources among the various modes and to develop regulations and
pricing measures to maximize the economic benefits from the large-scale
expenditures, which the Government intended to make for the improvement
and expansion of transport facilities. In 1968, the Association extended
a US$3.5 million technical assistance Credit (Cr. S-4-KO) to help finance
feasibility and detailed engineering studies to improve the highway network
and a study on transport coordination. A UNDP-financed port development
study was initiated in 1971 with the Bank acting as the Executing Agency.
The UNDP study recommended an investment plan for Korea's 17 first-class
ports.
28.       The Bank Group's lending operations have been directed towards
assisting the program of investments, which stemmed from a review of the
recommendations of the various studies referred to in the previous para-
graph. The Korean National Railways (KNR) has continued to receive Bank
Group support to improve and expand its services. To date, KNR has
received nearly $120 million in the form of loans and credits to help
finance four projects. In June 1973, the Bank made an $80 million loan
to support the expansion of two ports -- Busan and Mukho. Following the
studies financed from the proceeds of the technical assistance Credit
(S-4-KO, mentioned in paragraph 27), a Bank loan (769-KO) of US$54.5 million
was made in 1971 to finance the construction of about 400 kilometers of
national highways, feasibility and detailed engineering studies (covering
900 additional kilometers of priority roads), a highway maintenance study
and the purchase of equipment and spare parts for a pilot highway main-
tenance program. The construction program undertaken as part of the Project
is on schedule, the feasibility and detailed engineering studies resulted
in the identification and preparation of the road construction and paving
components of the project now under consideration; the highway maintenance
study and the experience gained under the pilot program provided the basis
for expanding the maintenance organization to cover the entire country under
the proposed project.
29.       The Government has made efforts to improve transport coordination,
as recommended by the consultants who carried out the 1965 land transportation
survey. A more detailed study of transport coordination needs was made by
consultants retained under the 1968 technical assistance Credit referred to



-9-
in paragraph 27. Following extensive discussions between the various
Government agencies involved and the Bank, a Transportation Planning Office
(TPO) was set up under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation (MOT)
in 1970. Its main functions are to collect data, assist in the assessment of
major investment proposals and make technical and economic recommendations in
the field of long-term transport planning. TPO is controlled by, and reports
to, a Transport Coordination Ministers Conference (TCMC) consisting of the
eight cabinet members whose ministries are most concerned with transport
matters. TPO's work is supervised by a Transport Coordination Working Group
(TCWG -- a Civil Service Committee on which the same ministries are represented).
TPO encountered a series of teething troubles, especially insofar as the
recruitment of adequately qualified staff was concerned. The Government is,
reviewing TPO's work program for the next three years with a view to taking
measures to make it more effective. TPO's future role was discussed further
during negotiations for the proposed project in the light of the findings
of recent supervision missions and the Government's plans for strengthening
it. It was agreed that the Government would submit a status report on
TPO's performance and staffing within three months of the approval of the
proposed loan with a view to discussing with the Bank, by mid-1974, TPO's
work program and the implementation of measures to enable it to accomplish
the tasks assigned to it.
30.       The development of the various transport modes in Korea has been
influenced by the nature of the terrain (about two-thirds of the land
surface is hilly); the concentration of economic activity and population
around the Seoul-Incheon and Busan areas; the location of domestic natural
resources, e.g. coal, iron ore and limestone, in the north, northeast and
center of the country; a long coastline with increasing industrial activity;
and the economic dependence on exports of manufactured goods and imports
of bulk raw materials.
31.       Railways.    The Government's Korean National Railways (KNR) has
3,085 route-km, all standard gauge, of which 528 km are double track.
Electrification of 350 km of industrial lines (carrying chiefly mineral
traffic) is scheduled for completion in 1974. Also in progress and scheduled
for completion in 1974 are the electrification of a further 108 km of suburban
lines and the construction of a subway, for mass transit in the Seoul area.
Of the rail freight traffic, over 80 percent consits of bulk commodities:
40 percent coal, 17 percent cement, 10 percent petroleum products, 6 percent
ore, 6 percent grain and 5 percent fertilizer. The railway is expected to
retain, or increase, its share of this traffic in line with its increased
capacity resulting from electrification and improvements in rolling stock.
The railway is also expected to retain a significant percentage of general
freight and passenger traffic.
32.       Ports and Shipping.   Freight traffic through the ports has
increased from about 7.5 million tons in 1962 to 51 million tons in 1971.
This sharp increase has occurred both in foreign trade and coastal shipping.
To meet the resulting port capacity problems, the port facilities are being
expanded, chiefly at Busan, Incheon, and Mukho, with the help of loans from



10 -
the Asian Development Ban'k and the Bank.  In addition, a new port is being
constructed at Pohang for the steel mill. The share of Korean vessels
has averaged only 20-25 percent of the total tonnage of its foreign trade,
slightly decreasing in recent years; attempts are being made to increase
this percentage through such measures as the building of shipyards and
the provision of finance to shipping companies. The expansion in coastal
shipping is largely due to the development of industry at Pohang, Ulsan,
Mfasan and other coastal sites.
33.       Aviation.   Domestic passenger traffic carried by air is growing
rapidly, but still amounts to only about one percent of the total. Domestic
air freight traffic is negligible. Internal routes are served by the
privately-owned Korean Airlines, which also provides an international
service. There are two international airports: Seoul, which is presently
being expanded, and Busan.
34.       Highways.   The road network in Korea consists of about 8,800 kms.
of national highways, approximately 10,800 kms. of provincial highways and
roughly 21,000 kIms of city and country roads. The major road arteries are
shown on the attached map.   Only about 3,000 kms of the nationally admin-
istered highways and about 2,800 kims of other roads are paved representing
some 15 percent of the total network. The greater part of the highway
system, which, in 1971, carried 70 percent of the country's passenger
traffic (in terms of passenger km) and about 20 percent of its freight
(measured in ton km) is in poor condition with roads being badly aligned,
narrow and poorly drained. This reflects the under-investment in road facilities
in the past. Until 1967, the amounts allocated to the highwav system were
grossly inadequate even for maintenance needs. In the period 1968-70, the
bulk of the funds invested in the highways network was used to finance the
contruction of two toll expressways (Seoul-Busan, 428 kms, and Seoul-Incheon,
30 kms). This resulted in a shortage of funds for the improvement of road
communications between many other areas of high economic activity.
35.       The rapidly risincg demand for road transport resulting from the
quickening pace of economic development in Korea urgently requires the
extensive improvement and expansion of the highway network. During the
1967-71 period the highways absorbed nearly all the increase in passenger
traffic, which has grown at an average annual rate of 18 percent. During
the same period, highway freight traffic has increased at an annual average
rate of 49 percent -- well over twice the rate for freight carried by all
modes (19 percent). Projections of the increase in road traffic made by
the Government and the Bank for the Third Plan period (1972-76) indicate
that the highwavs will continue to absorb all the increase in inter-city
passenger traffic and that the growth of freight traffic on them will
continue to rise but at a slower pace than witnessed during the last few years.
36.       The Government, in response to the present and anticipated needs
for improving the highway system, has allocated about 227 billion W4on
(S568 million equivalent) for highway construction and maintenance, for



- 11 -
the 1972-76 plan period, (this is only slightly less than the total allo-
cation for all transport modes, 240 billion Won, during the 1967-71 Plan
period). Some 165 billion Won ($412 million equivalent) is to be spent on
national highways for: (a) the construction of 1,000 kms. of new highways
and (b) the paving/betterment of 4,000 kms. of roads along existing align-
ments. The remaining 62 billion Won ($156 million equivalent) is to be
expended on paving about 3,500 kms of local and provincial roads. The
concept of paving and making minor improvements to existing road alignments
as a considerably cheaper alternative to undertaking new construction of
roads to higher standards has been a subject of discussion between the
Government, its consultants and the Bank over the last few years. The Bank
concurs with the Government's decision to undertake a relatively large
paving program and opting for construction of new road lengths only in cases
where traffic levels and the anticipated benefits justify it.
37.       The Government has become increasingly aware during recent years
of the necessity to improve the maintenance of highways. Financial allo-
cations for maintenance were extremely low in relation to needs, the main-
tenance agencies had inadequate staff and equipment and most roads, with
the exception of expressways, were in a state of disrepair. Accordingly,
funds were provided from the proceeds of the loan financing the First
Highway Project (769-KO) to set up a pilot maintenance unit to cover one
province around Seoul and for a Highway Maintenance Study to be undertaken
by consultants. The pilot maintenance organization began operations in
September 1972. Its performance during the last few months has been
encouraging. The consultant study has also been completed and its findings
and recommendations reviewed by the Bank and the Government. These include
proposals, which the Government has accepted and with which the Bank concurs,
to expand the maintenance organization to cover the remaining eight provinces
thus enabling it to serve the entire national highway network. Agreement
was reached during negotiations,that the maintenance organization would be
fully functional by January 1, 1976. In the interim, the Korea Highway
Corporation which has efficiently maintained the Seoul-Busan and Seoul-
Incheon Expressways, will have the responsibility for the maintenance of roads
constructed as part of the Bank-financed First Highway Project and other
important national highways.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
38.       The proposed project forms part of the Government's 1972-76
road construction and paving program (described in paragraph 36 above) and
includes the expansion of the road maintenance organization mentioned in
the previous paragraph. An appraisal mission visited Korea in March, 1973;
its report (No. 264a-KO) is being circulated separately. Negotiations were
held in Washington from November 26-30, 1973 with a Government team led by
Mr. J.S. Chung, Vice-Minister, Ministry of Construction. A Loan and Project
Summary is attached as Annex III. The proposed project consists of:



- 12 -
(a)  .. -       :.s1CL -  of natio.aal highways from Saemal to Gangreung
(97 kin) and Garngrecxig to Mukho (33 kira) in nortcheast Korea
(see map,) . Feasibility and detailed engineering studies of
the roads were made by consultants retained under the
Technical Assistance Credit (S-4-KO) and the First Highway
Project (769-KO).
(o)  the paying arid iaorovement or nine national highways totalling
about 634 kin, chiefly or. present alignments (see map). Four
of the roads to be paved were selected on the basis of
feasibility studies financed from the proceeds of the Loan
made for the First Highway Project.   The remainder were
chosen on the basis of a road-paving program developed by the
Government with the assistance of consultants also financed
from the proceeds of same Loan.
(c)  feasibility studies by consultants of about 1,000 km. of
national and provincial roads, to be followed by detailed
engineering if found justified; and
(d)  the procurement of highway maintenance equipment for the
extension of the national highway imaintenance organization
from a pilot province to the remainder of the country.
Cost Estimates
39.       The proposed loan of US$47 million would cover about half of the
estimated total project cost of US$94 million.. The foreign exchange com-
ponent of the project has been estimated at roughly US$39 million based on
the assumption, deemed most likely, that 80 percent of the civil works
contracts will be won by local construction firms; the proposed loan is,
therefore, expected to involve local cost finlancirng of about US$8 million.
However, since Korea has a competitive and well-organized construction
industry, it is conceivable that local firms might win all the construction
contracts; in that event, the foreign exchange component of the project would
be US$36 million and the Droposed loan would finance US$11.0 of local costs.
Detailed cost estimates are given in Annex III.
Execution
40.       As in the case of the First Highway Project, the Korean Ministry
of Construaction (MOC) will b2 responsible for the execution of the proposed
project through its 3ureau of Publitc Roads (BPR). Consultants will assist
in the supervision of the construction and paving of the highways included
in the project. Consultants will also help the BPR in carrying out feasibil-
ity and detailed engineering studies of the rouglhly 1,000 kmXs of roads some
of which will be selecred for construction and paving in the future.   The
enlargement of the roac mairtenance organization, which also falls under
the jurisdictiorn of the MOC, has been planned and will be implemented with
the helD of consultan-:s whose services are being financed from the proceeds
of the First highway Loan (709-KO).   The national highway maintenance



- 13 -
organization would consist of 19 field sections. Each field section will
have a depot, an office and a workshop and be provided with equipment
appropriate to maintain the roads for which it is responsible. The provision
and training of staff for this field organization is already being planned.
This will be accomplished partly by transfers from other departments of the
MOC and partly by recruitment. The staff of the maintenance organization
will be trained at the Ministry's training center and by attachment to the
maintenance field sections already in operation. A schedule for the
installation of the maintenance organization was discussed and agreed
upon during negotiations.
Procurement
41.       Contracts for highway construction and paving will be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding among pre-qualified firms,
in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Highway main-
tenance equipment will be procured after international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. A margin of preference will be
allowed to domestic bidders equal to the customs duty for the relevant item
or 15 percent, whichever is lower. The Government has given assurances
that no restrictions will be placed on the import of equipment required for
the project.
Disbursements
42.       Disbursements from the proceeds of the loan will be made on the
basis of:
(a)  45 percent of the total expenditure on construction and
paving;
(b) 100 percent of the foreign exchange expenditure on consulting
services;
(c)  100 percent of the c.i.f. cost of imported highway
maintenance equipment, or of the ex-factory price
of such locally manufactured equipment, or 75 percent
of the total cost of locally-purchased imported
eauipment (i.e. excluding local taxes). A schedule of
disbursements is included in Annex III.
Benefits and Economic Return
43.       The proposed project will assist the Government in improving and
modernizing a substantial portion of the national highway network (the roads
selected for construction and paving constitute nearly 9 percent of the
entire national road system). Further, it will help in the establishment
of an urgently needed maintenance system to prevent further neglect of
roads and protect the large investments already made and contemplated for
the highways sub-sector. The project will reduce the present high road
transport costs by lowering vehicle operating costs and by saving pas-
sengers' travel time and provide year-round access to, and within,



- 4 -
S.-';-lc1 rela.-ive`y Isolated areas.  By doing so it will help the Government's
regional aevelopment efforts.
The two roads chosen for construction (Saemal-Gangreung and
Gangreung-Niukho) are iocated in a relatively isolated part of northeastern
Korea. Both highway sections pass through difficult mountainous terrain
and Fhave Door alignmenits with steep gradients.  Travel speeds average 30 kIs
per hoar at imost even during dry weather.  The area which has important
resources sucn as fisheries, forestry, mirneral deposits and cement plants is
isolatad by ooor road conditions from the Seoul area.   It now takes over
eih,,t hours to travel by road from Seoul to Gangreung -- a distance of
about 230 kms. The construction of the two road sections will reduce this
travel time significanitiy a-nd stimulate economic activity in the north-
eastern coastal area.
45.       The road sections which have been selected for paving serve
largely regional interest by linking towns and villages to major arteries.
The roads are narrow, many sections are inadequately drained and main-
zenance is poor.  Their improvement will substantially assist the develop-
ment of the densely populated regions they serve and which at present
depend essentially upon agriculture. The improvement of communications in
these areas may also actract new industry.
46.       The urgent need to establish a road maintenance organization for
Korea has already been mentioned in this report. The setting up of the
national highway maintenance organization is expected to yield considerable
savings in vehicle operating costs.   Furthermore, it will reduce the invest-
ments which otherwise would have to be made to undertake major reconstruction
of roads which would fall into extreme disrepair.
47.       The economic rate of return for each of the two roads to be
constructed is estimated to be of the order of 25 percent. Insofar as
the paving program is concerned, the economic ana'ysis shows that the
estimated economic rate of return would fall in the range of 22-45 percent.
The economic rate of return on the maintenance element of the project
is expected to be substantial. Sensitivity tests assuming substantial
increases in constructior cost and a similar decrease in benefit have shown
that, even under the most pessimistic assumptions the rates of return for
the construction, paving and maintenance component of the project would still
remain acceptable.
PART V - LEG AL INSTRUMENTS AND AITHORITY
48.       The draft Loain Agreement betwee-n the Republic of Korea and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors



- 15 -
separately. The draft Loan Agreement follows the general pattern of
loan agreements relating to highway projects.
49.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI- RECOxISTNDATION
50.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

PROJECTS IN E.ECCUTION
1.        Loan No. 600        Pyongtaek-Kumang Irrigation Project;
US$45.0 million Loan of May 23, 1969
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This is the first major i-rrigation project constructed in Korea.
It was expected at appraisal that it would irrigate about 35,000 ha. of
land improve drainage and roads, consolidate all 2addy fields, bench
upland and reclaim tidal land.  The start of construction was postporned
by a major reorganization of the executing agency and delay in hiring
consultants; the project is now one year behind schedule. Detailed desig-ns
for the farm distribution system and land development disclosed that
certain areas included in the project are not suitable for gravity
irrigation. The net irrigable area now appears to be around 28,000 ha.
Project costs are expected to be higher than appraised, mairnly due to
higher unit prices. Re-examination of the economic analysis indicates
a reduction in the rate of return from 14 percent to 11 percent using revised
rice prices and around 7 percent if prices expected during appraisal are
used.  Disbursement is 58 percent behind even when a one-year postponement
is applied to the appraisal report schedule. Construction, however, is now
progressing satisfactorily, and all work is scheduled for completion by the
end of 1975. This will necessitate an extension of the Closing Date.
2.        Credit No. 151      First Education Project; US$14.8 million
Credit of June 4, 1969
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
This project comprises:  (a) the expansion and equipment of 27
technical high schools, 5 post secondary technical schools and 4 university
teacher training departments; and (b) 26 man-years of technical assistance,
20 man-years of overseas fellowships to support the development of agri-
cultural and/or technical education and to assist educational planning.
Project implementation is about 18 months behind schedule
because, in its initial stage, delays occured in the establishment of
the project unit, the selection and appointment of architects and the
formulation of equipment procurement procedures. The project is now
progressing satisfactorily, but it is expected that because of the initial
delays, it will be completed about one year later than estimated at
appraisal. This may require a postponement of the Closing Date by six
months to June 30, 1975.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

US$7.0 million Cred4t of February 11, 1971
Closing Date: March 31, 1977
Tne development of about 700 small and medium-size dairy farms
by providing long-tern loans and the construction and operation of two
dairy products processing plants are the principal conponents of the
project which also includes management and technical services related to
t'nese activities. Tne project is progressing satisfactorily. To date,
nearly 200 Korean farmers have participated. Following irnternati onal
competitive bidding, 1,$00 dair-y heifers have been purchased and a contract
for the supply of dai-ry processing equipment awarded; planning and
construction of civil works fJor the two dairy processing plants are well
underway; technical services are being strengthened; and applied research
for livestock production is bringing significant results.
5.        Loan No. 622 &       Second and Third KDFC Projects; US$20.0

The project includes the construction of approxi-nately 230 miles
of primary national highways becweeri Chonju and Busan; feasibility studies
of about 870 miles; and detailed engineering of an additional 680 miles.
A highway main-tenance study is aiso being undertaken and a national highway
maintenance organization establishea on a pilot basis _n one of the
provinces. Const-ruction is on schedule and within cost estimates.

7.        Loan No. 795        Yorig San  Gang Irrigation Project:
Credit No. 283      US$33.0 mIllioa Loan and US$15.0 million
Credit of February 2, 1972
Closing Date: September 30, 1977
This is the second major irrigation project financed by the
Bank in Korea. It aims at transforming an area with the highest drought
frequency in Korea into one with year-round irrigation and crop diver-
sification. Also there will be increased production of high-value crops.
The Loan/Credit became effective on September 15, 1972. Detailed
surveying and designing are proceeding satisfactorily and construction
has begun on three of the four dams. Cost estimates have increased by
about 19 percent mainly because of right-of-way costs, more dam foundation
grouting than expected at appraisal, and major changes in designs. About
1,400 ha. of additional land have been added to the project through revision
of original canal lines, thereby providing benefits which offset the in-
creased costs. Insufficient funds were budgeted originally for 1973, but
the Government after Bank urging has provided adequate Won financing for
the year so that construction can proceed on schedule. The need for
adequate funds in future years has been discussed with the Government.
8.        Credit No. 335       Agricultural Credit Project; US$10.5 million
Credit of September 29, 1972
Closing Date: September 1, 1976
This credit supports a three-year lending program for the devel-
opment of orchards, sericulture and to encourage poultry and swine production.
A supervision mission visited Korea in July 1973 and reported that although
the demand for agricultural credit was strong, the project was not being
implemented as planned due to the poor selection of Kun Cooperatives and
the lack of training and technical services. Loans to farmers were
suspended pending an improvement in the situation.    A November   super-
vision mission found that technical services and appraisals had become
somewhat better; the Bank therefore agreed to the resumption of lending
up to a limit of US$1.3 million equivalent, which will probably be
accomplished by the end of this year..- The project will be further reviewed
by a supervision mission in early 1974.
9.        Loan No. 863         Fourth Railway Project; US$40.0 million
Loan of November 22, 1972
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The main elements of the project are: electrification of lines
in the Seoul suburban area; purchase of electric railcars and locomotives;
the completion of electrification of 350 kms of line running from Seoul
to the northeastern part of Korea; track and bridge renewal; provision
of yard facilities; acquisition of passenger and freight cars; and improve-
ment of facilities for the maintenance and repair of motive power and

1/ Small amount for local handling, assembly and transport of imported
equipment; also possibly a small amount for local manufacture/assembly,
if domestiic suppliers submit successful bids for part of the equipment.
The total local cost is unlikely to exceed about 15% of the foreign
cost of equipment and will probably be under 10%.
2/ 10% on all items.
/ 12% on local and 10% on foreign cost of construction and paving.
