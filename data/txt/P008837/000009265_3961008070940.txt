THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION
STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:               The Russian Federation
Beneficiary:            State Committee for Standards (GOST)
Amount:                 US$24 million equivalent
Terms:                  Seventeen years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate.
Project Objectives:     The project has three objectives: (i) to support Russia's accession to the
WTO by helping it meet WTO requirements in the area of product and
process standards; (ii) to harmonize Russian standards (particularly for export
products) with international standards; and (iii) to upgrade and strengthen
Russian testing/certification capacity and institute mechanisms to facilitate
international accreditation (recognition) of Russian testing and certification
bodies, so as to increase the ability of Russian firms to receive pre-shipment
certification of their exports.
Project Description:    The project focuses on the following core activities:
(i)  The Standards Enquiry Point. GOST will create an enquiry point for
standards required by WTO, within the Russian Data Center (RDC).
Existing institutional infrastructure would be strengthened via the
upgrading and modernization of standards-related electronic data
processing and information management systems. Russian metrology
and testing centers would be networked into the RDC, enabling
users/exporters to access information on international standards. At
the international level, the RDC would interface with foreign WTO
enquiry points to remain current with foreign standards developments.
Foreign exporters to Russia would also be able to receive information
on Russian standards.
(ii)  Harmonization. To ensure that national standards are compatible with
(and ideally, identical to) international standards, the project would
support a case-by-case inspection of existing Russian standards, a
determination of whether there are any compelling reasons why the
international norm should not apply, and a redrafting, if necessary, of
the Russian standard.
(iii) Certification and Accreditation. To increase the ability of Russian
firms to receive pre-shipment certification by laboratories that have
been recognized by Russia's trading partners as conforming to
international standards, the project would enable certain Russian testing



- jj -
and certification bodies to conform with internationally accepted
norms, thus facilitating the negotiation of mutual recognition
agreements.
Rationale for
Bank Involvement:       In order for Russia to achieve a sustainable level of growth, there must be
a significant increase in exports of manufactured goods. Doing so requires
further integrating Russia into the world economy. Bank assistance would
contribute to this process by strengthening the institutional structure relating
to standards, thereby promoting the development of a strong, competitive and
export oriented manufacturing sector.
Benefits:               The project's immediate outputs would be to facilitate Russia's accession to
the WTO. Joining the WTO would make it more difficult for the imposition
on Russian exporters of quotas, discriminatory tariffs, and arbitrary
antidumping or countervailing duty actions, and guarantee nondiscriminatory
treatment and access to the WTO's dispute settlement rules. Over the longer
term, the main benefit would be the development of an export-oriented
manufacturing sector.
Risks:                  The project is subject to the risk that the conditions for accession to the WTO
will not be completed and the expected evolution of standards harmonization
and integration thus compromised. However, the authorities have given
priority to WTO accession.  The other important risks are inadequate
coordination of interdependent elements and slow or inefficient utilization of
funds due to unfamiliarity with Bank procedures concerning procurement and
disbursement. The grant-financed project preparation and implementation
consultancy services would help to reduce these risks.



THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION
STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
TECHNICAL ANNEX
I. INTRODUCTION
1.           There will be substantial gains for the international community by having a country of
Russia's size and economic potential participate actively in world trade. Russia is in the process of
acceding to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Russia became an observer to the WTO in 1990,
requested accession in June 1993, and presented the WTO Secretariat with a memorandum describing its
trade policies in February 1994. WTO membership will bring many benefits to Russia; it will guarantee
exporters nondiscriminatory treatment and access to the WTO's dispute settlement rules, and it will also
help the Government resist pressures for protection by making it more costly to pursue certain types of
restrictive trade policies, including in the area of standards and certification.
2.           Rapid accession to the WTO will help Russia maintain an outward looking trade stance.
WTO requirements and disciplines have implications for virtually all trade policies and implementing
agencies in Russia. Major policy areas where WTO scrutiny will occur include: (i) the extent of
centralized trade and the degree of state ownership of and intervention in the economy; (ii) the laws and
institutions governing trade, including licensing requirements and product standards; (iii) the level of
import duties and excise taxes; (iv) the administration of the customs regime and customs fonnalities; and
(v) access to service markets and the protection of intellectual property rights. The government has made
significant progress in adopting a trade policy stance that is consistent with WTO rules.' The proposed
project would also assist the Government in its efforts to accelerate accession to the WTO by helping it
satisfy WTO requirements in the area of product standards. Less progress has been made in standards-
related policies than in other areas. Implementing WTO-consistent procedures will facilitate a reduction
in the reputational problems that currently afflict Russian manufacturers.
3.           A striking characteristic of the composition of Russia's exports is that manufactured
products play only a minor role, particularly given the size of the industrial base. Many factors play a
role in explaining why manufactured exports are so low. Foremost among these are that Russian firms
have not had much, if any, experience in selling directly to foreign markets and product quality is low.
Under central planning, marketing was the responsibility of state foreign trade organizations or
alternatively, marketing was not necessary under governmentally negotiated trade agreements. Further,
Russian firms tend to be perceived as risky suppliers, either in terms of delivering on time or in terms
of delivering to specifications. Efforts to stimulate production for export must include the improvement
of the quality of Russian output--both in terms of the goods produced and the production processes used.
Existing "reputational" problems can be offset in various ways, but will clearly be a long-term process.
New technologies--both hard (equipment) and soft (management, marketing)--must be adopted.

II. INSTITUTIONAL SETTING
4.            GOSSTANDART  (GOST), the State Committee of the Russian Federation for
Standardization, Metrology and Certification is the main counterpart for the project. GOST's main
functions are outlined in Appendix I and are, briefly to: (i) be responsible for all matters relating to
WTO obligations in the standards area; (ii) provide metrology services, accredit and certify testing bodies
and act as a coordinator/registrar of standards; and (iii) write certain mandatory standards in the sphere
of social safety and consumer protection.2 GOST is best regarded as an "apex" institution; the primary
body responsible for developing and disseminating mandatory standards in Russia. Other entities beneath
the apex contributing to the development of specialized mandatory standards include Ministries, industry
associations, and special committees. A large number of testing and certification laboratories fall under
the GOST apex as well; however, many are fast becoming privatized and GOST expects to maintain only
a limited number of such bodies. Although much has been achieved towards converting GOST into a
standards body of the type found in OECD countries, much remains to be done to improve the standards-
related institutions. The institutional infrastructure has experienced real and severe cutbacks that have
slowed down the process of reorientation and modernization.
III. PROJECT RATIONALE
5.            As noted in the Country Assistance Strategy, institutional and legal reforms have been
given high priority by the Government and the Bank has encouraged the Government to target the use
of Bank funds for technical assistance to areas directly related to ongoing Bank policy and/or lending
activities. The CAS states that the Standards Development Project would improve standards certification
in connection with Russia's entry into the WTO, which complement trade policy reforms supported under
the Second Rehabilitation Loan as well as respond to the Government's stated priority for Bank
assistance in the development of nontraditional exports.
6.            In order to achieve a sustainable level of growth, there must be a significant increase in
Russia's exports of manufactured goods. Through trade, enterprises gain access to high quality
intermediate inputs and capital goods, accelerating technology transfer, and thereby allowing the quality
upgrading that must occur for manufactured exports to expand. Export orientation and greater interaction
with foreign partners will help guide enterprise reform and spearhead restructuring move generally. The
proposed project would support the improvement of the institutional framework relating to the
development, use and knowledge of standards in Russia's export sector. This would facilitate Russia's
integration into existing international cooperative networks on product and quality standards, and Russia's
accession to the WTO.
2/     GOST is not responsible for all mandatory standards. Instead, several and various other competent agencies work in
parallel. There are numerous agencies that are competent in the writing of Standards, in Russia. These include the
Ministries of Health, Transport, Agriculture, Energy, Environment, Communications, Internal Affairs, and Railways.
Other standards setting organizations include State Committees and professional/organizational industry committees.

IV. LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE
7.            Recent OED studies and reviews conclude that technology oriented projects should
emphasize development of institutions for standards, testing, technological information and technological
extension.3 Bank projects involving upgrading of standards institutions have generally focused on
industrial technological development and promotion of indigenous research and development (R&D)
activities. A 1991 Technology Development Project for Turkey comes closest to the proposed project.
It aimed at improving the competitiveness of Turkish producers on export markets by encouraging the
progressive introduction of ISO 9000 quality certification. This is increasingly a necessary condition for
exporting to industrial economies.
8.            Standards play an important role in industrial development facilitating production for
export by ensuring compatibility and quality. Experience in many developing countries has demonstrated
the beneficial role of strong standards-related institutions. Outward oriented development strategies
involving the production of technologically complex goods and products subject to health or safety
standards in export markets require the availability of appropriate information sources and testing and
certification entities.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
9.            The project has three objectives:
(i)  support Russia's accession to the WTO by helping it to meet WTO requirements in the
area of product and process standards. This includes the establishment of an enquiry
point for standards (see Appendix II);
(ii)   harmonize Russian standards with international standards particularly for export products;
and
(iii)   upgrade and strengthen Russian testing/certification capacity and institute mechanisms to
facilitate international accreditation (recognition) of Russian testing and certification
bodies, so as to increase the ability of Russian firms to receive pre-shipment certification
of their exports.
B. Project Description
10.           The project focuses on core institution building activities that include the financing of
equipment and technical assistance.  The four components are:  (i) The Standards Enquiry Point;
(ii) Standards Harmonization; (iii) Certification and Accreditation; and (iv) a Project Preparation and
3/     Bank Lending for Industrial Technology Development. Report No. 12138, June 30, 1993.

Implementation Unit (PPIU). The project development indicators are outlined in Appendix III. As this
is an institution building TA project the benchmarks are largely qualitative in nature.
The Standards Enquiry Point (US$14.4 million of baseline costs)
11.           Consistent with WTO requirements, a standards enquiry point would be established within
GOST. More specifically, the Russian Data Center (RDC) within GOST's Institute for Marketing and
Research has been designated to be responsible for the enquiry point. The RDC would be responsible
for collecting all mandatory standards applied within Russia, and for their dissemination to foreign firms
and standards-setting bodies. The RDC would also function as a depository of foreign standards, and
provide information on such standards to domestic firms upon request. GOST intends the RDC to be in
communication with standards-setting Russian bodies as well as international ones.  In terms of
organization, the RDC is envisioned to be the hub of a telecommunications network linking standards
bodies, allowing it to help fulfill GOST's standards compliance and coordination responsibilities
(Appendix IV). The project is primarily financing computer systems, including a large network and
document database server system (incorporating document scanners, optical storage and extensive
document database management and communications software). Network access for local exporters will
require no more than a personal computer and modem to connect to the nearest regional system for access
to the entire network. Access to Russian standards information from abroad will be addressed by
interconnection with the international Internet network, using the facilities of the World Wide Web
(WWW) and readily available document browvser software.
Harmonization (US$6.4 million of baseline costs)
12.           Harmonization will involve a joint effort by Russian and foreign experts to conduct a
case-by-case inspection of existing standards, compare them with the equivalent international standard,
determine whether there are any compelling reasons why the international norm should not apply, and
if not, redrafting of the Russian standard.  The proposed loan would finance specific studies to:
(i) identify nonconforming standards; (ii) determine their continuing validity; (iii) assess the extent of
their divergence from international standards; (iv) evaluate, jointly with Russian bodies, the nature of any
constraints to modifications and assess whether there are any compelling technical reasons why they
should not be modified; and (v) rewrite, i.e., harmonize the Russian standards. Research would also be
conducted to identify areas where there are no standards in Russia, but international norms apply to
exported goods. In these cases, studies would be conducted to incorporate the international norm into
the body of Russian standards.
Certification and Accreditation (US$9.9 million of baseline costs)
13.           Russian exports will be facilitated if products and/or production processes can be tested
and certified in Russia before incurring shipping costs. A necessary condition for certification is that
Russian firms satisfy the health, safety and environmental standards that are applied in foreign markets.
This requires that Russian laboratories are able to certify that this is the case, and are recognized by their
counterparts and trading partners. Certification of production processes may be a necessary condition
for successfully obtaining export contracts. Obtaining certification on the basis of an international series
of quality standards, such as ISO 9000, will be particularly useful in terms of helping Russian enterprises
overcome a perceived "quality deficiency" problem in foreign markets. In part, certification and quality
control procedures can be obtained from bodies that are accredited and recognized by foreign customs
and standards bodies such as DIN (Germany), BSI (United Kingdom), or AFNOR (France), as there are



Techlnical Annex
Russia: Standards Development Project                                                       Page 5
no formal barriers to entry facing foreign specialized testing and certification bodies that seek to establish
laboratories in Russia. Indeed, recognizing the importance of intermediation by agencies, such as Societe
Generale de Surveillance (SGS) or Bureau Veritas, GOST is particularly interested in attracting foreign
firms to certify Russian products for export markets.
14.            International recognition requires that: (i) at the level of metrology, primary level
certification labs are up to par, and recognized to be so by international counterparts, and (ii) that at the
level of product testing, relevant testing bodies are accredited by recognized primary level certification
bodies. The project would enable Russian testing and certification bodies to conform with the norms that
have been established in international agencies, such as the International Standards Organization (ISO),
the International Electro-Technical Commission (IEC), and the UN Economic Commission for Europe
(ECE) for certification systems. Affected testing and metrology products include tractors, other transport
equipment, and electrical and electronic machinery. Once testing and metrology equipment has been
installed and Russian personnel of the various testing bodies have been trained, the project would support
their accreditation by representatives of the relevant international accreditation systems (IEC, OECD,
ECE, and Lloyd's). To a large extent, the negotiating of mutual recognition agreements is a confidence-
building exercise, involving the exchange of personnel and active participation in international and
regional certification bodies, supplemented by investment in the necessary testing equipment for
certification entities and metrology labs. As Russian accreditation bodies approach conformity with
international standards and gain accreditation under the relevant systems, the potential for achieving
comprehensive, mutually acceptable recognition agreements of testing laboratories would be significantly
enhanced.
15.           The project would finance equipment for testing centers including integrated gas
analyzers, smoke density indicators, sound and vibration measurement instruments, engine capacity test
beds and crash testing equipment. Also supported would be expenditures to finance an exchange program
of Russian and foreign experts to promote mutual exchange of information and recognition, overseas
training of test engineers and certification personnel in counterpart OECD environments, and study tours
at WTO enquiry points. Within Russia, the project would deliver important standards-related training,
using a "train the trainers" approach, to improve and up-date accreditation training in the accreditation
centers. It is proposed that research studies be conducted, employing Russian experts on accreditation
and certification, and that information on the latest product and manufacturing process standards be
disseminated to Russian exporters and foreign exporters to Russia.  Publicity efforts regarding
certification and accreditation supported by the project include the production of a periodical journal and
the establishment of a Federal Information center within GOST.
Project Preparation and Implementation Unit (PPIU) (US$1.3 million of baseline costs)
16.           The PPIU is responsible for project administration and implementation management for
GOST. The project's manager and finance officer are in place and will have responsibility for overall
project implementation.   PPIU  staff will include resident or contract experts in procurement,
disbursements, and accounting and auditing. Technical assistance oversight is being provided by a Project
Advisor who would be directly responsible for training a counterpart project manager along with other
project support staff. The PPIU will also employ translation and interpretation services to facilitate the
delivery of technical assistance. Technical assistance would be provided for a period of approximately
one year under a grant from the Government of Canada for the transfer of project management skills to
counterpart staff, including the development of proper project implementation procedures and the
maintenance of project accounts for external and Bank auditing purposes. The PPIU will commence

operation with the assistance of a Project Preparation Facility of the amount of US$400,000.
Appendix V provides a detailed description of the PPIU.
C. Technical Assistance and Training
17.           Training will be provided in each of the three areas targeted by the project. For the
enquiry point, staff of the RDC will be provided with training in operations and systems management in
other WTO enquiry points and by foreign experts in Russia (TA for institutional development). The
provider of computer and telecommunications equipment will be responsible for installation-related
support training. Russian personnel of the sites that will be linked to the RDC network will be trained
in Moscow in the use of the system. For harmonization, training will be provided to personnel involved
in standardization activities with a view to accelerate harmonization of Russian standards with
international norms. This will comprise a 'train the trainer' activity, the goal being to develop skills that
can be passed on to the staff of institutes and standards-writing bodies. Engineers of testing labs and
entities that will be provided testing and metrology equipment under the project will also be provided with
training, both in Russia and overseas, in certification, testing and accreditation procedures (TA for
institutional development), to make them current with international procedures. Technical assistance (TA)
to support the training of project management and implementation skills (project support TA) will be
provided by the Resident mission (for project accounts and disbursement operations) and by the
Government of Canada in the form of a project implementation specialist who will be available to assist
the director of the PPIU for the first year or so.

18.           The total project cost is estimated at about US$34 million equivalent, including
contingencies amounting to US$2.0 million which represents about 6 percent of base costs. Project costs
include the provision of technical assistance (both foreign and local) and training and study tours in WTO
member country enquiry points; training initiatives to standardize export certification, including an active
information dissemination program; measures to promote access to international information databases
to ensure compatibility with WTO standards; telecommunications and computer equipment, training
materials and software to create the RDC network to metrology centers and standard writing bodies; and
minor refurbishing and furnishing of facilities in the process of being updated during project
implementation. The estimated costs by component and by category of expenditure are shown below
(Tables 2 and 3), and are further detailed in Appendix VI.

Basis of Cost Estimates
19.    Project costs were estimated as follows:
(i)    Base Costs. All project costs are based on January 1995 prices converted to US dollars.
Technical assistance costs are derived from recent fees quoted for comparative specialized
services in Bank-financed projects in Russia and are estimated per person month at
US$20,000 for external specialist services, US$2,800 for local specialist services, and
US$6,000 for overseas study tours. The person month costs of TA include fees,
recruitment/relocation costs, housing and subsistence, and overheads. Equipment unit
costs are based on recent quotations from suppliers of equipment and software; staff unit
costs are based on current competitive rates for local staff in the private sector.
(ii)    Contingency allowances. Contingencies for domestic price increases are projected at
rates of 298 percent for 1995; 16.3 percent for 1996; and 3.8 percent for 1997.4
International inflation rates are included at 2.0 percent, 1.6 percent and 2.1 percent,
respectively, for 1995, 1996 and 1997.5 Physical contingency allowances are included
at 5 percent of equipment costs and 10 percent of costs for civil works and recurrent
operating costs. Price and physical contingencies account for 6 percent of project
baseline costs (US$2 million).
(iii)   Foreign Exchange Component.  The foreign exchange component was estimated as
follows: (i) expert services and overseas training - 100 percent; and (ii) equipment - 100
percent (less import duty) for equipment purchased on the international market and 80
percent (less domestic taxes) for equipment purchased locally. Total project costs are
US$33.8 million of which the foreign exchange component is US$24.0 million.
(iv)   Local Costs, Taxes and Duties. Project costs include a local cost component (including
taxes) of US$10 million equivalent, which is 29 percent of total project costs. Of this,
the Bank is financing US$0.7 million; GOST US$4 million. Bank local financing is for
"off the shelf" office equipment, and local marketing/publicity activities. Taxes amount
to 15 percent of total project costs and are estimated at US$5 million of total costs.
Taxes will be financed by the Government.
(v)    Recurrent Costs. GOST-financed operating costs are estimated at US$3.4 million of base
costs, and include cost elements that relate to facilities expenses at 3 locations - the RDC
in Moscow, 125 regional Metrology Centers and several Standards Institutes and
Ministries. The Bank will finance a small amount of incremental systems operating costs
during the implementation period (start up network and telecommunication charges).

VI. PROJECT FINANCING
20.           Loan. The proposed Bank loan of US$24 million would finance 71 percent of total
project costs. Of this, US$23.2 million would finance 97 percent of the foreign exchange requirements
of the project, and US$0.8 million would finance almost 18 percent of the local costs of the project. The
local cost component would support the purchase of off-the-shelf equipment (excluding taxes) and limited
civil works activities.
21.          Local/Borrower Contribution. The share of financing assumed by GOST would support
the local cost element involved in the employment of resources to implement relevant project components:
20 percent of the local cost of publicity and marketing of certification and accreditation activities; 20
percent of the cost of procuring off-the-shelf office equipment including furniture; 20 percent of the cost
of implementing civil works activities; and 100 percent of all recurrent costs. As illustrated in Table 4
below, the total local cost contribution by GOST would be the Ruble equivalent of US$4.2 million.

22.           Grant Financing. The Government of Canada is proposing a grant contribution of
US$800,000 equivalent to finance the costs associated with the transfer of technical assistance to manage
project implementation, and provide training related to standardization.

VII. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Management
23.          Project Management and Implementing Agency. The Government of the Russian
Federation, the Borrower, has designated GOST to be the project management and implementing agency.
GOST would be the focal point for liaison with the Bank, and would represent the borrower in this
capacity. GOST would bear primary responsibility for managing the oversight of the establishment and
functioning of a WTO-consistent enquiry point, including technical assistance requirements that would
be provided for the training of enquiry point personnel in standards and product specifications. Personnel
of testing/certification bodies would be trained in certification procedures during the course of expanding
the capability of certification centers in Russia. Users of the enquiry point, including units with network
access, would need to be incorporated into the system of information dissemination. The project would
support publicity, marketing and outreach facilitation activities toward this end.
24.          ProjectPreparationand Implementation Unit. Project administration and implementation
support is the responsibility of a Project Preparation and Implementation Unit (PPIU) which reports to
GOST. As agreed, the PPIU was established by GOST prior to loan negotiations (August 9). So far the
PPIU includes a Russian Project Director, foreign operations expert(s), and some Russian counterpart
staff. When fully staffed the PPIU will comprise a Project Director, a Finance Officer, a Training
Manager, administrative staff (including interpreters/translators). The PPIU will contract technical
assistance services such as procurement, auditing and information technology. The project would employ
foreign and local/specialists to train PPIU staff in project management skills, with the objective of making
them capable of oversight of ongoing project operations and implementation review. PPIU professional
and administrative staff would be trained to maintain records, oversee requests for disbursements and
liaise with the Bank during implementation. The PPIU would be financed in part by the loan and by
Government resources; a grant from the Canadian government will finance Canadian consulting services
designed to support the PPIU. The loan would finance project management expertise and specialists in
data systems management, training services and project implementation planning and scheduling. The
PPIU will commence operations with the assistance of a Project Preparation Facility of the amount of
US$400,000. The PPF would initiate limited implementation activities focussing primarily on preparatory
work and detailed design development.
25.           The PPIU, created to administer the project on behalf of GOST and the Government, will
be responsible for daily direction and coordination of project implementation and assisting the Data
Center, Certification units and other participants, with implementation requirements. The PPIU will have
the legal authority to enter into implementation contracts. It will also be responsible for administering
funding flows, monitoring progress under the components, and reporting to the Government, World Bank
and other donors, as appropriate, on management issues and overall implementation progress.
26.          The PPIU will operate at full capacity for about two years during project start up and
initial implementation, and will then be scaled back in phases to a smaller staff needed for oversight,
accounting and residual reporting for the remaining implementation period. PPIU staff would be trained
and/or assisted by specialists and consultants under contract (e.g., procurement, audit, ISO
systems/information technology). As major project elements are completed, PPIU functions will be
absorbed into relevant divisions of GOST, completing the project's parallel objectives of
institutionalization.

B. Project Implementation Arrangements
28.           The project would be implemented as a complement to ongoing GOST activities already
initiated to further Russia's efforts to upgrade its standards institutions. Upon the completion of
procurement, delivery and installation of equipment, the project would begin training activities, both
domestic and overseas, while simultaneously initiating the development of the RDC's network structure
and access capabilities. Other simultaneous and supporting implementation would focus on dissemination
and marketing of standards-related information to exporters and interested foreign parties. The RDC's
network would be set up initially on a pilot basis. Modifications would be incorporated and the system
made accessible to all users when fully operational. A summary of project implementation is in Table
5. Details are presented in Appendix VII.

VIII. PROCUREMENT
General
29.             Procurement will be the responsibility of the Project Preparation and Implementation Unit
in GOST, assisted by an experienced procurement services firm. All Bank-financed goods and consulting
services required for the Project will be procured, respectively, in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines
for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January, 1995), and Use of Consultants by World
Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing Agency (August, 1981). Procurement actions will be
carried out using the Bank's standard bidding and contracting documentation, as required by the Bank.
Prior Bank reviews of procurement procedures, terms of reference, invitations and bidding
documentation, evaluations and contracting actions will be effected where indicated by the Guidelines and
procurement thresholds discussed below. Procurement expertise will be provided to GOST from the
beginning of implementation activities by an approved Advisor and/or procurement services firm,
experienced in administering World Bank-financed purchases.  The Bank's standard bidding and
contracting documentation, as appropriate, will be used for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and
for engaging consultants and (minor) works services.   Bank-approved procedures will be used for
(minor) rehabilitation works -- to prepare computer facilities for the new equipment -- and test center
upgrades, as needed. Documentation developed by the Region will be used for these (minor) works
procurements. International Shopping (IS) and Local Shopping (LS) procurements will use commercial
documentation that will be adequate for later review and audit purposes. Additional details on expected
procurement actions and procurement plan are provided in Appendix VIII. A summary of procurement
categories and procurement methods is shown in Table 6.

Procurement of Goods
30.              Procurement of goods  will primarily  involve  computer  hardware  and  software;
teleconmmunications gear; databases; printing, reproduction and office equipment; and some minor
facilities renovations to accommodate the new systems. Wherever practicable, goods will be aggregated
to minimize procurement administration and reduce cost. Procurement actions are expected to be
undertaken within the following categories:

Russia: Standards Development Project                                              Page 15
ICB Procurement
31.          International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procurement procedures will be conducted in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, dated
Januarv, 1995.  ICB will be used for all purchases which are expected to exceed US$300,000 per
contract. This will cover the bulk of the Data Center and extended satellite systems computers and
operating software, telecommunications, and test center equipment. Of the total of approximately
US$20.2 million (US$15.4 million in loan funds) allocated for the purchase of necessary equipment (e.g.,
computer/information technology, testing instruments, printers and copiers, office equipment), US$18.8
million (US$14.1 million in loan funds) or about 92 percent will be procured using ICB procedures. In
the comparison of bids for equipment purchased under ICB, Russian manufacturers would be allowed
a preferential margin over the competing price of imports, as per Bank Guidelines. The project is
expected to have five ICB purchases, averaging approximately US$3.8 million per contract. The Bank
will review and clear ICB procedures, bidding documents, evaluations and resulting contracts on an ex-
ante basis; and otherwise review and provide "No-Objections", as provided for in the Guidelines.
Because computer equipment and software purchases are expected to involve improving technologies and
declining industry prices, some ICB purchases are expected to be spread over a period that is consistent
with expected regional and local offices' development and installation schedules.  Computer and
telecommunications equipment suppliers would have to demonstrate a capacity, at least by the time of
tendering, to successfully supply, install and maintain the equipment purchased. The Bank's newly
developed IT documentation and bidding procedures will be used for these latter procurements.
Direct Contracting
32.          Direct Contracting (DC), as outlined  in the Bank's Guidelines, is expected to be
employed in the procurement of proprietary database components to make the Russian Data Center
compatible with the WTO's international standards system. Proprietary database procurement is expected
to involve one contract and about US$610,000 in Loan funds. Spare parts for equipment and netware
elements may also be appropriate for DC purchases. As required by the Guidelines, Direct Contracting
actions will be justified and all documentation, awards and 'ontracting actions will be subject to prior
Bank review and clearance.
International Shopping
33.          International Shopping (IS) may be authorized for readily available, off-the-shelf
purchases under US$300,000 per contract. International Shopping will be based on quotations from at
least three suppliers, from at least two different Bank-member countries, as indicated in the Guidelines.
International Shopping is expected to total about US$540,000 (US$410,000 in Loan funds) and involve
three purchases averaging about US$180,000 each. Bank reviews of IS actions will be conducted on an
ex-post basis during supervision missions or procurement reviews.
National Competitive Bidding
34.          Because they would not be attractive to foreign suppliers, some (minor) ministry, institute
and test center computer room improvements that will be less than US$300,000 per contract will be
carried out using National Competitive Bidding (NCB), as provided for in the Bank's Guidelines. These
basic NCB procedures and procurement documentation would be submitted to the Bank for review and
approval prior to implementation.  The three expected NCB actions are expected to total about



Technical Annex
Russia: Standards Development Project                                            Page 16
US$446,000 and average about US$148,000 per purchase.   The Region's standard bidding
documentation, dated July, 1994 for works will be used for works procurements that are over
US$250,000. Works contracts under US$250,000 each will use the ECA Region NCB documentation,
dated June 1994. At the option of the Government, the procedures may include payments in local
currency, publications and documentation in the local language, and local procedures for settlement of
disputes.   There are expected to be five or six small-value, local area network installations,
refurbishment and utility improvement contracts (for the PPIU and some test centers) that would be
undertaken using Local Shopping procedures. These transactions would average about US$40,000 each
in loan funds. To avoid inefficiencies in the administration of these latter small-value works activities,
procurement would follow a simpler, more streamlined NCB procedure. These minor works contracts
would be based on lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded after comparison of at least three bids from
qualified contractors, a procurement option that was a feature of Local Shopping in the former
Guidelines. In any event, these procedures will include the Region's standard (minor) works
documentation dated June 1994 (for contracts under US$250,000). The first two works contracts and,
if any, works contracts over US$250,000 each would be subject to prior Bank review and approval. All
other works contracts would be subject to ex post review.
National Shopping
35.          To support regional and local office computer, telecommunications and database
installations, it is expected that GOST and the PPIU will need to initiate a few small value equipment
purchases using National Shopping (NS) techniques, as described in the Guidelines. NS purchases will
complement GOST-financed office upgrades and are expected to cover contracts under US$50,000 each.
These purchases will be used for small value transactions for simple works and readily available, off-the-
shelf items. National Shopping procedures will also be used for minor purchases of office supplies,
equipment services and consumables. NS procedures will be carried out by obtaining at least three price
quotations from different eligible suppliers.  Such purchases are expected to number about nine
transactions, averaging about US$32,000 each, and total about US$235,000. Small value purchases will
be subject ex-post documentation reviews, with payments probably being effected by Special Account and
Statement of Expenditure.
Technical Assistance
36.          A total of about US$9.0 million (US$8.5 million in loan funds) is allocated for the
procurement of technical and training services to assist GOST with project management and the planning,
development and administration of the standards improvement and dissemination program. GOST is
expected to need technical expertise for the development of: computer systems, harmonizing standards,
training testing and certification personnel, developing the standards enquiry point within the Russian
Data Center and organizing and implementing the project's oversight, procurement and audit functions.
There will also be a need for expatriate assistance in EDP work and developing policy and legislative
papers for national standards implementation.  Consultant services would be procured under contracts
awarded to firms or individuals whose qualifications, experience, and terms and conditions of employment
are satisfactory to the Bank. The participation of local consulting firms and personnel will be encouraged
to develop the domestic consulting industry. Bank-financed consulting services will be procured in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World
Bank as Executing Agency, published in August, 1981. The Bank's standard bidding and contract
documentation will be used. Solicitation methods and Terms of Reference for all consultant assignments,
and all procurement documentation and contracts with consulting firms valued at greater than US$100,000



Technical Annex
Russia: Standards Development Project                                            Page 17
will be subject to prior Bank review and approval. Prior Bank review and approval will also be required
for short lists and contracts with individuals that are expected to exceed US$50,000 each. There will be
about a dozen technical assistance and consulting contracts with firms, totaling approximately US$8.5
million (US$7.2 million in loan funds and averaging about US$675,000 each), that will be over
US$100,000 and subject to prior Bank review and approval. Contracts with individuals over US$50,000
are expected to be three in number, average about US$100,000 and total about US$300,000. The other
expected consulting contracts with firms (five each), averaging about US$65,000 each, and seven
contracts with individuals, averaging about US$23,000 each, (and together totaling about US$490,000)
will be subject to ex-post reviews on a selective basis during supervision missions and/or as part of
periodic procurement implementation reviews. Where practicable, technical assistance, such as database
development and/or standards harmonization services will be sought in consolidated packages to improve
accountability and reduce costs and administrative burdens.
Procurement Supervision
37.          In summary, ICB and DC purchases of computers, testing and telecommunications
equipment and software will be subject to prior Bank reviews and "No-Objections", as provided for in
the Guidelines. The first two works contracts under NCB and those over US$200,000 will also be subject
to prior review. Procurement of consulting services will be subject to prior Bank reviews for all TORs,
and for procedures, documentation and contracting with firms over US$100,000 and with individuals over
US$50,000. Procurements of goods and services will use the Bank's standard bidding and contracting
documents, modified or supplemented as necessary, with Bank prior approval. This procurement plan
will result in the Bank's prior reviews of approximately 92 percent of total Bank funds committed for
materials and equipment.  Besides reviewing TORs, Bank reviews of contracting actions for standards
development and harmonization and training services will cover an estimated 93 percent of total Bank
funding for technical assistance inputs. In addition, Bank staff will monitor procurement activities,
contract administration and project record keeping during supervision missions.
Docunentation Processing and Reporting
38.          An advisor and/or procurement services firm will be engaged by GOST during the PPIU
formulation phase to develop procurement plans, develop typical documentation packages and establish
procurement procedures. These specialists will help prepare documentation and, via consultations and site
visits, guide program participants in procurement planning, bid packages, solicitations, evaluations,
contracting and periodic procurement reporting requirements. These procurement specialists will also
help coordinate documentation flows needed to secure the World Bank's clearances and "No-Objections"
on consultants' TORs and equipment packages needing prior Bank review. With their help, GOST will
have records of and include information on project procurement activities in periodic reports to the Bank.
IX. DISBURSEMENTS, ACCOUNTS AND AUDITING
39.          The proceeds of the loan are expected to be fully disbursed over a 48 month period, with
most of the disbursement occurring between the fourth through the seventh semesters of the disbursement
period. The estimated disbursement schedule is shown in Table 7.

Documentation
40.            Disbursements would be fully documented except that Statements of Expenditure (SOEs)
will be used for: expenditures under contracts of goods valued at less than US$300,000; expenditures
under contracts of individual consultants valued at less than US$50,000 expenditures under contracts of
consultants' firms valued at less than US$100,000; and expenditures under contracts for civil works
valued at less than US$200,000. All pertinent documentation and records with regard to disbursement
would be retained by GOST for at least one year after project completion. In addition, documentation
should be kept until project completion to allow for recovery of the special account. Documentation
would be made available for review by the auditors and by Bank staff on request.
The Special Account
41.            To facilitate payments of small amounts and payment in local currency, the Government
would establish a Special Account denominated in US dollars in a commercial bank acceptable to the
IBRD. The selection process and qualifications of the chosen bank would be governed by specific
processes and criteria, described below. The maximum authorized allocation would be US$800,000.
The initial deposit into the account at project start will be US$100,000; this amount will be increased
after the first year of disbursement or when the Loan has reached US$1 million. All requests for
replenishment would be supported by documentation as described in para 6.31 of the Disbursement
Handbook. GOST, as implementing agency, would be responsible for reconciliation of project accounts
with disbursements and replenishment requests, and would forward these as supporting documents with
each application for replenishment.



Technical Annex
Russia: Standards Development Project                                               Page 20
42.           The commercial bank holding the Special Account would be chosen on the basis of open
competitive bidding, and would, as a pre condition, be required to meet the following eligibility criteria:
(i)   it should be financially sound as demonstrated by their latest accounts which would be
audited by an internationally recognized audit firm;
(ii)    have significant foreign correspondence banking in all major currencies;
(iii)   have some experience, or at least the capacity to acquire experience, in issuing letters of
credit, transacting direct foreign payments;
(iv)   provide a wide range of local banking services, including cash payments, domestic
transfers, issuance of debit notes, and capacity to maintain several accounts for the
Special Account;
(v)    be a member of SWIFT, or plan to use the facility to expedite payments;
(vi)   be willing and able to issue a Comfort Letter to assure that amounts deposited in the
Special Account would not be set off, seized or otherwise attached to satisfy amounts
due to the commercial bank by the Borrower;
(vii)  be willing and able to adequately maintain accounts as required by IBRD, including
regular statements, and any other information that may be considered necessary;
(viii)  charge competitive rates for services and other transactions fees.
Project Accounts and Audits
43.           The PPIU would maintain a single set of project accounts for GOST, including the Special
Account. These records would be audited in accordance with the "Guidelines for Financial Reporting
and Auditing of Projects and disbursements under SOEs, financed by the World Bank" (March 1982).
The Borrower would provide, within six months of the end of each Government fiscal year, an audit
report of such scope and detail as the IBRD may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by an
independent auditor acceptable to the IBRD, on disbursements against SOEs. The separate opinion should
mention whether SOEs submitted during the fiscal year, together with the procedures and controls
involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawal applications.
Bank Supervision
44.           The proposed project focuses on the strengthening of the institutional capacity of GOST
to create the enabling environment relating to standards in a market economy including harmonization
of Russia's standards. Regular Bank supervision with timely field visits is essential to achieve project
goals. However, GOST is not a new institution. It has traditionally been responsible for the development
of standards, and would not require extensive Bank supervision. A supervision schedule is contained in
Appendix IX. In terms of supervision the key outputs are noted below. A mid-term review will be held
early in 1997 to determine the status of Russia's accession to the WTO, the Government's trade policy,
and the standards-related policy environment confronting importers and exporters.

45.           Key supervision outputs.
Enquiry point
(1)    Creation of the organizational structure of the Russian Data Center (the enquiry point);
determination of its responsibilities; appointment of staff; securing of premises.
(2)    Installation of computer and telecommunications equipment.
(3)    Development of database structure and software.
(4)    Creation of standards databases.
(5)    Linking standards-writing, testing and certification entities to the network.
Harmonization
(1)    Identify the more important inconsistent standards, with an impact on international trade.
(2)    Adopt new standards on a case-by-case basis.
Certification
(1)    Installation of relevant testing and metrology equipment.
(2)    Identification of personnel to be sent for overseas training in certification.
(3)    Adopt certification mechanisms and procedures required under relevant international
protocols.
(4)    Request accreditation by relevant international certification bodies.
X. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY, BENEFITS AND RISKS
Sustainability
46.           The proposed project does not pose any unusual difficulties to be sustained over the long
term. The project will assist the Government to satisfy WTO requirements, and in the process, help to
integrate Russia's export sector for manufactures into the world economy. Much of what is to be
established by the proposed project is required by WTO and therefore would need to be sustained as long
as Russia desires to remain a member in good standing. The proposed project builds upon initiatives
already introduced by the Government including the commitment of significant resources to the proposed
project, such as investing in the preparation of qualified personnel, on an ongoing basis, to maintain
technological currency. At the level of the exporter, increasing market orientation would result in
continuous need for current standards information. Consequently, GOST would be well prepared to



Technical Annex
Russia: Standards Development Project                                               Page 22
sustain increased demand for its services while helping keep Russian manufacturers informed of the latest
development in international standards.
Project Benefits
47.           This project is likely to have high returns to the Russian Federation as a whole, because
it aims to promote the development of Russian exports, which are necessary for recovery and growth in
the economy. Increased manufactured exports would contribute to the diversification of Russia's export
base away from what is becoming an over reliance on natural resources. Greater export orientation of
manufactured products will enhance the competitiveness of Russian enterprises. If successfully done, this
will have a potentially strong demonstration effect for the manufacturing sector as a whole. Instituting
a standards and certification system in line with international practice, modernizing existing standards and
making them more accessible to the manufacturers would improve product quality and enhance the
reputation of Russian manufactured goods, both in the domestic and export markets. Facilitating the
accreditation of Russian testing centers will also help lower costs of entering export markets.
48.           From a policy perspective, the project would support the development of an institutional
framework for standards and certification, which is required for accession to the WTO, and result in a
reduction in exposure to arbitrary trade barriers imposed by trading partners, and external discipline
regarding Russia's trade policy stance. Over the longer term, the project would contribute towards an
enabling environment for continued dialog with the Government.
Project Risks and Mitigation
49.           The project is subject to the risk that the conditions for accession to the WTO will not
be completed and the expected evolution of standards harmonization and integration thus compromised.
However, the authorities are pressing ahead with accession to the WTO and the Bank and the IMF are
supporting this process through dialog and through proposed policy lending operations. From an
institutional perspective,the main risk is slow or inefficient utilization of funds due to unfamiliarity with
Bank procedures concerning procurement, disbursement and project management. While a Canadian
grant is already operational and financing consultancy services to reduce this risk, the project
implementing agency GOST, has met conditions of Board presentation by establishing a fully staffed
PPIU, which, from all indications is making good progress in preparatory work.
XI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Agreements Reached
50.          As agreed, GOST provided documentation on the structure and personnel of the PPIU,
including counterpart staff and foreign experts who have been identified in agreement with the Canadian
authorities. The latter agreement specified the Terms of Reference for each of the foreign experts,
ensuring that project implementation requirements are adequately reflected.
51.          As agreed, GOST has established the PPIU and appointed its Director and Finance
Officer, thereby fulfilling a condition of Boardpresentation. GOST will review with the Bank by March

STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
GOST
Background
1.           The Committee of the Russian Federation for Standardization, Metrology and Certification
(GOST) is the main agency responsible for the formulation and implementation of policies in the field
of standardization in Russia. GOST has existed for decades, being one of the founding members of the
International Standards Organization (ISO). It was a very large body under central planning, in principle
being responsible for monitoring the production of enterprises to ensure conformity to existing standards.
In the former Soviet Union all standards were mandatory, giving GOST a very far-reaching mandate.
In the process of economic transformation, GOST was given a much more narrowly defined role with
tasks that are now analogous to that of a national (or federal) standards body in a market economy.
GOST is ranked as a Ministry and reports to the Deputy Prime Minister (Economics).
Organizational Structure
2.            GOST has been substantially downsized since the late 1980s. Total employment declined
from some 90,000 to 30,000 currently, partly as the result of the dissolution of the USSR (the fonner
Soviet Republics forming their own standards bodies). As can be seen from the organizational chart
below, GOST currently has 19 scientific and research institutes, 9 plants where measurement (metrology)
equipment is produced, 101 centers for standardization and metrology (the so-called territorial bodies of
GOST), and a publishing house ("Standartizat"). About 1,600 people are employed in the research
establishments; 4,100 in the metrology equipment plants; and 19,500 in the centers for standardization
and metrology.
Responsibilities
3.           Development of mandatory standards required by legislation. Under the existing legal
framework GOST is responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory standards (i.e., those
that are defined by law).  Relevant laws in this connection include: on Standardization; on the
Certification of Goods and Services; on Consumer Protection; and on the Uniformity of Measurements.
These laws are intended to meet health, safety and environmental objectives or to ensure the
interchangeability of products. In contrast to the past, industries are responsible for the development and
adoption of their own voluntary standards for product or process specifications, subject to the generally
applicable mandatory health and safety related standards. Such voluntary standards are developed in the
context of technical committees for standardization that are organized and chaired by a firm or industry.
GOST's role is limited to publishing the standard once it has been adopted. All voluntary standards must
be reported to GOST, as it is the official registrar of standards in Russia (see below).
4.            Certification systems. GOST is also responsible for developing the certification systems
(criteria) that must be used to enforce the mandatory standards embodied in the relevant laws.
Certification systems for products are consistent with the various schemes in this domain that have been
developed by the ISO. GOST's involvement in the testing and certification of products on the basis of



Technical Annex
Russia: Standards Development Project                                                      Page 26
mandatory standards is limited. Most such certification is undertaken by accredited testing laboratories
that are independent of GOST. The number of such accredited labs has grown significantly during the
last two years. Standing at 332 in early 1993, the number had increased to 1,300 as September 1994.
GOST itself operates only 6 percent of all such bodies in Russia. Most testing laboratories are part of
branch Ministries, and have been part of the privatization process insofar as their sector has been
affected. Currently some 20 percent of the labs have been privatized. About 30 percent of all accredited
testing bodies are new entities.
5.             The Consumer Protection Law requires mandatory certification of both domestic and
imported products that may constitute hazards to human health, safety or the environment. Enactment
of this law was the rationale for the adoption of the Law on Certification. The following products are
subject to certification: foodstuffs, consumer goods, toys, cosmetics and perfume, certain chemicals, and
household appliances and electric/electronic equipment. A system (the GOST R system) has been
developed that establishes how certification of specific products and processes (whether to mandatory,
national standards, or voluntary standards) can be obtained, and sets out the criteria that must be met by
private testing labs for these to be accredited by GOST. The system is consistent with international
guidelines for certification that have been developed under ISO auspices, and is open to foreign
participation. As of September 1994, GOST has certified 475 accreditation bodies. As is the case with
testing labs, foreign as well as domestic bodies may apply for accreditation.
6.            Information dissemination. The collection and provision of information on standards and
certification systems is another task of GOST. It maintains a register of certification systems and
conformity marks. It is the body from which potential exporters to Russia can obtain information
regarding the products that are subject to mandatory certification, copies of the relevant legislative acts,
certification rules and procedures, as well as information on accredited certification bodies in Russia and
abroad, and data on the conformity marks accepted by GOST. GOST also maintains databases of foreign
standards to which Russian firms can turn for information on applicable standards in potential export
markets. In all, GOST currently has 7 automated databanks. VNIIKI, the body in GOST responsible
for the collection and dissemination of both Russian and foreign standards, also publishes standards and
has a substantial printing  operation.   GOST's territorial bodies also provide information on
standardization, metrology and certification.
7.             Relationship with the private sector. There are no formal barriers to entry facing foreign
specialized testing and certification bodies that seek to establish laboratories in Russia. However, foreign
entities have not been accredited to test/certify on the territory of Russia that products meet mandatory
health and safety standards. Foreign entities are restricted in their activities to certification that voluntary
industry-specific standards or international quality standards have been met.  GOST has accepted
certification of imported products by the Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS), (i.e., it accepts
certificates of conformity from 140 SGS labs around the world that meet the relevant mandatory Russian
standards). ' GOST also accepts imported products that have been certified to meet international standards
or those of major standards writing bodies such as DIN (Germany), BSI (United Kingdom), or AFNOR
(France). It is particularly interested in attracting foreign firms to certify Russian products for export
markets. Firms such as SGS, Lloyds and Bureau Veritas have been engaged in certification of Russian
firms for export (e.g., ISO-9000 quality certification in the aircraft and car industries).
1/     Some of the testing labs that have been accredited by GOST are located outside Russia.

8.            GOST does not have a monopoly over the development and enforcement of mandatory
standards.  There are some 24 "Central Certification Bodies" in Russia that are involved in such
activities, including the Ministry of Health, the State Committee on Nuclear Power Supervision, the State
Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision, and the State Committee for Construction. One
of the tasks that must be accomplished as part of the establishment of the WTO enquiry point is to ensure
that all such standards are collected in one database, and that foreign trading partners are informed of
ongoing developments. GOST is not directly involved in the formulation of voluntary standards. These
are the responsibility of industry.  Such standards are developed in technical committees for
standardization (of which there are currently 291).
Financial situation
9.            GOST has been under significant financial pressure the last three years and has been
forced to adapt to a situation where it must rely on fee-based services for an increasing share of its
income. Only its headquarters in Moscow is totally dependent on the Budget for its resources (this
consists mostly of wages for some 300 staff). Resources from the Government Budget currently account
for 39 percent of GOST's income. Fees received from accredited testing labs and certification bodies
account for a further 5 percent. All labs accredited by GOST are required to transfer to GOST a fixed
share of all fee income generated from testing products for conformity with mandatory (legislated)
standards. The use to which these funds may be put is earmarked by law: they must be used for activities
such as investment in equipment or participation in international certification activities. They cannot be
used to pay wages. Fees for testing or certification are based on a cost plus formula: total costs plus 30
percent. Fees for testing of products for conformity with mandatory (legislated) standards are set by the
Ministry of Finance in cooperation with GOST. The objective is that this activity be provided on a non-
profit basis. Fees for testing and certification of voluntary standards is unconstrained.
10.           GOST's metrology and testing and certification bodies depend to a large extent on income
derived from testing and certification, from contracts with industry, and from publishing. For example,
ROSTEST (Moscow), the major metrology and testing/certification agency of GOST in Moscow, derives
only 15 of its budget from the state, the remainder being financed through fees for testing etc. VNIIKI,
GOST's information agency also illustrates the shift towards external sources of income. It increasingly
charges for its information services.  For example, it has negotiated contracts with large Russian
enterprises that involve linking these firms on an on-line basis to its databases of standards. It has also
developed a database that contains information on more than 60,000 Russian enterprises, including
product lines and technical specifications and capacity. The Institute is attempting to capitalize upon its
networks with and knowledge of Russian industry to compile and sell such data and to undertake market
studies and similar analyses.
11.          It is expected that GOST's financial situation will improve over time as privatization
proceeds. Under a 3-year program of de-monopolization, it is expected that 10 of the 19 scientific and
research institutes will be spun off. However, by law, GOST's metrology, mandatory standardization,
and information functions cannot be privatized. In these cases the relevant bodies will remain public
entities with a non-profit status.

Appendix II
STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
WTO Disciplines on Standards
1.            There are two standards-related agreements in the recent Agreement establishing the
WTO. one on product standards and one on sanitary and phytosanitary measures.
Product standards
2.            The WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade has three major parts: (1) disciplines
dealing with the adoption of technical regulations and standards in Member countries; (2) provisions
dealing with conformity assessment, testing and certification; (3) and transparency provisions relating to
existing standards and certification procedures. Central government bodies must ensure that technical
regulations are not more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective, and are applied
on a non-discriminatory basis. Where relevant international standards exist or are near completion, they
should be used as a basis for technical regulations, except if this would be ineffective or inappropriate
because climatic or geographical factors or fundamental technological problems.  Product-specific
technical regulations should be worded in terms of performance rather than design or descriptive
characteristics.
3.            Whenever the technical content of a proposed technical regulation is not in accordance
with international standards, and if the regulation may have a significant effect on trade, the WTO
Secretariat is to be notified of the products to be covered by the proposed technical regulation, together
with a brief indication of its objective and rationale. Such notifications must allow enough time for
amendments to be introduced and comments taken into account. All technical regulations which have
been adopted must be published promptly. A reasonable interval between publication and entry into force
of a regulation must be maintained in order to allow time for producers in other countries to adapt their
products or methods of production.
4.            In the preparation, adoption and application of voluntary standards, central government
standardizing bodies are to comply with a Code of good practice. This code requires, inter alia, that
activities of standardizing bodies conform to WTO's MFN and national treatment principles, as well as
the various requirements applying to technical regulations. At least once every six months, standardizing
bodies are to publish a work program containing their name and address, the standards currently under
preparation and the standards which were adopted in the preceding period. The work program is to
indicate the classification relevant to the subject matter, the stage attained in the standard's development,
and the references of any international standards taken as a basis. Work programs are to be notified to
the ISO/IEC Information Centre in Geneva.
5.            Conformity assessment procedures are to be applied on a nondiscriminatory basis,
expeditiously, and with respect for confidentiality requirements. Procedural requirements are very similar
to those applying to the development of national standards. If relevant guides or recommendations issued
by international standardizing bodies exist, central government bodies are to use these in their conformity
assessment procedures. If they do not exist, and the procedure used may impact significantly on trade,
countries are to publish them at an early stage, notify the WTO Secretariat, and allow for comments.



Technical Annex
Russia: Standards Development Project                                                   Page 30
WTO members are, wherever practicable, to formulate and adopt international systems for conformity
assessment and become members thereof or participate therein. The results of conformity assessment
procedures by central government bodies in other Members are to be accepted, even when those
procedures differ from their own, provided they are satisfied that those procedures offer an assurance of
conformity with applicable technical regulations or standards equivalent to their own procedures.
Members are encouraged to enter into negotiations for the conclusion of agreements for the mutual
recognition of results of each other's conformity assessment procedures.
6.            The third component of the standards agreement pertains to information about technical
regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures. Each Member of the WTO is to establish
an enquiry point which is able to answer all reasonable enquiries from other Members and interested
parties in other Members as well as to provide the relevant documents regarding: (1) any technical
regulations adopted or proposed within its territory by central or local government bodies, by non-
governmental bodies which have legal power to enforce a technical regulation; (2) any standards adopted
or proposed within its territory by central or local government bodies; (3) any conformity assessment
procedures, or proposed conformity assessment procedures, which are operated within its territory by
central or local government bodies, or by non-governmental bodies which have legal power to enforce
a technical regulation, or by regional bodies of which such bodies are members or participants; (4) the
membership and participation of the Member, or of relevant central or local government bodies within
its territory, in international and regional standardizing bodies and conformity assessment systems, as well
as in bilateral and multilateral arrangements within the scope of this Agreement; they must also be able
to provide reasonable information on the provisions of such systems and arrangements; (5) the location
of relevant notifications and documents; and (6) the location of the enquiry points. Governments are also
to take measures to ensure that enquiry points are also able to answer enquiries regarding standards
adopted or proposed within its territory by non-governmental standardizing bodies, or by regional
standardizing bodies of which such bodies are members or participants; as well as conformity assessment
procedures operated by non-governmental or regional bodies.
Sanitary and Phyto-sanitary Measures
7.            The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures applies to all
sanitary and phytosanitary measures which may, directly or indirectly, affect international trade. A
sanitary or phytosanitary measure is defined as any measure applied: to protect animal or plant life or
health from risks arising from the entry, establishment or spread of pests, diseases, disease-carrying
organisms or disease-causing organisms; to protect human or animal life or health from the risks arising
from additives, contaminants, toxins or disease-causing organisms in foods, beverages or feedstuffs; to
protect human life or health from risks arising from diseases carried by animals, plants or products
thereof, or from the entry, establishment or spread of pests; or to prevent or limit other damage within
the territory of the Member from the entry, establishment or spread of pests. Sanitary or phytosanitary
measures include all relevant laws, decrees, regulations, requirements and procedures, including product
criteria; processes and production methods; testing, inspection, certification and approval procedures;
quarantine treatments; provisions on relevant statistical procedures and risk assessment methods; and
packaging and labelling requirements directly related to food safety.
8.            Sanitary or phytosanitary measures may be applied only to the extent necessary to protect
human, animal or plant life or health, are based on scientific principles and are not to be maintained
without sufficient scientific evidence. Such measures may not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate
between Members where identical or similar conditions prevail, or be applied in a manner which would



Technical Annex
Russia: Standards Development Project                                                      Page 31
constitute a disguised restriction on international trade. The measures employed are to be based on
international standards, guidelines or recommendations, where they exist. Sanitary or phytosanitary
measures which result in a higher level of protection than would be achieved international standards may
be used if there is a scientific justification, or if justified by the implementation of risk assessment
techniques developed by the relevant international organizations.
9.             Sanitary or phytosanitary measures must be based on an assessment of the risks to human,
animal or plant life or health, taking into account risk assessment techniques developed by the relevant
international organizations. In the assessment of risks available scientific evidence must be taken into
account; as well as relevant processes and production methods; inspection, sampling and testing methods;
the prevalence of specific diseases or pests; the existence of pest-or disease-free areas; ecological and
environmental conditions; and quarantine or other treatment. In determining the measure to be imposed,
account must be taken of economic factors as well, including: the potential damage in terms of loss of
production or sales in the event of the entry, establishment or spread of a pest or disease; the costs of
control or eradication in the territory of the importing Member; and the relative cost effectiveness of
alternative approaches to limiting risks. The measures used should not be more trade restrictive than
required to achieve the appropriate level of protection, taking into account technical and economic
feasibility. Conformity assessment procedures and fees are to be based on MFN and national treatment,
procedures and criteria are to be published, confidentiality respected, and an appeals procedure
established.
10.            Members must publish all sanitary and phytosanitary regulations which have been adopted
and allow for a reasonable interval between the publication of a regulation and its entry into force in
order to allow time for producers in exporting Members to adapt their products and methods of
production to the requirements. An enquiry point must be created which is responsible for the provision
of answers to all reasonable questions from interested Members as well as for the provision of relevant
documents regarding: (a) any sanitary or phytosanitary regulations adopted or proposed within its
territory; (b) any control and inspection procedures, production and quarantine treatment, pesticide
tolerance and food additive approval procedures, which are operated within its territory; (c) risk
assessment procedures, factors taken into consideration, as well as the determination of the appropriate
level of sanitary and phytosanitary protection; (d) the Membership and participation of relevant bodies
within its territory in international and regional sanitary and phytosanitary organizations and systems, as
well as in bilateral and multilateral agreements and arrangements, and the texts of such agreements and
arrangements. A single central government authority is responsible for the implementation, on the
national level, of the notification provisions of the agreement.
11.           Whenever the content of a proposed regulation is not substantially the same as the content
of an international standard, guideline or recommendation, and if the regulation may have a significant
effect on trade of other Members, the WTO Secretariat must be notified of the products to be covered
by the regulation together with a brief indication of the objective and rationale of the proposed regulation.
Such notifications must occur at an early stage to allow amendments to be introduced and comments taken
into account.

plus the institutes, ministries and regional centers listed above, which maintain local standards, product
specification and certification databases. The Enquiry Point data center system will be a large network
and document database server system, including document scanners, optical storage and extensive
document database management and communications software. The institute, ministry and regional center
systems will house local databases for both local and remote access, and provide general network access
for local users. All systems will be equipped with software tools for development of local databases and
applications.

3.              Network access for local exporters will require no more than a personal computer and
modem to connect to the nearest regional system for access to the entire network. Access to Russian
standards information from abroad will be addressed by interconnection with the international Internet
network, using the facilities of the World Wide Web (WWW) and readily available document browser
software. The formatting of WWW documents is consistent with that used by WTO for its own
documents, which will result in improved project efficiencies and reduced implementation and
maintenance costs. A secondary benefit of having a nationwide network bridged to the Internet is the
provision of electronic mail to facilitate internal and external communications. A future benefit of the
Internet connection will be to provide Russian exporters with access to its increasingly important research,
marketing and communications facilities.
Project Implementation
4.              The primary application for the GOST network is the maintenance and dissemination of
standards documents and associated reference information. Electronic mail to facilitate both internal and
external communications is a secondary application. Rather-than building its own international network,
GOST will use the worldwide Internet to exchange standards information with many foreign institutions
(e.g. WTO, ISO, ANSI, DIN, IEEE, etc.) and firms. Since the Internet is not so well established
throughout the many regions of Russia, GOST will interconnect its own systems (and local exporters)
using an established Russian network, of which there are only a few to choose from. Geographic
coverage is one of the most important selection criteria, along with cost and reliability of service.
5.              The network, standards databases and the document management and dissemination
applications will take approximately two years to implement and populate with the necessary information.
The roles and responsibilities of the various parties for project implementation are shown in the following
chart.

Project Operational Funding
6.            Once the network is operational, funds to cover operational costs will be obtained from
the following sources:
(i)    Government budget to cover services provided to and by government ministries, and for
the facility and utility costs for operating the network and computers at the primary data
center, GOST institutes and regional centers.
(ii)    Fees for documents and information provided to foreign enquirers (except for summary
standards information that must be provided free under WTO rules).
(iii)   Fees for documents and information provided to Russian firms, although these will have
to be introduced gradually since many Russian firms are cash-short and are not used to
paying for information.
(iv)   Fees for possible value-added services provided to Russian firms, such as Internet access
and maintenance of on-line product specifications, catalogs and marketing information.
(Specifications are currently maintained free of charge.) To accommodate the volumes
of new and existing standards documents, the systems will require approximately 50GB
of storage, split between on-line (fixed disk) and near-line (optical disk jukebox) media.
Scanners and "Optical Character Recognition" (OCR) software will be provided for some
of the graphics workstations to facilitate conversion of existing documents to electronic
form.

Appendix V
PPIU ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS
A.    Project Preparation and Implementation Unit
1.           The Project Preparation and Implementation Unit (PPIU), created to administer the project
on behalf of the Government, will report to senior management officials in GOST. The PPIU will be
responsible for daily direction and coordination of project implementation and assisting the Ministry, Data
Center, Certification units and other participants with implementation requirements. It will have
contracting authority and will administer funding flows, monitor progress under the components, and
report to the Government, World Bank and other donors, as appropriate, on management issues and
progress with overall implementation.
2.           The PPIU established by GOST is already in place and ready for limited project
implementation. The PPIU will operate at full capacity for about two years during project start up and
initial implementation, and will then be scaled back in phases to a smaller staff needed for accounting and
residual reporting for the remaining two years. PPIU staff would be trained and/or assisted by local and
expatriate specialists and consultants under contract (e.g., procurement, audit, ISO systems/information
technology). As major project elements are completed, PPIU functions will probably be absorbed into
relevant divisions of GOST, completing the project's parallel objectives of institutionalization.
3.           The proposed PPIU organizational structure is illustrated in the chart below.

Russia: Standards Development Project                                               Page 42
4.            The PPIU is led by a qualified Project Director, who is an employee of the Government.
Principal PPIU divisions will be staffed by Russians, but they will need technical assistance, at least
initially, for establishing and running their units. Foreign consultant assistance (an Operations Specialist
working with the Director and principal officers) would ensure compliance with procedural requirements
and prompt and efficient implementation of the PPIU's technical, administrative and training management
functions. PPIU staff would also be trained by World Bank specialists in disbursements, project
accounting and reporting. Consulting assistance would be secured via contracts with qualified firms in
procurement, computer equipment and systems design, and for the conduct of required independent
audits. The PPIU's budget would also enable the engagement of other consultant services that might be
needed as ISO database and training / expert exchange / study tour activities get fully underway.
5.            PPIU divisions will be providing guidance and operations oversight to implementation
managers in the Data Center and involved Institutes and Ministries. The PPIU will also be providing
these participants with administrative support regarding major procurement and disbursement actions, and
World Bank approvals associated therewith. The PPIU will also be responsible for setting up the overall
project accounting system, and arranging for periodic audit services, as required by the World Bank.
Funds for PPIU activities and its consulting assistance contracts will be provided by the Loan and by
GOU budgetary resources.
B.    PPIU Organizational Structure
6.            The PPIU will consist of a management section and three functional service units:
Training Coordination, Finance, and Administration.
PPIU Management
7.            The PPIU is headed by a full-time Project Director with overall responsibility for project
administration. The Director is an employee of the Government and appointed by, and reporting directly
to, GOST.  To fulfill his assigned responsibilities, the Director is authorized to recruit, manage and
supervise the PPIU's domestic employees and its expatriate consultants, and to decide and execute PIU
operations. The Director will be assisted by a senior expatriate Operations Specialist, who will likely be
funded by the proposed bilateral grant. The PPIU may also reserve some funds for other expatriate
assistance, such as for solving unforeseen technical problems, conducting additional training or, e.g.,
legal services.  The Director is expected to engage other technical assistance, such as for required
periodic audit services and procurement management assistance. The Director will regularly liaise with
the World Bank's project staff and visiting supervision missions.
PPIU Program Direction and Support Functions:
*     engaging contractors and providing oversight for the installation of Data Center and
communications systems' equipment, software and operations/maintenance services;
*     planning and coordination of training, expert exchanges and study tour activities to ensure
timely and efficient implementation;

Procurement Services Unit
8.           The PPIU will assist project participants by providing (contract) procurement services,
such as information on guidelines and procedures, assistance with document preparation and the provision
of technical support on a case by case basis. In this regard the Procurement Services Unit will work in
close cooperation with the Director, Finance Office and the Administration Unit. The Procurement
Services Unit would also assist participants, where appropriate, by arranging for collective procurement
for items of a similar nature, especially complex computer equipment and testing equipment purchased
from external suppliers. The Procurement Services Unit will establish an information base on potential
suppliers of goods and services which can be utilized by participants. The Procurement Services Unit
will also provide information and data as needed to support the engagement of technical assistance
services and the purchase and/or harmonization of databases and priority standards.
9.            The Procurement Services contractor will be required to, inter alia:
*     Set up the project procurement system and basic operations manual, including essential
steps for relevant procurement modes, e.g., Local/International Shopping, NCB, DC,
ICB actions;
*     Develop procurement strategies, bidding packages, solicit for major program purchases
and answer questions about the process;
