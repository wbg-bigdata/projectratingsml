REPORT AND RECOMffENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE SODEPALM COMPANY
TO BE GUARANTEED BY THE REPUBLIC OF THE IVORY COAST
FOR THE THIRD OIL PALM PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the SODEPALM Company (Soci6t6 pour le.D4veloppement et 1'Exploitation
du Palmier A Huile), to be co-signed by Societe PAIMIVOIRE, with the guarantee of
the Republic of the Ivory Coast, for the equivalent of US$2.6 million to help
finance a project for the development of 10,500 ha. of industrial and out-
grower oil palm plantations.. The loan would have a term of fifteen years
inoluding five years of grace, with interest at (7-1/4) percent per annum.
The Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Eoonomique will co-finance the project in
so smit of $2.6 milliom.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report on the Ivory Coast, Report
N  296-IVC "Current Economic Situation and Prospects of the Ivory Coast",
April 11, 1974 which is based on an economic mission in April of 1973,
confirmed the country's creditworthiness. The report analyzed the country's
economic growth record, which has been favorable by international standards.
It concluded that prospects for further development remain good and that the
Government's development efforts require and deserve continued external
support. 'While the recent developments in oil and other export and import
commodity prices will require substantial quantitative changes in the Balance
of Payments estimates from those made when the report was prepared,
preliminary calculations show that the conclusions of the report are still
valid. Tentative estimates of the impact of the price increases on the
econonx of the Ivory Coast have been incladed in this Report. Annex I
contains basic country data.
3.        Throughout the 1960's, the Ivory Coast's economic growth has been
rapid. GDP has grown at an annual rate of 7.5 percent in real terms and in
1972 per capita income reached US$350. Although the growth could not be
fully sustained in the early 1970's due to deteriorating terms of trade and
adverse weather conditions, growth in 1971-73 still averaged 6 percent a year,
in real terms. Factors contributing to rapid growth were the Government's
liberal and pragmatic economic policies which have made the country attractive
to foreign investors, the availability of ample land and timber
resources, the existence of a large pool of labor including immigration from
neighboring countries and, dur-Lng the late sixties, rising commodity export
prices. Recognizing the country's vulnerability in its dependence on three
export commodities (cocoa, coffee and wood constitute 80 percent of total
exports), the Government began after 1965 ;o diversify agriculture by intro-
ducing or expanding oil palm, zoconut, p.0-eappl1, rice, rubber and sugar
cultivation - ana by placing more emphasis on other economic sectors such
as industry, mining and tourism.  Although the full results of these diversi-
fication efforts are still some years off, the prospects are that the Ivory
Coast will gradually become less dependent on a few major exports.



4.        The Government's development objectives include, in addition to
broadening the production base, the extension of economic infrastructure in
such fields as transport and power, the improvement of urban facilities,
regional diversification in agricultural production, the development of secondary
industrial centers, the development of education and the ivorization of the economy.
These objectives correspond well to the needs and the possibilities of the country.
Past and ongoing development has laid a solid foundation for further growth. More-
over, Government and private investment activities indicate that the country's
growth possibilities are being recognized and exploited.
5.        The Government's awareness of social problems is expressed in the
current Plan (1971-1975) and its emphasis on the income effects of development,
regional balance and education is stronger than in the past.    The
Government has adopted a policy of developing regional alternatives to the
concentration of investments in Abidjan and of improving the quality of life
in rural areas as a tool to neutralize certain imbalances in the Ivorian
economy. In spite of these policies the Ivorian Plan will, however, need
to focus more sharply on problems of urbanization, prospects of employment
in both rural and urban areas and income distribttion. To assist the
Government in the process of preparing the next Five-Year Plan (1976-80),
a special Bank employment mission, which received assistance from ILO staff,
visited the Ivory Coast in April 1973. The mission report has been discussed
with the Government and is expected to be issued shortly. The mission
identified the employment problem as one of growing imiaalances: while the
overall increase in labor demand was about equal to supply including immigra-
tion, there is likely to be a shortage in rural areas and a surplus
in urban labor markets. The mission also singled out a number of issues for
further study-, including the costs and benefits of creating a better economic
and social infrastructure in secondary centers combined with a certain degree of
industrialization and suggested changes in educational and training systems.
6.        This element of balanced regional development - an objective of the
current Plan - is consistent with and in fact one of the essential elements
of the Government's development strategy towards further diversification of
the economy. Until recently, growth of production took place predominantly
within the triangle Abidjan-Man-Bondoukou in the country's forest zone. To
ease the pressure on this development area and to implement its diversifica-
tion policy - both essential elements in sustaining the momentum of economic
growth - the Government realized that new land should be made accessible.
Consequently, substantial investments have been allocated to open up and
equip with a basic infrastructure new areas in the center-north (the Kossou-
Bouak6-Ferkessedougou area) and the south-west (the San Fedro-Man area).
Benefitting from those initial investments, especially in the latter area,
are forestry and agricultural activities like the growing of coffee, cocoa,
rubber, coconut and oil palm.



- 3 -
7.        In the short run (1974-75) most export products of the Ivory Coast
are expected to remain in strong demand and export receipts will therefore
grow rapidly. However, inports will probably rise even more because of high
inflation rates in supplier countries and higher prices for food, fertilizer
and oil in particular. The net oil import bill is expected to go up from
US$15 million in 1972 to US$70 million in 1974 and US$ 80 million in 1975 or
from 3 percent of 1972 commodity imports to 7 percent of forecast 1975 imports.
The resulting resource gap will be about US'$50 million in 197L and US$65
million in 1975, the equivalentof 3.3percent of total exports of goods e.nd
non-factor services. In the past, the Ivory Coast had enjoyed resource sur-
pluses: US$55 million a year during 1968-1970 and US$4s million during
1970-72.
M.        Based on past experience, Ivory  Coast's economy may be expected
to be responsive to the new challenges in the longer run (1976-1980).
Good growth prospects in several sectors will facilitate the necessary
structural adjustments to be induced by the Government. The Ivory Coast
has a substantial potential to increase its electricity generation from
hydro sources. Sites additional to the two in operation now were already
under investigation before the oil prices went up and it is quite conceivable
that under the new circumstances the program for hydro electric development
could be speeded up. The possibility of a relative advantage in the longer run
in the energy sector may accelerate the implementation of the Government's policy
to process raw materials locally rather than exporting them in unprocessed
form as is still the general practice. The Government's policy of establish-
ing processing industries for wood and locally grown cotton, rubber and palm
oil is expected to benefit from higher prices for these products. On balance,
there is no firm reason for a major downward revision of the earlier
established long-term growth prospects of 6 percent per year in real terms.
9.        Current Bank forecasts indicate that prices in current terms
of coffee, cocoa and timber, products which constitute 80 percent of Ivory
Coast's total exports, will go up gradually in the 1975-85 period. However,
prices for imported goods are expected to continue to rise as well. Prelimi-
nary calculations show that a resource gap might result in the order of
US$;70-90 million in the early 1980's as against an earlier projection of an
equilibrium in the goods and non-factor services account. Although our pro-
jections must be refined and confirmed, these preliminary indications point
to a substantial increase in the need for external funds. A basic economic
mission scheduled for next year will evaluate the country's long-term prospects
in the context of the draft 1976-80 development plan. This evaluation would
include a thorough reexamination of our projections, the underlying assumptions
and especially the consequences for Ivory Coast's external borrowing requirements.



10.       Based on the situation before the price increases, it was estimated
that financing of a reasonable public investment program of around US$300 mil-
lion in 1974-75 would require a large increase in external aid. It was calculated
for 1974-75 that, assuming a continuation of Government revenues well over 20
percent of GDP, about US$180 million per year would have to be financed by
disbursement of grant and loan funds and increased mobilization of private
domestic savings. Based on the pattern of disbursement in recent years -
US$1Z5 million in 1971, US$105 million in 1972 and an estimated US$150 mil-
lion in 1973 - it seemed likely that funds of this magnitude would be available.
Financing assistance would be contributed by the Ivory Coast's traditional aid
donors - France, Germany, Italy, the European Community - and by more recent
lenders of Ivory Coast - the United States, Canada, Denmark, the African Devel-
opment Bank and the World Bank Group. Most of the increase in the inflow was
to be financed by international organizations in order to allow a decline in
borrowing from more expensive private sources. Under certain assumptions
regarding loan terms, the debt service ratio would rise from its presen.ly
rather low level of around 7.5 percent (7.9%o in 1972) to about 15 percent in
the early 1980's. Total external public debt stood at US$698 million on
December 31, 1972.
11.       The recent acceleration in price increases has led to an increase
in the need for foreign capital of US$50-70 million in 1974 and 1975. Since
about 60 percent of investments in the Ivory Coast take place in the public
sector, a substantial part of the increased needs for financing from abroad
may be expected to occur in the public sector. The absorptive capacity in
terms of projects is substantial, particularly since there is scope to accel-
erate the implementation of hydro-electric projects and the establishment of
processing industries based on local raw materials.
12.       The economic and fiscal performance of the Ivory Coast in the past
justifies the assumption that requirements for additional funds will be kept
at a reasonable level and that the country will be able to obtain those funds.
However, with the increase in capital requirements, the terms are becoming
increasingly important. If for instance an increasing amount of future
capital needs would be covered on terms offered in the Eurodollar market -
to which the Ivory Coast has access - the debt service could substantially
surpass the level of 15 percent projected for the 1980's. To keep the
debt service manageable and to enable the Government to implement its devel-
opment policy, it is desirable that foreign capital be made available on as
concessionary terms as possible, including long repayment and grace periods.
However, in view of the still low debt service ratio, the good future growth
potential of the economy and the expected increase in export earnings, the
Ivory Coast remains creditworthy for substantial additional borrowing from
the BWn*.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE IVORY COAST
13.       Since 1968, the Bank's lending to the Ivory Coast has expanded
rapidly, and now includes twelve loans totalling US$119.8 million and an
IDA credit of US$7.5 million. Four of these thirteen operations have been
for roads; five were to the member companies of the SODEPALM Group for the
development of oil palm and coconut plantations and the construction of two
oil mills; the remaining four loans were for education, cocoa, a.rubber plantation
and a telecommunications project presented to the Executive Directors on April
30 of this year. The IFC also has a small (US$200,000) participation in
the Banque Ivoirienne de Developpement Industriel. Annex II contains a
summary statement of Bank Group operations and notes on the execution of
ongoing projects with particular reference to those whicn are encountering
problems in execution and giving rise to delays in disbursements.
ih.       The agricultural sector remains the principal foreign exchange earner
and domestic employer.    It continues to prcvide close to 90 percent of
exports, to employ a majority of the population, to help stabilize an increasingly
mobile population, and to bring development to remote areas of the country.
Our principal efforts are, therefore, in this sector. A Cocoa Project has
been appraised and will be submitted to the Executive Directors in the near
future. A cotton project has been appraised for submission early next year
and an agricultural resettlement project is under preparation for FY76.
We are also participating with the Caisse Centrale de Coop6ration Economique
(CCCE) in preparing a rice project in the West of the Ivory Coast. The Gov-
ernment has also requested our assistance in financing additional oil palm
and coconut development in the Ivory Coast's South-West, and in providing
agricultural credit.
15.        In support of agricultural development, we have placed considerable
emphasis on transportation and have become the principal lender for road
construction and maintenance. This is due largely to the fact that the Bank
was closely associated, as Executing Agency, with the 1968 UNDP Transport
Survey of the Ivory Coast. We expect that projects identified by this survey
will continue to be submitted to the Bank Group for financing in the next
few years, in particular the Abidjan-Agboville and Katiola-Badikaha roads.
The Government is also interested in obtaining our assistance in financing
the realignment of a section of the Abidjan-Ouagadougou rail line. Other
sections of the rail line are being financed by the FED and the EIB.
16.       Urban infrastructure and education are two important social sectors
in which we are involved, although our financial participation should remain
relatively modest. The UNDP is financing a two-phase study of the sanitation
needs of Abidjan and this study will provide the basis for an urban sanitation
project for Abidjan in the near future. A study of the development of a new
quarter of Abidjan is being financed with Bank funds. With regard to



-6 -
education, we are closely associated with the Governmant's efforts to
modernize its educational system principally at the secondary and vocational
levels. A second education project is presently being prepared with the
assistance of UhXGSCO. Substantial investments are also foreseen, in the
later years, for industry and power, areas in which we have not previously
been involved, but in which the Government foresees the need for the Bank
Group's participation.
17.       We have recently begun work on two new and innovative projects in
which the Government has expressed considerable interest. One of them, a
small enterprise project, will carry forward the special effort inaugurated
in Western Africa through a recent Bank study on the development of African
private enterprise. The second project concerns agricultural marketing, and
was brought to us by the Government. It should help us to come to giips with
the problems of food crop marketing, so important to the development of
modern agriculture. It would also benefit rural producers and urban dwellers
alike by assuring a constant now of food-stuffs to the cities at mo^e stable
prices.
lb.        Of total external lending to the public sector in the 1970-72
period,calculated on commitment basis,34 percent was provided by Governments,
25 percent by international organizations (of which 72 percent by the Bank),
23 percent came from private banks and through bond issues while 18 percent
came in the form of suppliers' credits. The finance not supplied by inter-
national organizations came mainly from four countries, France (30 percent),
USA (30 percent), Italy (22 percent), and Germany (9 percent). France and
Italy each supplied 30 percent of the total of suppliers' credits. France
and the European Economic Community remain the principal source of develop-
ment assist,nce in grant form. Altogether, grants accounted for 16 percent
of the total flow of foreign assistance to the public sector.
19.       Bank Group lending to the Ivory Coast,which has averaged about US$20
m- Lion per year in the five years since we began operations in the Ivory Coast,
~s expected to increase substantially over the next several years. The Bank
Group's share of the Ivory Coast's external debt is now approximately 1416
(including undisbursed) and may increase in the next five-year period to about
17%. The Bank Group's share of debt service is at present approxi-
mately 3% and is expected to increase substantially in the coming years.
PART III - AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
20.       Agriculture and forestry account for about 90 percent of the Ivory
Coast's exports and 27 percent of its GDP. They are the mainspring of the
country's growth and should remain so for many years to come. In 1972, the
Ivory Coast's exports were valued at CFAF 139.5 billion (US$545 million) and
three commodities - coffee (26 percent), timber (27 percent) and cocoa
(16 percent) accounted for about 70 percent of the value of total exports.
The real value of agricultural production and agricultural exports have regis-
tered during the last two years annual growth rates of about 8 percent and
2 percent respectively. Moreover, three-quarters of the population depend
directly or indirectly on activity in this sector. Average rural per capita
income including the value of subsistence production is roughly calculated
at CFAF 25,OOO (US$100) for 1970. Regional disparities are, however, very
large with the poorest areas being in the North of the country.



-7-
21.       Abundant land, good labor supply (including immigrant workers
mostly from Upper Volta) and generally favorable world markets for its
principal products have assured rapid growth of this sector. Through diver-
sification, the Govesnment has sought to reduce the country's dependence on
coffee and cocoa; efforts to increase the production of oil palm, bananas,
pineapples, coconuts, rice and rubber and to increase the exploitation of its
forest resources have been highly successful.  For example, 13,000 ha of
rubber trees have been planted since the mid-1950's and in 1971 rubber
production amounted to about 13,000 tons. The new plan calls for continued
diversification, modernization of both coffee and cocoa cultivation, more
careful management of forest resources and domestic processing of wood.
22.       Until recently efforts to improve agricultural productivity have
been focused on various individual export crops. Promotion of these crops
by specialized autonomous, public companies has been quite successful.
Food crop production did not generally benefit from this intensive promo-
tional effort and has begun to lag. The Government has now turned its
attention to this situation and the inter-related problems of rural poverty
and regional income disparities. Projects currently under preparation
support the Government' s planning. The Government has undertaken ambitious
development programs for cotton, rice and sugar as part of its plan for
regional development. As a result, cotton production has risen in the last
three years to about 50,000 tons of seed cotton. Rice production has reached
380,000 tons of paddy in 1971 and plans call for nn increase of 170,000 tons
by 1977. A sugar project in the North of the country is under construction
and is sez:sctsd to produce 60,000 tons of sugar and provide over two million
doellrs in incoae to the population of the region.
P3,       Wood is one of the principal exports of the Ivory Coast which accounted
on average for 25 percent of total commodity export earnings over the 1970-73 period.
In 1972, about 3,3 million m3 of timber were exported, 95% of which in unprocessed
for-, <the total roundwood production in that year amounted to 4.1 million m3.  The
Government is aware of the danger of depletion of the forest's valuable species.
It also realizes that, as part of its policy of industrialization in which process-
ing of local raw materials pla3s an important role, the forest has to be preserved to
guarantee long-term supply of raw material to local wood processing industsies. The
current Plan (1971-75) fo5esaw a gross production of logs of 3.5 million m; per year for
1970-75 and 4.0 million ml in 1980 with more than 40% of the latter being processed lo-
cally.In the fall of 1974 a Bank-supported FAQ mission is planned for the ivory Coast to
discuss preparation of a forest inventory to enable better forecasting of reserves and
to improve forest management. Tentative estimates indicate that the Ivorian forest
might still have some 100 million m3 of exploitable timber resources which would
enable another 15-20 years of forest exploitation.
2?.      In an attempt to diversify the country's economy, ovell USW30 million
has been invested in oil palm and coconut development in the Ivory Coast
since the early 1960's. The palm oil sector has now evolved into a highly
successful integrated agribusiness with nine mill districts served by estate
and outgrower plantings covering about 65,000 ha. In 1972, total production
amounted to 70,000 tons of palm oil and in 1973, it topped 100,000 tons.
Coconut production is less developed but over 20,000 ha. are under develop-
ment and exports of copra and eventually of coconut oil should reach sig-
nificant proportions in the near future.

26.      The project was prepared by S0DFP?ATA/1/ALMTV01TE.  It was appraised
in November o  last year at the conclusionl of extensive discussions with the
mara.gementC       DA;A,h PA12CTTORTZl and PALKINDUSTRIE (the Group) concerning
its f      c.ttr  - cpatinay _nd changes in its management structure.  A new Director

last year by a Ba.nk mission assisted by a represenitative of the CCCE, which
has agreed to cofinance the project in an amount of $2.6 million. The
project was negotiated on May 25, 1974. The Government delegation was led
by Mr. Andre Hovine, Director General of the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement
and the SODEPATUM delegation by its Director General, Mr. Amani Oka.   Other
members of the respective delegations were:   Mr. Guy Petitpierre, Secretary
General of PAL,IVOIRE, Mr. Victor 4magou, Deputy Director of SODEPALM, Mr.
LAon Naka, Deputy Director of the Caisse Autonome dtAmortissement and Mr.
Patrick B-    Adviser% Ministry of Firance,
27.     SODE?ATM, a -whclly governnernt-owned corporation, was established
in 196 to carry ot t'he Goveir-nrer-'s program for the development of oil
palr alad .:ccGna-t  -Ce;A sti  I-      she Government's oil palm and

two new companies were formed. PATI4INDLTSTRIE, to own the palm oil pro-
cessing facilities, and PAIMIVOIRE to manage the industrial oil palm
estates, the palm oil processing facilities and marketing. Both PALMINDUSTRIE
and PAD41_    l -'  a:se partlyr arivatelJvr rcnsd and were established in order
to bring private capital and managerial experience into this industry.
On the establishment of the two new corporations, the three companies entered
into a participation agreement (the Participation) for the development and
operation cf the industrial oil palm estates and of the mills. PALMIVOIRE

28.       Five loans were made in -969 and 1971 to member companies of
the SODEPAL4-PALIMINDUSTRIE-PALMT-V3-,4E joint venture.  The loans. assisted
in the financing of : i) the establishment of 4,000 ha. of industrial oil

29.         The present project is the final stage in the development of
SODEPAIMIs industrial and outgrower plantation east of the Sassandra River.When
oompleted, it will encompass about 100,000 ha of oil palm and ooconut small-
holder and industrial estates. It is an integral part of the Group's US$60
million program of investment through 1985 recently approved by the Group's
creditors including the Bank. The company is not expected to propose any
major new additions to its holdings in this area for several years to come.
It is expected that future development of oil palm and coconut production in
the Ivory Coast will be concentrated in the South-West of the country and will
be executed by a new development company.
30.         The project would be carried out from 1974 to 1979 and compriae:
(a) plantings of 5,000 ha of high yielding oil palm
by outgrowers, with the help of SODEPAIM's technical
and supervised credit services, to bring the total
area of oil palm outgrow holdings to 30,000 ha; and,
(b) planting or replanting 5,520 ha of high yielding oil
palm, of which 400 ha would be new hybrid lines, on
SODEPAIM estates.
31.         The development of the industrial estates would bs executed by
SODEPALM utilizing methods which have proven highly successful in the past.
1,600 ha would be planted on the Ehania estate, which has already benefited
from a Bank loan in 1969, 3,000 ha on the Okrouyo estate and 920 at the
Savanne de Dabou plantation. Land for estate planting would be cleared
mechanically by SMDEPALM, as has been the case in the past because the Ivory
Coast is unable to mobilize in a timely fashion large numbers of skilled men
needed to hand-clear the heavy vegetation. The equipment is available, and
mechanical clearing has proven very efficient. Initially, clearing was done
by contractors, but since 1970 SODEPALM has cleared land with its own equip-
ment at about 50% of previous contract prices.  An estimated 1,300 families
would participate in the outgrowers development component of this project,
of whom about half would be newly recruited. SODEPAIM now supervises about
6,500 oil palm outgrowers who cultivate an average of four heotares each.
The land is held gener.lly in "customary tenure", i.e. the community owne
the land. The usufruct but not ownership of it is allocated to smallholders
who retain it through continuous cultivation. This program has been very
satisfactory and no problems are anticipated in finding additional small-
holders.
Financing
32.        Project costs are estimated at CFAF 2.7 billion (about US$10.8
million), of which the foreign exchange component is about CFAF 1.3 billion
(about $5.1 million) or about 47X. Project costs include $1.4 million for
insecticides, fertilizers, vehicles, and equipment, $0.5 million for high
yielding palm oil seeds, $3.2 million for civil works and housing, $2.6
million for staff and labor, $0.3 million for plant nurseries and $2.8
million for unallocated. The Bank and CCCE together would finance about
48 Ib of the project's cost. The proposed Bank loan of US$2.6 million
equivalent would meet about half of the estimated foreign exchange cost
of the project. The other half would be met from a CCCE loan of the same
amount. It is expected that the CCCE loan would be at an interest rate of 5.5>
per annum with amortization conditions the same as those of the Bank loan.

Both loans would be to SODEPAIM/PALMIVOIRE, would be disbursed during the
five-year period 1974-79 and would be repaid over the years 1979-1989. The
remaining 526 of project costs would be met by SODEPAIM. The overall financing
plan for the proposed project is summarized below:

For administrative convenience, the Bank and the OCCE would disburse only
against the cost of development of the industrial oil palm estates.
Procurement
33.         Contraots over US$50,000 would be submitted to international
competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank Ruidnlines.ICB would be used
to procure goods and services estimated to cost U       m1.rmillion: fertilizer
and insecticides, uS$o.5 million; vehicles and equipment, US$0.9 million.
Local manufacturers would be given a preference of up to 15t6 over the
CIF prices.     High yielding palm oil seed estimated to cost US$0.5 mil-
lion would be supplied by IRHO _J, the only supplier of suitable material.
Civil works oonsisting of land clearing and earth estate roads, estimated
to cost US$2.7 million, would be carried out by force account. SODEPALM
has the equipment for this work and has demonstrated that it can conduct
it both efficiently and at costs equivalent to about 507 of the lowest con-
tractor bids. Disbursent of Bank and CCCE loans would be pari pasu for
industrial estate development, with institution eovering 35< of all expenses
incurred.
Loan Conditions
34.       The Government has agreed to submit to the Bank within twelve
months of loan effectiveness a plan for the processing and marketing of
SODEPAIM's coconut production. Other conditions in the Loan Agreement
conform generally to those contained in Loans 611-IVC and 760-IVC for the
First and Second Oil Palm and Coconut Projects. Furthermore, during a
recent review of the SODEPAIM Group's investment planning the Bank along
with the major creditors of SODEPAIM, the EIB and the CCCE, asked the
1/ Institut de Recherches pour les Huiles et Ol6agineux



Group to improve its accounting procedures and institute an internal audit
unit. These reforms are being undertaken and SODEPAIM is expected to con-
firm their implementation before loan signature.
Economic Justification
35.'      In the next several years SODEPAIM will be financing out of self-
generated revenues a major share of its own investment program as well as
having to meet substantial repayment obligations on outstanding debt.' Pro-
Jected palm oil prices indicate that the company's revenues will be sufficient
to meet these obligations and provide substantial net revenues which can be
used to expand the company's development activities or to pay dividends to
the Government. Such dividends are not expected, however, to exceed during
the next five years the Government's own oommitments to SODEPAIM's ongoing
investment program.
36.       Based on expected world prices for these commodities, the return
to the economy from the project investments is estimated to be about 235
The rate of return for the estate component alone is estimated at 20A, and
the rate for the outgrower component at 3556. As is often the case with
slowly maturing investments, the rates of return on all project components
are not very sensitive to changes in the value of output or to input prices.
37.       Primary benefits from the oil palm outgrowers and estate plantings
would be the increased production of palm oil and kernels and resultant net
annual incremental foreign exchange earnings amounting to about US$7.7 mil-
lion by 1987. The project would have substantial secondary benefits through
providing additional employment on the oil palm estates, as well as increasing
the number of smallholders. Additionally, it would further the Governmenu-'s
program of agricultural diversiiication directly through the project output,
and indirectly by providing resources with which to reinforce SODEPAIM's
financial position and development activities.
PAR?T V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
38.       The following documents are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately:
(a) The draft Loan Agreement (Third Oil Palm Project) between
the Bank on the one hand and SODEPALM and PALMIVOIRE on
the other;
(b) The draft Guarantee Agreement (Third Oil Palm Project)
between the Republic of the Ivory Coast and the Bank.
39.       In addition to the above, a report of the Committee provided for
in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement; and a draft
resolution approving the loan are being distributed to the' Executive
Directors separately.



- 12 -
40.       The draft Agreements contain provisions which in form and sub-
stance follow closely those contained in the equivalent Agreements for
the First and Second Oil Palm and Coconut Projects (Loans Nos. 611-IVC
and 760-IVC).
41.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PARI vI - RECOMMENDATION
42.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Loan.

of the Loan to take account of modified architectural standards. These changes
were notified to the Executive Directors (See Memorandum to the Executive
Directors R71-246 of November 3, 197i). The project has now entered the
construction phase with awards for seven of the schools having been made
recently.  Disbursements should soon resume at a normal pace.   Extension of

The Cocoa Loan has been amended to reduce the number of
hectares to be rehabilitated. Difficulties arose in supervising large numbers
of farmers who used project inputs to treat non-project cocoa. The Government
agreed to substantially reduce the size of the rehabilitation program. (See Memo
to the Executive Directors R73-74 of April 13, 1973).   The project is proceed-
ing. satisfactorily except for disbursements. Administrative problems have
delayed the submission of requests for reimbursement.
/ These notes are designed to infor-m the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, anid in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They
should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project
execution.
