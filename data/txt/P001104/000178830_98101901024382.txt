IVORY COAST
THIRD OIL PALM PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Background
i.        The Government of the Ivory Coast has asked the Bank to finance part
of the costs of completing its oil palm development program East of the
Sassandra River. The proposed loan of US$2.6 million would be the Bank's
final contribution toward the ongoing program which has been under way since
the middle 1960's, under the responsibility of an association of companies,
SODEPALM, PALMINDUSTRIE and PALMIVOIRE (the Participation). The project was
prepared by the Participation. The appraisal was made by a Bank mission in
November/December 1973.
Project Description
ii.       The project, which aims at further diversifying agricultural produc-
tion in forest and fringe savannah areas, and increasing farmers' income and
the country's foreign exchange earnings, would be carried out from 1974 to
1979 and would comprise:
(a) planting 5,000 ha with high yield potential oil palm by out-
growers, with the help of SODEPALM's technical and supervised
credit services, to bring the total area of oil palm outgrowings
to 30,000 ha;
(b) planting or replanting 5,520 ha with high yield potential oil
palm, of which 400 ha would be with new hybrid lines on
SODEPALM estates.
Project Execution
iii.      The principal entity involved in the proposed project is Societe
pour le Developpement et l'Exploitation du Palmier a Huile (SODEPALM), which
was founded in 1963 to develop the oil palm and coconut industries. It is
wholly owned by Government. It owns oil palm and coconut estates, and is
responsible for providing credit and supervision for the oil palm and coconut
outgrowers. PALMINDUSTRIE, which is 73% owned by Government, owns the palm
oil mills and ancillary installations needed to process the production from
estates and outgrowers. PALMIVOIRE, owned 40% by Government and 60% by
private interests, manages the SODEPALM oil palm estates and PALMINDUSTRIE
mills. PALMIVOIRE supplies all staff above the estate manager level. Its
operating standards and performance are very good. The oil palm outgrower
program, as well as coconut estates and outgrowers, is outside the scope
of the Participation, and SODEPALM has its own competent organization for
these. The financial condition of the entities involved in the project is
sound. Despite production costs that are 20% higher than anticipated, the
financial results for the Participation and for outgrowers have been better
than expected due largely to higher than anticipated prices for palm products.



- ii -
iv.       On January 1, 1974, in accordance with existing loan covenants,
qualified Ivorian citizens were appointed as Director and Deputy Director
General of SODEPALM/PALMIVOIRE, to replace former expatriate incumbents.
SODEPALM/PALMIVOIRE intends to retain the services of seven high level expa-
triates to fill key positions for which suitable Ivorian replacements have not
yet been found. Consequently, all key managerial positions continue to be
filled satisfactorily.
Cost Estimates and Financial Arrangements
v.        Project cost, net of import duties, is estimated at CFAF 2.7 billion
(US$10.8 million), of which the foreign exchange component is about CFAF 1.3
billion (US$5.1 million) or 47%. Cost estimates are based on February 1974
prices, and reflect the now ample experience with the national oil palm program.
Contingencies follow current Bank guidelines and in the aggregate account for
35% of base line cost estimates.
vi.       It is envisaged that the Bank and CCCE would share in equal pro-
portions the equivalent of the project's foreign exchange cost. This would
require a Bank loan totalling US$2.6 million, equivalent to 24% of total
project costs and about 50% of the estimated foreign exchange cost. The loan
would be to SODEPALM/PALMIVOIRE, and would be disbursed during the five-year
period 1974-78. The term of the loan would be 15 years, with a five-year
grace period for principal payments. The balance of project costs not covered
by IBRD and CCCE loans would be financed by SODEPALM, from self-generated
funds. A summary of the financing plan is given below:
Financing Plan
Estates        Outgrowers               Total
s$_000    x       - US$ 000    %       US$'000       %
IBRD                   2,600     29         -       -         2,600        24
CCCE                   2,600     29         -       -         2,600        24
SODEPALM               3,710      42      1,940      100      5,650        52
Total             8,910     _        1,940      100     10,850       100
vii.      Financial Arrangements for Outgrowers.  As under the ongoing program,
outgrowers would receive both credits and grants from SODEPALM.  About CFAF
80,000/ha (US$320/ha) would be credit for seedlings, land clearing, maintenance
of plantings, and fertilizer, and would be repayable in 9 years after a seven-
year grace period. Outgrowers would contract to sell all their produce to
SODEPALM, which would deduct payments due from the sales price. About CFAF
16,700/ha (US$67/ha) would be a grant, comprising the cover crop, wire netting,
and labor costs related to supply of seedlings. This is much lower than the
CFAF 63,800/ha and CFAF 48,300/ha provided as grants, respectively, under the
first and second projects. A reduction in individual grants is now possible
because the experience with ongoing programs is demonstrating that well planted



- iii -
and maintained oil palm can compete successfully with other crops in the project
area and, therefore, prospective participants would be less reluctant to join
the project than in earlier years.
Procurement and Disbursements
viii.     Contracts over US$50,000 would be subject to international compet-
itive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. ICB would be used to pro-
cure goods and services estimated to cost US$1.4 million: fertilizer and
insecticides, US$0.5 million; vehicles and equipment, US$0.9 million. Local
manufacturers would be given preference of 15% against bids quoted in CIF
prices. High-yielding palm oil seeds estimated to cost US$0.5 million would
be supplied by IRHO, the only supplier of suitable material. Civil works
consisting of land clearing and earth estate roads, estimated to cost US$2.7
million, would be carried out by force account. SODEPALM has the equipment,
and has demonstrated that it can conduct it both efficiently and less costly
than contractors. Of the remaining project costs, US$2.6 million would be
for staff and labor services, US$0.3 million would be for materials to
establish plant nurseries, US$0.5 million would be for housing, and US$2.8
million unallocated. Disbursement of Bank and CCCE loans would occur from
loan signature to the end of the 1978 calendar year. For administrative
convenience, the Bank and CCCE would finance pari passu, at 35% each, against
the estates component only. Disbursements would be against contracts, com-
pletion certificates and other documents certified by SODEPALM.
ix.       Primary benefits from the oil palm outgrower and estate plantings
would be the increased production of palm oil and kernels and resultant net
annual incremental foreign exchange earnings amounting to about US$8.8 million
by 1987.
x.        Based on expected world prices for these commodities, the returns
to the economy from the project investments are estimated to be about 23%.
The rate of return for the estate component alone is estimated at 20%, and the
rate for the outgrower component at 35%. The project would also have substan-
tial secondary benefits through providing employment for some 600 workers on
the oil palm estates, and creating some 265,000 mandays of work per year in
developing outgrowers holdings. It would further the Government's program
of agricultural diversification both directly, through the project output,
and indirectly by generating resources with which to pursue other programs.
Recommendations
xi.       The assurances and covenants of Loans IVC-611 and IVC-760 would be
continued substantially in the Third Oil Palm Loan. The project is suitable
for a Bank loan to SODEPALM/PALMIVOIRE for US$2.6 million repayable over
10 years after five years of grace on principal payments.






IVORY COAST
THIRD OIL PALM PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Ivory Coast has asked the Bank to finance
part of the costs of completing its ongoing oil palm and coconut development
program that is being carried out East of the Sassandra River (Map). The
objectives of the program are to increase output of coconut and oil palm
produce, to further diversify agricultural production in forest and fringe
savannah areas, and to increase farmers' inc,xnes and the country's foreign
exchange earnings.
1.02      The proposed loan of US$2.6 million would be the Bank's final contri-
bution toward the ongoing program, which has been underway since the middle
1960's under the responsibility of an association of companies, SODEPALM,
PALMINDUSTRIE and PALMIVOIRE, joined together in a Participation (the Partici-
pation). The Bank and the prospective cofinancer of the proposed project,
France's Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique, and the Government believe
that the completed program, which involves almost 100,000 ha of oil palm and
coconut and substantial processing and commercial operations, will require
the undivided attention of the Participation management. For this reason,
Government plans to assign responsibility for future development of oil palms
and coconuts (in the Southwest) to a different agency.
1.03      The project was prepared by the Participation.  This report is based
on the findings of a Bank mission which visited the Ivory Coast in November/
December 1973, composed of Messrs. Losson, Tillier and Winston.
1.04      The Bank has made seven loans for agricultural development in the
Ivory Coast: three totalling US$17.1 million in 1969 for oil palm and coconut
development; a loan of US$7.5 million in 1970 for smallholder cocoa production;
two oil palm and coconut loans of US$7 million in 1971; and a loan of US$8.4
million for a rubber project in late 1973. All of the projects financed have
been completed or are progressing satisfactorily (Annex 1).
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      The Ivory Coast has a land area of about 324,000 km , broadly
divided into two ecological zones. Tropical rain forest stretches across the
country in a belt reaching about 200 km inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and
further North the forest is replaced by savannah which covers the remainder
of the country. Shifting cultivation has led to the displacement of forests
by savannah, particularly in the center of the country.



- 2 -
2.02      Population is estimated at about 5.4 million, growing at about 3.3%
annually (including 1% growth from immigration). Small scale agriculture
provides about 80% of employment and, according to estimates, jobs for some
400,000 foreign workers, mainly from Upper Volta and Mali.
2.03      GDP amounts to about US$1.8 billion and exports to about US$0.5
billion (both 1972 figures). Due to the rapid growth of industry and urban
services, the share of agriculture (including forestry and fishing) in GDP
decreased from 36% in 1965 to only 27% in 1972. However, the agricultural
sector still accounts for 86% of all exports (CFAF 120.7 billion out of
CFAF 139.5 billion in 1972).
2.04      In 1970, 23% of the population lived in towns with more than
5,000 inhabitants; by 1985, this figure is expected to reach 43%. There is
also migration within the rural areas, from the savannah to the forest zone.
Population in cities is expected to grow at around 6%, that of the forest
zone at about 4%, and that of the savannah to decline by about 1% per year.
2.05      Migration is due largely to the wide income disparity between sectors
and regions. In 1970, when overall per capita income was CFAF 81,200 (US$325),
money incomes of rural inhabitants varied from CFAF 3,400 (US$14) in the North,
to CFAF 17,000 (US$68) in the central rain forest, and CFAF 23,600 (US$94) in
the South around AbidJan.
2.06      The forest zone produces the greatest share of agricultural output
and 86% of agricultural exports, with timber, coffee and cocoa being the most
important.  Since 1965, the government has undertaken a program of crop
diversification involving pineapples, bananas, coconut, oil palm and rubber
(the last three with the assistance of Bank loans). But coffee and cocoa
remain the most important crops for small scale agriculture, with almost
half of all farm families involvel in their production. A second cocoa project
is under consideration by the Bank.
2.07      In contrast, the savannah region is dominated by subsistence crop-
ping of maize, rice, cassava, sorghum, beans and peas. Livestock production
is generally limited to poultry and small ruminants, mainly goats; beef
production is limited by prevalence of tse-tse fly. Until recently, efforts
to improve savannah incomes have been limited to rice and cotton development
programs. A major program in cotton, rice and other food crops is now in
preparation with Bank assistance.
Development Strategy
2.08      Real growth in the economy has averaged about 7% per year over the
past decade. Government would like to maintain this high growth rate. Thus
policy emphasis is on commodity output increases, as well as on diversification,
and making exports competitive to protect them from adverse trends in world
prices. The economy is very dependent on foreign exchange, and as the country
does not possess commercially exploited mineral resources, there is no alter-
native to export crops as a source of foreign exchange.



- 3 -
2.09      Until recently, efforts to improve agricultural productivity have
taken the single crop approach ani have generally been successful. This
approach was helped by the countr-'s being virtually self-sufficient in food
except for livestock products. Urbanization is now changing the situation
and the need for increasing food production is pressing. Government is plan-
ning to tackle this problem and the related one of rural poverty in the food-
producing Savannah zone through regional programs involving a package of
improvements not only in agriculture but in the physical and social infrastruc-
ture. Projects currently under preparation for Bank financing support these
objectives.
B. Institutional Structure
2.10      Overall development planning is in the hands of the Planning Ministry,
while detailed plans and programs for crop production, forestry and fresh water
fisheries are the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture.  Execution of
these programs is entrusted to a number of agencies, some of which are State
companies, such as Societe d'Assistance Technique pour la Modernisation Agricole
de la Cote d'Ivoire (SATMACI) for coffee and cocoa development. Others are
foreign companies under contract to the Government, such as Compagnie Francaise
de Developpement des Textiles (CFDT) for cotton development.
2.11      The principal entity involved in the proposed project is Societe
pour le Developpement et 1'Exploitation du Palmier a Huile (SODEPALM), which
was founded in 1963 to develop the oil palm and coconut industries. It is
wholly owned by Government. It owns oil palm and coconut estates and is re-
sponsible for providing credit and supervision to oil palm and coconut outgrow-
ers. SODEPALM is part of a joint venture (the Participation) which additionally
involves PALMINDUSTRIE and PALMIVOIRE. PALMINDUSTRIE is owned 73% by Government
and 27% by private interests, and owns the palm oil mills and ancillary installa-
tions needed to process the production from SODEPALM estates and outgrowers.
PALMIVOIRE is owned 40% by Government and 60% by the same private interests
with minority ownership in PALMINDUSTRIE, and manages the SODEPALM oil palm
estates and PALMINDUSTRIE mills. PALMIVOIRE supplies all staff above estate
manager level. Its operating standards and performance are very good.
PALMIVOIRE does not directly provide services to outgrowers since the out-
grower program is outside the scope of the Participation, except in so far
as the Participation processes outgrower palm produce on a cost basis; coconut
development, both estates and outgrowers, is also outside the Participation.
Consequently, SODEPALM has its own organization for outgrowers and coconut
development. Profits or losses to the Participation are divided proportionately
among the three companies on the basis of their investments. PALMIVOIRE, whose
financial contribution is minimal, is remunerated for its management services
on a sliding scale based on financial results of the Participation as a whole.
The institutional structure is described in detail in the "Appraisal of the
Second Oil Palm and Coconut Project" (PA-89a, June 1, 1971).



- 4 -
2.12      Fonds d'Extension et de Renouvellement (FER).  This fund was set up
in conjunction with the Participation, at the request of the Fonds Europeen de
Developpement (FED), initially to finance modern housing for oil palm estate
workers and to assist in financing development of outgrower oil palm produc-
tion. Its revenues were to consist of (a) rent paid by SODEPALM on the estate
housing, and (b) transfers from SODEPALM of CFAF 0.80/kg of fresh fruit bunches
produced on the oil palm estates, as a form of repayment of the CFAF 8.3 bil-
lion grant Government received from FED to establish the first 32,000 ha of
SODEPALM estates. Because estate production has been in its initial stages,
transfers to FER under the levy on production have been small (CFAF 422 mil-
lion). Since FER was short of funds to carry out its housing program,
SODEPALM prefinanced its estate housing program, costing CFAF 2 billion. In
1973 and early 1974, FER borrowed money from Government sources and repaid
SODEPALM. Subsequently, Government decided that SODEPALM should own its own
estate housing outright, and should pay over 15 years the CFAF 2 billion
recently received from FER. As transfers to the FER from the levy on estate
production will increase rapidly in the years ahead, this fund is expected to
become a significant source of funds and Government would draw upon it to
help finance the outgrower development program (para 4.06) and to finance
oil palm and coconut development in the Southwest.
2.13      Agricultural Production Price Stabilization Agency.  The "Caisse de
Stabilisation et de Soutien des Prix des Productions Agricole" (CSSPPA) is re-
sponsible for carrying out Government agricultural price support policies. It
supports producer prices for cotton, cocoa and coffee growers in a conventional
manner: paying producers a guaranteed minimum price which it fixes annually,
selling the commodities on the world market, and absorbing profits or losses
on its operations. For oil palm, CSSPPA does not guarantee minimum prices
to outgrowers or to SODEPAIM, nor does it market oil palm products. Rather
its function is limited to moderation of drastic changes in world prices over
consecutive years. SODEPALM/PALMIVOIRE controls its own export sales and re-
ports export prices and volume to CSSPPA, which intervenes after the year's
results are known, but only if the average export prices for palm products vary
more than 10% in either direction from the year before. For instance, in the
event of a substantial increase in export price in one year relative to the
preceding year, SODEPALM would be called on to transfer revenue to CSSPPA on
the following basis: (a) none of the marginal revenue from the first 10% of
the price increase; (b) half of the marginal revenue from the 10-15% tranche;
and (c) four-fifths of the marginal revenue from any remaining price increase
above 15%. A similar formula applies for the transfer of funds from CSSPPA
to SODEPALM in the event of a price decrease. CSSPPA does not support coconut
prices.
2.14      Agricultural Research.  Agricultural research is undertaken by various
French organizations under technical assistance agreements with France, and
research costs are shared by the two Governments. Oil palm and coconut research
is undertaken by the Institut de Recherches pour les Huiles et Oleagineux
(IRHO). PALMIVOIRE has a department concerned with collection, processing
and end product research. Some of the results of research are described in
Annex 4.



C. The Oil Palm and Coconut Sector
Oil Palm Development
2.15      In the early 1960s Government initiated an oil palm development
program and established SODEPALM to carry it out. Financial help was obtained
from Fonds Europeen de Developpement (FED), Banque Europeenne d'Investissement
(BEI), Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE), and IBRD (Annex 1).
Some 65,000 ha of oil palms have been planted under the programs, of a national
total of 75,000 ha of improved oil palm; the balance was planted prior to the
SODEPALM program by private entrepreneurs. 55,000 ha, of various ages, are
now in production and exports of palm oil are growing rapidly:
Palm Oil Production and Exports

2.16      Both in its oil palm and coconut programs, Government has favored a
system of nucleus industrial estates surrounded by outgrowers, who are small
farmers plimting, as of now, an average of 4 ha each. Estates are considered
essential go the outgrower program through demonstrating the value of using
modern cultural practices, providing the potential outgrower with confidence
in the future of the crop, and supporting a range of services essential to
efficient production and high yields. Under this concept, nine development
districts have been established East of the Sassandra River, each based on
a palm oil mill and containing a mixture of estate plantings and outgrowers.
The network is complete basically but additional investments to develop the
potential of each district will be required until 1985 (Annex 3). Except
for the Bank and CCCE financing under the proposed project, all or most further
finance to complete the ongoing program probably would be self-generated by
the Participation.
Coconut Development
2.17      Coconut development has been carried out since 1969 simultaneously
with the oil palm program, and with financial help from the same sources
(para 2.15). SODEPALM is carrying out a 20,000 ha coconut program in line
with the schedule envisaged during the 1969 and 1971 appraisals. Project
plantings will be completed in 1976, and will substantially exhaust the
coconut potential of the zone east of the Sassandra River. In the beginning,
difficulties were met in implementing the outgrower program; but these diffi-
culties are now being overcome through providing more incentives to farmers.
Establishment of the coconut estates is satisfactory. Unit investment costs
have generally been in line with appraisal estimates. In the meantime,
varietal research is making substantial progress and future yields should be



- 6 -
higher than originally anticipated. Considering the highly favorable market
prospects for coconut, there is every reason to consider the coconut program
a success. By 1985, the Ivory Coast will produce only about 60,000 tons of
copra equivalent, a negligible percentage of world trade in coconut products.
2.18     CKoconut plantings will begin to mature in 1976 but a decision is
awaited as to how production will be processed and marketed. As this is im-
portant in respect of SODEPALM's financial position and ability to generate
funds, Government has been asked to submit to the Bank, within 12 months
after effectiveness of the loan proposed in this report, a plan to process
and market coconut production. An assurance on this point has been secured.
Investments and Finance for Oil Palm and Coconut Development (Annex 3)
2.19      The Participation has invested CFAF 30.2 billion (US$120.8 million)
in oil palm and coconut development, as of the end of 1972, as follows:
Investments          CFAF (billions)      US$ (millions)
Oil Palm Estates              15.123                 60.5
Oil Palm Outgrowers            3.937                 15.8

30.195               120.8
The total investment is about CFAF 2.5 billion more than was anticipated by
the Bank at tbr time of appraising the Second Oil Palm and Coconut Project in
1971 (Loans ITC 759 and 760) because investments have included expenditures
on social infrastructure and housing (CFAF 2 billion) and estate roads (CFAF
560 million), which under the original financing arrangements were not intended
to be financed by SODEPALM. Also, SODEPALM purchased land clearing and road
equipment costing 3ome CFAF 1 billion, to enable it to undertake work at lower
cost than previous contract arrangements, see para 3.07. Oil palm development
costs per hectare, however, are in line with the 1971 appraisal estimates.
The cost for oil palm estates is CFAF 260,000/ha. For the outgrower program,
the cost is CFAF 140,000/ha. Smallholders have received loans amounting to
CFAF 2.1 billion, and grants from Government of CFAF 1.6 billion. SODEPALM
now supervises about 6,500 oil palm outgrowers.
2.20      The sources of funds, as of the end of 1972, are summarized below:

Self-generated funds include profits, reserves and depreciation allowances.
Grants include a Government contribution of CFAF 3,780 million and FED grants
to Government of CFAF 8,363 million. Disbursements from the five IBRD lo&ns
account for CFAF 3.2 billion (US$12.8 million), or 10.6% of the total financ-
ing of Participation investments.
2.21      Financial results are discussed in Chapter 7.  Despite production
costs that are 20% higher than anticipated, the financial results for the
Participation and for outgrowers have been better than expected due largely
to higher than anticipated prices for palm products.
III. THE PROJECT
A. General
3.01      The project is the final stage of an ongoing investment program
aimed at the optimal exploitation of the oil palm growing potential of areas
East of the Sassandra River (Map). The project consists of oil palm planting
coupled with the necessary support activities to bring the plantings to
maturity.
The project comprises:
(a) plantings of 5,000 ha of hiigh yield potential oil palm by
outgrowers assisted by SODEPALM's technical and supervised credit
services, to bring the total area of outgrower oil palms
to 30,000 ha; and
(b) plantings or replantings of 5,520 ha of high yield potential
oil palm, out of which 400 ha would be new hybrid lines,
on SODEPALM estates.
The project would be carried out from 1974 to 1979.
B. The Planting Program
Outgrowers
3.02      The 5,000 ha of outgrower plantings would be divided among all
nine of the palm oil mill districts, and phased equally over the five years,
1975-1979 (Annex 4, Table 1). In general, the plantings would be as close
as possible to the mill sites. An estimated 1,300 farm families would be
involved, including 600-800 newcomers to the program.



-8-
Estates
3.03      1,600 ha would be planted on Ehania estate; the planting would
increase the area of this estate from 10,410 ha to 12,010 ha. This expansion
is based on the availability of an unutilized parcel of land in SODEPALM's
Ehania estate holding, which enjoys the best conditions for oil palm in Ivory
Coast. The plantings would be in conjunction with an expansion of processing
capacity in Ehania district financed by PALMINDUSTRIE. About 400 ha of IRHO's
new hybrid, E. Melanococca x E. Guineensis, would be planted in 1975 as part
of the 1,600 ha planting program. The characteristics of this hybrid are
described in Annex 4.
3.04      3,000 ha would be planted on Okrouyo estate, a new estate to the
west of Abidjan. This estate is within the collection perimeter of the
existing Soubre mill-estate complex.   The plantings have high priority to
provide a larger throughput for the Soubre oil mill, which would otherwise
have wasted capacity.
3.05      920 ha would be replanted on the Dabou estate, which was originally
planted in the 1950's with early experimental varieties that are now over-
aged and obsolete.
3.06      The schedule of plantings would be as follows:

C.  Estate Development
3.07      Development and Maintenance.  Land for estate plantings would be
cleared mechanically by SODEPALM, as has been the case in the past. While
mechanical clearing is more expensive than hand clearing, the Ivory Coast is
unable, because of the rapid pace of development in the rural sector, to
mobilize in a timely fashion the necessarily large numbers of skilled men
needed to hand-clear the heavy vegetation. Initially clearing was done by
contractors, but since 1970 SODEPALM has cleared land with its own equipment
at about 50% of the contract price.



-9-
3.08      Seedlings are raised by SODEPALM in its own nurseries, from seed
supplied by IRHO. SODEPALM also produces its own cover crop seed.
3.09      SODEPALM would ensure that all project plantings would be maintained
until the end of the third year after their planting. The maintenance require-
ments are small but important:  principal components are maintenance of the
cover crop, including circle weeding for each plant; replacement of dead
plants; and fertilizer applications and pest control.
3.10      Replanting the Dabou estate - 920 ha - would involve felling the
old palms, planting and maintenance, and controlling existing weed infestation.
The procedures involved in replanting are described in Annex 4. To meet the
planting schedule, the first phase of land preparation was started in 1973.
3.11      Estate Tenure.  Ehania estate is owned by SODEPALM.  The land on
which the Okrouyo estate is located is classified forest land owned by Govern-
ment. Dabou estate is Government property, and was put under SODEPALM manage-
ment in 1972. Transfer of ownership of both properties to SODEPALM was in
process at the time of appraisal, and no difficulties are expected. During
negotiations, the Bank received assurances that all facilities and title to
or rights in respect of land required for the carrying out and operating the
project would be provided to SODEPALM within one year of loan effectiveness.
D. Outgrower lield Development
3.12      There has been no shortage of applicants for participation in the
oil palm outgrower scheme, and no shortage of good candidates is expected.
All plantings would be on land for which the farmer has the right of usufruct.
Lo,cations and choice of planters would be strictly controlled by SODEPALM
procedures (para 4.04-4.05).
3.13      Oil palm holdings would be cleared by their owners.  Seedlings,
cover crop seed, fertilizer, and cash for hiring labor would be supplied to
the outgrower by SODEPALM. Development and maintenance methods employed
by outgrowers and SODEPALM control and supervision procedures have proved
successful and no changes are contemplated.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. General
4.01      The Bank was involved in the discussions that led to the creation
of the Participation and its constituent companies, and approved the corres-
ponding legal statutes. The Bank also approved the Participation's management
organization, with the provisos that a policy of "Ivorization" would be pursued



- 10 -
by SODEPALM/PALIIVOIRE, and that appointments to the key posts of General
Manager and Assistant General Manager of SODEPALM/PALMIVOIRE and the Credit
Manager of SODEPALM would be made only following agreement with the Bank. A
change in top management took place on January 1, 1974, when an Ivorian citizen
was appointed as Director General to replace the former expatriate incumbent.
He and his new Deputy, also an Ivor:tan, have held senior positions in SODEPALM;
both men are qualified to fill their new posts. SODEPALM/PALMIVOIRE intends
to retain the services of seven high level expatriate staff members. Conse-
quently all key managerial positions continue to be filled with qualified and
experienced persons.
Estates Management
4.02      SODEPALM estates are managed by PALMIVOIRE from headquarters in
Abidjan. Development of plantings at the existing Ehania and Dabou estates
would be supervised by the present estate management, and for Okrouyo super-
vision would be provided by the Soubre distrtct staff. These arrangements
are satisfactory.
Management of Outgrower Oil Palm Development
4.03      A Division of SODEPALM is responsible for oil palm outgrowers (para
2.11). Within this Division and at field level, area chiefs supervise outgrower
activity in nine principal areas, each covering a zone of about 20 km radius
from each mill. Below the area level, group chiefs appointed by SODEPALM
supervise plantings made individually by farmers who are grouped on a village
basis to facilitate supervision and the supply of technical and marketing
services. For each group, a SODEPALM employee coordinates and records the
collection of fresh fruit bunches to be delivered to the area's mill. About
half of project plantings probably would be made by farmers who have already
planted palms under the SODEPALM program. Because of this factor, and also
because more than half of outgrower palms are now in production and thus
require less supervision, carrying out the outgrower component would require
no increase in headquarters or area field staff.  The performance of the
SODEPALM outgrower program has been satisfactory and no organizational or
management problems are envisaged.
B. Outgrower Selection, Size of Holdings and Credit Arrangements
4.04      Participation in the outgrower scheme would continue to be conditional
on the farmer's agreement to follow, throughout the development period, the
technical advice provided by SODEPALM. Such an obligation has been contained
in the agreements that are signed between SODEPALM and outgrowers and which
have been approved by the Bank.
4.n5      The local SODEPALM agent inspects each applicant's farm, checks
his standing in the community and ability as a farmer, and makes a recommenda-
tion to headquarters. Existing selection arrangements would apply. Under



- 1 1 -
these, outgrower participants are limited to a maximum of 10 ha of oil palm.
The farmer's planting site must be within 200 m of a road passable by ffb
collection vehicles; and new outgrower planting sites would be in zones where
additional plantings could be handled by the existing supervision and ffb
collection services.
4.06      As under the ongoing program, outgrowers would receive both credits,
now interest free, and grants from SODEPALM (details in Annex 5). About CFAF
80,000/ha (US$320/ha) would be credit: CFAF 60,000 would be for field
establishment, specifically seedlings, fertilizer, and cash for land clearing
and maintenance of plantings, and CFAF 20,000 for fertilizer supply from
year 4 to year 7. This credit would be repayable in 9 years after a seven-
year grace period. Outgrowers would contract to sell all theit produce to
SODEPALM, which would deduct payments due from the sales price. About CFAF
16,700/ha (US$67/ha) would be a grant, comprising the cover crop, wire
netting, and labor costs related to supply of seedlings. This is much lower
than the CFAF 63,800 and CFAF 48,300 per hectare provided as grants, respectively,
under the first and second projects. A reduction in individual grant is now
possible because the experience with ongoing programs is demonstrating that
well planted and maintained oil palm can compete successfully with other crops
in the project area and therefore prospective participants would be less
reluctant to join the project than in earlier years. FER would continue to
reimburse SODEPALM for the grant element.
4.07      rhe system of financing oil palm out3rowers 1/ development in the
Ivory Coas: through nominally interest-free loans and grants cannot be judged
by the standards of a conventional credit system. The system is not intended
to replace or compete with a conventional system and is simply a financing
method chosen by Government to attain the dual objectives of: (a) providing
adequate incentive to farmers to diversify into oil palm, and (b) assuring
Government a satisfactory return on its own investment in the outgrowers
program and which has proved to be very successful. Recent studies show that
in conventional credit programs high interest rates have to be charged, up
to 25% and 30% in some cases, if the lending institution is to receive a
reasonable return on the money lent to farmers after due allowance for
administration and technical service charges and reserves against bad debts.
A scheme charging high interest rates would not have been condusive to
encouraging farmers to invest in a crop that was essentially new to them,
such as oil palm, and consequently of unproved merit. Under the SODEPALM
scheme, outgrowers must sell their produce to SODEPALM. The difference between
the forecast export price and the price paid to producers accrues to SODEPALM,
not to the outgr6wers, and the guiding principle in fixing the producer price
is consistency with a minimum financial return to Government of 7% on its oil
palm outgrower investment. On the basis of the average price paid for out-
growers ffb (CFAF 8/kg including bonuses) and the current world market price
forecast, the return to Government from this investment is estimated at 12%;
1/   A conventional credit system has been used for coconut outgrowers since
the inception of the coconut program.



- 12 -
and even if the producer price to outgrowers were increased by 50%, the re-
turn to Government would remain above the target return of 7%. Under the
market conditions prevailing during the early years of outgrowers development
(1969-71), it had been felt necessary to charge a 2% interest rate on loans to
outgrowers to secure the desired return to Government. With a greatly im-
proved mar;et outlook, SODEPALM suspended the interest charge in 1971, as it
was not neesded to insure a satisfactory return to Government. As the SODEPALM
scheme is achieving highly satisfactory results and is not, because of the
very specialized nature of the oil palm program, establishing undesirable
precedents, it is not considered necessary to make any change in the credit
arrangements for oil palm outgrowers.
C. Processing and Marketing
4.08      PALMINDUSTRIE would have sufficient capacity to process all ffb
production with its nine existing oil mill centers and some additional
capacity scheduled to be constructed at Ehania. PAIMINDUSTRIE would provide
the transport services to collect outgrower and estate fresh fruit bunches
(ffb).
4.09      Palm oil and kernels produced by the PALMINDUSTRIE mills would be
marketed by PALMIVOIRE, both directly and through contracts concluded with
the Belgian commodity trading company SOGESCOL as broker. These arrangements
are in force and are satisfactory.
V. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING
A. Cost Estimates
5.01      Project costs during the six-year period 1974 through 1979 are
estimated at CFAF 2.7 billion (US$10.8 million), of which the foreign exchange
component is about CFAF 1.3 billion (US$5.1 million) or 47%. Detailed cost
estimates are in Annex 6, and are summarized in the attached table (next page).
5.02      Government has indicated its intention to continue to exempt all
imports needed for the project from import duties during the development
period, and confirmation of this has been obtained. Such exemption would
negate all preferences enjoyed by foreign companies in the Ivory Coast market.
Cost estimates are based on February 1974 prices, and reflect the ample ex-
perience gained from the national oil palm program. Cost estimates include
indirect taxes amounting to about US$1 million, and contain the following
contingencies:

(a)  pnys_a   contingencies totalling about 10Z of project
cost are included for oil palm outgrowers and the estates; and
(b) price contingencies compounded as follows: for civil works,
construction, and mechanical land clearance, 18Z in 1974,
15? in 1975, 12X in 1976 and thereafter; and for all remaining
costs, 14% in 1974, 11Z in 1975, and 7.5? thereafter.
Total contingencies calculated on the foregoing basis amount to 26? of total
project costs or 35% of base line cost estimates.
B. Proposed Financing
5.03      Government has asked France's Caisse Centrale (CcCE) and the Bank
to cofinance part of project costs.  It is envisaged that together the Bank
and CCCE would-finance roughly the equivalent of the project's foreign
exchange costs. This would entail a Bank loan totalling US$2.6 million, equiv-
alent to 24% of total project costs and about 50% of estimated foreign exchange
costs.
5.04      The loan would be to SODEPALM/PALMIVOIRE, and would be disbursed
during the five-year period 1974-78. The term of the loan would be 15 years,
with a five-year grace period for principal payments. CCCE has agreed in prin-
ciple to lend an identical amount to SODEPALM/PALMIVOIRE, to be disbursed over
the same period as the IBRD loan. Tentatively, the CCCE loans would bear
interest at 5.5% and would be for the same term and grace period as on the
proposed Bank loan. The balance of project costs not covered by IBRD and CCCE
loans would be financed by SODEPALM from self-generated funds.
5.05      The financing plan for the proposed project is summarized below:
Financing Plan
Estates            Outgrowers         Total
US$000    X        US$ '000    x      US$ '000    %
IBRD                   2,600    29          -                2,600    24
OCCE                   2,600    29          -                2,600    24
Government:

C. Procurement and Disbursement
5.06      All contracts of over US$50,000 would be subject to international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. These would involve
procurement of goods and services estimated to cost US$1.4 million: fertilizer
and insecticides, US$0.5 million; vehicles and equipment, US$0.9 million.
Local manufacturers would be allowed a preference of up to 15% against bids
based on CIF prices. High yielding palm oil seed estimated to cost US$0.5
million would be supplied by IRHO, the only supplier of suitable material.
Civil works consisting of land clearing and earth estate roads, estimated to
cost US$2.7 million, would be carried out by force account. SODEPALM has the
equipment needed for this work and has demonstrated that it can conduct it
both more efficiently and less costly than can contractors; costs have averaged
50% less (para 3.07). Of remaining project costs, US$2.6 million would be
for staff and labor, US$0.3 million would be for materials to establish plant
nurseries, US$0.5 million would be for housing, and US$2.8 million would be
unallocated. Disbursement of Bank and CCCE loans would occur from loan
signature to the end of calendar 1978. For administrative convenience, the
Bank and CCCE would disburse pari passu, at 35% each, against the estates
component only. Disbursements (Annex 7) would be against contracts, completion
certificates and other documents certified by SODEPALM.
D. Accounts and Audit (Annex 2)
5.07      SODEPALM, with PALMIVOIRE assistance, would continue to maintain
accounts for both the oil palm outgrower program and estates. As a result of
consultations with the bank, SODEPALM has made improvements on the following
points concerning accounting and auditing:
Accounting System. SODEPALM's accounting system was deficient
(Annex 2), and a satisfactory review along lines agreed with
the Bank has been completed.
External Audit. The former external audit of SODEPALM/
PALMIVOIREfPALMINDUSTRIE proved inadequate because Ivorian
law is less exacting in this respect than international
auditing standards. Satisfactory arrangements for auditing
under international auditing practices have recently been
made.
Internal Audit.  To overcome the lack of an internal audit,
SODEPALM/PALMIVOIRE established this function under satisfactory
conditions. This would insure a better reliability of cost
and financial data issued by SODEPALM/PALMIVOIRE.

VI.  YIELDS, OUTPUT, MARKETS AND PRICES
A. Yields and Output
6.01      Oil palm outgrowers are estimated to obtain an average yield of 13
tons ffb/ha (21% oil and 4.3% kernel contents) when their oil palm plantings
are mature, nine years after planting. Actual results from existing oil palm
outgrowers confirm the validity of this estimate. Estates are expected to
obtain a range of yields depending upon their differing potentials (Annex 4),
specifically these are:  Ehania, 16 tons/ha; Okrouyo, 14 tons/ha; Dabou, 12
tons/ha, with oil yields of about 21.5Z and kernel yields of 4.3%.
6.02      Oil palms planted under the project would come into production
after four years and reach full production in the ninth year. Consequently,
project plantings would reach full production in 1984, from which time their
production would average 30,800 tons of oil and 6,300 tons of kernels annually
or less than 1% of the anticipated world trade in these commodities at that
time (Annex 8).
B. Markets and Pricep
6.03      Market prospects are good.  About 55X of the palm oil and all
kernels produced by project plantings would be exported, and the remaining
45% would be absorbed by the growing domestic market. Total world production
of palm oil is estimated to be expanding at about 12% annually, and production
by 1980 is expected to reach about 4.2 million tons and exports 2.7 million
tons. Of the total, the Ivory Coast would export about 110,000 tons or 4.5%.
On the basis of the supply and demand outlook, the Bank's commodity analysts
expect palm oil prices to range from US$425/ton, the current price, to US$695/
ton cif Europe in 1985. A price equivalent to US$327/ton cif Europe, in
constant 1974 prices, has been assumed for project purposes (Annex 8).
6.04      The principal product of palm kernels is palm kernel oil, which
has similar chemical characteristics to coconut oil; on the basis of the
trend in coconut prices, palm kernel prices in current terms are expected
to range from US$350/ton, the present level, to US$460/ton cif Europe by
1935. A price of US$218/ton, in constant 1974 prices, has been assumed
for project purposes. The price projections for both oil palm products
compare favorably with the outlook under the previous projects.

VII. FINANCIAL BENEFITS AND OUTLOOK
Financial Results
7.01      Whilst production from the first project has been generally in line
with appraisal estimates, the financial results of the Participation have
been better than expected because of higher than expected palm oil prices,
which averaged over US$215/ton in 1972 and US$400/ton in 1973, compared with
the projected figure of US$160/ton, and which have more than offset cost in-
creases. The financial results of the smallholder program have been in line
with estimates. The operating results for 1972, before debt service, may
be summarized as follows:
Smallholder

Actual results                       156            315          (159)
7.02      SODEPALM's working capital was severely depleted by the end of 1972,
when Bank overdrafts amounted to CPAP 1.6 billion, due to investments outside
the scope of the original program (para 2.19). By the end of 1973, however,
increased revenues and additional long term borrowing from PER had reduced
the overdraft to an estimated CFAF 900 million.
7.03      The estimated cash flows for the period 1973-1988 for SODEPALM and
PALMINDUSTRIE are at Annex 2, Table 8; they are based on the latest (April 9)
price forecasts for palm oil. For SODEPALM they show the following main
flows of funds up to the end of disbursements, in 1978, under the proposed
project:

housing.
Project Benefits - The Participation 
7.04      The main benefits to the Participation would accrue from the output
of the estate plantings (Annex 10), from small reductions in estate and proces-
sing overheads and costs due to economies in scale resulting from project
actions. The benefits would be allocated to SODEPALM, PALMINDUSTRIE and
PALMIVOIRE in proportion to their investments. Surpluses would begin to
accumulate in 1979 and by 1985, at full development, would amount after debt
service to an estimated CPA? 380 million (US$1.5 million), or 20% of the
Participation's total earnings. At that time, net earnings would be allocated
60% to SODEPALM, 39% to PALMINDUSTRIE and 1% to PALMIVOIRE.
7.05      SODEPALM would also benefit directly from the services it provides
the additional smallholders (Annex 5). At full development in 1985, incremental
iurpluses from this source would amount to CFAP 184 million (US$0.7 million),
or 45% of the total surpluses accruing to SOEPALM's outgrower service
division (Annex 10, Table 2). In other words, due to economies of scale in
servicing additional outgrowers with the same staff, the 5,000 ha of project
plantings will produce almost as much surplus as the previous 25,00b ha of
outgrower plantings.



- 19 -
Project Benefits - Oil Palm Outgrowers
7.06      For outgrowers, average returns from the ongoing projects are
about CFAF 860/manday employed after all costs including debt service, as
compared with estimates made at appraisal of the second project in 1971 of
CFAF 612. Expected benefits for outgrowers ander the project have been
estimated from models prepared from the experience of previous projects.
Under current practice SODEPALM pays outgrowers a fixed basic price of
CFAF 4/kg ffb, augmented by a bonus system that enabled growers to attain,
in 1973, an average price of CFAF 6/kg ffb. The expected 1974 average price
to outgrowers is CFAF 8/kg ffb; financial projections (para 4.07) show that
this price is consistent with adequate return to Government. Production on
an outgrower's holding would begin in the fourth year after planting, when
39 working days would be required to maintain and harvest one hectare of oil
palms and when the return per manday would be CFAF 86 (USd0.34). This would
increase and reach a maximum of CFAF 2,000 after debt service by year 9 and
CFAF 2,200 (US$8.8) when debt service is completed in year 16. The return to
labor employed is satisfactory compared with the official agricultural wage
of CFAF 315/day (including fringe benefits) and with the return from cocoa
cultivation, another principal crop in the oil palm zone, of about CFAF
940 (US$3.75) per manday from traditional plantings and CFAF 1,200 from
improved plantings. Few outgrowers cultivate only oil palm, as most combine
oil palms with coffee and food crops. Indications are that the average
outgrower holding will be about 4 ha and plantings of this size would generate
a t:otal annual income after debt service of approximately CFAF 480,000
(US$1,920) as from year 16 after full repayment of debt. The returns are
considered satisfactory from the viewpoints of inducing farmers to participate
in the outgrower program, and of improving their standards of living.
VIII, ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      Primary benefits from the oil palm outgrower and estate plantings
would be the increased production of palm oil and kernels and resultant net
annual incremental foreign exchange earnings amounting to about US$8.8 million
by 1987.
8.02      Based on expected world prices for these commodities, the returns
to the ecoriomy from the project investments are estimated to be about 23%.
In calculating this overall rate, all labor used in the project, for small-
holder as well as estate development, has been costed at the average official
rate of CFAF 315/manday including fringe benefits. The rate of return for
the estate component is estimated at 20%, and the rate for the outgrower
component at 35%. The difference between the two rates is greater than it
was under the previous project; the reason is that outgrower development
under the new project would utilize infrastructure and services already in-
stalled during earlier projects. The resultilLg higher rate of return on
outgrower development might suggest that this co"ponent of the project should
be expanded. However, the proposed pace of development is based on SODEPALM's



- 20 -
judgment as to how fast additional outgrower plantings could be integrated
into the program. Under Loan IVC-613, it was envisaged that 12,000 ha would
be developed by smallholders over a four year period but the development
period subsequently had to be extended by two years. The proposed program
is in keeping with that experience. Details of the calculation are given
at Annex 12, which includes an analysis of the sensitivity of the rates of
return to changes in costs and benefits. As is often the case with slowly
maturing investments, the rates of return for all project components are
relatively insensitive to changes in the value of output/ha, itself a function
of both yields and prices:
Returns (a)
Output/ha          90%       110%
Outgrowers         32%        36%
Estates            17%        23%
8.03      The project would have substantial secondary benefits through
providing employment for some 600 workers on the oil palm estates, and creat-
ing some 265,000 mandays of work per year in developing outgrowers' holdings.
The project would further the Government's program of agricultural diversi-
fication both directly, through the project output, and indirectly by generat-
ing the resources with which to pursue other programs.
IX. RECOMME9NDATIONS
9.01      The assurances and covenants of Loans IVC-611, IVC-613 and IVC-760
would be continued, insofar as they are applicable, in the Third Oil Palm
Loan.  In addition, assurances have been obtained on the following points:
(a)  Government would submit to the Bank, within 12 months
after loan effectiveness, a plan to process and market
coconut production (para 2.18); and
(b) facilities and title to or rights in respect of land
required for the carrying out and operation of the
project would be provided to SODEPALM within one year
of loan effectiveness (para 3.11).
9.02      Subject to the above conditions, the project is suitable for a Bank
loan to SODEPALM/PALMIVOIRE for US$2.6 million repayable over 10 years after
five years of grace on principal payments.

IVORY COAST
THIRD OIL PALM PROJECT
Progress of Agricultural Projects Financed by Bank Loans
A.   Loan 611-IVC - Palmivoire US$3.3 Million Equivalent (June 13, 1969)
1.        The project consists of establishing and bringing into production
4,000 ha of oil palms at Ehania estate and to bring the estate to 10,000 ha
of oil palms. The loan became effective on December 30, 1969. Planting was
completed in 1972 and plantation maintenance is satisfactory. Planting costs
were slightly lower than estimated at the time of appraisal.
B.   Loan 612-IVC - Palmindustrie US$4.8 Million Equivalent (June 13, 1969)
2.        The project comprises the construction of a palm oil mill to service
the 10,000 ha Ehania estate and some outgrowers. The loan became effective
on December 30, 1969. The mill was constructed with an initial capacity of
40 tons/hour ffb, in two processing lines, and these are functioning satis-
factorily at full capacity. Costs were within appraisal estimates. An
addition of a 20-ton/hr processing line was provided for in the project, but
Palmindustrie has requested the Bank to approve a change in plans involving
two satellite mills of 20 tons/hr each with expanded central mill service,
instead of the addition. The proposal is sound and therefore the project
description will be changed to delete the third processing line, and the
remaining funds ($700,000) will be devoted to help finance the proposed
satellite-central mill complex.
C.   Loan 613-IVC - Sodepalm US$9.0 Million Equivalent (June 13, 1969)
3.        The project consists of the establishment and bringing into produc-
tion of 12,000 ha of outgrower oil palms, the establishment and maintenance
until 1974 of 3,500 ha of estate coconuts and 3,000 ha of outgrower coconuts,
the provision of credit and supervisory services for oil palm and coconut
outgrowers and the necessary infrastructure associated with the 3,500 ha of
estate coconuts. The loan became effective on December 30, 1969. Project
coconut estate plantings were due to be completed in 1971.  Due to shortage
of planting material (because of disease), the Bank agreed to extend the
planting period to 1972. All estate plantings have now been completed. At
the request of the Borrower, the Bank also agreed to the extension of the oil
palm outgrower program planting period, initially scheduled to be completed
in 1970, to 1972 to permit more rigorous selection of outgrowers.
4.        The above three loans are the first Bank operations in support of
the oil palm sector in the Ivory Coast. After a relatively slow start dis-
bursements of the Bank have accelereated and are now well within appraisal

estimates. On the other hand, physical progress has been very good. Although
production of the oil palms under the project is just beginning, all indica-
tions are that yields in the estates and of outgrowers will be in line with
appraisal estimates. The number of outgrowers participating in the project
is also in line with appraisal estimates.
D.   Loan 686-IVC - Cocoa Project US$7.5 Million Equivalent (June 5, 1970)
5.        The project originally consisted of the planting of 18,800 ha of
cocoa and the rehabilitation of about 38,000 ha of existing cocoa plantations
and became effective in November 1970. The project was amended in July 1973
to reduce the rehabilitation ccmponent to 15,500 ha. This revised program
has been completed. Approximately 10,000 ha had been established under the
new planting program by the end of 1973; plantings of 7,800 ha are expected
in 1974 and 1,000 ha in 1975, completing the program one year later than
expected at appraisal. Disbursements have been delayed by a delay in signing
annual operating conventions, between Government and SATMACI, but with the
processing of outstanding commitments disbursements are expected to reach
US$3 million in early 1974, or about 25% below appraisal estimates. The
Bank's share of project costs have been reduced by the reduction of rehabilita-
tion and fertilizer programs (evidence has accumulated that, with increased
prices, payoff from fertilizer use on new plantations is not adequate).
E.   Loans 759-IVC and 760-IVC - Sodepalm and Palmindustrie US$7.0 Million
Equivalent (June 22, 1971)
6.        The project consists of (a) planting 4,500 ha outgrower oil palms,
(b) 4,500 ha of outgrower coconut palms, (c) 8,000 ha of coconut palms on
Government-owned estates, and (d) construction of a palm oil mill. The loans
became effective on November 15, 1972. The oil mill was commissioned in
July 1972, and is operating satisfactorily.  The planting programs are pro-
ceeding satisfactorily and on schedule.
F.   Loan 938-IVC-SOCATCI Rubber Estate US$8.4 Million Equivalent
(October 23, 1973)
7.        This loan was signed in October 1973, but the deadline for
meeting conditions of effectiveness was postponed from November 30, 1973,
the original date, to April 30, 1974. The purpose of the loan is to finance,
pari passu with CCCE and FED, the planting of 13,500 ha of modern rubber
estates and the establishment of auxiliary services under the management of
".EtablissementsMichelin", a French tire manufacturer.

IVORY COAST
THIRD OIL PALM PROJECT
SODEPALM Accounts and Financing
Accounting
1.        Accounting procedures were changed in 1969 to fit with the new
legal structure of the participation, and, in 1972, to meet legal require-
ments when Ivory Coast adopted a national accounting chart.
2.        These requirements, added to a fast development of the group's
activities, caused the accounting procedures to be in a state of transition
for too long a time. As a result, the accounting system has not met the
requirements. While SODEPALM has been mostly interested in obtaining reliable
production costs quickly, it has neglected to produce detailed investment
costs.  This situation is now improving and SODEPALM has reconciled    most
of its accounts with physical inventories; this work is expected to be com-
pleted in 1974.
3.        SODEPALM has reviewed its accounting procedures and is training its
Ivorian accounting staff as recommended by the Bank. The Bank has been kept
informed of the progress of this review which is expected to enable SODEPALM
to improve and simplify its accounting procedures.
Auditing
4.        Two auditors are appointed by the Minister of Economic Affairs and
Finance (actually, only one is from the Government Audit Department; the
other is from a private firm of auditors, Societe Fiduciaire France-Afrique).
Accounts remain provisional until approved by the Minister and submitted
to the General Assembly together with an annual report. This must be within
three months of the end of each fiscal year.
5.        This auditing has not been satisfactory under present arrangements
because the Ivorian law is less exacting in this respect than international
auditing standards. The important internal audit function has been lacking.
SODEPALM/PALMIVoIRE has made satisfactory arrangements in both of these
matters.
Balance Sheets and Long-Term Forecasts
6.        Tables 1 and 2 summarize balance sheets for SODEPALM and PALMINDUSTRIE.
7.        Tables 3 to 8 summarize the long-term financing plan.  They show
that oil palm activities will generate abundant surpluses on the basis of
current estimates. Nevertheless, from these surpluses SODEPALM will have to
finance about CFAF 3.1 billion of deficits for the coconut sector, instead
of CFAF 1.5 billion as anticipated at appraisal.

THIRD OIL PALM PROJECT
Technical Features
Planting Program
1.        The combined estate and outgrower planting targets are given in
Table 1.
Planting Material
2.        The Institut de Recherche pour les Huiles et Oleagineux (IRHO), a
French plant research institution, has its main oil palm research station
at La Me in the Ivory Coast, and maintains two experimental plantations in the
project area. Most of the project plantings will be seedlings of E. Guineensis
dura x pisifera, which is the same basic species used in both previous Bank
projects. However, the yield potential has been greatly improved since the
first project, througi the yearly selection of lines.  Oil palm seeds are
provided by IRHO under contract, and the existing plantations are capable of
providing seed to plant over 12,000 ha per year. IRHO also provides technical
supervision of the SODEPALM nurseries, where seedlings are raised under shade
in prepared plastic bags. It should be noted that the varieties replanted at
Dabou Estate in the savannah would be chosen by IRHO for resistance to
fusarium. IRHO has been selecting and improving such varieties since 1965.
Fusarium disease is, in fact, fairly common in replantations of palm on palm.
In view of the results obtained by IRHO on its own replantings, the varieties
now used should not cause undue risk.
3.        Of the 1,600 ha scheduled under the project for Ehania estate, 400 ha
would be the first commercial plantation of a new hybrid variety, a cross
between the African palm, Elaeis Guineenis and the Anerican palm, Elaeis
Nlelanococca. The new hybrid has been under development by IRHO since the
mid-1960's, and test plantings have been observed to maturity. The results
are promising enough for IRHO to launch a variety trials program. The Ehania
plantings would be in support of this program.
4.        E. Melanococca became of interest to IRHO because of several
characteristics:
(a) its oil is rich in unsaturated fatty acids - a trait desirable
for human consumption that is a deficient quality of the
African palm. Its oil is also fluid;
(b)  it has demonstrated resistance to two American diseases,
Polesis Root Rot and Heart Rot. Outside of its native
habitat, it has also shown resistance tofusarium   in
Africa and to ganoderma in the Far East;



ANlNEX 4
Page 2
(c) its vertical growth is slower than the African palm, a
trait that allows easier exploitation over a longer
period than E. Guineensis; and
(d) it crosses easily with E. Guineensis to form hybrids.
5.        Spontaneous stands of E. Melanococca in Central and South America
exhibited a short stem of 3-4 m, a floral biology similar to the African oil
palm, and fresh fruit bunches (ffb) that bore orange-red or yellow fruit of
wlhich a high proportion was parthenocarpic (nonfertilized). Only the dura
variety has been identified. To collect promising sire strains for hybridiza-
tion with E. Guineensis, IHRO prospected the known stands of E. Melanococca
in Colombia, Brazil, Surinam, Panama and Costa Rica.
6.        Hybrid plantings began in 1968.  Various lines of E. Melanococca
were tried with various origins of E. Guineensis pisifera under observation
for five years, i.e., into the productive phase. These plantings generally
show:
(a) Trecocity, as compared to E. Guineensis
(b) excellent crown development
(c) slower vertical growth of the stem.
7.        Comparative results in terms of ffb characteristics, against the
production variety E. Guineensis (tenera), indicate the hybrid E. Melanococca
(dura) X E. Guineensis (pisifera) produces a slightly inferior quantity of
fruit per bunch, and its oil extraction rate is also slightly inferior. But
a high proportion of nonfertilized fruit increases the quantity of the oil
produced. The hybrid contains a greater amount of nonsaturated fatty acids.
The hybrid palm oil is also entirely fluid at normal temperatures which
overcomes a serious deficiency of the African palm oil, which contains a
large proportion of concrete oil. The African oil thus has to be heated
for transport, and for table use the concrete oils have to be separated and
extracted. The quality of the new hybrid palm oil is very near to olive oil.
At the present state of knowledge, it appears the hybrid would yield less
oil (about 17% extraction rate to date versus the 21% or more presently being
achieved in the Ivory Coast) but which would bring higher prices due to
quality factors.
8.        The hybrid tree also promises greater resistance to various diseases,
and slower growth of stem which would lengthen the exploitation period.
9.        To determine the magnitude of future industrial plantings with this
new planting material, further tests are necessary. IRHO has embarked on a
variety trials program that will pursue the results of combining other strains
of E. Melanococca, the selection of particular hybrid lines, backcrosses,
etc. In the meantime, it is also important to begin small scale tests of
the best available seed material under commercial plantation conditions.

Rationale of the Estate Plantings
10.       Dabou.  The Dabou Savanniah Plantation (PSD) covers an area of
1,950 ha belonging to the Republic of the Ivory Coast, and since July 1972
has been under the management of SODEPALM. Ownership is being transferred
to SODEPALM.
11.       This plantation was virtually the first industrial oil palm venture
in the Ivory Coast. The first lots were planted in 1952 by the Agricultural
Services, and during the years to 1964 the total area was extended to 1,950 ha.
Subsequently, between 1965 and 1968, SODEPALM planted a supplementary 1,416 ha
on its periphery, giving a total of 3,366 ha of industrial plantations. (In
addition there are more than 4,500 ha of village plantations in the area).
12.       Almost all of the Dabou savannah area is now exploited.  Land
suitable for planting is uncommon (IRHO plantations and the SAPH rubber
plantation are also in the area). Most of the post-1958 plantations are
under the higher yielding seedlings. However, there are previous plantations
covering 920 ha that are under traditional varieties (Dura x Dura and Dura x
Tenera) which yield no more than an average of 6 tons/ffb/ha (4 to 7 tons
according to lot). The extraction rate is 12% for oil and 5% for kernels.
13.       In June 1973, the new Savannah Dabou oil mill, owned by PALMINDUSTRIE
and financed under the second project, began operations in the area. Since
the new mill would be able to handle the higher production made possible by
replanting with new seedlings, the proposed project component has been
assigned high priority.
14.       Okrouyo.  Within the framework of the general study carried out by
IRHO in 1967-68 on the "Possibilities of Oil Palm Development in the Ivory
Coast", the Soubre-Gueyo region appeared particularly interesting and was
studied in detail.
15.       These studies led to choosing a 4,595 ha perimeter for development,
17 km notheeast of the Soubre oil mill. The decision to proceed is based on
the existence of excess capacity at the Soubre mill. This mill has a theor-
etical capacity of 132,000 tons (40 tons ffb/hour), but is now supplied by
only 72,000 tons, i.e. 55% of its theoretical capacity. This small supply
causes a milling cost that is about 60% above the average cost of other
SODEPALM mills.
16.       The proposed project would finance plantings of 1,500 ha in 1975
and 1,500 ha in 1976. The expected output would supply the mill at Soubre
with an additional 42,000 tons of ffb, increasing supply to 86% of theoretical
capacity.
17.       The cost of setting up the Okrouyo unit, in a granitic zone, will
be higher than for plantings on tertiary sands. Collection will also be
higher because of the necessity of transporting the ffb over 17 km to the
mill at Soubre. But the availability of the otherwise underutilized capacity
at the Soubre mill justifies the high priority given to these plantings.

18.       Ehania.  The Ehania district, in the eastern sector near Ghana
border, is one of the most favored sites for oil palm identified in the
original reconnaisance surveys. It therefore benefitted from detailed
topographic and soil surveys which resulted in the exclusion of all unsuit-
able land. TJnder the first Bank project, the estate was expanded by 4,000 ha
to a total of about 10,400 ha, which was considered the completion of the es-
tat:e unit as planned. (Outgrower plantings in the district were raised under
the second project from approximately 1,700 ha to 2,200 ha, thus making a
total of some 12,600 ha in the district).
19.       However, within the perimeter granted by the Republic of the Ivory
Coast to SODEPALM for Ehania palm plantations, there remains 1,600 ha of
available land on the northeast boundary of the existing block. The avail-
ability of this land in the highest yielding district influenced the decision
to build additional processing capacity, and to build a satellite mill in con-
junction with the estate plantings. The proposed project would finance plant-
ings of 1,100 ha in 1974 and 500 ha in 1975.
Production Data
20.      <'elds.  For the project estates, Ehmnia area has excellent tertiary
sandy soil<, a good rainfall pattern, and is expected to be capable of pro-
ducing 18 tons/ha; but a more conservative 16 tons/ha has been used in projec-
tions. The advance over the first appraisal estimate is striking: five years
ago, capability was estimated at 16 tons/ha, and 15 tons/ha was used as a
conservative base. The Dabou estate is in a savannah area which, for techni-
cal reasons, supports much lower yields than exforest land. The capability
is judged to be 13 tons/ha, with 12 tons/ha being used for projections.
Okrouyo is in an area of medium productive granite soil, with average good
rainfall, and might be capable of producing 15 tons/ha; 14 tons/ha has been
used in the projections.
21.       The yields above generally indicate the range of possible yields
with new plantings in the oil palm region. Older plantings are producing
at much lower levels, of course. There is no agronomic reason why an out-
grower should not achieve estate yield levels - in fact some in the Ehania
district are matching the high estate yield. But outgrowers are able to have
a much wider range of yields (many of the farmers also tend crops such as
coffee and food). Since SODEPALM has recently tightened its selection stand-
ards, and its supervising program is now well tested, the project outgrowers
should give a good performance. However, a conservative average of 12 tons/ha
has been used in projections. Projected yield levels are detailed in Table 2.
22.       It should be mentioned that a substantial number of smallholders
are outside SODEPALM's "statistical net". Of the 25,000 ha of outgrower oil
palm, many of the older plantings are near urban areas, such as Abidjan, and
such farmers naturally prefer the higher prices that fresh fruit brings on
the private market. It is estimated that, overall, SODEPALM now receives
about 80% of total smallholder production, but this percentage should increase
as the proportion of plantings in outlying districts increases (there are no
private sales from Ehania smallholders, for instance).

23.       Fertilizer.  Foliar analys sa, to establish yearly nutrient standards
by growing area, is provided by IRHO, as part of its technical service, from
its central laboratory in Paris. SODEPALM effects dosage control on a block
basis. There has been no significant change in the fertilizer regime. Potash
is the most important element in the mixed formula; on some estates, some
additional boron has proved beneficial. Consumption of fertilizer under
SODEPALM's program reached 8,069 tons in 1973 (including coconuts).
24.       Processing Quality.  The nine existing mills are probably the most
modern in the world, and incorporate improvements developed by the research
service.  Palm oil with the high technical standard of 2.5% acidity or less
is produced, against the general market allowance of 5%. The high quality
of the product is related to the efficiency of collection and processing.
As a result, premium prices are commanded: say 106-107, assuming a market
incex of 100. Each factory has a local control laboratory, and there is a
central laboratory at Abidjan Terminal. The technical services have a tangible
record of achievement, and research programs under way should lead to further
progress in processing efficiency, product quality, and end product use.
25.       Pest Control.  Advice is provided by IRHO.  A minor threat to oil
palm is a beetle (oryctes) which is visible in various stages of development.
Current method of control is to pay children a bounty. The beetle is a mach
more serious threat to coconut than to oil palm, because it multiplies in
the softer woods left by land clearance along the littoral, but not in the
hardwoods left in forest areas.
26.       Cover Crop and Maintenance. Pueraria has been used as a cover
crop from the beginning, and provides satisfactory control of vegetative
regrowth and of Oryetes multiplication. Maintenance is a hand operation
for the young trees, then coupled with chemical spraying when the trees reach
adulthood; the objective during the establishment period is to provide each
tree with a noncompetitive growing area.
27.       Spacing.  The recommended regime remains the same.  Rows are stag-
gered to give a triangular spacing of 9 m between trees - 143 trees/ha.
The Special Problems at Dabou Estate
28.       The Estate replantings at Dabou Savannah Plantation would involve
a special regime development by IRHO, which since 1967 has been systematically
replanting its Mopoyem plantation in the same area (some 360 ha had been re-
planted by the end of 1973). The method used, related to the mechanized land
preparation practices followed for all Savannah plantations, is now clearly
defined. The special problem is to get rid of the imperata. It consists
basically of:
(a) one furrow 40 cm deep by means of a disc plow (1.20 m wide),
covering the entire interlines;



ANNEX 4
Page 6
(b) one deep cross harrowing, with a cover crop 2.80 m wide.
The ground is left for 10 to 15 days between the two
harrows, allowing the isperata to grow again. The regrowth
iL then torn out during the second harrowing;
(c) 10 to 12 shallow harrowing. (at maziusm) at 10 to 15-day
intervals to kill the imperata. When there are no more
signs of imperata, Pueraria (cover crop) is sown at the
same time as the final harrowing;
(d) the palm trees are then uprooted in lines with caterpillar
equipment 'and formed into windrows; and
(a) once the cover crop has completely grown over the palm
trunks, new planting can commence. The windrow must be
covered to prevent any danger from Oryctes infection.
It takes about eight montbh for the covering process to
be completed.
29.       Assuming that planting were to start in May 1975, the trew would
have to be felled in October 1974. Taking into account the time interval
between the various preparatory operations, the first plowing was carried
out during the third quarter of 1973.

2.        Total development cost is estimated at CFAF 76,710/ha as compared
to CFAF 117,220 and CPAF 102,050 for the two previous projects (Loan 613 and
760 IVC). This saving results from an economy of scale, since the proposed
project does not require any expansion of the existing infrastructure and
supervision staff.
3.        Outgrowers would clear the land, supply necessary tools at an
estimated cost of CFAF 150/ha/year as from year 0, and supply labor for
unkeep and harvest.
4.        During the operating period, SODEPALM would supply fertilizers at
an average rate of CFAF 5,000/ha/year, depending upon the result of foliar
analysis, and would organize and maintain collection service. The fertilizer
credit would begin in year 4, and extend through year 7, in line with the
current technical recommendation. Cash credit would remain at CFAF 20,000/ha
and credit in kind would increase from CFAF 33,750/ha to CFAF 40,000/ha.
5.        The Ponds d'Extension et de Renouvellesent (PER) would reimburse
SODEPALM CFAF 16,710/ha, which is the difference between the total cost of
establishing 1 ha (ClAF 76,710) and the amount repaid by farmers (CPFA 60,000).
FER's payment under the first project was CFAF 63,800/ha and CPA? 48,300
under the second.
6.        Farmers would now repay CFAF 80,000 from year 7 to year 15 intead
of CFAF 78,000 from year 7 to year 17. As a whole, the total subsidy per
hectare is now reduced to CFAF 16,710 instead of CPAW 39,220 for the first
project and CPAF 35,000 for the second one.
Allocation of Proceeds
7.        Up to 1972, farmers received a guaranteed net price of CFAF 4/kilo
of fresh fruit bunch (ffb) delivered to the district oil mill regardless of
the actual price received by SODEPALM for oil palm products. Early in 1973,
SODEPALM implemented a bonus system with two objectives: to give a price
incentive to outgrowers who delivered more fruits than expected to the oil
mills; and to allow outgrowers to participate in the revenues accruing to
SODEPALM. This bonus system avoided a flat increase of the fixed price of



ANNEX 5
Page 3
CFAF 4/kg of ffb. Also, SODEPALM expected that outgrowers production would be
increased by 102 above current estimates over the next five yars.
8.        The following table shows the estimated annual average allocation
of the value of one kilo of ffb, as of 19810, using the IBRD Porecast of palm
produce prices:

/1   Revenue less reference price established by SODEPALM.
9.        The surplus kept by SODEPALM ensures that Government will receive
an adequate return from its investments in the oil palm sector. Another
justification for not allocating this surplus to outgrovers is that SODEPALI
needs to build up a reasonable reserve fund to guarantee a minimlum price to
outgrowers, since the Stabilization Fund does not guarantee any minimum price
to farmers.

THIRD OIL PALM PROJECT
Market and Price Outlook for Palm Oil 1/
1.        The world supply of palm oil increased very rapidly in recent years
following a long period of slow growth. From 1950-52 to 1967-69 world pro-
duction rose at an annual average rate of 1.2%, while from 1967-69 the annual
growth rate has averaged more than 12%. World exports of palm oil, which
also practically stagnated throughout the 1950's and early 1960's, began to
increase at a 15% rate after 1967-69. By 1972 the share of palm oil in
export:s of all fats and oils had nearly reached the level of the early 1950's.
2.        World production of palm oil is expected to increase rapidly as
new plantings of high-yielding varieties reach maturity. Oil palm projects
financed by the Bank Group will contribute 15-16% to the total increase in
production during the decade from 1970 to 1980. Although the share of the
output consumed domestically in producing developing countries will decline,
total consumption of palm oil is expected to grow more rapidly in the 1970's
than in the 1960's.
3.        The demand for palm oil is largely influenced by the demand for all
oils and fats and for vegetable oils as a group. Total estimated consumption
of fats and oils expanded steadify at a trend rate of 2.9% from 1960 to 1970,
but both the geographic and the product composition of demand changed during
this period. Consumption in developed and developing countries rose at a
trend rate of 3.2%, while the trend rate of growth reached only 1.8% in
centrally planned economies. Developed countries, which represent the main
export market for fats and oils produced in LDC's, accounted for half of the
total world consumption in 1970. Demand for palm oil increased most rapidly
in Oceania, Japan and South Africa combined (7.0% per annum), followed by
Western Europe (3.0%) and the United States and Canada (2.6%). Among the
developing regions, Latin America had the greatest rate of growth in consump-
tion (4.3%) followed by Africa and Asia.
4.        The past decade saw a significant change away from animal fats
and oils towards vegetable oils. Consumption of animal fats and marine oils
increased at a rate far below that for vegetable oils. Within the vegetable
oils, the composition of demand changed in response to availabilities and
to a number of economic and noneconomic factors affecting the use of oils.
5.        The shift of demand away from animal fats and oils and to vegetable
oils is expected to continue. This will strenghthen the markets for vegetable
oils as a group. Increasing interchangeability among these oils will tend to
reduce price differences in the long run. In the short run, however, prices

stili reflec, relative availabi'lities of individual oils.  According to
Bar. staff project;ions, wori-d demand for all fats and oils at 1972 prices
vill rise to 56 million tors in 1980. This is 31.5% more than in 1970
(42.6 million tons) and represents a somewhat slower rate of increase than
in the preceding decade (33.1%'). World consumption of vegetable oils in
,980 is expected to reach about 39 million tons (69.5% of the total), an
increase of 41% over )970.
6.        During the past decade world production of animal fats and marine
o-.s has increased more slowly compared to the output of vegetable oils.
Within the group of vegetable oilsj, soybean oil, palm oil, rapeseed oil and
suaflowerseed oil showed steepest increases. On the basis of past production
treuds, world supply of all fats and oils combined in 1980 is expected to be
roughly in balance with world demand at the level of 56 million tons oil or
fat equivalent. This in turn implies that increased supplies of fats and
oils will be absorbed in the market without any persistent downward pressure
on the prices of these commodities as a group.
7.        On the basis of present e£timates of future output of the different
commodities involved, it seems cleat that palm oil will account for a larger
increase in world demand for vegetable oils than in the 1960-1970 decade.
Total demand for palm oil is expected to reach 4,130 thousand tons in 1980
compared with 2,078 thousand tons in 1971. Slightly more than half of this
quantity will be absorbed by developed countries, compared to 42% in 1971
and 35% in 1967.  Total output of ,alm oil is projected to reach between
4,080 and 4,230 thousand metric tons (depending on alternative production
forecasts for Malaysia). Exports will range between 2,560 and 2,710 thousand
metric tons.  This corresponds to about 64% of the total production compared
to 46% in 1971 and 49% in the period 1967-69. Malaysia will dominate exports,
followed by Indonesia; the Ivory Coast and Zaire will be the only important
exporters in West Africa. The share of LDC's in total consumption will fall
from 57% in 1971 to 48% in 1980, but the share of intra-LDC trade in total
exports will increase from 10 to 18% (low output assumption).
8.        The following factors will affect the future price of palm oil.
World consumption of palm oil is projected at 4,130 thousand metric tons in
1980; 1,520 metric tons will be consumed domestically in producing countries.
This leaves a total import requirement of 2,610 thousand metric tons, of which
14% would come from nonproducing developing countries, and 4% from Nigeria,
which will become a net Importer of palm oil in the amount of 100,000 metric
tons. Output is projected to reach between 4,080 and 4,230 thousand metric
tons, depending on developments in Malaysia. The 150,000 ton supplement in
the higher projection for Malaysia is expected to find its way into exports,
giving alternative world export figures of 2,560 to 2,710 thousand tons. The
projected difference between import demand and export supply is small and all
the more so given the expected overall balance between demand and supply of
all fats and oils and of vegetable oils. The price for palm oil is projected
at US$300 in 1980 and US$327 in 1985 per metric ton (in 1974 constant dollars).
This price forecast assumes that general inflationary tendencies will not be



ANEX 8
Page 3
reflected in the future price for palm oil and, as a result, the purchasing
po er of palm oil exports is likely to be reduced by a corresponding amount,
particularly if export prices of developed countries do follow the expected
geueral Inflationary trend. If the relatively high rate of inflation (7.3%
for the period 1974-80) is taken into consideration in the price projection,
the price for palm oil will amount to about US$477 per metric ton in 1980
and US$695 in 1985 (current terms).
9.        Table 1 contains monthly prices for palm oil (Malayan, bulk 5%
cif European ports) for the period from 1967 to 1973. These figures illustrate
the dramatic increase in palm oil prices in more recent years. From 1967 to
1973 annual average prices climbed at a rate of 10.9% - well above the aver-
age rate of inflation in develop"d countries.

THIRD OIL PALM PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return Calculation
Assumptions
1.        Life of the Project and Phaslng.  The life of the project has been
assumed to be 25 years, which corresponds to the expected economic life of
oil palm trees planted under the project. The phasing of the project is
shown in Annex 4.
2.        Yields.  Expected yields of estate plantations and outgrowers are
in Annex 4. These yields reflect the experience in Ivory Coast with similar
estate plantations and outgrovers.
3.        Prices.  Output prices are the ex-harbor expected prices of palm
oil and kernels expressed in 1974 constant prices. These prices are based
on the projections to 1985 of the IBRD's Economic Analysis and Projections
Department which are discussed in detail in Annex 8. The detail of the conver-
sion from CIT projected prices into ex-harbor is in Table 1.
4.        Costs.  Costs take into consideration on-farm development cost
and additional investment in processing and transport facilities as well as
recurrent expenditures related to processing and transporting of project
output over the life of the project. Input prices have been updated to
the level of the first quarter of 1974, with due allowance for cost increases
for transport, insecticides and fertilizers. Identifiable taxes have been
deducted from costs. Labor has been costed at the minimum legal wage of CFA 315
per day (including fringe benefits).
5.        Foreign Exchange.  The value of exported project output and im-
ported inputs has been converted into local currency at the ongoing rate of
exchange of US$1 - CPA 250.
Rates of Return
6.        On the basis of the foregoing assumptions, estimated rates of
return are:
Oil palm estate           20%
Oil palm outgrower        35%
Project                   23%
Detailed calculations are shown in Table 2.

Sensitivity Analysis
7.        The rate of return to outgrowers and estate plantations has been
tested under several assumptions as shown below:
Outgrowers    Estate
Cost + 10%                                       33           17

Cost + 20/Ave Benefits - 20                      24           11
