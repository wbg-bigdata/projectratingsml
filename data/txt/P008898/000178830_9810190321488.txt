APPRAISAL OF THE
ERDEMIR STEEL PLANT EXPANSION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Government of Turkey has asked for a Bank loan of US$76
million equivalent to help Eregli Demir ve Celik Fabrikalari, Turk Anonim
Sirketi (Erdemir), Turkey's largest integrated steel producer, to finance
the expansion of its present annual capacity of 900,000 tons of ingot equiv-
alent (after completion of some work under way) to 1.8 million tons with a
corresponding increase in finished flat steel products, medium plate, hot
and cold rolled sheets and tin plate. The plant is well located at Eregli,
north of Ankara on the Black Sea. It will continue to utilize local coal
and mainly local iron ore.
ii.       Erdemir, which is Turkey's second integrated steel mill, was com-
pleted in 1965 and has rapidly expanded its output to the point where it
almost wholly covers the Turkish demand for flat rolled products. In 1970,
the Company reported sales of about TL 1,100 million and earnings before
taxes of approximately TL 132 million; it is efficiently run, operates at
capacity and has good management, virtually all Turkish nationals.
iii.      The Turkish Government holds a majority of Erdemir's shares (58%),
with Koppers Associates (a consortium of U.S. firms who designed, built and
ran-in the original plant) and the Turkish private sector sharing the rest
in about equal parts. The Company's statutes provide for its operations to
be conducted as a private enterprise, regardless of the extent of the State's
shareholding, and for eventual transfer to private ownership. The Govern-
ment and Erdemir have agreed to ensure that the Company continues to be run
as a private enterprise, free from the constraints under which Turkish
Government-owned firms (State Economic Enterprises) operate.
iv.       The Turkish market for flat steel products has been expanding
rapidly and at times has revealed shortages due to import restrictions. Fur-
ther vigorous growth in steel-consuming industries is expected to increase
the market for Erdemir's flat products in Turkey by about 10% annually (against
a 7% annual growth in GNP) from about 486,000 tons in 1970 to 1.3 million tons
by 1980. This is roughly equivalent to Erdemir's capacity after completion
of the project (Stage I) assuming that the Company would later (Stage II)
undertake some additions to its hot and cold rolling facilities. It is ex-
pected that in the foreseeable future Erdemir will remain Turkey's only pro-
ducer of flat steel.
v.        The major facilities to be financed under the proposed project
include a second blast furnace, a third oxygen steel vessel, the Company's
first continuous casting unit, a semi-continuous hot strip mill replacing
an existing reversing "Steckel" mill, a doubling of existing cold rolling
capacity and various other supporting and auxiliary facilities. Stage I is



- ii -
expected to be completed by 1975, at about the time Stage II which is out-
side the present project, would need to be taken up depending on market
developments.
vi.       The project was defined in a comprehensive project report prepared
by U.S. Steel Engineers and Consultants in collaboration with the Company.
Koppers Company of U.S.A. have been appointed the General Engineering Contrac-
tor, to be responsible for project design and construction management. The
Company will also have a long-term technical assistance contract with an es-
tablished steel producer outside of Turkey. Training will be organized with
the engineering contractor and equipment suppliers. These arrangements are
satisfactory to assure efficient execution of the project.
vii.      Project cost, excluding interest during construction but including
additional working capital, is estimated at US$290 million equivalent, of
which US$181 million would be in foreign exchange. Adequate contingencies
and price escalation are included. Since project cost estimates have origi-
nally been based wholly on U.S. equipment, no revision for currency revalua-
tion appears necessary, but an additional amount of US$5 million for con-
tingencies is available in the Eximbank loan to cover possible foreign ex-
change project cost increases. The financing plan provides for the whole of
the foreign exchange cost of US$181 million to be borrowed on long term
through parallel financing as follows (in US$ million): U.S. Export-Import
Bank (65) 1/; U.S. AID (40); and the Bank (76). Local currency cost would
be covered by internally generated funds (US$109 million). Any cost over-
run--both foreign and local--would be met by the Turkish Government as needed
by the Company to complete the project within the agreed execution schedule.
viii.     Procurement against the Eximbank loan will be tied to the USA, and
those items will be preallocated in which the U.S. is judged to be most com-
petitive. The remaining equipment will be obtained on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding, all awards to U.S. suppliers being first set
off against the AID loan. Once the Bank loan is exhausted any remaining
equipment will be bilaterally procured from the U.S.A. against the balance
of the AID loan. With the recent currency realignments, it is expected
that a large part, if not the whole, of the AID loan will be taken up by
lowest evaluated U.S. bids emerging from international competitive bidding.
If the full AID loan would be so used, up to 65% of the foreign exchange
cost of the project will be covered by worldwide tender.
ix.       The original plant was heavily financed with debt which currently
is still about four times the equity. Most of the debt is held by AID and
the remainder by the Government. New equity capital being difficult to pro-
cure, Erdemir, the Government and AID have finalized a scheme of debt re-
structuring involving subordination, deferral and rescheduling of existing
loans to lay the basis for new borrowings. A policy of retaining most of-
1/   Plus US$5 million available for contingencies.



- iii -
the earnings is expected to ensure adequate debt service coverage and lead
to an acceptable debt/equity ratio some two years after the project is ex-
pected to be completed in 1975.
x.        Financial projections also indicate that the Company should be
able to support some additional borrowing which will be required by about
1975-76 to help finance its Stage II project, and that from around 1980
Erdemir could support further expansion largely from retained earnings,
and if necessary, new equity.
xi.       Erdemir's selling prices were significantly raised in July 1971,
to cover substantial increases in the costs of a wide range of domestic
inputs and also to help finance the project. On the basis of the 1976
product mix, Erdemir's average selling price per ton of steel is calculated
to be about 12% above the landed (ex-warehouse, Istanbul) price of equiva-
lent duty-free imports, and on the average also compares favorably with
European domestic prices, without taking account of the possible upward
pressure on European steel export prices due to the recent currently re-
adjustments.
xii.      The internal economic return of the project is estimated at about
18%, and the internal financial return on the incremental investment at 21%.
The economic return is above what would normally be expected in a steel
project. This is primarily due to the fact that the project is closely
tailored to anticipated market growth, and can therefore be expected to
run at a high degree of capacity utilization from the outset, and that
some facilities with a high return would be in operation before the rest
of the project is completed. On the other hand, while these forecasts are
attainable, they demand speedy project execution, continuation of the effi-
cient management that Erdemir now has, and above all, no interference by
factors that would adversely affect the country's rate of economic growth
and thus the demand for the Company's products.
xiii.     Based on the agreements reached during negotiations, the project
is suitable for a Bank loan of US$76 million equivalent for a term of 15-1/2
years including 5 years of grace. A guarantee fee of 1-1/2% per annum is
to be paid to the Government by the Company, in addition to the Bank's normal
lending rate.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Turkey on behalf of Eregli Demir ve Celik Fabri-
kalari, Turk Anonim Sirketi (Erdemir) has asked the Bank to participate in
financing the expansion of Erdemir's flat products' steel mill at Eregli
on the Black Sea (about 300 km east of Istanbul and north of Ankara) from a
present annual capacity, in place or under construction, of 0.9 million in-
got tons 1/ to 1.8 million ingot tons by 1975. The Government owns a major-
ity of Erdemir's shares.  The original mill, completed in 1965, was financed
largely (about US$130 million equivalent) by the U.S. Agency for Interna-
tional Development (AID) and the Turkish Government.
1.02      An initial project feasibility study prepared by the Koppers Com-
pany of the U.S.A. (Koppers) in November 1969, was followed by a further com-
prehensive study by United States Steel Engineers and Consultants (UEC) of
Pittsburgh, which formed the basis of the Bank's appraisal. The project, de-
signated as Stage I of the Company's longer range expansion program, together
with additional working capital is estimated to cost US$290 million equival-
ent of which US$181 million is foreign exchange. Project completion is sched-
uled for 1975, when Erdemir will consider proceeding with Stage II to bring
about futher rationalization of production, and add more finishing capacity.
1.03      The Koppers and UEC studies indicated that Erdemir's expansion was
economically justified, but that it required a major restructuring of the
Company's existing heavy long-term debts to provide an adequate debt service
coverage, while at the same time permitting Erdemir to charge reasonably
competitive selling prices.
1.04      Bank missions consisting of Messrs. B. Walstedt, A. Basak, G.
Becher and W. O'Neil of the Industrial Projects Department and two ecolo-
gical consultants, Drs. Katz and Barbaro appraised the project in Turkey
in April and September 1971.
II. THE COMPANY
A.   Origin
2.01      The Company was formed in May 1960 with a guaranteed capacity of
470,000 ingot tons/year but with relatively inexpensive expansion possibilities
to over 800,000 tons/year. Equipment for the mill was supplied by Koppers
Associates, a consortium of three major U.S. suppliers - Koppers, Blaw-Knox
and Westinghouse International. Koppers also provided design, engineering,
construction management and (under a five-year renewable contract since
terminated by mutual agreement) general management assistance. Construction
started in May 1961, and the mill began operating in late 1965.

- 2 -
2.02      The final cost of the project was about US$292 million including
US$66 million of working capital and some "non-plant" items such as staff
housing. Most of the US$63 million cost overrun was associated with local
expenditure. Even though the capacity of the mill later proved substantially
higher than the conservative performance levels guaranteed by Koppers (nearly
50% more in some key operating units), Erdemir suffered in its early stages
of operations from its high investment costs (over US$415/annual ingot ton)
and its small scale of operations. An interim expansion and the present
project are expected to reduce overall investment cost to about US$340/ton
at an annual capacity of 1.8 million ingot tons.
B.   Present Facilities
2.03      The plant site is located on the BlacK Sea coast some 2 km from
the town of Eregli. Raw materials (principally iron ore and coal) are
received by sea while finished products are shipped either by sea or by truck.
The port can receive vessels of up to 50,000 dwt. The plant has one blast
furnace and two oxygen steel converters, a reversing Steckel mill for hot-
rolling, and facilities for cold-rolling, tinning and finishing operations.
Galvanizing on the other hand is not undertaken by Erdemir. The main products
are plates, narrow strip (mostly for welded tubes), hot and cold rolled sheets
and tin-plate. About 46% of the output is cold-rolled. Enough space exists
for expanding the plant to about 5 million ingot tons per year.
C.   Production and Financial Position
2.04      The Company's production, sales, earnings and balance sheets from
1966 to 1970 are shown in Tables 1 to 3 and summarized below:

2.05      Except for a strike in 1969 and the unscheduled relining of its
blast furnace in 1971 which accounted for the drop in production and profit
in that year, Erdemir has been able to run its plant close to capacity. In
the past two years it sup?lied all but a small portion of Turkey's require-
ments of flat products, although in 1971 this was only possible through the
import of semi-finished steel (slabs and hot rolled coils), to replace lost
production on account of the blast furnace relining. Under an interim expan-
sion program which is expected to be completed by late 1972, the Company is
presently raising ingot capacity to about 0.9 million tons per year, and im-
proving blast furnace operations and ore use through the construction of a
sinter plant.
2.06      Substantial price increases for a wide range of domestic products
were approved by the Government from mid-1971 affecting coal, rail freights,
tax on fuel oil, and electricity. These together with a steep rise in salaries
and wages have increased Erdemir's operating costs. Erdemir's selling prices,
which are essentially controlled by the Government and had remained unchanged
since 1968, were raised on average by 25% in July 1971 to offset Erdemir's
cost increases and also help finance its expansion program.
2.07      AID is the Company's largest creditor, accounting for close to
80% of its long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 1970. Dollar debts
rose sharply in terms of Turkish Lira with its devaluation in August 1970
(67%), but will decrease slightly with the recent change in currency
parities (7%),
D.   Ownership, Management and Labor
2.08      Erdemir's shares are held by the Government (58.4%), Koppers
Associates (18.9%), the Turkish private sector including the Is Bank and
the Ankara Chamber of Commerce and Industry (20.8%) and foreign individuals
(1.9%) (Table 4). One-half of the Government's shares are preference shares
with voting rights equal to one-half of ordinary shares, giving it a 51.5%
voting majority. The Company's Articles of Association provide for the
Government shares to be resold to private investors at the higher of par
or market value, at which time they would automatically be converted into
ordinary shares. This conversion was to have taken place by 1967 but with
the shares still being quoted under par has not yet occured.
2.09      Mr. Ali Cimen, previously President of Karabuk 1/, is Chairman of
Erdemir's Board of Directors. The Board has nine members of which four are
nominated by the Government (two each by Karabuk and Sumerbank), one each
by the IS Bank and the Chamber of Commerce and three by Koppers.  Erdemir's
Articles of Association specifically provide that, regardless of the pro-
portion of the state shareholding, the Company should be regarded and run
1/   State-owned irozn and Steel Corporation of Turkey at Karabuk, primarily
a producer of non-flat products.

as a private enterprise. Implementation of this arrangement has allowed the
Company to build up a competent and efficient staff and to follow business-
like attitudes and procedures, to the advantage of its operations. It has
been agreed during negotiations that this arrangement will not be altered
without the prior consent of the Bank.
2.10      Executive management of the Company is vested in the President
who attends Board meetings but is not a member of the Board. Mr. Metin
Iplikci, a mechanical engineer and until lately President of the State Cement
Corporation has been President since January 1971. Like his predecessors he
provides vigorous and capable leadership. One Senior Vice President (Mr.
Kenan Okan) and eight functional Vice Presidents ably assist Mr. Iplikci with
executive management. Both top and middle management are efficient and
result-oriented and benefit from an excellent operational and budgetary control
and reporting system which is in use. Nevertheless, Mr. Iplikci is aware of
the need to strengthen some parts of Erdemir's management and organization to
handle the large expansion program, and generally to allow the Company to face
up to the challenge of Turkey's economic association with the European Common
Market in the course of the next 10-15 years.
2.11      The original plant was started up and run by expatriate technicians
and operators, but these have now largely been replaced by Turkish nationals
who were trained alongside and have quickly picked up the required skills.
At the end of 1971 personnel strength stood at about 4,100. Despite steady
improvement in man-hours per ton steel produced, operational efficiencies are
still below European standards mainly because of Erdemir's small scale. With
one labor union representing the workers, labor relations have on the whole
been satisfactory with only 12 days lost from labor disputes since 1965.
III. THE MARKET
A.   The Turkish Industrial Setting
3.01      Turkish manufacturing output grew by about 10% per year in the
1960's. Growth was spurred by the "new" industrial materials and equipment
industries, such as steel, fertilizers, machinery, motor vehicles and trac-
tors. They account today for roughly the same proportion of the total value
added as traditional industries (i.e., food, textiles, and wood products).
Next to machinery, steel showed the highest growth rate of all industrial
sectors, reflecting the coming into production of Erdemir.
3.02      Industrial growth during the current decade will be determined
mainly by three factors: (a) the extent to which Turkey's balance of payments
problem can be solved; (b) progress in the liberalization of trade and Turkey's
integration with the European Common Market; and (c) Government economic poli-
cies, particularly the degree of encouragement given to the private sector and
foreign investments, and the willingness radically to change the structure and

3.03      Development of labor and entrepreneurial skills combined with
low Turkish wages and increasing access to the European market, could lead
to dynamic industrial growth. Nevertheless, there are also significant
uncertainties regarding the overall growth of the economy and, in particular,
the pattern of industrial growth.
B.   Domestic Market for Flat 3teel
3.04      Total steel consumption in Turkey has grown by 5.5% cumulatively
during the 1950's and by 12.3% during the 1960's, with an average annual
increase of 9% from 1950 to 1970. Consumption in 1969 had reached 1.4
million tons of finished steel, or about 41 kg per capita (Table 5). The
proportion of flat-rolled to total steel products remained at slightly
less than one-third over most of the period (Table 6). Over the last four
years, after Erdemir came into production, the use of flat products has
increased by about 13% per year, with Erdemir covering an increasing share
of the market, as shown in the following table:
Supply of Flat Steel Products
(1,000 tons)
Imports and
Erdemir           Karabuk           Total       Index
1967             261              66                327        100
1968              360             62                422        129
1969             415              46                461        141
1970             486              39                525        161
Imports which are quantitatively controlled, totalled about 10,000 tons in
1970, essentially in special steels not made in Turkey.
3.05      UEC projected the future Turkish demand for flat steel products
by using a global and an end-use approach. The global approach related
the use of flat steel to the gross national product in a simple regression
and resulted in an increase in flat steel demand during the 1970's of 10%
per year. The end-use approach involved an estimation of the projected
steel requirements of major users based on their future plans and yielded
an annual rate of growth of 14%. This latter result, however, appeared
to UEC to reflect short-range optimism stemming from current high demand
rather than realistic long-range plans or expectations of the consuming
industries. For the purpose of planning the expansion of Erdemir's production
capacity, UEC therefore depended on the results of the global approach.
3.06      In 1970, Turkey's GNP grew by 5.6%, compared with an average of
6.6% in the four preceeding years, but the Bank anticipates that Turkey has



- 6 -
the ability to grow at a rate in excess of 7% -/, the same rate UEC assumed
in its forecast. In a developing country it is typical for steel consump-
tion to increase more rapidly than GNP (9% for steel vs 5.2% for GNP in
Turkey from 1948-1969), or even in a developed country during periods of
rapid economic growth which are accompanied by intense capital spending
and therefore steel consumption. The following table shows some compari-
sons of the growth of steel consumption and GNP at constant prices.
Average Annual Growth of Ingot Steel vs GNP, 1957-1967
% Steel                           Ratio Steel

Japan                       15.0                10.1            1.48
Greece                      11.9                 6.5            1.83
Mexico                      9.3                  6.3            1.47

U.S.A.                      2.7                  4.1            0.66
UEC concluded that Turkish steel demand could rise 1.43 times the growth of
GNP or at an annual rate of 10%.  Assuming further that flat steel would
continue to contribute about 31% of total steel demand--which is likely to
be conservative at Turkey's present state of development-UEC projected the
Turkish domestic flat steel demand (excluding special steels and Karabuk's
present flat steel production) as follows:
Projected Turkish Domestic Market for Erdemir's Flat Steel Products
(1,000 tons)
1970        1975       1980
(actual)
UEC Estimate                         486          780        1,270
3.07      The project-Stage I-provides for an annual saleable output at
full production of 915,000 tons of flat products, 300,000 tons of billets,
60,000 tons of ingots and 180,000 tons of pig iron and the financial projec-
tions assume that this output will be reached by 1976 (Table 19). The future
growth in demand for flat products above this level of output is to be met
by a further expansion of rolling facilities to be operational under Stage
II in 1977. This plan is acceptable as it affords a cover against the risk
of cyclical fluctuations as well as the chances of the growth in GNP falling
below 7% per annum.
3.08      The Bank is inclined to project Turkey's demand for flat steel
products through 1980 somewhat higher than the UEC estimate (Annex 1). This
implies a margin of safety for the project. Should the flat steel demand in
fact prove to be higher than the UEC estimate, the Company could advance the
1/   "Memorandum on the Current Economic Position and Prospects of Turkey" -
-    June 24, 1971.



- 7 -
additional rolling capacity planned for Stage II and advance the installation
of continuous slab casting which might otherwise be included later (paras.
4.03 and 4.04).
C.   Marketing
3.09      Most of Erdemir's output is sold directly to ultimate consumers,
whose number tripled, from 408 in 1968 to 1,238 in 1970. The Company has
found this direct contact advantageous and necessary to minimize speculative
buying by middlemen in periods of pronounced shortage. The Company maintains
its own sales offices in the major cities. Inventory of finished products
at the mill has recently been maintained at 10-12% of sales; this is a low
figure and reflects the favorable market situation. Erdemir has orders for
virtually a whole year's output, hence, it can schedule production runs eco-
nomically. Most sales are against cash; credit is given mainly to a few
Government agencies but amounts to substantially less than advances by
customers.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Purpose and Major Facilities
4.01      The project (Stage I) involves an approximate doubling of key
facilities and includes the following major additions:

- 8 -
4.02      A detailed description of the installations forming part of the
project and their timing is given in Tables 7 and 9. Apart from the in-
crease in capacity and improved economies of scale, the project will provide
the following major benefits to plant operations:
a.   Operating advantages will arise through increased capacity of
the existing "combination" slabbing/plate mill when producing
slabs for the new semi-continuous strip mill instead of reducing
them further for the Steckel mill.
b.   Quality improvements will come from the capability to produce
coils of lighter gauge with closer tolerances and better sur-
faces, and the production of plate through a new normalizing
furnace.
C.   Greater operating security and flexibility will be achieved
through the second blast furnace, additional finishing
facilities and the freeing of the combination mill for addi-
tional plate production.
B.   The Project in the Longer-Range Planning Perspective
4.03      As early as 1977, Erdemir's Stage I capacity would fall short of
expected flat products demand, a gap which could build up to some 355,000 tons
in 1980 (Table 10). In Stage II additional rolling facilities are planned
in order to increase output of flat products and reduce sales of semi-finished
items (billets, pig iron). These additions might include primary mill improve-
ments or continuous slab casting, hot mill and tandem mill modifications, addi-
tional cleaning, annealing, temper rolling, tinning, and finishing capacity
(Table 8).
4.04      Once market growth and product mix patterns are firmly established
during the 1970's, major additional plant expansion (beyond Stage II) will
probably be required in about 1980. Such expansion should be guided by the
latest technical/economic developments available at the time, but would prob-
ably include a new coke plant, a third larger blast furnace, basic oxygen
furnace, separate plate mill and slab caster, conversion of semi-continuous
to fully continuous hot mill, new cold mill and possibly galvanizing and
coating lines. As technology progresses, the conventional hot metal/steel
processes indicated previously could conceivably be substituted by new ap-
proaches such as greater use of prereduced and prepared burdens, and direct
reduction. Annex 2 discusses major technological and economic trends in
steel production. The Company has agreed during negotiations to have a com-
prehensive study of its expansion plans for Stages II and III completed by
the end of 1973. The Government has also agreed to coordinate the growth of
the steel companies in Turkey, to allow economic expansion of individual
plant capacities within Turkey's total needs.



-9-
C.   Ecology
4.05      Steel plants are frequently criticized for air and water pollution
(Annex 3). Two ecologists engaged by the Bank studied the situation at
Eregli in detail in September 1971. Their findings confirm that environmental
damage due to present plant operations are minor, although attention must be
given - as the plant expands - to acid and phenol disposal, sewage treatment,
mill service water effluent, smoke and sulfur dioxide emissions, and possibly
other items. The Company has agreed during negotiations to undertake ecolog-
ical improvements acceptable to the Turkish Government and the Bank. A pro-
vision of US$5.0 million has been included in the project cost estimate for
this purpose.
D.   Project Management, Training, Technical Assistance and Project Schedule
4.06      For efficient management control, the Company has recently estab-
lished a Corporate Engineering Department to deal with the immediate expan-
sion project, as well as future market analyses and long range facility plan-
ning. This new department, assisted by additional Turkish and expatriate
personnel will oversee and review the activities of Koppers, who in competi-
tion with four other engineering firms, have been appointed the General
Engineering Contractor. The functions of the Engineering Contractor will
include design engineering, writing of specifications, procurement, scheduling,
budgeting, overall construction management, supervision of start-up, and
acceptance of equipment.
4.07      With the exception of the continuous billet caster and, to a lesser
extent, the semi-continuous hot strip mill, Erdemir personnel are well ex-
perienced in operating the general type of plant included in the project.
However, technological advances and design modifications on newly introduced
equipment, make it imperative that training be thorough to assure continuing
economic operations after completion of start-up. Direct operator training
will be accomplished in conjunction with equipment suppliers, and by observa-
tion of operating facilities in other countries.
4.08      The Company has agreed to enter into a long-term technical assist-
ance contract with an efficient international steel producer not later than
mid-1972, for purposes of technical assistance, training and operating manage-
ment techniques. The Bank would allow US$1.0 million from its loan to be used
for the foreign exchange fees and expenses of such a contract.
4.09      The General Engineering Contractor has started work, and it is
expected that some critical equipment will be ordered b- mid-1972 and the
project essentially completed by 1975. The project's construction schedule
is shown in Table 9 and tentative disbursements by quarters in Table 11.

V. RAW MATERIALS
A.   General
5.01      The availability, quality and cost of the two raw materials, iron
ore and coking coal, are of major importance to most steel producers and so
are other purchased materials such as fluxes, steel scrap, ferro-alloys, tin,
fuel oil, power, sulfuric acid, molds, stools, rolls and spare parts. In
1970, iron ore and coal on the one hand and these other inputs on the other,
totalled TL 354 and TL 234 million respectively, or about 76% of Erdemir's
cost of goods sold. Inputs other than ore and coal are normally available
to a steel mill in a developing country at a combined cost somewhat higher
than in industrialized countries. In the case of Erdemir, the cost disadvan-
tage of these other purchased materials was roughly 7% in 1970.
B.   Iron Ore
5.02      Previously, Erdemir had been using mainly lower quality domestic
ores, but has started utilizing some high-grade imported ores (Table 12),
primarily to increase blast furnace output, and will continue to do so in
the future. Despite such admixture, there will still be a cost penalty in
using predominantly domestic ores. This is only partly a matter of price;
domestic ores are now available at about 26 US cents per unit of Fe-in-ore
(Table 13), compared to 22/23 cents for imported ores. More importantly,
the use of lower-grade domestic ores reduces blast furnace output (by about
240,000 tons of iron per year) and also increases coke and limestone con-
sumption. The resulting reduction in gross earnings would be particularly
pronounced whenever the Company would lose sales because of lower blast
furnace output (Tables 14 and 15).
5.03      The Government during negotiations has agreed to conduct a tech-
nical and economic study on the best methods of improving the production
and transportation of domestic iron ore, and making it more competitive.
Until concrete results are achieved from actions taken under this study,
Erdemir will be permitted to import a portion of its iron ore, to enrich
its ore blend and reduce costs.
C.   Coal
5.04      Erdemir obtains all its coal from TKI (State Coal Company) mines.
Although somewhat high in ash, this coal is well suited for the manufacture
of metallurgical coke. By 1980, the Turkish steel industry would consume
the bulk of the presently projected output of 6.8 million tons of coal per
year. After the mid-1971 price increase and with the revalued Turkish Lira
(January 1972), Turkish coal is slightly more costly (by about 7%) than im-
ported coal.  In this calculation allowance has been made for its higlh ash
content which results in lower coke yields and higher coke consumption in
the blast furnace. An analysis of the iron ore and coal supply and price
prospects is given in Annex 4.

/2   Included in civil works, installation and miscellaneous.
/3   Includes estimated US$5 million of local supplies in local contracts awarded
under international competitive bidding.
6.02      Interest and guarantee fees during construction of about US$30
million on project loans are not capitalized in the financial projections
but assumed to be paid out of operations. However, the Bank will allow up
to US$7 million of its loan to be drawn for payment of interest during con-
struction, reserving the right to reduce this allocation if more funds were
to be needed for the purchase of internationally bid equipment for the project.



- 12 -
6.03      The basic cost estimates of the project facilities were made by
UEC from their experience with similar installations and escalated to the end
of 1971. Foreign equipment costs have been further escalated, in line with
recent trends, at a rate of 6% per year from January 1972, or altogether by
US$16.3 million. In addition, contingencies of US$8.2 million (6%) have been
provided to cover possible cost increases due to unforeseen changes in the
scope and design of the project. Local capital expenditures relating mainly
to materials, labor and equipment for construction have been escalated by 10%
per year compounded from January 1972. The recent trend in construction costs
has been somewhat in excess of this rate, but 10% should be adequate as an
average, since the inflationary effects of the August 1970 devaluation, are
expected to taper off.
6.04      Revaluations of European and Japanese currencies may raise the
prices (measured in US dollars) of equipment manufactured in these countries,
although most likely not to the full extent of such revaluations due to pre-
sent strong competition among steel mill equipment suppliers. Since equip-
ment cost estimates were based on U.S. procurement, it is not expected that
the recent changes in currency parities will affect capital costs beyond the
contingencies allowed.
B.   Financing of the Project
6.05      The entire foreign exchange cost (US$181 million) of the project,
(including an estimated US$5.0 million of local supplies in local contracts
awarded under international competitive bidding) is planned to be financed
by borrowing, while the local cost (US$109 million) including an increase
in net working capital, will be financed from the Company's internally
generated funds. Since local currency requirements for the project are
intimately interwoven with Erdemir's other financial requirements such as
repayment of existing debt, the subject is fully discussed in Chapter IX
which deals with the Company's financial reorganization.
6.06      The financing plan is as follows:
Proposed Financing Plan
(US$ million)
Foreign Exchange Cost
Eximbank                            65
AID                                 40
IBRD                                76
Total Foreign Exchange Loans               181
Local Currency Cost
Internally Generated Funds                 109
290



- 13 -
A large part of the foreign exchange financing will come from bilateral
sources. However, quite apart from the fact that other untied funds (such
as from the European Investment Bank and the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau)
were not available in addition to funds already allocated to other projects
in Turkey, it will be shown below (para. 7.04) that the tied financing in
this case is unlikely to burden Turkey.
6.07      The US$181 million of foreign exchange financing is considered
adequate, but Eximbank has agreed to add another US$5 million for contin-
gencies, thus increasing its loan to US$70 million. Furthermore, the Gov-
ernment will cover any project cost overrun in local and foreign expendi-
tures, on terms satisfactory to the Bank and as needed by the Company to
complete the project within the agreed execution schedule.
6.08      The proposed Bank and AID loans would be made to the Turkish Gov-
ernment at assumed interest rates of 7-1/4% and 3% respectively and relent to
the Company at 8-3/4% and 7%. Both loans would be for 15-1/2 years including
a grace period of 5 years.
6.09      Eximbank's loan of US$70 million will be in three tranches and made
to the Turkish Government. US$28.5 million would be provided by Eximbank
directly at 6%; another US$28.5 million would come from commerical banks with
Eximbank's guarantee, presumably at 1-1/2% above the New York prime rate plus
a 3/4% guarantee fee to Eximbank. The third tranche of US$6 million would be
provided through suppliers' credits probably at 7% interest. The average cost
of Eximbank's financing to the Company would therefore be about 6.5%.
6.10      Under Eximbank's regulations the Borrower has to make a 10% down-
payment, in this case US$7 million. Erdemir will pay this amount in local
currency for conversion into dollars by the Government. The Eximbank loan
would be for 16 years including 4-1/2 years of grace. Erdemir's repayments
of principal would be used first to repay the suppliers' credits, then the
commercial banks and lastly Eximbank.
VII. PROCUREMENT
A.   Engineering and Procurement
7.01      Erdemir recently appointed Koppers as the contractor responsible
for engineering and construction management of the project. The foreign
exchange cost of these services estimated at about US$8.0 million will be
financed by Eximbank under its loan; biddIng was therefore restricted to
U.S. firms. While the Bank did not participate in the selection it reviewed
tne contract, and is satisfied that it covers Erdemir's needs, and will allow
procurement under the Bank's guidelines for equipment and services to be
financed by the Bank.

7.03      The engineering contract and some equipment -- for example, the
hot rolling mill - will be pre-allocated to the Eximbank loan for procure-
ment in the U.S.A. These are items in which U.S. manuractures are considered
to be fully competitive and in which a reasonable degree of competition ex-
ists within the U.S.A. (Table 17). The rest of the equipment, will be pro-
cured against lowest evaluated bids emerging from international competitive
bidding, all awards to U. S. suppliers being first set off against the AID
loan. Should the AID loan be exhausted before the Bank loan, further lowest
U.S. awards will be paid out of the Bank loan. Should the Bank loan be ex-
hausted first, the remaining equipment will be bilaterally procured from the
U.S.A. against the balance of the AID loan.
7.04      The recent currency realignments are expected to strengthen the
competitive position of U.S. suppliers, and might lead to a maximum of 65%
of the estimated foreign exchange costs of the project being procured
through international competitive bidding. Even if this percentage is
smaller, these arrangements are still satisfactory in view of the inability
to raise more untied financing for the project. Moreover, the lower interest
rates of the Eximbank and AID loans as compared to multinational financing,
ensures that any direct cost penalty to Turkey is minimal.
7.05      It is estimated that about US$5.0 million of local supplies may
be included in local bids awarded under international competitive bidding.
Procurement under the Bank loan will allow qualified Turkish suppliers to
bid, and they would be accorded a 15% preference of the CIF cost of imported
equipment or the customs duty, whichever is lower.
7.06      Contracts for civil works are not to be financed by the Bank loan,
but will be submitted to competitive bidding within Turkey. Should Erdemir
and the Bank agree that domestic construction industry constraints are result-
ing in construction delays and undue cost increases, international competitive
bidding for part of the civil works will be invited.

VIII. COSTS OF PRODUCTION AND SALE
8.01      Economies of scale achieved by the expansion project will lead
to a significant reduction in costs of production and sale per ton of
saleable product. The benefits accruing from the project after full start-
up are measured below against 1972, the year when the current expansion
program will be completed.

- 16 -
8.02      Part of the above reduction in per ton cost is due to a shift in
product mix. A more detailed analysis of the above cost is given in Annex 5,
containing both general observations on major factors determining these
costs and specific assumptions such as on operating rates, productivities,
wage and salary rates. The most important assumptions are:
a.   All costs are at September 1971 prices, except for salaries
and wages, which are assumed to increase by 3% annually in
real terms.
b.   To take care of cyclical fluctuations in demand, and
interruptions in production, actually attainable output
has been revised downward by 5%.
c.   Personnel of the Company is projected to grow only
slightly less than one-third as compared with an
increase in saleable output of 2-1/2 times.
d.   Depreciation of equipment is based on an assumed average
19-year economic life for existing installations and a
15-year economic life for new installations. This is in
line with present practice, e.g., in the U. K. and Japan.
8.03      Comparisons of production costs between different steel producers
in the world are difficult, not the least due to their varying product mix
which substantially influences production costs. But it is evident that (a)
Japanese steel conversion costs, comprising manpower costs plus charges on
capital, are the lowest among those on which data are available and (b) that
Erdemir in its present size is not competitive. However, improvement after
completion of the project is dramatic; in fact by 1976 Erdemir would be
nearly as competitive as the European mills reviewed. Even taking into
account the possibility of a future drop in European and particularly Belgian
conversion costs (Belgium has traditionally exported a major portion of its
steel output) it is suggested that after completion of the project, Erdemir
would be operating on an economically sound basis.
8.04      Erdemir's production costs are not low enough to warrant the in-
clusion of a permanent export quota in its sales projections. Nevertheless,
in the present phase of the Company's development, it is important that it
expands rapidly to achieve improved balancing and utilization of its facil-
ities in order to reduce costs. Exports would help in attaining this objec-
tive. During negotiations the Company has agreed to review the possibility
of exporting a portion of its output in future, as part of the study of its
further expansion in the mid- and later 1970's (para. 4.04).

IX. FINANCIAL REORGANIZATION, EARN-
INGS AND FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
A.   Financial Reorganization
9.01      Erdemir, from its inception, has been heavily geared towards debt.
At December 31, 1970, its long-term debt was TL 2,867 million and equity
TL 648 million, giving a debt/equity ratio of 82/18.
9.02      The Company's present heavy burden of debt repayments, made a
reorganization of its financial structure an essential precondition for any
new borrowings required for the expansion, to provide adequate protection to
the new lenders and allow retention of sufficient internally generated funds
for meeting local expenditures of the project. The Company, the Government
and AID have therefore agreed on a plan of restructuring interest payments
and amortizing existing debt as explained in detail in Table 18 and sum-
marized below.
9.03      The Turkish Government has agreed:
a.   to convert its main construction loan to the Company of
TL 469.4 million into a 30-year loan with a grace period
of 16-1/2 years, so that amortization would begin in 1988,
after existing and now proposed new foreign exchange loans
will have been fully repaid; to capitalize interest for
5 years, beginning January 1, 1971;
b.   to defer amortization and capitalize interest on three of
its other loans to the Company totalling TL 168.2 million
for a period of 4-1/2 years, commencing July 1, 1971 and
to defer debt service beyond that period if this would
cause Erdemir's current ratio to fall below 1.5.
9.04      AID has agreed:
a.   to defer principal repayments due in 1972 and 1973 on Part A
of its foreign exchange loan of TL 1,449 million;
b.   to extend the grace period of Part B of its foreign exchange
loan by two years to October 1, 1974;
c.   to defer repayments of principal and capitalize interest
on its main Turkish Lira loan of TL 111.6 million for
five years beginning in 1972 and to defer debt service
beyond that period if this causes Erdemir's current ratio
to fall below 1.5.



- 18 -
9.05      The Government took two further measures previously mentioned, to
improve the Company's ability of self-financing. In July 1971, it permitted
a price increase for the Company's products, slightly higher than required
to offset increases in costs. In addition, the Government authorized the
Company to depreciate its fixed assets over 15 years for new assets, and
over the same period from 1971 for assets previously acquired, against a
period of 29 years that applied hitherto. Tax reliefs will be allowed on
the accelerated basis.
B.   Financial Projections
9.06      Projected Sales, Income Statements, Cash Flow and Balance Sheets
are shown in Tables 19 to 22 and are summarized on the following page. The
projections were made on the basis of September 1971 prices for both inputs
and outputs (on the assumption that the price structure will remain unchanged
in real terms) except for salaries and wages which are assumed to increase
by 3% annually in real terms to reflect an improvement in the standard of
living in Turkey (Table 23). Profits and cash generation in 1971 were reduced
by the unscheduled blast furnace relining, but are expected to increase grad-
ually from 1972, showing a significant rise upon completion of the project
in 1975/76.
9.07      During the construction years debt service coverage is adequate
but drops to a low of 1.5 times in 1977 after start of repayment of the
new loans. However, by then the Company is expected to have accumulated a
substantial cash balance. After 1977, debt service coverage is expected to
improve gradually and be above 1.7 times by 1979.
9.08      The financial projections assume the implementation of a policy
of maximum retention of earnings and no new borrowing or capital expenditures
beyond routine outlays, so as to build up equity and improve the debt/equity
ratio as quickly as possible. No dividends are to be paid except to the
Company's non-founder shareholders at the rate of 9.5%. Dividends to found-
er shareholders and any other possible cash distributions, will only be per-
mitted after the debt/equity ratio drops below 60/40, and then only if after
such payments, current assets are in excess of current liabilities by at least
1.8 times. Such a policy is expected to improve the debt/equity ratio from
72/28 in 1976 to 59/41 in 1978.
C.   Financing of Long-Range Expansion
9.09      The above financial projections were prepared for Stage I only.
Nevertheless, as explained in para. 4.03 the expected growth of Turkey's
domestic demand, will require the implementation of Stage II to increase
the plant's capacity for producing flat products possibly as early as 1975.
Erdemir's financial position between 1975 and 1980 was therefore examined,
to determine possibilities for financing Stage II which will require about
US$75 million equivalent, including additional working capital. Table 24
shows Erdemir's projected cash position through 1980 with Stage I plus
Stage II, indicating that the Company would need TL 140 million (US$10 mil-
lion) of additional financing in 1975 and 1976. These financing requirements

would be less if Stage II is delayed. On the basis of the projections,
Erdemir's financial position should permit these new borrowings, and the
Company should be able to finance further expansion beyond Stage II largely
from internally generated funds, and if necessary, new equity.
D.   Internal Financial Return and Sensitivity Analysis
9.10      Internal financial return calculations (before payment of corpo-
rate taxes) and sensitivity analysis together with major assumptions, for
the incremental investment in the project are shown in Table 25 and sum-

/2   Selling prices down 10% from 1977 onward.
9.11      The financial return on the incremental investment in the project
is estimated at about 21% (Case 1).  Case 5 would indicate the lowest return
of about 13% that may realistically be expected.  Returns below this are at-
tributable to circumstances which are unlikely to occur.  A 25% drop in sales
revenue would reduce the return to about 8% (Case 3), and if this is coupled
with a project cost increase, the return would be even 'Lower (Case 6).
9.12      The Government and the Company have the intention of reducing sell-
ing prices in real terms if practicable, around 1977. A 10% drop in selling
prices at that time would reduce the return to 18% (Case 7) or 15.6% if
coupled with higher project cost (Case 9). Case 10 shows that such a price
reduction would not be practicable if operating costs had at the same time
risen by 25%. The Bank is interested in the Company charging prices which
are adequate to allow Erdemir to meet its financial obligations and contrib-
ute to the financing of future expansions, but once this condition has been



- 21 -
met, any further cost decline in producing steel should be reflected in a
reduction in steel prices in real terms, for the benefit of the Turkish con-
sumer. The Company has agreed that it will consult with the Bank before
altering selling prices.
X. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A.   The World Steel Industry - Present Position and Growth Dynamics
10.01     In 1969, industrialized countries accounted for all but a small
portion of the world steel output of 570 million tons and consumed most of
it. Developing countries produced some 25 million tons and imported an-
other 14 million tons from industrialized countries; the main exporters
were Western Europe and Japan.
10.02     The cost structure in steel favors industrialized countries in
certain important respects. Imports of iron ore and coal can be delivered
to Western Europe or Japan at a cost equal to, or even less (due to economies
in large scale ocean transport) than the equivalent cost to most developing
countries. The cost of capital and project cost per se are lower in indus-
trialized countries. This is significant since the capital per person em-
ployed in the steel industry is high, varying between US$50,000 and US$100,000.
Last, but most important, economies of scale are very considerable: the per
ton capital and manpower requirements for a 500,000 ton flat products in-
tegrated mill, about Erdemir's initial size, would normally be about twice
as high as for a 2 million ton mill.
10.03     In recent years, there has been dynamic change in the steel industry,
compounded by rapid technological evolution, drastically reduced ocean freight
rates leading to the establishment of giant new mills at ocean side locations,
and growing financial concentration favoring structural rationalization and
facilitating the provision of new funds. In the U.K., as well as in France
and Belgium, structural rationalization was made a condition for public
financing, which was provided on terms amounting to a subsidy.
B.   Future World Prices
10.04     This background of technological progress, economies of scale, mod-
ernization and publicly supported financing explains the trend towards a de-
cline in real steel prices during the last decade, interrupted only by rela-
tively short price booms (Chart I). Future world steel prices are difficult
to predict with any great confidence, but real prices are likely to decline
gradually, with increasing productivity of both capital and labor.  While
the effect of productivity increases on manpower costs is likely to be ab-
sorbed by higher wages and salaries, depreciation allowances and returns on
capital per ton of steel should decline as very large new coastal mills in
the 8 - 12 million ton range are completed and as existing plants are fur-
ther depreciated. On balance, steel production costs (measured in terms of
1971 dollars) may fall by US$5-$7.50 per ton of finished steel.

C.   Erdemir's Domestic Selling Prices as Compared with Import Prices
10.05     Price comparisons on large tonnages of diversified product mix
and under widely varying world production and marketing conditions are dif-
ficult to make, and Table 26 explains the reasons for these difficulties in
some detail. Nevertheless, it is believed that the following evaluation of
the Company's competitive position vis-a-vis import prices and comparisons
with domestic prices in other European steel producing countries are mean-
ingful.
10.06     Annex 6 contains a detailed discussion of Erdemir's prices in
relation to world prices, as at March 1971, prior to Erdemir's mid-1971
price increases and movements in European and Japanese currency valuations.
Table 27 shows the Company's new increased selling prices against import
prices of similar categories of steel at the exchange rate of US$1 - TL 15.
Both prices are "delivered at Istanbul" where most imports are landed, and
ex-duty. C.I.F. import prices have been increased by 10% to cover landing
costs, letter of credit and financial charges, and warehousing costs. Users
of steel in Turkey are prepared to pay a premium of over 20% to have steel
available on call from Erdemir, rather than follow costly and cumbrous im-
port procedures.
10.07     Average domestic and import prices net of taxes, shown in Table 27,
are summarized below:

- 23 -
10.08     Import prices shown in the above table are those which prevailed
before the recent currency realignments. In fact, recently (January 1972)
export prices of steel in European Common Market countries have increased
by between US$5 and US$10 per ton or 2% to 8% of the FOB Europe prices.
These movements reduce the gap shown above between the Turkish domestic
price and the cost of imports.
D.   Comparison of Erdemir's Domestic and European Domestic Prices
10.09     Revaluation of European currencies are not expected to lead di-
rectly to changes in domestic steel prices, but a comparison of Erdemir's
with European domestic ex-mill prices, must take into consideration a higher
average revaluation of about 5% of the currencies of the European steel ex-
porting countries and Japan, in comparison with the Turkish Lira. In the
following table therefore, European and Erdemir's prices have been adjusted
accordingly for a few selected items for which - otherwise difficult - com-
parability is assured.

E.   Nominal and Effective Protection
10.10     On the basis of present prices and a range of possible increases
in export prices following upon currency revaluation (paras. 10.07 and 10.08),
protection, both nominal and "effective", required by Erdemir is calculated
in Table 28, and summarized below:
Rise in Import      Nominal           Effective
Prices          Protection         Protection
%                 x                  7%
0               11.7               22.17
3               8.5                18.18
4                7.4               17.58
6                5.4               14.42
10                1.6                9.73
"Effective" protection is about 16% after an adjustment of about 5% for
the effect on import prices of currency revaluation. This is considered
acceptable.
F.   Import Policy
10.11     Turkey's present steel import policy relies chiefly on quanti-
tative restrictions rather than on duties which average only about 15% for
steel products. When domestic production is available it is customary to
refuse requests for import licenses. Future policy will be guided by agree-
ments within the European Iron and Steel Community (EISC), although Turkey's
transitional affiliation with the European Economic Community (EEC) still
requires parliamentary approval in Turkey and EEC member countries. Turkey
has not yet made any specific commitments to reduce tariff or quantitative
restrictions for items included in the EISC product lists, although it has
agreed to negotiate a program of gradual reduction in the future; such nego-
tiations are not expected to start before 1975. A few steel products, such
as billets, are treated separately from those in the EISC lists, and these
products will be freed gradually from import restrictions over a 22-year pe-
riod. Turkey's affiliation with the EEC will also relax restrictions on prod-
ucts which use steel as a raw material and, thereby, will indirectly provide
competition for Erdemir.
G.   Foreign Exchange Savings
10.12     At full capacity operation of the project, Turkey will have incre-
mental annual foreign exchange savings of about US$73 million before servicing
of the new external debts for the project, reflecting a pay-off period of such
debts of about 2 1/2 years. Incremental foreign exchange savings after debt
service on the new external debts are estimated at about US$56 million annual-
ly (Table 29).

H.   Internal Economic Return
10.13     The internal economic return on the investment in the project has
been calculated by using landed import prices ex warehouse Istanbul (para.
10.07) for output (Table 25). Inputs which could be imported, such as coal,
iron ore, molds and stools, but which are procured domestically by the Com-
pany at higher than world market prices are valued at world market prices.
Inputs which the Company imports, such as tin, are valued exclusive of
Turkish import duties and taxes. Costs and benefits of the project to the
Turkish economy are thus valued at world market prices. Sensitivity tests
have been made for the effects on import prices of currency revaluations, to
show the impact that the currency revaluation should have on the internal
economic return.

8           110              100                106               18.6
Cases 2, 4, 6 and 8 - Project completion delayed one year, and project
cost up 10%.
The internal economic return of 18% on the project is attractive, and reflects
two main factors. Firstly, the incremental investment including working capi-
tal of US$320 per additional ingot ton produced is low and greatly improves
the capital/output ratio of the plant. Secondly, the project commences to
receive some benefits from the second year of construction through the con-
tinuous casting of billets, reaching full benefits from the fifth year, be-
cause of market development preceding plant expansion. This is more rapid
than applies to many other steel plants.
10.14     Under cases 3, 5 and 7, the economic return improves further
because of assumed long-term rises in import prices of 3%, 4%, and 6%
following upon European and Japanese currency revaluations, allowing the
use of higher levels of world prices in measuring the economic return.
10.15     A second rate of return which might be called "internal financial
return with zero nominal protection" has been calculated, assuming Erdemir
produces at actual operating cost but sells its products at world market
prices. This rate of return would be 15.4% at current import prices, with-
out any effects of currency revaluations.



- 26 -
10.16     Despite the apparent attractiveness of the project, it is emphasized
that eventual results in the task of putting a highly leveraged company like
Erdemir on a sound operational, financial and economic footing will depend
on several factors. The most important of these are that: (a) Turkey's
economy will need to grow at around 7% annually, within which demand for
flat steel products would rise by about 10%, requiring a fair amount of new
investments in steel consuming industries, and that (b) present management
practice and attitudes would continue, to ensure adherence to the project
schedule and operational and financial projections which, though realistic,
demand efficient performance. Given these general conditions, Erdemir can
reasonably be expected to achieve the projected results.
XI. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
11.01     Agreement was reached on the following principal points during
loan negotiations with:
A.   Co-lenders, the Government and the Company
(a)  Parallel foreign exchange financing in the amounts of US$65
million (plus US$5 million for contingencies) by Eximbank and
US$40 million by AID, the Government providing foreign exchange
to Erdemir for 10% down-payment on Eximbank-financed equipment
(paras. 6.05 - 6.10).
(b)  Financial reoroanization of the Company involving restructuring
of interest payments and amortization of existing debt to (i)
retain the maximum possible cash with the Company during the
construction period, (ii) provide adequate debt service coverage
and (iii) lay the foundation for sound future growth beyond the
project (paras. 9.02 - 9.04).
(c)  Pre-allocation of equipment to be procured in the U.S.A. against
Eximbank finance (para. 7.03).
(d)  Application of international competitive bidding to as much of
the AID loan of US$40 million as can be taken up by the lowest
evaluated U.S. bids (paras. 7.03 - 7.04).
B.   Government
(e)  Except with the prior consent of the Bank, the law setting up
Erdemir, or its Articles of Association are not to be amended,
to allow Erdemir to continue as a private enterprise (para. 2.09).
(f)  Coordination of the growth of steel companies in Turkey, to allow
economic expansion of individual plant capacities, within Turkey's
total needs (para. 4.04).



- 27 -
(g) Preparation of a study by December 31, 1973 on the best methods
of improving the production and transportation of domestic iron
ore to make it more competitive (para. 5.03).
(h) Permission to Erdemir to import a portion of its iron ore
requirements, to enrich its ore blend and reduce costs (para. 5.03).
(i) Guarantee to provide any additional funds, foreign exchange
or local, needed by the Company to complete the project in
the event of a project cost overrun (para. 6.07).
(j) Authorization of depreciation rates corresponding to a 15-year
average life for the project installations and from 1971 for
existing installations (para. 9.05).
C.   Company
(k) Preparation of a study on the Company's expansion plans by
December 31, 1973 for Stages II and III (para. 4.04).
(1) Implementation of measures for minimizing environmental damage
from the project (para. 4.05).
(m) Arrangement for technical assistance from a suitable steel
producing company outside of Turkey by June 30, 1972 (para. 4.08).
(n) Restriction on dividends except to non-founder shareholders,
unless and until a minimum debt/equity ratio of 60/40 is
achieved, and a current ratio of 1.8 is maintained (para. 9.08).
(o) Restriction on borrowings if debt/equity ratio would thereby
exceed 60/40; restriction on routine capital expenditures
during the construction period, and thereafter (para. 9.08).
(p) Consultation between Erdemir and the Bank on steel pricing
(para. 9.12).
11.02     With the indicated agreements, the proposed project constitutes
a suitable basis for a Bank loan to Erdemir of US$76 million equivalent,
for a term of 15-1/2 years including a 5-year grace period.

The figures for ingots and billets represent projected sales by Erdemir rather than the total market
which could exceed the projected sales.
i The fact that projected output would exceed normal blast furnace capacity is not highly significant,
since the projected output could be reached, if necessary, by various expedients, including a higher
admixture of rich imported ores or pellets. Alternately hot metal ratio in the BOF could be reduced
slightly.

L/  Both cases assume "orld Market Procurement" and escalation of domestic resource costs by 10 per cent.  The benefits from using foreign ores vary
substantially from one year to the next, (a) reflecting charges in the proportion of foreign ore to total ore and (b) depending upon whether the
main benefit is increasing output or (where there is a market constraint) reducing the cost of blast furnace operations.

NOTE:  This table has not been modified to reflect changes in delivered costs of ore, effective July, 1971, or changes in exchange rates, effective in Jan., 1972.                         DI
However, it effectively demonstrates the concepts used by UEC in comparing the economics of foreign Vs domestic ore and related order of magnitude of                              a
costs involved.                                                                                                                                                                      w
A very simple alternate calculation is shown on the following page for purposes of comparison.  Both calculations indicate similar "order of
magnitude" savings due to use of foreign ore.
In both cases, apparent results should be adjusted for business fluctuations and realistic appraisal of other ;-lternatives available for
increased iron production, such as a larger furnace, use of high top pressure, oxygen injection, different burden preparation, etc.

ALTERNATE CALCULATIONS
Economics of Fbreign and Domestic 07es
Based on Pig Iron Sales Qnly 1 /
Assumptions:
I. Blast Furnace Production:
a) with 100% foreign ore: 2706 tons/day/furnace
b) with "domestic ore": 2360 tons/day/furnace
(includes 500,000 T/yr foreign ore)
II. Approximate profit on additional sales of pig iron:
a)  Sales price                            1583 TI/ton or $105.53/ton
b) Less cost of production - approx.       810 TL/ton or   54.00/ton
(excluding depreciation, selling,
general administrative expense)
c)  Approximate gross profit -              773 TI/ton or $ 51.53/ton
III.  Approximate domestic ore costs delivered: 215 TI/ton or $ 14.33/ton
IV.  Approzimate domestic ore usage:             2.2 million tons
V.  Approximate foreign ore cost delivered
all fees paid:                           $14.00/ton
ROUGH CALCULATIONS
Capacity Considerations Only 21
a) Approximate reduction in capacity at full operative rate:
(700 furnace days/yr) (2706-2360) = 242,000 ton/yr potential
loss in capacity.
1/ Analysis based on pig iron for simplicity, since no other process
limitation, except pig machine, can enter.  In practice, products of
higher value would normally be considered.
In addition, major savings (at least $5 million/yr) in raw material pur-
chase costs also result from use of foreign ore. Most of these savings
apply even when market conditions do not require capacity operation. If
these savings are added to the amounts mentioned previously, the total
cost penalty associated with use of domestic ore amounts to over 50%.
3/ Based on US$1 = TL 15.



TABLE 14
Page 3
b) P>elated profit (if market is available and limited only by
blast furnace capacity):
(TL773) (242,000 TL/yr) - 187 milJ.on TI/yr or $12.5 million/yr
c) If this "lost profit" is arbitrarily related to cost of
domestic ore, for perspective, it is equal to:
187 millionWTI/yr            = 187 million TL
(2.2 million Tonsfyr) (215 TI/ton)      473 million TL
or 40% of the ore cost
d) If "lost profit" is related to total saleable product, it is
equal to:
l.255 million or $8.60/ton product
tons
Conclusion
When the given conditions apply and no other constraints limit sales of
pig iron (or other products with similar/bigher profit) lost blast furnace
capacity associated with use of domestic ore results in a significant cost
penalty to Erdemir.
For this reason, it would be highly advantageous to the company to
reserve the option to import foreign ore for economic reasons, in tomnages
required to support full operations - especially when sales are limited by
blast furnace capacity.

SALES PRICE COMPARISONS FOR STMEE
Selling price comparisons on steel products are sometimes subject
to appreciable error due to the fact that each ton of steel is somewhat
'tailor made" to a specific customer requirement and marketing conditions
vary significantly with time and geographic location. It is important to
verify the existence of similar products and conditions for meaningful
price comparisons.
Factors Influencing Costs and Prices - Flat Products
Some of the factors which influence costs of production and may
influence product pricing are given below. The importance of each individual
factor is influence      existing production facilities at a given plant and
can vary from plant to plant. Any valid price comparison should achieve
reasonable equity on the important items listed:
(a) Steel grade, chemistry (alloying elements, carbon  etc.).
(b) Thickness - (effects tons/hr. on production unitsS.
(c) Width - (effects tons/hr. on production units).
(d) Length, for cut products - (effects tons/hr. on produc-
tion units).
(e) Product end use - surface characteristics (i.e. a
refrigerator exterior panel is critical, where a sheet
for galvanizing i5 acceptable with many imperfections).
(f)  Tolerances - precise width, length, thickness, 'extra
flat', etc.
(g) Processes specified - as slit edge, pi kling (on H.R.
products), stretcher levelled, oiled surface   (influences
processing costs, yield losses, etc.).
(h) Processes not always specified - as skin pass on H.R.
products, electrolyticly cleaned C.R. products, etc.
(i) Inapection - rewind/reinspect; especially-certified in-
spection or extra chemistry checks, etc.
(j) Form of shipment - nsheets' shipped in coil form, cut
lengths, etc.
(k)  Packaging, coiJ/lift size - all metal wrap, paper wrap,
on wooden skids or platform, etc.
(1) Order size.
(m) Lead time.
(n) Condition of order book (may determine which extras are
actually charged for).
(o) Transportation (absorption of).
(p) Warehousing, handling (required to ship on schedule).
(q)  'other'.
For tinplate, the abDve, and many additional factors such as tin
coating weight, enter due to the very specialized nature oftbe product and
its end uses.

Conclusion
From the above, the difficulty of achieving meaningful price com-
parlsons on large tonnages of diversified product mix, under widely varying
world production and marketing conditions, becomes clear. Such comparisons
should be utilized as general indicators only, with due reservation for
their limitations with respect to accuracy.

ANNEX 1
PRESENT AND FUTURE MARKETS FOR ERDEMIR STEEL
A. General Background
1.       Total steel demand in Turkey has grown from about 300,000 product
tons in 1950 to an estimated 1.6 million tons in 1970, an average annual
cumulative increase of 9 percent. The proportion of imports in total supply
fell from 50-60 percent in the early 23501 '.to 20 percent in the middle
1960's and less than 10 percent since -; 967 when Erdemir started producing
significant quantities of flat steel (Table 5).
2.       The proportion of flat steel in total steel consumption averaged
30 percent in 1961/63 and 31 percent in 1967/69 (Table 6); it appears
to be rising only slowly, if at all.
3.       The following figures show changes in the supply of flat steel
products by sources 1967-1970.

Flat product equivalent using a yield factor of 0.75. These sheet
bars are rolled into sheets by a small "hand mill".
Over the last three years the supply of flat products has grown by over 60
percent.  Erdemir's market share is now over 90 percent.  When Erdemir will
no longer be constrained by capacity shortages, Karabuk's production of
sheet bars and sheets will fade away. Imports are already reduced to a
minimum of special sheet qualities, e.g. transformer sheets. The share of
such special qualities in the total demand may conceivably increase in the
future.
B. Market ProJection - Global Approach
4.       The Bank Staff - building on previous studies by SPO, the company,
and UEC - has projected the demand for flat steel products according to
two methods: a global approach and an end-use approach.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
5.       The global approach relates the use of flat steel to a macro-
economic variable (e.g. gross national product) in a simple regression,
or to a set of such variables in a multiple regression (say construction
activity and outpat of metal manufactures and engineering products). For
several reasons, only the simple correlation with gross national product
is likely to yield significant results in Turkey. Based essentially upon
this correlation and upon an assumed GNP growth of 7 percent per annum,
the UEC Study projected a 10 percent annual growth in total steel
demand. UEC further assumed that the proportion of flat steel to total
steel would remain more or less unchanged at 31 percent; hence demand for
flat steel would also grow by 10 percent per annum.
6.       The Bank Staff questions whether the global approach gives
good results in projecting steel consumption in developing countries nor,
for that matter, in industrialized countries 14 Nevertheless, it may
still be of some interest to show how Erdemir's market (in million tons
of finished steel) would grow on specified hypotheses g
1970      1980
Present base:  10 percent year (UEC)           .49      1.27
Present base:  11 percent per year             .49      1.39
Expanded base:  11 percent per year            .53      1.48
The assumed 11 percent growth rate corresponds to an elasticity of steel
demand in relation to gross national product of 11/7 - 1.57. According
to a study undertaken in the Bank in 19641, the elasticity of steel con-
sumption in relation to GNP in a cross-section comparison of 27 countries
was calculated as 1.9.  This analysis, however, is based upon a country
cross-section at a certain point of time. Taking into account a time
trend towards reduced steel consumption per unit of output, this figure
might fall to, say, 1.7. The same study observes that somewhere at a
per capita steel consumption of 30-40 kg (i.e. Turkey's present position),
conditions often seem to be met for an industrial take-off causing very
steep increases in steel demand. In fact, over a very short period of
time, per capita steel consumption may be lifted from the 30-40 kg level
to figures of 100 kg or higher. Against this background, the assumed 11
percent growth in steel demand may seem overly conservative.
One aspect alone may be noted. Although the proportion of flat steel
to total steel showed no definite trend in the past in Turkey, according
to the Company's assessment, this proportion would increase in the future.
Following UEC, all projections assume that Erdemir would absorb all but
30,000 tons of the total 1980 market, the balance being covered by imports.
In the first two calculations, absorption is included in the growth rate,
in the third calculation, absorption is added to the projected growth rate.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
C. Market Projection - End-use Approach
7.       The end use approach permits projection of demand not only in
aggregate terms but by consuming sectors and types of flat steel. It is
therefore an indispensible tool in sales strategy and in facilities and
production planning.
8.       A matrix of Erdemir's 1970 shipments of prime uality 21/ flat
products, by 11 categories of steel and 36 user categories is reproduced
in Table M 1. It is shown below in summarized form (thousand tons):

461.3
9.       In the following, the prospects for major individual markets will
be reviewed in turn and the results summarized in a final section.
D. Sectoral Projections
Railway Equipment
10.      Based upon the UEC study, the steel demand for railway equipment
may be tentatively projected as follows (in thousand tons):
1965    1970    1975    1980
Locomotives                                        2       4
Freight cars                                       6       6
Passenger cars and repairs                         2       -
n.a.     TY      io- -10
The proportion of prime quality products in Erdemir's output is now 89
percent. Assuming that this proportion would remain unchanged, our total
demand estimates will therefore be derived by dividing the figure for prime
products by 0.89.

11.      The Second Turkish Development Plan (1968-1972) projected an
annual growth rate for the machinery sub-sector of 22 percent per year.
The actual growth 1967-1970 was probably only about 13 percent. Never-
theless, this sector has received priority attention by the Turkish
Planning Office, and production should expand rapidly for three reasons:
-  growing domestic and export demand, particularly sub-
contracting for Common Market countries
- considerable scope for improved utilization of present
manpower and equipment resources
- substantial inventory of approved projects qualifying
for various industrial incentives.
The study projects the following growth in gross output values Y
1969     1972     197?
TL million, readjusted      1,640    2,855    7,510
adjusted        1,640    2,655    6,660
Index                         100       165      430
Interpolating and extrapolating on a linear trend yields indices of 350
for 1975 and 620 for 1980.
12.      Assuming that flat steel consumption by steel fabricators and
machinery makers would grow pari passu. with their increased production,
we arrive at the following demand figures (thousand tons):
197     1975    1980
24      84      145
Accepting the above figures as suitable targets, some lag in implementation
may reasonably be foreseen. Hence, the theoretical targets were reduced by
25 percent which yields the following adjusted figures:
/ Roughly adjusted to avoid double-counting with motor vehicle industry.
Specifically, the expected production from the Perkins engine project
and the Eaton-Yale-Towne and MKEK gearbox projects was deducted.

Automotive Industry
13.      The present sheet consumption in the automotive industry is mainly
for trucks and buses. The proximate outlook for this industry is somewhat
bleak. In 1970/71 there was a remarkable decrease in sales due to very
substantial price increases for the vehicles, reported to total over 50
percent (devaluation effect, increase in sales and production taxes).
Higher operating costs for motor vehicles (e.g. increased prices for motor
fuels) may also have held back sales.
14.      The Turkish Government has initiated several measures to improve
truck and bus sales in the short run (mergers of companies to reduce costs,
prohibition for Government agencies and the military to purchase vehicles
under foreign credits, increased export promotion, etc.).  Moreover, over
the long run, the production oftrucks and buses should pick up in response
to both replacement needs and needs for additional transport capacity. The
following progression has been assumed (thousand units):
1962    1967    1969    1972    1977    1982
Trucks                     14.8      7.5    12.7    12.8    15.8      20
Buses                        3.3    2.0      2.1     3.8      4.9      7
Flat steel requirements                     22      30       48       75
(thousand tons)
15.      The production of passenger cars and light pick-ups is expected to
increase rapidly as the new Tofas and Renault factories swing into production.
S.P.o. has indicated the following preliminary production schedules (thousand
vehicles):
1969    1971    1972    1977    1982
Tofas   )    -       5       25      45o1
Renault )    -
The attainment of these targets may be jeopardized by the proposed high
sales prices, e.g. TL 62,000, or over $4,000 equivalent.  Nevertheless,
using the above production figures, an estimated demand for flat steel of
560 kg per unit, and assuming furthermore that Renault would import
deepdrawn body parts until 1975 and that the two companies would share the
market equally, one arrives at the following steel consumption tonmages
(figures in thousand tons; mainly 0.5 mm sheets in deepdrawing quality):
1971    1972    1977    1982
1       7      25      62



AMNEX 1

This does not take into account the planned entry of a third manufacturer
who would produce light pick-up trucks and passenger vehicles for export.
If these plans are confirmed, it might be appropriate to add 50 percent to
the above totals 1972-1982.
Shipbuilding
i6.      The Ishikawajima Heavy Industries participation with the Turkish
Maritime Bank in a new shipyard is apparently moving ahead. In the first
phase  the capacity would be about 150,000 dwt per year (corresponding to,
say, six tankers or other bulk cargo vessels, or two general cargo ships).
The now shipyard has not yet given Erdemir a clear view of its flat steel
requirements. Tentatively, in consultation with the Company, the following
figures were used adding the new shipyard's demand to the present demand
(figures in thousand tons):
1965    1971    1974    1977    1982
12      29      62      112
if, in a second phase, the new shipyard turns to the production of very
large tankers, much of Erdemir's market might fall out since (according to
the UEC Study) the company does not presently contemplate producing the
very wide plates required (4.5-5 meters). The maximum width of plate
produced on the present combination mill is about 98 inches, cut edge (about
2.5 metres).
Household and Commercial Appliances
17.      This group includes refrigerators, washing machines, LPG stoves,
gas heaters and steel furniture. Domestic sales of refrigerators and
washing machines apparently increased 2-2.5 times 1968-1971.   The
market is now becoming partly saturated, and rather less than a 50 percent
increase is predicted for 1971-74. On this basis, steel demand might
grow as follows (thousand tons):
1970    1974    1978
Our estimate         34      51      68

Water, Gas and Electric Pipe
18.      This is the largest of all end uses.  Turkey has three manufacturers
of welded pipes and tubes, all of whom are located quite close to Eregli,
plus one small manufacturer of welded electric conduit pipe. Their present
combined capacity for longitudinal and spiral-welded tubes is estimated at
260,000 tons Y . Details are not presently available regarding the distribution
Mannesmann (130,000) Boru Sanayii (90,000), Umran Spiral (10,000) and
Yucel Boru (30,000). In addition these manufacturers have facilities to
process cold-rolled coils as follows: Mannesmann (3,000), Bora Sanayii
(10,000), Yucel Boru (6,000).

of total pipe and tube demand by categories, e.g. major water and gas
pipe lines, irrigation pipe, city water and gas distribution system,
petroleum and chemicals industry, etc.  At the present moment, Erdemir
supplies about one third of the pipe and tube market's demand as hot-
rolled coils and twothirds as skelp. The proportion may change in the
future since the tube manufactarers are adding their own slitting facilities,
in spite of Erdemirts relatively low price for skelp.
19.      The potential market for water pipe is very large.  Today only
30 percent of Thrkeyts 45,ooo villages have an organized waber supply.
20.      In the oil and gas sector, two major projects are under discussion:
a natural gas pipe line from Iraq via Bataan through Ankara to Istanbul and
an oil pipe line from Iran to Iskenderun. Each line would require about
400,000 tons of steel, but the manufacturing of the plate in Turkey for
this huge demand narrowly spaced intime would hardly be an economic proposi-
tion. On the other hand, the main gas line would have several branch lines,
requiring large steel tonnages which could be supplied by Erdemir. There
is also some discussion of an oil product line from one of the refineries
to Ankara. Moreover, if a gas line is constructed, the demand for LPG
bottles (presently 14,000 tons) would be vastly larger.
21.      Pending decisions with respect to the gas line, we have projected
the following minimum growth (thousand tons):
1964    1965    1970    1975    1980
362             101      155     239
22.      There is a large export market in the Middle East for tubes and
pipes of every kind. Turkish manufacturers have made studies of this
market and initiated certain export transactions. If present export incen-
tives are retained, this could develop into a major market for Erdemir
steel.
E. Summary of Sector Projections
23.      The demand estimates for individual sectors have been summarized
in Table M 2,       Footnotes to that table indicate growth assumptions for
sectors not specifically discussed above. The end results are as follows,
including second quality products:

F. Changes in the Specific Use of Steel
24.      The above estimates do not take into account the possibility of a
lower specific use of steel per unit of output resulting from factors such as:
- substitution of other materials (e.g. plastics and aluminum)
for steel
- improved (lighter) construction facilitated by the use of
more refined steels
- manufacture, in steel-consuming industries, of products
containing more labor and technology per unit of output
(and per kg of steel used).
A Swedish study indicates that specific steel use (steel consumption per dollar
of output) in Swedish engineering industries has fallen by about 1 percent per
year since World War II, corresponding to a reduction by one-half over 60-70 years.
This study, while stressing the large amount of guesswork involved in a projection,
expects this trend to accelerate so that the specific use of steel might be halved
again over 1970-2000. The main reasons quoted are the expected concentration of
Swedish engineering industries on higher-value products (using higher average
qualities of steel and incorporating a higher value added) and some substitution
of steel by plastics. This is in line with a 1967 prediction by Dr. J. Wallace,
Director of Research of Pressed Steel Fisher (United Kingdom) that, with an
increase in the output of motor vehicles, the total use of steel would begin to
decline by 1972, reflecting substitution of other materials for steel. While
this prediction may seem highly speculative, competition of aluminum with steel
for the canning market is a fact, and aluminum would appear to have an edge in
certain uses except perhaps as against extra-thin "double reduced" steel canning
stock which would not be made at Eregli. Etibank's new aluminum smelter is
expected to come into production by 1972 or earlier, and would be looking for an
initial market for 60,000 tons of aluminum ingots which is almost twice Turkey's
present consumption.
25.      Of course, there are also uses where steel could replace other materials,
like cast iron for radiators. Moreover, it seems clear that market growth in
recent years has been held back by short supplies.  Nevertheless, on balance,
it would seem realistic to count with some inroad on steel by other materials.
On the other hand, Turkey might benefit from export orders for steel fabricating
jobs, tanks, pressure vessels, etc. which would have a high steel content per
dollar of output. All things considered, there is insufficient evidence for
predictin& a reduction in the steel intensity of production in major steel-
using industries in Turkey. Rather, one might regard a one percent per year
drop in the specific steel use as the lower end of an estimating range, the
upper end of which would correspond to no reduction at all in that specific uae.

G. Eventual ELimination of Steel Shortages and Further Export Development
26.      The company comnenting on the above analysis has made two general
points:
a)  Steel consumption today is severely restricted by the
supply shortage. Turkish manufacturers wishing to
export finished products are unable to cover their steel
requirements.
b)  Although it is not possible to pinpoint the main areas
of attack, Turkey should be capable of developing export
markets for products containing steel at a more rapid
rate than implied by the Bank's analysis.
There is considerable logic to this argument, and it is appropriate to
present the market forecast as a range of possibilities, corresponding to
the following alternatives:
Altemnative 1 - Present steel intensity. No explicit account
improved supply availability.
Alternative 2 - Reduced steel intensity. No explicit account
improved supply availability.
Alternative 3 - Reduced steel intensity. Consideration given
increased availability of steel and export
industry demand 1976-80.
H. Conclusions
27.      Summarising the above analysis, the following growth in flat steel
demand has been projected (thousand tons):

special imported grades (540), rather than in relation to Erdemir's market
share (510).

It should be repeated that this estimate is subject to the assumption of
an overall cumulative growth rate of 7 percent per year in the Turkish gross
national product.

ANNEX 2
MAJOR TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC TRENDS IN STEEL PRCDUCTION
Present Structure of World Steel Industry
The 1969 world steel output is estimated at about 570 million tons
of crude steel. Three major producing areas - Western Europe, USSR -
Eastern Europe, and North America - produced 138 - 158 million tons each or
altogether 440 mOillion tons, Another 82 million tons were supplied by Japan,
15 million tons by the Peoples Republic of China and 11 million tons by
Australia and South Africa, leaving only 22 million tons for the developing
countries outside Europe. Most of the latter wax produced in Latin America
(11.7) and India (6.5).
More than 45 million tong of steel were exported in 1968 (excluding
intra-ECSC trade of 16.5 million tons). The ECSC area accounted for 18.4
million tons and Vapan for 12.8 million tons of this total, leaving close
to 15 million tons for all other principal exporting countries. More than
two-thirds of this trade was between industrialized countries leaving about
14 million tons imported. by developing countries valued perhaps (as a rough
guess) at about US$2 billion o.i.f.
Developing countries are important supplirs of iron ore to the
world's steel industry, as may be seen from the following summary of 1968
production of iron ore and 1975 projected production and export capabilities.

In 1968, about 44% of the iron ore used by the major steel making centers
was domestic ores whlle another 20% came from the neighboring areas of
Canada and Scandinavia. By 1975, the percentage of domestic ores may have
fallen to about 36% and the Canada-Scandinavia contribution to about 16%.
Ifearly one-half would then come from "overseas" sources.
j/ This annex is based on information available in mid 1970.  It has not been up-
dated to reflect changes occu.rring since that time. Although significant varia-
tions have occurred in the interim (particularly in areas of cost, scale of
operations, and other detail), the annex clearly brings out basic considerations
and issues pertinent to the project.



ANNEX 2

In contrast, industrialized countries as a group are largely
independent of imports for the other major material for the steel indus-
try, metallurgical coking coal. The United States is by far the world's
largest exporter, including exports to the most important steel producers
among the developing countries.
Organization of World Steel Industry
In industrialized countries, there is a strong tendency towards
production in large and modern units.  In 1968, seventeen concerns, with
outputs ranging from 6.1 million tons of crude steel (Hoesch, Germany) to
29.4 million tons (U.S. Steel) accounted for about two-thirds of the com-
bined steel production of the United States, European Coal and Steel Ccm-
munity, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The Broken Hill Company in Australia
is the only other steel maker (outside the Communist Bloc) with an annual
production exceeding 6 million tons.
Most of these large concerns operate several plants. Even in 1965,
plants producing ore than 0.5 million tons of crude steel accounted for
85% of the total steel-making capacity. The smaller plants make mainly
bars and rods or special steels. The overwhelming proportion of flat steel
is probably produced in plants with a crade steel capacity of 2.5 million
tons or over. All major new plants are being located on the ocean where
coal and ore can be received under favorable conditions in giant bulk
carriers.
Cost Structure in Steel
The cost structure for steel is analyzed below with reference to
the steel industry in Europe, the worldb largest steel exporting region.
Taking as a point of departure a normal average price for flat-rolled steel
of, say, $125 per ton, we may assume furthermore that this steel is produced
in a plant with total net assets valued at $150 per ton of crude steel, or,
say, $200 per ton of rolled steel Y Under these assumptions, the cost
structure might be somewhat as follows:
Iron ore and scrap                              16
Coking coal and other fuels                     19
Other raw materials minus byproduct credit       5
Raw Materials                           40
Wages and Salaries                              27
Depreciation (15 years life)                    18
Return on investment @ 12%                      24
Other and margin of error                       16
Conversion Margin                       85
TOTAL                           125
We may further assume that gross fixed costs would bq $270/ton of rolled
steel and net fixed assets (after depreciation) $1501ton and net current
assets $50 per ton.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
According to this estimate, the major raw materials which would be
available in most places of the world at a rather similar combined Cost
would account for about one-third of the total cost. The other two-thirds
represent the conversion margin which is eminently subject to four influences:
- variations in factor prices
- economies of scale
- comparative efficiencies in production
- altermative tschnologies
If our figures are correct, capital charges are roughly 50% higher
than manpower charges in the conversion margin of the European steel indus-
try. Under favorable circumstances, a steel plant would cost no more to
build in a developing country than in an industrialized country but the cost
of funds would be., say, at least one-quarter to one-third higher. Hence,
if one could assume equal efficiencies of capital and labor, the higher
capital charges (0.25 times 42 - $10.50) would be roughly offset if wages
and salaries averaged about 40% less than in Europe (0.40 times 27 - $10.80).
For most developing countries, the edge in average wage and salary
rates is substantially greater. Their difficulties and problews lie in:
(i) meeting the assumption of equal investment costs for
a plant of a given size;
(ii) attaining reasonable economies of scale;
(iii) attaining reasonable efficiencies of conversion; and
(iv) keeping abreast of technological change.
A fifth problem - the possibility that world export prices for
steel would tend to reflect marginal pricing (i.e. would be below average
costs, including a reasonable return, to efficient producers) is, re believe,
more than offset by the cost of shipping steel from Europe or Japan to
developing countries.
With respect to wages and salaries, two observations may be relevant.
First, a large proportion of the manpower in steel mills (in fact, nearly
one-half) is engaged in various auxiliary activities (maintenance, transport,
auxiliary activities, and administration). It would be intereating to study
whether economies of scale are more or less important in these supporting
activities than in the direct production departments. Secondly, as might be
expected, though the proportion of staff to wage-earners is higher in modern
mills than in old mills, the difference is not very great (the staff repre-
senting less than 15% of the total work force in a modern German steel mill).
Economies of Scale
The U.N. Economic Cowmission for Latin America, a few yearg ago,
made a study of economies of scale in integrated steel mills. Their report



ANNEX 2
Page 4
suggests that, at the time of the stu4., scale economies for bar and rod
mills would be pretty wel exhausted at an output of 500,000 tons of
finished steel while they would be significant for flat product mills Up to
a level of about 1,500,000 tons, illustrating the well-known difference
between the production of bars and rods as contrasted with the production
of medium plate and sheets in modern high capacity strip mills. A level of
500,000 tons would probagly also be economical for an integrated 4-high
modern heavy plate mill (example - the Swedish Oxelosund Works) but tbis
would require a large market for such plate. According to the ECLA. figures,
manpower requirements per ton of steel bars and rods at an annual production
of 500,000 tons would be only 35% of the corresponding requirements in a
plant built to produce 100,000 tons.  In integrated flat products millB,
manpower requirements at a production of 2 million tons would only be 45%
of the corresponding requirez.nts for a 500,000 ton mill.
The easiest way to summarize this is probably the observation
that under the assumptions made with respect to interest, profit, and wage
rates, the combined manpower and capital costs for a 500,0oo ton integrated
bar and rod mill would be about $30 per ton less than for a 100,000 ton mill
and the combined charges for a 2 million ton strip mill about $28 per ton
less than for a 0.5 million ton mill. This might be compared with selling
prices in the range of $1004125 per ton and "conversion margins" (cost
above materials) in the range of $60-$80 per ton.
Though we have not seen a critical review of the ECLA. figures, the
assumption with respect to the optimum size of bar and rod mills would seem
in rough correspondence with the present scale of production in European
mills. In an article appearing in a U.S. technical journal as recently as
October 1969, "selection and sizing of a large integrated steel plant" was
based on an assumed output of about 2.2 million tons of crude steel (1.6
million tons of finished flat steel products). The same article gives the
"economic size range" of major steel industry facilities as follows:
Size of Unit      Annual Output
Tons          Million Tons
Coke oven                      660 - 1,000         0.25 - 1.75
Blast furnace                                      1.0  - 1.7
Direct reduction (Armco)                           0.18 - 0.36
Basic oxygen converter         115 -   300         1.1  - 2.8  (2 furnaces, 1
operating)
Electric furnace               100 -   200         0.23   0.46 (using 60% pre-
reduced pellets)
The possibility of producing crude steel at a competitive price at a low
volume of output would seem from the above suimary to be intimately tied
to the economics of the direct reduction - electric furnace combination as
compared with the classical blast furnace - converter process.
The figures quoted in the previous paragraphs must be taken with
great reservations. As recently as 1965, the following proportions of aIl



ANNEX 2
Page 5
steel were produced in plants of over 2 million tons of crude steel capacity:
1. Canada              78%
2. United States       68%
3. Japan               54%
4. ECSO                35%
5. UK                  23%
Given the hectic merger and concentration movement in Western Europe and
the rapid growth in Japanese steel output, it would not be surprising if
at least two-thirds of their output today were produced in plants of over
2 million tons crude steel capacity. In the U.S., new steel-making shops
today seem to be built to the 4-5 million ton level while in Western Europe
and Japan, plants now on the drawing board are aimed at a production of
10 million tons on ocean-side locations. Apparently, significant economies
of scale will be realized well beyond the two-million ton level.
Comparative Efficiencies in Steel Production in Industrialized
and Developung Couries
The dynamics of steel production in industrialized countries vis
well illustrated by the Kawasaki Steel Corporation, a substantial borrower
from the IBRD and essentially a producer of flat steel (plates and sheets).
During the 1960s, the companys crude steel production rose from 2.1 million
tons to 6 million tons, now produced mainly in the Chiba works with an end
- 1969 crude steel capacity of 6.5 million tons and in the new Misushima
works, with an-end - 1969 capacity of 4.5 million tons which will be raised
to 8 million tons at the end of the present eonstruction phase. During tis
expansion, the book value of the compaz0s assets per ton of crude steel 3
rose from only about $175 per ton at the beginning of the period to $90 per
ton (the undepreciated value would be about $40 per ton higher). The employ-
ment per thousand tons of crude steel equivalent fell drastically from 11.4
men in 1960-61 to 3.5 men in 1969-70. Together, these figures explain the
reduction in the company's average selling price from $112.54 per ton of
crude steel to $96.44 per ton - it is fair to assume that there were also
verg important quality improvements during the decade (i.e. a higher propor-
tion of cold-roll4d steel).
It is a reasonably safe guess that few, if any, steel concerns in
developing countries have come close to matebing Kawasakits record. The
efficiency gap between competitive producers in industrialized countries
and the vast bulk of steel producers in developing countries probably
widened during the last decade. The following factors may explain such a
trend:
2/  In Japan, the dynamics was provided through the growth of the economy;
in Europe, mainly through restructuring, including many mergers.
Kawasaki's shipments of finished products in 1969-70 were aboat 75% of
the company's crude steel production.

- High investment costs for planto procured under tied
aid; such as Erdemir Steel in Turkey. While some of
the difference reflects the lower initial value of
output, a large share reflects the bigher costs of
tied aid procurement.
- Failure of steel companies in developing countries
(for a number of operational, financial or institu-
tional jl reasons) to push rapidly towards higher
levels of output; Somisa (Argentina), Ensidesa (Spain),
Paz del Rio (Colombia), and several other cases could
be cited.
- Absence of a competitive environment; in most cases,
the new steel companies have been protected monopolies.
In some cases, State management may have been an
additional handicap, though it is admittedly difficult
to prove how much better private enterprise would have
done in a given situation.
Outlook for Steel Making Materials
In western Europe, in 1965-1968, the consumption of iron ore per
ton of finished steel averaged slightly above 0.8 tons (Fe content) with
a coking coal consumption of approximately one ton of coking coal per ton
of finished steel. During the 1960's the general trend was towards lower
prices for iron ore and an edging upward of prices for coking coals, as may
be seen from the following sumnary:
1960     1965     1970
Swedish iron ore: cif ECSC port       12.75    10.90      8.60
Coking coal at mine, Ruhr             15.30    17.40    20.20 (lst half)
Together, tbese price changes more or less offset one another,and had only
a minor effect upon the cost of steel production.
A major factor behind the lower iron ore prices (apart fron a
temporary expansion in iron ore supplies as compared with demand) was the
revolution in bulk cargo movement Which probably largely explains the
fall in iron ore frbi&ts Brazil - Rotterdam from 43s. 9d. in 1960 to
l7s.,5d. in 1967. For a 10,000 mile journey, the tranoport cost in a 30,000
dwt bulk carrier is now estimated at $10 per ton; the corresponding cost
for a 200,000 dwt vessel would be only $4.50 per ton. The trend towards
large vessels has not been fully consummated. Thus, in January 1970, the
Swedish Grangesberg Company, one of the world's leading iron ore shippers,
ordered two combined ore/coal carriers, both rated at 266,000 tons dwt.
with a total crew of 60 men these two carriers represent a tonnage more than
three times the whole of the 1950 Grangesberg fleet, numbering 19 carriers
with a total crew of 675.
1 e.g, the Indian decision to build several new steel mills in preference
to expansion at existing sites.



ANNEX 2
Page 7
The world resources of iron ore are enormous, bat a temporary
shortage in the medium term future cannot be ruled out. Iron ore mining
is highly capital intensive, particularly if complementary railroad port
facilities  are taken into consideration.  Financing, therefore, may well
turn out to be a problem.
Coal requirements could beoome a more serious bottleneck. Though
world coal reserves are estimated at 4.6 trillion tons, less than 1 trillion
are classified as coking coals, and only about one-half of these would normally
be considered metallurgical grade - with less than 1.25 percent sulphur
and less than 8 percent ash. Even after considering a continuing sharp
decline in the coking coal requirements per ton of iron, it is estimated
that world exports of coal would need to be increased from 136 million tons
in 1969 to more than 210 million tona by 1980. This will cause some diffi-
culties since mine expansion has to be planned several years ahead and since,
for reasons of pollution, public utilities are becoming increasingly inter-
ested in high-volatile, low sulphur and low ash coals which are also used
for blending with premium grade metallurgical coking coals in producing
blast furnace coka. The general energy price level is also being pushed up
through inflationary wage increases in the U.S. coal mining industry and
recent sharp price increases for Middle East crude oil. In conclusion, an
increase in the price of American coking coal from a recently projected
level of $12 per ton to a new freely predicted level of $18 would necessitate
an increase in steel prices by a roughly equal amount to which must be added
cost increases for the industry's fuel and energy requirements other than
in the blast furnace.  If "direct" reduction were to be introduced on a large
scale, the prospects would be somewhat brighter, since direct reduction does
not require high-grade metallurgical coking coal, but direct reduction is,
perhaps, unlikely to become a major faotor inflnuencing steel prices during
the present decade.
Future Developments in Technology
No revolutionary developments are anticipated in irmn and steel
metallurgy over the next decade. The blast furnace is likely to retain
its position as the primary vehicle for iron production. Cost reduction
through larger furnaces and a faster reduction cycle will be harder to
come by. The optimum size of blast furnaces rose gradually from a 2 m
diameter in 1870 to 8 m in 1950 and then rose very quickly to about 14 m
today. Only a few years ago, the 10 largest Japanese blast furnaces all had
diameters within the range of 10-11 m.
The iron output from the best furnaces in the world today varies
from 50 to 68 tons per 24 hours and m2 of furnace area; it could probably
be raised to 85 tons, i.e. about 25% above the present peak performance.
This would result both from a more rapid throughput of the burden and a
larger volume of iron per unit of coke (i.e. more efficient reduction). A
well operated 14 m furnace would then have a daily output of 15,000 tons,
i.e. on the order of 5.5 million tons per year with a total fuel consumption
of 470 kg of coke equivalent. Such a development would call for further



ANNEX 2
Page B
improvement in ore and coke qualities, more sophisticated furnace profiles,
higher blast te_peratures, oxygen injection, and higher top pressures.
Continued progress in automation and instrumentation would also be needed.
The difference between producing, say, 50 tonWo m2/day in a 7.5 meter farnace
and 85 tons/m2/day in a 14 meter furnace translates into a conversion cost
difference as between $25 and $16 per ton. The potential for further
improvement suggests that only several years from now when major steel pro-
ducing nations have reached a technical ceiling will developing countries
start closing the gap in iron conversion costs.
However, this dowe xot take into account the possibility that the
direct reduction method may become fully competitive with the blast furnace.
The direct reduction method is well adapted to developing countries since
it is not as dependent upon economies of scale. Furthermore, it is probably
easier to operate and is more flexible in terms of expansion of production.
If one looks to certain developing countries as future suppliers of iron or
crude steel to the world market, they would have a comparative advantage as
compared with iron produced in Japan or Western Europe in the following re-
spects: cheap natural gas might be used as the reduction fuel and instead
of shipping 1-1 2 tons of iron ore, the equivalent could be shipped as
roughly one ton of granulated iron or pro-reduced pellets.
A recent study shows that, in the United States, a combination of
direct iron reduction with electric furnaces would show lower production
costs under certain conditions, than a "claasical" combination of blast
furnace-oxygen converter. This estimate was based on a price for natural
gas of $0.20/mof (i.e. a very low price) and a price for electric power of
7 mills per kwh. A major reason for the superiority of the direct reductioin
electric furnace alternative was the assomed gradual build-up of production
to the ultimate level of 2.2 million tons of crude steel equivalent. The
scales are tipped in favor of conventional technology, if one assumes that
there would be an immediate market for 2 million tons of steel and if one
could take the risk of buildlng one 5,100 ton/day blast furnace instead of
two 2,550 toi day (e.g. if system reliability could be assured through another
furnace within the same concern). One important condition when using an
electric furnace combination is an assured supply of power; thus, in the
example chosen in the study, five 80-ton, 75,000 KVA furnaces would be
used with a combined peak demand of 180 Mv.
Crude steel production today is dominated by the oxygen converter.
From lesa than 10% of total world steel output in the late 195018, oxygen
conversion now accounts for over one-third of the total steel output, a
share that is expected to increase to two-thirds by 1980. Most of the
oxygen steel in Western Europe and Japan is produced in vessels of 100 tons
or above while in developing countries the bulk of the installations are 75
tons and below. The largest converters presently in operation have a
capacity of 350 tons, enough for an output of over h million tons of steel
per year. Hence, further major increases in size are not to be expected.
Moreover, the difference in conversion cost for steel between a  15-ton
converter and a 300-ton converter, according to the ELCA study already quoted,
would be only about $2/ton, with a further $2/ton increase if a 55-ton
furnace were used.



ANNEX 2
Page 9
Since economies of scale in individual iron and steel producing
units are likely to become exhausted within the next decade, further gains
could come only from a more continuously flowing operation - no matter
whether the blast furnace/oxygen converter route or the direct reduction/
electric furnace route is chosen. It was already pointed out that a substantial
portion of manpower requirements in steel mills is accounted for by transport
and maintenance work, etc. Changes are possible in both systems through con-
tinuous operations which would eliminate many awkward, discontinuous and heavy
movements of bulky materials. In this way, total investment cost in steel
production might be reduced by about one-third, with accompanying major reduc-
tions in manpower cost. This type of change is likely to be gradual. Such new
sophisticated and possibly capital-intensive systems are likely to be intro-
duced more rapidly in industrialized countries thus helping them to maintain
their competitive edge.

ANNEX 3
ECOLOGY
General
1.        Steel plants are frequently criticized for air and water pollution
in the form of dust, smoke and obnoxious fumes, and the discharge of oils9
chemicals and other wastes. The Company has already solved many of its pollu-
tion problems but others are left. A provision of $5.0 million has been
included in the project cost estimate as a general provision for anti-pollution
equipment. It is expected that a new undersea outfall (to carry liquid
effluent about 4,ooo ft. out in the Black Sea) would be used in conjunction
with chemical treatment, sedimentation, oil skimming, and improved collection
facilities for liquid wastes.
2.        Air pollution in the form of dust will be reduced through the use of
improved venturi scrubbers and bag house filter units at the B.O.Fo shop and
lime kilIn respectively.
3.        Higher smoke stacks will be utilized at the power plant and lime kiln
to reduce concentrations of obnoxious gases at ground level.
L.        Smokes gas and dust emission at the coke plant will be reduced through
the use of design improvements such as self-sealing doors, quenching tower
baffles, improved charging systems, aspirators and smoke seal boxes.
5.       The items mentioned above are tentatively included in the project,
sibject to more detailed engineering review. The selection of these items
for inclusion in the project is in basic agreement with the recommendations of
a team of professional ecologists hired by the Bank to study ecological aspects
of the Erdemir Project.
6.        Erdemir is now making an assessment of further specific needs, the
costs of which would be covered under the local currency project budget, and
the budget for routine capital expenditures.
Air Pollution
(a) Dust
7.        Serious dust generation can result from BOF and blast furnace opera-
tions, and to a lesser degree, from calcining and sgne material storage and
handling operations. The company is recovering most dust through measures
common in more industrialized countries, but improvement in some areas is still
necessary. Such improvements are included in the project. No major dust
problems for nearby communities are expected, except possibly during some
unusual breakdowns or process irregularities. Other normal plant dust is
essentially confined to the plant area.
(b) Noise
8.        Some excessive noise results from plant processes such as pickling
operations, rolling mills, and the calcining plant. Additional gas handling
equipment at the calcining plant (in the project) should also reduce noise.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
Most noise problems are inside the plant and do not affect the surrounding
area. In-plant noise is reduced as far as possible to safeguard employee
health.
(c) Smoke and Fumes
9.        A potentially troublesome release of sulfur diaxide fumes into the
atomosphere from the sinter plant now under construction will be alleviated by
a 160 m. high stack which is expected to adequately reduce S02 concentrations
at ground level. Sulfur dioxide emissions also result from power plant opera-
tions, primarily due to burning of high sulfur fuel oil. Emissions from this
source will be made less troublesome by use of higher plant stacks. Some smoke
and fumes from the coke plant cannot be avoided in the general area of the
plant at present levels of technology and eqpipment design, although measures
included in the project should reduce emissions to an important degree. Some
normal generation of smoke can be expected from coke plant charging and pushing
operations and irregularities and changeovers of fuels on various plant burners
and combustion systems. Such occurrences, however, should happen only periodi-
cally and are not expected to cause any continued serious nuisance to the
community. Present indications show little or no apparent damage to crops,
plants, trees and livestock from air pollution in areas near the plant.
Water Pollution
10.       Picle line waste liquor (dilute contaminated sulfuric acid, H2S04) i
now dumped directly into the Black Sea with little or no neutralization or other
treatment. While the exact effect on local marine life is not known, this is a
severe poIlutant, and the Company is planning to install facilities for acid
recovery, neutralization and/or use of the undersea outfall mentioned in
paragraph 1.
11.       Some mill service water is now recirculated with minimal effect of
undesirable effluent. Other systems of mill service water dump directly into
a sall canal leading to the sea. This effluent normally contains some oil,
grease, and suspended solids. It would be difficult and costly to avoid such
dumping altogether, but the Company plans to process such water in an oil
skimming system prior to dumping into the undersea outfall.
12.       Port operations can be expected to cause some water pollution as
ships dump various wastes at or near the harbor; the plant could provide some
ship services to minimize this form of poIlution, but the results will be
dependent mainly on practices of individual shipping lines and enforcement of
legal provisions in Turkey.
13.       Thermal pollution, resulting from reject heat from plant operations
is believed to present 'Very little problems, since the Black Sea can easily
absorb the quantity of heat required, with negligible effect on local or
general temperature levels.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
Agreement
14.       The Company has agreed to present a specific plan acceptable to the
Turkish Government and the Bank for dealizg with air and water pollution, and
to implement the specific plan prior to completion of the project. The
specific plan to be followed will be based on the recommendations of the pro-
fessional ecologists previously hired by the Bank.

THE SUPPLY OF IRON ORE AND COAL FOR ERDEMIR
General
1.        The availability, quality and cost of the two major raw materials
for iron and steel production, iron ore and coking coal, is of outstanding
importance to the economics of any integrated steel project. In 1970, cost
of coal and iron ore used were nearly one-third of Erdemir's sales.  Until
now, virtually all the coal and iron ore have come from domestic sources.
The cost of domestic ore and coal, therefore, have a major bearing upon the
competitiveness of the company's operations.
Erdemir's Cost of Iron Ore and Coal, 1970
TL Million      Per Cent
Sales                            1,105.0          100.0
Value of Iron Ore Used             198.9           18.0
Value of Coal Used                 155.1           14.0
Total Iron Ore and Coal Used       354.o           32.0
2.        In addition to iron ore and coal, the company uses many other
purchased materials and services, including fluxes, steel scrap, ferro-
alloys, tin, fuel oil, purchased power, sulfuric acid, stools, rolls, molds
and spare parts. In 1970, the cost of these inputs totalled TL 234 miJllion.
For various reasons (mainly lmport duties and tied local procurement),
Erdemir appears to have a cost disadvantage in tin, sulfuric acid, and molds
and stools which, as a rough order of magnitude, adds some 7 per cent to the
cost of sundry materials and services if compared with international prices.
Requirements of Iron Ore and Coal
3.        The prospective requirements for coal and iron ore are related
below to the Coapany's projected maximum output of crude steel after
implementation of Stage I of the expansion program and Stage II.

Coal Requirements                         770    1,6648   max 2,000
The figures assume that both the two blaBt furnaces and the B.O.F. steel
shop would be operated to capacity by 1980, using in 1980 100 percent foreign
or equivalent ores. This is higher than the figures used in the financial
projections; according to the latter, iron production would be likely to
be maximized at 1.65-1.71 million tons and steel production at 1.77 million
tons, due to assumed use of predoinnantly domestic ores.
Iron Ore - Supplies and Costs
4.        The following figures give an approximate idea of the likely iron
ore supply and price pattern for 1971. Details for 1970 are shown in

ANNEx 4
Page 3
The table calls for the following comments:
a. The quality of the Turkish ores is adequate; the
high SiO2 content of the Karakuz fraction
(12.8% SiO2) could be helpful in removing some of
the high alumina and sulfur content in other
domestic ores with the slag;
b. The average physical composition of the domestic
ore as received is very unsatisfactory for direct
blast-furnace charging, due to the high fines
content. When Erdemir's new sinter plant starts
operating in 1972, all ore will be crushed at a
proposed setting of 50 mm, and the fines will be
used to produce sinter;
c. Turkish ore would be roughly competitive with
imported ore on a pure price basis. Yet, the
higher iron content of foreign ore brings great
advantages in reducing coke consumption and
increasing the daily output of the blast-furmace.
5.       The cost advantage from using foreign ore (under the price and
quality assumptions indicated above) was explored in the UEC study at the
Bank's specific request. This is reflected in a comparison between two cases:
a. 'Domestic Ore" case. Foreign ores added only for
essential enrichment of the ore mix. This would
involve the use of 400,000 tons per year in 1974-75,
500,000 tons per year in 1976-1980. The foreign
ore share in the total iron content of Erdemir's
ore purchases would generally be in the range of
20-26 per cent.
b. "Foreign Ore" case. Exclusively rich foreign ores used.
6.       TABLE 14 shows a cost penalty (reduction in the company's profits
before taxes) from using Turkish ores in the period 1975-1980 varying
between 24 and 59 per cent of the total purchase value of that ore. 1/ It
seems clear that for Turkish ore to become conpetitive, an average reduction
in the ore price by at least one-third would be necessary.
7.       Turkish iron ore production has expanded from about 700,000 tons
per year in the early 1960's to about 2 million tons in 1969, approximately
1/ In addition, the domestic ore should probably be burdened with interest
and other storage charges occasioned by the need to provide a buffer for
a five/six-imnth period when the main domestic mines are closed because
of climatic conditions.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
covering the domestic requirements. About one-half of the production comes
from the State Divrigi mines operated by a subsidiary to the Karabuk steel
mill and the balance from 20-25 small mines supplying mainly Erdemir. The
central group of deposits (including Divrigi) contains most of the nation's
reserves and holds the greatest prospects for finding additional ores.
They have two disadvantages. They are far from the steel mills (about 840
km. by rail from Karabuk, 550 km. from the port of Samaun where the ore has
to be trans-shipped by sea another 491 km. to Eregli, and 550 km. by rail to
Iskenderun, for which the existing line has limited capacity) and mining
operations are presently carried out only six months of the year because of
cold climate in winter (see map).
8.        Assuming a domestic finished steel production of 4 million tons
by 1980, the requirements for domestic iron ore, if 25 per cent foreign ore is used
to sweeten the charge, would be close to 7 nmllion tons, baEis 52.4% Fe.
New developments sugge8t that it may be possible to supply this quantity, or
even more, by 1980. Karabuk has a project for expanding the rate of mining
at Divrigi from one to four milliJn tons and to build a one-million ton
pelletizing plant to process the fines accumulating in the mining process.
These plans would become operative if and when presently proven reserves of
100-million tons (Karabuk estimate) could be doubled. Meanwhile, huge
reserves of ore have been inferred at nearby Hasancelebi. Preliminary
figures indicate 400-million tons of ore averaging about 30% Fe which could
be easily processed (magnetic separation) to a concentrate of 60.8% Fe,
6.1% SiO2, 0.08% P, 0.03% S and 0.02% Al.
9.        According to the time schedule worked out by Karabuk, mining
operations at Hasancelebi could be initiated by 1974, the concentration and
pellet plant at Divrigi could be ready by 1975, and the Hasancelebi pellet
plant by the middle of 1977. A preliminary and tentative price indication
for Hasancelebi pellets has been given as $12.80 equivalent c.i.f. Eregli,
basis 60% Fe, including freight of $9.50. This corresponds to 21.3 cents
per unit Fe as compared with the import price assumed by UBC of $13.95 per
ton for 65.7% ore, or 21.2 cents per unit Fe. On this basis, in the late
1970's domestic ore would be competitive.
10.       These optimistic perspectives should be viewed with considerable
caution. Successful implementation of the above program would be subject
to several conditions:
a. Proving of inferred reserves at Divrigi and Hasancelebi;
b. A master plan for developing Turkey's iron ore deposits
which would, as far as possible, take advantage of the
sintering capacity now existing or being installed at the
three integrated steel mMills. The Hasancelebi concentrates
cannot be supplied to the sintering plants; being in the
form of fines, they must be pelletized before shipment;
c. Provision of the necessary storage and transport capacity
for the large ore movements envisaged. The capacity of



ANNEX

the Samsun railroad could apparently be increased quite
easily to 2 million tons, but the capacity of the
Iskenderun railroad iB limited and might become a bottle-
neck;
d. Settlement of ownership conditions. Large portions of the
Hasancelebi deposit are owned by the Bilfar firm which also
owns two of the three major mines supplying Erdedmir, namely
the Karakuz and Deveci mines. Most of the remaining area
apparently belongs to the Government;
e. Management of a major midning venture under the State Economic
Riterprise form;
f. Financing the new ventures. The smaller concentration
and pelletizing plant at Divrigi alone is costed at
close to $30 million equivalent.
11. *     The iron ore supply for Erdemir would present less of a problem
if it could be assumed that iron ore would be freely available on the world
market, and Erdemir would be provided with foreign exchange as needed for
rational forward planning. Neither of these conditions is fulfilled at the
present moment. In recent contracts, Erdemir has paid about 29.3 cents per
-nit Fe for 69.3% Itabira ore; it has also been offered 63.8% Liberian
pellets at 37.6 cents per unit. These prices would seem distinctly higher
than the world market level, reflecting premiums paid on relatively small
contracts as well as higher freight charges for ore shipped in relatively
small vessels. They are conpared below with prices under large-scale
contracts concluded by the Japanese steel industry. Japanese saipping costs
are low because of the use of very large vessels (on the order of 170,0C0
tons). Erdemir uses 40-50,000 ton vessels.

12.       Long-range planning of iron ore procurement is essential to the
smooth and economic operations of a steel mill. The Government has agreed to
permit Erdemir to enter into contracts for the importation of foreign ore.

Coal - Supplies and Costs
13.       Erdemir obtains most of its coal by ship from the Zonguldak coal
mine, which belongs to TKI, the State coal company. About 10 per cent is
railed from the Armutcuk mine very close to Eregli (see map).

/a   In July 1971 average coal prices per ton were raised to TL 330.
14.       Turkey recently sold coal to Japan and Italy at the very com-
petitive price of about $13.25, as seen from the following indicators:

15.       The favorable picture is modified by the July 1971 price increase
to 330 TL per ton of coal. This increase had become necessary because of
certain trends in Turkish coal mining, namely steeply rising wage costs,



ANNE 4

high operating losses, lagging development and managerial problems. A
price increase of about EL 40 per ton of coal or 23 per cent alone would
have been necessary to eliminate the 1970 operating loss, without allowance
for future cost increases, which, particularly for wages are expected to be
high in this and the next year. The following data give the general picture:

/a Including depreciation and interest.
16.       After the July 1971 price increase, Turkish coal is at a slight
disadvantage with imported coal, allowance made for its higher ash content
which results in lower coke yields and higher coke consmuption in the blast
furnace.

The above conparison does not take into account savings arising from an
estimated 8.5 per cent increase in blast furnace output when charging coke
made from imported coal. On the other hand, some future increase in inter-
national coal prices is predicted by many observers.
17.      The July 1971 price increase by 65 per cent to TL 330 per ton of
coal was also necessary to help the mines finance their considerable invest-
ment programs. Projected future investments at TKI mines are as follows:

18.      The main objectives of the overall investmnt program would be
the following:
a. Mechanization of some faces;
b. Replacement of jigging sstem with heavy media
separation, with a substantial increase in washing
capacity;
c. Opening of a now mine at Amasra (80-100 km. east
of Zonguldak), with separate washing facilities
and an expected initial production of 600 tcns/day
salable coal, to rise rapidly to 2,200 tons/day;

19.      The up1y of Turldah coal will be sufficient to meet the require-
ments Of the Turldsh steel industry. It is eopected that at the end of the
decade the Turkish steel industry il conma the bulk of the presently
projected output of 6.8 million tons of coal per year.

ANNEX 5
COST OF OPERLTIONS
General
1.     The term "cost of operations" denotes all costs involved in receiving
materials and other inputs, turning them into saleable products, and selling
and shipping thee final products. The main focus of this Annex, however, is
on (a) the number of equipment hours and manhours per unit of output, both in
direct prodmction departments and in auxiliary services like transportation,
general maintenance, etc., and (b) the cost of these hours.
2.    Given the prices for labor and equipment use, operating costs will be
determined by the following factors:
(a)    Economies of scale;
(b)    Degree of balancing of plant which will be constrained
by original facilities and market structure;
(c)    Capacity utilization;
(d)    Efficiency of operations which will depend upon the
availability and quality of management and labor, the
institutional framework, and the "learning curve",
i.e., the accumulated experience and know-how.
Economies of Scale, Capacity Utilization and Plant Balancing
3.     One of the major advantages of expansion is the extent to which it will
help reduce production costs per unit of output, both in production departments
and with respect to general overhead facilities, such as mill buildings, pipes,
roadways, port facilities, laboratory.  In the production departments, these
opportunities arise both because of the substantial reserve capacity in certain
existing facilitios (hot-rolled and cold-rolled shears, electrolytic cleaning
line, pickling liae, tandem cold-reduction mill, etc.) and because the capac-
ities of several units can be substantially increased with relatively minor and
inexpensive modifications.
4.     Normally in a steel plant, capacity is expressed in terms of ingot pro-
duction. In major industrialized countries, including Western Europe and Japan,
the average crude steel 'operating rate" (ratio of actual production to stated
capacity) over the last decade has been of the order of B0-90 per cent. This
is an almost inevitable result of cyclical fluctuations in demand. Reduction
in the operating rate may also be caused by strikes and equipment breakdown.
5.    The unique aspect of Erdwmir's operations is that crude steel-making
capacity itself, at least in the beginning, would not be a bottleneck,  Instead,
bottlenecks would be (a) in the combination mill until the new hot strip mill
comes into operation and later on in units like soaking pits and annealing



ANNEX 5
Page 2
furnaces which could be expanded to cope with riaing demand and (b) in blast
furnace ("hot metal") capacity   (Table 10). For that reason, even though the
utilisation of ingot capacity in 1975-1980 would be only 76-89 per cent, out-
put projections made by UEC are close to maximum attainable outputa. To take
into accovut losses in production due to cyclical fluctuations, strikes, etc.,
the operating rates assumed by UEC were reduced by about 5 per cent in the
financial projections. A 95 per cent operating rate on Erdemirts key (bottle-
neck) facilities may seem high compared to the 80-90 per cent rate achieved
in industrialized countries. Nevertheless, it has been adopted in the finan-
cial projections for two reasons:
(a)    Erdemir's market is likely to remain protected against
outside competition during the next decade while, on
the other hand, the company would have an opportunity
to export temporary excesses of production;
(b)    Over the next decade, the company is almost certain to
undertake additional investments over and above the pro-
ject; these investments are expected to be highly
productive.
Specific Assumptions with Respect to Operating Costs
6.    The operating costs shown in the financial projection are based on the
following assumptions:
(a)    The present blast furnace, relined to 29' 6", and the
new blast furnace would have capacities of 2,360 tons
of iron per day per furaace when operating on a mix
of 43 per cent of domestic ore, 39 per cent sinter,
12 per cent of foreign ore (Table 15). Based upon 350
operating days per furnace, this corresponds to 1,654,000
tons per year for the two furnaces combined. Each blast
furnace would be relined after six years of operation;
(b)    After the installation of the third Basic Oxygen Furnace,
the Steel Furnace Shop would have a capacity of about
2,850 tons per furnace per day with two of the furnaces
operating and the third undergoing refractory repairs or
kept in reserve. At 350 days, this corresponds to approx-
izately 2 million tons per year. This compares with a
present output of about 2,000 tons per furnace per day.
Present production is restrained by the shortage of oxygen,
but the attainment of the targeted 2,850-ton level would
also require substantial improvement in furnace-charging
practices. Nevertheless, the projected rates represent a
realistically attainable target;
(c)    The coke plant yields (tons of coke per ton of coal charged)
and steel furnace yields will remain more or less unchanged.
On the other hand, the blast furnace metallic yield would
increase from about 91.5 per cent at the present moment to
about 95 per cent, reflecting the use of sinter and other
improvments causing smaller losses of flue dust;



Page 3
(d)    As shown in Table Cl (attached to this Annex), rolling
yields for individual products are assumed to decline
dlghtly as compared with presentl;y achieved rates. This
will result fru efforts to bring Erdemir's product quality
more completely in line with European standards, so as to
provide "prime qualityt plates and sheets of consistent
high quality, particularly in terms of appearance, freedom
from damage in handling and packaging and care in coiling;
(e)    Reflecting the above assumptions, production would develop
according to the product plan shown in Table 10;
(f)    Total personnel is expected to grow  as follows:
Present   Projected   Increase
Corporate and Plant
Adwinistration             1,571   t,697             8%
Production                 1,138      1,675         47%
Services, Utilities,
Maintenance, Shipping      1,478       1,968       2AA
Total:      i,187      5,340        3
The direct production labor figures are close to the standards
for comparable facilities in the United States and assume
essentially only a continuation of present practices at Rrdemir.
At the same time they assume strict mnagerial controls and the
maintenance of successful labor relations with emphasis on
productivity. The effect on manpower productivity of these
assumptions is shown below:

1976-1980          9.5            8.3
(g)   Manpower remuneration, as shown in Table 23 averaged TL 3,655
per month for salaried personnel and TL 1, 934 for wage earners
in 1970. This is assumed in the financial projections to in-
crease by 18 per cent in 1971 and by three percentage points
annally thereafter. This reflects the assumption that the
17 Product mix in 1975 and later includes 300,000 tons/year of billets, uhich
require rqlatively few man hours per ton as compared with fully furnished
products (as tin plate).



ANNE= 5
Page 4
Turkish steel industry would have to meet wage increases
through increased productivity rather than through price
increases as has been the trend in Western Europe in the
recent past and is likely to remain true for the foreseeable
future.
(h)    Depreciation of equipment haa been based on an assumed
average 15-year economic life for the new installations.
Thia is in line with present practice in, e.g., U.K. and
Japan; a relatively high depreciation rate is necessary
because of rapidly developing technology.
7.     The operating coats arising from the above assumptions are summarized in
Chapter VIII, Paragraph 8.01.

2.        Substantial price increases for a wide range of domestic products
were approved by GOT in mid-1971, affecting coal, rail freights, tax on fuel
oil and electricity. These, together with a rise in salaries and wages
have increased Erdemir's cog1 of operations. The Company's selling prices,
which are controlled by GOTf and had remained unchanged since 1968, were raised
in July 1971 on an average by 25 per cent to offset Erdemir's cost increases
and also help finance its expansion program.
3.        The present Government policy is to permit steel imports only to
the extent that demand cannot be satisfied by domestic producers. With a
monopoly position for its flat products, Erdemir could charge a price suffi-
cient to yield an adequate return on its investment, but the Government haB
to take into account the possibly harmful effects upon the Turkish economy
of steel prices exceeding the international level.
4.        The Bank has consistently stressed the need for a reasonably
competitive price as a condition for lending.  It, therefore, becomes
necessary to compare Erdemir's prices with the alternative cost of importing
steel and with domestic prices in the European Common Market, with which the
Turkish economy is expected to start to become integrated within the life of

the prosent project. Such a comparison is also crucial in determining the
economic justification for the project (Chapter X).
Methodology for comparing Erdemir Prices with World Prices
5.        A comparison of Erdemir prices with world prices raises the
following issues of concept and methodology:
a. Import prices vs. domestic prices in the Common Market.
The main standard of comparison is with projected import
prices. The alternative standard, namely domestic prices
in the Common Market is relevant only in the context of
evaluating the damage done to Turkish export industries
through a high steel price. It might also become rel-evant
in the future if, after Turkey's association with the
Common Market, pricing rules were established which tied
Turkish prices to Common Market basing points (a somewhat
unlikely and not necessarily desirable arrangement) Y
Ideally, in-ternational division of labor should perhaps
occur strictly according to comparative advantage. Yet,
a country making a decision to enter the steel industry
would need to consider whether world market prices would
be either higher than justified by comparative advantage
(monopolistic pricing) or lower (due to "marginal cost"
pricing or export subsidies in whatever form). Its
essential guiding star should be the probable price, with
supply reliability as a subsidiary criterion. In one
respect, present prices for Common Market steel imported
into Turkey is not a good standard. A special discount
of $10 per ton is granted in the Eastern Mediterranean
area to meet competition from Eastern Europe. For the
present purpose, it is assumed that this discount is a
temporary phenomenon and has been disregarded.
b. Point of delivery. The ultimate cost of steel to the
Turkish consumer is represented by the landed price for
imported steel or the price f.o.b. Eregli, plus inland
or coastal transportation. The Bank asked the company to
compare its actual outbound freights on steel shipments
with the inland or coastal freights which would have been
1/ With a view to an orderly and transparent price system, ateel prices in
the United States and in Western Europe are generally quoted f.o.b.-
selected basing points,with a freight charge added from the basing point
to final destination, independently of whether or not this corresponds
to the actual physical movement of the ateel.

payable on imported steel. This comparison showed average
outbound freights of IL 75.14 per ton on actual shipments
from Eregli, as  oompared with hypothetical freights of
TL 63.75 per ton from the port of Istanbul. The latter
charge may be a slight over-statement since some steel
could presumably be imported directly to Izmir or Adana
without trans-shipment via Istanbul; in any case, the total
inland freight differential in favor of imported steel
would average at the most TL 15 or $1.00 per ton.
c. Landing charges on iMorted steel. The major comparison is
for purchases by large consumers who would take delivery
in railroad car or truck at the steel mill or on the quay
at the port of importation. In the former case, there are
no charges above the mill price. In the latter case (apart
from import duties and taxes), there are certain miniimu
charges for handling and other services, such as warehousing
which are passed on to the buyer (even assuming that the
importer, for large "direct deliveries", would serve
essentially as an agent whose commission would be paid by
the seller). It is estimated that landing costs on imported
flat steel would be of the order of 3 per cent of the c.i.f.
price, and letter of credit and other financial charges and
warehousing costs would amount to another 7 per cent of the
c.i.f. price, making the price of imported steel delivered
e-swarehouse Istanbul, equivalent to c.i.f. plus 10 per cent.
Steel users are known to be prepared to pay a premium of over
20 per cent of the c.i.f. price to obtain steel supplies on
call from Erdemir. Because of the impossibility of quanti-
fying landing charges in any precise manner, prices for
imported steel have been shown either on an f.o.b. or c.i.f.
basis, with an approximate allowance for landing charges
made only in the final aggregate comparison between Erdemir
prices and world prices.
d* Base Prices and extras. Regularly quoted export "base
prices" show the price for a base dimension (or range of
dimensions) and quality when delivered in certain minimum
lots.  Over and above the base price, "extras" are charged
for other dimensions or qualities, smaller lots, or addi-
tional service. The extras normally remain unchanged for
a considerable period of time. Erdemir extras differ
significantly from "Continental" ewtras.
Tables Used in the Price Comparisons
6.        A full comparison of Erdemir prices with equivalent import prices
would be a very time-consuming t#sk since it would mean a virtual re-invoicing
of Erdemir's sales according to the Conmon Market export price lists.  For
this reason, shortcuts were evolved taking into account the following elements:

base prices and extras for 18 different categories of
flat steel distinguished in the company's sales statistics
(Table Pl). 1/
b. A cciparison of Erdemir and Comron Market dimensional
export extras based upon a sample drawn from Erdeir 's
first half of 1969 finished product deliveries and
representing about 37 per cent of these deliveries.
This sample included all specifications sold in large
volume plus a representative number of other specifica-
tions (Table P2).
c. As a rough check on method (b), a complete catalogue of
dimensional extras for cold-rolled sheets, hot.frolled
aheets, hot-rolled skelp, and hot-rolled heavy--agd
medium plates, without an attempt, however, to weight
these extras with the respective sales for each dimen-
sion (Table P3).
d. A comparison of quality extras based upon statistics
from the steel shop regarding the nuimber of heats in
each quality (Table P4).
e. A list comparing Erdemir and ECSC "quality and delivery
extras" for cold-rolled sheets (Table P5).

Results of Comparison (Finished Steel)
7.        The final comparison is shown in TABLE 27 and suumiarized below.
Istanbul was chosen as the point of delivery to compare Erdemir's delivered
prices with delivered import prices. $2 per ton was added to Erdemir's
f.o.b. mill prices to cover freight Eregli-Istanbul. Import prices c.i.f.

Istanbul were increased by 10 per cent to cover landing charges, warehousing
and letter of credit and otnier financial charges. The weighted average price
for Erdemir's flat products, delivered Istanbul is 12.7 per cent above importprices
for flat products landed Istanbul. The weighted average price for Erdemir's
total iron and steel products delivered Istanbul is 11.7 per-cent above
irport prices landed Istanbul. These percentage differences are acceptable
for the Turkish econamy.

/ Tinplate and blackplate prices are traditionally quoted per "base box",
a unit of area equivalent to 112 sheets of 14" x 20", or altogether
31,630 in2 = 20.232 m2. More recently, the European Coal and Steel Com-
munity has started quoting tinplate per 100 m2. The British steel industry
quotes per "standard area of tinning" (S.A.T.), equal to 64,516 m2.
Assuming a specific weight of 7.87 for the steel used in tinplate, a
base box would weigh about 105 lbs for 0.3 mm uncoated sheets. Hence,
the following conversion factors were used:
Weight for
Equivalent      0.5 mm sheets
base boxes           kg
Base Box        1.0              47.63

100 m2          4.943           235.44
The tin coating is applied either by "hot dipping" or electrolytically.
The thickness of the coating is measured either in lbs per base box
(Anglo-Saxon countries) or grams per m2. Common electrolytic coatings
are 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 lbs while the ECSC standard hot-dip coating is
1.25 lbs, respectively 5, 10, 15 and 25 grams per m2.
Recent ECSC base prices are as follows ($ per 100 m2):

Quantity rebates and extras for small lots
1.        Prices quoted differ according to (a) the quantities of each
order and (b) the total annual tonnages taken by each buyer.   As shown
below, substantial extras are charged for items ordered in small quant-
ities; these small lot extras are clearly the main basis for the
existence of wholesalers.

given based upon annual tonnages (for wholesaler-importers or, under "direct
delivery" to large customers).

3.        No similar rebates and extras are practiced by Erdemir, the com-
pany following a one price policy.   It is of interest, however, to ex-
plore what rebates the company would have given if they had followed the
ECSC practice with respect to large annual tonnages.   This may be seen
from the following summary:

Total     489.5        100.0         1238
4.        According to the above tabulation, perhaps ten customers are of
a size where they would qualify for an annual rebate, by ECSC standards.
It is not known how many customers order more than 20,000 tons per year and
how many, if any, order more than 50,000 tons.   Purely as an illustration,
one might assume the following distribution:
Annual      Rebate
Customer Class     Nr.      Tonnage        %
10    20,000        6        82.5        2.5
20 C 50,000        4        120          5.0
On this basis, quantity rebates would reduce the average equivalent import
price by about 1.65 per cent, or not quite $2.50 per ton finished steel.

b)   World Market Prices
There is a surplus of pig iron on the world market, and
prices in recent years have been very low.   Major exporters include
USSR, East Germany, and South Africa.   Other exporters are (a)
smaller specialized blast furnaces generally combined with foundries
and (b) foundries producing pig iron as a co-product with the treat-
ment of non-ferrous ore - i.e. Lilbeck and Duisburger Kupferhutte in
Germany, iron-titanium dioxide combination in Canada.
Present c.i.f. import prices in Western Europe of $70-
72 per ton said to be high in relation to estimated production costs,
including depreciation,of only $38-h3 per ton which is also said to have
been import range a few years ago.
c)   Turkish import prices
Recent Turkish import prices (March 1971) are given by
the company as $72.25 per ton c.i.f. (including ocean freight and
insurance at $11.25).
Major customers are located at Istanbul.   The equiv-
alent world price f.o.b. Eregli would therefore be $72.25-4.33
(coastal freight to Istanbul) = $67.88.
d)   Assumed export prices
The UBC Study assumes export sales of pig iron totalling
250,000 tons per year out of assumed total sales of 150,000 tons.
Consistent with point (c) above, one would assume an export price of
$61 - per ton. Nevertheless, this is subject to two reservationss
- as pointed out under (b), until the recent
upturn in steel prices, pig iron was available
on the world market at prices well below $61
per ton
- on the other hand, Erdemir would benefit from an
export subsidy on the order of E25] per cent of
its f.o.b. price which, with a conservatively
estimated world price for pig iron of, say, $51
per ton, would yield a net sales realization to
the company of $ (51 + 12.75 =) $63.75 per ton.

Ingots
The UEC study gives a price for "special quality" ingots; ex-
cluding production tax of TL 1,700/t. The study indicates that there is
a growing market in Turkey for special grade ingots but has not ind-
icated what grades would be produced by Erdemir except for a sugges-
tion that the company might sell ingots for spring steel and welding
rods to Karabik.   These grades are not presently produced at Erdemir
(see Table P 4).
Applying the ECSC quality extras to Erdemir's 1970 output
one derives an average quality extra of $25.50.   This reflects the
high grade of steel used for flat products and it is doubtful whether
a much higher quality extra could be charged for ingots.   In any
case, no allowance was made in the UEC study for the cost of prod-
ucing ingots of qualities higher than those presently produced by
Erdemir.
According to the UEC estimates, the average cost of pro-
ducing ingots excluding depreciation and excluding selling, general,
and administrative expense would be about 95.5% of the corresponding
cost for continuouseycast billets.   Applying the same "mark-up"
on Erdemir's ingots as on billets (in the absense of world market
quotations for an unknown specification of ingots), one would arrive
at a competitive ingot price, f.o.b. Erdemir of $91 per ton for
special grade ingots.   In this case, no allowance was made for
freight absorption by Erdemir since the main markets were assumed to
be in Central Anatolia (Karabik, Kirikkale).
Billets
The UEC study shows a price oI TL 1573 /t., excluding prod-
uction tax.
The CECA (March-April 1971) export-prices for billets was
$85 per ton with a similar price for Dec. 1970.   The following
domestic prices for CECA countries were quoted in January 1971:
Orig.     U.S. $
Curr.     equiv.
Germany                      395     108.81    Basis Oberhausen
Belgium                    5,000     100.00    Basis Seraing
Luxemburg                  4,300      86.oo    Basis Esch/Belvai
France                       510       92.39    Basis Thionville
526      95.29   Basis  Caen
Italy                      50,000-     80.0o-   Basis Brescia/Lonato
52,000      83.20
58,ooo      92.80    Basis Novi Ligure
In 1970, Karabik imported 25,000 tons of billets at a c.i.f
price of $100.72 ($89 f.o.b.).   This price is unexpectedly high but
is explained by the contract date (Sept. 15, 1970), at which time the
European export price had reached a ten-year high of $90 per ton
f.o.b. On the other hand, it would not seem (at least not at that
date) that Turkey qualified for the same competitive discount of $10
per ton on billets which was granted on rolled products to meet
Eastern Europe competition.
