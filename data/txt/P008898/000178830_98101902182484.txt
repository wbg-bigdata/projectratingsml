INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOtENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR THE ERDEMIR STEEL PLANT EXPANSION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US $76 million to help
finance the expansion of the Erdemir Iron and Steel Company (Erdemir) from
an annual capacity of 0.9 million ingot tons to 1.3 million ingot tons.
The loan would have a term of 15-1/2 years, including 5 years of grace and
would be relent by the Government to Erdemir on substantially the same terms
plus a guarantee fee of 1.5 percent payable to the Government. The loan
would be made jointly with a $40 million loan from the U.S. Agency for Inter-
national Development (USAID) and a $70 million loan from the Export-Import
Bank of the United States (Eximbank), both made also to the Government for
relending to Erdemir.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The level of Bank Group operations in Turkey in past years has been
largely influenced by the almost chronic balance of payments difficulties
and the heavy external debt-service burden, the limited IDA resources which
could be made available to Turkey and to some extent difficulties in project
preparation. Since 1968 the Bank and the Turkish authorities have discusaed
the basis for a major increase in the level of lending. This was regarded
as mainly dependent on improvements in Turkey's capacity to borrow a sub-
stantial part of its needs on Bank terms which could primarily be achieved
by an intensification of measures to improve foreign exchange earnings and
particularly encourage exports by giving high priority to the allocation pf
resources and incentives for export-oriented projects and introducing a num-
ber of reforms in the system of trade and payments. Another important factor
was a significant expansion in Turkey's capacity to select and prepare pro-
jects in priority areas. By the end of 1970, marked progress was made in
these fields culminating in the devaluation of the Turkish lira in August
1970 and the introduction of a stabilization program. The Government recog-
nized the need for Turkey to reach external viability, within a reasonable
time period, and gave high priority to the expansion of exports as the prin-
cipal means to achieve this. Parallel with these developments, the Bank
Group stepped up its level of assistance in project preparation with special
attention being given to selection criteria, institution building and pro-
vision for management and technical assistance. As a result, the volume of
Bank/IDA lending reached $114 million in FY 1971, thus exceeding the level
achieved in the five preceding years.



3.       Bank Group lending to Turkey aims at assisting three major objec-
tives: (a) improving the foreign exchange position particularly through ex-
port promotion; (b) institution building in key sectors including improved
financial viability of the major State Economic Enterprises; and (c) a simul-
taneous effort to check rural migration through agricultural development and
the decentralization of industry and to rationalize urban development. Several
projects financed by the Bank Group in recent years or presently under dis-
cussion focus on the first objective. For instance, emphasis was placed on
export-oriented projects in the last loan (713-TU) made to the Industrial
Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and in the Loan/Credit (762/257-TU) for the
Fruit and Vegetable Export Project.  Other projects for which lending is con-
templated in coming years, especially for livestock, forestry and irrigation,
are expected to enhance Turkey's ability to export but attempts to assist
the expansion of tourism have not borne fruit so far for lack of a firm
Government policy and of suitable projects. The second objective of insti-
tution building has been pursued chiefly in the agriculture (including agri-
cultural credit), power and transportation sectors. The Ba8lk has been in-
strumental in bringing about a comprehensive reorganization of the power
sector culminating in the establishment of the Turlcish power authority (TEK)
to which a loan (763-TU) was made in 1971. It has also acted as executing
agency for UNDP technical assistance studies on transport coordination and a
program for railway rehabilitation, and a first railway project will be appraisec
in 1972. Fina;.ly, the t-o-proinged approach to agricultural and industrial
development of the poorest parts of Central and Eastern Turkey and to urban
development has been started with the second livestock project recently nego-
tiated and with an urban develcpment and water supply project for the Greater
Istanbul area, which is the most rapidly growing urban center.
4.       The industrial development that the Bank is seeking to encourage
in Turkey aims primarily at improving the competitiveness of both the private
and state enterprises which had for a long time been accustomed to a rapid
but inward-oriented growth behind a barrier of high tariffs and quantitative
restrictions. Given Turkey's natural resources and the emergence during the
1960's of a new class of industrial entrepreneurs, increasingly capable and
outward looking, there appears now to be considerable scope for further growth
both in export-oriented industries using domestic raw materials (mining, food
processing, forest products, textiles and boron products) and in import re-
placement (particularly fertilizers and heavy engineering).  Past Bank in-
dustrial lending has been channeled through TSKB whlich has received since
1950 eight loans totaling $126 million to assist private enterprises, cover-
ing the whole spectrum of industrial activities, but mostly for relatively small
projects. The private sector has so far been unable to mobilize capital re-
sources on the scale required for large scale industrial operations which,
as a result, have been left mostly to the Government. The establishment of
Erdemir as a company which,despite a majority Government ownership,is operated
as a private enterprise and eventually to be transferred to private ownership,
represents an effort to resolve this problem,although a long-run solution has
to be sought mainly through the development of the capital market. The pro-
posed loan would finance steel production, and be the first direct lending
operation to industry. Two other loans are currently contemplated for a



-3-
fertilizer plant and a combined forestry and paper mill project respectively.
The Bank is also encouraging the Government to spur industrial development,
which has so far been largely concentrated in Istanbul and the coastal areas,
in the much less developed Eastern part of Turkey on the basis of the exist-
ing natural resources and labor, and to foster labor intensive projects
which would take advantage of Turkey's competitive wage structure.
5.          The execution of most projects has been satisfactory, although
lately a number of projects have experienced prolonged delays before becoming
effective (for details see my Report on the Irrigation Rehabilitation and
Completion Project No. P-1011, dated January 6, 1972).
6.          Five Bank and IDA operations are planned for FY 1972.  A $18 mil-
lion credit for an Irrigation Rehabilitation and Completion project was
approved by the Executive Directors on January 18, 1972. Negotiations for
a second livestock development project and for the IGSAS urea and ammonia
plant project have been substantially completed, and the proposed credit and
loan will be presented to the Executive Directors in late March and April,
respectively. A further loan or credit is contemplated for the Istanbul
urban development and water supply project which has been appraised and is
expected to be negotiated in the first half of 1972.
7.          IFC has been active in Turkey in the past, having participated in
industrial investments for nylon yarn, pulp and paper, glass and aluminum.
Total commitments so far amount to $23.9 million. IFC is currently investi-
gating a number of new investment opportunities in various sectors including
mining, special steel, and cement.
8.          The project was appraised by Bank missions in April and September
1971. The conclusions contained in the appraisal report have also served
as a basis for USAID and Eximbank lending. During negotiations in Washington
in November and December 1971 the Borrower wJas represented by Wr. Ahmet Tufan
Gull, Chief Commercial and Economic Counselor and Mr. Teoman Koprululer,
Counselor, both at the Turkish Embassy, Washington, D.C., and Erdemir by
1Mr. Orhan Goncuoglu, Vice Chairman of the Board, Mr. I4etin Iplikci, President,
and Mr. Kenan Okan, Senior Vice President.



PART II - THE ECONOMY
9.            A report "The Development Prospects of Turkey" (EMA-30a) was dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors on February 4, 1971. This was updated by
a memorandum entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Turkey" (EMA-
40a) dated July 19, 1971, which was distributed on July 26, 1971. The next
economic mission is scheduled for spring 1972. A country data sheet is attached
as Annex II.
10.           Following the 1969 elections, which confirmed the Justice Party in
power, the Government under Prime Minister Demirel faced a constant erosion of
its majority in the National Assembly. At the same time, there was growing
violence by extremist groups of students and unrest among workers, which con-
tinued through 1970 to the early months of 1971. In March 1971, a new "above-
party and reformist" government iwas formed under Prime linister Erim following
the intervention of the Armed Forces and the resignation of the former govern-
ment. The new government's program called for the restoration of law and in-
ternal security, the reorganization of the state administration, more rational
management of the economy and long overdue structural reforms. Growing opposi-
tion from Parliament and the private sector to the reform proposals brought
about the resignation of a large group of technocratic iinisters in December
1971. A new coalition Government headed again by Prime Iiinister Erim, comprises
a large number of representatives of the political parties and fewer technocrats.
Its new program contains substantial parts of the Prime Minister's first policy
declaration in April 1971. It reiterates the national urgency of executing major
structwurl reforms, emphasizes the importance of the survival of democratic pro-
cedures in Turkey and appears to be conciliatory both in tone and in the choice
of key Ministers towards Parliament and the private sector.
11.           The report "The Development Prospects of Turkey" identified the
principal obstacles to development and noted that devaluation and the stabili-
zation program introduced in August 1970 reflected the Government's aim to in-
troduce a new external orientation of the economy and an effort to develop ex-
ports and accelerate progress towards external viability. The report pointed
to the need to improve the situation of public finance and to make more effective
use of the budget as a fiscal instrument in controlling the level of aggregate
demand; to slow down the planned rate of growth of public investment and improve
its composition; to liberalize the external trade regime and promote inter-
national competitiveness; and to embark on an urgent program of rehabilitation
of the principal deficitary State Economic Enterprises (SEEs). These issues
are not new; they have been the central issues in Turkey's economic development
for many years but are of special importance at a time when Turkey aims at
further rapid growth and progress towards external viability.



-5-
J2.      The memorandum on "the Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Turkey" reviewed economic developments since devaluation and described the
M4arch 1971 Government program. The main thrust of the program was towards
long-term structural reforms which were unlikely to bear fruit in less than
2-3 years. The wide-ranging reforms were to include: land and educational
reforms; far-reaching reorganization of the Government administration, in-
cluding SEEs and control of external trade; reform of tax administration
and extension of tax coverage to agricultural incomes; nationalization of
private enterprise in mining, petroleum and forestry industries; and stricter
enforcement of the conditions for foreign capital investment, including in-
sistence on Turkish majority participation.
13.      While law and order were restored rapidly, the first Erim Government
was able, in its eight months of office, to translate few of its long-range
policies into detailed measures and decrees, although it was possible to in-
crease substantially the prices of various SEEs to make them financially
viable. The Government was unable to bring under control a number of criti-
cal short-term difficulties, such as a serious fiscal imbalance and a rapid
price increase, both of which were adversely affected by the financiai im-
plications of the ambitious Personnel Reform introduced by its predecessor.
The private sector's attitude was affected by what were believed to be anti-
business trends in the Government's policies and, consequently, economic
activity did not pick up as rapidly as expected. In the Prime Minister's
December 1971 statement more emphasis is placed on the role of the private
sector which is to enjoy the same importance as the State sector.  Many of
the features of the original program of April 1971 affecting the private
sector have been modified and should help allay the fears of both domestic
and foreign private investors.
14.      Economic growth in 1970 was influenced by factors associated with
civil unrest, growing balance of payments difficulty and devaluation as well
as by unfavorable weather for agriculture. GNP grew by 5.6 percent at con-
stant prices, compared with an average of 6.6 percent in earlier years. In-
dustrial growth slowed down to 3 percent, compared to 10 percent in 1969, and
agricultural output rose by only 1 percent. However, other sectors grew in
the aggregate at 7 percent. In 1971 the economic situation has been favored
by a remarkable improvement in the overall balance of payments position
following the devaluation and by the record agricultural output for the
1970/71 crop year. Despite these favorable factors, which will probably re-
sult in a record growth rate of about 8 percent for the year as a whole, in-
vestment and industrial growrth have only grown slowly from the lowr point
reached at the time of devaluation.
15.      The trade deficit for 1971 has increased but this has been partly
offset, following devaluation, by the increase in workers' remittances to a
record level of $273 million in 1970 and $485 million for 1971. The current
account deficit was also Linanced by increased public capital inflow and some
private foreign investment. As a result, net foreign assets rose to about
$411 million at the end of 1971 compared with about $10 million at the end
of 1970 and a net liability at the end of 1968. Following the changes intro-



-    6    -
dnced in tha relationship between the major world currencies in December 1971,
Turkey established a central rate of 14 Turkish lira to the US dollar
(instead of the previous parity of TL 15 to the dollar).
16.     The growth in domAstic savings, which had been improving during
earlier years, slowed down in 1969 and more noticeably in 1970, the rate of
increase dropping to 2.5 percent in 1970 compared to 14 percent in 1968.
Budgetary resources in particular have been severely strained, mainly because
of the rise in civil servants' salaries under the 1970 Personnel Reform Law.
The public investment target for 1971 (10 percent above 1970) has probably not
been achieved. In the private sector investment has also continued to lag. and
deposits in the banking sector have grown faster than credits. Finally, there have
been substantial price increases in Turkey during the last eighteen months.
A 66 percent devaluation in 1970 increased import prices substantially.    The
change in govermnent salaries and a pattern of high wage settlements have
contributed to inflation.   In addition, the State Economic Enterprises have
implemented long overdue price increases in their products.   As a result,
the wholesale price index increased by 21 percent between August 1970 and
August 1971.
17.     T'hie economic situation in 1971 can be regarded as a transitional one,
reflecting the first effects of major adjustments in exchange rate, domestic
prices and salaries.   Other major factors not likely to be repeated are
probably once-for-all changes, such as clearing of the backlog of imports and
changes in the Personnel Reform Law, which have led to a jump to a new
plateau.   However, the basic economic problems restricting growth remain
unchanged and the need for structural reform is as strong as ever.    Moreover,
the immediate economic situation is severely strained by the heavy budgetary
cost of the Personnel Reform Law, by a possible continued drain on resources
arising from the financial situation of some of the SEEs and by the need to
step up investment expenditures.   At the same time, substantial inflationary
pressures exist from the side of wages and output prices.    In view of these
inflationary pressures and budgetary difficulties, the Government will need
to take energetic but delicately balanced measures to contain aggregate
demand whilst at the same time mobilizing and injecting additional resources
into the economy through efforts to step up investment activity in both the
public and private sectors.   The Government program attaches special
importance to the allocation of resources required for efficient utilization
of existing capacities, investment in quick yielding projects and
concentration on completing on-going ones.   It reiterates the necessity for
renewed efforts to promote exports and calls for a major increase in taxation
to balance the 1972 budget and finance an increase of 30 percent in the level
of public investment expenditures in 1972.   These measures, which will put
the strength of the new Government to a major test, should be supplemented by
an overall income policy and effective machinery for consultation between
the Government, employers and labor to exercise some control over wage and
price increases.
18.     Following successive debt rescheduling and arrangements for debt re-
lief, and the record level of workers' remittances in 1970, the debt service
ratio was lower than expected, amounting to 16 percent of total foreign ex-



-7-
change earnings. In the longer term, if the country enjoys political stabil-
ity and if the Government intensifies its efforts to promote exports and can
push through at least a modified reform program, the economic prospects remain
promising. Turkey, however, will continue to need substantial external assis-
tance. But even with a projected gross inflow of external assistance in ex-
cess of $400 million per year and gradually hardening terms, the debt service
burden is unlikely to be much above 15 percent of exports of goods and ser-
vices, including workers' remittances, provided exports and workers' remit-
tances continue to grow as projected.
PART II; - TIE STEEL SECTOR
19.         Detailed reports on the Turkish industrial sector were distributed
to the Executive Directors as Annexes of the main economic report on Turkey
entitled "The Development Prospects of Turkey" (ENk-30a) dated February 1,
1971. They are respectively "The Mining Sector" (Volume IV, Annex II, dated
September 20, 1971), "The Manufacturing Industries" (Volume V, Annex III,
dated December 10 1971), "The Forest Industries" (Volume VI, Annex IV, dated
December 10, 19715, and "The Engineering Industries" (Volume VII, Annex V,
dated December 10, 1971).
20.         The rate of industrial growth in recent years has averaged about
10 percent and has permitted the broadening of the industrial structure, which
now covers a wide variety of heavy engineering goods including metal process-
ing, as well as durable consumer goods, phosphate and nitrogen fertilizer,
synthetic fibers, newsprint, kraft paper, etc. Plants presently under con-
struction will make aluminum, motor vehicles, and major chemical intermediates.
Although the emphasis given to industrialization has permitted the Turkish in-
dustrial sector to reach 20 percent of GNP in 1969, growth has been largely
based on import substitution with too often little regard for cost competitive-
ness.
21.         The growfth in Turkish manufacturing output during the 1960's was
spurred by the industrial materials and equipment industries among wrhich steel,
next to machinery, showed the highest increase. Steel consumption in Turkey
grew 12.3 percent per year during the 1960's reaching a level of 1.4 million
tons of finished steel in 1970. Flat steel constitutes slightly less than
one third of the entire steel market, and is expected to continue its growth
at rates exceeding 10 percent per year. On this basis demand for Erdemir's
output of flat steel is expected to be about 800,000 tons per year in 1975 and
about 1,300,000 tons per year in 1930.
22.         Erdemir is the only significant flat steel producer in Turkey,
manufacturing 486,000 of the 525,000 tons of finished steel consumed in 1970.
The remainder was provided by imports and some minor production of sheet at
Karabiik, a state-owned enterprise, which hold' 29 percent of Erdemir's shares
and is the major producer of shapes, rounds, and construction steel. Total
consumption in 1971 was 551,000 tons but supply was restrained in that year
by a blast furnace breakdown at Erdemir. The Erdemir expansion is scheduled
in two stages (the first of which constitutes the present project) and will
increase Erdemir's flat steel capacity to 1.2 million tons with a view to
meetting domestic flat steel demand through 1980 for all except a small volume



-8 -
of specialty flat steel products which will be imported. If Stage II is not
implemented in the middle to late 1970's, the expected shortfall by 1980 in
domestic flat steel production would be about 355,000 tons.
23.         KarabEfi has a capacity of 600,000 tons of ingot steel which are
processed mainly into non-flat products (billets, bars, rods). Total 1971
production in the non-flat sector was about 830,000 tons with a number of
small firms responsible for over 200,000 tons. The increase in demand for
these products is expected to be met by a new 900,000 ton USSR-financed plant
now under construction at Iskenderun which is scheduled to begin production
around 1976. Karabik is a major shareholder of this state-owned company and
will be responsible for its management. Immediately before the completion of
the Iskenderun Plant and the Erdemir Stage I expansion, flat, non-flat and
scrap steel imports may reach about 1 million tons by 1974-75. If steel de-
mand continues to grow at the projected rate of 10 percent throughout the
seventies, construction of further capacity in the steel sector will have to be
initiated before 1980.
24.         Turkey's present steel import policy relies chiefly on quantita-
tive restrictions rather than on duties which average only about 15 percent
for steel products. Wqhen domestic production is available, import licenses
are normally not granted. Future policy will be guided by agreements with the
European Iron and Steel Community (EISC), after Turkey's transitional affili-
ation with the European Economic Community (EEC) is ratified by Turkey and
the EEC member countries. No specific commitments have so far been made to
reduce tariff or quantitative restrictions for items included in the EISC
product lists, but it has been agreed that negotiations on a program of grad-
ual reduction will start after 1975. A few steel products, such as billets,
are treated separately from those in the EISC lists, and it has already been
agreed that these products will be freed gradually from import restrictions
over a 22-year period. Turkey's affiliation with the EEC will also relax re-
strictions on products which use steel as a raw material and, thereby, will
also provide competition indirectly for Erdemir.
25.         The justification for an expanded Turkish steel industry is based
primarily on its ability to operate on an economic scale at competitive prices
and on Turkey's virtual self-sufficiency in coal and iron ore. The relatively
sophisticated industrial sector includes major steel consumers for whom a com-
petitive steel price is essential, such as machinery and metal fabrication,
appliances, automotive and tractor manufacture, and all types of pipe for
water, gas and electricity. Much of the production is for domestic consump-
tion but Turkey's increasing links with the Common M4arket may provide export
potential, and the favorable wage rates of Turkish labor offer sub-contract-
ing opportunities to Common Market firms in the metals fabrication sector.
Competitive prices for steel supplies may also enable Turkish tractor and
appliance manufacturers to compete in regional export markets. It is in this
context of achieving an input at reasonable prices for the Turkish steel con-
suming industry, that the Erdemir expansion project has its main significance.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
26.     A report entitled "Appraisal of the Erdemir Steel Plant Expansion
Project" (PI-13a, dated February 4, 1972) is attached.    A Loan and Project
Summary is attached as Annex III.
The Company
27.     The Erdemir Iron and Steel Company is operated as a private enterprise
as provided for in its Articles of Association although the Government owns
the majority of the shares.   The Company was formed in May 1960 with loans
from USAID and the Turkish Government, and equity from the Turkish Government
(represented by Karabuk and Sumerbank), Koppers Associates (USA), and the
Turkish private sector.   It had an initial capacity of 470,000 ingot tons
per year.   Equipment for the mill was provided by Koppers Associates and a
consortium of US suppliers, and operations started in late 1965.   Present
capacity in place or under construction is 900,000 ingot tons per year. Over
the past few years Erdemir has been able to produce close to capacity.
Erdemir's management is efficient and results oriented, and the plant has
excellent operational and budgetary control systems.   Its workforce of
Turkish nationals has quickly learned the required skills and the plant has
shown a steady improvement in manhours spent per ton of steel produced.
28.     Despite efficient management, the inadequate scale of Erdemir
operations has meant high cost steel.   The larger European flat steel mills
have a capacity in excess of two million tons and operate at investments per
ton considerably below Erdemir's present investment level of $415/ton.   This
difference is significant since capital costs comprise about one-fourth of
total production cost.   The project now proposed will reduce investment per
ton on the entire plant from $415 to $340.   Labor costs are also affected by
economies of scale and will be reduced from 194 TL/ton to 115 TL/ton by the
project as the labor force will increase by only one-third while saleable
output increases 2.5 times.   Turkey's lower wage rates will substantially
counter-balance an investment cost disadvantage which will still remain even
after the completion of the project.   In addition, the Company which was
heavily geared towards debt since its inception will, as a result of the
financial reconstruction agreed upon during negotiations and despite the
new debt contracted for the project, see the interest payments reduced from
20 percent of cost of goods sold in 1970 to 15 percent in 1977.
The Project
29.     The project, known as the Stage I expansion, is designed to double
Erdemir's major facilities, and includes a second blast furnace, a third
oxygen vessel, a billet caster, a semi-continuous hot strip mill, an expanded
cold reduction mill, and additional auxiliary equipment.   At the end of the
project in 1976, Erdemir's manufacturing facilities will produce over
900,000 tons of flat products, 300,000 tons of billets, 60,000 tons of ingot
and 180,000 tons of pig iron.   The Stage II expansion of rolling facilities,



- 10 -
not financed by this project, is expected to begin in 1976-77 to utilize the
spare capacity of the second blast furnace and increase flat steel output to
meet the expected demand of 1980.  Ultimately, Erdemir could be expanded to
a capacity of 4-5 million tons.
30.     United States Steel Engineers and Consultants, Inc.(UEC) prepared
the feasibility report on the project which was completed in September 1970.
Turkey's demand for steel produacts through 1980 is projected by the Bank-at
somewhat higher than that forecast by UEO, implying a margin of safety for
the project.   Should a higher demand in fact materialize, the Company could
advance the additional rolling capacity planned for Stage II and also the
installation of continuous slab casting.
Cost and Financing
31.     The cost of the project, including incremental working capital and
$35 million of physical and escalation contingencies, is estimated at $290
million equivalent, of which the foreign exchange component is $181 million.
After the negotiations for the Bank loan were completed, these estimates were
increased by $5 million to allow for possible additional foreign exchange
costs and the amount of the proposed Eximbank loan increased correspondingly.
Financing for the project is thus now provided for a total of $295 million
and will come from the following sources:
Foreign Exchange Financing         (in $ million)
IBRD                                   76
USAID                                  4
Eximbank                               70
Sub-total          186
Local Currency Financing

The AID loan will bear a 3 percent interest rate to the Government and will
be relent to the Company at 7 percent. Repayment is scheduled over a period
of 15-1/2 years including a grace period of five years. The Eximbank loan
will have an average interest rate of 6.5 percent to the Company and will be
repaid in 16 years with 4-1/2 years of grace
32.     Contingency and escalation allowances in the project cost estimates
and a capital cost overrun guarantee by the Government provide the safeguards
needed to protect a project of this magnitude.  However, in view of the
possibility that contingencies may not be used in their entirety, the Bank has
provided for additional flexibility in the financing plan by agreeing to
finance interest and other charges on its loan during construction to a
maximum of $7 million.   Interest payments will be charged to the Bank loan

from the beginning but this arrangement will be suspended if it becomes
apparent that the remaining balance is required for equipment.
33.     In view of the Company's high existing debt equity ratio, equity
for the expansion would have been particularly desirable but private equity
capital in Turkey is not presently available on the scale needed for this
project and an increase in the Government's share in the equity could
probably not have been made without altering the private character of Erdemir.
Instead, a reorganization of existing loans from the Government and AID has
been negotiated to assure adequate debt service for the new loans and a sound
financial basis for the Company. The Turkish Government has agreed to
defer repayments and servicing of its original Main Construction Loan of
TL 469 million, made in 1960, until all new foreign exchange loans have been
repaid.   Also, payments on Turkey's other loans to the Company have been
deferred until 1976 i.e. after the Stage I construction period.  USAID has
deferred some of the repayments due during the construction period on its
three earlier loans of 1960, 1961 and 1964. Subject to a current ratio test
agreed upon during negotiations, the servicing of certain of these loans
could be further deferred, thus providing an additional safeguard for the
new foreign exchange debts.
34.     Erdemir has been profitable in every year of its operation except
the first, reaching a profit before tax of over TL 130 million in 1969 and
1970. This performance was not matched in 1971 because of a blast furnace
breakdown but, with normal operations and the recent increase in selling
prices which primarily compensate for cost increases in inputs, profits in excess
of the 1970 levels are expected during the construction period.  The
reorganization of past debts and improved operating results assure adequate
debt service coverage which reaches its lowest level of 1.5 in 1977 and
improves rapidly thereafter.  Payment of dividends, cash distributions, and
other borrowings by the Company will also be restricted. Nevertheless,
Erdemir should be able, in the long run, to distribute dividends at a
sufficiently high level to attract private Turkish investors and thus to
enable the Company to widen its equity base and the Government to divest
itself of its shares as provided for in the Company's Articles of Association.
Procurement
35.     Procurement for the project under the Eximbank, USAID and Bank loans
has been designed, after assessment of the relative competitiveness of the
various sources of supply, so as to impose the least cost penalty to the
Company from tied procurement. Erdemir has pre-allocated to
Eximbank the financing of consulting services by US firms as well as that
part of the equipment which could be competitively procured from US sources.
Procurement under the Eximbank loan will be carried out under their usual
procedures limiting bidding to US suppliers only.  The rest of the equip-
ment to be financed under the USAID and Bank loans will be procured against
the lowest evaluated bids emerging from international competitive bidding.
All awards to US suppliers meeting USAID criteria will be first set off
against the USAID loan but should this loan be exhausted before the Bank loan,
further lowest US awards will be paid out of the Bank loan. Should the
Bank loan be exhausted first, the remaining equipment will be procured
under USAID procedures limiting the bidding to US suppliers.



- 12 -
36.      The Bank loan would be disbursed against the delivered cost of
equipment purchased under international competitive bidding.  All equipment
for the project will continue to be exempted from import duties as was the
case for the original plant. Because of the joint procurement arrangements
with USAID, the specific items to be financed by the Bank will depend on the
outcome of the bidding.
37.      Contracts for civil works which will be financed by Erdemir will be
submitted to competitive bidding in Turkey. Should it appear that domestic
construction industry constraints would result in delays and undue cost in-
creases, the Bank and Erdemir have agreed that international competitive
bidding would be used for part of the civil works.
38.      The Koppers Company which headed the consortium of U.S. suppliers
which designed and built the original Erdemir facility and is a shareholder
in Erdemir, has been the successful bidder for the general engineering con-
tract for the project for which Erdemir obtained bids from several qualified
firms; this contract will be financed by Eximbank. While Koppers will have
responsibility for the design and supervision of the expansion project,
Erdemir will, in addition, enter into a long term technical assistance con-
tract with an international steel producer in order to have access to new
technical developments and operating techniques in the steel industry. The
Bank would finance up to $1.0 million of the cost of the technical assistance
contract.
39.      TWo ecologists engaged by the Bank have studied in detail the present
and future situation of the Company's plant at Eregli, on the Black Sea Coast
with regard to air and water pollution. Their preliminary findings confirm
that environmental damage due to present plant operations are minor, although
as the plant expands attention must be given to disposal and treatment of
liquid and gaseous wastes. Erdemir has agreed to undertake ecological im-
provements and a provision of $5.0 million has been included in the project
cost estimate for this purpose.
Benefits
4o.      The economic benefits of the project derive from savings of foreign
exchange by manufacturing rather than importing finished flat steel. The
project will operate largely on domestic iron ore and coal, and will save
Turkey about $60 million in foreign exchange per year. At the completion of
the project Erdemir's production costs will become reasonably competitive
with those of its European competitors. For the moment, Turkey will have to
continue to use quantitative restrictions for steel and steel-using imports
but over the longer term the project will enable Turkey to meet the obliga-
tions which will arise in this respect from its Association Agreement with
the EEC.

41.       Before the currency revaluations of December 1971, Erdemir's domes-
tic selling prices based on the 1976 product mix were calculated to be 11.7
percent higher in the average than import prices net of duties as shown in
the following table:

Weighted Average                      161.16             144.25         11.7
The currencies of the major European steel producing countries and Japan have
risen between 2 and 10 percent against the Turkish lira. The most recent
(January 1972) export prices in US $ terms of European Common Market countries
have been increased by between US $5 and US $10/ton, equivalent to 2 to 8 per-
cent of the FOB Europe prices and this will have the effect of reducing the
margin between prices of domestic and imported steel. With regard to future
prices, the Company has agreed to consult the Bank before implementing changes
from present prices.
42.       Periodically a wJorld wide surplus of steel products has depressed
prices a-d motivated "dumping" of steel exports.   Erdemir, as most steel pro-
ducers, would not be able to withstand such competition without protection.
But Erdemir's prices are more competitive when buyers take into account the
advantages of a secure domestic steel supply during periods of worldwide steel
shortages. For example inflated prices and long delivery times in 1969 in-
curred cost penalties to steel importing countries. Over the long term world
steel prices are expected to drop in real terms as a result of new technology
and the construction of even larger plants. But future expansion of Erdemir
as Turkey develops should permit the Company to operate with acceptable levels
of protection.
43.       To ensure Erdemir's, and Turkey's, continuing ability to improve its
international cost competitiveness, the Government has agreed to give priority
to the Stage II Erdemir expansion before considering the construction of any new
flat steel mills. In addition, a study will be undertaken to determine means
for improving the production and transport of domestic iron ore. The iron con-
tent of domestic ore is presently 10 percent more expensive than top grade
foreign ore. Its use also reduces blast furnace capacity by 15 percent which,
during periods of capacity constraints, leads to large losses in potential pro-
fits and foreign exchange savings. The study should lead to steps to correct
these problems and, until the recommendations of the study are implemented,
the Company will be allowed to obtain at least 20 percent of its ore re-
quirements from abroad. This level of imports represents an attempt at a
balance between the long term need to develop domestic ore mines and the short
term benefits of using higher quality imported ore.



- 14 -
44.     The internal economic and financial rates of return of the project
are estimated at 18 and 21.2 percent, respectively.
Employment
45.     While the project aims primarily at making more competitive the
largest industrial enterprise in Turkey, it will nevertheless have significant
employment effects.   The Company's labor force is expected to add
approximately 1,200 men.   The jobs created indirectly in both the supplier
and user industries of Erdemir will be even more numerous.   As regards
Erdemir's supplier industries, Turkey has some possibility of exporting coking
coal not used domestically, but Erdemir's expansion will require the prod-
uction of an additional one million tons of iron ore each year - a 50
percent increase in ore production - which otherwise would not take place
since Turkish iron ore is not of an exportable quality. Erdemir's expansion
should provide the impetus for the necessary additional investment to take
place in the supplier industries employing about 12,000 additional workers.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.     The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the Bank,
the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and Erdemir, the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of the Resolution concerning the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
47.     The Executive Directors' attention is drawn to the covenants in the
draft Loan Agreement related to: changes in the Company's Articles of
Association which require the Bank's consent (Section 4.03);  the study of
domestic iron ore to be carried out by the Government (Section 4.04); the
importation of foreign iron ore by the Company (Section 4.06); the
coordination of expansion of steel producing facilities in Turkey (Section
4.08);  and the fnformation to be provided to the Bank regarding the system
of import quotas and duties for steel products in Turkey (Section 5.0)
The covenant related to steel prices in the draft Project Agreement (Section
3.10) as well as Schedule 1 thereto on procurement procedures are also of
special interest.
48.     I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
49.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
