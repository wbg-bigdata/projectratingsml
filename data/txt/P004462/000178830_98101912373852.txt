APPRAISAL OF THE RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
1. THE POWER SECTOR
General
1.C1      The power sector in the Philippines has historically been poorly
coordinated and uneven in performance and institutional strength.  In 1970,
there were 336 private utilities and 122 public utilities, most of which were
very small and located in urban areas.  Since then a number have been  taken
over by rural cooperatives and some have ceased operating.  As of August 1977,
about 85 utilities and 73 cooperatives were actually supplying consumers.
The Manila Electric Company (MECO), responsible for generation and distribution
in the greater Manila area, dominates the private sector, while the National
Power Corporation (NPC) is the largest public utility. MECO accounted for
about 63%, and NPC 29%, of total electricity generated by utilities in 1976.
Many of the smaller utilities have distributed power purchased from NPC and MECO
but some have also generated their own power, accounting for the remaining 8%.
Only about 26 of the 85 utilities sold more than 5 Gwh in 1976 and only about
19 of the 39 generating plants owned were larger than 1 MW. Service by the
small utilities (and some of the larger) has been substandard, costly, and
confined to the centers of urban areas; no attempt had been made to carry power
to villages. The absence of reliable power supplies has caused many industries
to resort to captive plants to meet their power needs.
1.02      Fragmented ownership of the generation and distribution facilities
became an important obstacle to the coordinated development of the power
sector. The Government, therefore, formed the National Electrification
Administration (NEA) in 1969 under Republic Act 6038 (revoked in 1973 and
replaced by Presidential Decree 269), which declared the national objective
of total electrification on an area coverage I1 basis through electric
cooperatives. Little progress was made until after the declaration of
martial law in late 1972. The Government announced in Presidential Decree
No. 40 that the total electrification of the country was a national policy
objective which should be achieved by establishing island grids, integrating
generating systems and consolidating electric distribution franchise systems.
NPC was made responsible for island grids, the development of all future
generation supplying the grids and ultimately, for owning and operating all
generating facilities. MECO, now the largest generating as well as distribut-
ing company, will eventualLy become only a distributing utility; negotiations
for transferring the bulk of MECO's generating plants and transmission lines
to Government are nearing conclusion.
1.03      The Department of Energy (DOE), created in 1977, is the policymaking
body for the power sector responsible for formulating policies and programs
/1 Area coverage means connecting every house or building provided
that the cost of doing so is reasonable in relation to overall
system costs.

on power development and coordinating the activities of all organizations
connected with electric power, including approval of the power project
pipeline and the ratemaking policy. Responsibility for granting power
franchises is also covered and assurances were obtained during negotiations
and incorporated into the Guarantee Agreement that licenses for power genera-
tion and distribution will continue to be granted by NEA. The DOE coordinates
policy for NEA, NPC, MECO and all other utilities. NPC and NEA both report
to it. The Department Secretary is the Chairman of the boards of directors
of both NEA and NPC to ensure coordination of the two corporations.
1.04      The intrasectoral responsibilities of NEA and NPC are clearly
defined. If properly implemented, the reorganization of the sector will
lead to better coordination in power development. Progress is already
apparent. NEA's eEforts in setting up rural cooperatives have been
welcomed in the provinces, and consumers have shown themselves willing to
pay the cost of power supplies whether at low or high tariff levels. NPC
has committed itself to a massive generation and transmission development
program, not only in Luzon, where its activities were concentrated in the
past, but also in Mindanao and the Visayas. NEA should have no difficulty
in carrying out its share of the program but NPC's responsibilities have
been greatly increased and it is reorganizing to meet these.  Its mana-
gerial, technical and financial ability to carry out its ambitious program
has yet to be proven.
The Bank's Role in the Sector
1.05      To date  :he Bank has made seven loans to NPC, and IDA one credit
to the Government, totaling US$218.3 million, to assist in the development
of the Philippines' power sector. The first loan, for US$14.4 million,
was made in 1957 to provide partial financing for the Binga hydroelectric
project. The most recent, signed in August 1977, made US$58 million available
for expansion of the transmission system in Luzon, the first stage of a
central load dispatching system, and consultants' services. Although some of
the projects financed either exceeded the original execution schedules or
experienced cost overruns, all of them are being operated satisfactorily.
1.06      The proposed loan of US$60.0 million would be the first from the
Bank to NEA for power expansion and would help finance the 1979-1980 portion
of the rural electrification program; it would provide access to electricity
service for more than 5.3 million individuals in the countryside and help to
increase incomes arong the poorest population.
Main Characteristics of the Sector
1.07      Electricity generation in the Philippines grew at an annual rate of
11.0% over the period 1970-1976, while GDP grew at a rate of 6.0% over the
same period. Per capita electricity generation is estimated at 323 kwh.
Installed capacity at the end of 1976 was 3,542 MW including self-production;
oil-fired thermal power plants accounted for 80% of total energy generation.
1.08      There are currently approximately 2.3 million subscribers for an
estimated population of 43 million. The population serviced throughout the
country rose from 27% in 1972 to 32% in 1976 as shown below:

There are marked contrasts in electricity consumption among the different
regiLons. The Luzon market accounts for 73% of all consumption. In its turn,
the central area around Manila accounts for more than 80% of consumption on
Luzon although less than 65% of the Luzon population lives in this region.
1.09      Public utility companies supply 79% of total electric power, the
rest being produced by self-production. Self-suppliers (mainly sugar mills,
cement plants, and mining enterprises) own 20% of the country's installed
capacity. The following tab:Le shows installed capacity and power generated
in the Philippines in 1976.

Information about the generating capacities and energy production of NPC
and MECO is readily available, but a complete analysis of past trends in the
Philippines power sector is hampered by a lack of data about the capacities
and production of the Bnwl utilities and -rivp---   I'ed rlans   r-^-ol_
idated statistics of energy consumption for private utilities by class of
customer are not readily available except for MECO's customers. As the
Government has just set up a Department of Energy on which the electric
utilities will depend (para 1.03), it is expected that this basic information
will be kept up to date in future to assure the best allocation of resources
in the expansion of- the power sector.
Development Program
1.10      NEA aims to establish a cooperative in each province by the end of
1977, complete the backbone or primary distribution system by 1980, provide
electricity to all barrios by 1984, and attain total electrification of
the country by 1990. The following plan has been devised to achieve those
targets:
No. of Barrios         No. of New
Year          to be Energized         Connections
Annually             Annually
1977              2,524                 278,900
1980              4,531                 436,137
1984              2,414                 572,100
1.11      NPC is also embarking on a large program to provide the generating
plant and transmission lines required for the electrification of the country
as a whole, as well as meeting the increase in demand in areas which already
have adequate service, such as the greater Manila area.
1.12      Significant changes are expected to take place in the sources of
electric energy in the coming years. The relative importance of petroleum
for power generation would decline to be replaced by hydro, geothermal and
nuclear as shown below:
INSTALLED CAPACITY

Hydro                  644     18.2      2,677      31.5
Geothermal            -          -         745       8.7
Nuclear               -          -         600       7.0
Total             3,542    100.0       8,516    100.0



1.13      The capital investment required for the proposed development
program from 1977 through 1983 is estimated at US$7.3 billion (P 54.0 bil-
lion) at current prices including finance charges and price escalation, as
shown below:
Investment 1977-1983
IJS$ Million        %
NPC        6,000            82.0
MECO          400             5.5
NEA           500             7.0
Other         400             5.5
Total    7,300           100.0
The Government will have to provide a large part of the investment
required for the power expansion program in the coming years since existing
consumers are only able to contribute about 8% to the construction program
even though the rate of return may reach about 10% on revalued net fixed
assets. This is acceptable due to the fact that the cost of residential
service is at present as high as 5% of the disposable personal income and
current coop tariffs approximate the marginal cost of power.

2.01      The Borrower would be NEA, a stock corporation fully owned by the
Government with an authorized capital of two billion pesos, of which
P 618 million was paid up at end-1976. Corporate powers are vested in a
Board of Administrators of iEive members, including NEA's executive head, who
is an ex-officio member. The Chairman and members are Presidential appointees
and serve for six-year terms. The General Manager of NPC is also a member of
the Board.
2.02      NEA was originally created in 1969; its duties and responsibilities
were redefined in Presidential Decree 269 of August 1973, which is currently
NEA's charter. The main objective of NEA is the total electrification of
the Philippines on an area coverage basis. NEA is empowered to make loans
to public service entities with preference to cooperatives. NEA is also
responsible for licensing electric power franchises and assurances were
obtained and provisions included in the Guarantee Agreement that it will
continue to do so under the new DOE. Since 1972, NEA has mainly granted
franchises to rural electric cooperatives, 91 of which were in existence at
mid-1977 with 73 supplying electricity and 18 with buildings, backbone lines
and distribution systems under construction.
2.03      NEA has its head office in Manila.  The current organization
chart is shown in Annex 1. Three Deputy Administrators are responsible for
administration and cooperative development, engineering and materials, and



finance and franchises. In addition, training, special studies and other
divisions report directly to the Acting Administrator. NEA has met its
responsibilities efficiently as evidenced by the success of the program; it
is generally a well-operated and managed organization but the rapid acceler-
ation of the electrification program has caused certain strains. Emphasis
has been on initial organization of cooperatives and program implementation
with the day to day utility operations taking a secondary role.
2.04      Staff of NEA are closely involved in the formation and operation
of the cooperatives. NEA has developed manuals which lay down standard
operating procedures to be followed by cooperatives. NEA audit, engineering
and other administration staff ensure that these procedures are followed.
Standard operating practices are based on those of the National Rural Electric
Cooperative Association of US, which originally provided consultants to NEA
under USAID auspices.
2.05      Ten year development and financial plans are compiled for coops in
the initial feasibility and architectural and engineering studies. These
have not been updated annually as the coop situation and projected load
growth has changed. Currently, five-year plans are only available for five
coops. It was agreed during negotiations that NEA will form a planning unit
that inter-alia would prepare five year plans for all coops by end-1978 and
10 year plans by end-1979; thereafter all would be updated annually.
Audit and Accounts
2.06      NEA's annual accounts were made up on a Government department basis
until 1974, which precluded the preparation of income statements and
balance sheets. Since 1974, income statements and balance sheets have been
prepared in the conventional commercial form. Accounting is good and the
staff which includes a number of CPA's, are competent.
2.07      The audit of NEA's annual accounts is carried out by the Auditor
of the Administration who is appointed by the Auditor-General, the ex-officio
auditor. The Auditor of the Administration who serves full time in NEA
headquarters approves all checks prior to payment; the procedure used has in
effect, been a pre-audit rather than a post-audit analysis of the balance
sheet. It was agreed during negotiations that the Government, with the
assistance of the Bank, will undertake a review of the auditing procedures
for NEA.
Consolidation and Coordination of Information
2.08      NEA obtains monthly reports on coop operations, construction and
other aspects of coop activities. The available information has not been
consolidated in the past and it was agreed during negotiations that an
information section will be established in the planning unit to gather and
consolidate informal'ion and statistics relating to all coops.



-7-
Cooperatives
2.09      Organization and Management.  Cooperatives are organized with
the help of NEA at the request of district electrification committees which
are formed from local municipal councilors. A feasibility study is carried
out of the proposed cooperative area by NEA staff to ensure that the coop-
erative would be financially viable. The cooperative is then registered
with a board of directors each of whom represents one or more munici-
palities /1 as required to limit the maximum number of board members to
about seven. The coops then conclude a loan agreement with NEA. A
manager, and architectural and engineering consultants are appointed on
terms and conditions and with qualifications and experience satisfactory
to NEA.
2.10      Consultants.  Local consulting firms plan and design the system
and buildings and supervise the construction of both. These firms have
gained considerable experience in the design and construction of distribution
systems during the first five years of program implementation. The local
firms will continue to be supervised by NEA with the assistance of Stanley
Consultants, Inc. of the U.S. (financed by USAID), whose present contract
extends through 1980.
2.11      Reports and Progress Certificates.  Cooperatives send reports to
NEA on all aspects of operations:
(a) monthly operations;
(b) annual budgets - capital and operating; and
(c) construction progress and related certificates.
The construction progress certificates are required by NEA before funds
are released to the cooperative to make payments to the contractor.
Certificates are issued by the A&E consultants and progress is often also
verified by NEA staff.
2.12      Audit and Accounts.  Coop accounting and management audits are
carried out by NEA staff to verify that accounts and books are properly
maintained and up to date. However, a final audit of the annual accounts is
not carried out and currently the annual income statements and balance sheets
of each coop have no audit certificate. Agreement was obtained during
negotiations that the annual accounts of each coop be certified by auditors
acceptable to the Bank for the year ending December 31, 1978 and every year
thereafter.
2.13      Manpower and Training.  NEA trains all the personnel required to
man the coops, including managers, accountants, linemen, electricians, and
plant operators. Courses and training tours have also been sponsored in
the US. By the end of 1976, a total of 516 courses had been held covering
19,400 participants.
2.14      The Philippines is one of the most advanced developing countries
in the field of rural electrification. The RE program is working well and
/1 Approximately equivalent to a US county.



- 8 -
is being pursued vigorously; consequently, other developing countries are
studying the program for possible use in promoting their own RE programs.
During 1976, a conference-study tour on rural electrification was held
with about 40 participants from 13 countries.
2.15      NEA and the cooperatives are well-manned with adequately trained
and qualified staff. The manpower needs of the RE program are met by
recruitment from the educated and skilled manpower available in the
Philippines, who are then given specific training in the standard procedures
and the functions in which they will be employed in NEA or the cooperatives.
2.16      Insurance.  Individual coops have arranged some insurance coverage
but generally coops carry only motor vehicle insurance. NEA is in process of
establishing a mutual insurance fund to provide adequate coverage for coop
facilities. It was agreed during negotiations that all coops would hold
insurance coverage satisfactory to the Bank.
2.17      Tariff Policy.  General NEA policy is that each cooperative is an
individual entity which must be financially self-supporting, although subsidies
are provided in the form of tax exemption and low lending rates that do not
exceed 3% p.a.   Tariffs are fixed by the individual coop boards to meet this
objective. In doing so, the coops endeavor to comply with targets laid down by
NEA that tariffs should be fixed to cover cash operating expenses 1/  in the first
year of operation and cash operating expenses plus 15%, 25%, 35% and 50% of
the sixth year's debt service for the second through fifth years of operation,
respectively, so that an aggregate of 125% of the sixth year's amortization
and interest is available to the coop at the beginning of that year.
2.18      Anomalies currently exist in the tariff levels among the cooperatives.
Although these will be addressed during the tariff study to be carried out
under Loan 1460-PH (made in 1977 to NPC), two aspects were discussed during
appraisal. The first is the large variation in tariff levels among coops.
Tariff levels currently range from P 0.15 (USJ2.0) to g 1.16 (USd15.6),
depending on whether the power comes from cheap hydro sources in northern
Mindanao or from diesel generation for a small coop in South Leyte. Some
cross funding from prosperous to less prosperous coops may be justified and
could be achieved by NEA having different terms of lending for the cooper-
atives.  The second aspect is that there is little or no subsidy for poor
consumers. Generally, coops have a flat rate per kWh whether or not covered
by the minimum charge. Under Loan 1460-PH, it was agreed that the Government
will consult with the Bank on its tariff policies when the ongoing tariff
study is completed, which is expected at end-1978.

Load Promotion Programs
2.19      NEA promotes the use of electric power through the following
programs:
(a)  Illumination for Learning and Work;
(b)  Rural Water Service;
(c)  Fishermen's Assistance;
(d)  Small-Scale Industry; and
(e)  Irrigation.
2.20      The Illumination for Learning and Work project is a program for
making loans of a maximum of 1 50,000 (US$6,700) to RE coops willing to
onlend to school boards for schoolhouse wiring. Close liaison is maintained
with the Department of Education and Culture; evening classes are organized
for adult education, vocational courses, social activities, and other instruc-
tion using educational television. Nine hundred and four public schools with
7,281 classrooms had been electrified by mid-1977. Thousands of adults and
out-of-school youths have enrolled in various evening classes and for the
formal five-year secondary and college courses offered in these schools.
2.21      The Rural Water Service Program began in 1976, the purpose being
the formation of village water supply coops to construct facilities for a
potable water supply comprising an electric pump, a small storage tank and a
communal .standpipe distribution system. Five associations had been formed
by mid-1977 and six feasibility studies were under evaluation.
2.22      The Fishermen's Assistance Program provides loans to associations
for the construction of ice plants, cold storage plants and markets. By mid-
1977, NEA had lent F 4.8 million (US$140,000) to five fishermen's associations.
2.23      The Small-Scale Industry Program aims at fostering employment
in the provincial areas by using electric power. The Bank made a loan
to NEA of US$ 2.3 million in 1975 to assist in financing machinery for these
coops. Total loans of 1 3.35 million (US$447,000) had been committed to ten
coops by NEA at mid-1977.
3. THE POWER MARKET
Historic Background
3.01      Electric power generated in the Philippines totalled 13,896 Gwh in
1976: Luzon producing 73% (10,150 Gwh), the Visayas 13% (1,773 Gwh) and
Mindanao 14% (1,973 Gwh). A considerable amount of the electric power
generated in the Visayas (74%) and Mindanao (27%) was produced by captive
industrial plant.



- 10 -
3.02       The Luzon interconnected system is the main electricity system in
the Philippines and comprises the generating and transmission facilities
of the two largest- public utility companies operating in the region, namely
MECO, serving the Manila metropolitan area and adjacent zones, and NPC, which
supplies the proviLncial districts of Luzon. Electric power consumption in
the area served by NPC-MECO grew at an average rate of 11.3% between 1960 and
1975; over the same period, GNP rose at an average of 5.8% a year, while the
population growth rate was 3.1%. Growth in electric power consumption and
GNP from 1960 to 1L975 was as follows:
Consumption Growth Rate         GNP Growth Rate
Period               % per year                  % per year
1960-19165               14.5                         5.4
1965-1970                12.3                         5.4
1970-1975                 7.2                         6.5
3.03       The drop in the growth rate in the last five-year period was a
result of a drastic fall in consumption in 1974 (-1%) by comparison with
1973. The fall was due to severe restriction in consumption and an increase
in tariffs applied in the Manila metropolitan area following the rise in
international oil prices. Nevertheless, the Luzon market recovered quickly,
the consumption growth rate reaching 12.2% in 1975 and 8% in 1976.
3.04       A summary of development  in the integrated Luzon market is given
below:
Peak Demand    Generation (Gwh)           Losses        Consumption  Load Factor
Year      MW          MECO   NPC   Total    Gwh        %          Gwh             %
1960       368        981    869  1,850      256   13.8         1,594           57
1965       671      2,514    989  3,503    371   10.6           3,132           60
1970    1,120       4,771  1,373  6,144    545    8.9           5,599           63
1975    1,481       6,873  1,669  8,542    601    7.0           7,941           66
3.05       The load factor in the Luzon integrated system is high owing to
the fact that industrial consumption predominates and that there have been
certain restrictions on peak-hour demand in recent years. MECO's losses in
transmission and clistribution (9%), and NPC's in transmission (5.8%), are
reasonable and have decreased as a whole from 14% in 1960 to 7% in 1976.
Small producers in Luzon as well as in the Visayas and Mindanao generally
show high losses ('over 20%).
3.06       Statistical data on development in electric power production and
consumption in the Visayas and Mindanao, is extremely sketchy and unreliable.
Some data on energy production over the 1970-76 period are given below:

1974       5         421       1,400      1,250     1,405       1,671
1976        9        814       1,764      1,159     1,773       1,973
The Forecast
3.07      Demand forecasts in the Luzon grid prepared by NPC and MECO
foresee a growth rate of 10.0% annually for the period 1977-81, which
seems reasonable. Provincial demand is estimated to rise 15% per year,
while demand in the Manila metropolitan area is expected to grow at 7.8% a
year. Lahmeyer International, the German consulting firm now reviewing
the future generating expansion program for the Luzon mainland, has estimated
the power demand growth rate at 11.5% through the 1977-85 period, which is
considered optimistic. This forecast is based on a correlation between
economic and population growth and the associated increase in power energy.
Reasonable demand growth (Gwh) in the Luzon interconnected grid based on an
annual growth rate of 10%, is shown in Table 3.1 and summarized below:
Sales              Generation Requirements
MECO    NPC      Total          MW         Gwh
1976     6,316   2,244   8,560           1,591      9,353
1981     9,242   4,576  13,818           2,669     14,964
3.08      The existing generating capacity in Mindanao is approximately
554 MW of which 201 MW is owned by NPC.  Demand growth to be met by NPC
is estimated at about 40% a year over the next five years. The forecast
assumes that NPC would absorb the load of existing utilities and would
connect to its system some :industries with large power demands. Currently
demand in the region is increasing so rapidly that a large diesel installa-
tion has been committed to augment the existing hydroelectric generation
and avoid possible power rationing.
3.09      Existing power supplies in the Visayas subgrids depend almost
entirely on private utilities and captive industries (351 MW) which run
90% of the installed capacity in the region. NPC has launched a major
generation development program, starting with diesel plants and proceeding to
thermal, hydro and geothermal plants to meet th'e forecast growth in energy
demand. The estimated demand in the areas presently served or to be served



- 12 -
by NPC is forecast to increase from 52 Gwh in 1977 to 1812 Gwh in 1981. The
forecast assumes interconnection of networks on the individual islands
followed by interconnection of island grids to cover potential demand,
especially from current captive plant and several private franchises with
very high generating costs. Details are given in Table 3.1.
The Rural Electric Cooperatives
3.10      Energy sales from cooperatives accounted for 370 Gwh in 1976
with the following breakdown: 81% in Luzon, 8% in the Visayas and 11% in
Mindanao. Growth in sales by comparison with 1975 was 72%. Energy losses
accounted for 22% of generation and the energy produced by the cooperatives
was 81 Gwh (17%) of their requirements of 478 Gwh. The high losses were
mainly due to the fact that the old distribution networks acquired by the
cooperatives are generally inadequate and overloaded. NEA has agreed to
plan a program of rehabilitation of the old distribution networks to
reduce losses to a 12% average by the end of 1982. The plan will be sent
to the Bank for review by mid-1978.
3.11      Energy sales are forecast to increase from 460 Gwh in 1977 to
1,430 Gwh in 1981. The mission based its estimates of growth in energy sales
on the following assumptions: residential: 33 Kwh-month; commercial: 180
Kwh-month; industrial: 10,800 Kwh-month and others: 2,000 Kwh-month. These
figures give a weighted monthly consumption per consumer of 55 Kwh-month
which is about the present average consumption per capita in the majority of
towns and villages currently served by the cooperatives. Historic and
forecast energy sales (see Table 3.2) are summarized below:
-------- in Gwh ----
1974      1976       1981
Energy requirements       136        478      1,668
Energy generated           15         81        320
Purchases                 121        397      1,348
Losses                      31       107        237
Sales                     105        371      1,431
3.12      Although the rural electric cooperatives maintain monthly statistics,
NEA does not consolidate such data. Neither the cooperatives /1 nor NEA make
analyses in the short or medium term of their power markets or of likely trends
in consumption by categories and number of consumers. As is recommended in
para 2.05, the planning unit would assist the cooperatives in preparing five-
year plans and forecasts by the end of 1978 and 10-year plans by the end of
1979; thereafter all the plans would be updated annually. All the information
on cooperative activities would also be centralized in the unit.
/1 Only five coops did so for the appraisal.

4. PROGRAM AND PROJECT
General
4.01      The Rural Electrification Program in the Philippines is designed
to accomplish the Government's objective of bringing electric service to the
whole population by 1990. NEA, the national executing agency, has set late
1980 as the deadline for achieving its short-term goal of completing the
backbone or primary distribution systems connecting all the municipalities
within the area of operation of each cooperative. Medium-term goals, to be
achieved by 1984, call for the electrification of all barrios and for the
connection of approximately 4.3 million dwellings housing some 26 million
individuals. To enable every Filipino to have the benefit of power service
by 1990, the rural electric cooperatives would have to connect an average of
600,000 households a year between 1985 and 1990.
4.02      The rural electrification program for 1978-80 prepared by NEA
with the assistance of Stanley Consultants, Inc. (USA) is shown in Table 4.1
and summarized below:

1979    316       4,009         441,763            6,689               3,703
1980    183       4,531         436,137            4,100               4,087
4.03      Accomplishment of the targets set by NEA as a means of carrying
out the Government's objectives will depend to a large extent on the Govern-
ment's own capacity to make the necessary funds available on time to meet
local costs and the availability of sufficient skilled manpower to implement
such an ambitious program. According to NEA and its consultants, the country
does possess a large enough labor force with the skills and technical training
needed to accomplish the targets set. Government gave assurances that any
gap in the funds required for the construction of the program scheduled for
1978-1980 would be made available to NEA as required.
Generation and Transmission Facilities
4.04      The present generating capacity of the electricity cooperatives is
49 MW. A further 69 MW in diesel units is in the process of installation to
supply power in some areas not currently serviced by NPC. As NPC extends
its service and the cooperative systems are connected to the NPC grid,



- 14 -
smaller and less efficient plants will be removed and relocated on other
islands where generating capacity needs to be increased or in areas
without electric power service.
4.05      By 1980, approximately 4,072 Km. of 69 Kv transmission lines are
to be constructed. Since NEA's policy is not to duplicate the services
provided by NPC, the cooperatives would set up about 716 Km of transmission
lines in areas where NPC does not construct them.
Program Costs
4.06      The investment costs of the 1978-1980 rural electrification
program are estimated at the equivalent of US$228.9 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$112.9 million (49%). Details of the annual program
of investments are given in Table 4.2.
4.07      Program cost estimates have been based on estimates for a
standard project requiring 151 Km of primary distribution lines, 65 Km of
secondary lines and 98 Km of service drops at a direct weighted cost of
US$147 per consumer for the backbone system, US$126 per consumer on the
lateral primary lines and US$66 per low voltage connection. These costs
reflect September 1977 price levels. The standard project as described is
the average project individual cooperatives would execute in the various
regions of the country. Table 4.3 details costs of the standard project.
The Project
4.08      Scope.  The proposed project would help finance the 1979-80 program
of NEA, and comprises the construction of 230 individual subprojects of which
94 would be new projects and 136 would be expansion of the present distribu-
tion systems, including rehabilitation of some old distribution facilities
acquired by the cooperatives from private franchise holders or from
municipalities.
4.09      Objectives.  One of the fundamental objectives of the proposed
project is improvement in the standard of living of the rural poor, who
constitute the majority of the low-income population. Once a permanent
and reliable electric power supply is available, NEA, in conjunction with
the cooperatives, would go on to organize: drinking-water supply projects,
thus improving sanitation in the barrios; pump irrigation projects,
opening the way for increased farm output; small-scale industry projects,
generating new employment opportunities and reducing the rural exodus to
urban centers; and projects to promote electricity consumption by using
electric motors to power mills now operated by diesel equipment, which is
costlier to run and maintain. In addition, project construction work will
provide employment for approximately 12,000 individuals.
Description of the Project
4.10      The project includes the following items:
(a) 476 Km of 69 Kv transmission lines;



- 15 -
(b) 20,334 Km of primary distribution lines at 13.2/7.6 KV;
(c)  8,743 Km of secondary distribution lines at 220V;
(d) electric motors, pumps and machinery for load promotion;
(e) headquarters facilities, including warehouses for cooperatives;
and
(f) consultants' services.
4.11      The single-circuit 69 KV transmission lines would be mounted on
wooden poles 45' to 75' long, with ACSR conductors and a steel shield
wire; 4-unit suspended insulator chains and average spans of 110 m. The
primary distribution system would be mounted on wooden poles 35' to 55'
long, using ACSR-type conductors sized to meet the anticipated load
density, and pin-type insulators. The average span of the lines would be
approximately 65 m. Approximately 70% of the low voltage distribution
systems would be mounted on the same poles used for the primary distribu-
tion networks. Power transformer installations and distribution networks
have been designed with sufficient capacity to supply forecast loads for
about 10 years and also designed for a voltage drop of not more than 10%
under full load conditions. The design of the backbone system to cover
10 years' load growth to be constructed initially constitutes the least cost
solution. With other alternatives (for example to build the backbone system
to cover 5 or 7 years' load growth) the incremental cost to replace the
conductors for a larger size and the unavoidable shortages of energy in the
system would be an uneconomic solution.
Location
4.12      The facilities making up the proposed project would be constructed
irn various regions of the island of Luzon, the Visayas and Mindanao (see Map
IBRD 13281). The rural areas in the various islands to be served have all
been the subject of feasibility studies and they were selected on the basis
of the following criteria:
(a) proper timing, to ensure that NPC and the cooperatives will
have completed the generating and transmission facilities by
the time the distribution networks are to be energized; and
(b) consideration of the need to provide service to areas where the
lack or high cost of electricity has seriously constrained
economic development.
Project Cost
4.13      The estimated cost of the project is US$160.5 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$81.8 million, as shown in Table 4.2 and as summarized
below:

The base costs were prepared by NEA and its consultants and reflect September
1977 prices. Physical contingencies have been estimated at 5% for materials
and 8% for civil works. Price escalation has been calculated on the basis of
an assumed inflation rate of 7.5% from 1977 to 1979 and 7% thereafter for
foreign costs and 8% for local costs.
Financing
4.14      A Bank loan of US$60.0 million is proposed, which would finance the
foreign exchange costs as follows:

NEA expects to finance from other external sources the balance of US$21.8 mil-
lion of the foreign exchange costs which will be needed in 1980 to complete
the 1979-80 program. OECF is expected to finance NEA's program in the
Cagayan Valley and NEA has been discussing the possibility of additional
financing with other external sources. Local costs (US$78.7 million equiva-
lent) would be financed by the Government through equity contributions to
NEA. The Government gave assurances that any gap in the local or foreign
funds required for the 1978-80 program would be made available to NEA
as required.
Engineering and Construction
4.15      The electric cooperatives will use the services of the following
four local architecture and engineering (A&E) firms for engineering design
and construction supervision of the physical facilities: Trans-Asia,
Adrian Wilson Inc., DCCD Engineering Corp., and Engineering and Development
Corporation of the Philippines. These firms have gained considerable
experience in the design and construction of distribution systems during
the first five years of program implementation. The firms will be supervised
by NEA, with the assistance of Stanley Consultants Inc. of the United States.
In addition, NEA would engage outside expertise for specialized tasks in
management and engineering to improve the administration of the project
during construction as required.
4.[6      In general, the transmission lines and the backbone distribution
system would be built by independent contractors. The lateral lines from the
backbone and the service drops to the consumer connections would be undertaken
by the cooperatives on force account./l Each contractor would use one or two
teams of workers with an average of 100 men per subproject. Each cooperative

would employ between 50 and 70 laborers. The construction period for each
subproject would range between 4 and 11 months, depending on the scope of the
works; the average rate of progress would be 1.5 km a day for contractors
and 1 km a day for cooperatives on the backbone system. onstrucLoil of the
project would start: at the beginning of 1979 and would be completed in the
last quarter of 1981.
Procurement
4.17      Contracts for procurement of equipment and materials of more
than $50,000 to be financed by the proposed loan would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines for procurement. For purposes of bid comparison, a preference
limited to 15% of the c.i.f. price of imported goods, or the customs duty,
whichever is lower, will be extended to qualified local manufacturers.
Contracts for materials and equipment of less than $50,000 up to an aggregate
limit of $350,000, and civil works contracts (which the Bank would not
finance) will be tendered on a competitive basis in accordance with NEA's
normal procedures, which are satisfactory to the Bank.
4.18      NEA will act as the procurement agent for all goods and related
services required Eor the project. NEA will allocate materials to the
cooperatives on a cost plus handling and freight basis, but each cooperative
would be responsible for storing these materials in its warehouse. NEA plans
to issue invitations to bid for the first materials and equipment contract
($14,000,000) after the proposed loan has been approved by the Bank. The
first partial delivery is expected to arrive in the Philippines in November/
December 1978. NEA and its consultants estimate that in order to avoid
shortages of materials during the construction of backbone systems and
rapidly increasing household connections, about US$10 million in stocks of
materials would be required.
Disbursements
4.19      Funds from the proposed loan would be disbursed against 100% of
the c.i.f. cost of imported equipment and materials, 100% of the ex-factory
cost of locally-procured equipment and materials, and 65% of foreign equipment
procured locally, and 100% of the cost of services of consultants. The
following table shows estimated loan disbursements.

The closing date would be December 31, 1981, three months after the estimated
completion of the project, to allow for some unexpected delays.
4.20      As execution of the rural electrification program is a continuous
process, any undisbursed amount from the proposed loan would be applied to
components of the program similar to those included in the project, following
consultation with the Bank.
Environment
4.21      A team of specialists provided by the Government of the Philippines
Inter-Agency Committee onl Ecological Studies (ICES) is preparing an assessment
of possible adverse consequences for the environment arising out of the rural
electrification program. This study is expected to be completed soon; no
adverse impact on the project is expected.  NEA will submit this study by
June 30, 1978 for review by the Bank and consideration would be given at that
time as to which of its recommendations, if any, should be incorporated in
the project.

5. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
NEA: Past Results and Financial Position:
5.01      NEA's annual accounts were compiled on a government departmental
style until 1973 which focused on the budget aspect of operations and did
not distinguish between capital and recurring expenditures.  Following the
incorporation of NEA as a government corporation, commercial accounts
comprising income statements and balance sheets have been prepared since
1974.  Income statements and balance sheets for 1974-76 are shown in Table 5.1.
5.02      In the past, foreign funds have been received from USAID loans;
Japanese reparations which Government has passed to NEA as equity; local
funds have also been provided by government as equity. A summary of NEA's
December 1976 balance sheet is as follows:

5.03      Authorized capita:L is currently 1 2 billion (US$270 million) which
should suffice through 1982 when the limit may need to be increased.
5.04      Loans receivable at end-1976 were made up as shown below:

761.4    102.9    100.0
An additional P 8.0 million (US$1.2 million) of amortization on loans was
overdue for payment, mainly for loans to private and municipal utilities
that had stopped payment in anticipation of being taken over by a cooperative.
Such loans are repaid to NEA from the compensation payable to the owners for
the assets on takeover. If the amount of the compensation does not cover the
outstanding loan, collateral assets do so.
5.05      Most of the new cooperatives are within the five-year grace period
of the loans made to them; a pattern of repayment performance has therefore
not yet emerged. While there is some variation in the performance of individual
cooperatives, NEA has been successful in ensuring that the cooperatives follow
efficient operating procedures and has established reasonable standards for
setting tariffs. If some of the cooperatives have difficulty in servicing
their loans, NEA has the authority and will consider steps to alleviate the
position of the financially weaker cooperatives. These steps include the
merging of less viable cooperatives into larger cooperatives and some cross-
subsidization to enable the smaller cooperatives to meet their financial
obligations while keeping tariffs at reasonable levels. Both the Bank and
NEA will closely monitor this aspect of the program.
5.06      A substantial portion of NEA's expenditures to date, although of a
recurring nature, have long-term benefits. P 32.4 million (US$4.4) of such
expenditures had been capitalized at end 1976 for write off over 40 years.
In the circumstances the procedure is correct and acceptable to the Bank.
NEA - Future Position
5.07      NEA has performed services in the past which it has not charged to
the cooperatives; it proposes to charge for its services in the future.
Operating expenses have been less than 92% of interest and other operating
revenues in the past but are forecast not to exceed 90% through 1982 as NEA
intends to take steps to increase interest rates and shorten repayment
periods. The pattern of such lending will not emerge until follow-up loans



- 22 -
are made to individual coops at the higher interest rates that will be decilded
for each individual coop when the loans are made. Forecast Income and Funds
Flow Statements and Balance Sheets are given in Table 5.2
Financing Plan
5.08      NEA's lending program is much greater than anything that has
been accomplished in the past, mainly due to the electrification program
gearing up over the next few years. It will lend at least P 3,282 million
(US$444 million) through 1982, about four times the accumulated loans at end
1976; in addition about P 52 million (US$7 million) will be required to meet
NEA's equipment and development expenditures making capital requirements
through 1982 an aggregate of 1 3,334 million (US$450 million). To finance
this amount, about 59% would be borrowed abroad; government equity would
provide 37%; and internal cash generation would provide 6% as shown in the
financing plan which follows:

Loans to be made and
capital investment                      3,334       450    100.0
5.09      The proposed Bank loan of P 444 million (US$60 million) and the
already committed P 17 million (US$2 million) from Loan 1120-PH amounts to
about 14% of NEA's capital requirements and 23% of the foreign borrowing
needed through 1982; USAID has committed P 355 million (US$48 million), or
18%; French suppliers credits of P 135 million (US$ 18 million) for diesel
engines and transmission equipment will provide another 7%; OECF credits of
P 292 million (US$39 million) or 15% are expected to be available for expen-
ditures in the Cagayan Valley; a further P 225 million (US$30 million), or



- 23 -
11%, may come from ADB; about FL 45 million (US$6 million), or 3%, is antici-
pated from KFW; and P 457 million (US$62 million), or 23%, remains to be
arranged. No difficulty is expected in doing so as NEA is already in contact
with other external sources, and the Bank may provide additional funds
towards the end of the five-year period. Government has provided local funds
as equity in the past and has guaranteed the program through 1980 (see para
4.03), the period of the Bank-financed project.
NEA's Future Operating Results
5.10      NEA's future financial position is expected to remain sound; annual
operating expenses and interest are not expected to exceed 90% of revenues;
debt service coverage on an annual basis is expected not to be below 1.5
times (1978); the debt/equity ratio is expected to reach a maximum of
53J47 in 1982; and the current ratio is not anticipated to fall below 7.0
(1982). However, in order to help safeguard the financial situation, it was
agreed the Government would indemnify NEA for any additional costs for
servicing the proposed loan arising from fluctuations in exchange rates.
Cooperatives: Past Results and Financial Position
5.11      Almost all the 73 operating cooperatives are still within the first
five years of operation; some only began operating recently while others
began operation on various dates back to 1972. The degree of financial
viability depends on the stage of development and the consequent household
incomes of each cooperative area. Each cooperative fixes its tariffs to
produce the revenues it requires (see para 2.17). The coops remain finan-
cially viable because of this and because interest is financed during the
five-year grace period to keep tariffs down to acceptable levels.
5.12     In view of the short history of the cooperative system an analysis
of past results would not, however, be indicative of future performance and
this will need to be carefu:Lly monitored.
Cooperatives - Future Position
5.13      Financial plans for five years are currently available for five
coops only, again because of the concentration on establishing the program
and the coops. A covenant is included in the proposed loan agreement that
five-year plans will be available for all coops by end 1978 and ten-year
plans by end 1980 (see para 2.05). The five coops for which plans are
available, however, are repcesentative of the whole: two very viable entities
in well developed areas - Pampanga and Benguet; one coop of average viability
- La Union; and two of poor viability - Ilocos Norte, which is connected to
the NPC grid and covers one of the least developed areas of Luzon, and
Catanduanes, which obtains its power from its own diesel generation and is
located on a small island off Southern Luzon.
5.14      The forecasts which are discussed below, have been based on the
physical and financial plans prepared by the coops and reviewed by NEA.
Figures are based on the individual towns and villages to be connected
through 1982 with forecast MW loads and Kwh sales expected for existing and



- 24 -
future residential, commercial, industrial and public lighting consumers.
Capital and operating expenditures have been estimated to provide and operate
the re'5  plant and services for these consumers.  The forecasts assume 7%
p.a. inflation and net operating assets have been revalued on that basis.
Detailed assumptions in the financial forecasts are given in Annex 2.
Pampanga Rural Electric Cooperative
5.15      Energy sales are expected to increase from 46 Gwh in 1977 to 187 Gwh
in 1982, an average annual rate of growth of 33%; average tariffs, based on a
rate of return on net fixed assets in operation of 8% p.a., are expected to
increase from P 0.38 (USJ5.1) in 1977 to P 0.51 (USA6.9) in 1982 at current
prices and in real terms are expected to decrease to p 0.34 (USJ4.6) in 1982.
Contributions to construction are forecast to average 25% over the five
years; the debt/equity ratio is expected to fall from 85/15 in 1977 to
66/34 by 1982. Pampanga is financially viable by any standards and should
continue to prosper.
Benguet Electric Cooperative
5.16      Benguet includes the city of Baguio in its franchise area and is
also a viable cooperative. Energy sales are expected to increase from 66 Gwh
in 1977 to 87 Gwh in 1982; tariffs based on an 8% rate of return on revalued
net fixed assets in operation, are forecast to increase from P 0.33 (USd4.5)
(USd6.6.) to P 0.48 in current prices which is equal to P 0.32 (USd4.3) the
1977 average, in real terms. Contributions to construction are expected to
average about 41%; debt/equity ratios are expected to fall from 71/29 in 1977
to 48/52 in 1982; ard current ratios are forecast to be about 2.1 throughout
the forecast period. Benguet like Pampanga is financially viable and both
these cooperatives should have no difficulty in supplying all power demands
at acceptable tarifE levels.
La Union Electric Cooperative
5.17      La Union coop's energy sales are forecast to increase from 16 Gwh
in 1977 to 88 Gwh in 1982, an average annual growth rate of 42%; average
tariffs are expected to range from P 0.37 (USV5.0) in 1977 to P 0.50
(USA6.8) in 1982 or about the same level as Pampanga and Benguet. The
results for 1978 are based on NEA's requirement that coops should earn 50% of
the debt service in the fifth year of operation - 1979 in La Union's case;
results for the folLowing years are based on rates of return of about
3%, 5%, 7%, and 8% on revalued net fixed assets in operation. Contributions
to construction on this basis increase to 46% annually by 1982; the debt/
equity ratio falls to 61/39; but the current ratio falls to 0.9 as borrowings
of about P 7 million (US$ 1 million) over those currently programmed will be
needed to cover the funds required for La Union's development program.



- 25 -
Ilocos Norte Rural Electric Cooperative
5.18      Energy sales are expected to grow from 16.5 Gwh to 40.6 Gwh, 1977
through 1982 or at an average annual growth rate of 19%. Tariffs required,
based on rates of return of 3% rising to 8% on revalued net fixed assets in
operation are forecast to double at current prices, from P 0.42 (USd5.7) to
P 0.84 (USil.4) or to P 0.56 (USd7.6) in real terms. Borrowings currently
programmed would require to be increased by at least P 12 million
(US$1.6 million) to cover the cash deficits in the funds flow. Ilocos Norte
Coop because of being located in an underdeveloped area, would require
assistance in ways not currently programmed by NEA if the financial situation
is to remain acceptable and average tariffs are to be kept down to reasonable
levels.
Catanduanes Electric Cooperative
5.19      Energy sales for this island coop are expected to increase from
3.9 million Kwh in 1977 to 19 million Kwh in 1982; average tariffs based on
graduated rates of return to reach 8% are forecast to increase from P 0.96
(USa 13.0) in 1977 to P 1.27 (US17.2) per Kwh in 1982 in current prices and
to reduce to P 0.85 (USi11.4) in real terms. The current tariff is P 0.50
(USi6.8) on average. The projected tariffs are increasingly high and some
ameliorating action is required to assist the consumers of Catanduanes Coop
(See para 2.18).
General
5.20      The sample financial forecasts discussed reveal that some coops
will be able to yield acceptable rates of return.  Other coops, however,
will need special assistance to keep their tariffs down to acceptable
levels. This may be accomplished by shortening lending terms and increas-
ing interest rates to prosperous coops and transferring the funds so
generated within NEA to less prosperous coops by giving them soft terms
for borrowing. Some cases may require equity to be given as grants; and
other coops may need to be merged with their more prosperous neighbors.
5.21      A definite policy cannot be evolved until five-year and preferably
ten-year plans for all coops are available so that the overall position can
be consolidated for the country as a whole. Any decisions on adjusting
tariffs to make average levels more equitable among coops will need to await
the outcome of the ongoing study of power sector tariffs financed under Loan
1460-PH of 1977 to NPC. However, in order to safeguard NEA's position, to
assure the continued financial viability of the rural electrification program,
and that consumers pay for power at tariff rates that approach economic cost,
it was agreed during negotiations that NEA would generally follow and cause
the coops to follow the financial policies outlined in Annex 3. The issuance
of the policy statement by NEA is a condition of effectiveness of the pro-
posed loan.

6. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
Power Demand
6.01      The load forecast prepared by the coops and NEA estimated
residential, commercial, industrial and other power needs. Peak demand
is expected to increase from , MW in 1978 to 2,469 MW by the year 2010, an
average annual rate of about 20%; energy consumption is forecast to increase
from 18 Gwh for 1978 to 9,870 Gwh by 2010, an average annual rate of about
22%. Growth is rapid in the early years, then tapers off as all the latent
demands are satisfied. A profile of the area is given in Table 6.1.
Scope of Economic Analysis
6.02      For the purpose of the economic analysis, the eighty coops that
will construct backbones, laterals and service drops over the next two years
were selected as representative of the RE program as a whole. These coops
are expected to energize over one-third of the towns and villages in the
Philippines by the end of 1984.
Internal Economic Rate of Return
6.03      As a proxy for benefits, direct revenues attributable to the
project were calculated, based on the 1977 weighted average border prices per
kWh paid by customers of existing cooperatives.  The only indirect benefit to
be quantified was the savings that would be generated by replacing kerosene
with electricity.  Since the net savings on kerosene captures only a part of
the consumers' surplus, the benefits are considerably understated. Forecast
demand and energy consumption are shown in Table 6.2 and the 1976 sale price
by coops in Table 6.3.
6.04      Using NPC's marginal cost of power (see Table 6.4) and the incre-
mental costs of investment and operation less taxes, all at 1977 border
prices, (Table 6.5) the IRR is about 22%; if demand drops by 10%, the IRR
would be 17%; if costs increase by 10%, it would be 18%.
6.05      The IRR given above is the minimum based on the benefits which
have been quantified. Substantial additional benefits will be gained because
most of the beneficiaries are among the lowest income groups in the country
(55% are farmers and 80% live in rural areas). The coming of electricity
will mean less drudgery at home; longer working hours on farms when required
during peak planting and harvesting seasons; higher productivity in local
industries; increased use and improvement of schools; better water supplies
and health facilities; and a significant improvement in life style.

Assumptions in Financial Forecasts, dated March 19 1978
A. NEA
1.        Coops Interest:  is assumed at 2.75% for existing loans and first
loans to coops and at 5% thereafter. Interest for diesel equipment from the
French loan at the amount paid; coops receiving these loans will pay equiva-
lent terms.
2.        Other Revenue Items:  are as estimated by NEA including procurement
fees at 2% through 1978 and 3% thereafter.
3.        Operations:  costs of operations are as forecast by NEA on the
broad assumption that costs currently borne by NEA will be passed to coops.
4.        Depreciation:  depreciation for all equipment is on the straight
line method at 10% for most of the equipment including transport and 6.75%
for Other Property and Equipment. Development expenditure is being written
off over 40 years.
5.        Debt Service:  is based on the individual loans borrowed or assumed
to be borrowed by NEA. Interest financed for coop loans is as estimated by NEA.
Interest financed for loans borrowed is assumed for sources that usually finance
interest during grace.
6.        Loans and Investments:  are as estimated by NEA based on materials
and cash required by the coops to carry out the program.
7.        Borrowings:  are amounts estimated to be required for the foreign
costs of equipment and materials and interest financed during the grace
periods on certain loans.
8.        Equity:  is assumed at the amounts necessary to cover the finance
gap and provide adequate working cash.
9.        Current Assets:  receivables have been estimated in detail for each
item making up the receivables. Inventories are as estimated by NEA as
required to meet the program.
10.       Current Liabilities:  payables have been estimated at one month's
operating, one month's loan releases, and three month's interest.

B. Cooperatives
1.        Energy sales for each cooperative have been forecast based on the
planned connections of towns, villages and consumers, and the estimated loads
and Kwh sales they will generate.
2.        Revenues except for Pampanga and Benguet which are based on an 8%
rate of return, are forecast at the levels necessary to cover cash operating
expenses and cash operating expenses plus 15%, 25%, 35% and 50% of the sixth
year's debt service for the first five years of operation respectively, and
to earn a rate of return of 8% in the tenth year of operation.
3.        Operating Expenses
(a) Power Purchases have been taken at NPC's forecast price per
Kwh purchased.
(b) Operating Expenses have been predicted at 4% of gross plant
for operating and maintenance, P 40 (the 1977 average) per consumer escalated
at 7% p.a. for administration and 1% of revenue for bad debts.
(c) Depreciation has been taken at 3% p.a. of gross plant.
4.        Interest and Amortization are based on currently agreed and assumed
loans from NEA.
5.        Construction Expenditure has been based on estimates of the cost
of installation of equipment, lines, and plant required for the villages,
towns and consumers forecast for connection. Work-in-progress has been
estimated at 15% of construction expenditure 1977-79 and 10% thereafter.
6.        Plant in Service has been revalued at 7% p.a.
7.        Receivables were estimated at two month's revenue.
8.        Payables have been forecast at one month's power or fuel purchase,
one month's operating, 5% of construction and 25% of interest.

NATIONAL ELECTRIFICATION ADMINISTRATION
Stet'ment of Policy
1.        It is NEA's policy to conduct its operations, arrange to obtain
loan and equity funds, and to lend or otherwise provide funds to borrowers
under circumstances reasonably designed to ensure that: (i~ adequate working
capital and cash levels are maintained; (ii) operating expeases and interest
payable shall not exceed 90% of operating revenues; and (iii) cash generation
including operating income, depreciation and loan repayments shall be at least
1.2 times annual debt service. To that end, NEA will prepare and implement
financial plans annually for the current and following nine years which are
consistent with the achievement of these objectives.
2.        NEA recognizes that cooperatives should be expected to have earnings
sufficient to cover operating expenses, debt service and other needs such as
meeting part of the requirements for development from internally generated
funds. In the interests of achieving appropriate allocation of Philippine
resources for development, NEA intends to exert its best efforts to have
cooperatives fix and charge tariffs to consumers at levels that will recover
the economic costs of supplying power as soon as possible after commencing
commercial operations. Consistent with these criteria, NEA shall follow the
guidelines set out in its Policy Bulletin 401-A which provides that cooperatives
earn revenues sufficient to cover cash operating expenses for the first year of
operations, and for the second through fifth years, to cover cash operating
expenses and 15%, 25%, 35% and 50%, respectively, of the sixth year's debt
service on the initial loan Erom NEA to the cooperatives, which provides funds
for the first stage in a cooperative's development, generally covering
purchase of assets from existing utilities and/or the backbone distribution
system, including a few initial laterals.
3.        In deciding how much lending to provide for subsequent development
of a cooperative and how much the cooperative should be expected to provide
for this purpose from internally generated funds, and in determining the
terms (interest rate, grace period on repayment, and repayment period) of
such financing, NEA will be guided by the principle that cooperatives should
achieve as soon as possible after the fifth and not later than the tenth year
of commercial operation, an annual overall rate of return of 8% on revalued
net fixed assets in operation. It is currently NEA's policy to make initial
loans to cooperatives on the following terms: (a) 30 years, including five
years of grace, with interest at 3% p.a., for those cooperatives connected to
the grid of the National Power Corporation (NPC); and (b) 35 years, including
five years of grace, with interest at 2% p.a., for those that self-generate.
However, it is NEA's policy to make second and subsequent loans to the
cooperatives on terms with the period of repayment not greater than and the
interest rate not lower than: (a) 25 years, including five years of grace,



ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 2
with interest at 3% p.a., for those connected to the NPC grid, and (b) 30
years, including five years of grace, with interest at 2% p.a., for those
that self-generate. NEA plans in the future to reduce repayment terms and
increase interest charges commensurate with NEA's cost of capital and with
the increasng capacity of the cooperatives to service debt on harder terms.
4.        Studies will be undertaken of the financial circumstances of
cooperatives and the merits of merger, federation and varied lending terms as
possible means to avoid extremely large variations in electricity tariffs in
different rural localities.
For the purposes of this Policy Statement:
(i) "debt service requirement" shall be the aggregate amount of amorti-
zation (including sinking fund payments, if any), interest and
other charges on debt;
(ii) "operating revenues" for NEA shall be gross operating revenue from
all sources; and operating expenses shall be all expenses chargeable
in the annual income statement, excluding interest;
(iii) the annual rate of return shall be calculated by dividing the
cooperative's net operating income for the Fiscal Year in question
by one-half of the sum of the current net value of the cooperative's
fixed assets in service at the beginning and at the end of that
Fiscal Year, expressed as a percentage;
(iv)  the term "net operating income" means gross revenues from all
sources related to the cooperative's electricity operations less
all expenses of electricity operations, including administration,
adequate maintenance and taxes or any payments in lieu of taxes,
and provision for depreciation. Interest and other charges on debt
are not considered to be operating expenses for the purposes of
determining said net operating income; and
(v) the term "current net value of the cooperative's fixed assets in
service" means the gross value of the cooperative's fixed assets in
service less the amount of accumulated depreciation and consumers
contributions, all valued annually in accordance with agreed
indices or other means of valuation acceptable to the Bank.
