KORBA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
1. THE POWER SECTOR
Background
1.01      Planning for power in India has, in the past, been on a State-wise
basis, although, during more recent years, a start has been made to coordi-
nate planning on a regional basis with inter-State transfers of power. How-
ever, the sheer size of India's power sector, when compared with that of
other developing countries, and the increasing complexity of system operation
as ever larger power stations and extra high voltage transmission lines are
constructed to meet the developing load, mean that, if future demand is to
be met on an efficient basis, a more sophisticated approaclh to planning will
be necessary than has been the case hitherto.
1.02      The Government of India (GOI) recognizes the problems, and its
approach to future planning envisages a reform of the organizational struc-
ture of the power sector, centralized planning of generation and transmission
projects and centralized control of a national grid with the operation of
generating plant on a merit order basis, One of the first actions taken by
GOI in implementing this policy was the formation of the National Thermal
Power Corporation (NTPC) and the National Hydro Power Corporation (NHPC) to
construct and operate large thermal and hydro power stations and associated
transmission, and the decision to proceed with the construction and com-
missioning of several large thermal power stations of 1,600 MW to 2,100 MW
capacity located on coal fields and supplying bulk power to the States via
an interconnected 400 kV transmission system. The construction of the first
such development, the 2,000 MW Singrauli project has been started with IDA
assisting in financing the first stage (Credit 685-IN). I'he 2,100 MW Korba
development, which is the second large thermal power project, is the subject
of this report.
Previous Bank Involvement in the Sector
1.03      The Bank has made seven loans to India for power projects amounting
to US$179.5 million and IDA nine credits totalling US$596 million. US$315.5
million financed or is financing the construction of generating plant, US$23
million financed the purchase of construction equipment for the Beas hydro-
electric project, US$380 million was for high voltage transmission and US$57
million was for rural electrification. All the loans and credits for the
generating plant (excluding the Singrauli Thermal power project (Credit
685-IN)), the Beas project (Credit 89-IN) and the first two transmission
projects (Loan 416-IN and Credit 242-IN) have been completed. The Singrauli
project is still in the preliminary implementation stage and no disbursements
have yet been made; in the case of the Rural Electrification project (Credit
572-IN), disbursements to February 28, 1978 were US$10.3 million. Of the
finance made available for the remaining transmission credits (377-IN of



- 2 -
IMay 1973 and 604-IN of January 1976) funds have been fully committed in the
case of Credit 377-IN and in the case of Credit 604-IN approximately US$44
million had been committed by December 31, 1977 in respect of contracts
awarded or under issue.
1.04      The ongoing power transmission projects and the rural electrifica-
tion project are proceeding satisfactorily notwithstanding delays in initial
implementation and in preparation of specifications for the more sophisticated
load despatch equipment. The Singrauli thermal power project which is in the
early implementation stage is also proceeding satisfactorily. The issue of
invitations to tender for the major items of plant and equipment is currently
in hand.
Energy Resources
1.05      India's main commercial energy resources are coal, oil and natural
gas and hydropower. There are also resources of nuclear fuels, principally
uranium and thorium, and India's power program includes the construction
of further "CANDU" type heavy water reactors using domestically produced
natural uranium as fuel. Two nuclear power stations have been constructed
to date and a third is under construction. There are also some geothermal
energy sites, but the potential appears to be limited.
1.06      Coal is by far the most extensive indigenous fossil fuel; reserves
are estimated at 83 billion tons of which some 21 billion tons have been
proven. Additionally, total reserves of lignite at the Neyveli field in
Tamil Nadu are estimated at around 2 billion tons. If generally unworkable
coal, e.g. coal with high ash and moisture context is excluded, this estimate
of recoverable and saleable coal and lignite is reduced to something like
24 billion tons which, on a forecast country wide usage, would be adequate
for some 50 years under current assumptions of economic growth.
1.07      By comparison with coal, proven reserves of oil in India are
presently small. Exploratory and drilling activities to date have proven
an estimated 230 million tons on shore, and recent major new off-shore dis-
coveries west of Bombay in the Arabian sea have led to delineation of fields
with proven recoverable reserves of about 250 million tons of crude oil and
30 billion cubic meters of natural gas. Other reserves of natural gas, which
is found in India both alone and in association with crude oil, are estimated
at over 100 billion cubic meters.
1.08      The firm power potential of hydro-electric power reserves is esti-
mated at 41,000 MW which at a load factor of 60%, is equivalent to an annual
output of 216 TWh, of which some 8,000 NIW will have been developed by March
1979. Some 30% is in the North Eastern Region with the balance spread over
the Northern (25%), Southern (20%), Western (18%), and Eastern (7%) regions.
1.09      Oil and natural gas have important alternative uses and it is im-
probable they will be a significant factor in the generation of electric
power. Development of generating facilities for the foreseeable future,
therefore, will be based on coal or lignite burning thermal stations and
hydroelectric power stations with a small but gradually developing nuclear
program.

The Power Sector
1.10      The Indian power sector is complex because electricity supply is
within the concurrent jurisdiction of the Central Government and the State
Governments. The principal agencies in the industry are the State Electricity
Boards (SEBs), which are responsible for the generation, transmission and
distribution of electricity within each State and for the control and regula-
tion of private sector licensed electricity supply undertakings, the Atomic
Energy Commission, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), and the two
Central Power Corporations.
1.11      The CEA was formally created in 1950 with resporLsibility for devel-
oping a national policy for power development and coordinating the activities
of the various planning agencies involved in electricity supply. At that time
it came under the Power Wing of the Central Water and Power Commission (CWPC)
which in turn was under the Ministry of Irrigation and Power. As a result of
administrative changes introduced in October 1974, responsibility for power
was transferred to the Ministry of Energy which was created at that time to
bring together ministerial responsibility for coal and power. This involved
the transfer of the Power Wing of the former CWPC to the CEA, which now comes
under the Department of Power of the Ministry of Energy and is responsible for
national policy making in the electricity supply industry. For atomic energy,
and hence for nuclear power generation, there remains a sieparate Department
of Atomic Energy which comes directly under the Prime Minister.
1.12      The CEA had its powers enlarged in October 1976 and, in addition to
its general responsibilities for national power policies, is now responsible
for the formulation of plans for power development, training of personnel,
interconnected systems operation, research and development. It is also res-
ponsible for coordination of power planning country-wide to ensure that all
projects carried out by NTPC, NHPC and the SEBs fits into the overall national
program and the investments are made so as to be put to optimum use. Enlarge-
ment of CEA's power involved amendments to the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948
which were enacted into law on November 30, 1976. However, the financial
amendments, which concern SEBs are still with the Cabinet. It was confirmed
during negotiations that the proposed amendments to the financial provisions
of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948 had been introduced in the Indian
Parliament and that these should be enacted soon.
1.13      Although NTPC and NHPC have been established by GOI to construct
and operate large thermal and hydro power stations, this is principally to
augment the States' development programs. It is not intended that NTPC and
NHPC should take a leading role in the generation and sale of power in the
States. In most States the SEB will still be the largest power undertaking;
a situation which is unlikely to change.
1.14      At the present time, four large Central thermal stations have been
planned and, as stated in paragraph 1.02, work has started on the Singrauli
project which is the first of these. The next development is the 2,100 MW
Korba development with associated transmission. Both of these developments
will be constructed and operated by NTPC. NHPC, which will construct and
operate large hydroelectric projects, has taken over two hydro developments



-4-
which were under construction at the time the Corporation was established.
A transmission wing has also been established within this Corporation which
will design and construct the associated 220 kV and 400 kV overhead trans-
mission.
1.15      Planning of generation and transmission development, traditionally,
has been undertaken by SEBs, and there has been little attempt to evaluate
least cost methods of meeting demand on a regional or national basis.  However,
with the rapid growth of the power sector, about 11% annual rate of growth,
and with the resultant increasing complexity of operation, GOI has accepted
the need for an integrated national approach to sector development.  The tech-
nical, economic and financial aspects of developing regional and national
power systems require considerable analyses, discussion of alternatives,
determination of design criteria for uniform adoption and agreement among the
States and the Center on the broad principles to be followed. The operation
of such systems would require large numbers of personnel who would have to be
trained in the use of sophisticated load despatch equipment and interconnected
systems operation. A beginning has already been made on all these matters.
1.16      The unified operation of power systems on a regional basis has
already commenced. The Southern Regional Grid went into integrated operation
in August 1972 and progressive integration of power systems in other Regions
is intended to pave the way for an all-India grid. UNDP is assisting CEA in
establishing a systems operation organization and in developing programs for
training staff that would be needed to run the regional and national power
systems when they are established. Progress on this, so far, has been unsatis-
factory primarily because of personnel problems but the CEA and UNDP are
aware of the importance of the training activities and are trying to expedite
action. IDA Credit 604-IN (Fourth Power Transmission approved in January 13,
1976) includes provision to help finance the cost of consultants to study the
technical, economic and financial aspects of the long term national plan for
power development in India. GOI has established a committee to agree on the
standard design parameters to be adopted in developing the national grid which
will comprise initially a 400 kV network. Teshmont Consultants, Inc. of
Canada has been engaged by CEA to assist in the detailed studies for develop-
ing the 400 kV system. CEA is also simultaneously undertaking steps necessary
for the development of a 15-20 year plan which should include, inter alia,
detailed demand forecasts, investigations of power generation schemes to meet
load growth requirements of a 15-20 year period indicating cost and sequencing
to optimize resource inputs, development of primary grid configurations, co-
ordination of power plans with plans for other sectors, determining resource
requirements and recommendations on responsibilities and needed operational
policies at the state, regional and national levels.  Such a study is an
essential prerequisite for formulating sound policies for future development
of the sector. CEA has engaged Teshmont Consultants to assist in this study
also.
1.17      The organizations which are to construct and operate the national
grid and the status of work regarding the development of policies for the
technical, economic and commercial operations of the national power system
were discussed with representatives of GOI and CEA during appraisal and they
expressed a clear understanding of the need to arrive at policy decisions on



these issues as soon as possible. However, the 400 kV system studies which
are presently being carried out are basic to the ultimate establishment of a
national power system and following further discussion during negotiations
the representatives of GOI expressed the view that it is too early to formu-
late policy decisions on these issues. These studies, are being carried out
in two phases; the studies for the first phase covering the transmission
requirements for the next 5 years are nearing completion and the report is
due by April/May 1978. The studies for the second phase which will be based
on long term national perspectives are commencing shortly and should be
completed by the end of 1979. The Association representatives at negotia-
tions expressed satisfaction with the progress of the 400 kV system studies
and emphasized the importance of maintaining the momentum and the need for
early crystalization of proposals for operation on a regional and national
basis. This will be the subject of continuing dialogue during future
missions in the power sector.
1.18      It would seem that the eventual operation and control of the national
power system should logically pass to the Regional Electricity Boards with
overall control by CEA, whose function would be to optimize the operation of
generating plant nationwide on a merit-order basis. If such is the case CEA
would have to be further strengthened to perform the above functions and there
will have to be an improvement in its management techniq[ues if it is to carry
out its full participation in the areas of policy planning and coordination.
These matters will be the subject of continuing high level dialogue between
the Bank and GOI.
Existing Facilities
1.19      The total installed generating capacity for the whole of India at
March 31, 1977 was 21,927 MW. This excludes about 2,100) MW of non-utility
capacity, mostly thermal, which is owned by major industrial consumers to
meet their own needs. The generating capacity is shown in Table 1.1 below.

1.20      Intrastate and interstate transmission is at 132 kV and 220 kV
and, generally, major load centers are interconnected by 132 kV and 33 kV
sub-transmission lines. Distribution voltages are 11 kV and 415/240 V.
The supply is generally reliable but losses and unaccounted for, at around
20% of units sent out, are high. Around 12% to 15% should be an acceptable
average for India.
Future Development
1.21      The country wide peak demand in 1975/76 was 13,740 MW; this is ex-
pected to increase to 20,200 MW by 1978/79, with output in that year estimated
at 112 TWh. The planned expansion of generating capacity during the period
1974/75 - 1978/79 which provided for an additional 16,530 MW of plant (9,640 MW
thermal, 6,420 MW hydro and 470 MW nuclear), is not now likely to be achieved
and the target has been revised to about 12,500 MW which would bring the in-
stalled capacity by 1978/79 to 31,000 MW of which 28,900 MW would be utility
plant with the balance of 2,100 MW non-utility.
1.22      Preliminary proposals indicate that expansion of generating capa-
city during the period 1979/80-1983/84 is planned at some 19,000 MW bringing
planned installed capacity up to about 50,000 MW by 1983/84. The additional
capacity scheduled for commissioning during this period is shown in more
detail in Table 1.2. Additionally, the construction of some 15,000 circuit
kms of 400 kV transmission is planned to enable further integration of the
State systems and the evacuation of the output from the proposed large thermal
power stations over the expanding regional grid systems. Bearing in mind
experience during recent years these targets are likely to prove optimistic.

1.23      The Tenth Annual Power Survey of India forecasts an increase in
capacity of around 11,000 MW during the period 1979/80 - 1983/84.  This fore-
cast is based upon sanctioned generation developments as of March 31, 1977.
Table 1.3, which forecasts annual capacity and energy requirements, demon-
strates that, unless the remaining planned generation developments aggre-
gating 8,000 MW (see para. 1.22) are sanctioned, and can be constructed and
commissioned during the period 1979/80 - 1983/84, there may still be large

annual capacity and energy deficits throughout this period. These forecasts,
-which are based upon continuous monitoring of development trends during the
preparation of the annual electric power surveys of India, are realistic.

2. THE BENEFICIARY - NATIONAL THERMAL POWER CORPORATION LIMITED
2.01      The Borrower of the proposed Credit would be the Government of
India and the Beneficiary would be NTPC. A Development Credit Agreement
would be entered into between GOI and the Association, a Project Agreement
between NTPC and the Association and a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between
GOI and NTPC to cover the onlending of the Credit.
2.02      NTPC was established in 1975 under the Companies Act 1956, and
the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 has been amended to giveb the Corporation
statutory recognition. NTPC is responsible to the Government and has an
initial authorized share capital of Rs 1,250 million (US$145 million).
The Corporation is managed by a Board of Directors of not less than four
and not more than fifteen, some of whom will be part time.
2.03      The main objectives for which the Corporation has been established
are:
(i)  to design, construct, and operate large central thermal power
stations and projects; and
(ii)  to distribute and sell the power generated.
NTPC would initially own and operate the associated 400 kV transmission system
over which power would be distributed and sold in bulk to State Electricity



Boards, but this will eventually become part of the 400 kV interconnected
system forming the national grid.
2.04      NTPC presently plans to construct four central thermal power sta-
tions, one with a capacity of 2,000 MW, two with a capacity of 2,100 MW each
and one with a capacity of 1,100 MW (to be expanded ultimately to 1,600 MW).
The first to be constructed is Singrauli located on the coal fields in Uttar
Pradesh (Northern Region), the second is at Korba on the coal fields in
Madhya Pradesh (Western Region), the third is at Godavari on the coal fields
in Andhra Pradesh (Southern Region) and the fourth (ultimate planned capacity
1,600 MW) is at Farakka on the coal fields in West Bengal (Eastern Region).
It is also possible that NTPC might ultimately take over the 300 MW Badarpur
station near Delhi (ultimate planned capacity 700 MW) presently owned by GOI.
Bulk Supply Tariffs
2.05      Initially the Central thermal power stations will be associated
with the Regions in which they are located and are intended to augment the
SEB's generation development programs. Each central thermal power station
will, therefore, sell bulk power to the SEBs in the Region in which it is
located on the basis of the amount of power allocated to each SEB. This is
a short term philosophy as by the late 1980's or early 1990's NTPC's power
stations will form part of a national power system and will be feeding power
into an interconnected 400 kV national grid. The commercial policy for the
operation of the national power system has yet to be determined hence, at
this point in time, it is not practical to conclude definitive long term
arrangements for firm allocations of power from selected power stations to
specific SEBs.
2.06      The general principle of a bulk tariff which, ideally, should con-
sist of an annual demand charge per kW of capacity allocated based on total
fixed costs (which would be a minimum charge) plus an energy charge which
reflects short-run marginal costs was discussed with GOI at the time of the
Singrauli appraisal. This principle was agreed by GOI and it was also agreed
that from time to time such a bulk tariff would have to be revised to take
account of changes in both fixed and variable costs and to meet any increase
in the rate of return target. As in the case of Singrauli, GOI's proposal
is that 85% of Korba's power would be allocated, the remaining 15% being sold
in accordance with priorities, to be determined by CEA, to States with the
greatest need. An important consideration is to protect NTPC's revenues to
ensure that income from the sale of bulk power will be adequate at all times
to meet fixed and variable costs and provide the agreed rate of return. To
the extent that there is likely to be a continuing capacity shortage for the
foreseeable future, GOI's proposal outlined above would be acceptable for
the Project, comprising the first 600 MW of a planned 2,100 MW power station.
Nevertheless, NTPC agreed during negotiations to sell the output of power from
the Project to selected SEBs under bulk supply contracts satisfactory to the
Association. GOI explained, during negotiations, that the selected SEBs
(Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh) and Goa have already indicated
their willingness to purchase an aggregate of 850 MW of power from the Korba



- 9 -
development. This exceeds the output of the Project. GOI undertook to
obtain these commitments in writing from the three SEBs ancl Goa and send
them to the Association.
2.07      The Bulk Supply tariff would be based on marginal cost pricing but,
since determination of the appropriate level of tariffs has to be consistent
with the financial viability of NTPC, the tariff would be adjusted, as neces-
sary, to meet the financial requirements. This would encourage the recipient
SEBs to carry out marginal cost pricing studies and to mod:ify their own tariffs
and tariff policies accordingly. Maharashtra and Gujarat have already carried
out pricing studies based on marginal cost principles following agreement
reached under Credit 604-IN (Fourth Power Transmission Project) and GOI ex-
plained, during negotiations, that Madhya Pradesh has agreed to carry out a
similar pricing study. The report of the findings of this study will be
prepared by March 31, 1979.
2.08      The follow-up to these studies was discussed during negotiations
and the GOI representatives indicated that, at the conference of State Power
Ministers held on January 23 and 24, 1978, agreement was reached on the
appointment of a high level committee to review the financial workings of
the SEBs and to recommend norms of financial workings. This review would
(inter alia) examine issues connected with rationalising the tariff struc-
tures of the SEBs keeping in view the socio-economic objectives of economic
development. The marginal cost based studies carried out by the SEBs would
provide a useful input to this review. It is hoped that the Committee would
be set up early in the next financial year and would be asked to submit a
report within an initial period of six months. The Association will keep in
touch with the work of this Committee through future missions to the power
sector.
Organization and Management
2.09      NTPC's organization is shown in Annex 1.  Good progress has been
made in building up the organization since early 1976 when the Chairman was
appointed, and the principal departments have been established, including the
Mechanical and Electrical Design Departments which together form the Plant
and Equipment Engineering Group, the Civil Design and Systems Engineering
Departments, which form the Civil and Systems Engineering Group, and the
Operation Services Department. At the time of appraisal the number of staff
appointed was 220 which included a first intake of 36 trainee engineers for
the training program.
2.10      NTPC is developing along sound lines and has a Chairman and Managing
Director who is a competent administrator with wide experience in the formation
and development of large industrial undertakings. Providing there is no deter-
ioration in its management NTPC should, with appropriate expansion, be capable
of handling the present large development program.



- 10 -
Training
2.11      In India, training of engineers and operators for the operation and
maintenance of thermal stations has been inadequate and this has been reflected
in the under-utilization of generating plant with outages for periods longer
than normally required for maintenance. With the proposed growth of power
generation by 1983/84 involving an increase in the work force of some 40,000
highly skilled workers, the need for training cannot be too highly stressed.
2.12      NTPC places special importance on this aspect of its organization
and training programs are being developed by the Corporation which will in
due course, be backed by a training school equipped with simulators and
other modern facilities for instructing and training the operating staff.
2.13      The first generating units are not scheduled to go into commercial
operation until 1981/82 and the formulation of programs for the training of
operating staff is not of immediate importance. Consequently earlier train-
ing will concentrate on pre-operational spheres of activity such as Planning,
Design, Construction, and Management. Most of the activities so far are
related to the one-year professional engineering training course for fresh
graduates numbering 36 in civil, mechanical, electrical and instrumentation
engineering. Special emphasis is placed on on-the-job training. The meth-
odology includes classroom lectures, participation in group exercises and
discussions supported by direct reading, audio-visual presentations and plant
visits. Other training programs are currently being designed in Supervisory
Development, Management Development and Induction-cum-Orientation.
2.14      The proposed Credit includes funds for financing the cost of a power
plant training simulator which will be designed to represent the responses of
the 200 MW and later the 500 MW generating units in their dynamic responses,
interlocks and operational sequences. This is a highly sophisticated training
tool which can be made to simulate every conceivable operational contingency
and thereby train the plant operator in the correct procedures to meet each
such emergency. The simulator enables the operator to face crises with con-
fidence and helps in the more efficient and reliable operation of the plant.
This equipment will be installed in the training school which, on present
planning, is to be established in the Singrauli power station.
Accounting Systems
2.15      Good progress has been made in planning NTPC's accounting organi-
zation. It has prepared and introduced a comprehensive chart of accounts
which involves the use of codes designed to facilitate recording, classifying,
and reporting of financial transactions. NTPC has introduced and is main-
taining adequate records. It has employed accounting consultants, Messrs
A.F. Ferguson and Co. of Bombay India to assist in designing and developing
systems in areas of financial accounting such as plant accounting procure-
ment and inventory control and for financial reporting generally.



- 11 -
Audit
2.16      The audit of NTPC books would be made by an independent auditor
appointed by the Company Law Audit Board, on the recommendation of the Auditor
General of India. The auditor appointed would normally be a member of the
Indian Institute of Chartered Accountants and his audit report on NTPC's
financial statements would be subject to comment by the Auditor General.
Messrs. V.K. Mehta and Company, Chartered Accountants, Delhi were appointed
to audit NTPC's books which covered the first financial period from November 7,
1975 to March 31, 1977. NTPC has already undertaken, in connection with Credit
685-IN, to submit to the Association audited financial statements within
seven months of the close of the year to which they relate, together with a
certified report by the Auditor and a review of the accounts by the Director
of Commercial Audits. This has been restated in connection with the pro-
posed credit.
3. DEMAND AND MARKET ASPECTS
Demand for Power - All India
3.01      The demand for power in India has consistently besen greater than
available capacity, principally because of financial constraints and lack of
plant maintenance but also because of failure, through poor planning, to meet
the targets for bringing new plant into operation. Installed generating capa-
city reached 18,500 MW by 1973/74 compared to the target of 23,000 MW, and
load restrictions, which have been mainly directed at industry, have adversely
affected the economic performance of the country. This, together with the oil
crisis in 1973/74 and the failure of two monsoons were the main reasons for
the slow down in load growth during the early 1970's. For the 20 years or so
prior to 1970, sales of kWh had been increasing at an average of 11 - 12% per
year. The statistics shown in Table 3.1 below indicate that the average annual
growth rate slowed to just over 5% during the period 1969/70 through 1974/75,
resuming the previous trend with a growth rate of about 13% in 1975/76 and
1976/77.

3.02      The improved performance in 1975/76 and 1976/77 has been due to a
variety of factors, including better monsoons, commissioning of new capacity
and better utilization of existing plant. The national load factor improved
from 49.7% in 1969/70 to 52.2% in 1976/77. GOI expects a continuation of the
higher growth rate, and an average annual growth rate of about 11% has been
forecast through 1984. In view of the recent improvement and the long term-
trend prior to the 1970's, this forecast is reasonable for the short term.
Demand for Power-Western Region
3.03      Since Korba is installed in the Western Region, its power will be
allocated to the three SEBs in that region i.e., Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and
Maharashtra and Goa. The three SEB systems are interconnected at 220 kV
although the "tie-in" with Madhya Pradesh is at present weak, with one 220 kV
single circuit line between Satpura in Madhya Pradesh and Koradi in
Maharashtra and a circuitous 132 kV line to Bhusawal (Maharashtra). However,
the Korba-Bhilai-Koradi transmission system included in the Project (see
paragraph 4.06(c)) will provide a 400 kV interconnection between Madhya
Pradesh and Maharashtra and the 400 kV transmission associated with the
Korba development will ultimately interconnect all three SEBs. Maharashtra
and Gujarat SEBs and the Tata Electric Companies (TEC) systems operate in
parallel with routine exchanges of power.



- 13 -
3.04      Average annual load growth in Gujarat since 1970 has been in the
neighborhood of 10% and in Madhya Pradesh about 15%. In Maharashtra there
have been power cuts on a sustained basis since 1972 amounting to some 30%,
the brunt of which has fallen on industrial consumers. The result is that,
following a growth rate of around 10% per annum in 1970 and 1971, load growth
in Maharashtra fell to an average annual rate of around 5% during the next
four years. Industry accounts for about 60% of the sales; of electrical energy
in the Western Region; agriculture and irrigation about 15%. Table 3.2 below
shows the past trend of power consumption in the three States.

Note:  Maharashtra includes the TEC System.
3.06      The forecast power and energy requirement assumes that the generation
development program will be adequate to meet the forecast load growths. This
is unlikely and the Tenth Annual Power Survey for India, which is based on
sanctioned generation developments as of March 31, 1977, indicates that in



- 14 -
the absence of further sanctioned developments there would be a power and
energy deficiency varying between 15% and 20% in both Maharashtra and Madhya
Pradesh through 1983/84 and a small power deficiency in Gujarat of between
5% and 10% over the same period.
4. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
4.01      NTPC's present program of development comprising the four Central
thermal power stations: Singrauli, Korba, Godavari and Farakka together with
associated 400 kV transmission is part of the future power development program
for India which is described in paragraphs 1.21 through 1.23.
4.02      The Korba project is the second planned development in the series
of large thermal power stations, proposed by GOI, to feed into a 400 kV inter-
connected transmission system and supply bulk power to the SEBs. GOI proposes
to construct Korba concurrently with the Singrauli development but with com-
mencement of work and commissioning of units lagging about one year behind
Singrauli. In the case of Korba, major contract awards are planned for
September 1978 and commissioning of the last unit is scheduled for October
1986.
4.03     -The proposed site of the Korba development is on the right bank of
the Hasdeo River in the Bilaspur District of Madhya Pradesh, just downstream
of an existing barrage at Darri. The location is governed by its proximity
to the coal deposits in the Kusmunda Blocks and the adjoining irrigation canal
which can be used for the direct cooling system. The water would be passed
back directly into the canal during the irrigation season and when the canal
is closed it would be passed out into a pond for natural cooling. Studies of
the availability of cooling water indicate that the gross cooling surface area
available in the existing Darri reservoir at water level of 940 ft. is adequate
to sustain by pond cooling, the existing SEB plant aggregating 400 MW, and a
further 400 MW currently planned, plus the Korba development up to 1000 MW.
The Bango dam which is to be constructed about 20 km upstream of the Darri
barrage will increase the flow of water in normal rain years by an additional
flow of 2600 cusecs and in lean years by 2300 cusecs. This will provide suf-
ficient water for the total planned capacity of Korba (2100 MW) as well as the
total existing and planned capacity of the MSEB thermal power stations and
local industry. The construction schedule for the Bango project is expected
to be about 6 years which would match the requirements of the Korba develop-
ment. The Bango project, which is mainly for irrigation and which has been
approved by GOI, is estimated to cost about Rs 1,150 million (US$134 million)
of which Rs 600 million (US$70 million) would be charged to the Korba develop-
ment. An assurance has been given by the Madhya Pradesh Government that
water for Korba would have priority over all other commitments for supply
of water from the Hasdeo River and the Darri reservoir, including irrigation.
G01 advised, during negotiations that the Bango project has been approved by
the Planning Commission and will go to the Cabinet for approval shortly.



- 15 -
4.04      The present proposal for the Korba development is that the plant
will consist of 3 x 200 MW and 3 x 500 MW generating units. Notwithstanding
the rapid growth in generating capacity, presently 22,000 MW and expected
to grow to 150,000 MW by the year 2,000, GOI has been reluctant to move too
quickly to the next size of generating plant (500 MW) because of the risk
factor and lack of operating knowledge, even with 200 MW units (see paragraph
6.07).  However, as stated above, the second stage of the Korba development
provide for the installation of three 500 MW generating units (Singrauli
2 x 500 MW).  Initial orders for these units would be placetd by 1981 and
they would come into service at yearly intervals commencing in 1985.
4.05      Coal for the power station will come from the Kusmunda blocks at
Korba located within 3 to 5 kms from the power station site. Consumption
will be about 7 million tonnes per year when fully developed. The proposal
is that coal will be transported to the power station by double track unit
train.
The Project
4.06      The Project which has been selected as a slice of the overall
Korba development and which, on economic and engineering considerations,
could operate as an independent and viable project in the event construction
of the remaining units aggregating 1,500 MW and/or the Bango Dam is delayed
or deferred, comprises:
(a) Civil works comprising acquisition of land, construction
of roads, culverts, railways and other miscellaneous
preliminary works, power station and residential build-
ings, plant foundations, canals, ducts and other works
associated with the circulating water system;
(b) three 200 MW turbo-generating units and three 680 tonnes/
hr boilers complete with all auxiliaries and ancillary
electrical and mechanical equipment including coal trans-
portation and handling equipment and the switchyard;
(c) the 400 kV transmission system comprising two 190 km
single circuit lines from Korba to Bhilai, a 300 km
single circuit line from Bhilai to Koradi and a 200 km
interconnecting line between the Korba and Singrauli
power stations together with control bays and other
associated equipment; and
(d) a training simulator.
Estimated Cost
4.07      The estimated cost of the Korba 2100 MW power station together with
associated transmission is about Rs 10.9 billion (US$1.13 billion). The esti-
mated cost of the project as defined in paragraph 4.06 is Rs 3,490 million



- 16 -
(US$406 million), excluding interest during construction. On the assumption
that most contracts will be won by Indian suppliers, the foreign curren'-
component of the Project is estimated at Rs 458 million (US$53.4 million).
The estimated costs of the principal features of the Project are shnwn i;
the following Table 4.1 and in more detail in Annex 2.

4.08      The proposed credit of US$200 million represents 49% of the cost
of the Project. This should be applied to the cif and/or ex-factory costs
of all plant and equipment and the training simulator, and to the costs of
consultants appointed to assist in the design of the Project. Civil works,
plant erection costs, inland transportation costs, interest during construc-
tion and any other costs not financed from the Credit, aggregating about
US$239 million, would be financed by GOI in the form of loan and equity
capital.
Basis for Estimates
4.09      The estimates for the 200 MW units and boilers are based on the
quotations received late 1977 for similar plant for the Singrauli project
escalated by 7% to bring these to estimated base prices for 1978, the year
in which the Korba plant is to be ordered.  The estimates for associated
equipment are based on the latest cost of similar equipment which is
presently being manufactured in India. Transmission estimates are based



- 17 -
on the costs of 400 kV construction at various locations in India. A physical
contingency of 10% has been allowed on civil works to provide for unforeseeable
factors, and possible delay in project completion and a physical contingency
of 5% has been allowed on plant and transmission costs. In assessing price
contingency, it has been assumed that fixed price contracts will be obtainable
for coal handling equipment, and other associated E&M equipment. Base 1977
costs for such plant plus physical contingency have been escalated at 7% per
annum to the year of placing contract and then held constant; erection costs
have been escalated at 7% throughout the construction period, thus giving an
overall price contingency of 12% for coal handling equipment and 21% for other
equipment. Transmission costs and civil works have been escalated at 7% per
annum throughout the construction period, giving respective overall price
contingencies of 17% and 21%. The maximum price contingency of 25% embodied
in the Singrauli contract has been assumed for the generating units and
boilers for Korba.
4.10      The breakdown between foreign and local costs is based on the prob-
ability that local manufacturers will submit the lowest conforming bids for
major items of plant under international bidding procedures.
Status of Engineering and Implementation
4.11      The Korba development comprises a number of major works which must
be carefully co-ordinated to ensure efficient progress to completion; coal
transportation must be completed ahead of plant to ensure availability of coal
for commissioning purposes and likewise the transmission system should be
slightly ahead of the first 200 MW generating unit to facilitate commissioning
tests on the unit. The critical path construction charts shown in Annexes 3
and 4 set out the construction program for the power station and transmission,
respectively, on the assumption that major power station contracts can be
placed by September 1978 and transmission contracts by April 1979. NTPC's
implementation plan was discussed during negotiations and it was generally
agreed that these assumptions are realistic. Detailed design and engineering
has commenced and since Korba is, basically, identical with Singrauli, this
work, now started, should proceed rapidly. Land aquisition is in hand and
no problems are anticipated. Preliminary investigations have been carried
out on soil conditions at the power station site and avaiLlability of adequate
coal reserves in the Kusmunda block has been proven. Nevertheless GOI agreed,
during negotiations, to take all steps necessary to ensure adequate coal
supplies for the efficient operation of the Project by the time the first
generating unit is commissioned.
Consultants
4.12      At the time of the Singrauli appraisal it was apparent that in the
early years until NTPC had built up an experienced organiLzation, it would be
necessary to draw upon the experience of other project design experts such as
CEA and/or other consultancy organizations to supplement the efforts of its
own staff. In the event, the Thermal Design Organization (TDO) of the CEA



- 18 -
was appointed as prime consultant for Singrauli, and NTPC appointed a retainer
consultant, experienced in the design of large thermal power stations, to
review CEA's layout and design proposals and to assist in the more special-
ized areas of design. TDO did the detailed design work for the main plant
(generating units, boilers and transformers) and subconsultants were appointed
to carry out the detailed engineering for the support systems. In the mean-
time NTPC had built up its own organization to deal with the coordination of
inputs and to administer the Project. It set up a strong technical services
division and established groups to take charge of project planning, site
supervision, procurement, expediting and quality assurance.
4.13      The above arrangements were discussed during negotiations and it
was agreed that these could, broadly, be continued for the Project, the main
change being the appointment of TDO as principal review consultant, since
the detailed design of the main plant (generating units, boilers and trans-
formers) and specifications would be identical to Singrauli, with minor modi-
fications and these could be handled by NTPC. GOI also agreed during nego-
tiations that, as in the case of Singrauli, a retainer consultant, satisfactory
to the Association, and experienced in the design of large thermal power sta-
tions comprising 200 MW.generating units and above, would be appointed to
(i) review NTPC's basic engineering and design; (ii) assist in the more so-
phisticated areas of design and (iii) provide a back up review of specifica-
tions for generating units, boilers, transformers and other specifications
as required by NTPC and the Association._
4.14      There is also the question of consultants for the design and super-
vision of construction of the associated transmission. The Uttar Pradesh
State Electricity Board was appointed as consultant for the Singrauli asso-
ciated transmission, with the transmission wing of the NHPC responsible for
supervision of construction. This was, at the time, an arrangement of con-
venience which will not be practicable for the Korba Project since the trans-
mission is located almost entirely outside Uttar Pradesh. This matter was
also discussed during negotiations and agreement was reached with GOI and
NTPC that consultants satisfactory to the Association would be appointed
for the design and supervision of construction of the associated 400 kV
transmission.
Procurement
4.15      Procurement of all equipment to be financed from the proposed Credit
would be on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Association's guidelines. All bidding documents, including recommenda-
tions for award of contracts, would be prepared by NTPC with the assistance
of its consultants, and approved by the Association. Because of NTPC's con-
sultancy arrangements and to avoid problems of contract coordination the
invitations to tender for major plant contracts would be on a supply, deliver
and erect basis. This would include civil works in certain cases where these
cannot be disassociated from the plant contract i.e. coal handling, substation
structures, transmission lines etc. Local manufacturers would be expected to
bid for all categories of equipment.



- 19 -
A domestic preference of 15% or the import duty, whichever is less, would be
applied in bid evaluation. Local manufacturers are likely to win the majority
of contract awards, but to prevent procurement delays GOI agreed during nego-
tiations that, in the event the lowest evaluated bidder for any contract is
a foreign manufacturer, permission to import will be forthcoming without
further review by any agency of the Government. There are competent local
contracting firms in India and also manufacturing facilities covering most of
the equipment for the Project.- Therefore all work not financed wholly or in
part from the proposed Credit will be subject to local procurement procedures,
which are satisfactory.
Disbursements
4.16      Disbursements would be made against the cost of consultants and
against the cost of the equipment to be financed from the proposed Credit
on the following basis:
(a) 100% of the ex-factory cost of equipment procured in
India after international competitive bidding; and
(b) the foreign cost of equipment procured from abroad.
Any balance of the Credit not used after commitments have been made for all
items covered by the list of goods, could be used to finance Project erection
costs after obtaining the Association's agreement.  The estimated schedule of
disbursements is shown in Table 4.2 below.

The large disbursement of US$21 million by December 31, 1978 assumes that
major plant orders will be placed before that date.
Ecological Aspects
4.17      The Indian National Committee on Environmental Planning of the
Department of Science and Technology has indicated no objection to the Korba
Project on environmental grounds, and during negotiations NTPC agreed to comply
with all the environmental quality standards prescribed by this committee, in
the design, construction and operation of the Project.
4.18      Appropriate action is being taken during the Korba design stage to
deal with the principal environmental problems which are described below.



- 21 -
(a) Location
The proposed Korba power station is a pit head station
located in the industrial complex which is being developed
at Korba, and is remote from any urban area. Accordingly,
there are no problems in this area other than the need to
ensure the health and environment of the operating staff,
and the local industrial staff and their families.
(b) Stack Emissions
Electrostatic precipitators will be installed and the
stack will be of such a height that emitted particulate
matter will be spread over a sufficiently wide aLrea to
reduce the density of pollutants to an acceptable level.
The sulphur content of the coal is in the range of 0.3%
to 0.6% which is low and does not present a pollution
problem.
(c) Ash Disposal
The ash will be pumped as a slurry, through a pipeline,
to an ash dump area located on the West Bank of the
Hasdeo River. Water from the ash disposal area will be
discharged into the Hasdeo river. Tests at other loca-
tions have shown that this does not have any detrimental
effects on the ecological system and the downstream water
is fit for irrigation purposes.
4.19      With regard to the safety and occupational health of employees,
safety regulations for power stations, to which all operating personnel must
conform, will be strictly enforced. As far as noise levels are concerned the
turbine hall of a modern steam turbine power station, which is the noisiest
area of the plant, has a sound pressure level of less than 90 decibels and
is well under the maximum acceptable threshold for the normal 8 hour/day
shift worker.
Completion Report
4.20      In order to inform the Bank and the borrower about the performance
of the Project and the lessons learned during its execution, a completion
report is required following the closing date of the loan. This matter was
discussed during negotiations and NTPC agreed not later than six months after
the Closing Date or such later date as may be agreed for this purpose between
NTPC and IDA, to prepare and furnish to the Association a report, of such
scope and in such detail as the Association shall reasonably request, on the
execution and initial operation of the Project, its cost and impact, the per-
formance by the Borrower and the Association of their respective obligations
under the Credit Agreement and the accomplishment of the purposes of the
Credit.

5. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
5.01      Financial forecasts of NTPC's annual operations to FY 1989 are
presented in Annexes 5-8. They are based on an investment program (Annex 6,
page 2) which envisages the construction of four large thermal power stations
with a capacity of 7,300 MW, together with over 6,000 circuit kilometers of
400 kV transmission lines, at a forecast cost of over Rs 41 billion (US$4,790
million equivalent). The power stations are expected to be commissioned by
March 1987, together with 95% of the transmission lines.
Future Earnings
5.02      NTPC will not begin to earn revenue until the first 200 MW generat-
ing unit is commissioned about December 1981. Additional generating capacity
expected to be brought into commercial operation in subsequent years is set
out in Annex 5, page 2. Both GOI and NTPC agreed in connection with Credit
685-IN for the Singrauli Thermal Power Project that NTPC would achieve in
FY1988 1/ and maintain thereafter a rate of return of not less than 9-1/2%
on the original cost of its average net fixed assets in service and meantime
to set tariffs from the time of commissioning of its first generating unit
at levels not lower than the estimated tariffs necessary to achieve the re-
quired 9-1/2% return in FY1988. In view of the revised schedule for commis-
sioning plant, NTPC's first generating unit will not be in full commercial
operation until FY1989. For this reason GOI and NTPC agreed during negotia-
tions that NTPC would achieve a 9-1/2% return by FY1989 and from the date
its first 200 MW generating unit is commissioned it will set tariffs not
less than those estimated to achieve the required 9-1/2% return in FY1989.
5.03      Since the value of plant and the expense of operations will vary
over time, NTPC should review and revise its investment program and its
forecasts of future annual operations each year in order to determine a
revised forecast average price per kWh in FY1989 which would be used as
the basis for revising current tariffs. NTPC will be asked to do this as
part of its reporting requirements and to submit to the Association, not
later than two months before the first 200 MW generating unit at Singrauli
is commissioned and thereafter not later than February in each year, commen-
cing in 1983 copies of its financial forecasts including income statements,
sources and application of funds and Balance Sheets together with supporting
details of debt, debt repayment, interest, depreciation and the assumptions
used in preparing the forecast average selling price of power in FY1989.
5.04      The income statements (Annex 5) show the forecast average bulk
supply price would be 22.1 2/ paise (US cents 2.6) per kWh excluding fuel
1/   The first fiscal year in which the 2,000 MW Thermal Power Station at
Singrauli was expected to be in full commercial operation.
2/   The average price per kWh represents 19.6 paise (US cents 2.3)
for generation and 2.5 paise (US cents 0.3) for transmission.



- 23 -
surcharge, _a the basis of the FY1989 forecast.  This price is used to fore-
cast the an-:nual revenues each year from FY1982 through FY1988.  The initial
three years of operation show losses of Rs 42.5 million, Rs 140.5 million,
and Rs 186.2 million respectively, (US$4.9 million, US$16.3 million and
US$21.6 million) whlch would be an acceptable part of NTPC's orderly develop-
ment, and would be financed by GOI equity subscriptions. A forecast rate of
return of 1.5% on the net fixed assets in service would be achieved by FY1983,
rising gradually to 9.5% by FY1989.
5.05      The rate base is the average of the net fixed assets in service at
the beginning and end of each year. Inclusion of plant commissioned at the
end of the first year of operation exaggerates the size of the rate base, and
without adjustment does not produce a very meaningful rate of return. For
this reason the rate of return is not shown for FY1982. On the basis of
assumptions in Annex 8 forecast operating ratios would fall from 80% (1983)
to 70% in FY1984 and reduce gradually thereafter to 58% in FY1989.
Tax
5.06      NTPC's earnings are not expected to produce taxable profits until
well after FY1989 due to the annual depreciation on the declining balance
basis allowed for tax purpose in the early years of the lives of the assets.
Internal Cash 'eneration FY1977 - FY1989
5.07      Forecast sources and application of funds covering NTPC's opera-
tion through FY1989 are set out in Annex 6. Internal cash generation is
based on thermal generating plant operating at an average 5,500 hours per
annum when fully developed, on energy sales priced at 22.1 paise per kWh
plus varying fuel surcharges, and the cost of operations and maintenance and
depreciation forecast as percentages of the original capital cost of plant
(Annex 83
5.08      After commencinag commercial operations in December 1981, internal
cash generation each year would increase rapidly to Rs 4,712 million (US$548
million) by FY1989. In FY1982 through FY1984, internal cash generation would
not meet annual debt service and working capital increases, but the resultant
shortfall would be financed from equity capital subscribed by GOI. Thereafter,
cash generation would cover debt service at least 1.2 times uintil FY1989, so
that ample cash generation would be available to finance increases in working
capital.

struction to the extent described in paragraph 5.09, would involve forecast
capital requirements of Rs 34,651 million (US$4,029 million). The cost of
the proposed Korba Project is estimated at US$439 million equivalent includ-
ing interest during construction. The Association's proposed credit to GOI
for the Korba Project of US$200 million would be relent to NTPC in accordance
with an acceptable onlending agreement as a condition of effectiveness of the
Credit. The following terms would be satisfactory: final maturity in not less
than 20 years, including five years grace period and repayment in equal annual
installments of principal, together with interest at the rate Bank Group funds
are normally onlent by GOI to productive enterprises (presently at 10.25% per
annum). GOI would provide the balance of funds to complete the project.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that GOI would provide the balance
of capital, estimated at US$239 million, to complete the Project on terms
satisfactory to the Association, together with any additional funds which
may be needed. The overall cost of both the Singrauli and the Korba Projects
represents about 25% of the six year slice of NTPC's investment program. GOI
anticipates additional financial assistance to finance the balance of the
investment program partly in loans and partly in equity in a ratio which would
normally not exceed 50/50 (see para. 5.16).
5.11      The remaining part of the investment program covering FY1985 -
FY1988 provides for the continued construction of the plant. The following
table illustrates the growth of the internally generated ftnds, net of annual
debt service and the annual increases in working capital, Up to FY1989.

5.12      The increasing proportion of investment to be financed by intern-
ally generated funds reflects the limitations to the current investment pro-
gram. GOI is planning to develop other large power stations, and extend
the 400 kV transmission network, but these have not been included in NTPC's



- 26 -
investment program. As a result, surplus funds are shown in FY1988 and
FY 1989. Since a financially viable NTPC would be expected in due course
to finance a reasonable proportion of construction from its internally
generated funds, it should also have an obligation to commence paying
dividends on its paid up share capital. Its tariffs should be expected to
produce a rate of return which must eventually provide funds to do this.
Meanwhile, no amendment is proposed to the 9-1/2% rate of return to which
NTPC is already committed.
5.13      Arbitrary allocation of the surpluses in FY1988 and FY1989 is made
on the basis that appropriations to finance construction would equal about
25% of a continuing annual investment assumed at Rs 4,000 million. On this
basis appropriations for dividends would enable payment of a 3% dividend on
paid up share capital in FY1989. These assumptions merely identify a question
which needs to be considered and resolved in connection with some future
appraisal for Bank Group lending in which NTPC would be the beneficiary.
5.14      Future Finances
Actual and forecast balance sheets as at March 31, 1977 through
FY 1989 are shown in Annex 7. The following table shows NTPC forecast Balance
Sheets as at March 31, 1982 (end of year when NTPC becomes revenue earning)
March 31, 1984 (end of year following completion of the Project) and March 31,
1989 (the year in which two Power Stations should be in full commercial oper-
ation, with the Korba and Godavari Power Stations not having reached their
full commercial operation).

5.15      These forecasts show that by March 31, 1982, NTPC's capitalization
would be Rs 20,059 millions (US$2,332 million) divided between GOI loans
(including the relending of the Association's Credits) and equity in a ratio
of 49/51. By March 31, 1984, the end of the project construction period,
NTPC's fixed assets would have increased to a little over Rs 34,000 million
(US$3,980 million) and a debt/equity ratio of approx 50/50. Little new debt
is forecast after FY1985, hence the downward trend in the debt/equity ratio
to 37/63 by FY1989. By that time annual revenues from all plant would re-
present a little over 20% of the gross investment. Annex 7 assumes NTPC's
authorised share capital would be raised periodically to reach Rs 21,500
million (US$2,500 million) by FY1987.
Debt Restriction
5.16      The Companies Act 1956 (section 293.1(d) restricts borrowing by
the Board of the NTPC to within a sum equal to the aggregate of the paid
up share capital and the Corporation's "free" reserves (i.e. those which
are not set apart for any specific purpose), except with the consent of the
Corporation in general meeting. A debt/equity ratio of 50/50 would be
achieved by FY1984 after which, due to a tapering investment program, it
would reduce gradually to 37/63 by FY1979 (Annex 7). If, for any reason,
GOI decides to provide capital to NTPC in a larger proportion of loan than
equity, to produce a debt/equity ratio in excess of the present limit of
50:50, NTPC would need to give its consent by resolution in general meeting
to raise its borrowing ceiling. The financial consequences of any such pro-
posal should be carefully examined to enable consideration to be given to
the need to correct any adverse financial effects which could arise. During
negotiations NTPC agreed to inform the Association of any proposal to raise
its debt ceiling in excess of the sum of its paid-up capital and its free
reserves, before placing the proposal on the agenda of the Corporation's
general meeting.
6. JUSTIFICATION
The Need for the Korba Capacity in the Western Region
6.01      The demand for power in the Western Region and the inhibiting effect
on industrial growth of up to 30% power cuts in Maharashtra since the early
1970's have been discussed in paragraph 3.04. The underlying growth rate is
between 10% and 11% but Annex 9 which shows projections of energy requirement,
peak demand and installed capacity through 1984, demonstrates that additional
capacity coming on stream during this period will be insufficient to maintain
this growth rate. The presently planned expansion of capacity throughout the
region to 1984 (including the Korba Project of 600 MW) will support a growth
rate of 7%, and it is doubtful that the resultant shortage of energy and capa-
city can be covered by standby and spinning reserve during these years. Un-
less, therefore, further generation development projects are approved or actual
demand growth is less than forecast, power restrictions are likely to continue



- 28 -
in force through 1984. Korba is a base load power station and even if the
growth rate fell to 4% annually the extra 600 MW of capacity provided by the
Project would be needed.
6.02      The same arguments apply to the full 2,100 MW eventually planned
for Korba; the estimated date of commissioning the last unit is September
1986. Growth in demand is expected to tail off after 1983/84, so that the
average annual growth rate between 1977/78 and 1986/87 is about 9%. The
expected deficit is such that only 6% annual growth could be fully accommo-
dated; even if demand were to grow at only 3%, the full 2,100 MW would still
be needed. While demand projections 10 years or so ahead are obviously very
uncertain, these figures suggest that because of Korba's projected position
in the merit order ranking as a base load station, it is most unlikely that
this extra 2,100 MW of capacity will be underutilized for lack of demand.
Comparison of Alternatives
6.03      The justification for the Korba development is based on the needs
of the Western Region and other alternatives for providing this power were
examined. These were: (a) hydro-electric; (b) nuclear; and (c) smaller
coal fired thermal stations at load centers to provide the same amount of
power.
6.04      Dealing first with the hydro and nuclear alternatives, the develop-
ment of hydroelectric potential was ruled out because the most readily avail-
able and economic hydro sites that could supply the Western Region are to
be developed in parallel anyway; they are supplements and not alternatives
to the Korba development. There is one large undeveloped potential of about
1,000 MW on the Narmada River in Gujarat but this involves several dams; is
an expensive development with a long gestation period and would be subject
to agreement between the three States on sharing the waters (a time consuming
process) before feasibility studies could commence. The nuclear alternative
was eliminated because of the long gestation period (8-10 years for the
first unit).
6.05      The remaining alternative, the development of smaller coal-fired
power stations at load centers in the Western Region, was then examined.
For the purpose of this comparison, which is described in detail in Annex 10,
the costs of 700 MW power stations at Poona, Ahmedabad, and Bombay respectively
were compared with the Korba 2,100 MW development. The most important cost
differences were the higher transmission costs, which raised Korba's capital
costs, and the higher fuel costs which made operating costs for the alter-
native more expensive. Of the two, the Korba investment was shown to be the
more economic. The equalizing rate of return for the two cost streams is 29%
at market prices and 28% shadow pricing local labor and foreign exchange.
At a 10% discount rate, the present value of Korba costs is Rs 7,979 million
and the alternative is Rs 10,560 million.
6.06      These results are not unduly sensitive to significant variations
in the most uncertain factors of the two alternatives. Taking the most



- 29 -
pessimistic view (a 10% increase in the cost of Korba combined with a 10%
decrease in fuel costs at the smaller power stations) the equalizing dis-
count rate is 21% which is well above the opportunity cost of capital.
6.07      Another thermal alternative examined was the installation of
4 x 500 MW units instead of 3 x 200 MW plus 3 x 500 MW. On a straight com-
parison there would be savings in capital, operating and fuel costs. However,
the largest generating units in operation, until recently, were 120 MW units
(the first 200 MW unit was commissioned during the latter part of 1977).
Based on technical considerations it would be unwise and potentially more
costly to proceed, at this stage, to the 500 MW units with their more sophis-
ticated operating and maintenance procedures. Several 200 MW units are
presently being constructed in India and more will be in operation by the
time the first Korba 200 MW unit goes into commercial operation. On a risk
analysis basis higher expected costs would have to be associated with a first
phase of 500 MW units. These contingent costs are based on the greater like-
lihood of breakdown with the larger units resulting in longer outage periods
and consequent loss of revenues. This would not apply to the 2 x 500 MW units
in the second phase of the development as by that time generating units of
this size are likely to be manufactured in India and experience should have
been gained in their operation and maintenance. In fact GOI has authorized
TEC to install a 500 MW unit at Trombay Power Station (Bombay) and provision
is being made for a transfer of experience on this project to NTPC before
moving to the larger size unit for the Central developments. The foregoing
considerations favor proceeding first with the 3 x 200 MW installation and
justify this alternative for the first phase of the Korba development.
Return on Investment
6.08      The return on investment relates the additional expected revenues
(attributable to the Korba development) to the expected economic costs. Given
a tariff sufficient to earn a 9-1/2% rate of return by 1988/89, the return on
investment will be about 13%. This remains unchanged when labor and foreign
exchange are shadow priced. A sensitivity analysis of these results and a
fuller discussion of the assumptions on which they are based is given in
Annex 10.
Project Risks
6.09      The principal risk areas are in engineering design and supervision
during construction, cost overruns and extensive teething troubles during
the early operational stage with resultant loss of revenues. There is also
the risk of damage due to fire, explosion, etc., but this is covered by
insurance provided by the respective contractors during the construction
stage and by GOI through its self-insurance policy after commissioning.



- 30 -
6.10      With regard to the principal risk areas enumerated above:
(i) NTPC is being assisted by consultants and sub con-
sultants, who are competent in the different areas
of expertise, and this should ensure adequate super-
vision and coordination of all work from engineering
to project commissioning;
(ii) Plant and equipment cost are based on similar works
currently in progress in India; adequate provision
has been made for cost escalation and there should
be little risk of any substantial cost overrun;
(iii)  A number of 200 MW generating units will have been
in operation for some years before the Project is
commissioned, and, hopefully, teething troubles will
have been overcome.
7.  SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS
7.01      During negotiations the following issues were raised with GOI and
satisfactory agreement or assurances obtained with regard to:
(a)  obtaining written undertakings from each of the recipient
SEB's (Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat) and Goa
that they will purchase in aggregate 85% of the output of
power from the Project (paragraph 2.06);
(b)  taking appropriate action to ensure adequate coal supplies
for the power station by the time the first generating
unit is scheduled to go into service (paragraph 4.11);
(c)  permission to import without further review by any agency
of the Government in the event the lowest evaluated bidder
for any contract to be financed through the Credit is a
foreign manufacturer (paragraph 4.15); and
(d)  to provide the balance of capital, to complete the Project
together with any additional funds which might be needed due to
cost overruns or other unforeseeable factors (paragraph 5.10).
7.02      During negotiations the following issues were raised with GOI
and NTPC and satisfactory agreement or assurances obtained with regard to:
(a) the sale of the output of power from the Project to SEBs
under bulk supply contracts satisfactory to the Association
(paragraph 2.06);



- 31 -
(b) the appointment of consultants satisfactory to the
Association to assist in the design, preparation of
specifications and supervision of construction of
the power station (paragraph 4.13);
(c) the appointment of consultants satisfactory to the
Association for the design and supervision of con-
struction of the 400 kV transmission (paragraph 4.14);
(d) compliance with environmental quality standards pres-
cribed by the Indian National Committee on Environmental
Planning (paragraph 4.17);
(e)  preparation of a completion report not later than six
months after the Closing Date or such later date as may
be agreed between NTPC and IDA (paragraph 4.20);;
(f) informing the Association prior to any proposal to lower
the Corporation's borrowing restrictions under section 293
of the Companies Act being submitted to the Corporation's
general meeting for its consideration and decisiLon
(paragraph 5.16); and
(g) a rate of return for NTPC which would be not less than
9-1/2% by FY 1989 and thereafter, and meantime f-rom the
commencement of commercial operations and periodically
thereafter to set tariffs at levels not less than those
estimated to achieve the 9-1/2% return in FY 1989
(paragraphs 5.02 and 5.03).
7.03      The existing covenant (in DCA 685-IN) will be repeated in respect
of the annual financial statements which should be submitted to the Associa-
tion no later than seven months after the end of the financial year to which
they relate, together with certified copies of the independent auditors
opinion and the review of the accounts by the Director of Commercial Audits
(paragraph 2.16).
7.04      The onlending of the Association Credit in the f'orm of an accept-
able lending agreement would be a condition of effectiveness (paragraph
5.10).
7.05      Subject to the foregoing assurances the Project will be suitable
for a Credit of US$200 million.

supply operations for period FY1977 through FY1989. They include income
statements, with a supporting statement showing the capacity of plant, energy
generated and sold (Annex 5), source and application of funds, with support-

O&M Expenses
Power Station - 2.5% on original cost of plant
Transmission - one-half of 1% of original cost.
Depreciation
Power Station - 3.1% of original cost
Transmission - 2.6% of original cost
Note: Section XVII (8) of the 6th Schedule of the Act provides for depre-
ciation "from the beginning of the year of account next following
that in which the particular asset became available for use in
the business".
Tariffs
3.        NTPC has an obligation to achieve a rate of return of not less than
9.5% on the forecast average net assets in service by FY1989, and from the
commencement of its commercial operations in FY1982 to set tariffs at levels
not lower than those required to achieve a 9.5% rate of return on the fore-
cast data for FY1989. On this basis the average price of 22.1 paise per kWh
calculated on the FY1989 estimates is assumed as the average price for all
sales from December 1981.
Fuel
4.        The fuel cost is based on the 1976 coal prices per tonne shown in
paragraph 2 and escalated at 5% per annum to FY1982. 1/ Thereafter, a fuel
clause is assumed in the bulk supply contract to permit adjustment to meet
any further variation of fuel costs. The effect of any fuel price variation
is shown separately in the forecast expenses and recovered by means of a fuel
surcharge.
Rate Base
5.        Construction costs are based on 1977 prices escalated in subsequent
years at 7% per annum on civil works and at 7% per annum on Plant and Machinery
up to the year of placing the Contract which would then be firm. The average
rate base is half the sum of the net fixed assets in service at the beginning
and end of year.
Borrowing
6.        The proposed credit would be relent by the GOI to NTPC for a period
of 20 years from the date of withdrawal of the first installment including a
5 year grace period repayable in equal annual installments of principal
together with interest at the rate of 10-1/4% per annum on unpaid balances.
1/   An additional 5% cost is added for the fuel oil needed for starting and
low load operation plus 5 Rupees tax.



ANNEX 8
Page 3 of 3 pages
7.        Other capital requirements would be advanced by GOI in the form
of debt and fully paid up equity capital provided that the unpaid debt at
the end of each year would not exceed the sum of the issued share capital
and the "free" reserves, that is to say, those which are not set apart for
specific purposes.
8.        GOI loans (including the onlending of the proposed credit) are
assumed to finance either defined projects e.g. three 200 MW generating sets
including associated transmission which forms the Korba Thermal Power Project
or individual generating units and transmission lines included in NTPC's in-
vestment program. Interest on the loans up to the date of commissioning of
each unit of plant would be charged to construction, and subsequent interest
accruals would be charged to revenue. Repayment of principal is assumed in
15 annual installments commencing on the first anniversary following the end
of five year grace period.
Working Capital
9.        Variations in working capital represent the differences between
the sums of the individual items making up current assets less current
liabilities at the beginning and at the end of the year.
Balance Sheets (Annex 7)
10.       Current Assets
(a) Receivable are assumed at a level equivalent to
approximately one twelfth of the revenue for the year;
(b) Inventories are assumed are 1% of gross assets at the
end of the year.
Current Liabilities
(a) Current liabilities are assumed at a level of one
months fuel cost, plus 4% of the annual operating
and maintenance expense.

KORBA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Economic Justification of the Project
Selection of the Most Economic Alternative
1.        The obvious alternatives to the Korba 2,100 MW development are
hydro or nuclear. In the case of hydro the most readily available and
economic hydro sites that could supply the Western Region are to be
developed in parallel anyway -- they are supplements and not alternatives
and would, in any case, be too small, in aggregate, to be considered as a
comparable alternative. In the case of the nuclear alternative, the long
gestation period of nuclear power development (8-10 years for a first unit),
the technical problems in developing a 2,100 MW nuclear power station and
the attendent political problems eliminate this as a practicable alternative.
2.        Confining attention to thermal options, the alternative considered
was the establishment of three 700 MW stations. These were costed out at
load centers, based upon cost estimates for proposed SEB projects in the
Western Region. Operating costs were dominated by the high transport costs
of coal, which were assumed on average to equal the costs of rail shipment
from either the Singrauli or Korba coal fields to Bombay. 1/ This would
be reasonably representative if the three stations were at, say, Poona,
Ahmedabad, and Bombay. Capital costs were somewhat lower than Korba,
because of Korba's transmission component. The cost streams, at market
prices (net of identifiable taxes) are summarized in Table 1A (Korba) and
Table lB (Alternative).
3.        At market prices, the equalizing discount rate is 29.5%.  At a
10% discount rate, the net present worth of the costs of Korba is Rs 2,681
million less than the net present worth of the alternative. The sensitivity
analysis of market and shadow prices, summarized in Tables 2 and 3 show that
Korba is more economic than the alternative in all the cases considered.
The Return on the Investment
4.        The return on investment relates the expected revenues of NTPC
to the costs of Korba development. In a year of full operation, it is
1/   We may note that a third possibility would be to use Chandrapura coal,
which would costs Rs 65 per tonne to ship by rail to Bombay, as opposed
to Rs 83.5 per tonne from the Singrauli or Korba fields. This possi-
bility is fairly represented in the sensitivity analysis in Tables 5
and 6.



ANNEX 10
Page 2 of 6 pages
further assumed that the full 2,100 MW generating capacity will operate on
average 5,500 hours each year. The wholesale tariff that will be charged
on this basis of financial performance criteria is expected to be 22.1 paise
per kWh. Annual revenues assuming 9% station consumption and 2% transmission
losses will thus be about Rs 2,275 million.
5.        The cost streams for the project at market prices are shown in
Part A of Table 1. All the costs are net of identifiable taxes. The foreign
exchange costs have been estimated from those identified for the 600 MW Proj-
ect, assuming the phasing of costs will remain the same for the subsequently
installed units, and that foreign exchange costs will be about two and a half
times greater for the last two 500 MW units (33% as opposed to 13% of the
Project cost). Labor costs have been estimated at 15% of equipment costs
(based on manufacturer's statistics) and 35% of civil works. Total capital
costs in 1977/78 (year 1) prices are expected to be Rs 7,669 million, net of
price and physical contingencies. Operation and maintenance costs from year
13 onward have been estimated at 2.5% of total capital costs. Fuel costs
are based on coal at Rs 41 per tonne (net of taxes).
6.        On these assumptions, the internal rate of return is 13.0%, and
discounting future costs and revenues at 10% per annum, the net present
value of the Project is Rs 1,810 million.
7.        The most important cost components to shadow price are foreign
exchange and labor and a shadow exchange rate of 1.16 times the official
exchange rate, based on Planning Commission estimates has been used. It
was further assumed that about 70% of the market wage rate would fairly
represent the shadow wage rate. On these assumptions, the shadow priced
rate of return is 13.0%. Sensitivity analysis on this rate of return is
shown in Table 4.
8.        The above estimates of the rate of return cannot relate the costs
of the project to the value of additional power to the ultimate beneficiaries.
Retail level consumers are principally from agriculture, industry and serv-
ices, so that it is only through their final product that the bulk of power
generated reaches the ultimate beneficiary. Thus, it is very difficult to
take equity considerations adequately into account. However, the efficient
use of power can be greatly encouraged by an appropriate retail tariff
policy. At the moment a series of studies of long-run marginal cost pricing
is under way in a number of States in India. This should be followed by a
suitable program of tariff reform. Generally we expect that this would lead
to increases in retail tariffs which should in turn yield the dual results of
increased internal resource generation within the power sector and marginally
reduced rates of demand growth in the long-run. These should both help in
meeting demand for power efficiently over the next decade.
