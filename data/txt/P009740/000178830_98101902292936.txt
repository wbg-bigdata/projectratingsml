INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOR THE
KORBA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to India in an amount equivalent to US$200 million on
standard IDA terms, to help finance a project for the construction of the
first phase of a proposed 2,100 MW thermal power station. The proceeds of
the credit would be relent by the Government to the National Thermal Power
Corporation Limited for 20 years, including five years' grace, at an
interest rate of 10-1/4% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 11
2.        An economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects of India"
(1529-IN dated April 25, 1977), was distributed to the Executive Directors
on May 3, 1977. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
Background
3.        India is exceptional among the Bank Group's member countries for
its size and diversity; the country is divided into more than 20 States with
a population of some 630 million speaking over 60 languages. Since Independ-
ence the trend in growth of GNP has been about 3.5% per annum, or a little
over 1% per annum in per capita terms, while over the five years 1971/72 -
1975/76 it fell to as low as 2.5% per annum, in spite of the record harvest
of 1975/76. This unsatisfactory performance is only in part the result of
the low availability of investable resources: while India's domestic savings
effort compares well with other countries at the same average income levels,
however, the net transfer of resources from abroad has never been above 3% of
GNP, and fell to as little as 0.8% between 1969/70 and 1973/74. More signi-
ficant perhaps is the fact that in spite of a marked rise in the investment
rate from about 10% in the early 1950s to about 18% over the past fifteen
years, the trend in GNP growth has remained about the same. This indicates
a marked decline in the efficiency of capital use, as a result of increasing
capacity underutilization, long project gestation, and increased emphasis on
relatively capital intensive projects and sectors.
4.        Since Independence the growth of the socio-economic infrastructure
(transport, education, health services, etc.) has been impressive, but has
often been achieved at high cost and has yielded results of variable quality.
1/   Parts I and II of this report are substantially the same as Parts I
and II of the President's Report for the Karnataka Irrigation Project
Report No. P-2223-IN), dated March 15, 1978.



Many industrial and agricultural investment schemes have been highly success-
ful, but others have taken excessively long to be completed and have operated
well below full capacity. In some regions of the country, growth and struc-
tural change have been rapid and compare favorably with developments in many
other parts of the world; in other regions there has been stagnation, and in
some, decline. Although national income has increased in most years, there
has been no rise in the living stanclards of the vast mass of rural and urban
poor, conservatively estimated at 200 million people with per capita incomes
of US$70 per annum.
5.        The structure of the economy has been slow to change.  Agriculture
remains the dominant sector, wiith its share of national product declining
only gradually from about 50% to 42% over the last twenty years. The share
of manufacturing industry has increased only slowly and, since the late 1960s,
has remained approximately constant at about 16%. There has, however, been
a shift in the composition of manufacturing production, with consumer, inter-
mediate, and capital goods now contributing about one third each, compared
with an overwhelming preponderance of consumer goods 25 years ago.
Recent Trends
6.        In March, 1977, a part:y other than Congress formed a Government
for the first time since Independence.  The Janata, or People's Party, is
a heterogeneous amalgamation of smaller parties which had never before been
able to form a united front.  TLe state of the economy was not a prominent
election issue; in fact the economy was generally stronger than at any time
in the last ten years. Over the two years 1975/76 and 1976/77, the growth
of GDP averaged 5.4% per annum. Agricultural production in 1976/77 did fall
by about 3% but only because of a return to a more normal harvest of 111
million tons after the record 121 million ton output in 1975/76. In fact,
the 1976/77 figure is the second largest harvest on record. The growth of
industrial production accelerated over the past two years from 6.1% in
1975/76 to 9.2% in 1976/77. The volume growth of exports continued its
impressive recent performance, and averaged approximately 13% per annum
over the past two years. This export growth, together with hardly any in-
crease in import levels, has resulted in dramatic balance of trade improve-
ments with an estimated deficit for 1976/77 of less than US$500 million.
In sum, the overall resource position with record foreign exchange and food-
grain reserves, is exceptionally strong, and gives the Government considerable
room for maneuver.
7.        In agriculture the bumper crop of 1975/76 was largely due to remark-
ably good rainfall, both in amount and distribution, while the good crop in
1976/77 was produced under somewhat less than normal weather conditions. A
conspicuous change was the increase in fertilizer use, which rose by about
25% over 1975/76, following marked declines in fertilizer prices. Industrial
production benefited from fewer labor disputes, fuller utilization of in-
stalled capacity in both private and public sectors, a more liberal import
policy, relatively good power availability, and increased demand because of



- 3 -
higher consumer incomes, expanded exports and higher public expenditures.
Inflation re-emerged in 1976/77 as an important issue of economic management.
During 1975/76 the wholesale price index had fallen by 8.5%; but in 1976/77
it rose by 11.6%. The key characteristic of this rise was that it occurred
largely in a few agricultural commodities for which prices had dramatically
fallen in the previous year. In the twelve months ending September 1977, the
increase was less than 5%. The overall price index has shown virtually no
trend over the past three years taken together.
8.        The balance of payments situation has improved dramatically since
the 1973-1975 period. In 1975/76 the trade deficit was $1,530 million, which
was more than covered by US$1,560 million in net aid, US$205 million in net
purchases of currency from the IMF, and US$559 million in net miscellaneous
capital and invisibles (mostly private remittances); indeed, this large
aggregate net resource inflow led to a US$794 million increase in foreign
exchange reserves, to a level of almost US$2.2 billion. In 1976/77, the
balance of payments continued to improve, with exports provisionally, esti-
mated to have increased by US$1,145 million against an imports increase of
only US$85 million, so that the trade balance deficit is now estimated at only
US$470 million. The sharply decreased trade deficit, along with a further
increase in the net inflow of miscellaneous capital and invisibles from abroad
of US$640 million, more than offset the fall of US$350 million in net aid and
the US$365 million repurchases of currency from the IMF, and allowed a US$1.5
billion addition to reserves, which reached a level of US$3.7 billion at the
end of March 1977. The developments have continued in the current year, with
reserves estimated at US$4.8 billion as of October 1977.
Development Prospects
9.        The favorable economic situation gives the Government the opportun-
ity to address the longer-term constraints on growth. The basic task is to
raise the overall rate of growth from its historic range of 3% to 4%. In the
long run this will require raising more resources for investment. But it
will also be important to achieve significantly better utilization of avail-
able resources, partly through an immediate boost to industrial demand.
10.       In agriculture, the basic problem remains that, despite the record
foodgrain crop in 1975/76 and the good crop in 1976/77, the long-term growth
rate of foodgrain production has been unacceptably low, less than 3% per annum
over the last twenty-five years, and less than 2% since 1967/68. This has
meant that only in good years has there been any margin of production to cater
to per capita growth in food consumption, and in normal years it has been
necessary to import food. There is considerable scope for stepping up growth
both by increasing the use of inputs and by raising the productivity of exist-
ing capacity. Three promising developments in regard to the first are the
sharply higher outlays on irrigation in the Fifth Plan period along with a
renewed determination to increase public investment in irrigation even more
beginning in 1978/79 and to complete on-going projects expeditiously, the
indications that private investment in tubewells is picking up again after a
slowdown in the early 1970s, and the continued recovery of fertilizer demand.
With regard to more productive use of existing capacity, there is increased



awareness in the Government that: the benefits of irrigation projects can be
much increased not only through command area development but also through
more efficient design and operation of major surface irrigation infrastructure.
Also, hopes have been generated for increasing productivity on both irrigated
and rainfed farms through a reorganized and improved extension and research
system, which has been recently introduced in several States in northern and
eastern India.
11.       A strong effort to raise agricultural growth is essential, not only
to meet food requirements, but also because of the pervasive influence of
agriculture on the levels of activity in other sectors of the economy. This
effort must also be so structured as to increase the incomes of small and
marginal farmers, in order to increase production since they operate 25% of
the cultivated land and account for somewhat more than 25% of production,
and for welfare reasons, since they make up about 70% of rural population
and constitute the majority of those living below the poverty level.
12.       The industrial sector is poised for growth, as serious constraints
on the supply side have been removed by the improved situation, particularly
with respect to coal and imported raw materials and components; however, the
power supply situation is once more somewhat worrisome (paragraph 13 below).
There has been a progressive liberalization of controls and the 1976/77
Central Budget announced a reduction of some taxes on private industry. In
many cases management of public enterprises has improved, as is reflected
in their markedlv higher production and profitability as a group. In the
medium term it is the demand for industrial output that will determine indus-
trial growth. In certain industries, export demand will provide a strong
pull on production; this is true, for example, for certain chemicals, some
electrical equipment, processed agricultural products, vehicles and automobile
ancillaries. But the impact of increased exports on overall industrial demand
will grow only slowly given the current low share of exports in sales. If
the higher growth and productivity in agriculture discussed earlier were to
materialize, it would provide a significant stimulus to industry. It is
difficult to specify the linkages explicitly; but because of the large share
that agriculture holds in GNP, the coefficients do not have to be large for
agricultural growth and the concomitant growth in demand for industrially
produced inputs and mass consumption goods to boost overall industrial demand
significantly. A higher public deficit and increased public investments are
the instruments most directly under Government control, and also those that
can increase demand for industrial products most immediately. While the
first budget of the new government projects a relatively small deficit, it
does maintain a 20-22% increase in spending over the likely outlay in 1976/77.
The projected deficit is contingent on the utilization of foreign exchange
reserves; to the extent they are not utilized though increased imports, the
deficit will increase.
13.       The general improvement in the supply of energy augurs well for
India's ability to meet the needs of a more rapidly growing economy. Organ-
izational and transportation problems in the coal industry have largely been
overcome, production is generally sufficient to meet demand, stocks are



comfortable, and the industry has good prospects for meeting domestic demand
although exports have been cut back as a result of a disruption in the supply
of explosives early in the year. However, the supply of electricity continues
to be a concern, since the power situation is not uniformly good. Power
shortages affect a number of the more industrialized States, particularly
Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana and West Bengal; as a result, there is a con-
tinued constraint on the expansion of industry. This is despite a number of
favorable factors: greatly improved capacity utilization in thermal power
stations, more efficient exchange of power between States, accelerated imple-
mentation of power projects, and somewhat improved availability,of finance
for power investment. The inderlying reason for the weak power supply posi-
tion is that capacity shortages continue despite the improved investment
program. The prospects for the oil and gas sector have been further improved
by new finds of oil and gas near the large offshore Bombay High field. Crude
oil from Bombay High was brought to shore for the first time in May 1976;
production reached an annual rate of 2 million tons by March 1977, and will
rise to a level of 12-13 million tons by 1984/85. Although India will con-
tinue to import crude at or somewhat above the current level, much of the
foreign exchange burden of rapidly rising imports will be avoided by the
development of these resources. Prospects are also bright for further dis-
coveries off-shore, given the current high level of exploration activity.
14.       Underlying all other development issues is that of population.
Although India's population growth rate of a little over 2% is not high in
comparison with most LDCs, the size of the absolute increment - 13 million
annually - is daunting. It appears, however, that population growth may
have passed its peak in the 1960s, and it is expected to continue to slow
down, both because the birth rate will continue to decline and because the
death rate will not fall as steeply as in the past. It is apparent that
India's family planning efforts suffered a setback following the end of the
recent emergency period, and acceptor rates are at very low levels currently.
However, the new Government has announced its commitment to a voluntary family
planning program and has maintained ambitious performance targets. Although
it will take some time, adoption of family planning practices is expected to
increase to higher levels. Over the longer term, with a sustained family
planning effort, it should be possible to lower the population growth rate
to 1.1% per annum by the end of the century. Our "best guess" projection of
India's population by the year 2000 is 890 million. Many of the benefits of
family planning policy will only be felt beyond the turn of the century, but
the decline in fertility will bring about an early change in the age struc-
ture of the population.  The school age group will grow more slowly or not
at all after 1981, thereby reducing the pressures on the primary and second-
ary education system. The labor force, however, will continue to grow at a
fast rate until the end of the century.
15.       India's balance of payments position should be comfortable for the
next few years. The combination of past global inflation and increased ex-
ports have reduced the proportion of export earnings needed for debt service
from 30% in 1970/71 to 16% in 1976/77. The ratio is not likely to rise above
this level in the next few years. Given continuing favorable policies, the
volume of exports should grow by at least 7% to 10% annually in the near



- 6 -
future; and import needs for fertilizer, POL and foodgrains will continue to
require a diminishing proportion of available foreign exchange. The large
inflow of private remittances shows no immediate signs of declining and should
continue to bolster the foreign exchange position in the medium-term. Imports,
including a variety of capital goods, have already been liberalized signifi-
cantly. Increased public investment and a revival of the domestic economy is
likely to generate substantial additional import demand. However, this should
be quite manageable, given the currently comfortable foreign exchange position,
continued export efforts, and maiintenance of the current real level of net aid.
The present situation presents an opportunity to raise the level of investment
and, consequently, reach a more satisfactory level of long-term growth.
PART II - BANK GROU'P OPERATIONS IN INDIA
16.       Since 1949, the Bank Group has made 53 loans and 97 development
credits to India totalling US$2,0)15 million and US$4,934 million (both net
of cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts, US$886 million has been
repaid, and US$2,014 million was still undisbursed as of February 28, 1978.
Annex II contains a summary statement of disbursements as of February 28,
1978, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
17.       Since 1957, IFC has macle 14 commitments in India totalling US$58.4
million, of which US$13.8 million has been renaid, US$7.6 million sold and
US$6.9 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$30.1 million, US$23.6 mil-
lion represents loans and US$6.5 million equity. A summary statement of IFC
operations as of February 28, 1978, is also included in Annex II (page 2).
18.       In recent years, the emphasis of Bank Group lending has been on
agriculture. The Bank Group has been particularly active in supporting minor
irrigation and other on-farm investments through agricultural credit opera-
tions. Major irrigation, marketing, seed development, and dairying are other
agricultural activities supported by the Bank Group. Also, the Bank Group
has been active in financing the expansion of output in the fertilizer sector
and, through its sizeable assistance to development finance institutions, in
a wide range of geographically scattered medium- and small-scale industrial
enterprises. IDA financing of irndustrial raw materials and components for
selected priority sectors has been instrumental in facilitating better capac-
ity utilization in industry. The Bank Group has also been active in support-
ing infrastructure development for power, telecommunications, and railways.
Family planning, education, water supply development, and urban investments
have also received Bank Group support in recent years.
19.       The direction of assistance under the Bank/IDA program has been
consistent with India's needs and the Government's priorities. The emphasis
of the program on agriculture, industry, power, urban development and water
supply remains highly relevant. Projects designed to foster agricultural
production through the provision of essential inputs such as credit for
on-farm investments, command area development of existing irrigation schemes,
intensification and streamlining of extension systems, and seed production



- 7 -
form an important aspect of the Bank Group's program for the next several
years. Special emphasis will be given to projects benefitting small farmers.
Projects supporting water supply, sewerage, and urban development also form
an integral part of the Bank's lending strategy to India for the next several
years. Lending in support of infrastructure and industrial investments will
focus on agriculture-, export- and energy-related projects.
20.       The need for a substantial net transfer of external resources in
support of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of Bank economic re-
ports and of the discussions within the India Consortium. Thanks in large
part to the response of the aid community, India has successfully adjusted
to the changed world price situation. However, the basic need for readily
usable foreign exchange assistance, to augment domestic resources, assure
effective utilization of existing capacity, stimulate investment and accel-
erate economic growth, remains. As in the past, Bank Group assistance for
projects in India should include, as appropriate, the financing of local
expenditures. India imports relatively few capital goods because of the
capacity of the domestic capital goods industry. The import component of
projects tends to be especially low in such high-priority areas as agricul-
ture, education, and family planning. For the Bank Group to be able to make
an appropriate contribution to the financing of projects in these sectors, it
is important to cover a proportion of local expenditures.
21.       It is clear from the review of the Indian economy that as much as
possible of India's external capital requirements should be provided on con-
cessionary terms. Accordingly, the bulk of the Bank Group assistance to
India has been, and should continue to be, provided from IDA. However, the
amount of IDA funds that can reasonably be allocated to India remains small
in relation to India's needs for external support, and some Bank lending
to India, for which the country is creditworthy, is appropriate. As of
January 31, 1978, outstanding loans to India totaled US$1,168 million,
of which US$662 million remained to be disbursed, leaving a net amount out-
standing of US$506 million.
22.       Of the external assistance received by India, the proportion con-
tributed by the Bank Group has grown significantly. In 1969/70, the Bank
Group accounted for 34% of total commitments, 13% of gross disbursements,
and 12% of net disbursements as compared with an estimated 58%, 24% and 29%,
respectively, in 1975/76. On March 31, 1976, India's outstanding and dis-
bursed external public debt was US$13.1 billion, of which the Bank Group's
share was 25%. The Bank Group's share is expected to remain around this
level in the future. Because Bank Group assistance to India is predominantly
in the form of IDA credits, debt service to the Bank Group will rise slowly.
In 1976/77, about 14% of India's total debt service payments were to the Bank
Group.



-8-
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Developments in the Power Sector
23.       The Indian power sector is within the concurrent jurisdiction of
the Central Government and the State Governments. The Electricity (Supply)
Act, 1948 assigns extensive responsibilities to the State authorities, but
it also provides for the broad guidance and coordination of the Central Gov-
ernment. The principal agencies in the industry are the State Electricity
Boards (SEBs), which are responsible for the generation. transmission and
distribution of electricity within each State; the Central Electricity
Authority (CEA); and the two CentraL Power Corporations, the National Thermal
Power Corporation (NTPC) and the National Hydro Power Corporation (NHPC).
24.       Tn the 1950s and 1960s, power generation and the expansion of
installed capacity kept pace with consumption, growing on average by about
12% annually. Since 1970, the situation has deteriorated and power shortages
have grown in frequency and duration as demand for power has outstripped sup-
ply. Between 1970/71 and 1974/75 growth in power generation averaged only
6% annually. The followed two years of more rapid growth at an annual rate
of 13%. In the first five years of the decade, the main reason for
this poor performance was delays in completing new power projects, which led
to shortfalls in capacity below planned levels. Moreover, poor monsoons and
an unrealiable coal supply meant: that even available hydro and thermal capa-
city was not fully utilized. Weakness in the management of thermal power
stations also contributed to the problem. When in 1975/76 and 1976/77 the
situation improved, this was the product not only of two good monsoons and
of much improved coal supply but: also of a concerted effort in the power
sector to improve project implementation, thermal capacity utilization and
overall system management.  Capacity, grew by 10% in 1975/76 and by 8.3% in
1976/77. However, even these encouraging increases did not eliminate short-
ages of power which persisted in 1976/77 and the first half of 1977/78. This
reflects a very low rate of capacity expansion rather than inefficiency in
the operation of the system. Generating capacity throughout India, excluding
2,000 MW of non-utility capacity, currently stands at about 25,000 MW.
25.       While per capita demand for electricity has been rising in India,
it remains among the lowest in the world at about 140 kWh per annum.  Overall
demand is dominated by industry, which accounts for about two-thirds of all
electricity sold.  Agriculture and irrigation account for another 12 to 13%
of demand.  Growth of consumption has been particularly rapid in the rural
areas, where more than 80% of the total population live.  The number of
electrified villages grew from just over 3,000 in 1950/51 to some 200,000,
or about one-third of all villages in India, by 1975/76. The number of irri-
gation pumpsets and tubewells which have been energized increased from 21,000
in 1950/51 to 2.4 million by the end of 1973/74. An additional 1.2 million
are expected to be energized by the end of 1978/79 and a further 2.1 million
by the end of 1983/84.
26.       Since the Korba thermal power station is to be installed in the
Western Region, its power will be alLocated to the SEBs in that region --



i.e., Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Goa. These SEB systems are
interconnected at 220 kV although the "tie-in" with Madhya Pradesh is at
present weak. However, the Korba-Bhilai-Koradi transmission system included
in the Project will provide a 400 kV interconnection between Madhya Pradesh
and Maharashtra. The average annual growth rate of power sold in Gujarat
since 1970 has been in the neighborhood of 10% and in Madhya Pradesh about
15%. In Maharashtra, there have been power cuts on a sustained basis since
1972 amounting to some 30%, the brunt of which have fallen on industrial
consumers. The result is that, following a growth rate of around 10% per
annum in 1970 and 1971, load growth in Maharashtra fell to an average annual
rate of around 5% during the next five years. Industry accounts for about
60% of the sales of power in the Western Region; agriculture and-irrigation
about 15%. Demand for power for the whole Western Region in 1977/78 is
projected to be about 4,900 MW, or about one quarter of national demand. By
1983/84, in the absence of supply constraints, the forecast power-requirement
will grow to 9,100 MW. The Tenth Annual Power Survey for India forecasts
an acute power deficiency, in the range of 15% to 20%, in both Maharashtra
and Madhya Prades'i through 1983/84, and a smaller deficiency of 5% to 10% in
Gujarat over the same period.
27.       To help cope with the power scarcity and to strengthen Central
planning and coordination of the power system, the Government of India has
recently undertaken to construct and operate large Centrally owned generating
stations. For this purpose, the National Thermal Power Corporation and the
National Hydro Power Corporation were established in November 1975, with
authority to design, construct, own and operate generating and transmission
facilities and supply power in bulk directly to State Electricity Boards.
Planning and Coordination in the Power Sector
28.       State Electricity Boards.  Planning of power in India has, in the
past, been on a Statewise basis. Given the organization of the sector, SEBs
have been concerned only with developments within their own State boundaries,
and, until recently, little attempt has been made to evaluate the least-cost
method of meeting demand on a broader regional or national level. Histori-
cally, the financial management of the SEBs has been poor; in particular,
financial returns have been adversely affected by inadequate tariff policies.
However, there has been some progress in recent years. Under the power
transmission credits, SEBs were expected to work toward a rate of return
target of 9-1/2% on the capital base. The financial rate of return of Gujarat,
Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh SEBs in 1976/77 was 9.5%, 9.7% and 13.1%
respectively. By 1977/78, it is expected that ten SEBs, out of a total
of 18, will have achieved this target, and a further five SEBs should do so
in 1978/79. As a first step toward more comprehensive tariff reforms, an
analysis of the tariff structure of Andhra Pradesh State was carried out in
1976 following recommendations of Bank staff. Nine other SEBs have recently
completed pricing studies based on marginal cost pricing principles as a
result of undertakings given under previous Credits. 1/ Madhya Pradesh SEB
1/   Maharashtra, West Bengal, Gujarat, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan,
Punjab, Haryana and Delhi Electricity Supply Undertaking (DESU).



- 10 -
has agreed to carry out a similar study in connection with the proposed Korba
Credit. Thus, all the beneficiary States of the proposed project will soon
have at their disposal basic data and analyses needed for improved tariff set-
ting. Furthermore, amendments to the financial provisions of the Electricity
(Supply) Act, 1948 have been introduced in the Parliament and are expected to
be enacted during the current session. The Act, as amended, would require,
among other things, that tariffs be set to ensure that revenues will at least
meet operating expenses, depreciation and interest and a reasonable surplus
for capital investment.
29.       Central Electricity Authority.  Power planning nation-wide is to
be coordinated by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA). The CEA was set
up in 1950 to be responsible for devieloping a national policy for power
development and for coordinating the activities of the various planning
agencies involved in electricity supply. However, without any staff of its
own and with no clear and accepted functions to perform, it could not operate
effectively. In October 1974, responsibility for the power sector was placed
in a newly constituted Ministry of Energy, which was also placed in charge
of the coal mining industry. Following the establishment of the Ministry of
Energy, the functions of the erstwhiLe Central Water and Power Commission were
divided, with its power functions transferred to the CEA, reporting to the
Ministry of Energy. An order dated August 12, 1975, promulgated by the
President of India, details the new organizational structure of the CEA and
the responsibilities of its Chairman and Members. The Electricity (Supply)
Act, 1948 was amended, with effect from October 8, 1976, to assign to the CEA
new functions, including, in particular, the formulation of short-term and
perspective plans for power development, training of personnel, interconnected
system operations, and research and development; these are in addition to its
general responsibility for developing a sound, adequate and uniform power
policy and coordinating the activities of the planning agencies in relation
to the control and utilization of national power resources.
30.       With the rapid growth of thie power sector -- about 11% annual rate of
growth in demand -- and with the resultant increasing complexity of operation,
the need for coordination at the national level has increased. In recognition
of this, the Government has decided to pursue an integrated national approach
to sector development. The unified operation of power systems on a regional
basis has already commenced; the Southern Regional Grid went into integrated
operation in August 1972 and progressive integration of power systems in other
regions is intended to pave the *way for an all-India grid. IDA Credit 604-IN
(Fourth Power Transmission project) includes provision to help finance the cost
of consultants to study the technical, economic and financial aspects of the
long-term national plan for power development in India. GOI has established
a committee to agree on the standard design parameters to be adopted in devel-
oping the national grid which wiLl comprise initially a 400 kV network. Tesh-
mont Consultants, Inc. of Canada has been engaged by CEA to assist in the
detailed studies for developing the system. The work on the 400 kV systems
studies, which are basic to the ultimate establishment of a national power
system, is progressing satisfactorily. CEA is also working with Teshmont
Consultants on the development oif a 15-20 year plan which would include,
inter alia, detailed demand forecasts, investigations of power generation



- 11 -
schemes to meet load growth requirements, determination of resource require-
ments and definition of responsibilities and operational policies at the
State, regional and national levels.
Bank Group Operations in the Power Sector
31.       The Bank has made seven loans to India for power projects amounting
to US$179.5 million and IDA has made nine credits totalling US$596 million.
All the loans and credits for generating plant (excluding the Singrauli
thermal power project (Credit 685-IN)), the Beas project (Credit 89-IN) and
the first two transmission projects (Credit No. 242-IN and Loan 416-IN) have
been completed. The Singrauli project is still at an early implementation
stage and no disbursements have yet been made; in the case of the Rural
Electrification project (Credit 572-IN), disbursements to February 28, 1978
were US$10.3 million. Of the finance made available for the remaining trans-
mission projects (Credit 377-IN of May 1973 and Credit 604-IN of January
1976), US$80.6 million has been disbursed by January 31, 1978 in the case of
Credit 377-IN and in the case of Credit 604-IN, approximately US$44 million
had been committed by January 31, 1978 in respect of contracts awarded or
under issue. The ongoing power transmission projects and the rural electri-
fication project are proceeding satisfactorily notwithstanding delays in
initial implementation and in preparation of specifications for the more
sophisticated load despatch equipment. The Singrauli thermal power project
is also proceeding satisfactorily.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       The project was appraised by a mission which visited India in July/
August 1977. A report entitled "Appraisal of the Korba Thermal Power Project"
(No. 1733b-IN, dated March 10, 1978) is being distributed separately to the
Executive Directors. Negotiations were held in Washington in February 1978.
The Government of India was represented by Mr. R. Swaminathan of the Depart-
ment of Economic Affairs and Mrs. 0. Bordia of the Department of Power and
Mr. S.S. Murthy of the Central Electricity Authority. The National Thermal
Power Corporation was represented by Mr. D.V. Kapur, Chairman and Managing
Director. A Supplementary Project Data Sheet is attached as Annex III.
Project Description
33.       The proposed project consists of construction of the first 600 MW
of capacity in the Korba thermal power station, together with ancillary equip-
ment and related works and 400 kV transmission facilities to convey bulk power
to recipient SEBs -- i.e., Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. The power
station will be constructed near the coal field at Korba in the State of Madhya
Pradesh. Its generation capacity is expected to reach 2,100 MW -- comprising
three 200 MW and three 500 MW generating units -- by October 1986. The first
200 MW unit is expected to be commissioned by October 1, 1982, and the com-
missioning of the remaining two 200 MW units will follow at six-month intervals.
The principal components of the project include civil works; three 200 MW



- 12 -
turbo-generating units and three 680 tonnes-per-hour boilers, complete with
all auxiliaries, and ancillary electrical and mechanical equipment; coal
transportation and handling equipment; a 400 kV transmission system consist-
ing of about 880 circuit km of single circuit line, together with associated
equipment; and a simulator for "training operators.
Project Cost and Financing
34.        The total Korba 2,100 MW power development, including associated
transmission, is estimated to cost about US$1.3 billion. The project cost,
including contingencies. is estimated at USS405.9 million equivalent, of which
about US$53.4 million represents the estimated foreign exchange costs. In-
terest during construction adds about US$33 million to the financing required.
The proposed credit would provide 49% of the project cost, and 46% of the
total financing requirement. The balance of the financing would be made
available by the Government in the f'orm of loans and equity contribution.
Procurement and Disbursement
35.        All equipment financed und,er the proposed credit would be procured
through international competitive bidding. The proceeds of the credit would
be disbursed against the cost ofE consultants' services, electrical and mecha-
nical equipment, coal transportationL and handling equipment, transmission and
associated equipment, and the training simulator. US$10.0 million would be
unallocated. Indian manufacturers competing under international competitive
bidding would be granted a preference margin of 15% or the current rate of
import duty, whichever is less.
Project Implementation
36.        The National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC), which would
own and operate the Korba station, was established in 1975 under the Companies
Act, 1956, with an initial authorized share capital of Rs 1,250 million (US$145
million). It is managed by a Board, which presently consists of seven Direc-
tors, of whom two are full time. Steady progress has been made in building up
this institution since early 1976, when a competent and experienced Chairman
and Managing Director was appointed. The Mechanical, Electrical Design, Civil
Design, Systems Engineering and Operation Services Departments have been
established and NTPC is making good progress in the appointment of key staff.
As a relatively new organization entrusted with an important task, NTPC places
special importance on the need lor training of engineers and operators. It is
developing systematic programs for training the operating staff and plans to
establish a training school equipped with a simulator and other modern train-
ing facilities.
37.        Designs and specifications for the turbo-generators, boilers and
auxiliary plant and for the transmission towers, which are basically identical
with those for the Singrauli the!rmal power project are being prepared. NTPC
will carry out basic engineering and preliminary design. Consultants have
been appointed to assist in the design, preparation of specifications, and
supervision of construction of the various aspects of the project. As in the



- 13 -
case of Singrauli, the Thermal Design Organization (TDO) of CEA will function
as the principal review consultant for the power station. A retainer consult-
ant with experience in the design of large thermal power stations of 2,000 MW
and over will assist in the more sophisticated areas and will review specifi-
cations for the generating units, boilers and transformer packages and other
specifications as required by NTPC and the Association.
38.       An acceptable master plan for project implementation has been pre-
pared by NTPC. Soil conditions at the power plant site have been investigated
and the availability of adequate coal reserves in the Kusmunda block has been
confirmed. The Government has agreed to take all necessary steps to ensure
that adequate coal supplies will be available by the time the first generating
unit is commissioned (Section 3.04 of the Development Credit Agreement). For
transportation of coal from the mine to the power station, a merry-go-round
railway system would be used. The existing Darri Reservoir in the Hasdeo River
would meet the requirement of cooling water for the Korba thermal development
up to 1,000 MW. Construction of a new Bango Dam is planned about 20 km
up-stream of the Darri Barrage, and this project would provide sufficient
water for the planned capacity of Korba and for the other existing and planned
thermal stations and industrial projects using water from the Hasdeo River.
Construction of the Bango Dam project is expected to be completed within six
years, which would match the requirements of the Korba thermal power develop-
ment.  The Government has obtained an assurance from the Madhya Pradesh State
Government that water for the Korba thermal power station will be given first
priority over all other commitments for suDply of water from the Hasdeo River
and the Darri Reservoir.
39.       Adequate measures would be taken to minimize the adverse ecological
effects of the project, including stack emissions, heat dissipation and ash
disposal. The approval of the National Committee on Environmental Planning
and Coordination has been obtained, and appropriate occupational safety
standards would be observed (Section 2.10 of the Project Agreement).
NTPC Finances
40.       NTPC is expected to construct and put on stream four large-scale
thermal power stations with an aggregate generating capacity of 7,300 MW
(one 2,000 MW at Singrauli in Uttar Pradesh, two 2,100 MW stations at Korba
in Madhya Pradesh, and Godavari in Andhra Pradesh, and one 1,100 MW station at
Farakka in West Bengal). The Government's investment through 1987/88 in this
program and in the 6,040 circuit km of associated 400 kV transmission will be
about US$4,800 million equivalent.
41.       NTPC would not begin to earn revenues until the first 200 MW generat-
ing unit is commissioned at Singrauli, scheduled for December 1981. As the
generating capacity increases, NTPC's annual revenue is expected to increase
at a faster rate than its operating expenses and produce a rate of return on
the capital base rising gradually from 1.6% in 1982/83 to 9.5% by 1988/89.
By 1983/84, NTPC would have commissioned eight 200 MW generating units, in-
cluding those of the Korba Project (600 MW), the Singrauli project (600 MW),
together with additional two 200 MW units, and associated 400 kV transmission.



- 14 -
The overall investment cost for the years 1977/78 through 1983/84 is estimated
to amount to a little over US$4,000 million equivalent. The Government would
provide funds so that NTPC's debt/equity ratio would not exceed 1:1, in
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, and NTPC would inform
the Association of any proposal to modify existing limitations on the borrow-
ing powers (Section 3.03 of the Project Agreement). Loans would be repayable
by NTPC in 20 years, including periods of grace of up to five years, with
interest at a rate of 10-1/4% per annum.
42.       NTPC has agreed to achieve in 1988/89 and maintain thereafter a
rate of return of not less than 9-1/2% on the cost of the average net assets
in service, and to set tariffs from the time of commissioning of its first
200 MW generating unit at Singrauli, scheduled for December 1981, at levels
not lower than those estimated to be required to meet this target in 1988/89
(Section 4.03 of the Project Agreement). In view of the high capital invest-
ment in the early stages and the time involved in commissioning generating
units, this approach to setting the tariff and reaching the target rate of
return in 1988/89 would be appropriatoe. The forecast average bulk supply
price per kWh for the sale of energy is 22.1 paise (US$0.026), excluding
fuel surcharge. This rate has been adopted for the purposes of forecasting
revenues from 1981/82. NTPC's cash generation would not begin to cover
annual debt service and working capital increases fully until 1984/85. The
shortfalls of funds during the initial three years 1981/82-1983/84 would be
financed from equity capital provided by GOI.
43.       NTPC's capitalization as of March 31, 1982 when NTPC begins to earn
revenues would be US$2,332 million equivalent, divided between GOI loans
(including the relending of the Assoc:Lation's Credits) and equity in a ratio
of 49/51. By March 31, 1984, following completion of the project, NTPC's
capitalization would have increased to about US$4,020 million equivalent,
financed by GOI capital in a debt/equity ratio of 50/50.
44.       As in the case of the Singrauli thermal project, NTPC has agreed to
sell the project's output of power under bulk supply contracts satisfactory
to the Association (Section 2.09 of the Project Agreement), but since deter-
mination of the appropriate level of tariffs has to be consistent with the
financial viability of NTPC, the tariff would be adjusted, as necessary, to
meet the financial requirements. The Government has advised the Association
that Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat States and the Union Territory
of Goa indicated their willingness to purchase the power generated under the
project.
Project Justification and Risks
45.       In the recent past, the Western Region has been plagued with power
cuts of up to 30%, which have seriously hindered utilization of existing
industrial capacity and discouraged installation of new capacity. The power
cuts have also constrained agricultural output. Presently planned investment,
including the Korba power station, will lead generating capacity to expand by
about 7% per annum. However, the demand for power is currently projected to
grow at 10-11% per annum through 1984 and about 9% thereafter, so that power



- 15 -
shortages and restrictions are likely to continue. The proposed Korba develop-
ment offers economies of scale and of relatively low fuel costs due to its
location at the coal pithead. Of the other alternatives considered, the only
practicable one was the development of smaller thermal units at the load
centers. Korba was found to be preferable when compared with this alternative,
the equalizing discount rate being 29%. On the basis of the agreed power rate
targets (para 42), the internal rate of return, which equalizes the present
worth of revenues and the economic costs of the project, is satisfactory at
13%. Both these results are insensitive to changes in the main variables --
i.e., fuel and capital costs.
46.       The risks involved in technical aspects of project implementation
are no greater than can normally be expected with operations of this type.
However, the prospects for attainment of the project's institutional objectives
-- namely, the strengthening of power planning by the Central Government and
the development of a national power system -- must be viewed with some caution,
because the power sector is a "concurrent subject" under the Indian Constitu-
tion and is therefore influenced to a significant extent by sensitive Center/
State relations.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between India and the Asso-
ciation, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and NTPC, and
the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d)
of the IDA Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
48.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III.
49.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
50.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

Generally, the implementation of projects has been proceeling rea-
sonably well. Details on the execution of individual projects are below.
The level of disbursements was US$598.6 million in FY77 or 80% of Bank Group
commitments to India in that year. The undisbursed pipeline of US$2,014
million as of February 28, 1978, corresponds roughly to commitments over the
preceding two-year period and reflects the leadtime which would be expected
given the mix of fast and slow-disbursing projects in the India program.
Ln. No. 902    Tenth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$70.0 million loan of June 8, 1973; Effective
Date: August 16, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Ln. No. 1097   Eleventh Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of
India Project; US$100 million loan of April 2, 1975;
Effective Date: July 1, 1975; Closing Date: December 31,
1980
Ln. No. 1475   Twelfth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of
India Project; US$80 million loan of July 22, 1977
Effective Date: October 4, 1977; Closing Date: March 31, 1983
These loans have supported industrialization in India through a
well-established development finance company and are designed to finance
the foreign exchange cost of industrial projects. ICICI continues to be a
well-managed and efficient development bank financing medium and large scale
industries, which are often employing high technology and are export oriented.
Loans 1097-IN and 902-IN are fully committed and disbursements have reached
69% and 88% of total loan amounts respectively as of January 31, 1978, which
is slightly ahead of schedule.
Cr. No. 440    Bihar Agricultural Credit Project; US$32.0 million credit
of November 29, 1973; Effective Date: March 29, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Credit No. 440 provides US$32.0 million over three years in support
of a lending program for 50,000 units of tubewells and pumpsets in the Tirhut
Division of Bihar. Because of slow disbursements caused by a lower than esti-
mated Dollar/Rupee exchange rate and by low unit investment costs compared
with appraisal estimates, IDA agreed to extend the closing date by one year
to June 30, 1978, and to extend the project area to cover the whole State of
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Bihar. The physical targets should be achieved by revised closing date and
disbursements are expected to azcelerate.
Cr. No. 715    Second Agricultural Refinance and Development Corporation
(ARDC) Project; US$200.0 million credit of June 1, 1977;
Effective Date: August 24, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 197'3
The above agricultural credit projects are similar in structure,
being designed to provide long- and .uedi-.-terij. credit to farmers through
credit institutions, for on-farm investments, primarily in minor irrigation.
Credit 715 is a continuation nationwide of the previous program of agricul-
tural credit projects, which were confined to individual states. Apart from
initial start up problems with the individual state projects, mostly due to
the introduction of new lending criteria and lending terms, progress under
these projects has been satisfactory.
Cr. No. 267    Wheat Storage Project; US$5.0 million credit of August 23,
1971; Effective Date: November 14, 1972; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978
Cr. No. 747    Second Foodgrain Storage Project; US$107.0 million credit of
January 6, 1978; Effective Date: April 6, 1978 (expected);
Closin,g Date:  June 30, 1982
The US$16.0 million project (Credit 267), with co-financing arrange-
ments with Sweden, finances (i) the construction of bag and bulk grain storage
and handling facilities, (ii) staff training, and (iii) an All-India Grain
Storage Study. The government-owned Food Corporation of India is responsible
for the storage construction. All the nine 10,000 ton capacity bag warehouses
envisaged under the project as revised were completed and became operational
in 1975. The construction of five grain silos is progressing satisfactorily
and expected to be completed by September 30, 1978. The training component
is being implemented. The All-India Grain Storage Study was completed in
October 1976 and proved useful .in formulating the proposal for the Second
Grain Storage Project which was appraised in February/March 1977 and approved
by the Board on November 15, 19,77.
Cr. No. 456    Himachal Pradesh Apple Processing and Marketing Project;
US$13 million cretdit of January 22, 1974; Effective Date:
September 26, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
This project provides US$13.0 million to promote the development
of apple processing and marketing in Himachal Pradesh, and comprises grading
and packing centers, cold storage facilities, a juice processing plant, road
improvements and cableways. The project also includes on-farm cold storage
and oak mushroom production. The main executing agency is the Himachal
Pradesh Horticultural Produce Processing and Marketing Corporation (HPMC).



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 14
The project encountered initial delays due to managerial and technical prob-
lems; however remedial measures have been taken to overcome these difficul-
ties. Land is expected to be acquired for all packing and grading sites
by early 1978. The Project Preparation Report for the juice processing
plant has been completed and found satisfactory, and tenders on the equip-
ment are being called. The road improvement programme is progressing
satisfactorily, and the feasibility reports on aerial cableways at the
packing/grading sites are also expected to be completed shortly. As a
result of the significant improvement in project implementation during the
past year, disbursements have recently gathered momentum.
Cr. No. 403    Telecommunications V Project; US$80.0 million credit of
June 25, 1973; Effective Date: July 30, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
Ln. No. 1313   Telecommunications VI Project; US$80.0 million loan
of July 22, 1976; Effective Date: September 14, 1976;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980
Both projects are progressing satisfactorily. The closing date of
Credit 403 was extended by one year to December 31, 1978, to cover the
delivery and installation of imported transmission and switching equipment.
Disbursements under Loan 1313 have commenced.
Cr. No. 377    Power Transmission III Project; US$85.0 million credit
of May 9,, 1973; Effective Date: October 31, 1973; Closing
Date: September 30, 1978
Cr. No. 604    Power Transmission IV Project; US$150.0 million credit of
January 22, 1976; Effective Date: October 22, 1976; Closing
Date: June 30, 1981
For Power Transmission III all equipment has been ordered;
for Power Transmission IV, bids for all equipment have been invited and
most orders have been placed.
Cr. No. 481    Trombay IV Fertilizer Expansion Project; US$50.0 million
credit of June 19, 1974; Effective Date: August 21, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Cr. No. 520    Sindri Fertilizer Project; US$91 million credit of December 18,
1974; Effective Date: February 27, 1975; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978
Ln. No. 1079   IFFCO Fertilizer Project; US$109 million loan of January 24,

Cr. No. 598    Fertilizer Industry Project; US$105.0 million credit
of December 31, 1975; Effective Date: March 1, 1976;
Closing Date: June 31), 1980
Progress on the Trombay IV project has been good although project
completion may be delayed by about 18 months due to longer than expected
delivery times for critical equipment and to reflect the current situation
with respect to the use of the Credit proceeds. Under the Sindri project
plant construction and erection is proceeding generally according to schedule
except for a one-month delay due Lo uLLicipated delays in LeceipL of some
materials. Commencement of commercial production is expected by March 1978.
The anticipated cost to complete the project is presently running within bud-
get. The IFFCO project was delayed by about a year as a result of a change
in feedstock from fuel oil to naphtha and delays in completion of engineering
contracts. The project is now progressing satisfactorily based on naphtha as
feedstock. Site work has begun, process- and time-critical equipment is being
ordered, and engineering work is well under way. Credit 598-IN is designed
to increase the utilization of existing fertilizer production capacity. The
project has encountered delays in sulb-project preparation and investment
approvals by the Government. Further, some of the sub-projects identified
earlier may not materialize because of reconsideration by the Central and
State governments. The Central Government has submitted a list of sub-
projects to replace the ones that are likely to be dropped. Because of the
above, the project is likely to be delayed by 6-12 montths.
Cr. No. 294    Bihar Agricultural Markets Project; US$14.0 million credit
of March 29, 1972; Effective Date: July 31, 1972; Closing
Date: December 31, 11978
Cr. No. 378    Karnataka Wholesale Agricultural Markets Project; US$8.0 mil-
lion credit of May 9, 1973; Effective Date: September 7, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
These projects were designed to help with establishment of wholesale
markets in a number of towns in Bihar and Karnataka. Progress under the Bihar
project has generally been satisfactory. The project includes training of the
Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) staff and evaluation of the
project's economic impact.  Development plans have been com.p!eted for all of
the 50 project markets, but commencement of implementation is being delayed
for some of the markets pending land acquisition. Appraisals and loan sanc-
tions had been completed for 13 and were in progress for 18 markets. Farmers
and traders served by the 8 market yards now in operation report more effi-
cient marketing activities and improved farmers' terms of trade. Progress
under the Karnataka project is improving. As of August 1977, when the project
was last reviewed appraisals for 36 of the 39 project market yard plans had
been completed by participating banks and 25 of these 36 approved by ARDC.
Construction is in progress at 33 markets. In an attempt to accelerate project
progress, more liberal lending terms have been provided to APMCs and Market
Intermediaries (MIs) for construction of shop-cum-godowns. The project is
expected to be completed by the closing date (December 1979) and to achieve
its major objectives of making farm produce marketing more efficient and
improving farmers' terms of trade.

Cr. No. 312    Population Project; US$21.2 million credit of June 14, 1972;
Effective Date: May 9, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This credit is designed to finance an experimental and research
oriented population project in Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. The project's
infrastructure, which would provide the optimum facilities (buildings, equip-
ment, staff and transport) according to GOI standards in selected districts
in each state, is almost complete. The two Population Centers, which will
design and monitor research aimed at improving the family planning program,
are now functioning. To allow adequate time for the Population Centers to
complete their evaluation of family planning strategies and the introduction
of management information and evaluation systems, the closing date has been
extended to June 30, 1979.
Cr. No. 342    Agricultural Universities Project; US$12.0 million credit of
November 10, 1972; Effective Date: June 8, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
The project involves the development of the agricultural uni-
versities in Assam and Bihar. Initial lag in implementation on account
of late appointment of project staff has been overcome. Campus plans
have been approved, and construction has started in both Assam and Bihar.
Disbursements which have been slow because of initial delays should
accelerate now that construction and equipment procurement are under way.
Cr. No. 356    Industrial Development Bank of India Project; US$25.0 million
credit of February 9, 1973; Effective Date: June 22, 1973;
Closing Date: September 30, 1978
Loan No. 1260 Second Industrial Development Bank of India Project;
US$40.0 million loan of June 10, 1976; Effective Date:
August 10, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
Loan No. 1551 IDBI Joint/Public Sector Project; US$25.0 million loan of
March 1, 978; Effective Date: May 31, 1978 (expected);
Closing Date: March 31, 1983
The first IDBI Project (Cr. 356) had a slow start mainly due to
institutional problems in the participating State Financial Corporations.
However, the credit is now fully committed. In order to continue Bank
Group's involvement in assisting small and medium scale industries and in
strengthening the State Financial Corporations involved, the second operation
(Ln. 1260) was approved on May 18, 1976, and more than 25% of the loan amount
had been committed by mid-March 1978.
Cr. No. 390    Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$55.0 million
credit of January 22, 1974; Effective Date: March 13, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Having overcome earlier difficulties, including cost overruns caused
by inflation (requiring project redefinition in February 1975), redesign of



ANNEX II
Page 8 of 14
major project components and an unforeseen addition of a supplementary study
on sewage disposal, the project is now progressing relatively well. All of
the major contracts for the water supply components have been awarded and
it is forecast that works will be sufficiently advanced to permit the supply
of additional water in the last quarter of 1978; completion of water treatment
works for the whole supply by the end of 1979 is realistically forecast.
Completion of additional sewage disposal studies (August 1977) has allowed
engineering design of the project Sewerage components to proceed, so that
completion of construction of these works is now scheduled for 1980 two years
later than originally forecasted. Financial performance of the project entity
is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 585    Uttar Pradesh Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$40.0
million credit of September 25, 1975; Effective Date:
February 6, 19716; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project had a slow st:art due to delays in preparation of techni-
cal reports for regional and local water authorities. The technical reports
for about a half of the project have now been finalized and construction
works started in October 1976, about one year behind schedule. All consul-
tants for engineering, organization, management and accounting services for
the Jal Nigam (Water Supply Development Corporation) and the Jal Sansthans
(water authorities) have been engaged. Significant institutional develop-
ment can be expected only after thne consultants submit their final recommenda-
tions. The project is expected to be completed by March 1980, approximately
9 months behind schedule.
Cr. No. 616    Eleventh Industrial Imports Project; US$200.0 million credit
of February 26, 1976; Effective Date: April 1, 1976; Closing
Date:  June 30, 1978I
Utilization of the Technical Development Fund has been slower than
anticipated and the closing date has been postponed by one year to allow
completion of disbursements from the Fund which has been fully committed.
Cr. No. 427    Calcutta Urban Development Project; US$35.0 million credit
of September 12, 1973; Effective Date: January 10, 1974;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1979
Cr. No. 756    Second Calcutta Urban Development Project; US$87.0 million
credit of January 6, 1978; Effective Date: April 10, 1978
(expected); Closing Date: March 31, 1983
For the first of these project, following considerable increases in
project costs, GOI and IDA finalized a project redefinition in April 1976, to
accommodate the project to funcling available. It is now expected to be
substantially completed by March 1979. Agreements have been reached on
consultants services and technical assistance, as provided for under the
project.

of April 1, 1977; Effective Date: June 30, 1977; Closing
Date: September 30, 1981
The project is designed to develop and promote low-cost solutions
to the problems of providing improved services to the urban poor in the
Madras Metropolitan Area (MMA) and to strengthen metropolitan planning.
Project components consisting of sites and services; slum improvement; small-
scale and cottage industry; and maternal and child health are designed to
benefit directly some 250,000 persons in low-income areas of the city.  The
water supply and sewerage; road and traffic improvements; bus transport and
technical assistance components are designed to eliminate bottlenecks in
water supply and transport.
Cr. No. 482    Karnataka Dairy Development Project; US$30 million credit of
June 19, 1974; Effective Date: December 23, 1974; Closing
Da.e: September 30, 1982
Cr. No. 521    Rajasthan Dairy Development Project;; US$27.7 million credit
of December 18, 1974; Effective Date: August 8, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
Cr. No. 522    Madhya Pradesh Dairy Development Project; US$16.4 million
credit of December 18, 1974; Effective Date: July 23, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
These three credits totalling US$74.1 million support dairy devel-
opment projects organized along the lines of the successful AMUL dairy coop-
erative scheme in Gujarat State. The Karnataka Project which got off to a
slow start has begun to show considerable improvement under new management
appointed recently. Farmer response has been good and over 500 dairy coop-
eratives with small farmer participation are functioning effectively. All
four dairy unions, as envisaged under the project, have been established and
are functioning satisfactorily. In Madhya Pradesh good progress has been
made. About 110 new dairy cooperatives societies have been established.
Detailed design studies for plant construction are complete. The response
of small farmers to the project is excellent. GOMP has plans to cover all
districts in the State. Technical services investments are being made.
Contracts have been placed for livestock imports. The Rajasthan project is
also doing well. Four milk unions have been formed and excellent progress
has been made in organizing the servicing of nearly 350 dairy cooperatives
at the village level. Plant-designs are ready, and procurement is making
adequate progress. Karnataka's decision to procure plant equipment jointly
with Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh on the same tender should lead to a recovery
of considerable time lost earlier in the Karnataka project.
Cr. No. 532    Godavari Barrage Project; US$45 million credit of March 7,
1975; Effective Date: June 9, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980

1977; Effective Date: January 16, 1978; Closing Date:
October 31, 1983
These projects, based on existing large irrigation systems, are
designed to improve the efficiency of water utilization and, where possible,
to use water savings for bringing additional areas under irrigation.  Canal
lining and other irrigation inf-rastructure, drainage, and land shaping are
prominent components of these projects. In addition, provisions have been
made to increase agricultural production and marketing by reforming and
upgrading agricultural extension setrvices and by providing processing and
storage facilities and village access roads. Progress of these projects
is generally satisfactory and particularly successful with respect to
agricultural extension.
Cr. No. 541    West Bengal Agricultural Development Project; US$34 million
credit of April 28, 1975; Effective Date: August 28, 1975;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980
The project provides US$34.0 million over four years mainly for
minor irrigation investments but also for development of markets, agro serv-
ice centers, and support of related government services. Although disburse-
ments have been slower than anticipated there has been a considerable improve-
ment in project organization and administration during the past six months
and disbursements are expected to improve considerably during the next twelve

months. The physical progress of shallow tubewells, and of deep tubewells
for the Minor Irrigation Corporation is satisfactory. IDA, GOWB and ARDC
are combining efforts in order to solve difficulties such as organizational
problems at the farm level; lack of demand for agro service centers; and
finalization of designs for water distribution systems and irrigation
schemes. Positive results, particularly for the water distribution systems
are expected shortly.
Cr. No. 682    Orissa Agricultural Development Project; US$20 million

Cr. No. 737    Rajasthan Agricultural Extension and Research Project;
US$13.0 million credit of November 14, 1977; Effective
Date: February 16, 1978 (expected); Closing Date:
June 30, 1983
Cr. No. 761    Bihar Agricultural Extension and Research Project; US$8.0
million credit of January 6, 1978; Effective Date: April 6,
1978 (expected); Closing Date:  October 31, 1983
These projects totalling US$63 million finance the re-organization
and strengthening of agricultural extension and the development of adaptive
agricultural research services with the objective of achieving early and
sustained improvements in agricultural production, particularly foodgrains.
Arrangement for monitoring and evaluation of project progress and impact is
an essential feature of these projects. The Orissa and Assam projects also
provide funds for laying the basis for longer term improvements in ground-
water development in the States. The project's components include provision
of additional staff, training facilities, housing, offices, laboratory
facilities, equipment and transportation.
Cr. No. 526    Drought Prone Areas Project; US$35.0 million credit of
January 24, 1975; Effective Date: June 9, 1975; Closing
Date: June 30, 1980
Overall physical progress of the Drought Prone Areas project (DPAP)
continues to be satisfactory. The rate of disbursement is improving and
implementation of most components is proceeding, by and large, according to



ANNEX II
Page 12 of 14
schedule. However, progress may be affected by possible changes in thinking
at the national level. GOI is presently reviewing all national rural develop-
ment programs, including the DPIA, in order to determine ways to improve over-
all performance in the rural sector. The Government's review is being fol-
lowed closely to determine whether any recommendations would have an impact
on the ongoing project and require changes.
Cr. No. 680    Kerala Agricultural Development Project; US$30 million
credit of April 1, 1977; Effective Date: June 29, 1977;
Closing Date: MaLrch 31, 1985
This project would improve tree crop production in Kerala and has
particular emphasis on increasing benefits to small farmers. It comprises
rehabilitation of 30,000 ha coconut and 10,000 ha pepper and 2,240 ha cashew,
and new plantings of 5,000 ha coconut and 1,500 ha cashew. About 25% of the
coconut area would be irrigated for intensive intercropping. Funds have been
provided for development of a seed garden for tree crops and for strengthening
tree crops research. Ten crumb rubber factories would also be established to
process smallholder rubber. Project implementation started slowly due to
initial staffing and funding delays but has recently gained momentum. Pro-
ject actions for 1978/79 have been r,aphased and advance action planned so
as to make up for lost time.
Cr  No. 572    Rural Electrification Project; US$57.0 million credit of
July 23, 1975; Effective Date: October 23, 1975; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
Eleven states have now fulfilled the conditions of eligibility for
on-lending under this project [compared with six at the time of appraisal].
The project got off to a slow start, due principally to the need to adapt
specifications and tender documents to international competitive bidding
procedures, but these problems have been overcome. As of April 1977, orders
had been placed for 60 approved rura]L electrification schemes, and tenders
had been invited or were in the course of preparation for others.
Cr. No. 582    Railways XIII Project; US$110.0 million credit of August 26,
1975; Effective Date: October 10, 1975; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978
The project was designed to cover most of the foreign exchange
requirements of Indian Railway's (IR) investment program for two years, from
April 1, 1975, through March 31, 1977. However, since the approval of the
project, increased production in steel products in India and further develop-
ments in IR's indigenization program slowed down the rate at which IR requires
foreign exchange. Therefore, the Closing Date was extended for one year to
September 30, 1978 in order to complete implementation of the project.

Cr. No. 609    Madhya Pradesh Forestry Technical Assistance Project;
US$4.0 million credit of February 26, 1976; Effective
Date: May 26, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
This project will identify a sound resource base for pulp and paper
manufacture and related industries, develop suitable logging systems, and
undertake a feasibility study to determine optimal use of the existing wood
resources in the Bastar District of southern Madhya Pradesh. It also includes
a study of ways to integrate the area's tribal population with future develop-
ment.  After initial delays due to diifficulties in employing key personnel,
project implementation is now satisfactory. The contract for the feasibility
study has been awarded.
Cr. No. 610    Integrated Cotton Development Project; US$18.0 million
credit of February 26, 1976; Effective Date: November 30,
1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
This project finances equipment and civil works and crop production
credit to support programs for cotton research and increased cotton produc-
tion in three states. The project also provides credit for improving cotton
ginneries, new ginneries, cotton seed oil extraction plants and vegetable oil
processing factories. Project management and coordination were established
and the cotton production program has been pursued energetically. Implementa-
tion of the research and industril comnponents has started.
Ln. No. 1273   National Seed Project; US$25.0 million loan of June 10, 1976;
Effective Date: October 8, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
This project supports seed industry expansion in the public and
private sectors; improvements in seed quality control; strengthening of
breeding and seed technology research; and development of a reserve stock
scheme. Institutional development and managerial arrangements, particularly
at the state level, have proceeded fairly satisfactorily. Project imple-
mentation, however, slowed down after loan effectiveness mainly due to
organizational problems. Project progress is now being made since approval
of the project by the new Government in September 1977 and is anticipated
to gain further momentum as GOI is about to appoint the two top officers
of the National Seeds Corporation.

December 20, 1976; Effective Date: March 10, 1977;
Closing Date: September 30, 1980
Disbursements have been delayed somewhat because of delays in pro-
curement action. However, contracts for bodies and chassis for 325 single
deck and 175 double deck buses have been awarded and some 144 buses have
been delivered. Bids for an additional 200 buses are being evaluated. Civil
works contracts have been awarded for 8 to 15 bus facilities, and 13 of about
traffic engineering schemes. Delays are expected in implementing some BMC
traffic engineering schemes and the BEST workshop schemes although steps are

being taken to minimize such delays. Consultants in organization, adminis-
tration, financial management systems, accounting and development planning
are at work assisting the Borrower, the Bombay Metropolitan Regional Devel-
opment Authority. The beneficiaries of the loan, the Bombay Municipal Corp-
oration and the Bombay Electric Supply and Transport Undertaking, have selec-
ted consultants in traffic engineering and operations and management assist-
ance, respectively.
