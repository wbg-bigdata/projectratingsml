April 1977 to May 1978
In April 1977, the Government instituted a dual exchange rate system.
Under this system, a new "special" exchange rate of US$1.000 - J$1.250 was
established for all transactions except essential imports and transactions of
the Government and bauxite sector, which remained at the old ("basic") exchange
rate of US$1.000 = J$0.909. Subsequent adjustments were made in the "basic"
and "special" rates and by May 1978, the rates were:
Basic                           Special
US$1.000  =  J$1.050            US$1.000  =  J$1.350
J$1.000  = US$0.952            J$1.000   -  US$0.740
May 1978 to March 1979
On May 10, 1978, the exchange rate was unified at the new rate of
US$1.000 = J$1.550. The Government started a system of monthly devaluations
which would total 15% by May, 1979. The following were the exchange values
in effect on April 27, 1979.

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:         Government of Jamaica.
Beneficiary:      Ministry of Works.
Amount:            US$16 million.
Terms:             Payable in 17 years, including four years of grace
at 7.9% interest.
Prolect
Description:       The project's main objective is to support the Ministry of
Work's (MOW) Five-Year Road Maintenance Program which is
intended to prevent further deterioration of the 3,000 mile
road network under MOW responsibility. It aims to do this
through improving the standards of road and equipment
maintenance operations and management. The project includes
the following principal components: asphaltic concrete
overlay of about 76 miles of primary and main secondary
roads; asphaltic resealing of about 253 miles of arterial,
secondary aLnd tertiary roads; equipment replacement and
overhaul; and about 150 man-months of technical assistance
to aid the MOW in the implementation of its maintenance
program and the Ministry of Public Utilities and Transportation
(MPUT) in a study of the viability of the railway system.
Major project benefits include vehicle operating cost savings
through improved road conditions and reduction in annual
maintenance costs. There are about 200 miles of resealing
of tertiary roads that are principally farm-to-market roads,
within the 253 miles of asphaltic resealing included in the
project. !Small farmers who use these roads will benefit
from the reduced cost of transporting agricultural produce
to market and bringing in supplies. It is estimated that
the direct incremental employment generation of the project
would entail about 1,600 jobs, of which about 1,400 would be
unskilled labor. Principal project risks involve inadequate
financial support for the maintenance program, shortages of
equipment and loss of technical personnel. The project
design is intended to reduce them to tolerable levels.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO JAMAICA FOR A
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Jamaica for the equivalent of US$16.0 million to help finance a
fourth highway project which would be a part of the Government's five year
road maintenance and improvement program. The loan would have a term of 17
years, including four years of grace, with interest at 7.9% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
Introductiont
2.        Ai Economic Memorarndum was prepared and distributed to the Executive
Directors in May 1978. An Economic Report entitled "Current Economic Position
and Prospects of Jamaica" was distributed to the Executive Directors in
May 1979.
Background cLo the Economic Crisis
3.        Jamaica's real GDP per capita has declined in every year since 1972,
the cumulative decline being about 20% through 1978. This downward spiral
appears particularly striking when one notes that the country is well endowed
with natural resources, has well educated and skilled manpower, enjoys the
advantage of proximity to the lucrative North American market and possesses a
developed financial system. To some extent, however, its advantages are also
its disadvantages.  The openness of the economy makes it highly susceptible
to exogenous factors such as international price and demand changes. Its
labor and capital have proved internationally mobile, with every domestic
economic crisis being accompanied by a massive outflow of capital and an
exodus of labor. Finally, its proximity to the United States and Canada has
resulted in some emulation of the consumption patterns and levels of its more
affluent northern neighbors.
4.         The Government which came to power in 1972 inherited an economy
which had experienced rapid growth but which suffered from some serious struc-
tural defects. These included (i) a policy bias against the agricultural
sector, the traditional source of Jamaica's employment opportunities; (ii) an
industrial sector which had grown under excessive protection and had become
inefficient., highly import-dependent and capital intensive; (iii) increased
pressure on urban centers due to migration from the rural areas; and (iv) a
widening of income inequality. The development strategy of the new Government
1/  This part is substantially the same as the corresponding section in the
President's Report (No. P-2540-JM, May 10, 1979) for the Second Program
Loan.

in terms of economic diversification, an expanded public sector role, employ-
ment promotion and redistribution of income created an atmosphere of uncer-
tainty with the immediate result of reduced investment activity by the private
sector. The situation was further aggravated by the increase in petroleum and
other commodity prices, the world recession of 1974-75, the drying up of
foreign commercial bank lending, labor problems in some of the key sectors and
political violence. In response to the ensuing balance of payments and fiscal
problems, there was a massive outflow of capital in 1976 (estimated at over
US$150 million or 5% of GDP). This has been accompanied by the migration of
skilled manpower, a phenomenon which initially was one of the main results of
the poor growth performance but now is one of its main causes. Table 1
illustrates some key aspects of this growth experience.
The Government's Response to the Crisis
5.        Since early 1977, the Government has been making concerted efforts
to alleviate the country's severe economic problems. The measures have
included a new tax effort, a wages policy for both the private and public
sectors, tightening of import restrictions and exchange rate adjustments.
In July 1977, the Government adopted a comprehensive program which became
the basis for an agreement with the IMF on a one-year standby arrangement.
Under this arrangement, Jamaica drew the first tranche of US$22 million, but
by early 1978, it became apparent that the Government would not be able to
meet the targets of the standby arrangement. Instead of seeking to renego-
tiate the arrangement, the IMF and Government negotiated a three-year
Extended Fund Facility arrangement in May 1978, which permitted a longer
period for economic adjustment and provided a higher level (US$240 million
for a three-year period through June 1981) of financial assistance from
the IMF. The main focus of the program is to channel the maximum amount
of resources toward investment and growth. To this end, domestic consumption
is expected to decline from the 1977 level of about 88% of GDP to about
83% of GDP by 1980. The key elements of the program for the first year of
the Facility arrangement were the following:
(i) Exchange rate policy: On May 10, 1978, the Government ended
the dual exchange rate system, in force for over a year, and
moved to a unified rate of US$1.00 = J$1.55. This implied an
effective weighted average devaluation of 25%. In addition,
the Government agreed to a program of small monthly devaluations,
which would total 15% by May 1979. Beyond that, it agreed
to frequent moves of the exchange rate in order to maintain the
competitiveness of Jamaican exports.
(ii) Incomes policy: Wage increases in any wage contract expiring
after May 1, 1978, have been limited to maximum nominal increases
of 15% per year for the two-year period. This limit applies to
the value of all concepts of pay: straight time pay and overtime
rates, plus the money value of all fringe benefits and allowances.
The wage guideline has been applied to the public as well as
private sector.
(iii) Fiscal policy: The overall deficit of the Central Government was
to be reduced to 12.5% of GDP in 1978/79 from about 16% of GDP in
1977/78 through expenditure cuts and a new tax package.

(iv) Production policies: The Government has reaffirmed its commit-
ment to a mixed economy. Public enterprises are expected to
operate on a cost recovery basis. Although price controls are
to be maintained for most basic necessities, they have either
been lifted or significantly liberalized for all other items.
6.        In addition to the foregoing, the program for the first year con-
tained (i) ceilings on net credit to the public sector from the banking
system; (ii) limits on the domestic assets of the Bank of Jamaica; (iii) limits
on the authorization of new foreign indebtedness by the public sector;
(iv) targets for increases in international reserves; and (v) provisions for
orderly management of payment arrears.
7.        Quarterly program tests have generally been met and through
April 30, 1979, five drawings, totalling about US$90 million, had been made
under the Extended Fund Facility. The exchange rate policy has been imple-
mented as planned, the rate being US$1.00 = J$1.766 on April 27, and one
further small move is expected to bring it to the originally agreed level.
Regarding the incomes policy, available data suggest that the 15% guideline
was substantially adhered to. Even when one includes the somewhat larger
wage increases negotiated prior to the effectiveness of the 15% guideline,
wages in the unionized sector increased, on the average, by less than 20%.
In respect to fiscal policy, however, the current account deficit was higher
(2.6% of GDP) than the progammed level (0.5% of GDP), although the overall
financing deficit was on target, owing to the slower implementation of projects.
8.        At the end of April, agreement was reached with the IMF on the
targets and policies for the second year of the program. The Government and
the IMF are agreed that the exchange rate and wage policies pursued over the
past year have restored Jamaica's export competitiveness, and, accordingly,
the mini-devaluations will be suspended as of May 1979. Emphasis will there-
after be placed on preserving Jamaica's competitiveness through (i) the reduc-
tion of the ceiling on wage increases from 15% of last year to 10% this year;
(ii) a more active monetary policy in which interest rates will be allowed
to increase.
9.        Over the last year, the Government has shown considerable resolve
in adopting the measures required to cope with the serious economic situation.
Politically, this has not been easy. Consumer prices increased by about 50%
during 1978 at a time when the Government was generally enforcing the guideline
regarding 15% nominal wage increases. The removal of subsidies on many items,
the adjustments in the tariffs of many services, and the additional burden of
the new tax package have combined to cause a considerable decline in the real
income of the population. Although public dissatisfaction with economic
conditions has generally been restrained, some civil disorders took place in
January 1979 in connection with a gasoline price increase and a one-day general
strike occurred thereafter in mid-February.
External Financing Requirements
10.       Since 1977, and concurrently with IMF negotiations, the Government
has continued discussions with bilateral and multilateral sources as well as
with foreign commercial banks for a package of extraordinary external financing.

The financing plan was based on a detailed analysis of the size of the external
resource gap, and the Bank has played an active role in the determination and
mobilization of the required resources not only through its first program loan,
but also through the Bank-sponsored Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic
Development. Commitments of US$53.6 million in the form of program-type
assistance were made to Jamaica in June 1978 under the Group, and by the end
of March 1979, about US$37 million had been drawn down. Details on the
sources and uses of the external financing are provided in Tables 2 and 3.
11.       The Bank Second Program Loan is an integral part of the financing
package (see Table 3). To ensure that the negative real growth of output of
the last several years is reversed, a minimum level of merchandise imports
(c.i.f.) of US$1,000 million would be required, compared to US$872 million in
1978. Owing to the foreign exchange constraints of the last few years, the
level of capital and intermediate goods imports of agriculture and industry
(excluding the bauxite/aluminaL sector) were reduced from US$585 million in
1975 to US$450 million in 1976 and US$305 million in 1977. In 1978, thanks to
the package of special external financing of which the Bank's First Program
Loan was a part, these imports increased to US$510 million, but even then the
1978 levels of such imports was about 30% below that of 1975 in real terms.
Although in absolute terms, the Bank Second Prbgram Loan represents a rela-
tively small part of Jamaica's import requirements for 1979, the loan would
account for a significant percentage of the/funds required for imports by
Jamaica's exporters of non-traditional manufactured goods.  The revolving fund
financed by the loan is expected to turn over up to 1.3 times a year so that
the foreign exchange availabi:Lity stimulated by the loan during its first year
of operation would be up to US$40 milliion. Given the present low capacity
utilization in the manufacturing sector, and given that in real terms the
foreign exchange availability to the sector is considerably lower than in
1975, the Second Program Loan is expected to play a crucial role in the
Government's strategy for export promotion.
Impact of Government's Policies on the Economic Situation
12.       The key macroeconomic indicators suggest that the balance of
payments and fiscal situations have generally improved during 1977 and 1978
compared to 1975 and 1976, reflecting both improved international demand for
Jamaica's exports and the effects of the policy measures which have been
introduced cver the last two years to deal with the crisis.
13.       Balance of Payments.  Buoyed by strong demand in the industrial
economies, the production of bauxite increased from 10.1 million long tons in
1976 to 11.3 million long tons in 1977 and to 11.8 million long tons in 1978.
In value terms, the exports of the bauxite/alumina sector increased by about
27% between 1976 and 1978. Sugar and banana exports increased marginally in
value terms due mainly to slightly better prices. Non-traditional exports and
tourism, on the other hand, have benefitted considerably from the exchange
rate adjustments.  While merchandise exports increased by 22% in current terms
between 1976 and 1978, merchandise imports were maintained at below their 1976
level through a rigorous system of import licensing. The result has been that,
despite the higher net factor service payments, the current account deficit
has been substantially lower during 1977 and 1978 than during 1975 and 1976
(see Table 4). This has enabled Jamaica not only to reduce its commercial

arrears subsitantially, but also to increase marginally its gross official
reserves over the 1976 level. While the balance of payments situation still
remains difficult, the major trade-related distortions have been substantially
reduced.
14.       Public Finances.  Helped by the exchange rate adjustments, the
Central Government budgetary accounts registered substantial improvements
during 1977/78 and 1978/79. iLn reflection of the improved aluminum market
and as a consequence of the new tax package, current revenue increased by
about 57% in nominal terms between 1976/77 and 1978/79. By contrast, current
expenditure over the same perLod increased by 47% due to careful monitoring
of the expenditures of the ministries and departments by the Ministry of
Finance. In addition, capital expenditure has been lower during the last
two fiscal years due to slow implementation of projects. As a result, the
overall financing deficit decreased from 18.4% of GDP in 1976/77 to about
16% in 1977/78 and to about 12% in 1978/79 (see Table 5). This is still an
excessively large deficit but is expected to decrease appreciably as the
Government continues its adherence to its stabilization program.
15.       Output and Employment.  The above accomplishments in the fiscal and
balance of payments areas have been at a considerable cost in terms of output,
employment, and prices. The lower level of imports has led to shortages of raw
materials and intermediate goods which have, in turn, led to the closure or
reduced activity of many distributing and manufacturing firms. There is a
large underutilization of capacity in the productive sectors, in part because
of external conditions and in part because of the restriction on imports and
domestic demand. On the basis of provisional data, real GDP stagnated in 1978,
following declines of 6.7% an,d 4.0%, respectively, during 1976 and 1977.
Unemploymeni: increased further to about 26% by the end of 1978, after remain-
ing stable at the high level of about 24% over the past two years. Finally,
as a direct consequence of the economic package, consumer prices (on an end-
of-period basis) increased by about 50%, implying a decline in real wages of
,over 30%.
Growth and Balance of Payments Prospects
16.       Output.  The level of economic activity in Jamaica continues to be
severely restricted by the country's limited import capacity and scarcity of
skilled manpower. The speed with which recovery can be accomplished conse-
quently will depend heavily upon the growth of export earnings, the ability
of the public sector to mobilize external financing on appropriate terms, the
trends in private capital inflows, and the capacity of the Government to
ameliorate the problems arising from shortages of skilled manpower. However,
given the prospects of a tight balance of payments during the first half of
1979, GDP is expected to grow in real terms by no more than 2.5% during the
year. Growth prospects beyond 1979 appear somewhat brighter as the economy
gradually overcomes the current short-term constraints. GDP growth rate, in
real terms, is projected at 3.5% for 1980 and 4% beyond 1980.
17.       Balance of Payments.  Assuming no recurrence of the civil unrest
that occurred in early January, and given normal local weather conditions for
agriculture, the exports of goods and nonfactor services of Jamaica should

increase during 1979 to a level of about US$1,115 million, a nominal in-
crease of 11% above the 1978 level of about US$1,006 million. Total bauxite
production is projected to increase to 12.6 million tons, about 7% above the
1978 level of 11.8 million tons. The production of sugar is projected to
increase to 350,000 tons, 16% above the 1978 level but still lower than the
1972 level of 373,000 tons and substantially lower than the 500,000 tons in
1965. Slight improvement is also expected in banana production and exports.
The area which is expected to benefit most from the Government's new emphasis
on export promotion is non-traditional exports. The proposed changes in the
incentive structure to favor exporting, together with more favorable macro-
economic policies, are expected to result in a nominal increase of about 25%
in the exports of non-traditional exports (mainly manufactured goods but also
including some agricultural goods and petroleum by-products). Provided that
there are no further disruptions, tourist arrivals should increase by 12-13%
during 1979.
18.       Imports of goods and nonfactor services are projected at US$1,152
million, about 14% above the 1978 level. On this basis, the current account
deficit in 1979 is projected at US$135 million (about 4.5% of GDP) compared
to US$142 million (5.3% of GDP) in 1978.
19.       Over the five-year period, 1979-83, the current account deficit is
projected to average about US$85 million annually. In addition to this
deficit, amortization payments on existing and new debt to be contracted are
expected to average US$146 million. Thus, the annual external capital require-
ments to cover both current deficits and requisite amortization payments are
estimated to average US$231 million.
20.       It is projected that gross disbursements of medium- and long-term
loans and credits would provide, on an average, about US$255 million. Com-
plemented by potential net disbursements from the IMF, averaging about US$65
million annually, this would be sufficient to cover the above indicated
capital requirements and also provide for strengthening of international
reserves 1/ and for a small outflow on account of direct private investment
due to amortization of bauxite/alumina investments.
21.       Creditworthiness.  Jamaica's public external debt has grown rapidly
in recent years. At the end of 1973, external public debt outstanding and
disbursed was US$309 million, or about 16% of GDP. By the end of 1978 it had
risen to about US$1,005 million,or about 38% of estimated GDP. Particularly
because of the shorter maturities of much of the recent borrowing, the growth
in debt service has been more rapid than the growth of debt. Service payments
on this public debt are estimated at about 17% of exports (including nonfactor
services) in 1978, compared to 6% in 1973. The interest payments in 1978 alone
amounted to about 2.4% of GDP and to about 8% of central government current
revenues.
22.       Debt and debt service, in relation to GDP and exports, are now above
the levels that are desirable for a small open economy that is not highly
diversified. The role of external borrowing will necessarily be limited by
the need to improve these relationships and thus give the Jamaican authorities
greater freedom of action in their economic management. The most desirable
1/   Net foreign reserves are expected to increase by US$67 million in 1979.

way of reducing the debt service ratio are to increase GDP and exports and to
borrow on more favorable terms rather than to reduce the net inflow of capital
from abroad. The projected debt burden is shown in Table 7. Interest as a
percent of GDP is projected to fall slowly from 2.4% in 1978 to 1.8% by 1985.
This slow improvement is reflective of the present debt structure of Jamaica,
with the service payments to foreign commercial banks expected to account for
70% of the total debt service payments in 1979. A gradual improvement in debt
structure is foreseen in line with the Government's limits, under the economic
programs, on the authorization of new foreign indebtedness of shorter
maturities by the public sector and this improvement is expected to offset
the increase in the average effective interest rate (as new loans at around
8.5% replace older loans contracted at lower nominal interest rates). The
debt service ratio and the ratio of debt outstanding and disbursed is pro-
jected to decline gradually over the next several years, due in large part to
good prospects for exports, especially of bauxite/alumina. On this basis,
provided Jamaica successfully carries out its economic stabilization program
and pursues its new export-oriented strategy, it should be able to manage its
external indebtedness and be considered creditworthy for continued external
assistance.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN JAMAICA
23.       The Bank has made 19 loans 1/ in Jamaica totalling $227.4 mil-
lion after cancellations. Of this amount, $101.5 million (45%) has been for
infrastructure investments in transportation, electric power, water supply and
sewerage; the remainder has gone into agriculture and agroindustry (19%); pro-
gram lending (13%), education (10%), sites and services (7%), population and
nutrition (4%), and small scale enterprises (3%). There have been two IFC
investments in Jamaica; a loan in 1961 to a pre-mix concrete company and an
equity/loan investment in 1968 in a hotel project. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of March 31, 1979 and notes on
the execution of projects in Jamaica.
24.       Bank lending in Jamaica has covered a wide range of sectors and
development problems. Initially, the Bank lending program emphasized infra-
structure investment. Although financing for this purpose has continued,
the emphasis of the lending program in the early and middle 1970s moved to
the social sectors, with projects in education, population and nutrition,
housing and employment for the urban poor and rural development. In response
to changing economic forces, a further shift in Bank lending has taken place
in Jamaica for the late 1970s. The priority needs of this most recent period
have been the country's critical short- to medium-term balance of payments and
production requirements. Thus, the FY78 lending program contained a $30 mil-
lion program loan and an $18 million loan for the rehabilitation of sugar
1/   Exclusive of the Forestry and Second Program Loans approved by the
Executive Directors on May 31, 1979.



- 15 -
factories. The FY79 forestry project and second program loan are directed
at similar needs. Although the Bank lending program has experienced shifts in
emphasis and priorities based on changing economic conditions, the longer-term
objectives of balanced economic development have not been overlooked. Accord-
ingly, while some of the loans now under consideration are directed at promo-
ting exports and the development of efficient import substitution activities,
other development objectives are being addressed to the extent possible. Bank
lending aims to support programs to increase employment, to achieve a wider
distribution of the benefits of economic growth, and to preserve and improve
essential infrastructure. It is also an important objective of Bank lending
to strengthen the public sector institutions associated with Bank-financed
projects by supporting polic:ies to improve the quality of their management,
operating procedures and finances.
25.       Coordination with other external lenders and assistance agencies
has been given particular attention in formulating the Bank's lending strategy.
The Bank has taken a lead role in an international aid effort for the Caribbean
called the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development. Its first
meeting was held in Washington in June 1978 and a second meeting is scheduled
for June 1979. The Group has brought together the donor agencies and countries
for the Caribbean and the recipient countries. Within the framework of the
Group, individual country subgroup meetings, similar to Bank consultative group
meetings, have been held. The subgroup meeting for Jamaica has provided an
opportunity to present a country project list and to coordinate assistance
efforts. As a result of the Caribbean Group and subgroup meetings, and of
related donor activities, Jamaica has received commitments, exclusive of Bank
and IMF assistance, for additional balance of payments and project local cost
financing oE $53.6 million in FY79 from several bilateral and multilateral
donors. Local cost financing provided in this manner financed the local cost
requirements of several Bank assisted projects in FY79. The Caribbean Group
also provided a basis for co-financing foreign exchange costs with tne OPEC
Special Fund in the Bank assisted Second Power Project. The Bank has also
worked closely with the UNDP in developing a small UNDP financed technical
assistance project to improve the execution of development projects, in which
the Bank would be the executing agency.  In addition to the close relationship
established with the IMF and the UNDP in dealing with Jamaican problems, the
Bank has worked intimately with other sponsoring agencies of the Caribbean
Group--the ]'nter-American Development Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank,
as well as with bilateral aid agencies in the United States, Canada and the
United Kingdom.
26.       Project implementation difficulties have been endemic to Bank and
other internationally financed projects. These difficulties have had three
principal causes: (i) shortage of key personnel; (ii) inadequacies in the
systems of management used in planning and controlling projects; and (iii)
organizational and structural problems in the public sector. The difficult
economic condition of the last several years have affected and intensified
the problem in all three areas. The Government, the Bank and the other inter-
national agencies are taking steps to deal with it in existing projects and
the design of new projects, but it is too early to assess the impact of these
steps.



- 16 -
27.       In July 1978 the Bank provided a $7 million loan for a Small Scale
Enterprise project which is assisting emerging enterpreneurs and small busi-
nessmen. The project is expected to have significant employment and social
benefits. A Forestry Project Loan and a Second Program Loan were approved by
the Executive Directors on May 31, 1979. In addition, an education project
which deals with vocational education and teacher training has been appraised
and is under preparation. Looking further ahead, projects have been identified
for assisting export industries and to support the Government's efforts in the
agricultural sector. It is expected that the precedent established for close
coordination with other external aid donors will continue and exert a strong
influence on the future character of Bank lending to Jamaica. The Bank's
share of external public debt outstanding and disbursed was about 8% in 1977
and its share of external public debt service was about 5% in that year. It
is estimated that in 1978 Bank share of external public debt outstanding
increased to about 11%, while its share of external public debt service
remained about the same.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
Background
28.       The basic transport infrastructure that Jamaica requires to meet
its economic development needs is in place. The country must now maintain
the level of serviceability and efficiency of the existing infrastructure
to meet the demands of the economy. The proposed project will focus on the
preservation of existing capital in the highway subsector.
The Transport System
(a) Ports and Shipping
29.       The twelve ports currently operating in Jamaica, handled 13.4 million
tons of cargo in 1977. Six specialized ports handled 9.5 million tons of
bauxite-alumina exports in 1977. There are four ports that principally handle
the export of bananas and sugar. The port of Kingston, which handles 85% of
the island's general cargo traffic is Jamaica's most important port. A
recently constructed container/transshipment terminal, nine break bulk wharves,
roll-on/roll-off facilities and cruise ship piers have transformed the port
into a modern, efficient and profitable operation. It has become a major
transshipment point for Europe-Orient trade through the Panama Canal. Although
Jamaica's ports will need specialized equipment from time to time, the present
infrastructure is adequate and offers sufficient capacity to serve the island's
export, import and transshipment traffic in the foreseeable future.
(b) Air Transport
30.       Air transport is served by two international airports as well as
by several small domestic airports and airstrips. The two international
airports are at Montego Bay, which serves the north coast and specializes
in tourist traffic, and at Kingston, which serves Jamaica's southern coast



- 17 -
and caters mainly to business and other non-tourist travel.  Air Jamaica,
Jamaica's gcovernment-owned international airline, provides service to North
America and Europe. Internal air traffic which is particularly important
to businessmen, is mainly served by the 75% government owned Trans-Jamaican
Airlines, Ltd. The rapid increase in air traffic in the first half of the
seventies exerted considerable pressure on the facilities available at
Kingston and. Montego Bay International Airports. A Bank loan is helping
finance civil works to improve the operational capacity of the two inter-
national airports, and technical assistance to improve management systems
and planning. Project implementation was hampered by financial and managerial
problems. Flowever, after a number of delays, the civil works are now substan-
tially completed. Once the improvements at the Kingston and Montego Bay
airports are completed, Jamaica's airport facilities will be adequate to meet
the country's needs for the foreseeable future.
(c) Railways
31.        TLe public railway system operated by the Jamaica Railway Corpora-
tion (JRC) consists of the 110-mile Kingston-Montego Bay line, the 62-mile
Spanish Town to Port Antonio line and about 35 miles of yard, station and
siding lines. Although the bauxite companies own and operate a number of
short mine and plant-to-port rail lines, they also provide 99% of the
Government-owned railway's freight traffic. The JRC's deficit has grown
dramatically in recent years from J$ 800,000 in 1973 to an estimated J$ 4.8
million in L978. The lines serving bauxite-related traffic are profitable
while those serving passenger and general merchandise traffic operate at a
loss. In view of the competition between road and rail transport for passenger
and general freight, and given the present tight limitations on Government
spending, the Government has agreed with the Bank that no investment in excess
of US$500,000 in rail transport, other than spending directly related to
improving services for bauxite-related traffic, will be undertaken pricr to an
agreed study (Section 4.03, Loan Agreement). This study will identif, the
*most economically viable rail system for Jamaica, taking into consideration
the implications for the country's public finances.  In order to avoid
possible duplication the exact scope and the terms of reference of this study
will be prepared after a review of studies currently underway concerning the
viability oE the JRC system.
(d) Highways
32.       Jamaica's road network is relatively extensive and totals about
8,100 miles. The main non-urban network, which is the responsibility of the
Ministry of Works, totals about 3,000 miles, of which two-thirds, or 2,000
miles, is paved. The remainder of the island's roads totals some 5,100
miles, of which 4,500 miles are maintained by Parish Councils and about
600 miles are urban-type roads administered by the Kingston and St. Andrews
Council (KSAC) in the metropolitan Kingston area. The main road system can
be characterized as a coasta:L ring with three main roads crossing the
mountains and connecting the northern and southern coasts directly. While
the present road system is basically complete, some parts of this network,
due to past neglect of maintenance, have reached a critical point in their
economic life. The Bank agrees with the government investment strategy of
restricting planned new investment in roads to preserving the existing system.



- 18 -
33.       Traffic on the island's main arterial roads grew at between 6% to
9% p.a. between 1968 and 1974, and then, because of increased fuel prices
and Jamaica's economic downturn, stagnated and declined after 1976. Traffic
growth in the next few years is expected to be minimal, reflecting the
country's gradual economic recovery.
34.       The road transport industry is not closely regulated by the govern-
ment. Present road traffic regulations are considered inadequate in that they
specify permissible gross loadings and not axle loadings. In addition, the
Government grants permits which authorize operators to overload, but the
permit price vastly undercharges the vehicle users in relation to the damage
caused to the roads. A recent Bank financed study has recommended setting
a maximum axle loading for all vehicles and increasing license fees for
overweight to recover the cost of damage caused by overweight vehicles. The
Government has proposed an acceptable axle-load control program, and has
agreed to changes in present regulations and a program for the purchase and
installation of weighbridges to be financed under Loan 1032-JM (Section
4.05, Loan Agreement).
35.       MOW is responsible for the construction and maintenance of arterial
and secondary roads. The Ministry of Local Government is responsible for roads
maintained by Parish Councils, while both the Ministry of Agriculture and MOW
construct, and MA maintains, agricultural feeder roads. Planning for the
greater Kingston area is performed by the Kingston and St. Andrews Council,
which reports to the Ministry of Public Utilities and Transport.  The
Directorate of Maintenance (DM) in MOW plans, executes, and administers road
maintenance, and the Directorate of Electrical and Mechanical Services (DEMS)
is responsible for purchasing, maintenance and repairing of ministry vehicles
and maintenance equipment. A shortage of technical staff is a serious problem
which faces MOW. Additional salary payments to such personnel through the use
of "scarcity allowances" authorized under the Jamaican civil service system
for hard to recruit and retain skills is expected to alleviate the problem.
Additional assistance may also be made available by donors in providing fund-
ing or personnel within the framework of the Caribbean Group for Cooperation
in Economic Development (see para 25).
36.       Road expenditures are financed from annual budget allocations
provided by the Central Government and from loans from international agencies.
Total expenditures on roads increased in real terms by 78% between 1973/74
and 1976/77, and then declined by 36% the following year, reflecting a
decrease in budget allocation caused by the tight public finance situation.
Road investment expenditures by MOW accounted for about 75% of all capital
expenditures on roads during the past five years. Of this, about 30% was
spent on periodic maintenance and minor improvements of roads. While these
expenditures have reduced the backlog of periodic maintenance, further
increases will be needed in the coming years in order to restore the road
network to acceptable levels of serviceability and to prevent further
deterioration. Revenues from road user charges, although not earmarked
for highway expenditures, are now sufficient to cover all road expenditures,
including new construction.



- 19 -
37.       Financial constraints due to cutbacks in Government allocations and
low equipmentL availability due to a severe shortage of spare parts and low
productivity of the equipment maintenance organization have restricted the
scope of road maintenance. However, the overall quality of the MOW's road
maintenance activities is good.
Transport Planning and Coordination
38.       One of the major problems in the transport sector is the lack of
overall sector planning and coordination of investment decisions. In the
early seventies the government: based its plans largely on the recommendations
of a national transport survey prepared by consultants during the 1968-70
period.  Because the government lacked the staff to analyze modal investment
and to update the survey, provision was made in Bank Loan 1032-JM for tech-
nical assistance to establish a permanent transport planning and coordination
unit. The objective of developing adequate capacity for transport planning
will be pursued under the project. The work program of the Transport Planning
Unit for the period 1980/81 was reviewed and agreed to during negotiations.
The Government will prepare and commence, by November 30, 1979, a plan,
satisfactory to the Bank, for adequate permanent staffing of the Unit by
June 30, 1980. This plan wilL include provision for at least two professionals
with satisfactory qualifications and experience in planning and related dis-
ciplines (Section 4.06, Loan Agreement).
Past Bank Assistance for Highways
39.       Over the last 15 years the Bank has assisted the development of
road transport in Jamaica through three projects. The First Highway Project
loan (Loan 408-JM) for US$5.5 million was made in April 1965. It helped
finance the detailed engineering and construction of main roads and was
satisfactorily completed in July 1973. A Project Performance Audit Report was
issued in August 1975 and highlighted the need for detailed engineering and
improved cost estimates before loan signing. This is now standard practice
for road projects. A loan for a Second Highway Project (Loan 899-JM) for
US$9.3 million was made in June 1973 for road maintenance and is almost
completed. It is the precursor of this proposed project. The Second Highway
Project fell, short of its initial objectives, owing to sharply increased
costs, which made it necessary to reduce by almost 50% the number of miles to
be resurface!d. The loan nevertheless succeeded in resurfacing 220 miles of
road and resealing an additional 240 miles of road, while making a substantial
contribution toward improving the quality of maintenance works in MOW and
toward preserving the road network. The Third Highway Project Loan (Loan
1032-JM) for $13.5 million was made in July 1974. It was to help finance the
constructionl of about 20 miles of new arterial roads which would relieve the
congestion on the most heavily trafficked sections of the network. Although
the works are still justified, increased costs and the country's difficult
economic situation, has made it necessary to reduce design standards.
After earlier delays in construction caused by difficulties with contractors
and labor, project implementation has improved and the project is scheduled
for completion by late 1980. The objectives of the second project concerning
vehicle weight control and transport planning would be pursued under the
proposed project. The project completion report is scheduled for preparation
by July 1979.



- 20 -
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project Development and Preparation
40.       A report entitled "Staff Appraisal Report - Fourth Highway Project -
Jamaica" (No. 2421-JM, June 6 , 1979) is being distributed separately. A Loan
and Project Summary is presented at the front of this report and a Supplementary
Project Data Sheet is given in Annex III. The project was prepared by MOW
with the help of consultants during 1978 and was appraised in November/December
1978. Negotiations were held in Washington from May 7 to May 14. The Govern-
ment was represented by a delegation led by Mr. Ainsley Elliott, Deputy
Financial Secretary in the Ministry of Finance and Planning.
41.       Under the Bank's Second Highway Loan, the technical assistance
consultant, prepared a Five-Year Road Maintenance Program in 1973. Later,
the Government and the Bank agreed that the program should be updated and
an economic justification prepared to serve as a basis for possible Bank,
or other external financing. The further study was carried out by the
consultant with financing by funds remaining in the Second Highway Loan,
and the report was issued in October 1978. The Government has adopted the
recommended Road Maintenance Program for the fiscal five-year period April
1979 to March 1984, a part of which comprises the proposed project.
Project Objectives and Description
42.       The objectives of the project are to continue the improvements in
road maintenance operations and management started under the Second Highway
Loan by financing a portion of the Bank-approved Five-Year Road Maintenance
Program. The project would further reduce the backlog of periodic road
maintenance, initiate a maintenance equipment overhaul and maintenance program
and, generally, improve the standards of road and equipment maintenance
management.
43.       The project consists of:
(i) Asphaltic concrete overlay of existing pavement on about 76 miles
of primary and main secondary roads representing road sections
having the highest economic priority for implementation in the
first two years of the Road Maintenance Program.
(ii) Asphaltic resealing with double surface treatment of some
253 miles of arterial, secondary and tertiary road selected
on the same basis as for the overlay work.
(iii) Asphaltic sealing of about six miles of gravel tertiary
road.
(iv) Preparatory work such as drainage improvements and surface

(v)  The procurement of albout 210 units of replacement road
maintenance equipment representing the first two years'
needs under the Road Maintenance Program.
(vi)  The procurement of spare parts needed for a program of
overhauling salvageable units of the present road maintenance
equipment fleet together with workshop tools and minor
workshop improvements.
(vii)  Technical assistance by consultants to aid MOW in the imple-
merLtation of the Road Maintenance Program; to help in
training of MOW field maintenance and mechanical staff; and
to assist MPUT with a study on the viability of the railway
system.
44.       An important aspect of the project would be technical assistance
to help MOW improve road and equipment maintenance planning and management.
Under the Second Highway Loan, a Road Maintenance Programming System (ROMGRAM)
and a Road Maintenance Works Costing System (RMCS) were introduced, but as a
result of specialized manpower not always being available, neither have been
utilized to the extent intended. The Government has agreed that, with the
help of the technical assistance provided by the loan, these systems would be
fully implemented to provide a proper basis for preparing annual road mainte-
nance budget estimates; to determine needs for labor, equipment and materials;
and provide reliable cost data for assessing past performances (Section 4.04,
Loan Agreement).
45.       A Hire Funding scheme was introduced in MOW under the Second Highway
Loan as a means of ensuring the availability of the funds needed for equipment
replacement and spare parts by charging fixed rental rates to users of the
fleet. Budgetary constraints and ineffective management prevented the scheme
from being used effectively. The Government has agreed that, under the
project, the Hire Funding scheme would be fully implemented; the funds gener-
ated would be retained in a special fund which would be separate from MOW
accounts; and foreign exchange would be made available to MOW as needed for
the purchase of replacement equipment and spare parts (Section 4.04, Loan
Agreement).
Implementation
46.       MOW would be responsible for project execution.  To ensure proper
management and control of the project, MOW has agreed to the full-time assign-
ment of at :Least four civil engineers (two are already assigned), one mechanical
engineer and two accountants who will serve as the key counterparts to the
technical assistance consultaLnts' staff (Section 3.02, Loan Agreement). Assign-
ment of such staff, except fcir one of the civil engineers and one of the
accountants who may be hired by December 3, 1979, is a condition of loan
effectiveness (Section 5.01, Loan Agreement).
47.       The implementation period for the project would be about three
and a half years (mid 1979 through 1982).  The preparatory and surfacing
work would extend over slightly more than a three-year period ending in
the summer of 1982; procurement of equipment, spare parts and workshop
tools would require about two years from late 1979 to final delivery in late
1981; and technical assistance would cover a three-year period ending in about
mid-1982.

Cost Estimates and Financing
48.        The total cost of the project (see Project Summary) is estimated
to be US$25.8 million equivalent, including contingency allowances. Physical
contingencies were estimated at between 10% and 15% of base costs, while price
contingencies were based on projections for domestic and international infla-
tion. The proposed loan would finance the foreign exchange costs of the
project estimated at US$16 million, equivalent to 62% of total project cost.
the Government would finance the local component of project costs (US$9.8
million) and the recurrent and other capital costs (US$45.2 million at 1979
prices) required to carry out the remainder of the agreed Five-Year Road
Maintenance Program. Thus, the proposed loan would finance about 23% of the
total cost of the Five-Year Road Maintenance Program.
49.        Cost estimates for the asphaltic overlay, sealing and resealing
are based on consultant estimates which were prepared using quantity estimates
from detailed road condition inventories and current contract rates in
Jamaica for this type of work. Estimates for preparatory work are also
based on consultant road condition inventories and on recent costs of
similar work by MOW force account. Estimates of parts and components for
the equipment overhaul program are based on condition inventories of the
present road maintenance equipment fleet and the costs of replacement
equipment and workshop tools are based on lists prepared by the consultant
and MOW together with manufacturers' quotations and recent purchases in
the region. The estimate for workshop improvements is based on preliminary
plans prepared in MOW. Technical assistance costs are estimated on the
basis of an average rate of about US$6,300 equivalent per man-month which is
in line with current costs of these services.
Procurement and Disbursement
50.       The procurement program for equipment, spare parts and workshop
tools, indicating lot sizes and estimated costs, would be subject to prior
approval by the Bank. Contracts for equipment (including about one year's
supply of spare parts), spare parts and tools with estimated cost of over
US$75,000 would be procured through international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement." Lots with estimated
costs of less than US$75,000 and within overall ceilings of US$500,000, would
be procured in accordance with current MOW procedures which are satisfactory.
51.        In order that MOW, assisted by the technical assistance consultants,
can provide adequate supervision and control, and to afford maximum opportunity
for bidding by qualified local contractors, the asphaltic overlay and reseal-
ing work would be awarded in eight packages, each consisting of several
relatively small contracts (all less than US$0.6 million) over a period of
about 18 months. Because of this schedule, the small contract sizes and the
scattered locations of the roads involved, the work is considered to be of no
interest to foreign paving contractors, none of whom are presently established
in Jamaica. Therefore, this work would be carried out by contract following



- 23 -
local competitive bidding by prequalified contractors with foreign firms
afforded the opportunity to participate. This is similar to the procedure
followed under the Second Highway Project which resulted in responsive and
competitive bidding. The minor workshop additions included in the project
would also be carried out by contract after local competitive bidding, or,
if bids are not responsive, by force account.
52.       Because the type and quantities of work involved cannot be esti-
mated to the required accuracy, the preparatory work for the surfacing is
considered unsuitable for execution by contract. Therefore, this work is
being carried out under force account by MOW. Quality and quantity monitor-
ing is provided by the technical assistance consultants.
53.       I)isbursements of the Loan would be made as follows:
(a)  56% of total expenditures for overlay, sealing, resealing,
preparatory works and workshop improvements;
(b)  [00% of foreign expenditures for direct imports of spare
parts, replacement: equipment and workshop tools; and
(c)  100% of foreign expenditures for technical assistance by
consultants.
Retroactive financing in an amount not to exceed $440,000 will be authorized
for technical assistance and project preparation works begun after April 17,
1979 (Schedule 1, Loan Agreement).
Economic Evaluation
54.       Quantifiable benefits from the proposed maintenance works include
lower vehicle operating costs, time savings of road users from higher average
speeds, and reduced annual maintenance costs on those roads which are overlaid
or resealed. Savings from reductions in accidents were not quantified, and
to the extent that improved surface conditions improve traffic safety, the
economic returns are conservative. The proposed maintenance project is
well justified with an estimated economic return of over 50%. The overlay
component of the project has a benefit cost ratio of about 11.0:1, and the
sealing and resealing benefit cost ratio is about 3.4:1. The benefit cost
ratios on the major civil work components, the overlay and resealing works and
associated preparatory works were respectively 11.0:1 and 3.4:1. While no
separate evaluation has been effected for the equipment component, the depre-
ciation costs of equipment were included in the consultants' economic evalua-
tion of the overall Five-Year Program, which had economic returns well in
excess of 50%. The investment in road maintenance and workshop equipment and
overhaul of existing equipment will result in a better maintained road network,
portions of which would be lost without effective maintenance. The entire
3,000 miles of road networ]k maintained by MOW would benefit to some degree
from the use of the equipment purchased under the project.
55.       While no exhaustive analysis of distribution of benefits has been
made, it is clear that producers and consumers of agricultural goods which are
transported on the road system will benefit from the project. Included in the



- 24 -
project is the resealing of about 200 miles of tertiary roads that are princi-
pally farm to market roads. Small farmers who use these roads will benefit by
the reduced cost of transporting agricultural produce to market and bringing
in supplies. A proportion of the transport cost savings from the project will
also be passed on to bus passengers on the project roads, who are principally
rural dwellers. It is estimated that the direct incremental employment gener-
ation of the project would entail about 1,600 jobs of which 1,400 would be
filled by unskilled laborers.
Project Risks
56.       Past deficiencies in the road maintenance program have been caused
mainly by lack of funds, shortages of equipment and loss of technical staff.
These remain the risks for the proposed project and efforts to minimize their
impact have been made in project preparation. Detailed estimates of both
local and foreign currency requirements for all elements have been prepared
and adequate funding is the object of specific commitments by the Government
(Section 3.01, Loan Agreement). The equipment overhaul and replacement
elements of the proposed project, coupled with technical assistance to aid in
making the Hire Funding scheme fully operational, will initiate a continuous
program for the proper maintenance and timely replacement of equipment and is
expected to result in proper levels of availability. There is also full
agreement on the need to retain qualified technical assistance consultants
and on the assignment of qualified counterpart staff to key posts. Therefore,
the project risks have been minimized and are of an acceptable level.
PART VIII - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
57.       The draft Loan Agreement between Jamaica and the Bank and the
report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement are being distributed separately. Special conditions
of the loan are listed in Annex III, Section III. A special condition of
effectiveness is the assignment of Ministry of Works personnel to counter-
part positions.
PART IX - RECOMMENDATION
58.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   Projec   in Execution
Ln. No. 727   Second Education Project; US$13.5 million of March 25, 1971;
Effective Date: July 30, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Project implementation is about three years behind appraisal
schedule due to a change in government, high turnover in project unit staff
and a lack ofE project implementation machinery. However, project implemen-
tation now seems satisfactory.
Ln. No. 899   Road Improvement: and Maintenance Project; US$9.3 million of
June 1. 1973; Effective Date: August 31, 1973;
Closing Date: Jmne 30, 1979.
Increased costs have made it necessary to reduce by almost
50% the number of miles which were to be resurfaced. The loan has succeeded
in resurfacing 220 miles of road and resealing an additional 240 miles of
road, while making a substantial contribution toward improving the quality of
maintenance work and preserving the road network.
Ln. No. 1003 Sites and Services Project; US$15.0 million of June 13, 1974;
Effective Date: September 9, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Delays in the project have been caused by initial start-up
problems, political violence and ineffective management controls. The project
is about 18 months behind schedule and costs are running 50% more than anti-
cipated. The Government has adopted measures suggested by the Bank to improve
management systems and controls.

Ln. No. 1004 Second Agricultural Credit ProJect; US$5.5 million of
June 13, 1974; Effective Date: October 3, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The difficult general economic situation and unfavorable weather
conditions have had a negative impact on the Borrower (the Jamaica Development
Bank) and the project. As a result, arrears on principal and interest payments
have risen to unacceptable levels. The Jamaica Development Bank has initiated
an in-depth review of its loan portfolio, including the reappraisal and
rescheduling of loans and the strengthening of collection activities.
Ln. No. 1032 Third Highway Project; US$13.5 million of July 26, 1974;
Effective Date: September 27. 1974; Closing Date: March 31. 1980.
Construction has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions,
redesign of some sections, unsuccessful tenders and labor problems. Addi-
tional delays have been experienced because of the departure of qualified
personnel from the Ministry of Works and because of the lack of equipment and
equipment failures. Project implementation has been improving and the project
is now scheduled to be completed by late 1980.
Ln. No. 1043 Airport Development Project; US$12.5 million of October 2, 1974;
Effective Date: March 14, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
All major contracts have now been awarded, but earlier delays
encountered during the design and award phase, mean that the project completion
date will slip from 12 to 18 months, and the project cost will probably exceed
appraisal estimates by about 10%. Though execution of work in progress has
been slower than expected, the Government's tight fiscal situation makes the
revised construction schedule more acceptable. The Airports Authority's
aggressive management has improved this institution's financial position in
spite of reduced traffic and high inflation. Nonetheless, the Authority will
be unable to supply its contribution to the project financing plan. The
shortfall will be made up by the Government with help from the Venezuelan
Investment Fund.
Ln. No. 1146  Kingston Sewerage and Water Supply Project; US$15 million of
July 23, 1975; Effective Date: June 24, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
After some initial delays in establishing the project unit,
project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. Construction has begun
on all of the subcomponents of the water supply construction program and been
completed on one of them.
Ln. No. 1284 Second Population Project; US$6.8 million of June 17, 1976;
Effective Date: August 30, 1976; Closing Date: December 31. 1980.
Civil works and procurement are on schedule and project costs are
within appraisal estimates. The project is proceeding satisfactorily.

Ln. No. 1464  Rural Development Project; US$15 million of June 29, 1977
Effective Date: October 14. 1977; Closing Date: June 30. 1981.
After initial delays due to administrative problems, implemen-
tation has improved and fieldwork in all project components has been initiated.
Preparatory selection work of prospective settlers is progressing satisfac-
torily, but the physical settling of selected farmers has been constrained
by the lack oi. land survey services. Delays in implementation have caused
cost overruns in some project components.
Ln. No. 1516  Second Power Project; US$20 million of March 6, 1978;
Effective Date: June 1, 1978; Closing Date: September 30. 1982.
Delays of about 4 to 6 months have been experienced in the
initial steps of project execut'ion, as well as with the selection of key
personnel.  A slow-down in economic activity and a devaluation of the Jamaican
dollar have strained the borrower's finances. The Government has granted an
increase in tariffs to help ease the situation. The Project description has
been amended to incorporate the project component for rehabilitating existing
generating units and for purchase of spare parts. The new component will be
financed by a $3.3 million loan to Jamaica from the OPEC Special Fund made
under a loan agreement dated December 19, 1978. The Bank will act as the
administrator of the OPEC Special Fund loan.
Ln. No. 1517 Sugar Rehabilitation Project; US$18 million of March 6, 1978;
Effective Date: June 1, 1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
The project is proceeding on schedule.
Ln. No. 1609 Small Scale Enterprise Development Project; US$7 million of
August 2, 1978; Effective Date: December 29, 1978;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
Implementation is proceeding as scheduled. The program has
received substantial support from the commercial banking system and other
financial intermediaries. The work on the proposed manufacturing sector
survey has been initiated. The commitment under Sub-Program I (modern small
scale enterprises - $4.5 millLon) will start by July 1979. The commitment
under Sub-Program II (very small scale enterprises - about $2.0 million) has
been delayed due to the organLzation problem faced by the Small Enterprises
Development Corporation (SEDCO), the implementing agency. However, appropriate
actions are being taken to strengthen SEDCO.
