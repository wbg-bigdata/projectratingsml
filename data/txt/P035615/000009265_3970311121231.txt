MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
FOR A COMMUNITY NUTRITION PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Pepublic of Senegal for SDR 11.7 million, the equivalent of
US$18.2 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a project for
cormmunity nutrition. WFP through parallel cofinancing will contribute the equivalent of US$5.2
million. Germany (KfW) will finance an equivalent of US$3.0 million through parallel financing.
Thc Govemment will contribute the equivalent of US$ 1.6 million.
PART I. COUNTRY POLICIES AND IDA ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
A. Background
2.        Senegal is a lower-middle income country with a population of 7.8 million, growing at
2.7% per year, and an average per capita income of US$470, unequaLly distributed. It is better off
th  some of its Sahelian neighbors, but more urbanized (40% of the population). It faces many of
their constraints, including rapid population growth, economic stagnation and high unemployment,
dependence on a single agricultural commodity (groundnuts), arid land and declining rainfall.
Health and education have generally improved over the past decade. However, life expectancy is
only'49 years of age, there is chronic malnutrition of children under five years old, a growing
incidence of onchocerciasis in rural areas, widescale malaria, diarrhea, and respiratory disease.
3.        Over the past decade, dramatic declines in formal sector activity have, combined with
longer-term trends, plunged the country into a severe and prolonged economic recession. The
Governmne launched adjustment and stabilization programs in the early 1980s, resulting in partial
liberalization of agriculture, fiscal stabilization through austere expenditure contaction, and
financial reform. But this imternal adjustment was insufficient to improve the competitiveness of
the economy and achieve the type of economic growth that would have a strong impact on poverty.
The Januaiy 1994 devaluation of the CFA franc offers an opportunity to regain competitiveness
and to reverse economic performance by improving rural incomes through higher prices for the
most important revenue source of the poor (groundnuts) and by encouraging other export-oriented
industries, sach as fishing, tourism, agro-processing, and small manurn.
4.        The economic crisis has particularly affected vulnerable groups in Senegal. While the
devaluation is expected to promote long-term economic growth in Senegal, it has led to a
deterioration of incomes and food access for vulnerable groups in the short term. For example,
food expendites, which represent 70% of the household budget of the poor increased nearly 40
percent during 1994. The urban poor are particularly afficted by increases in the prices of
imported food. In early 1994, the Govemnment of Senegal introduced accompanying measures
aimed at passing the benefits of the parity change on to rural producers; limiting the wage bill;
reducing regressive levels of taxation, while balancing fiscal and credit measures to control
inflation; and improving the availability of social services in health and education by increasing
budgetary appropriations to these sectors. In the short tern, temporarY measures to miiize
increases in the prices of certain basic food and non-food goods (bread, rice, edible oils, kerosene,
medicines, and basic health care) were adopted.



-2-
B. Human Resource Development and Poverty Alleviation
5.        Altlhough significant improvements have been recorded sintcC independence, the overall
health, nutrition, and education status is still vcry poor. The under 5 mortality rate is over 100 per
1,000 live births, and less than one infant in two has been vaccinated. Maternal mortaity is over
500 per 100,000 live births. The population is characterized by a high fertility rate (5.9%/a)
associated with a low contraceptive prevalence ratc (less than 10%). Recent household survey data
(1992) indicate that one-third of the Senegalese population did not have the necessary minimum
daily caloric intake. The poor spend a higher percentage of their income on rice than on any other
food item and, on average, receive more income from groundnuts than from any other source. For
women, the sources of income (e.g., cultivating their own plots, petty trading) are very limited.
There are significant gaps in providing access to primary health care for both urban and rural
dwellers, expanding preventive medicine, and improving the availability of affordable essential and
generic drugs. Despite efforts made to improve primary health care, including family planning
services, and to decentralize health management, the health sector continues to be characterized by
financial and staff management constaint which prevent the establishmnent of a sustainable and
efficidnt national health care delivery system. Illiteracy rates are among the highest in the world,
particularly among rural women. In 1990, an estimated 86% of women aged 15 and over were
illiterate compared with 60% of men. In rural areas, over 90% of women were illiterate. Even
among women aged 15-35, years of peak fertility, and motherhood, illiteracy rates average about
90% in rural areas and 55% in urban areas.
6.        Senegal also faces environmental difficulties, such as soil degradation, the salinization
of agricultural land in low-lying coastal areas, and loss of forest cover. It is estimated that in some
areas, soil fertility is declining by 3-5% a year while forestry resources are decreasing by 1.2% a
year. This land degradation has been exacerbated by the decline in rainfall over the last 25 years
and the lack of investment and natural resources management. The high rate of urban population
growth which reflects land shortage and very poor income opportunities and amenities in rural
areas, is taking its toll on the capacity of the urban environment to meet food and wood fuel needs.
7.        To compensate for the hardships of the poorest population groups, particularly in
urban areas, resulting from declining income, the Govemment plans to provide direct assistance to
certain vulnerable groups by facilitating the establishment of fmily- or commnity-oriented
projects aimed at halting a further deterioration of already high malnmition rates. It is in this vein
that the Presidency created a National Commission for the Fight Against Malnutrition and
requested IDA's support.  The proposed project, which will complement other ongoing
employmmt/fod security efforts of the Public Works Executing Agency (AGETIP), a privately
operated agency, supported by IDA, the World Food Program (WFP), and Gennany (KfW), is a
response to this request It also presents a challenge and an opportuity to lay the basis for a long-
term program to address the country's entrenched nutrition problems, an objective towards which
the proposed project hopes to contribute.
C. Nutrition and Food Security Situation
8.        The main nutrition problem - and the effect of food insecurity in Senegal - is chronic
protein-calorie malntrition. Average levels of caloric intake have been barely adequate in both
rural and urban areas for many years. All uwban zones in Senegal show caloric inadequacy,
estimted to be 80% of normal consumption below which households are considered in a state of



-3 -
nutritional risk. Throughout Senegal, but particularly in the urban areas, rice consumption has
become an important part of the cereal diet. In urban areas, morc than 98% of noon meals, 50% of
evening meals, and 20-50% of momitig meals use rice as thc staple. Thc phasing out of subsidies
for rice is likely to cause hardship for low income people, particularly because in the short-run the
supply response is not cxpectcd to provide adequate stocks of low-cost coarse grains to substitute
for the morc expensive ricc. Unless the urban-poor households are ablc to reduce their non-food
expcnditures by the amount of real income loss, and transfer these amounts to food expenditures,
the result will be further nutritional deterioration.
9.       The 1992 Priority Survey found that 29% of children under five ycars of age were
chronically malnourished. Yet, a baseline survey conducted after devaluation in 1994 during the
pilot phase of this project indicated that roughly 30% of childrcn under three years of age suffered
from moderate to severe malnutrition. Malnutrition begins before birth, and in Senegal about 10%
of children are low birthweight babies (less than 2.5 kg). Iron deficiency anemia is a severe public
health problem with 63% of children estimated to be anemic. Significant regional and seasonal
vitamin A deficiency was found, while iodine deficiency is also considered a problem. Fifteen
percent of women of reproductive age have a low Body Mass Index, indicating chronic energy
deficiency in this cohort, which is usually a good marker of the nutritional status in infnts.
10.       Large differences in malnutrition rates have been found dependig on the socio-
economic profile of the community; for instance in one poor area (Guediawaye), the proportion of
children with chronic malnutrition is 1.6 times higher than in another (Medina). Even in the same
suburb of Dakar, there are great disparities, dependug mainly on whether the area is a squatter or
a planned area. In the Pikine area, chronic malnutrition rates were higher in the squatter areas of
Yeumbel and Medira Gounass than tW  were in the planned neighborhoods of Pikine Extension
and Pikine Ancien. The principal causes for this malnutrition situation in Senegal are poverty, lack
of good feeding practices, food insecurity (especially during critical periods for the household),
endemic diseases, ivadequacy of potable water and poor sanitation.
PART II. THE COMMUNITY NUTRITION PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
11.       The project's development objectives are to: (i) halt a deterioration in the nutritional
status of vulnerable groups (malnourished children under three years of age, and pregnant and
nursing women) in targeted poor urban neighborhoods; (ii) provide potable water to unserviced
neighborhoods targeted under the nutrition program; and (iii) enhance household food security
among poor urban populations and households "at risk" in targeted rural areas during critical
periods of vulnerability. Specific implementation objectives are to: (i) demonstrate the foasibility
of targeted, efficient and cost-effective delivery of community nutrition interventions; and (ii)
execute a poverty-oriented program through AGETIP, rather han a mnistry, applying delegated
contract management to local entrepreneurs, such as women and youth groups, community
associations, and local Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).
B. Project Description
12.       This project starts with the premise that it is possible to build on the institutional
capacity of a non-govemmental institution such as AGETIP to achieve social sector goals in
poverty stricken areas, often difficult to penetrate by traditional public sector institutions. It



-4-
combines AGETIP's practical experience in manAgcment and contracting oversight, and its know-
how in social mobilization, with a package of targetd nutrition and food security interventions that
arc, in the main, community-driven, and community-owned.  It brings together multiplc
complemcntary objectives with multiple interventions, ranging from food supplernntation, to
income transfer, to improving beneficiary knowledgc and self-capacity. Most of the rcsource flows
are to-and remain within-te community, whether i food supplemcnts or the staff costs of the
implementing entities, such as the micro-entrepreneur. ?MICs) or their supervisors (the NGOs also
called Maitre d'oeuvre conmmunautaires, MOCs).
13.       The project components are: (i) a nutrition program and a rclated small fund for
research and development; (ii) a potable water program; and (iii) a pilot rural household food
security program. An integral part of these three components will be (iv) social mobilization and
informationteducation/communication (IEC) campaigns; (v) training, to build local capacity for
nutrition/health service delivery; and (vi) a management information system for monitoring and
evaluation.
14.      The proposed project will be IDA's first free-standing nutrition project in Senegal and
one of the first projects of this kdnd in Africa. It is not an emergen,y intervention, but an
experimental one that attempts to test an innovative approach, i.e. a private delivey mechanism to
assist targeted vulnerable groups in ihe area of nutrition. Iimportant lessons provided by IDA's
experience in the nutrition sector in other regions of the world and with health projects in Africa
are that strong political commitnent by government, community ownership and involvement of all
stakeholders in the decision-making process are crucial for successfil implementation.  The
creation of the National Commission for the Fight Against Malnutrition, with the strong support
from the President of Senegal, is an encouraging example of Govenwent commitment to address
the problem of malnutrition among its most vulnerable population groups. The preparation of the
proposed project has addressed broad ownership aspects. A rapid beneficiary assessment and a
Planning by Objectives workshop or ZOPP (Ziel-Orientierte Projelt Planung) was carried out to
identify project objectives and target groups, to understand where coping strategies are inadequate
to ensure household food security and good nutritional status of segments of the target population,
to define jointly with the targeted population appropriate nutrition inteventions, and detennine the
willingess and mechanisms by which the target group would participate in the implementation of
the nutntion component. This project, which has been developed by a six-month pilot testing, will
cornplement ongoing donor-assisted nutrition projects which provide EEC on nutrition rehabilitation
of malnourished children through the health system.
15.       The nutrition program will involve EEC interventions aimed at changing nutrition
behavioral patterns, supported by supplementary feeding, and child growth monitoring, some basic
prevaeive health care through a refeal service of severely malnourished children to nutriton or
health facilities; and a fund for research and development. Micro-entrepreneurs, such as women's
groups, community associations and youth groups, will operate the community nutrition centers
(CNC). A weekdy take-home supplement will be provided to pregnant and nursing women and to
malnourished children aged 6 to 36 months (including siblings of malnourished children below
three years) in selected poor urban areas of 10 cities. One hundred grams of the dry supplement
will provide 370-400 kcal and around 15 grams of protein in keeping with WHO-UNICEF
standards. The supplement would be provided only a&icr group IEC or individual counseling. A
monthly growth monitoring session will be held by specially trained CNC staff. Beneficianes who
receive full service (i.e., food supplement, growth monitoring, and IEC) will be charged a fee of
CFAF 50/week for their participation, in keeping with the Ministry of Health's current practice of



-  -
partial cost rccovery. This fec will bc revicwed annually iir light of project objectives. The fees
collected will bc managed b) the Local Stcering Committees in collaboration witd the MICs, and
will be used exclusively for the CNC's upkeep and for emergency situations. Basic preventive
health will bc supportod through refrrals of chronically malnourished children to nutrition
rchabilitation centers, and gencrally, by referral to health posts and centers for basic health care.
The provision of basic health care by the CNCs will be supported through the ongoing IDA-
assistod Health Project (Cr. 2255-SE). To fonnalize relationships between the Ministry of Health
(MOE) and AGETIP, a Convention has been signed between these two entities, which spells out
the mechanisrn by which the Community Health Committecs of the MOH will ensure iat essential
drugs (vitamin A, oral rehydration salt, iron and folic acid, deworning and malaria tablets) will be
made available to CNCs's beneficiaries. WFP will finance the local production of the food
supplement through monetization of imported food aid and will coordinate the activities of the
entire food chain from local procurement to processing, packaging, storage, distribution to the and
quality control at all levels. The experience of the pilot phase has demoted the need to provide
AGETIP some flexibility over the delivery mechanism but also over the composition of the food
supplement and packaging, over a future diversification of supply sources, and ways of addressing
technical issues as they arise. Therefore, a Special Fund will be created and managed by AGETIP.
The Fund is principally designed to encourage development of small entrepreneurs in the food
supply and processing business in selected peri-urban and rural areas in the vicinity of CNCs; and
to bring about needed program improvements identified during project implementation.
16.       The water program will supply potable drinking water and improve the general health
conditions of the population concemed in t  targeted communities that do not have vster
connections. During the first year, the program nwill cover 12 poor neighborhoods that have poor
water services, of which five are in Dakar and seven in the provincial towns (Diourbel one,
Kaolack three, Ziguinchor three). In these areas, standpipes are to be insalled and managed by
private entrepreneurs. The rural household food security program will formulate and test
targeted approaches to assist chronically food insecure and malnourshed women and children
living below the poverty line in rural areas, by providing available information and advice, food
supplements, food or cash equivalents for work, principally through labor-intensive infrastructure
and income-generating activities. A measured approach to implementation beyond peri-urban
areas is planned. For the mrual program to benefit firom what is learned during the first phase of
project operations in the ten priority urban ceers, it will only becomc operational during the third
year of implementation.
17.       The social mobilization and EEC programs will encourage participation and
behavioral change among the target populations. The social mobilization program will: (i)
mobilize political support and collaboration at the national, regional and conmmunity level,
including local leaders; (ii) ensure that the community has a sense of ownership and participates in
project planning and execution; and (iii) imnprove the capacity of communities to provide, and
broaden access to, nutrition and related health services. The training component will include (i)
on-the-job training services related to work orgamzation, management, and technical and
nutitional training to contacted small and micro.entrepreneurs; (ii) a traing program for
supervisory services, contracted through NGOs; and (iii) training in planning and conducting IEC
activities, including strategy preparation, materials development, use of materials, and inter-
personal commumications techniques, provided to local consultants who will train small and nucro-
entrepreneurs and local NGOs, and participants.



-6 -
1a.       A monitoring and evaluation system will: (i) support the establishment of a povcrty
task force at the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Plan to monitor and strengthcn the
Govcrnmcnt's monitoring and evaluation capacity in nutrition, and to analyze thc cost-effectiveness
and appropriateness of various intervention strategics; (ii) determine the progress of project
activities according to plamned targcts and schedule, and to propose appropriatc corrective actions;
(iii) verify and update existing information on the extent, severity and location of various forms of
malnutridion; (iv) establish the impact of the project activities on nutritional status and to relate
these changes to other socio-cconomic and behavioral variables; (v) provide a basis for ongoing
evaluation of the project effectiveness by local, district and national level govemmcnt; and (vi)
permit the continuous review and calibration of the program design. These mutually supportive
efforts offer the potential of laying the basis for a longer term strategy to deal with nutrition and
household food security problems.
C. Project Implementation
19.       This project is seen as a key vantage point from whicl to consider widcr policy issues
related to hunger and malnutrition. Activity oversight is in the hands of the National Commission
for the Fight Agairst Malnutrition, recently created by the Presidency for the purpose of ensuring
that a social safity net exists for poverty households. It will be the guiding force for this project.
It is composed of representatives of the Presidency, the Prime Minister's Office, the Ministries of
Economy, Finance and Plan, Health and Social Action, and Women, Children and Family Affairs,
AGETIP, and the NGOs. The National Commission places special cnphasis on this project which
represents an important testing ground for indigenous Senegalese social sector approaches, and for
fiuture national nutrition policy and programs. AGETIP's involvement in the preparation of this
operation wa, supported not only by the Govermnent of Senegal, but also by other local
stkeholders that have collaborated with AGETIP in the past (small entrepreneurs, eonsulting
firns, NGOs) and foreign donors that have entrusted AGETIP with implementation of some of
their ongoing operations (WFP, Genrany).
20.       The President of Senegal designated AGETIP as the executing agency because
AGETIP has dernonstrated its ability to execute a broad range of public works projects
successfully and expeditiously, based on its strong managerial and operational capacities. To
bring these skills to bear in executing community-based nutrition prograns, a new Nutrition
Management Division (NMD) has been created and will include a small technical staff specialized
in the areas of nutrition and health, water, IEC and social mobilization, traing, monitoring and
evaluation. AGETIP will execute the project under the established procedures of "delegated
contract management", with extensive use of short-term consultants. At the mid-term review an
assessment will be carried out to determine the feasibility of separating the NMD from AGETIP to
make it a stand-alone agency. There will also be a review as to wheher other entities could
execute delegated contract management responsibilities similar to those performed by AGETIP. In
light of the growing role of AGETP in delegated project contracting, this action aims at lessening
the monopoly risk that may otherwise be created.
21.       To ensure local ownership of th project, District Steeing Committees playing an
advisory role, will be given official status by decree of the Governor of the region. The committees
will be composed of representatives of the Governor, "Priet" or "Sous-Pr6ft", the District
medical officer, the mayor, neighborhood leaders, as well as agents from technical services
imvolved in the project. Local comnittees will be organized in each target neighborhood, in order



-7 -
to participate in the elaboration of the social mobilization strategy pertinent to the neighborhood
and to provide periodic feedback to AGETIP on the ovcrall projcct impact and performance.
22.       The nutrition program  will be implemented by  -icro-cnt=rcneursincluding
economic interest groups, women groups, community associations, and youth groups. They will be
responsiblc for identifying and motivating beneficiaries, for ensuring greater community
participation, and for delivering nutrition services. Nutrition center supervisors will train and
supervise the small and micro-entrepreneurs responsible for managing the supplementary fecdirg
program at thc community level. A roster of pre-qualified small and micro-entrepreneurs and
supervisors will be submitted for IDA approval no later than July 1, 1995. Selection of
entrepreneurs and supervisors will be based on competitive bidding, as spelled out in a Manual of
Procedures. Local health structures, supported through the ongoing IDA-assisted Health Project,
will participate in the project and provide primary care for pregnant and nursing women and
children referred by the nutrition centers for periodic clinical exams and other hcalth services.
23.       The water program will be implemtented under the supervision of AGETIP, which will
sub-contract the technical execution to local enterprises according to a schedule of charges
established by the National Water Company (SONES). For the purpose of greater involvement of
the beneficiary population, the contracted enterprises will recruit workers and unskilled laborers
from the targeted neighborhoods. AGETP will enter into an agreement with SONES to ensure
technical standards are net by the local contractors.
24.       The rural household food security program will be implemented and supervised by
conununity based organzations and volunteers, as done, for instance, under the peri-urban
component. More detailed preparation of this component will be undertaken during the first two
years of project imnplementation. This time period will be used to determine the type of works and
to specify the most appropriate time for this intervention. It is envisaged that this component will
become filly operational in the third year of project implementation.
25.       Project implementation will be guided by a detailed Manual of Procedures whic',
anong others things, will stipulate enty and exit criteria for program participation to avoid food
dependency, and establish linkages with the health system to ensure referral health services. The
Manual will spell out objective targeting criteria for cost-effective targefing and specific indicators
to monitor project implementation. To improve coordination with the health system, contractual
arrangements between AGETIP and the MO  will be defined in the Manual of Procedures. The
accounting system of AGETIP will be modified to incorporate this diversification of its operations.
D. Project Sustainability
26.       The project's sustainability has been enhanced through important design features.
First, AGETIP, as the executing agency, has demonstrated efficient and cost-effective management
of community programs. Second, gmssroots contating will guarantee not only ownership and
participation by the communities, but also low administrativ unit costs. Third, broader and longer
term policies affecting the nutritional status of vulnerable groups wnll be considered during project
execution. Sustamnability is closely linked to macroeconomic performance, namely ta only
through economic growth and cost-effective public expenditures will the Govenmment be able to
take over the nutrition activities started under the project.

F. Rationle for IDA Iuvolveanmt
28.       The CAS sttemt wa revewed by the Board - February 16, 199. It contains
a full discussion of recent econoic developments, and IDMs assisbnce program. This project is
filly cosit  wih IDA strategy, which is to assist Senegal to achieve susainable economic
growth with equity and targeed poverty reduction. Its focus is: (a) to promote   iveness in
order to make the econmy more rponsve and to creae more oportunties for the private seetr;
(b) to comlete stuctural refrs in agricuture; and (c) to deliver essential services efficiently and
ifecvely. Moreover, a central aspect of the Banks partship with Senegal is the str i
of the quality of the disaogue between Govermnent and civil society to enhace participation and
ownershp. The 1990 World Development Report provides the basis for IDA's two-pronged
approach. (a) inceasing economic growth and incomes, maly throigh labor-itensive methods;
and (b) inproving access to basic social services. A complement to this approach is assuring
dequa   socal safety nets for the truly vulnerable. IMA's main nutrition objective is to assist the
Govrmn in adoptng staties and cost-effective prognrms to deal wihi the hunger problems of
the most vulnable groups. IDA is well equipped to play the importa  catytic role required on
te managemet side of the proam. It has played a critical role in a number of important policy
refoms in the human resources sector in Senga and is best positioned to mobilize needed
aismce firm the donor's commuity and to influence govements stratey.
G. Agreed Actions
29.       The Government has agreed on the following actons:
a. As conditions of effectiveness: (i) WFP's cwfinnation in terms and conditions satisfactory
to IDA and reflected in WFP's Grat  Agrement of he availabiliLy of fiuds to purchase the local
ingredients for the purposes of the supplemey feeding pmgam; (ii) deposit by te Goverment
of the equivalen in CFA francs of an agggate amount of not less than US$0.4 million in
AGETIP's account as its countpat contrbution for the first year of project iplementation; (iii)
the appoitment of the key staff of the Nutition Mnagment Division by AGETIP; (iv) the
signng of an agreeent betwee AGETIP and SONES for the purpose of implet   he water
program under Ums and conditions acceptable to IMA; (v) the adaption and impl ion by
AGETIP of an acmcui    and financid managent system acceptable to IDA; and (vi) the
employment of i dt  audXitors acceptble to IDA for the audit of project records, accounts,
and finaial s_men.

b. As condition of disbursement for the rural household food security program: tho
approval by IDA during the mid-tamin roview ofl a plan of action and an investment program to be
presented by AGETIP.
H. Poverty Category
30.       Thc proposcd project is a povwrty-targetcd intervention, geared to halting a fuzrthor
doterioration in the nutritional status of the most vulnerable groups in tagetd poor neighborhoods
of Sencgal, roducing food insecurity in tlhese areas, and generating employment and incomc for
community groups through the promotion of small-scale activities.
1. Environmental Aspects
31.       The overall environmental impact of the project is expected to bc neutral to positive,
Thc cnvironmental category is C. Thc impact of the small public works to be fimmeed under the
project, such as th rehabilitation of community infrastructure, will be neutrl on the environment.
Componant, such as the water program, will have a positive impact on the environment, by
providing potable water to the beneficiaries of the targeted neighborhoods.
J. Program Objective Categories
32.      In addition to the poverty alleviation measures discussed in pam. 30 above, the project
promotes the development of small and micro-entrepreneurs, comnunity participation, and the
involvement of NGOs and local consultants in implementation into the hands of the target group
populations and thereby cnsuring long-term  sustinability.  The project responds to the
Governmentes objectives of human resource development and peverty alleviation.
K. Participatory Approach
33.       Project design benefited from  te collaboration of a vaziety of institutions,
stakholders, and beneficiaries. The National Commission played a strong role in supporting
AGETIP's commnunity mobilization efforts and in ensuring coordination among ministries involved
in project implementation. A Planning by Objectives Workshop or ZOPP was held during project
preparation for key stakeholders involved in the planning of the project. A beneficiary assessment
of poor urban households to examine changes in household food consumption behavior following
the devaluation and to solicit these households' views on a supplemental feeding program was
carried out during project preparation.
34.       The ZOPP approach will continue thmughout project execution to assure systmatic
client consultation. Adjustments will be made to reflect participant views. Furthermore, the
project will provide virtually continuous feedback to all conced stalcholders, includig donors,
on project performance. In sunm, the project will encourage communities to contribute to the
project's success, and in so doing develop NGO and private sector capacity to deliver social
services and snhen institutional capacity of local comnwmities and grassroots groups to
execute development projects.



- 10-
J. Project Benefits
35.       The project will have two main benefits. First, the immediate impact is intended to
halt a deterioration in the nutritional status of the most vulnerable groups in the poorest urban
areas, estimated at a total target population of 469,000 (about 230,000 malnourished children
under three years of age and 120,000 nursing and pregnant women receiving food, growth
monitoring and IEC services; and 119,000 mothers and children receiving only growth monitoring
and IEC serviocs). Based on preliniinary estimates the project is expected to reach about 30% of
urban malnourished children in targeted areas. Nutrition education activities should set in motion
behavioral changes and adoption of better child-feeding practices, leading subsequently to
nutritional improvement of children under 3 years. Increased access to safe drinking water through
the water program should reduce the incidence of diarrhea and water-bome diseases aflfcting the
nutritional status of 174,000 residents in the targeted neighborhoods for the first year of operation.
Total beneficiaries for the subsequent years are estimated at 522,000, totaling 696,000 over the
life of the project for the water program. The total number of beneficiaries for the nutrition and
water prograns is thus estimated at nearly 1.2 million persons. The proposed project will also lead
to an increased dmand and use of health services. An additional benefit of the rual household
food security and water programs will be the provision of development-oriented infastructure in
treted rural and urban areas.
36.       Second, the project will establish local capacity to deliver community-managed
nutrition services with private sector efficiency, both in terms of mangement and administraive
cost contaimnent. It will also contribute to capacity building of NGOs by providing training in the
supenrision of community nutrition centers and IEC methods. Furthermore, closer collaboration
between NGOs and public health services will improve the delivery of social programs geared to
the most vulnerable households.
K. Risks
37.       One risk relates to the production of the local food supplement, which currndy is in
the hands of a single producer/supplier. However, altemative production sources for the food
supplement will be identified during the first year of operation, through competitiv bidding. This
broadening of supplier sources should address risks inherent in the existing virtal monopoly
situation. Another risk is the need for close coordination among the many stakeholders which
could pose a logistical problem, and, that implementation might be delayed by shortfalls in
community mobilization, organization, and tmining. However, the detailed Manual of Pmcedures,
firm supervision procedures, extensiv testing of program opeations, active invohemnt of the
National Commission in social mobilization efforts, and a rigorous training program, should
respond adequately to these potential problems. There is also the risk that nutrition-health
coordination arrangements between AGETIP and the Ministry of Health do not meet expectations.
A clearly defined contracual arrangement between AGETIP and the Ministy of Health, as weU as
linkages with the ongoing IDA healtih project, should assure the necessary coordination. Finally,
there is the risk that the project's administrative costs are higher than estimated. In the past,
AGETIP's contractual management slklls, supported by its strong management information system,
have proven highly effective in terms of cost containment and administrative performance.
