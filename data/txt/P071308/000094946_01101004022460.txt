A. Program Purpose and Project Development Objective
1. Program purpose and program phasing:
Mauritania has been engaged for more than a decade in ambitious policy reforms that have affected all
aspects of the country's political, economic and social life. In 1991, a pluralistic democracy was
established with the adoption of a constitution that guaranteed basic liberties and the separation of
executive, legislative and judicial powers, and introduced the practice of universal suffrage for the election
of the President of the Republic and of the peoples' representatives at the National Assembly. The program
of economic reforms, begun in 1992, redirected the Government toward its essential mandate of regulation
and achieved significant progress toward the adjustment of the macro-economic framework, liberalization
of market prices, improvement of the legal and judiciary enviromnent for business activities, and
development of the private sector. At the same time, the country continued its rapid urbanization process,
with urban population from less than 4% in 1962 to the current estimate of 61%, with more than 67% of
the urban population concentrated in Nouakchott (about 612,000 inhabitants) and Nouadhibou (about
76,000 inhabitants).
As a result of these policies, Mauritania has achieved an economic growth rate of 4.4% between 1992 and
1999. Despite this good performance, the poverty situation remains worrisome with about one household
in two still living in poverty. The Government is, however, strongly committed to taking immediate steps to
reduce poverty, as indicated in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The four main themes of the
Poverty Reduction Strategy, which was presented to the IDA Board in January 2001, are: (i) accelerating
economic growth, (ii) implementing targeted public investment programs to reduce inequities and improve
the resource base of the poor, (iii) developing human resources and access to essential infrastructure, and
(iv) promoting true institutional development, based upon good governance and full participation of all
parties involved in poverty alleviation.
During the past decade, Mauritania has made considerable effort to improve the overall level of education
and skills of its population, especially that of women. With the support of several IDA-financed education
projects, coupled with efforts from other development agencies, the Government has expanded educational
opportunities in primary and secondary education and in vocational and technical training. As a result, the
total gross enrollment ratio at the primary level increased from 46.8% in 1990/91 to 86% in 1998/99.
Enrollment at the secondary level also increased by 56 percent from 35,221 in 1990/91 to 60,069 in
1998/99, with girls representing 41 percent of the total. The number of students in technical education
doubled from 880 to 1,682 with girls representing about one third of the total. Similar enrollment trends
have been observed in higher education institutions, where the number of students increased from 7,527 in
1990 to about 13,000 in 1999. Political will to improve education achievements, particularly those of girls
and women, has been the main driving force behind those achievements.
Notwithstanding these remarkable quantitative achievements, there are serious concerns about the quality
and efficiency of the education system.
*   The mastery of curricula content and acquisition of basic concepts and skills in primary and secondary
education is low due to outdated curricula and teaching methods; science education in secondary
schools is poor; and the exposure of the vast majority of students to foreign languages is low,
especially the French language. In fact, while French is widely used in society and essential for highly
qualified jobs, it is taught effectively only to the 5.5% of the students in primary education who enroll
in the bilingual stream. The rest of the students enroll either in the Arabic stream (94%) or in the local
language stream (0.5%), which impart poor French skills.
*   Admission rates at the primary level are extremely high (93%) but retention is low (55%) caused by
high repetition and dropout rates.

*   Public resource allocation to education, as a portion of GDP, has been declining significantly, from
5.2% in 1985 to 3.5% in 1998, suggesting that the expansion of the system has been financed through
a steady decline of the unit cost.
*   The technical, vocational, and higher education systems are not sufficiently diversified and lack
flexibility. The unemployment rate among the higher education graduates is estimated at 30%.

(I) With students in TVT institutions under the responsibility of ministries other than the MEN, the total enrollment
reaches 2,670 in 1999.
(2) Not including the Mauritanian students in foreign countries, who were 2,439 in 1999.
To consolidate the quantitative achievements of the past 15 years and to tackle the above-mentioned issues,
the Government of Mauritania embarked on an education sector reform. In 1999, Parliament approved the
education reforn law (the Reforn) which seeks to improve the quality of education and restructure and
expand the education system in ways that are relevant to the present and future needs of the economy.
Specifically, the Reform aims at: (i) combining the existing three education streams into one unified
system, where Arabic and French are the main languages of instruction; (ii) reinforcing the teaching of
foreign languages by introducing French in second grade in primary education and English in first grade in
lower-secondary education; (iii) introducing civic education instruction as a separate subject from 'Islamic
studies' at the primary and secondary levels; (iv) lengthening the duration of lower secondary schooling to
prepare for the provision of 10 years of basic education; and (v) putting greater emphasis on scientific
subjects and information technology in secondary education, particularly by adding physics as a new
subject in lower-secondary, and by introducing new courses to develop computer skills. A detailed
discussion of the Reform objectives and their implications for sector development can be found in Annex
13.

Further to promulgating the education reform law, the Government embarked on the preparation of a new
10-year Education Sector Development Program (ESDP), whose scope covers the formal education system
from preschool to tertiary and non-formal education and literacy. The program seeks to: (i) make
education more relevant by using French and Arabic as languages of instruction, (ii) provide improved
access to 10 years of good-quality education (basic education) for the vast majority of the young
Mauritanians while achieving equity, and (iii) make secondary education, technical and vocational training
and higher education more relevant to social needs and responsive to the demands of the labor market.
Improving the quality of an entire education system is a long-term undertaking which requires the main
stakeholders and managers of the system to periodically review progress and adjust courses. The proposed
program provides support to the ESDP in 2 phases, lasting 4 and 5 years respectively. The first or
"foundation" phase is essentially an intensive development phase which will establish structures, tools, and
skills necessary for meaningful expansion and consolidation during the second phase. Specifically, more
school places will be provided in primary education, the quality of education will be improved through the
implementation of the Reform in primary education, innovative programs to enhance the effectiveness of
technical, vocational and higher education will be piloted, and a sound institutional framework will be
developed. The second or "expansion" phase will extend the implementation of the reform to general
secondary education, and scale up the pilot programs in the technical, vocational and higher education
systems and a decentralized administration will be operational following the reinforcement of the
institutional and management capacity in the regions.
2. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The proposed credit will help the Government implement phase I of the ESDP, which aims at: (i)
implementing bilingual education at the primary and secondary levels of education, (ii) improving access
and equity, (iii) enhancing quality and increasing the intemal efficiency of the education system, and (iv)
improving the relevance and extemal efficiency of the vocational, technical, and higher education systems.
Expected outcomes include: universal access to primary education, increased completion rates, expanded
access to secondary education, and improved quality of education at all levels.
In order to achieve these objectives the program will focus on four major areas namely: (i) coverage: basic
education access to all, particularly the disadvantaged, girls, and children in hard to reach communities; (ii)
quality of the teaching and learning in schools -- basic physical infrastructure, adequately trained teachers,
and adequate supply of essential didactic materials; (iii) strengthening capacity for institutional and
organizational change - development of leadership and management skills for the design and
implementation of basic sector policies and strategies; and (iv) establishing an effective management
system -- pedagogic, administrative and financial management -- with clear management responsibilities
and procedures.
3. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
The ESDP has indicators for each project component and each sub-sector. The baseline and target values
for these indicators as well as their definition and data collection responsibilities will be detailed in the
Project Implementation Plan. Major outcome indicators, agreed upon with the MEN, to be achieved by
2005 and 2010 include the following:
Quality
i. Average achievement of learning objectives by primary education students to increase from 33%
- 5 -



in 1999 to 45% and 70% in 2005 and 2010, respectively. This indicator measures improvement in
learning achievement in primary education.
ii. Success rate in the basic education completion exam (BEPC, grade 9) to improve from 60% to
65% and 75% in 2005 and 2010, respectively. This indicator is a measure of the quality of
education in the first cycle of secondary education.
iii. Grade repetition in primary education to drop from 15% to 9% and 7% in 2005 and 2010,
respectively. This indicator measures the intemal efficiency of primary education.
Access and Equity
i. Percentage of primary schools offering 6 grades to increase from 17.5% to 45% and 100% in
2005 and 2010, respectively. This indicator measures progress toward the implementation of an
essential strategy to increase the number of students who complete primary education.
ii. Retention rate in primary education to improve from 55% to 67% and 78% in 2005 and 2010,
respectively. This indicator measures the percentage of students that start school and complete
primary education.
iii. Girls will represent 49% of secondary education enrollment (first cycle) in 2005, against 43% in
1999. This indicator measures gender equity in secondary education (gender difference in primary
education enrollment is already low).
Relevance and Effectiveness
i. At least 500 students to be enrolled in apprenticeship schemes in 2005 and 2,000 in 2010. This
indicator measures the relevance of vocational and technical training courses in relationship to the
needs of the economy.
ii. At least 15% of students in higher education to be enrolled in professionnally-oriented courses,
developed in consultation with enterprises, by 2005. This indicator measures the extent to which
the university system is adapted to labor market needs. The target for 2005 has been calculated
with the assumption that the physical facilities of the university will have been improved by that
date.
Financing and Management Capacity
i. The MEN operating budget, as a share of all state revenues, to increase from 13.5% in 1999 to
14.4% in 2005 and 15.5% in 2010. These percentages do not include other ministerial
expenditures on education and training activities. They measure the extent to which the
Govemment is sustaining a stipulated level of education financing in line with the program
requirements.
ii. The correlation rate between the number of teachers and the number of students per primary
school to improve from 79% to 85% in 2005. This indicator measures progress in improving the
MEN capacity to allocate teachers to schools in an efficient manner.
B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: CAS Report No. 16595           Date of latest CAS discussion: June 17, 1997
A CAS was discussed on June 17, 1997. A CAS Progress Report was prepared in November 1998. The
1997 CAS identifies weak human resource development as one of the major constraints to economic growth
- 6 -



in Mauritania. The strategy lists the improvement of human capital and employment creation as major
areas of intervention. The five main conditions necessary for the achievement of these goals include: (i)
achieving universal primary enrollment, (ii) improving the quality of primary, secondary and higher
education, (iii) strengthening job-oriented vocational training, (iv) encouraging private sector participation
in financing; and (v) delivery of training services and promoting efficiency in the allocation and use of
resources. The objectives proposed in the ESDP are all congruent with the strategies identified in the CAS,
particularly the improvement of education quality, the expansion of access to education, and the
strengthening ofjob-oriented technical and vocational training. The reform and deconcentration of public
adrninistration and services to local Government constitute another key element in the CAS and
Government strategy, and are fully supported by the ESDP.
The proposed program is also designed to achieve lasting results in the fight against poverty, and is a key
pillar of the Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP, IDA/SecM2001-0024 discussed by
the Board on February 6, 2001). In rural areas, where 76% of the poor live, the poverty assessment
showed that low income levels are correlated with low labor productivity, which are in turn determined to a
large extent by poor education status. In urban areas, the vast majority of workers from poor households
have no training, and most workers are completely unskilled even in the modem handicraft sector.
Educational opportunities are currently too scarce to improve this situation: 66% of young people lack any
formal training and 45% still leave the education system without completing primary education. By
fighting illiteracy and contributing to the development of a skilled workforce the proposed program will
play a key role in reaching the objectives associated with the main themes of the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Document, which are (i) accelerating economic growth and (ii) developing human resources and
improving access to essential infrastructure.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Overview of the system. The formal education system operated by the Ministry of Education consists of
six years of primary schooling (enseignementfondamental), three years of lower general secondary
education (college), and another three years of higher-general secondary education (Iycee). Instruction is
provided in three separate streams: (l)fiflire Arabe, (2)fiere bilingue, and (3) a very small stream that
uses local languages and which represents less than 0.5% of primary enrollment. Until 1999 it has proved
difficult for the Government to manage the quantitative and qualitative challenges posed by these multiple
systems and to define a coherent system. As a consequence of the implementation of the reform of 1999,
these streams are being merged gradually. The reform also seeks to implement a 10-year basic education
system by adding a fourth year to lower-secondary education in 2007.
Secondary technical education is provided by two-year programs offered after lower-secondary in
vocational schools, under the responsibility of various ministries, and in technical colleges and lycees,
under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education (MEN). Higher education is offered at the University
of Nouakchott and in five post-secondary specialized institutions. Primary teachers are trained at two
teacher training colleges, Ecoles Normales d'Instituteurs (ENI, in Nouakchott and Aioun); secondary
teachers are trained at the Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS, Nouakchott) which is associated with the
University of Nouakchott.
Results from several diagnostic studies undertaken between 1997 and 2000 have helped the Government of
Mauritania to identify the main issues that its education system faces. The key sectoral issues include: (i)
poor quality of education resulting in weak teaching and learning outcomes and low internal efficiency; (ii)
inadequate coverage resulting in limited and inequitable access to basic education; (iii) inadequate and
inefficient utilization of existing resources; (iv) weak institutional capacity for effective pedagogic,
- 7 -



administrative and financial management; (v) low external efficiency in higher education; and (vi) low
responsiveness of technical education and vocational training to the needs of the labor market.
Poor quality of education and weak learning outcomes. Poor quality of education limits the number of
qualified students who successfully graduate from each level of the sector. An assessment of pupil
performance during the recent sector study revealed that students at the primary level master on average
33% of the intended curriculum content. This national average conceals wide disparities that exist between
students in the worst performing schools mastering 10% of the curriculum content, against 80% in the best
performing schools. Overall performance at the end of the first cycle of secondary is much better with over
half of the students performing well but there are also wide gender differences. In 1998/99, the success rate
at the BEPC examination was 61% for males and 55% for females. Similar gender differences exist in the
results at the end of second cycle examinations. Baccalaureat results were extremely poor, with only 21%
for males and 10% for females obtaining pass grades. These poor outcomes derive from several factors
which include: (i) insufficient and variable supply of textbooks and teachers' guides in schools, (ii) the
absence of other essential didactic materials and equipment, (iii) inadequate pre-service teacher education
and insufficient provision for in-service teacher training, and (iv) ineffective supervision and pedagogic
support.
Government strategy is to revamp the entire learning environment in schools. Facilities that are in
disrepair will be rehabilitated and furnished. Teachers will be well trained both through
professionalized pre-service teacher education courses and demand-driven in-service teacher training
courses. More pedagogic support and guidance will be provided and teachers will be encouraged to be
innovative in their classroom practices. Feedback on students' examination performance will be
promoted to increase pedagogic effectiveness. To facilitate learning, the Government plans to use more
efficient distribution methods to ensure that sufficient quantities of textbooks in the core subjects are
available in all classrooms.
Low retention rates and inequitable access. Despite a relatively high admission rate of 93% into the first
grade, barely 55% of children complete the cycle of primary education. This level is also characterized by
high dropout and an average repetition rate of 15%. Wide gender and zonal disparities in retention rates
exist. For example in rural areas, the retention rate in primary education (percentage of students who
complete grade 6) is estimated at 43%, against 70% in urban areas. It is even lower for rural girls, among
whom only 3 8% reach grade 6. An in-depth analysis of the sector reveals that although there are demand
side factors that may constrain survival at school, the situation in Mauritania is mainly attributed to supply
factors. The major issue is the inadequate supply of school places caused by a high proportion of
incomplete schools. Approximately 83% of primary schools have an incomplete cycle, of which 60%
provide only two grades and the majority of these schools are in rural areas. This makes it difficult for
many children to continue their education once they reach the last grade offered by their school. For social
reasons, this situation has more negative consequences on girls who are less likely to attend and complete
schools than boys.
Government strategy. The Government's priority is to increase the number of school places by
building new schools. The majority of new schools will be complete and located in under-served rural
areas. Existing classrooms will be utilized more efficiently through the promotion of multigrade
teaching especially in areas where the school age population density is low, and will be retrofitted with
latrines and drinkable water. The Government will also increase the number of qualified bilingual
teachers who will cater to the needs of expanding enrollments.

Inefficient administrative and pedagogical management. Although administrative structures exist at the
regional level, management of the education system is still overly centralized. Regional education offices
depend heavily on the central Ministry for directives regarding personnel and staffing matters, preparation
of budgets and resource allocation. Management ineffectiveness also derives from weak resource
allocation and utilization procedures. There are severe weaknesses in the allocation of financial and human
resources from the center to the school level. The teacher posting system which is controlled from the
central Ministry causes considerable inequities between regions, districts and schools. The recent education
country status report noted that the allocation of funds and teachers to individual schools is characterized
by a high degree of variability (graph below). For instance, a school that has 4 teachers can vary in size
from 50 students to as many as 350 students. Administrative ineffectiveness is compounded by shortage of
personnel with management skills at all levels of the system. This has resulted in a weak capacity for
policy formulation and planning as well as financial management at the central, regional and district levels.
Management efficiency is also undermined by the absence of a clear monitoring and evaluation system.
Consequently there is very little or no room for feedback and adjustments regarding the implementation of
education policies and programs.
Government strategy. The Government plans to establish improved administrative and management
structures with clearly defined roles at the center, regional and district levels in order to bring authority
and responsibility for educational service delivery closer to schools and communities. The teacher
posting system will be rationalized and schools will have access to resources for school quality
enhancement programs. An education management infornation system (EMIS) will be established
and the capacity of staff at the central, regional and district levels to efficiently collect, analyze and
utilize data for policy and planning purposes will be reinforced. Training for educational and financial
management will be provided to officials at all levels who will be responsible for carrying out
administrative and financial functions. Guidelines for evaluating, monitoring and reporting system
performance will be developed.

Poorly adapted technical and vocational training. Since 1992, the Government has made efforts to
improve and expand the supply of technical and vocational training. During this period, student enrollment
-9-



increased from 1,426 to 2,439 and the number of teachers from 184 to 285. Despite this important growth,
the TVT has several serious deficiencies. First, technical and vocational training is poorly adapted to labor
market demands. Mauritania's labor market is characterized by the existence of a traditional and informal
sector, which absorbs the vast majority of the labor supply, and a modem sector which has a limited
absorptive capacity. Nevertheless, technical and vocational training activities, which in their majority are
publicly funded and provided, are geared essentially towards the needs of the modem sector. Second, the
technical education and vocational training services are not well adapted to the needs of the labor market.
The system is limited by the absence of reliable labor market information. Labor statistics which are
collected only for the modem sector conceal the real basis for analyzing employment trends, labor mobility
and the identification of skills shortages. Moreover, there is very little information on the external
efficiency of training centers which in turn makes planning and further resource allocation both from public
and private sources difficult. Third, there is weak coordination between technical and vocational training
and labor market institutions. Traditionally, TVT institutions are placed under the responsibility of too
many ministries, with no clear coordination mechanism among them.
Government Strategy. The Government intends to improve the quality and efficiency of the technical
and vocational education sector by improving links between the institutions and the labor market,
expanding training for the informal sector, increasing the participation of the private sector in financing
and managing training programs. The Government also intends to undertake a number of studies on
employment trends and opportunities as well as the training needs of private sector employers and
artisans. Revision of training programs will be based on the results obtained from these studies. To
strengthen coordination the Government intends to create an institution that will coordinate training
with employment and take the responsibility for policy analysis and relations with employers.
Low external efficiency in higher education. The higher education system was developed in the early
70s, with the creation of the Ecole National d'Administration and Ecole Nationale Sup&rieure, which
trained many of the country's civil servants. The University of Nouakchott was created in 1981 and has
expanded since then with the addition of several new departments and institutes, offering education in the
arts, humanities, social sciences, science and technology. The University of Nouakchott is placed under the
responsibility of the Ministry of Education, but there are a few institutes which are placed under the
responsibility of other ministries. The development of this higher education system, combined with the
training of a significant number of students in foreign universities, has generated a substantial supply of
highly skilled workers, estimated at more than 7,000 persons during the last decade. In 2000, Mauritania
had 12,912 students in higher education inside the country and another 2,439 students on scholarship
abroad. Intemational comparisons suggest that the higher education system seems over-developed in
relation to the size of the country's economy and labor market. Moreover, the supply of higher education
has insufficient professional content and lacks diversity. Only 9% of university students were enrolled in
the science and technology streams in the University of Nouakchott in 1998-99. The combined effect of
these factors lead to low external efficiency, as evidenced by the high unemployment rate among graduates,
around 30% according to the latest surveys.
Government Strategy. The Govenmment plans to revise the existing legal and institutional framework
for higher education rendering them autonomous and capable of raising funds from public and private
sources to finance the services they offer. Courses offered will be diversified and tailored to the needs
of the labor market. The quality of teaching and research will be improved by revising the content of
training courses, providing the necessary infrastructure, equipment and learning materials needed, and
promoting investment in research. Special emphasis will be placed on the promotion of teaching and
learning science and technology.
- 10-



The role of the private education system. Another factor impacting on adequate school space, is the
limited number of private learning institutions in the country. They cover only 2.5% of the total primary
and 6.5% of secondary enrollments. The development of private education has been slow, and limited for
the most part to Nouakchott and other urban centers such as Kiffa, Rosso, Nouadhibou, Timbedra and
Zoueiratt. Limited access by operators to investment funds and appropriate land for the construction of
schools, and the lack of qualified teachers have been the main reasons behind the slow development of the
private sector. Moreover, the legal framework regulating the establishment of new private institutions,
their control by the state, and their taxation regime is outdated and incomplete. Notwithstanding
affordability issues of private education, the willingness to enroll in private institutions appears to be high
in Mauritania. This is primarily because of the perceived management style and quality difference between
public and private institutions.
Government strategy. The Government strategy is to promote private education through the provision
of grants and incentives to private investors. The regulatory framework will be updated and clarified.
Other key Strategies:
The implementation of the education reform of 1999 ranks very high on the Government's social and
economic agenda. To that effect, a comprehensive policy framework and a detailed action plan has been
developed as part of the ESDP program, with clear targets for the next decade. The implementation of the
reform is being phased in one year at a time, and already covers grade 3. It will cover grade 6 in 2004/05,
grade 10 in 2007/08, and the last grade of secondary education in 2010/11. The Government has a
long-term objective to provide 10 years of universal basic education. The technical studies show that while
it is possible to achieve universal primary education, to expand significantly the first cycle of secondary
education and improve quality and equity throughout the system, a universal 10-year basic education is not
achievable during the current decade due to major capacity, financial, and human constraints.
These strategic orientations have been spelled out in the PRSP and in the ESDP documents. A letter of
sector policy (Annex 11), develops the essential policies that support these strategies which have been
discussed with IDA and various donors contributing to the ESDP. The main pillars of the education sector
strategy are as follows:
*   Government Priorities and sequencing of the reforms. The provision of 10 years of good-quality
basic education was given priority in Government investments because of its important role, pointed
out in the PRSP, in poverty reduction. Therefore, a major financial effort will be made during the next
five years in order to provide the facilities and operational budgets necessary to achieve this objective.
As a result, public investments in the second cycle of secondary education, higher education and TVT
aim essentially at improving quality and relevance, rather than expanding access. During that period,
the emphasis will be put on the diversification of training programs and improved linkages with the
labor market, with a view to expanding access when the efficiency and effectiveness of the system has
been improved. The success of this strategy depends on an effective regulation of the flow of students
in the system, which will be accomplished through the separation between the certification exams at the
end of primary and lower-secondary education (CEF and BEPC, respectively) and the access exams to
subsequent cycles. The Government has developed detailed enrollment targets at each sub-level of the
education system, based on alternative scenarios of quantitative growth and their cost implications.
*   The institutional reforms. To implement the reforms, the Government is aware of the necessity of
major institutional changes, aiming particularly at: (i) increasing participation of parents in primary
- 11 -



and general secondary education, and of the private sector in higher education and in the TVT system;
(ii) increasing accountability at all levels through careful monitoring of performance; and (iii)
reorganizing and deconcentrating the administration of the education system to improve its efficiency.
The major actions envisaged to that effect are the creation of school boards composed of
representatives of parents associations and local officials of the MEN, granting greater academic and
financial autonomy to the university of Nouakchott, the creation of consultative processes with the
private sector and demand-driven funding mechanisms in TVT, and the reinforcement of the role of the
Regional Directions of the MEN (DREN) in the process of planning and managing resources.
*   Government financing Plan. Great attention has been paid to the sustainability of the government
financial effort, with a detailed long-term financial plan worked out early in the process and approved
by the Government. The general orientations of this financing plan are as follows (i) all the recurrent
expenditures of the education system will be financed by Government budgetary resources (including
HIPC funds), while the investment effort will be shared with intemational financing partners and, to a
lesser extent, with domestic partners, particularly the communities (see below); (ii) a significant share
of the budget, up to 20% by 2005, will be allocated to non-salary expenditures to provide a permanent
allocation of funds for in-service training and maintenance activities, and for the procurement of small
equipment for the schools and the administration of the education system; and (iii) the teachers'
compensation system will be reviewed to allow moderate general salary increases, enable the allocation
of salary premiums to teachers in remote or difficult areas, and link compensation to performance.
Financial simulations of the ESDP policies suggest that the sustainability of the public expenditures on
education requires that the share of education in GDP should increase from 3.7% in 1999 to 4.7% in
2010. This can be achieved by increasing Govermment expenditures on education from 13.5% of total
revenues in 1999 to 15.5% in 2010. The major multilateral and bilateral donors have been informed
and consulted extensively on this financial plan. In order to avoid overlaps and uncoordinated
interventions, the Government and the major donors have decided to include their interventions within
the framework of the ESDP, with the assistance of a coordination mechanism which is developed in
section C4.
*   The role of Communities and of the private sector. Traditionally, the communities in Mauritania
contribute 30% to the cost of the construction of primary schools in rural areas, in a scheme that has
been in effect and operated successfully by the MEN for more than a decade. This scheme has helped
ensure better ownership of schools by conmmunities, fostered communication between the parents and
the MEN officials and better maintenance of facilities. It has also been a major ingredient in the
planning tools used by the MEN, as it allows for direct appreciation of parents' commitment and the
actual demand for education. During the implementation of the ESDP, the Government strategy will
consist in extending the role of communities to pre-schooling, by encouraging the setting-up of
community-operated programs. In primary and secondary education parents will be encouraged to
participate in school management by participating in school boards. The private education sector is
expected to play a major role, particularly at those levels of the system where the demand might exceed
the available capacity, particularly in upper-secondary, TVT and higher education. The Government
strategy consists in developing an administrative capacity in charge of monitoring the activities of the
private education sector, developing adequate legislation and procedures to regulate the sector, as well
as financial incentives to promote private investment in education. The Govemment has expressed its
determination to conduct a number of consultations during the first and second year of the program,
with the representatives of the profession, to investigate innovative financing mechanisms, including
demand-side and contract funding mechanisms, removing restrictions on private school entry and
sensitizing commercial banks to risk-taking in the education sector. A fund for the development of
- 12 -



private education will be set up after this initial consultation period, which will lead to the
determination of effective methods and detailed procedures for public support to private institutions.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The ESDP is based on a sector conceptual framework that comprises all the sub-sectors ranging from early
childhood through primary, secondary technical and vocational to higher education. The program will
address the issues discussed above, but because of the broad-spectrum of tasks to be undertaken in each
subsector, a number of strategic choices had to be made with respect to policy and operational options.
Expansion of secondary and higher education. Given the high enrollments in primary education and
the objective to increase retention rates at this level, a decision had to be made regarding the possibility
of expanding secondary and higher education accordingly or to moderate their expansion until universal
primary education had been achieved. The choice was made to moderately expand access to secondary
and higher education whilst focusing on improving internal efficiency through the enhancement of
educational quality at all levels of the system.
Availability of core textbooks in the classroom. Recent studies have shown that textbooks are a
rarity in primary classrooms due to the high costs incurred by parents and leakages in distribution
methods. Therefore, a decision had to be made on whether to distribute the books free of charge to the
schools or to let parents continue to pay for the books from the market. Given the importance of
textbooks in the learning process and the level of poverty that inhibits parents from buying the books
from the market, the Government decided to distribute the textbooks of the four core subjects at the
primary and secondary level, free of charge, to the schools which will be responsible for their
maintenance.
Duration of pre-service teacher education and supply of qualified bilingual teachers. A decision
had to be made regarding the duration of pre-service teacher education for primary teachers (one year)
and inspectors (four years). It was decided that the duration of pre-service teacher education should be
increased to two years, adding courses in bilingual and pedagogic skills necessary for effective
classroom practice. It was also decided that, due to the high costs of pre-service education for
inspectors, this program should be reduced from four to two years.
Primary scbool construction. It was decided that the community approach to school construction,
successfully used over the past five years, would be continued. This approach reduces cost and
promotes local ownership of the schools by the communities. The possibility of using contractors for
school construction was also considered, but it was rejected because of difficulties in attracting
contractors to remote rural areas and the resulting high costs.
Donor coordination. The Government of Mauritania seeks to lead and organize all donors to work in
partnership amongst themselves and with the Government towards achieving the objectives of the
reform. Mauritania receives significant support from external development partners. However, past
efforts made within the context of education projects by various development agencies have remained
largely uncoordinated and often overlap.
4. Program description and performance triggers for subsequent loans:
The national ESDP has 2 phases, lasting 4 and 5 years respectively. The APL provides support to the
ESDP in 2 phases, lasting 4 and 5 years respectively. During the first phase, more school places will be
- 13 -



provided, the implementation of the Reform in primary education will be completed, and the quality of
education will be improved. To enhance student learning, school performance enhancement programs will
be piloted, a sound institutional framework will be developed, the planning and management capacity
within the Ministry of Education at national, regional and local levels will be strengthened, and new
training modes in technical, vocational and higher education, which will be more relevant to labor market
needs will be introduced. The second or "expansion"phase will extend the implementation of the Reform to
general secondary education and scale up the pilot school performance enhancement programs. Innovation
programs introduced in the technical, vocational, and higher education systems will be expanded.
Decentralized administration will be operational following the reinforcement of the institutional and
management capacity in the regions.
Triggers for Phase 2 were chosen to measure progress towards implementing the Reform, creating an
effective management system, and strengthening the institutional environment of the education system.
Performance triggers for Phase 2 and verification means are as follows:
i. Sustained Government commitment to the ESDP. This will be verified by adequate budget
allocations to the education sector and a distribution within sub-sectors that reflects stated
priorities. The ESDP macro-financial framework (Annex 12) provides the essential data to assess
compliance with this trigger;
ii. Implementation of the Reform on schedule. By the end of Phase 1, the new curricula and
language of instruction will have been implemented in all 6 grades of primary education.
Moreover, the reform should be ready for implementation in secondary education: curricula for the
first grade of the first cycle of secondary education prepared, teachers retrained and textbooks
printed and ready for distribution before the start of the 2004-05 school year;
iii. Institutional and regulatory framework reinforced. Key aspects of this reinforcement are as
follows: (a) the grant system for the development of private education will have been put in place,
(b) a directive reinforcing the university financial and academic autonomy will have been
promulgated, (c) a national textbook publishing strategy, allowing private sector participation in
textbook publishing and distribution will have been adopted by the Government;
iv. Strengthening of the MEN management and administrative capacity completed. In terms of
structure and organization, the new organizational chart of the MEN will have been promulgated
and the regional directorates (DREN) created. In terms of management and administrative
performance, an independent study should confirm that: (a) transparent and efficient teacher and
resource allocation mechanisms exist, (b) clear work procedures and capable human resources are
available at both the central and regional level, and (c) the Direction de la Planification et de la
Cooperation (DPC) and the Direction des Affaires Administratives et Financieres (DAFM) of the
MEN are capable of performing the major project implementation responsibilities that are currently
performed by the Direction des Projets Education et Formation (DPEF) of the Ministry of
Economic Affairs and Development (MAED);
v. Phase 1 implemented successfully. Disbursement performance will have been rated satisfactory
by IDA and at least 7 performance indicators met.
vi. Program for Phase 2 ready. A detailed action plan and financing framework for Phase 2 will
have been prepared and endorsed by both the stakeholders and financing partners.
The program is structured in a way that Phase I would achieve by itself a substantial impact in terms of
reaching universal primary education, implementing the reform, and reinforcing the institutional capacity of
the education sector. Given the Government's high level of commitment to the program and the education
sector's good performance record, the probability that performance triggers will be met before the closing
date are considered high. However, in order to address implementation problems at an early stage, it was
- 14 -



agreed during project negotiations that the mid-term review will assess progress toward: (i) the
promulgation of the MEN's new organizational chart, (ii) the development of a strategy for textbook
development and distribution, and (iii) the implementation of the support grants systems to be financed by
the IDA credit.
C. Program and Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
The ESDP is a sector-wide program that consists of four major components: (i) improving the quality and
relevance of teaching-learning processes and outcomes at all levels of the education sector, (ii) promoting
greater access and regional and gender equity, especially at the primary and secondary levels, (iii)
increasing the extemal efficiency of the education system by fostering closer linkages between technical &
professional training, higher education and labor market demands, and (iv) enhancing the administrative,
technical, pedagogical, and financial management capacity of the individuals and the system as a whole.
These four sub-components are closely linked and mutually reinforcing. (See Annex 2 for details).

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
Early childhood development
The Government's strategy for ECD emphasizes the development of new community-based pre-school
programs and their reinforcement through a network of resource centers, which seek to develop ECD staff
competencies and disseminate best practices. This strategy will lean on the experience of UNICEF in this
domain and will be implemented on a pilot basis during phase 1 of the ESDP.
Primary education
The investment in school facilities will focus on adding on to existing schools where needed to provide six
grades in each school (ecoles completes) and in retrofitting older schools with water and sanitation
facilities in as many schools as possible, based on a case-by-case assessment of availability of water
resources. The proportion of schools that provide 6 grades will be increased from 35% to 59% in 2005,
and to 100% in 2010 in order to accomodate expected retained students. In sparsely populated areas this
will require an extensive use of multigrade teaching.
The investment in quality of education will focus primarily on pre-service and in-service training of
teachers to develop their capacity to operate in a truly bilingual education system. The present teaching
body consists mainly of teachers who are proficient either in Arabic or French. The number of
sufficiently bilingual teachers as well as French teachers in the system is relatively small compared to the
numbers required. Extra effort must be taken to provide intensive language training to current teachers
who have the potential of becoming bilingual, and current pre-service teacher education programs are being
revised and lengthened to include language skills training. In-service teacher courses are also being
strengthened to support the introduction of the recently developed competency-based curricula. A second
important investment in quality relates to: (i) reduction of the average class size from 50 to 36; (ii) increase
in non-salary expenditures, as a ratio of total expenditures from 15% to 20% in 2005 and 23% in 2010;
this increase will cover the minimum package of school inputs, including, materials, maintenance and
teacher training; (iii) establishment of a quality monitoring system that promotes schools' awareness of their
own performance; and (iv) focus on under-performing schools to help them develop school improvement
projects that will be implemented by their school boards. A school improvement grant system will be put in
place to finance these targeted interventions. Key features of the strategy to enhance quality in primary
- 18 -



education are developed in Annex 14.
The textbook production and delivery systems will be subject to a new set of policies consisting in: (i)
organizing the free distribution in primary education of a set of 4 essential free textbooks per student for
classroom use, (ii) implementing a policy of small school libraries, and (iii) liberalizing textbook
development and distribution, with gradual involvement of the private sector in both publishing and
distribution. A national textbook publishing policy will be developed before the end of 2003 and will be
implemented before the end of phase 1 of the ESDP.
Secondary education
The transition rate from primary to secondary will remain unchanged at 50%. As a result of the expected
increase of the retention rate of primary education, the number of new students accessing secondary
education will increase steadily from 18,300 at present to 35,000 in 2010. In order to promote the access
of girls and students from rural areas, the Government is committed to building small-scale colleges in
small and medium-size towns, and to draw rural students to these colleges by encouraging communities
and parents to develop and operate appropriate accommodations. As regards the second cycle of secondary
education, the number of students will stabilize at around 14,500, which will enable the implementation of
proposed quality-enhancing measures.
The quality of secondary education will be enhanced through: (i) the renovation of the curricula, with
greater emphasis on science education and on foreign languages, (ii) the development of in-service training
programs to accompany the language and curricula reform, (iii) the provision of textbooks and laboratory
equipment, and (iv) the reduction of the average class-size from 50 to 37 in lower-secondary, and from 42
to 38 in upper-secondary. These measures are expected to enable a reduction of repetition rates from 13%
to 11% in 2005, for the first cycle, and from 12% to 6%, for the second cycle. Key features of the
Government strategy to enhance quality in secondary education are developed in Annex 14.
To address the gap between girls and boys, which is still significant nationwide, the Government has
signed a cooperation agreement with several UTN organizations (UNICEF, VNDP, UNFPA and WFP) to
conduct a pilot program in the regions of Assaba, Brakna, le Gorgol and the Guidimagha. The purpose of
this program is to determine a model of intervention, including the provision of appropriate accommodation
and the implementation of information campaigns, that will be extended nationwide in 3 years, once the
pilot phase is completed.
Technical and Vocational Training
In the TVT sub-sector, the Government's objective is to successfully adapt the training system to the
specific qualitative and quantitative needs of all production sectors, including the informal and service
sectors of the economy. This will be achieved through the implementation of institutional reforms that aim
at making the provision of TVT demand-driven. The main aspects of the reform are: (i) establishment of a
new autonomous institution, the INP-FTP, with a bipartite board, which will have broad responsibilities
over the coordination of TVT activities, the provision of technical support to the training institutions to
adapt their training supply and the financing of new demand-driven training activities; (ii) improvement of
the quality and availability of information on skill requirements of enterprises; (iii) analyses of the major
trends in the evolution of the content and needs of qualifications; (iv) development of more flexible training
modes, based primarily on apprenticeship and school-to-job schemes; (v) monitoring of the insertion of
graduates to jobs; and (vi) the development of school financing and management mechanisms based on
- 19-



performance. Given that these reforms require an in-depth reorganization of the institutional framework,
they will be phased in gradually, on the basis of a pilot project in a limited numnber of sectors, which will be
taken to scale in the second phase of the program.
Higher Education
In higher education, the Government strategy consists of the following points: (i) renovation of the
institutional framework which reinforces the autonomy of the institutions while creating a strong planning,
monitoring and coordination mechanism in the MEN; (ii) diversification of the supply of training,
enhancement of the job-related content of university courses, particularly that of short (2-3 years)
diplomas; (iii) improvement of the quality of teaching and learning; (iv) rationalization of the sector
expenditures, especially through a gradual reduction of expenditures on scholarships and their replacement
by pedagogical activities; (v) reinforcement of the teaching and research capacity by promoting staff
exchanges with foreign universities, providing incentives and funding for applied research, and promoting
the use of the new information technologies; and (vi) the reduction of the student teacher ratios from 31 to
14 in 2010. These objectives will be reached over a decade, with the first phase being dedicated to the
institutional changes, the adaptation of the legal framework, and the piloting of new professionally-oriented
training courses. The Government also envisages the construction of a new integrated campus in
Nouakchott, including teaching facilities, a central library, a university restaurant and accommnodations for
students to be operated by the private sector under contract with the university and to rehabilitate and equip
the science and technology institute in Rosso. These investments aim to create an adequate environment for
teaching, research as well as other aspects of university life. The successful implementation of this plan
requires that during this transition period the intake of new students be limited to 2,600 a year, and the total
number of students to about 7,500.
Literacy
'The Government seeks to: (i) achieve greater complementarity between the formal education system and
the traditional system (Mahadras), and (ii) promote functional literacy through a new type of adult literacy
program. To allow the Mahadras system to contribute fully to the national education goals, the
Govermment will put in place an incentive system enabling the Mahadras to benefit from State funding and
pedagogical support if they commit to complement their teaching with subjects that will help their students
move to the formal education system, if they desire to do so. The Government will also promote the
provision of functional literacy and non-formal education programs for adults and unschooled and
out-of-school youth to be implemented by outsourcing of program development and delivery to NGOs and
other components of the civil society.
School health
A variety of actions aimed at enhancing the health of school-aged children will be implemented on a pilot
basis, including the emphasis on hygiene, the construction of latrines, provision of drinking water,
dewormiing and the distribution of micro-nutrients to eradicate the deficiencies in iodine, iron, and vitamin
A in several affected areas that have been identified in health surveys.
Management and Administration
The reinforcement of the MEN capacity to plan and manage education development is one of the most
important project objectives. A concrete preparatory step has already been taken through the completion of
an audit of the MEN structure and organization. This audit provided a detailed assessment of the
- 20 -



structural and organizational deficiencies of the MEN and helped develop a reorganization plan through a
participative process involving all staff. The main structural actions that will be undertaken to reinforce
the institutional capacity of the MEN are as follows: (i) revision of the MEN organizational chart at the
central level, (ii) creation of Regional Directorates (DREN) to deconcentrate the central administration and
clarification of the responsibilities at each level, (iii) appointment at the central and regional levels of
qualified managers on the basis ofjob profiles and competencies that will be defined prior to recruitment,
and (iv) improved coordination mechanisms between the ministries of education, health, vocational training
and other ministries involved in vocational training through formnal administrative links and coordination
arrangements. In addition, the organizational audit will be extended to the Institut Pedagogique National
(IPN), which is under the responsibility of the MEN. These activities will be implemented over the first
phase and, when completed, will provide the MEN with a coherent structure, strong institutional capacities,
and clear procedures.
As a result of the actions above, the MEN's administrative and management performance should improve
significantly during Phase 1. One key result will be to narrow the differences in resource allocation among
regions by rationalizing expenditures. Teacher deployment is especially targeted by this process and will
henceforth be: (i) performed by clearly designated officials who will be accountable for its results at the
central and regional level; (ii) based on a simple set of criteria; and (iii) limited in time to the summer
vacation period. To facilitate appointments in the remote areas, which have a very high teacher turnover
rate, significant incentives will be provided, including a salary premium of 15% that could benefit as many
as 35% of the teachers. The successful policies and activities to promote girls' education will be continued,
aiming at a few provinces where girls' enrollment is still lagging behind that of boys in primary education.
It is expected that these measures will substantially enhance equity throughout the system.
Particular attention will be paid to perfornance monitoring at the level of the schools. This will be
achieved both through the traditional functions of inspectors and school directors, who will be trained and
provided with adequate communication means, and through a more efficient monitoring system that enables
the collection and dissemination of assessment results on a continuous and comparable bases. The
Government will also encourage the development of parents' associations to reinforce the accountability of
the schools vis-a-vis their stakeholders.
Human resource management will be enhanced by a better monitoring of careers, the introduction of a
performance-based merit system, and the provision of incentives to encourage the conversion of Arabic
teachers to bilingual teachers, which provides much needed flexibility in the staffing of smaller schools.
3. Benefits and target population:
Benefits:
The program will benefit approximately one million primary, secondary, technical and vocational and
higher education students over a period of ten years. Primary and secondary school students will have
access to more places in better school facilities, improved supply of learning materials and better teaching
methods. The number of primary school children projected to be admnitted into grade 1 will increase by
about 48% from 66,275 in 1998 to 98,427 in 2010. Within the same period, the number of students
admitted into first grade of first cycle secondary will almost double from 18,344 to 35,000. Approximately
13,650 primary and 3,749 secondary teachers will also benefit from increased pedagogic support and
training. Overall program outcomes are linked to Mauritania's poverty reduction strategy, which highlights
the development of human resources and access to essential infrastructure as one of its main themes. The
Government program is expected to have the following impacts:
- 21 -



Economic - Improved quality of life. Improved access, equity and quality of schooling will result in
increased enrollment in primary and the first cycle of secondary education and in higher completion rates.
Graduates will be better prepared in general life skills, including improved health practices. Vocational and
technical education trainees will demonstrate improved entrepreneurial skills which will enhance
productivity, labor market mobility, employment prospects, an increase in lifetime eamings, and economic
growth. The quality of life, particularly for girls, will be improved through the reduction of fertility,
maternal and infant mortality rates. Improved nutrition and health standards will increase the likelihood for
children of beneficiaries to receive better education.
Social - Reduced inequalities. The provision of school places and adequate learning materials will
increase access and, in particular, benefit children in rural, poor, and disadvantaged areas, thereby reducing
inherent imbalances in educational provision in the country. Girls will also benefit from a gender-sensitive
strategy applied to all areas of educational provision. By targeting training and development needs of
youth and workers through the technical and vocational training system, the program will increase
productivity in the labor market. This will in turn improve equity, reduce social tensions linked to
unemployment, and contribute to the alleviation of urban poverty.
Institutional - Improved service delivery. The program will strengthen the key strategic functions of the
Ministry of Education and put in place efficient procedures for the allocation and use of financial and
human resources. The Government will administer public education more efficiently while encouraging
privately provided and financed educational institutions as well. The decentralization of education
management from the center to the regions and districts will lead to more effective delivery of educational
services, in which communities, local providers, and parents will be more involved.
Target population:
The program will target: (a) pre-school children aged 5 and under; (b) children presently in primary
schools receiving poor quality education; (c) out-of-school children of school-going age, particularly girls
and children in poor rural and disadvantaged areas, who will have better educational opportunities;
(d) students at the secondary level who have access to quality education that prepares them for a productive
professional future; (e) teachers who will benefit from training and increased professionalism; (f) adults
and drop-outs who will participate in and benefit from literacy programs; (g) youth between the ages of 15
and 25 whose skills will be improved through technical and vocational education and whose productivity in
the labor market will increase; (h) students in higher education who will be adequately prepared for medium
and high-level professions in the labor market; (i) staff of the Ministry of Education at the central,
provincial and district levels; and (j) school directors, teachers and communities who will become more
involved in the decision-making process regarding improvements at the school level.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation Period: The program is to be implemented over a nine-year period in two phases:
2002-06 and 2006-10.
Implementing Agencies: MEN, the Secretariat d'Etat d la Condition Feminine (SECF), and the
Secretariat d'Etat a l 'Alphabetisation et a l'Enseignement Originel (SEAEO).
Guiding Principles: The ESDP is a sector program implemented by the MEN and two State Secretariats,
with the MEAD playing the coordination role. It encompasses all MEN activities. ESDP implementation
- 22 -



will be based on annual Action Plans and Budgets (APB). Strong donor coordination through joint reviews
will ensure that execution of each donor "project" is consistent with the ESDP. This donor coordination
will lead to a more complete integration of support during Phase 2, where the goal is to implement a
SWAP. Phase 1 of the APL will focus on building MEN management capacity.
Overall implementation arrangements: The MEN will handle primary, secondary, and higher education
and play a coordinating role in vocational training activities between all private and public providers and
beneficiaries. The SECF will take responsibility for Early Childhood Development and the SEAEO will
manage literacy. Each component or sub-component will be implemented by the appropriate Directorate
(see Annex 2). Financial and procurement tasks will be handled by the DPEF within the MAED in Phase 1
and by MEN in Phase 2. The sharing of implementation responsibilities between the MEN and the DPEF
during phase 1 is spelled out in detail in the Letter of Sector Policy (Annex 11).
Coordination of ESDP implementation:
Program Coordination Committee (PCC). The PCC will coordinate implementation of the ESDP,
meeting at least twice a year. After preparation of draft APBs by component/sub-component, and
consolidation / arbitration by the PMC, the PCC will review the overall APB for submission to the
Ministers and donors. The PCC will also monitor perfornance and meet the donors during joint annual
reviews. The PCC will include all central and regional MEN directors; directors of institutions such as
IPN, ENS, and the University; the director in charge of Early Childhood Development in the SECF; the
directors in charge of Literacy and the Mahadras in the SEAEO; the directors of contract management
agencies such as AMEXTIPE and the DH (Direction de l'Hydraulique); private sector
representatives; the director of the budget in the MF and the Directeur de la Programmation et des
Etudes in the MAED; and the director of the Collectivites Locales in the Ministry of Interior.
Program Management Committee (PMC). During Phase 1, the PMC will be composed of the DPC
of the MEN and the DPEF of the MEAD. The DPC is responsible for coordination of MEN
Directorates both intemally and with other Ministries and donors. The DPEF is responsible for extemal
resources and national counterpart funds required under foreign credit and grant agreements.
The Action Plan and Budget (APB) Process
The annual APB is the implementation mechanism for the ESDP, helping the sector to monitor
progress and implement corrective measures:
a. each component manager will review implementation of the previous APB and transmit a new
draft APB to the PMC, after stakeholder consultation;
b. the PMC will (i) prepare a consolidated APB monitoring report and (ii) consolidate all
individual draft APBs into an annual sector-wide APB with adjustments based on financial
resources available;
c. the PCC will assess ESDP performance and validate the proposed APB for the following year;
d. the assessment report and the new APB will be submitted to donors for conunents during the
annual joint review;
e. the MAED, MEN, SECF, MSAS and SEAEO will approve the new APB;
f. the PMC will monitor implementation and ensure coordination with extemal partners. It will
also prepare a mid-term APB review by the PCC.
- 23 -



The following criteria will guide the assessment by the PMC of the annual APB: (i) consistency with
ESDP objectives; (ii) consistency of implementation strategies with the Letter of Sector Policy; (iii)
consistency of student flows for each sub-sector with the macro-financial framework, (iv) consistency
with the ESDP macro-financial framework; (v) consistency with external partner agreements; (vi)
consistency between expenditures to be financed by other internal partners (parents, the private sector,
local communities) and input received from these partners.
Building MEN management capacity. During Phase 1, plarning responsibilities will be handled by MEN
and financial and procurement responsibilities by the DPEF while capacity is built in the relevant MEN
directorates. MEN capacity building will be completed by the end of Phase 1 and MEN will be able to
handle all of its financial and procurement responsibilities under both national and external financing. In
particular, the DPC and DAFM will be able to handle the project implementation responsibilities that are
currently performed by the DPEF.
Financial and disbursement arrangements:
The PMC will prepare the budgets. During the first phase of the program, all donors will make
disbursements within the ESDP framework but under separate credit or grant agreements with the (see
Manuel de Procedures Administratives, Financieres et Comptables):
a. expenditures financed by the budget will be managed according to national guidelines;
b. expenditures financed by some international donors, including IDA and AfDB, will be managed by
the DPEF. This directorate has a strong capacity for the management of such funds and sound
knowledge of donor financial procedures. It will manage, inter alia, the AfDB and IDA special
accounts.
c. expenditures for some bilateral donors, UN agencies and NGOs will be managed by the
organization itself.
Financial responsibility of the DPEF during Phase I of ESDP
During Phase 1, the financial responsibilities of the DPEF will be to: (a) implement the financial MIS,
designed around the APB process; (b) carry out budget planning in relation with donor support, including
coordination of the APB process, for presentation to the MF and development partners; (c) prepare monthly
applications for replenishments of Special Accounts or direct payments by IDA and AfDB and similar
mechanisms for special accounts of other donors; (d) ensure the initial deposit and annual replenishment of
Project Accounts from the BCI for donor-financed projects, including IDA; (e) execute expenditures from
Special Accounts and Project Accounts; (f) monitor expenditures of donors and autonomous institutions
such as the universities; (g) oversee management of construction by AMEXTIPE; (h) maintain and
consolidate all ESDP program accounts, including IDA Special Accounts and special accounts of other
donors; (i) monitor compliance with the Manual of Accounting and Financial Procedures; (j) ensure that
audits are submitted three months prior to annual reviews; (k) coordinate the preparation of quarterly
Program Management Reports (PMR); and (1) prepare the overall financial report for the ESDP, verify its
consistency with the initial financial framework for the ESDP, identify gaps and propose remedies.
Procurement arrangements:
During Phase 1, procurement arrangements will be consistent with the relevant financing agreements with
- 24 -



donors. Arrangements are summarized as follows:
a. procurement of goods and services financed under the recurrent budget will be consistent with
national procurement procedures;
b. procurement of goods and services financed by the Investment Budget (BCI) and by international
donors will be carried out by the DPEF as per agreements with donors;
c. procurement of works - with the exception of primary school construction and wells -- financed by
the Government and external donors will be delegated to AMEXTIPE, for smaller contracts in
Nouakchott and the other towns;
d. procurement of works and goods for primary school construction by the Government, AfDB and
IDA will be delegated by the DPEF to communities, while works for drilling and equipment of
wells will be delegated to DH;
e. procurement of goods, works and services financed by UN agencies, bilaterals and NGOs will be
managed by the organization itself.
A participatory procurement capacity assessment was conducted during program preparation (see Annex 6)
and its results were incorporated into the project.
Donor coordination:
Extemal support is project-based with the ESDP framework. Under DPC-DPEF coordination, the
Government, AfDB, and IDA conducted joint preparation missions, in close collaboration with the French
Cooperation. Preparation of the Mahadras component was also prepared in close collaboration with
UNICEF. With IDB, these 4 donors account for 98% of the external support to ESDP. All ESDP external
partners will be invited by the PMC to jointly participate in annual APB reviews. A draft memorandum of
understanding is under discussion by the donors to be signed at project launch.
Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements:
ESDP's performances will be monitored with a set of key indicators which are provided by the ESDP
logframe in Annex 1. The PMC will prepare an initial Action Plan and Budget for SY 2001-02 which will
be jointly reviewed in December 2001 during the Launching Workshop which will coincide with the first
joint ESDP Annual Review. ESDP indicators will be broken down by school year and the first set will be
included in the first APB for 2001-02. Subsequent annual Action Plans and Budgets will be prepared for
joint review by the Government and donors in September of each year. During the reviews, the
Govemment and donors will review the progress on the basis of the performance indicators for the relevant
year.
Performance indicators for each component and sub-component will be incorporated into the relevant
modules of the Program Implementation Plan (PIP) to monitor the progress of the various
componentlsub-component in terms of inputs, processes and outputs. The PIP also describes arrangements
and responsibilities for component-level monitoring, reporting and evaluation. The information will be
incorporated into the Education Management Information System (EMIS) to be developed under the
program.
Quarterly program implementation reports carried out by the DPEF will provide accounting and financial
information on the program, including procurement activities and physical progress. An integrated FMIS
will be developed under the program.

Implementation capacity:
Smooth implementation will necessitate considerable capacity building in all directorates, especially
regarding the implementation of the reform from Arabic mono-language to Arabic-French bilingual
teaching/learning. In parallel, management capacity building of the MEN is needed for the transfer of full
management responsibilities from MEAD to MEN. Capacity building interventions have been designed on
the basis of: (i) recommendations from the Institutional Audit conducted during the previous project
Education V; and (ii) capacity needs assessment conducted during project preparation whose results are
reflected in the PIP and the COSTAB. These capacity building interventions will be multi-pronged and
include:
a. redefinition of the Terms of Reference of each Directorate and Institution and their managers and
key staff, on the basis of the responsibilities listed in the PIP;
b. adoption of a new MEN organization on the basis of the above mentioned redefinition, including
the creation of a DRH (Direction des Ressources Humaines), and issuance of all related
documents (dcrets and arrit6s);
c. recruitment of new staff (on Government budget) in the DPC and DAFM with adequate skills to
address MEN needs for professional capacity in planning, economic analysis, financial analysis,
personnel management, budgeting, financial and accounting management, and procurement;
d. training of the new staff-- expected to be hired with adequate academic background but probably
limited professional experience -- to enable them to perform their responsibilities. Part of this
training will be provided by proficient long-term technical assistance recruited under contracts
specifying their clear skill-transfer mandate including benchmarks and performance indicators for
this transfer;
e. provision of equipment, tools, and facilities needed by the implementing agencies (DPEF, DPC DP,
DAFM) to carry out their roles and functions under the program.
D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The Government of Mauritania and IDA discussed the option of conventional lending versus an APL,
combined with a sector-wide approach (SWAP) to support the ESDP. The ESDP has essentially been
prepared as a sector-wide program, and the Govemment has announced that donor contributions are
expected to take place within the ESDP framework. However, while recognizing the potential benefits of a
SWAP, the Mauritanian Government had mixed feelings about the seemingly complex coordination and
management procedures that a SWAP entails. A SWAP is currently being implemented in the health sector
in Mauritania and has been disbursing too slowly. Moreover, the MEN's current capacity for strategic
planning, programning and monitoring of public expenditures does not allow for effective donor
coordination. For this to happen, there would need to be: (i) a national system of financial management
and procurement that are demonstrably economical and efficient; and (ii) a willingness of all major
partners to shift from project aid to budget support.
An in-depth discussion of the potential benefits and disadvantages of a SWAP approach in the education
sector has led to the development of arrangements that are appropriate for the current situation in
Mauritania. These arrangements consist in keeping donor contributions independent and under separate
agreements during Phase 1, while maintaining overall coherence by focussing all financial assistance on the
achievement of the ESDP objectives as spelled out in the letter of sectoral policy (Annex 1 1), the 10 year
macro-financial framework (Annex 12) and the implementation and monitoring arrangements (Section C
- 26 -



above). In particular, the monitoring arrangements seek to increase the efficiency and coherence of donor
financial support through the implementation of Annual Budget Plans and joint reviews. At the same time,
the donors agree to firther integrate their financial support during phase 2, when the MEN planning,
financial management and procurement capacities are fully developed.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Lesson 1: Past projects have been limited to sub-sectors where each donor chose what to finance and
improvements were isolated and piecemeal. The Government needs to develop a comprehensive and
coherent strategy for the education sector with coordinated donor interventions.
Response: The Government has developed a coherent strategy for the entire education sector,
undertaken an economic analysis, and estimated the cost of implementing the strategy within the
country's macroeconomic framework. Joint annual reviews of program implementation by the
Government and donors have been included as part of the Government's effort to ensure donor
coordination in the education sector.
Lesson 2: Institutional capacity development in the Ministry of Education has been slow and limited partly
because it has been based on the narrow concept of borrowing skills through technical assistance and
training. Long-term technical assistance experts were often under-utilized and there were no clear plans to
ensure the transfer of knowledge to their Mauritanian counterparts. Training was often ad hoc and not
based on a coherent strategy for sector improvement.
Response: The proposed program addresses these issues by taking a broader, more holistic and
operational perspective of capacity building. It will deal with all the elements of institutional capacity
such as organization, planning, administration, financial, human and material resource improvement
and management. The program will depend on the existing management capacity of the project
coordination unit in the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development during the first phase, while
the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education is being strengthened. The technical capacity of
staff at the central, regional and district levels of the Ministry of Education will be developed, and
dependence on extemal technical assistance will then be limited to specific areas of high-level expertise.
Lesson 3: Efficient service delivery and improvements in the quality of the teaching and learning process
depend on management structures that are closer to the schools and an empowered teaching force.
Previous projects have not paid sufficient attention to the decentralization of educational management and
planning or to the empowerment of teachers and school directors to take full responsibility for the
educational outcomes of their schools.
Response: The current program design draws on deconcentration experiences from neighboring
countries, such as Guinea, Senegal and Mali, which have clearly defined the roles of regional and
district structures. It seeks to develop a good education information and management system (EMIS)
and a functional monitoring capacity at all levels. The program will support a pilot school
improvement initiative with the aim of developing management capacity at the school level. The roles
of inspectors in in-service teacher training will be redefined so that they respond to teacher-driven
training initiatives that the program will support.
Lesson 4: The textbook sales approach and the book distribution methods used in past projects, have left
many children, particularly those of the poor, without textbooks. This has seriously impeded effective
- 28 -



teaching and learning in schools and has been one of the causes of internal inefficiency.
Response: The proposed program is designed to ensure that all children at the primary level receive a
set of textbooks in the core subjects. The textbook policy and distribution system will be revised and
schools will be responsible for taking care of the books. Schools will be provided with other didactic
materials that will enhance the teaching and learning process. Teachers will receive sufficient training
in the development of new ways of responding to the wide range of pupils' learning needs.
Lesson 5: The effectiveness of community participation in primary school construction has been
demonstrated in past projects. The approach has promoted local ownership of schools and has encouraged
community financing.
Response: The current program is designed to continue support for community participation in
primary school construction while simplifying the long and tedious bureaucratic procedures for
obtaining financing. The program will also encourage community involvement in decision-making and
the local management of schools through school boards and parent teacher associations.
Lesson 6: Private sector provision of education has been weak at the primary and secondary levels and
does not exist at the level of higher education. Private financing and provision of technical and vocational
education have been limited. For the Government to attain the educational goals it has set, it will need to
stimulate the development of private sector provision and financing for general, technical and vocational
education.
Response: The program is designed to make available a support fimd for the development of private
primary and secondary education in order to attain the objectives of the education sector program. A
training support fund will also be established to fund skills-acquisition programs and improve the
planning and management of technical education and vocational training centers. Links will be
established with employers and information about labor market demand and employment trends will be
collected regularly.
4. indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Government commitment and ownership has been very strong as demonstrated below:
*  Education is a high priority sector in the national development agenda as indicated by political
pronouncements and budgetary allocations. The proportion of the national recurrent budget
allocated to education will increase from 13.5% to 14.9% in 2005 and 15.5% in 2010. The
Government is committed to meeting these targets and has taken the proactive step of setting up
arrangements for annual monitoring with donors.
*  The ten-year education sector development program and an implementation plan supported by a
rigorous economic analysis were prepared within twelve months, mostly by Mauritanians. The
quality of the project documents produced, along with the decision to appoint young professionals
with the necessary technical expertise to head the directorates of the Ministry of Education, also
shows an ownership of the project that matches the political determination to modernize the
education sector.
*  The Government is committed to implementing tough policy decisions such as limiting the number
of students in the university and focusing on the improvement of quality and increased scientific
research. It also seeks to increase cost recovery and private financing of higher education.

5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The Bank's knowledge of educational issues in national contexts all over the world, as well as earlier and
current involvement in the education sector in Mauritania make its support to this prograrn highly valuable
to the Government of Mauritania. During program preparation, the Bank provided technical advice on
educational, financial and management issues to the national team. Specifically, Bank support helped in
bringing ideas and experiences from other countries to bear on discussions of policies and strategies. The
Bank is considered to have added value to enhancing the quality of the documents developed, particularly in
its emphasis on preparing a logical framework with key performance and monitoring indicators at the
beginning of program document preparation. The Bank also played a major role in ensuring that a coherent
program with an adequate implementation framework was established.
Throughout program implementation the Bank will play a key role in providing technical advice during
program supervision missions. The Bank will also provide long-term financial support through a
two-phase adaptable program loan (APL) which is particularly valuable given the fiscal constraints and in
light of the major investments needed to achieve the development goals of the sector.
E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
O Cost benefit    NPV=USS million; ERR = % (see Annex 4)
* Cost effectiveness
O Other (specify)
The sector study (Le systeme educatif-mauritanien: elements d 'analyse pour instruire des politiques
nouvelles, May 2000) carried out a number of cost-effectiveness analyses to better understand the
relations between school organization structure, availability of educational inputs, and performance of
schools. The study was conducted on a sample 429 schools, from a total number of 2,656 schools. The
sample included a large variety of situations in terms of school endowment, pedagogic organization and
academic performance, enabling the analysis of the relation between several key factors. School
performance was measured by results in the primary education completion exam (CEF). The average
pass rate in the CEF was 37% on average in the sample, with a very high standard deviation (26%).
Analyzing the effect of class-size, student-teacher ratio, single/multi- grade teaching and double shifts, it
appears that double shifting has negative impact on the success rate in the CEF, while multigrade
teaching has no noticeable impact on school performance. On the other hand, both the high student per
teacher ratio and large class size are associated with lower school performance. The average class size
was 47.4 (with a standard deviation of 21) and the average student per teacher ratio was 51.8 (standard
deviation 25) which are both relatively high. A increase of 10 students per class is associated with a 3%
decrease in the pass rate of the CEF exam. Anther noticeable result was the apparent weak impact of
teachers' formal qualifications. The teacher body is very diverse. About 90% of teachers are fully
qualified, 9% partially qualified (instituteurs adjoints) and 1% have no formal qualification. However,
in some schools as many as 20% of the teachers are either partially qualified or unqualified. The
percentage of the variance suggests that the composition of the teacher body had only a marginal effect
on school performance.
Similarly, the examination of the availability of teaching-learning materials and other desirable
characteristics of the school environment show interesting results. It is important to mention that the
school database contains information only on the existence of small school materials (such as a ruler or a
- 30 -



box of small weights), as well as the existence of facilities such as latrines, canteens and playground.
With regard to the availability of small pedagogic materials, only the best endowed schools have
significantly better results. These schools represent 14% of the sample, while 60% of the schools in the
sample have no pedagogic materials at all. Similarly, the results are positively correlated with the
condition of the school building, i.e., the existence of a canteen, water and other facilities. Due to
extreme shortages, textbooks were not part of the package of teaching and learning materials that was
considered. However, separate analyses showed that the existence of textbooks and teacher guides
produce a significant improvement in results.
Despite many data limitations, this analysis draws attention to a few interesting facts. First, many of the
findings are coherent with established research findings. Second, they tend to support the strategies and
policies of the ESDP, particularly the emphasis on teacher in-service training to enhance their language
capability, the provision of pedagogic materials, the retrofitting of schools with latrines and water, the
planned slight decrease of average class size and teacher per student ratios, the use of multigrade
classes, the limited recourse to double shifting and the emphasis on school maintenance.
2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
NPV=US$ million; FRR = % (see Annex 4)
Fiscal Impact:
Detailed projections of expenditures and sources of financing for the 10-year education program were
produced by the Government and are found in Annex 12. These analyses show that, based on widely
accepted assumptions for GDP and revenue growth, the fiscal impact of the ESDP is relatively modest in
comparison with its expected benefits. Key aspects of the financial simulations show that:
* The Government will provide 62% of ESDP expenditures, corresponding to the majority of
operational expenditures in the sector.
*  To adequately fund the ESDP program the Government will need to increase MEN operational
budget from 13.5% of total state revenues to 14.4% and 15.5% in 2005 and 2010, respectively.
Total education sector expenditures, including expenditures by ministries other than MEN, will
increase to 14.9% and 16.8% during the same period.
*  Intra-sectoral allocations will also need to change in percentage of the MEN's budget: the share
allocated to primary will increase from the current 46% to 52%, because of the priority given to
this level, the need to recruit additional teachers and the emphasis on providing teachers and
students with adequate teaching and learning resources. The share of the first cycle of primary
education will also increase from 15% to 19%. However, following the decision to rationalize
access to the second cycle of secondary education and to higher education, and to emphasize
quality and effectiveness over quantity, the share of second cycle secondary education and higher
education in the total education budget will decline from 13% and 18% to 12% and 10%,
respectively, in 2010.
3. Technical:
The program design is appropriate to the needs of the country. Proposed activities are related to
findings from a recent sector study which highlights the main characteristics of the education
system. The major issues identified include limited and inequitable access to primary and secondary
education resulting mostly from supply constraints, poor quality and low intemal efficiency (high
repetition and dropout rates), low institutional capacity for systems management, mninimally
responsive technical and vocational education, inefficient higher education, inadequate funding and
- 31 -



sub-optimal allocation of resources particularly at the school level.
Program objectives and performance targets are based on projections of a simulation model using
assumptions regarding enrollment and repetition rates as well as pupil teacher ratios. An analysis
of the overall level of recurrent costs, including the incremental costs and savings produced by the
program for example when repetition rates are reduced in primary from the current 15% to 7%, and
in secondary from 7% to 3% by 2010, indicates that the program will cost approximately US$320
million. This will be financially viable when the national budget is supplemented by external funds.
Estimates for investment costs are based on current market rates and allowances for physical
contingencies and price increases during implementation have been adequately accounted for.
Technically, program activities conform to educational principles and draws from lessons learnt in
past projects and from sound educational practice elsewhere. The strategies envisaged include:
School construction: To attain universal primary education by 2005 while admitting
approximately 85,000 pupils in the first grade of primary education and ensuring that 78% of them
complete the primary cycle, the Government has decided to ensure that all primary schools provide
a complete cycle by 2010. This will involve the construction of new classrooms and the use of
multigrade teaching especially in the rural areas.
Demand and supply of trained teachers: The Ministry of Education recognizes the constraint of
recruiting sufficient numbers of candidates who meet the requirements for bilingual pre-service
teacher training. It has decided to embark on a two-pronged approach. First, the existing one-year
pre-service teacher education will be increased to two years. The first year of training will be
devoted to language skills and the second year partly to pedagogic matters and supervised teaching
practice in the schools. Second, the existing corps of teachers will be categorized into two groups -
those who have the capability of being bilingual and those who do not. The former group will
undergo intensive language training and the latter will continue as monolingual teachers in the
schools. In addition, the ESDP also emphasizes a dynamic teacher support system where there will
be links between pre-service and in-service teacher training, regular teacher seminars and
pedagogical support to schools from the inspectors.
Pedagogical materials: Presently, the Govenmment relies on the national pedagogical institute
(IPN) for the development and printing of textbooks. The planned transition from state monopoly
to competition in publishing will be phased in gradually within the first phase of the program. The
issue of textbook procurement and distribution has been long-standing and complicated. The
existing policy of cost-recovery for primary school textbooks has seriously limited their availability
in the classroom. The Government has decided to provide free textbooks to students in primary and
secondary schools and to implement a carefully planned transition program to privatization.
Decentralized management of schools: The Government has decided to create regional and
district management structures that will respond faster to the demand and supply issues of the
schools. The program will also support the development of a school improvement model that will
ensure quality and relevance of schooling.
Lengthening of first cycle of secondary education: According to the recent educational reform,
the length of the first cycle of secondary education will be increased from three to four years to
better prepare students for studies either in the second cycle of general education, technical and
vocational education or employment.
- 32 -



Responsiveness of technical and vocational education to labor market needs: The management
of technical and vocational education will be restructured; the quality will be improved and linked
directly to the needs of the labor market. Provision of technical and vocational education will be
expanded to the regions.
External efficiency of higher education: The Government has taken special measures to improve
the performance of higher education by putting in place an institutional framework that increases
the autonomy of higher education institutions and investing in scientific courses and research that
are adapted to the labor market.
4. Institutional:
The choice between a sector approach vs. project approach, which is discussed in section Dl, will have an
important impact on the borrower's capacity to carry out project implemnentation, as well as on the
effectiveness of the cooperation between the Government and its financial partners. An approach based on
the aggregate of individual donor projects combined with strong sector-based management tools such as
APBs and donor coordination was selected to allow the Government to apply its strong capacity in
individual project management while strengthening its sector-based management procedures, and is the
most appropriate choice in order to ensure successful implementation.
4.1 Executing agencies:
The executing agencies are listed in para. C4.
4.2 Project management:
During phase 1 of the ESDP, the program management will be under the responsibility of the (DPEF)
within the MAED. For 25 years the management of education projects has been under the responsibility of
the DPEF, an ad hoc PIU under the responsibility of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development
(MAED). The DPEF has a good performance record in project implementation, including procurement and
financial management. Both MEN and MAED have expressed their satisfaction with the current
arrangement because it compensates for MEN's weak management capacity, and wished to keep it
unchanged during phase 1, while MEN's capacity is being built up. Both the MEN and the MAED agree
to phase out the DPEF during phase 2 of the ESDP, when the MEN's management capacity is expected to
allow the management of complex operations.
4.3 Procurement issues:
The national procurement code, and public procurement monitoring is being improved on the basis of the
1999 CPAR with support of an IDF grant. A participatory procurement capacity assessment of the
various agencies involved in procurement (DPEF, DAFM, AMEXTIPE and Communities) conducted
during preparation concluded that the overall risk is average. The DPEF, which has extensive experience
and a good track record, will carry out the main bulk of procurement for goods and services while
construction will be delegated to AMEXITIPE for collges and office buildings, and to communities for
primary schools. An action plan has been deternined for enhancing DPEF procurement capacity to enable
it handle the ESDP workload (see Annex 6). AMEXTIPE procurement capacity will be enhanced under
the parallel Urban Development Project. Procurement capacity of the DAFM is extremely weak. During
the first phase of ESDP, this Directorate will have procurement activities limited to contracts financed by
Government through the MEN's operating budget while full procurement capacity will be built with a view
to transferring DPEF procurement responsibilities in the second phase. Communities have already full
capacity to implement the community-based primary school building program (with DPEF technical
- 33 -



support) as evidenced by its performance record in the implementation of similar programs over the past
ten years.
4.4 Financial management issues:
During the first phase of the ESDP, the DPEF will handle financial management and will maintain the
books and accounts. It will also be responsible for the production of the annual financial statements. The
DPEF have a satisfactory financial and accounting unit, which has gained vast experience in IDA
procedures during previous projects (the General Education Project and the Vocational Training Project).
However, this unit will be reinforced with better computer equipment, a revised procedures manual, and
training. Building financial capacity of the DAFM will be one of the main objectives of the ESDP to allow
DAFM to handle ESDP financial responsibilities by phase 2.
5. Environmental:                 Environmental Category: C (Not Required)
5.1 Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparation (including
consultation and disclosure) and-the significant issues and their treatment emerging from this analysis.
The project was classified under Category C for the following reasons:
Water Supply. Communities living near the Senegal River can build their wells as the water table is not
deep. The population in the rest of the country rely on support from the Ministere de l 'Hydraulique et de
l 'Energie (MHE) because groundwater is deep, requiring drilling equipment. Eligibility criteria for new
school construction include certification of existence of water in the area by the MHE so that no school can
be constructed without available water sources. This arrangement for bore-hole drilling has been effective
since the inception of the last two IDA projects, about 10 years ago, and will be updated under the
proposed program to ensure proper implementation of the school-water component.
Sanitation. The Govermment has developed and tested standard specifications for latrines, taking into
account the social context. The use of latrines is well established among the long-term sedentary
population and hence the use of school latrines will not pose difficulties. As for the nomads and those
recently sedentarized, the Govenmment is in the process of developing workable solutions. In addition to
providing new latrines, the proposed program will also retrofit existing schools with latrines and promote
school hygiene.
Waste water disposal. Waste water disposal is not a problem in the sedentary areas where the population
follow well-established practices. However, the nomads and those recently sedentarized, will have to be
introduced to hygiene practices as the process of sedentarization progresses. Under the school health
component, the Ministry of Health and NGOs will engage in this task to support the Ministry of Education.
Construction material. The communities use cement blocks and corrugated metal roofs as construction
materials since wood and stone are in short supply. The standard design and technical specifications are
embodied in the Agreements between the Ministry of Education and the communities.

5.5 What mechanisms have been established to monitor and evaluate the impact of the project on the
environment? Do the indicators reflect the objectives and results of the EMP?
Not applicable.
6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
Vulnerable groups. The prograzn targets activities to rural areas and to under-served regions where 75%
of the poor live. Most construction, rehabilitation, and provision of water and latrines will be in these
areas. The deconcentration of responsibilities and the subsequent better allocation of teachers and other
resources among regions will give poor communities equal access to public investments in education.
Finally, the project seeks to reach gender equity in education, with specific activities aimed at increasing
girls access and retention, particularly in secondary education and in low access regions.
Resettlement & land acquisition. The proposed program will not support school construction requiring
the resettlement of the population in Nouakchott and Nouadhibou because this will be done in the context
of the proposed Urban Project which will also deal with related resettlement issues. The remaining urban
areas of the country are not densely populated, and hence, no resettlement issues will arise. Similarly, there
will be no resettlement issues in rural areas. Furthermore, no land acquisition will be necessary in the
urban and rural areas covered by this proposed program.
6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating in the project?
Not Applicable
6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?
Community participation. Comnmunities are very supportive of the concept of schools construction and
latrines as a package. As in previous IDA projects, they will contribute to classroom construction and
guarantee subsequent maintenance of the facilities. The same arrangements used in the last two projects
(1990-2000), based on state-community partnership and where communities finance 30% of the cost of
classrooom construction will be applied. Some cost sharing will be continued while communities will be
100% financed by the credit for all other facilities.
NGO participation. Although the detailed procedures of the Government support to community-based
ECD programs, functional Literacy programs, and the traditional Mahadras has not yet been worked out, it
is expected that NGOs and communities that are active in these fields will be closely associated during
implementation and are likely to be sub-contracted to implement significant portions of these programs.
6.4 What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?
The project will be implemented by a Project Unit, staffed inter alia with three engineers and several
technicians who will be responsible for the classroom program in the country (each engineer and his team
being responsible for one third of the territory. They will visit the sites to assist communities at the various
stages of construction). The DH of the MHE will be responsible for the provision of water supplies, the
- 35 -



Ministry of Health and NGOs will deal with hygiene education and the provision of deworming pills and
micro-nutrients, and the communities will be responsible for the construction of schools and latrines.
Formal arrangements have been developed between these ministries to assure good coordination. At the
regional level, the project will reinforce inter-regional equity by reinforcing the structure and the
competences of the staff in the regional offices of the MEN and progressively delegating decision-making to
these offices. The new grant mechanism to channel funds to the schools through the SPIG will help to
empower the school boards and enhance ownership of schools by staff and communities.
6.5 How will the project monitor performance in terms of social development outcomes?
The project has detailed performance indicators for each component. These indicators will be updated on a
yearly basis by the Government and discussed with the financial partners during the annual joint reviews.
Moreover, As part of the PRSP process the Government has launched a Living Standard measurement
Survey (LSMS), which has a detailed education component and which will provide a baseline for most
impact indicators. The follow-up LSMS or household surveys that will be implemented as part of the
PRSP monitoring system will provide a useful basis to further assess of project outcomes.

7.2 Describe provisions made by the project to ensure compliance with applicable safeguard policies.
F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
The simulation model confirms that the major determinants of the financial sustainability of the program
are the teachers' compensation system and the transition rates from primary to lower-secondary. The
ESDP program would affect teachers' compensation policies significantly through an increase of 24% of
the average salary in real terms over the next decade, incentives for bilingual teachers, and incentives for
teachers appointed to remote areas. However, the average annual increase in the salary of individual
teachers is slightly lower than the rate of increase of the per capita GDP. As a result, in 2010 the average
teacher salary would represent 4.5 times the per capita GDP, against 5.1 times at present. Despite this
slight relative decrease, international comparisons show that the average teachers' compensation remains
reasonably high.
The transition rates from primary to lower-secondary and then to upper-secondary have been kept
unchanged from their current level of 50%. Yet, the combination of demographic growth and the
- 36 -



significant improvement of the retention rate of primary education would produce, over 10 years, a
substantial increase in the number of new students in the first year of secondary education, from 18,344 to
35,000, and an increase in total enrollment from 35,000 to 92,000. Simulations show that a higher
transition rate would be unrealistic. For example, a transition rate of 70% would imply an increase of the
new entrants to 48,000 per year and of total enrollment to 126,000. Although such an increase would be
desirable to achieve the goal of universal basic education quickly, it would not be feasible on financial
grounds and would almost certainly exceed the limit of the MEN planning and implementation capacities.
Given the policies discussed above, the ESDP would be sustainable with the following assumptions: (i)
realistic economic performance, based on an average annual economic growth of 6% and a rate of fiscal
mobilization of 27.8 %; and (ii) the share of education in total public revenues increasing from 13.5% to
16.5%, and as a share of GDP from 3.7% to 4.6%.
2. Critical Risks (reflecting the failure of critical assumptions found in the fourth column of Annex 1):

From Outputs to Objective
-The Government fails to maintain          N         This risk is considered low because of the high

from the current 13.6%                               substantial resources available for the
Government to be allocated to education.

obtained                                             available shortly. These surveys would produce
useful baseline data, and would be replicated
before the programs completion. The university
and technical and vocational systems will
complement these labor market information with
tracer studies of their graduates.
From Components to Outputs

quality objectives will not be reached                   14)
Overall Risk Rating                           S         Effective donor support and active piloting.
Risk Rating - H (High Risk), S (Substantial Risk), M (Modest Risk), N(Negligible or Low Risk)
The overall risk has been rated substantial, which leads to the development of strong risk-mitigating
policies and arrangements. The lack of information about the labor market, and particularly on
employment and on qualification requirements in the informal sector, is one of the risks considered to be
substantial. While the MEN has no mandate to carry out regular employment surveys (a special agency,
the Institut National des Statistiques, has this mandate), it will nevertheless develop tracer studies of TVT
and higher education graduates to assess their insertion and carry out specific sector studies to assess the
economic viability of the creation of new training institutions or the development of new courses within
existing institutions.
The ESDP's success will depend on the extent to which there will be efficient student flow controls in the
public system. As seen in section Fl, an increase in transition rates from primary to lower-secondary and
from lower-secondary to upper-secondary would put excessive pressure on the system's capacity to provide
high quality education. To mitigate those risks, the Govemment will put in place very strong regulatory
and financial incentives to develop the private education sector. IDA fully supports this policy.
Failure to implement this program successfully, in view of its large scope and MEN's currently limited
capacities, is another substantial risk. To mitigate this risk, the program will rely on the DPEF, which has
a strong implementation record, until the end of Phase 1. Additional risk-mitigating factors are: (i) the
existence of a detailed PIP, prepared through a participatory process to build ownership, (ii) the
commitment of the Govemment to recruit 2 procurement specialists by project effectiveness and 10
managers in the MEN, (iii) the reinforcement of the institutional capacity of the MEN and (iv) explicit
monitoring arrangements with attention to strong donor coordination, which will trigger quick palliative
reactions to identified deficiencies or delays.
Finally, education quality targets might not be reached. It may be difficult to find teachers with a good
mastery of the French language to implement the language of instruction reform. This reform requires a
substantial increase in the number French language teachers in primary education, and of science and math
teachers that can use French. The Govemment strategy tackles this issue from three different angles: (i)
adapting teacher recruitment policy in which permanent employment status will be awarded only to those
among the new recruits that show adequate progress in French, (ii) offering intensive in-service training
courses, as well as salary incentives, to the teachers currently in the system who show an aptitude and
willingness to become bilingual, and (iii) improving teacher deployment to optimize the use of bilingual
teachers who will be appointed as a matter of priority to multigrade classes and smaller schools, while
- 38 -



monolingual teachers will be appointed to larger schools. Moreover, detailed training and retraining
programs are being developed (see Annex 14).
3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
It is expected that social pressure to increase intakes in secondary education, TVT, and higher education
would build up quickly into political pressure, to a point where compliance with the macro-fmancial
framework might weaken. The Government needs to prepare an effective communication campaign and to
continue to involve a wider range of stakeholders in informal discussions about the program. To further
mitigate this risk, the Government would promote private education through an adequate legal and
regulatory framework and by setting up a Private Education Development Fund. International experiencs
shows that when there is an enabling legal and regulatory environment, as well as efficient financial
incentives, the growth of the private education sector is usually rapid and could become effective in
reducing the pressure on public education institutions.

Annex 2: Detailed Project Description
MAURITANIA: Education Sector Development Program
The principal objective of the Education Sector Development Program (ESDP) in Mauritania is to support
the Government's Programme National de Developpement du Secteur Educatif (PNDSE 2001-2010) in
its entirety. The ESDP is a sector-wide program that has four inter-related objectives: (1) to improve the
quality and relevance of teaching-learning processes and outcomes at all levels of the education sector, (2)
to promote greater access and regional and gender equity, especially at the primary and secondary levels,
(3) to increase the efficiency and relevance of the education system by fostering closer linkages between
technical, professional training and higher education, on one hand, and the labor market demands, on the
other hand, and (4) to enhance the administrative, pedagogical, and financial management capacity of the
individuals and the system as a whole. These four themes are closely linked and mutually reinforcing.

4. Magemnt
While the major investment of the proposed program will be at the primary level, the program covers all the
sub-sectors in the education sector: early childhood development, primary education, secondary education,
technical and professional training, higher education, school health, literacy, and the management of the
sector. The advantage of this comprehensive approach is to address system-wide issues in a coherent and
coordinated manner, to define clear priorities and to strengthen the linkages between the education sector
and the economy.
The proposed project is an APL with two phases planned from 2001 to 2010, lasting four and 5 years
respectively. The project (ESDP) builds on the long history of the Bank's engagement in the education
sector in Mauritania since 1975, especially the most recent General Education Project (Education V) and
the extensive sector study, including simulation exercises for the 2001-20 10 period, that was carried out in
2000 (Le systeme educatif mauritanien, elements d 'analyse pour instruire des politiques nouvelles) and
which was key in defining the Government 10-year education development program. The proposed ESDP
is therefore an integrated part of this Government program, and aims to support all its components.

Focus of Two Phases
The first phase of the ESDP will focus on: (1) implementing the Reform program in primary education and
preparing its implementation in secondary education, (2) piloting new initiatives in vocational and technical
education, higher education, literacy, early childhood development and school health, and evaluating these
experiences, and (3) building the institutional framework and capacity for more effective management in
the education sector. The Second phase will focus on: (1) consolidating the Reform in primary education,
(2) implementation of the Reform in secondary education, (3) expanding and institutionalizing successful
programs in vocational and technical education and higher education, and (4) institutionalizing the new
management framework developed during phase 1 and achieving the deconcentration of the MEN.

By Component:
Project Component I - US$107.63 million
Component 1. Improving the Quality and Internal Efficiency of Education
Objective
The objective of this component is to promote effective teaching-leaming processes in classrooms and
increase the internal efficiency of the education system by enhancing student achievements, reducing
repetition and dropout rates especially for girls and children in rural underserved areas. This will be
attained by improving bilingual and professional skills of teachers through revised pre-service and
in-service teacher education programs, providing pedagogic support to increase the competence of serving
teachers, providing textbook and other didactic materials, and assessing student performance to monitor the
quality of education provided.

Subcomponent 1-1: Improving the Oualitv of Teaching-Learning Contents. Processes and Outputs in
Primary Education
Key Strategies and Activities
a. Pre-service Training. The content and duration of existing pre-service teacher education program has
been found to be inadequate in providing primary school teachers and inspectors the professional skills
necessary for articulating school curricula and meeting pupils' learning needs. The ESDP supports the
re-design of pre-service training programs, emphasizing language skill development and more practical
teaching prior to certification. The training course content will be restructured to balance the student
teacher's mastery of content and teaching methodology in accordance with a teacher professional profile
that has recently been developed. Links between teacher training institutions (ENI) and primary schools
will be strengthened to ensure effective supervision and guidance of student teachers during practical
training. The pre-service training duration for teachers and inspectors will be extended from 1 to 2 years
and reduced from 4 to 2 years respectively. The first year which will mostly be college based, will be
devoted mainly to the development of language skills and mastery of curricula content, whilst the second
year will largely be spent practicing in primary schools. During this time student teachers will be
supervised by experienced teachers in the schools and tutors from the training college. Graduate teachers
will be qualified to teach all six grades and will be trained in multigrade teaching techniques in order to
facilitate the establishment of complete six-year primary cycles in all schools and ultimately improve the
utilization of teachers in the schools. It is estimated that approximately 1,300 student teachers and 80
student inspectors will be trained per year during the first phase of the program. To achieve qualitative
improvements in pre-service teacher education, the skills of teaching and administrative staff of training
colleges will be upgraded through intemal and extemal training programs.
(Phase 1) The first phase will focus on establishing a 'new vision' for professional teachers as articulated
in the "Teacher Professional Profile or Referentiel" that was drafted with French technical assistance. The
ESDP will fund activities to revise and apply the profile to teacher preparation and performance at each
career stage. The profile will include the following areas amongst others: knowledge of subject matter;
pedagogical skills; curricula knowledge; conduct, initiative and leadership. Current pre-service and
-47 -



in-service training courses will be mapped against the profile to deduce areas of strengths and weaknesses,
indicating where change is required and guide the development of strategic training modules. Teacher
educators, head teachers and inspectors will be assisted to apply the profile as part of their normal
appraisal procedures of trainees and serving teachers. Guidelines for the use of the profile will be developed
and workshops to refine its optimum use will be organized based on trials and feedback from key
stakeholders (teachers, teacher educators and professional associations). The profile will be used to define
standards for teacher certification. The ESDP will support the development, implementation, monitoring
and evaluation of the new training modules. At the end of their training, newly qualified teachers will each
be given a pedagogic kit comprising textbooks and guides to enable them to settle quickly into their new
classrooms when they take up duty.
(Phase 2) The revised training modules and their implementation at ENI will be evaluated in 2005/2006
with focus on language training and practical/professional training. The same evaluation will be carried
out for inspector training at ENS in 2007/2008. The training modules will be revised based on the
recommendations of the evaluations, to better integrate the subject knowledge, practical and professional
skills, and educational psychology in the training modules.
b. In-service training. The in-service training activities will have three objectives: (i) upgrading the
linguistic skills of the teachers to allow them to perform in a bilingual system, (ii) prepare the introduction
of new competency-based curricula, and (iii) provide continuous professional development to the teachers,
based on needs identification.
(Phase 1) In-service teacher training programs will be strengthened to increase the professional
competence of all primary teachers. Emphasis will be on the acquisition and implementation of practical
skills and the use of instructional materials to strengthen teaching. An action plan for in-service training
based on the identification of teachers' needs will be prepared. In-service training programs will be
organized for primary teachers, school directors, inspectors, pedagogic advisors, and tutors of ENI, with a
special emphasis on upgrading linguistic skills and mastery of curriculum content. To promote innovations
in pedagogy, action research will be conducted.
(Phase 2) The training program will be continued, with an emphasis on professional development. Based
on needs assessment and the recommendations of the evaluation report to be prepared in 2005, the teacher
training modules will be improved. Successful training programs at school levels which have been
developed during phase 1 will be brought to scale.
c. Development and dissemination of the new currlculum. This activity aims at testing and
implementing a new competency-based curriculum, which has been prepared in accordance with the reform
objectives.
(Phase 1) The new curricula will be tested for each grade, implemented and monitored in primary
education, including sensitization and orientation of teachers. An evaluation of the new curriculum - both
intended and implemented curriculum - will be conducted.
(Phase 2) Necessary revisions will be made in the primary education curriculum, based on their evaluation
during Phase 1.
d. Teaching-Learning Materials. This activity seeks to (i) achieve the provision and effective use of a
minimum package including a set of four textbooks per student, small-scale librarie,s and other teaching
- 48 -



and learning materials, (ii) provide a regulatory and institutional framework conducive to more effective
private sector participation in textbook publishing and distribution.
(Phase 1) This activity will procure and distribute free of charge a package of four textbooks for key
subjects (Arabic, French, Mathematics and Science) to all primary education students, for school use.
Alternative methods will be piloted in selected schools, depending upon the local context, and especially the
existence and commitment of a local parents association. This sub-component will also define the
minimum package of teaching-learning materials to be standardized and distributed to schools. Depending
on the size and situation of the schools, school libraries or "reading comer" will be promoted on an
experimental basis. A national textbook publishing and distribution policy will be developed and approved
before the end of 2003.
(Phase 2) The textbook distribution policy will be continued. Based on the evaluation of the activities of
phase 1, the content of textbooks and the teaching-leaming material package as well as their distribution
mechanism will be updated during the second phase. Successful textbook-use experiences will be shared at
regional and national levels. The small school library and reading corner experiences will be taken to scale.
The implementation of the national textbook publishing and distribution policy will be completed.
e. Student Assessment. This activity seeks to (i) develop systems, tools and practices for an effective
assessment of student achievement, (ii) help disseminate the assessment results at the school level and draw
policy lessons, (iii) help low performing schools develop a School Improvement Plan, and (iv) set up a
small grant fund to support the implementation of the School Improvement Plans.
(Phase 1) Both summative and formative student assessment will be reinforced, and teachers will be
trained in the practice of classroom continuous assessment. The selection exam for the access to secondary
education will focus more on key competences
than "memorization" of facts. This will require the training of the personnel involved in the administration
of exam in the design of testing instrument, correction method, and the management of exams. These
activities will be jointly coordinated by the DEF and the examination department of DES, IEF and IGEST.
(Phase 2) A systematic assessment practice will be consolidated in order to support teachers to assess their
student's progress. The school improvement grant system will be expanded.
Subcomponent 1-2: Improving the Oualitv and Internal Efficienev of Secondary Education
Key Strategies and Activities
Quality improvement of secondary education will be achieved through comprehensive and integrated
interventions in: curriculum development, pre- and in-service training, the provision of textbooks, materials
and science laboratories, and improving the working environment of teachers.
a. Development of new curriculum. In accordance with the Reform objectives, the new curriculum for
secondary education, including the curriculum for newly added 4th year of the I st cycle secondary school
(4AS), English from the 1st year (IAS) and the information technology from the 4th year (4AS), will be
developed and existing curriculum will be revised.
(Phase 1) The new curriculum will be experimented, evaluated, validated, and disseminated. Similarly for
the primary curriculum, the approach will be competency-based. The process of curriculum renewal and
- 49 -



development will be used as an opportunity to introduce population and family life education. The
preparation of the new and revised curriculum will take place during the first phase of the ESDP, and will
be introduced starting from the academic year 2004/05 to meet the implementation schedule of the reform
program.
(Phase 2) The implementation of the curricula will be continued in accordance to the implementation
schedule of the reform program, which is expected to add a new year to the first cycle of secondary
education in 2007-08 and to reach the last year of the second cycle in 2010-11.
b. Pre-service training. As for primary education, this activity seeks to define new secondary teacher
profiles in terms of required pedagogical skills, linguistic skills, professional conduct and
subject-knowledge competences, and to reorient pre-service training accordingly.
(Phase 1) This component will support the development of competency and skill profile/referential for
teachers and inspectors in secondary schools. The profile/referential will cover essential skills such as,
lesson planning & preparation, classroom management, student assessment, communication and facilitation
skills to engage community in school activities, etc. Similarly, training of teachers and inspectors will be
designed based on the profile/referential, which will be essential for better recruitment, supervision, and
support for teachers. Practical training component will be lengthened and strengthened through integration
of the "professionalization" module.
(Phase 2) The training programs will be consolidated.
c. In-service training. In-service training will be used mainly to prepare teachers to perform in a
bilingual environment and to provide professional development opportunities.
(Phase 1) During the first phase, research will be conducted to identify cost-effective ways to train
"potentially bilingual" teachers, such as intensive French-language training, language immersion, distance
training packages, etc. Training needs assessments will also be conducted to develop in-service
professional development programs, in accordance with the new profiles.
(Phase 2) The training process and outcome will be evaluated, and successful models will be expanded for
nation-wide implementation in the second phase.
d. Development and distribution of textbooks and equipment. The sub-component will support the
development and distribution of good-quality textbooks and teachers' guides for key subjects, laboratory
and computer equipment, and libraries to secondary schools. Secondary schools will also be eligible for
grants to finance school improvement projects.
(Phase 1) In accordance with the new curriculum, the textbook and teachers' guides will be developed,
tested, validated, and then disseminated. To promote and reinforce science education at secondary level,
science labs will be provided to colleges and lycees.
(Phase 2) Textbooks and teachers' guides developed during the phase 1 will be assessed and revised
accordingly. The investments in equipment for laboratories and libraries will be completed during Phase 2.
The grants for school improvement programs will be taken to scale.
e. Monitoring and Supervision. Monitoring and supervision activities will be shifted from a "policing"
tool to "facilitation" and "support" tool for teachers.
- 50 -



(Phase 1) New standardized inspection practices will be developed. Inspectors will be retrained and better
equipped logistically to carry out more frequent and meaningful supervision activities.
(Phase 2) The new curriculum and its implementation for the 2nd cycle of secondary education will be
evaluated.
Subcomponent 1-3. Promoting ECD Activities to enhance Physical. socio-emotional. and cognitive
development of children
Key strategies and Activities
This subcomponent aims to promote an integrated approach to the development of 3 to 6-year-old children
(physical, socio-emotional, and cognitive) by providing training and promoting the creation of new ECD
centers. This sub-component especially targets community and private initiatives in selected rural areas.
a. Training of ECD personnel. The sub-component will aim to develop a system of pre- and in-service
training for personnel who are engaged in ECD activities, particularly those personnel who have not
received any formal training prior to being hired by communities.
(Phase 1) Five existing resource centers for ECD at regional level will be reinforced, and 8 new centers
will be developed to support the ECD activities operated by the communities, and 3 existing centers will be
rehabilitated. In addition to those resource centers, a new institution, the National Center of ECD will be
established to coordinate and carry out the in-service training activities of ECD personnel and to prepare
and provide pre-service training modules for trainers and teachers of the ECD centers in urban areas. The
National Center of ECD will also conduct action research on ECD. Before the end of Phase 1, these
activities will be evaluated with a view to expanding their coverage during Phase 2.
(Phase 2) The objective of Phase 2 will be to consolidate the activities of Phase 1 and expand the systems
and structures to support the ECD activities piloted in Phase 1. At the same time, the new experiments in
in-service training and research will continue to inform innovative ways of delivering ECD services.
b. Management Capacity Building for ECD. To enhance the quality and coverage of service, the
management capacity of ECD personnel will be enhanced.
(Phase 1) The institutional framework for ECD activities will be defined, and the intersectoral committee
for ECD will be formed with the participation of SECF, MEN, MSAS, UNICEF, and other key actors.
The necessary material and human resources will be supplied for a better planning of ECD activities. The
system of monitoring and evaluation as well as a basic database of ECD programs, personnel and training
activities will be developed. To promote sensitization to ECD issues, communication strategies and tools
will be developed, targeting various audiences such as community leaders, opinion leaders, parents and the
civil society. Sensitization campaign activities will be planned, their outcome will be evaluated, and
successful actions will be expanded.
(Phase 2) During the Phase 2, the system will be decentralized. Periodic monitoring and evaluation
mechanisms will be institutionalized.
c. Promoting Community and Private Initiatives for ECD. The objective of this activity is to promote
community-based ECD programs.
- 51 -



(Phase 1) Appropriate ECD activities will be developed for the community nursery and preschools. The
teaching-learning materials and first aid kit will be distributed to conmmunity nursery and preschools in the
targeted areas, within the available resources at national level.
(Phase 2) Based on the experiences of Phase 1, the activity will be expanded for a wider coverage.
Sub-Comnonent 14. Promotine School Health
Key Strategies and Activities
This component seeks to improve the health status of students by promoting school hygiene and preventive
care, and reducing the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies. The distribution of drugs will be piloted in
a limited number of regions before being expanded during phase two.
a. Promoting good practice of hygiene and nutrition at school-level.
(Phase 1) To create awareness and promote good practice on hygiene and nutrition at school level: (i)
teachers will be trained on hygiene, nutrition and school health issues, (ii) school health and nutrition guides
will be prepared and 10,000 copies will be distributed to schools, (iii) radio and TV spots will be
broadcast.
(Phase 2) The activities during Phase 1 will be extended to all schools.
b. Promoting preventive health care
(Phase 1) A vaccination campaign will be organized at school level and, based on national surveys of
children's health and nutrition status, de-worming tablets and micronutrients will be distributed to students
to reduce the prevalence of iodine, iron and vitamin A deficiencies.
(Phase 2) Continuation of the hygiene and nutrition activities and expansion to all schools of
preventive-care activities.
Project Component 2 - US$132.30 million
Component 2. Promoting Access to and Equity in Education
Objective
The objective of the second component is to promote access to literacy and basic education, and to improve
the inter- and intra- regional and gender equity in education, especially at primary and secondary levels.
IDA will finance $15.8 million, and AfDB will finance $3.5 million for Component 2. The Govemment
contribution will be $96.1 million, HIPC $4.3 million, and local communities $4.9 million.
Key Indicators
*   59% of the primary schools offer a complete cycle (6 years of education) by 2005, and 100% by
2010.
- 52 -



*   Girls enrollnent in primaly education increases to 48% in 7 disadvantaged regions.
*   50% of the students completing primary education will access secondary education (although the
percentage remains the same throughout most of the current decade, the number of students
accessing grade 1 of secondary education will increase from the current 18,000 to 25,000 in 2005,
and to 30,000 in 2010 as more students will complete primary education.)
*   Gender parity in secondary education is reached in 2010
Subcomponent 2-1. Universal Access to Primary Education by 2005
Key Strategies and Activities
The main strategy to increase access in primary education is to transform existing incomplete schools into
complete schools with additional classrooms and multigrade teaching. At the same time, studies will be
conducted to identify the gender and regional disparities and to develop appropriate action plans.
a. Improving Planning Capacity
The objective of the component is to achieve appropriate planning of all educational inputs at the central
and regional levels and to achieve respect of the school mapping criteria by key stakeholders (Walis,
Mayors, etc.). The DPC will be responsible for this sub-component. The French Cooperation, IDA, and
AfDB will support the first phase.
(Phase 1). The objective of this phase will be to build planning capacities at the central and regional levels.
This sub-component will also reinforce the planning process and procedures and improve school mapping
tools to identify optimal steps and necessary inputs to transform the incomplete-cycle schools into complete
ones. This will be achieved through training of an adequate number of staff at the central and regional
levels, the development of participatory planning procedures including communities and regional and local
stakeholders, and the provision at each level of adequate planning tools. Data from the recently completed
census and LSMS surveys will be exploited to identify demand issues and causes of regional disparities in
access, repetition, and dropout, and specific actions will be developed.
(Phase 2) The planning responsibilities will be decentralized to the regional level while the central level
will ensure monitoring and evaluation, and support as needed, of the regionally executed planning.
b. Building Classrooms and equipping schools with latrines.
To achieve universal primary education this activity seeks to build adequate school facilities to
accommodate an increase of nearly 200,000 students (1998: 346,000; 2010: 546,000). Schools will be
retrofitted with latrines, office-storage and water supply. The DPEF will be responsible for this
sub-component, while the execution of the AfDB and IDA-financed constructions will be delegated to
eligible communities (PTA) under sub-projects contracted between PTA and DPEF, according to
procedures that have proven their effectiveness over the last 10 years. Under these arrangements,
communities are granted by the Government up to 70% of the estimated classroom cost and 100% of the
cost of other school facilities, such as latrines and Director offices. The first phase of this sub-component is
supported by IDA, through this project and the UDP, AfDB, FRD, CDHLCPI
(Phase 1) . The objectives of phase 1 are to: (i) complete incomplete schools through either the construction
of additional classrooms, the use of multigrade teaching, or a combination of both; (ii) provide access to
school to all 6-year old children at the end of the phase; (iii) replace 40% (about 800) of existing
- 53 -



classrooms built in non-permanent materials; (iv) test a new maintenance strategy based on transfer to
schools of maintenance funds. At the end of Phase 1 2,700 classroom will be built.
(Phase 2) During the second phase, construction and rehabilitation activities will continue at a rate of
about 600 classrooms per year. The program will give priority to the scaling-up of the maintenance
strategy tested in Phase 1.
c. Incentives for teachers in hardship areas. To improve equity in access, it is essential to deploy an
adequate number of qualified teachers in remote areas.
(Phase 1) Criteria for "hardship area" will be defined, and an incentive mechanism for teachers to serve in
these areas will be designed and implemented. Teachers in these areas who can potentially become
bilingual teachers will be identified through a survey, and they will receive priority for retraining.
(Phase 2) An incentive mechanism developed in Phase I will be implemented and evaluated.
Subcomponent 2-2. Increasing Access to and Equity in Secondary Education
Key strategies and activities
With the number of students completing primary school on the increase, the demand for secondary
education is inevitably on a sharp rise. To meet the demand for schooling at that level in a systematic and
financially feasible way, the transition rate from the primary to the 1 st cycle of the secondary will be
limited to 50% through 2010, although the absolute number of the students will increase.
a. Reinforcing planning capacity.
Complementary to new construction and rehabilitation, effective school rmapping will be instrumental to
realize an optimal distribution and construction of facilities. Coordination between the central Govermment
and key stakeholders such as NGOs, community, and school management committee will be strengthened.
(Phase 1) New planning procedures, involving parents and local authorities in decision-making will be
piloted. The persons responsible for school mapping for secondary education in DPC and in the regional
offices will be designated and trained. The office responsible for school mapping will be equipped with
computers. The database for school mapping will become operational.
(Phase 2) The planning procedures will be generalized during the second phase; regional antennas will be
made operational with necessary equipment and the capacity to make decisions locally. Two technical staff
will be trained in school data collection and analysis in each region.
b. Improving Access.
In order to increase access to the I st cycle of secondary education, both human and physical resources will
be expanded, and particular attention will be paid to gender issues, which are more acute at this level than
in primary education. DPC and DES will be responsible for this activity.
(Phase 1) 600 teachers (150 each year) will be recruited; 30 new colleges with 8 classrooms, 160
extension classrooms, and 40 new latrines will be built; 1,000 classrooms and 300 latrines will be
rehabilitated; 250 computers, 50,000 student desks and benches, 700 office shelves, 500 administrative
- 54-



office desks, and 1,300 desks for teachers will be supplied. In addition, equipment for one teacher's room
per collge/lycee will be supplied. The Government will also promote access of girls to secondary
education through a pilot program of parent-operated boarding facilities, supported by several UN donors.
Based on the findings of the study and the pilot program, appropriate actions and communication strategies
will be developed to promote girls' schooling.
(Phase 2) 1,000 teachers (200 each year) will be recruited; 34 new collIges, 100 classrooms, and 60
latrines (to extend existing colleges) will be built; and 500 office desks, 700 desks for teachers, and 500
shelves will be supplied.
Sub-component 2-3: Promotin2 the Private Sector Involvement in Education.
With increasing demand for education, the role of the private sector will be crucial in complementing the
public provision of education. This sub-component primarily concerns secondary, vocational, and higher
education institutions to supplement the Government effort at those levels and promote diversify and
innovation.
(Phase 1) The sub-component will explore appropriate regulations and mechanisms to support and
promote the private sector and establish institutional and legal frameworks to monitor the private sector and
implement quality assurance mechanisms. A grants fund will be implemented to benefit private sector
institutions. The fund's guidelines and operation procedures will be developed during the first phase of the
ESDP.
(Phase 2) The institutional framework and the fund to support private schools will be evaluated and
improved as necessary.
Subcomponent 24. Promoting Functional Literacy and Non-Formal Education
Key Strategies and Activities
A principal strategy for improving literacy in Mauritania is to (i) develop the capacity of the SEAEO to
plan and manage the new literacy programs; (ii) operate a better linkage between the modem education
system and the traditional Mahadras, by promoting twinning arrangements between individual schools and
Mahadras with a view to facilitating the transition of students between the formal education and the
Mahadras systems. It is expected that 24% of the 1,700 Mahadras will have been "modernized" in 2005
against currently 8%; (iii) gradually phase out the national literacy campaigns and replace them by a
variety of functional literacy programs, developed and operated by NGOs and communities. These
functional literacy programs will be adapted to local needs, targeted to vulnerable populations, and aimed
at promoting income generation.
(Phase 1) The following activities will be carried out, on a pilot basis, by participating literacy providers
and promoted and coordinated by the SEAEO: (i) development of functional literacy programs that are
relevant to identified economic and social needs and specifically targeted populations; (ii) mobilization of
various actors (NGOs, comnunity groups, professional associations) to design and deliver literacy
programs; (iii) capacity building of the core literacy personnel, training of material developers and trainers;
(iv) action research and development of teaching-learning materials and assessment of the outcome of the
activities. The implementation of the new modes for literacy support requires the development of detailed
procedures and monitoring mechanisms, through the provision of technical assistance and the staff
exchange with countries that have relevant experience.
- 55 -



(Phase 2) The objective is to take to scale the activities of Phase 1.
Subcomponent 2-5. Promotin! Girls Education
Key Strategies and Activities
The objective of this subcomponent is to continue the successful activities started under the IDA V project
and to imnprove the knowledge base relative to the determinants of the main obstacles to girls access and
retention.
(Phase 1) The public awareness campaigns are continued. Small-scale colleges and community-based
accommodations will be piloted to promote access of girls in rural areas. In order to improve the
enrollment and retention of girls, a study will be conducted to identify possible causes of girls'
non-attendance and dropout particularly in the 7 low-enrollment regions. Based on the findings of the
study, appropriate sensitization and communication strategies will be developed to promote girls' schooling
both at primary and secondary levels.
(Phase 2) The successful activities will be consolidated, particularly the measures aimed at increasing the
access of girls in rural areas.
Project Component 3- USS 64.79 million
Component 3. Improving the Efficiency of the Technical, Vocational and Higher Education Systems
Objective
The overall objective of the third component is to foster and strengthen two-way linkages between
technical, vocational and higher education and the labor-market. Shorter and more flexible training
programs will be emphasized as well as more job-related content in the curricula, consultation with
enterprises and greater autonomy and accountability of training and higher education institutions.
The contributions of various development partners on Component 3 will be the following: IDA $1 1.7
million, AfDB $11.4 million, Cooperation Francaise $0.01 million, and Islamic Development Bank $3.8
million. The Government will finance $23.4 million, HIPC $3.3 million, and the private sector will
contribute $0.3 million.
Key Indicators
* The private sector represents 20% in the service delivery of technical and professional training by
2005.
* Technical and vocational training with apprenticeship and dual program represents 200 trainees by
2005 and 500 in 2010.
*   Students in professionally oriented courses in the university represent 15% of total enrollment by
2005.
*   The internal efficiency of higher education institutions increases from 23% to 28% in 2005 and to
60% in 2010.
Subcomponent 3-1. Makin2 Technical and Professional Training More Responsive to Market
Demands
- 56 -



Key Strategies and Activities
The principal strategy is to make the technical and professional training more responsive to the demand of
the labor market. To this end, the policy consists in (i) using innovative financing mechanisms to promote
demand-driven training programs, as well as flexible and shorter training programs for the non-formal
sector, (ii) developing an adequate institutional framework to manage funds and promote the renovation of
the training programs and (iii) providing incentives to promote private TVT institutions.
a. Establishment of a Technical and Vocational Training Fund (TVTF). This Fund's objective is to
help enterprises better define and articulate the private sector demands for training (including
apprenticeship, intemship, sandwich program, etc.) and to encourage the training institutes to meet these
demands. Capitalizing upon the experience of Fonds d 'Appui aux Actions de Formation (FAAF) which
was piloted in a previous IDA project (Education IV), the Fund will finance 80%/0 of eligible in-service
training activities proposed by enterprises, or new pre-service training programs developed jointly by
enterprises and public or private training centers, based on agreed eligibility criteria. The establishment of
the Fund was already approved by the Government, and the procedure manual has been prepared and will
be finalized by the Fund's Board after its appointment. The Fund will be managed by a Board which has
an equal number of representatives from the Government and the private sector.
(Phase 1) The administrative structure and procedures for the Fund operation will be established and the
Fund will be operational. The TVTF is expected to have a significant impact by 2005, with more than 200
trainees per year in apprenticeship training schemes and 10% of the formal enterprises which have more
than 10 employees participating in in-service training activities. With the Fund's financial support, new
training modes and programs, such as internship, apprenticeship and sandwich program will be developed
by the training centers, tested, and evaluated. Because of the shorter and dual nature of the new training
programs, an increase of the total number of trainees from 2,450 to 5,100 is expected by the year 2005.
(Phase 2) The Fund's financing mechanisms and administrative procedures will be adjusted and improved
on the basis of several years of operation, in order to expand its capacity to promote innovative training
schemes. By 2010, 25% of the 'formal' sector enterprises that have more than 10 employees will be
participating in in-service training programs and a total of 2000 trainees will be enrolled in apprenticeship
training schemes. The total number of trainees will reach 10,000 by 2010.
b. Institutional Framework for Technical and Professional Training.
In order to promote the quality and effectiveness of training activities, the institutional framework of the
TVT system will be reinforced through: (i) effective coordination mechanisms among the various
ministries that manage training activities or operate training centers, (ii) permanent consultation with the
private enterprises and the private training institutions, and (iii) monitoring the labor market demands as
well as the performance of the training programs through the insertion rate of their graduates; and (iv)
managing the training fund. This institutional framework is composed of:
*   An inter-ministerial committee, chaired by the minister of education, and including all ministries
involved in TVT training. This Committee will review sector policies and coordinate training
programs.
* A National Institute for the Promotion of Technical and Professional Training (L 'Institut National de
Promotion de la Formation Technique et Professionnelle: INP-FTP), which will be created under the
responsibility of the MEN. The INP-FTP is a structure which capitalizes on the pilot Resource and
- 57 -



Monitoring Center (Centre de Ressources et de Suivi) established under the Education IV project. It
will have the following responsibilities: (i) management of TVTF, (ii) monitoring of labor market
demand and identification of training needs, (iii) provision of in-service training to upgrade the skills of
the training instructors, (iv) monitoring and evaluation of the perfornance of the training programs,
and (v) providing technical support to the training centers for the renovation of the upgrading or
renewal of their training programs. The INP-FTP has a administrative board that includes
representatives of the private sector.
*   The technical and Vocational Training Support Fund (TVTF) is created as a financially autonomous
body, assisted administratively by a special unit within the INP-FTP. The financing decisions are
made by the TVTF Board.
(Phase 1) The institutional framework described above will be implemented and all mechanisms and
procedures will be operational. Labor market information and enterprises' demand for skills will be
analyzed regularly to identify priority training areas. A system for validation and accreditation of the new
training programs will be developed. A training program for technical and administrative staff of
NP-FTP, as well as tutors, instructors and administrative staff in the training centers will be implemented
to develop the competences necessary to the functioning of the new system.
(Phase 2) The institutional structure established during the first phase will be reinforced during phase 2 to
quickly adapt to the needs of the economy. The evaluation of the extent to which a strong partnership with
enterprises has been established will be carried out and the lessons learned will be reflected in the future
activity and the consolidation of the successful initiatives.
c. Upgrading the human and physical capacities of the Technical and Professional Training Centers
Introducing the new modes of training program such as apprenticeship and sandwich program
(Subcomponent 3-1) requires the hiring of tutors, new instructors and trainers and the organization of
in-service training activities for the training centers technical and administrative staff. There is also a need
to upgrade the training centers facilities and training equipment.
(Phase 1) Complementary to the introduction of the new training program, instructors and tutors of the
technical and professional training will be trained through pre- and in-service training. Existing training
facilities and equipment will be upgraded. An economic and feasibility study will be required prior to each
extension or creation of a new training center.
(Phase 2) Based on the result of the phase 1 experiments, further expansion of the system capacity is
envisaged.
Subcomponent 3-2. Improving the Oualitv and Efficiency of Higher Education
Key Strategies and Activities
The main objective of this sub-component is to improve the quality, diversity, and responsiveness to labor
market demands of the higher education institutions. This requires (i) a better match between the number
of students and the teaching resources available, (ii) increased autonomy and accountability of the higher
education institutions, (iii) better use of public funds, and (iv) increased emphasis on professional degrees.
a. Enhancing the autonomy of the university
- 58 -



Higher education institutions lack administrative, financial and pedagogic autonomy. They are not allowed
to hire teaching staff under contract; there are regulatory restrictions that hamper their ability to raise funds
and to use them efficiently; and the validation of new academic programs are subject to lengthy
bureaucratic procedures. To deal with these issues the Government will develop a new law for higher
education that introduces significant changes in the statutes of the university, leading to greater autonomy
and at the same time more accountability of the higher learning institutions.
(Phase 1) The clear responsibility and the division of labor between the central administration for higher
education, DESup (La Direction de I 'Enseignement Superieur), the University of Nouakchott and each
higher education institution will be redefined and clarified. The nature and scope of academic, financial,
and administrative autonomy to be granted to each level, as well as the responsibility in terms of monitoring
and evaluation will be delineated. Strategies and performance targets for individual institutions will be
negotiated with the state, which provides funding, and materialized in a 3-year contract-program. The
contract-program emphasizes the state's funding and policy role as well as the institutions' responsibility for
reaching agreed academic results, resource mobilization targets, and efficient management of funds. These
principles will be the backbone of a law to be passed and implemented before the end of Phase 1. At the
same time, the university system will receive technical assistance training to build its capacity to manage
higher education institutions in accordance with the new framework.
(Phase 2) The institutional frarnework established during the first phase to enhance the autonomy of the
higher education institutes will be consolidated. The proportion of auto-financing of the individual
institutions will be increased.
b. Rationalizing the utilization of public funds
The funding of the university of Nouakchott and the individual institutions is neither related to the actual
needs of these institutions nor to their academic performance. This situation can be explained by the
inadequacy of public subsidies as well as the absence of rational funding mechanisms. To address these
issues the Government will increase funding available to the national institutions by reducing expenditures
on scholarships abroad, reinvest savings in academic inputs, and develop and implement a transparent and
rigorous fund allocation formula.
(Phase 1) The implementation of this strategy requires the provision of a variety of inputs, including
training, technical assistance and study tours for key administrative staff of the MEN, the university of
Nouakchott and the individual institutions. The provision of these inputs will be clustered in coherent
procurement packages, with clearly identified objectives, that will be awarded to foreign universities which
have demonstrated knowledge in resource allocation and management. These procurement packages
include such inputs as, provision of training, transfer of know-how and procedures, and technical assistance
during the design and implementation phase.
(Phase 2) To maintain the efficient use of public finance in the higher education, the administration of
scholarship will be transferred to an autonomous institution, Centre National des Oeuvres Universitaire,
which will be created to manage the nonacademic functions currently under the responsibility of the
university, such as the operation of student accommodations facilities and restaurants.
c. Improving the science and technology teaching and research
Less than 8% of the students are currently enrolled in science and technology streams. While an increase
of this proportion requires the enrollment of more students in the scientific streams of secondary education,
- 59 -



a number of improvements are necessary at the higher education level. The major improvements that are
sought include (i) the upgrading of the skills of the faculty through exchange programs with foreign
universities, (ii) a better linkage between research and teaching, and (iii) the use of new communication
and information technology to promote the delivery of lecture through video-conferencing, link with other
universities, including the African Virtual University, audio-visual training, sharing of research resources,
etc...
(Phase 1) To promote applied research in science and technology, a research fund will be created. Priority
for funding will be given to applied research which has potential impact on enhancing the teaching of
science subjects or the productivity of the economy. The quality of research will be strengthened through
training of the doctoral students in partnership with other universities. Exchange programs for researchers
with other institutions will be clustered and procured as a package of coherent and targeted inputs.
(Phase 2) In-service training of professors will be continued, and professors will be encouraged to pursue
higher academic qualifications. The criteria for the evaluation and accreditation of research will be
established during the second phase.
d. Professionalization and diversification of the courses
Higher education institutions will seek a partnership with the private sector and reinforce the linkage with
the labor market demands. Based on the study on the current labor market demands and the rate of
insertion from the higher education institutes, more diversified and professionally-oriented courses will be
offered, particularly 2-year diplomas.
(Phase 1) The development of new courses will be decided on a case by case basis, after consultation with
the private sector and potential employers, as well as feasibility studies. It will be built on the limited
experiences that were implemented in recent years with technical assistance from foreign universities. By
the end of Phase 1, 15 % of the students will be enrolled in professionally-oriented degrees.
(Phase 2) The experience with the professionally-oriented degrees and courses will be evaluated and
extended to all the institutions.

Subcomponent 4-1. Developinty Overall Monitoring Structure
Key Strategies and Activities
The objective is to implement a result-oriented monitoring and management system, by providing managers
with adequate information, standardized procedures and criteria for resource allocation.
a. Educational Management Information System
(Phase 1) The objective of this sub-component is to develop an Educational Management Information
Systems (EMIS,) which will be user-friendly, and emphasizes data analysis and action, and to make it
available for decision-making at the central level. The EMIS includes information on student, teachers,
school, exams and finance, and criteria and guideline for decision-making. The procedure for data
collection and presentation will be standardized. Key personnel at both the national and regional levels will
be trained in the use of EMIS.
(Phase 2) The EMIS will be implemented and operational both at the central and regional levels, enabling
the sharing of infornation among all the Directorates and Regional Offices.
b. Planning and School Mapping Procedures
(Phase 1) This activity will modemize the planning procedures by (i) integrating demographic and
contextual information in the decision making process, (ii) including consultation with the beneficiaries in
the decision-making process for school construction and extension, and (iii) integrate the use of modem
planning tools, such as geographic information systems, in the planning process.
(Phase 2) Deconcentration of school construction planning at regional level.
Subcomponent 4-2. Improvine the Management of Human Resources in the Education Sector
Key Strategies and Activities
The overall strategy of this sub-component is to modernize the human resource management system and
practices in order to create an institutional framework and enviromnent conducive to good performance of
teachers, inspectors, school directors, administrative staff, and MEN officers.
(Phase 1) The activities aim to: (i) reorganize the structure responsible for the human resource
management, define its mission and responsibilities, upgrade the managerial skills of it personnel; (ii)
consolidate personnel data to include administrative information and job profile in a single comprehensive
and reliable database that will become the unique source of informnation for decision-making on teaching
and non- teaching staff issues; (iii) expand the teachers career development system to include performance
incentives; (iv) contribute to rationalizing teacher deployment by developing and testing criteria for
-61 -



hardship compensation and rotation periods, as well as a monitoring system with quantitative goals, and (v)
improve staff professional behavior by developing guidelines and implementing sensitization activities for
teachers, directors and inspectors.
(Phase 2) During the second phase, necessary revisions in the system and criteria will be made, and
appropriate responsibilities in human resource management will be delegated to the regional offices.
Subcomponent 4-3. Developing a Pedagogic Monitoring System Based on Results
Key Strategies and Activities
The objective of this activity is to reduce the observed variance in the results of individual schools, by
setting up appropriate monitoring systems for school perfornance, and mechanisms to address the causes
of low performance. This includes: (i) establishing performance-based management system; (ii) setting up
a fund to support innovative school program; (iii) development of school management guidelines; and (iv)
improving exam management systems.
(Phase 1) the school perfornance assessment systems will be established and assessment results made
available to the schools to allow them to reflect on their performance. Small grants for school improvement
will be allocated to low-performing schools, based on the preparation of a school improvement plan and
eligibility criteria to be defined. For inspectors, the evaluation criteria of the schools and teachers'
performance, observation tools will be developed and standardized. The guidelines for the management of
textbooks, library books and didactic equipment at school level will be developed, printed and disseminated.
To improve equity, criteria for graduation exams at the end of primary education will gradually be
standardized, and the transition exams from primary to secondary education will be revised. Similarly, the
exam at the secondary level will be reviewed and rationalized to improve equity. An exam office will be
created to manage the technical and logistical aspects of the examination system.
(Phase 2) The feedback from phase 1 will be incorporated to improve the assessment systems and support
for inspectors. The guidelines will be modified as necessary. Based on the results from Phase 1, selection
exam and transition procedure will be consolidated.
Subcomwonent 4-4. Improving Financial and Administrative Management
Key Strategies and Activities
The objective of this component is to deconcentrate MEN responsibilities, based on the recommendations
of the management audit report completed in 2000.
(Phase 1) The following activities will be implemented: (i) promulgation of the new organization chart of
the MEN, including the establishment of the DRENs; (ii) appointment or retraining of key administrative
staff in accordance with detailed job profiles to be established, and reinforcement of the DAFM; (iii)
creation of physical structures for the DREN and allocation of human resources and equipment; and (iv)
deconcentrating relevant responsibilities to the DREN and assessing results.
(phase 2) Transfer of the implementation of the Donors-financed project from the DPEF to the MEN and
deepening of the deconcentration process.

Annex 4: Cost Effectiveness Analysis Summary
MAURITANIA: Education Sector Development Program
This Annex presents the economic analysis of the Mauritania's Education Sector Development Program
(ESDP). Specifically, the following aspects are analyzed: (1) macro economic framework, (2) the ESDP's
linkages with the PRSP and the CAS, (3) key findings from the Economic and Sector Work, (4) financing
of the education sector, (5) financial and sensitivity analysis, (6) the role of the public sector, and (7) cost
effectiveness analysis.
The economic analysis concludes that the objectives and strategies of the ESDP are congruent and mutually
supportive with the PRSP 2000 and the CAS 1997 and viable in the current and prospective
macroeconomic framework. The achievement of good quality basic education for all with higher
completion and achievement rates would be instrumental in developing the productivity of the poor, while
making the higher education and technical training more flexible and responsive to market demands would
contribute to the generation of human capital for the modem economic sector, thereby fueling economic
growth.
1. Macroecononmc Framework
Significant progress has been made in macroeconomic indicators as a result of the structural adjustment
policies implemented since 1992 by the Government of Mauritania. Between 1992 and 1999, the current
account deficit (excluding public transfers) fell from SDR -139.2 million to SDR -26.8 million. The
inflation rate was brought down to 4%. During this period, a policy aimed at public finance restructuring
was pursued, which led to budgetary surpluses amounting to UM 5 billion on average over the past four
years. This is a significant achievement compared to 1994 when the deficit stood at more than UM 12.5
million. The PRSP policy objective is to maintain a GDP annual growth rate of 6% on average over the
next five years.
Despite these favorable trends, Mauritania remains vulnerable from a foreign trade standpoint because of
the country's dependence on the export of primary products (iron and fish), which are subject to price and
quantity fluctuations. The vulnerability of the economy together with pressure on foreign exchange have
forced the Government to follow restrictive monetary and budgetary policies. The restructuring of public
finance and foreign debt relief from HIPC initiatives are now expected to allow controlled relief of
monetary and budgetary policies.
2. Linkages with the CAS and Poverty Reduction Strategy
The Education Sector Development Program is closely linked with, and mutually supportive of the key
themes of the PRSP. The PRSP 2000 is built upon four main themes: (i) accelerating economic growth
through its direct and indirect impact on job creation and through its impact on the Govemment's budget
revenues, (ii) developing the growth potential and productivity of the poor, (iii) developing human resources
and access to essential infrastructure, and (iv) promoting true institutional development based upon good
govemance and on full participation of all parties involved in poverty alleviation.
The Mauritanian economy is, and will likely remain, a dual economy in the foreseeable future, combining a
modem sector and a traditional economy. The challenge for the education sector is to meet the demand for
this dual economy. Good quality basic education for all, which is one of the major objectives of the ESDP,
- 64 -



would directly contribute to increase the productivity of the poor and develop the human capital basis.
Technical and vocational training and higher education which are more flexible and geared to the market
demands would contribute to meeting the demand of the modem economic sector in the country.
Strengthening the management system and practices in the education sector would be a critical part of the
fourth theme of the PRSP, institutional development and good governance.
Specifically, the PRSP 2000 states that "the Government's education strategy aims to ensure for each
Mauritanian child ten years of basic schooling (6 years of primary plus 4 years of the first cycle of
secondary school), adapted to the cultural milieu and accessible to all, followed by training opportunities
tailored to current and future labor market demands." The envisaged outcomes of the ESDP support these
goals. An effective implementation of the ESDP would contribute to poverty alleviation through its effects
on overall economic growth (productivity gains through improved quality and relevance of education and
training contents and other externalities such as improved women's health) and improved equity in
education (empowerment of the poor and disadvantaged groups through universal access to basic
education).
In the rural areas where 76% of the poor live, low productivity is an important factor for poverty. The
analysis from the household survey shows a correlation between years of schooling and the poverty level.
The proposed program would help rural children have access and complete basic education with better and
more relevant knowledge and skills for further education and/or for employment. To address equity and
target the disadvantaged, the first phase of the proposed APL envisages several studies, including a study to
identify the cause of regional and gender disparity in retention and student achievement, and a study to
identify the causes of girls dropout. The Government's ten-year education sector program is clearly
pro-poor with its focus on access, retention, and quality of basic education in rural and semi-urban areas
where the poor are concentrated.
3. Key Issues Identified in the Education Sector Study 2000
In developing the policy objectives of the Education Sector Development Program, the education sector
analysis (Le systeme educatif mauritanien: elements d 'analyse pour instruire des politiques nouvelles,
May 2000) played a critical role in identifying key issues, defining sector priorities, and developing
strategies. The sector study was prepared in the context of HIPC initiative. The sector-study team consists
of key staff from the MAED, MEN, Ministry of Finance, and the University of Nouakchott, with technical
assistance from the World Bank. Some of the key issues in the sector study which are relevant to the
ESDP are presented below.
Access
Access to primary education expanded rapidly during the 1990s; the gross enrollment rate in primary
education increased from 41.5% in 1985/86 to 85.5% in 1998/99. Gross enrollment rates at the first cycle
of secondary school (grade 7-9) and at higher education marked a modest increase from 14.8% in 1985/86
to 20.4% in 1998/99, and from 3.8% in 1985/86 to 6.8% in 1998/99 respectively. The GERs in the second
cycle of secondary education and vocational and technical training remained approximately at the same
level since 1985.

Iternal Efficiency
Although considerable progress has been made to access, internal efficiency remains low throughout the
education system. First, repetition rates at each grade level are high, and they have improved only slightly
in primary and first cycle of secondary education during the last 15 years, as shown in the table below.
The repetition rate in second cycle of secondary education has improved in recent years, but remains high
in the last grade ("terminale") as students repeatedly fail the baccalaureate exam.

Second, the retention rate also remains low, especially at the primary level. The retention rate of students
from Grade I to Grade 6 was 55% in 1996-99. The retention rate of the 1st cycle secondary school (lAS
to 3AS) has decreased from 84% in 1991-94 to 71% in 1996-99. Although the retention rate at the 2nd
cycle of secondary school seems better than that of primary and 1st cycle secondary, only 43% of those
who enter the 2nd cycle secondary education pass the baccalaureate exam. Based on these ratios, of 100
children of school-going age, only 7.7 receive their BAC degree at the end of secondary education. The
internal efficiency of higher education is likewise low. Only 12% of Humanities (FLSH: Faculte des
Lettres et Sciences Humaines) and Social Science (FSJE: Faculte des Sciences Juridiques et
Economiques) students obtain a graduate degree after four years.

One of the major causes of high repetition and dropout (i.e., low intemal efficiency in primary education)
in Mauritania is the existence of "incomplete" schools. As the table below shows, 23% of primary schools
offer only one grade while 18% of the schools offer 6 grades. It is often the case that schools do not offer
opportunities for students to proceed to the next grade level each year, which inevitably leads to students
repeating or dropping out from the school. The problem seems to be largely on the supply side.
Profile of Primary Schools
Number of        Number of
Schools (%)      students (%)
School offering one grade level       566 (23)         25,490 (8)
School offering two grade levels      966 (39)         58,955 (18)

"Complete-cycle schools" do not necessarily mean schools with a minimum of 6 classrooms with 6 teachers
for Grade 1-6 every year. In the Mauritanian context, even if the schools offer three grade levels with each
cohort starting every other year (alternate year intake), as long as the students can proceed from one grade
to the next till Grade 6, they are considered as complete-cycle schools. Likewise, schools with multigrade
teaching in which students can advance by one grade level every year, are considered complete-cycle
schools. According to the Sector Study, if all students had access to complete-cycle schools, the current
level of retention rate would improve from the current 55% from Grade 1 to 6, to approximately 85%.
- 67 -



This is indeed the case in the schools offering continued progression from Grade I to 6, even in the rural
areas.
hnternal inefficiencies of the education system are also seen in the uneven deployment of teachers
throughout the country. The average number of the teachers per 150 students varies to a great extent: the
highest of 5.08 in Tiris Zemmour, the lowest of 1.83 in Nouadhibou, and the national average of 3.14. The
table below presents the wide variation of the student-teacher ratios (for the schools with 150 students) in
different regions of the country. In addition, the ratio varies within the region.

External Efficiency
External efficiency (feeding students into the economy) of the system is low because there is little
collaboration between the technical and vocational training systems, higher education streams, and the
labor market in terms of training programs, development and implementation, financing of the training,
and feedback between employers, employees and training institutions. The small scale of the formal
modem economic sector which is still in the early development stage - and dominance of the informal
sector -- also constrains external efficiency of the education system.
The lack of an established national policy in the past has led to the growth of a student population poorly
equipped for available employment opportunities. A mechanism to regulate student flows has not been
established, resulting, therefore, in a surplus of students, as compared to countries with socio-economic
indicators similar to those of Mauritania. Furthermore, a lack of information regarding the country's
quantitative and qualitative needs for human resources with higher education has led to a fairly large
number of unemployed graduates. As the table below shows, the numbers of unemployed degree-holders in
the Humanities (Faculte des Lettres et Sciences Humaines: FLSH) and in Social Science (Faculte des
Sciences Juridiques et Economiques: FSJE) are increasing; 41.2% in FLSH and 35.1% in FSJE in 1998.

Methodological training techniques have not changed with the times in Mauritania. There is still a
noticeable emphasis on theoretical lectures and little applied training. In addition, the proportion of
students majoring in Science and Technology at the University of Nouakchott has traditionally been and
remains surprisingly low at less than 10%.

Ouality
Quality improvement in education is one of the most critical needs of Mauritania's Education system, and
various factors appear to be responsible for its current poor quality: the lack of pedagogical support,
inefficient human resource management system-wide, insufficient textbooks and teaching materials both for
students and teachers (less than one-third of students in primary school had a textbook and one-fourth of
teachers had a textbook or guide in 1998), and high student-teacher ratios, particularly in the urban area.
Students at the primary level on average master 50% of the intended curriculum content, while students in
the worst-perfonning schools acquire only 10% of the intended curriculum against 80% in the best
performing schools. The success rate for BEPC is 61% for males and 55% for females.

Equit(
Although Mauritania does better than neighboring Western African countries in regards to equity in
education, gender- and regional- equity can and must be improved. At the end of the primary cycle (Grade
6), 63.8% of girls in urban areas have access to ongoing education, while only 38.4% of girls in rural areas
have access to local schools. The secondary education enrollment rate for males exceeds that of females by
about 10%.
4. Education Finance
Public resources for the education sector has increased steadily over the last 15 years. Intra-sectoral
distribution of the recurrent budget has also changed. The percentage of recurrent budget expenditure in
primary education against the total expenditure has increased steadily from 32.3% in 1985 to 43.3% in
1998 while that of higher education has decreased from 28.4% in 1985 to 18.6% in 1998. The share of
TVT has also decreased, from 6% in 1985 to 4% in 1998.

5. Financial and Sensitivity analysis
The Government of Mauritania has prepared its 10-year education sector development program based on
the simulation of key sets of policies and the macro-economic framework. Available public finance and
recurrent cost needs are calculated based on the data on key indicators in 1998, a projection of these
indicators and the policy objectives for 2010.
Following is a summary of the main results of the simulation and sensitivity analysis. Detailed financial
analysis is in Annex 11. The base scenario was built on the following projections and Government policies.
The annual growth rate of GDP would remain at 6% through 2010 as envisaged in the PRSP. The
percentage of the recurrent cost for education in the total national revenue would rise from the 13.5% in
1998 to 16.6% in 2010 as indicated in the Government sector policy. Access to Grade 1 in primary
education would rise from 90% in 1998 to 100% by 2010. Retention rate in primary education would rise
from 55% in 1998 to 78% by 2010 with all primary schools offering a complete cycle. According to the
Government policy, the teachers salary for primary education would decline to 4.7 times per capita GDP in
2010 from the 1998 level of 5.1. In the projection model, the teacher salary is linked with the GDP. The
Government intends to reduce the student-teacher ratio in primary education from 48:1 in 1998 to 40:1 by
2010. It also plans to increase the proportion of non-salary recurrent expenditure as a percentage of total
teacher salary from 17.5% in 1998 to 30% in 2010. In the first cycle of secondary education, the
Government intends to maintain the transition rate from the primary education Grade 6 to Grade I of
secondary education at the current level of 50%. It is envisaged that the percentage of students in private

secondary schools would increase from 7% in 1998 to 15% by 2010. The number of students in the VTE
is expected to increase from 1,682 in 1998 to 6,600 by 2010. The Government plans to control the
enrollment in public university from 9,805 in 1998 to 7,500 in 2010.

Using the Government macro-financial framework and its projections and policy objectives as a base
scenario, sensitivity analysis was conducted with different assumptions for the key indicators. First, on the
financing side, sensitivity was analyzed with regard to the annual GDP growth rate and the percentage of
education budget in the total public finance.

The balance estimated in the proposed ESDP (base scenario) is negligible, approximately 140 million UM
(less than 1% of the revenue) in 2010. In the second scenario with the GDP annual growth rate of 5%, the
balance between the revenue and recurrent cost would increase to UM -497 million, 3% of the revenue. In
the third scenario, if the annual GDP growth rate remains 4%, the balance in 2010 is estimated at UM -819
million, or 6% of the revenue. The fiscal sensitivity of GDP growth rate is relatively low as the teachers
salary is linked to per-capita GDP. One percent decrease in the GDP growth rate would lead to an increase
of approximately 330 million UM (2% of the revenue) of the financial gap. However, even if the country
maintains a GDP annual growth rate of 6%, if the public finance for education is kept at 13% through
- 73 -



2010, the balance would increase to -3817 million UM (28% of the revenue) as shown in scenario 5.
Therefore, the financial balance is much more sensitive to public resource allocation to education than to
the annual GDP growth rate. However, given the Government's conmnitment to the education sector for the
next ten years, the risk would not be a major one.
Sensitivity of some of the key policy decision indicators were also analyzed: primary teacher salary,
transition rate from primary to secondary, transition rate from the 3rd to newly created 4th year of the
secondary education, and the number of intake in lyc&es.

As shown in Scenario 6, if the ratio of teacher salary to per capita GDP is kept at the current level of 5.1
through 2010, the balance between the revenue and the recurrent cost would be UMM -891 million (6% of
the revenue). Ten percentage points increase in the transition rate from primary to secondary education
would lead to a balance of -860 million UM (5% of the revenue). The change in the transition rate of 3rd
year to 4th year of the first cycle of secondary school would lead to a less significant financial gap, an
increase from 50% to 70% would result in an increase of $167 million UM (less than 1% of the revenue).
Lastly, if the intake of the lyc6e increases from 9,000 in 1998 to 10,000 by 2010 (the policy is to reduce to
6,500 by 2010), there would be a substantial financial gap of 891 million UM in the recurrent cost.
6. Role of the Public Sector
Public intervention in the ESDP is justified on many grounds. First, investment in the education sector has
externalities on health, population, participation, governance, etc. (there is enough global research to show
the social return of education). Second, from the equity perspective, the state has the obligation to ensure
that every child has access to good quality basic education. Third, there is an agreement in the HIPC
initiative to invest more in education as the public finance restructuring is coming to an end.
Nevertheless, the nature and the degree of public intervention in the education sector in Mauritania need to
change in the long-term. Currently, the Government is the "provider" of the service with weak management
capacity, but eventually it would be desirable to shift its role to quality monitoring and facilitation of the
services to be provided. At present, the role of the private sector in the provision of educational services is
very limited, but this should change as the demand for education increases and diversifies. The ESDP has
the policy objective to increase the participation of the private sector in the design and the delivery of
educational services, especially at secondary, TVT, and tertiary levels. Public-private and school-business
partnerships in education will be encouraged through the development of an institutional framework and
incentive mechanisms for private participation. These mechanisms will include funds to promote

7. Cost-effectiveness analysis
The sector study (Le systeme educatifmauritanien: elements d 'analyse pour instruire des politiques
nouvelles, May 2000) carried out a number of cost-effectiveness analyses to better understand the relations
between school pedagogic and organizational structure, availability of educational inputs, and the
performance of schools. The study was conducted on a sample 429 schools for which adequate
information existed, from a total number of 2,656 schools. This sample had some methodological
deficiencies: the average school size in the sample was larger than the national average and a few regions
were over-represented. However, the sample included a large variety of school types in terms of
endowment, pedagogic styles, organizational structures, and academic performance, enabling the analysis
of the relation between those factors. School performance was measured by results in the primary
education completion exam (CEF). The average pass rate in the CEF was 37% for all schools in the
sample, with a very high standard deviation (26%).

Analyzing the effect of class size, student-teacher ratio, single/multigrade teaching and double shifts, it
appears that double shifting has a significant negative impact on the success rate of the Primary Education
Certificate exam, while the size and the significance of the multigrade teaching coefficient seems to indicate
that this type of school organization has no noticeable impact on school performance. On the other hand,
both the student per teacher ratio and the class size are associated with lower school performance. This
- 75 -



result was anticipated given that the average class size was 47.4 (with a standard deviation of 21) and the
average student per teacher ration was 51.8 (standard deviation 25,) which are both relatively high. A
difference of 10 students more per class is associated with a 3% decrease in the results in the CEF.
Another noticeable result was the apparent weak impact of teachers formal qualification. The teacher body
is very diverse. About 90% of the teachers are fully qualified, 9% are partially qualified (instituteurs
adjoints) and 1% non qualified. However, in some schools, as many as 20% of the teachers are either
partially qualified or unqualified. The percentage of the variance explained suggests that the composition
of the teacher body did not have a large effect on school performance. However, paradoxically the
existence of partially qualified teachers and French-speaking teachers appear to have a positive and
significant effect.

Finally, the examination of the availability of teaching-leaming materials and school environment shows
that the availability of more than 4 teaching-learning materials have a positive effect on the result of
Primary Education Certificate exam. However, it is important to mention that due to extreme shortages,
textbooks were not part of the package of teaching and learning material that was considered. The school
database contains information only on the existence of small school materials (such as rulers and boxes of
small weights), as well as the existence of facilities such as latrines, canteens and playgrounds. With
regard to the availability of small pedagogic materials, only the best endowed schools have significantly
better results. These schools represent 14% of the sample, while 60% of school in the sample have no
pedagogic materials at all. Similarly, the results are positively correlated with the condition of the school
building, the existence of a canteen and the existence of other facilities. The consideration of all the above
elements simultaneously (model not shown) confirms all the above findings, except the positive influence of
the partially qualified teacher. The positive influence of the French-speaking teachers is confirmed.
Despite the data limitations and methodological imperfections (particularly the fact that there was no
control of the students' socio-economic background), this analysis draws attention to a few interesting facts.
First, many of the findings are coherent with usual research findings. Second, they tend to support the
strategies and policies on which the ESDP was based, particularly the emphasis on teacher in-service
training to enhance their French language capability, the provision of pedagogic materials, the retrofitting
of schools with latrines and water, the planned slight decrease of average class size and teacher /per student
ratios, the use of multigrade classes, the limited recourse to double shifting and the emphasis on school
maintenance.

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
MAURITANIA: Education Sector Development Program
Procurement
General
1.    The Mauritanian procurement Code was prepared in 1993 and will be revised on the basis of the
recommendations of the CPAR, which was carried out in February 1999. In the event that national
procurement laws and procedures conflict with the IDA Guidelines for procurement, the Mauritanian
procurement code permits IDA procedures to take precedence over any contrary provisions in national law
and regulations.
2.    The 1999 CPAR includes recommendations to: (i) clarify the role of the Ministry in charge of
Public Works as regards its role of Maitre d 'Ouvrage for large works and Maitre d'Oeuvre for small
works, (ii) review the mandates of the Central Tender Board (CTB) and the Departmental Tender Board
(DTB) to allow the CTB to monitor DTB's performances; (iii) open publicly and simultaneously technical
and financial offers for works and goods; (iv) disclose the evaluation criteria in the bid documents, (v)
include the obligation of interets moratoires in the Code, and (vi) state that all imports under public
contracts will be subject to pre-boarding inspection.
3.    An IDF Grant was provided in 1998 to support modernization of the public procurement system
and to help the public procurement reform. This grant, managed by the MAED, aims at: (i) reinforcing
MAED's institutional capacity to support executing agencies in preparing and updating their procurement
plans and to monitor their implementation; (ii) reinforcing the CTB capacity to play its new role and to
develop its monitoring services; (iii) supporting the modemization of the public procurement law and
related by-laws; and (iv) helping the Government develop and implement a training program for
procurement staff.
Guidelines
4.    Procurement of goods and works financed by IDA will be carried out in accordance with the
Guidelines for procurement under IBRD loans and IDA credits published in 1995 and updated in
January and August 1996 and in September 1997 and January 1999. The Bank's standard bidding
documents for goods and civil works and the Standard Bid Evaluation Forms will be used. National
Competitive Bidding (NCB) advertised locally will be carried out in accordance with Mauritania's
procurement laws and regulation, acceptable to IDA, provided that: (i) bids are advertised in national
newspapers with a wide circulation; (ii) the bid document clearly explains the bid evaluation, award criteria
and bidder qualification; (iii) bidders are given adequate response time to prepare and submit bids
(minimum four weeks); (iv) technical and financial bids are publicly and simultaneously opened; (v) bids
are awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder; (vi) no eligible bidder is precluded from participation,
regardless of nationality; (vii) no domestic preference margins are applicable to domestic manufacturers or
suppliers; (viii) prior to issuing the first call for bids, a draft standard bidding document will be submitted
to and found acceptable by IDA. NCB managed by AMEXTIPE will be based on the Agency's standard
bidding documents for goods and civil works, recently approved by IDA (February 2001).
5.    The aggregate values for NCB and other non-ICB procurement methods for goods and works are
limitative and cannot be exceeded without the prior no-objection of the Bank. The DPEF will monitor such
- 79 -



procurement in order to alert the Bank in a timely manner when this may occur.
6.    Consultant services contracts financed by IDA will be procured in accordance with the Guidelines
for the Selection of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers published in January 1997 and updated in
September 1997 and January 1999. The Bank's Standard Request for Proposals: Selection of
Consultants, dated July 1997 and revised April 1998 and July 1999 and forms of contracts (lump-sum,
time based, and/or simplified contracts for short-term assignments and individual consultants) as well as
the Sample Form of Evaluation Report for Selection of Consultants will be used. Simplified contracts will
be used for short-term assignments, not exceeding six months, carried out by firms or individual
consultants.
Advertising
7.    A General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be prepared and published, following Board approval,
in the United Nations Development Business, listing all works contracts above US$250,000 equivalent,
goods contracts above US$100,000 equivalent, and large contracts for consultant services (above
US$100,000 equivalent), to obtain expressions of interest and to draw up a roster of reliable firms that will
make up the shortlists.
8.    The related bidding documents will not be released and neither will the shortlist of consultants be
prepared until eight weeks after the GPN has been published. The GPN will be updated annually for those
contracts still outstanding. A GPN will also be published in the national press for contracts to be awarded
under NCB. Specific Procurement Notices (SPNs) for goods and works will be advertised locally, and for
large contracts (ICB), intemationally. Sufficient time will be allowed to obtain the bid documents.
Procurement Implementation Arrangements
9.    Procurement activities for the first phase of the ESDP will be carried out by the Government for
the procurement financed by AfDB, IDA, IDB, and the 'Government budget, while bilateral donors, such as
FAC, intematiotial organizations, such as UNICEF, and NGOs, will maintain responsibility for
procurement of the contracts they finance.
10.   Procurement carried out by the Government will be handled by the following procurement
implementing agencies: (i) the existing DPEF, for the procurement of contracts of goods and services
financed by IDA, AfDB and IDB credits, and by the Government's counterparts to these credits and the
investment budget of the MEN; (ii) the DAFM, for all procurement financed under operating costs of the
MEN (except salaries); (iii) AMEXTIPE, by delegation from the MEN, for the procurement of works, with
the exception of primary classrooms and water supply facilities; and (iv) Communities for the procurement
of works and related furniture for primary schools financed by IDA and AfDB.
11.  The DPEF and DAFM work through the National Tender Board - Commission Centrale des
Marches (CCM), which is responsible for the procurement process for contracts exceeding 10 million UM
(US$40,000 equivalent); and through the Departmental Tender Board - Commission Departementale des
Marches (CDM) of their respective ministries for the procurement of contracts under this threshold but
exceeding I million UM (US$4,000 equivalent). The DPEF and DAFM prepare bidding documents but do
not award contracts. Awards are the responsibility of the CCM and the respective CDM. Contracts
exceeding 50 million UM (US$200,000 equivalent) must be approved by the Prime Minister in accordance
with national procurement procedures. These thresholds will be raised in the forthcoming revised code and
the maximum time allowed for clearances will be reduced. AMEXTIPE has its own procurement
- 80 -



commission. For IDA-financed contracts managed by AMEXTIPE and DPEF, the procurement process
(preparation of bidding documents, bid evaluation and award, contract management) will be carried out by
the agency itself and the relevant procurement commission, but liaison with IDA will be carried out through
the DPEF which will have the responsibility to monitor the whole procurement program.
Procurement Capacity Assessment, action plan, risk rating and thresholds
12.   A participatory procurement capacity assessment of the existing implementing agencies (DPEF,
DAFM, AMEXTIPE and Communities) was conducted during program preparation, with representatives
from the CTB-CCM, DPEF, DAFM and AMEXTIPE. The following four points emerged from this
assessment:
(a)    Strength and weaknesses of the four procurement agencies (DPEF, DAFM, AMEXTIPE and
communities) are as follows:
i. The DPEF has gained extensive experience in IDA and AfDB procurement procedures through
previous projects. It handled satisfactorily and simultaneously the IDA-supported General Education
Project (Cr. 2706-MAU) and Vocational Training Project (Cr. 2521-MAU). The unit is well
organized and has clearly defined procurement responsibilities and skilled staff. It has the capacity to
manage the Procurement Cycle well and has a very good record keeping system. However, DPEF
staffing is not sufficient to cope with: (i) the volume of contracts of the first phase of the ESDP which
is much larger than previous projects, as a consequence of the sector approach involving new
components such as higher education, school health, adult literacy and ECD; and (ii) the mandate to
assist in building the procurement capacity of the DAFM.
ii. The DAFM has a weak procurement capacity at present since recurrent budgets (aside from
personnel salaries) were very limited in the past, and procurement practices hardly ever involved open
competition. To cope with the significant increase in non-salary recurrent resources made available to
the MEN under ESDP for the purchase of educational goods related to the quality education objectives
(from 2,539 UM million in 1998 to 4,518 UM million in 2005); a strong DAFM's procurement
capacity needs to be built, almost from scratch. This capacity building is one of the key objectives of
the first phase of the ESDP supported by IDA's APL. Transfer to the MEN's DAFM of the
procurement activities presently handled by the MAED's DPEF is expected to take place during the
second phase of the ESDP, subject to a positive assessment of the capacity built in the DAFM during
the first phase.
iii. AMEXTIPE has good experience in IDA procurement procedures and adequate staffing to
manage contracts for the small works in Nouakchott and other cities. AMEXTIPE will be contracted
for the management of works in regional and provincial capitals. However the Agency is still weak
because of the large number of new staff who need to become procurement proficient. This weakness is
to be addressed through the parallel Urban Development Program (UDP) under preparation, which
includes an action plan for procurement training ofAMEXTIPE's staff before UDP credit
effectiveness, scheduled before the end of 2001.
iv. Communities will be handling procurement of goods and works under the school construction
program financed by IDA and AfDB. Communities developed the capacity to carry out this type of
procurement during the implementation of the Education III and V projects (financed by IDA and
l'Agence Franqaise de Developpement) when they built more than 2,500 classrooms with technical
assistance provided by three engineers and their assistants under contracts with the DPEF. A technical
- 81 -



evaluation of the current program shows that the quality of work was acceptable while the costs were
lower than comparable construction managed by other agencies in the country and even in other West
African countries. The operation manual for this component was revised during the program
preparation to include specific community-based procurement procedures, acceptable to IDA. Specific
assistance will continue to be provided to communities by the pool of engineers and assistants under the
previous contractual arrangements with the DPEF. This assistance will include information and
training of communities on community-based procurement.
(b)    Action plan to build procurement capacity. On the basis of the procurement capacity assessment,
an action plan has been incorporated into the program to build the long-term capacity of the MEN to
administer procurement. The objective is to bring the DAFM to full capacity during the first phase of the
ESDP while donor-financed procurement will be handled by the DPEF. During the second phase, all
procurement activities will be carried out by the DAFM. With respect to DAFM, the actions cover:
organization, staffing, training, equipment, and record keeping. These activities are detailed in a specific
module (GS2) of the PIP. With respect to DPEF, the actions cover: (i) recruitment and training of two
additional procurement specialists, and (ii) support to the above-mentioned capacity building of the DAFM.
The action plan for DPEF, which is essential for program implementation and should be in place before
procurement starts, is detailed in a specific action plan at the end of the procurement section of this annex.
Measures to strengthen the capacity of AMEXTIPE is incorporated in parallel Bank support (UDP).
(c)    Risk rating. During the first phase of ESDP, the bulk of the donor-financed procurement (about
80%) will be handled by the DPEF, which has a fair record in handling past donor-financed procurement.
Considering the immediate action plan to upgrade its capacity to the level required by ESDP, the DPEF
falls in the average-risk zone. AMEXTIPE, which will manage the civil works contracts with the
exception of wells and primary classrooms (representing 50% of the donor-financed construction in the first
phase), also have a fair past record and assessment rating. Given the parallel strengthening measures, the
Agency also falls into the average risk zone. According to its participatory assessment, the DAFM falls
into the high-risk zone, but a sub-component of the ESDP management component is specifically
addressing this issue. Given the communities' ten years' experience in community-based procurement
arrangements for primary classroom construction, they fall into low-risk zone. Based on the above, the
overall assessment of risk is average.
(d)    Threshold for prior reviews. Based on the above-mentioned risk rating and the past experience with
education projects in other countries, the thresholds for prior review will be set up, for the first phase of the
ESDP, as shown in Table B. The long-term objective of the ESDP is to strengthen the capacity of all
agencies and to move them gradually to the low-risk category. The second phase of the program may
consider raising these thresholds if the agencies meet specific performance indicators stated in the
Implementation Manual. The post-review will be applied to at least one in ten contracts not subject to prior
review.
Program Procurement Plan (PPP)
13.   The Borrower has prepared a draft detailed procurement plan for the first four-year phase of the
program, showing the step-by-step procedures for procurement, contract packages for goods, works and
consultant services, and the estimated costs for each package, procurement/selection method, and the
activities which follow procurement until completion. The PPP will cover Govemment-managed
procurement regardless of the origin of funds (IDA, AfDB, BCI, and recurrent budget). The procurement
plan, acceptable by the Bank, was submitted at negotiations. By November of each year, the DPEF will
submit to IDA for its non-objection, an updated version of the PPP with the actual procurement activities
- 82 -



for the past year and revisions of the plan for the following years.
Procurement phases                          Maximum number of weeks
Preparation of bidding documents            6 weeks - 3 weeks for small and community-based

Submission of bids by bidders               generally 8 weeks for ICB/NCB
3 weeks for small and community based contracts
Bid Evaluation, award and signature         8 weeks
14.   A draft Project Implementation Plan (PIP) -- Manuel d 'Execution - was developed during project
preparation on the basis of the draft Project Implementation Plan Guidelines issued in 1999 by the Project
Management Thematic Group of the Bank. The PIP is organized in 19 modules corresponding to
sub-components, plus specific Manuals of Procedures governing each grant mechanism (below referred in
para 28) including the community-based primary construction program. Each PIP module includes the
specific procurement section for the module, specific responsibilities for commitment and implementation,
and identifies the risks that need to be minimized. The Manual of Procedures for the community-based
primary construction program was deemed satisfactory to the Bank at project appraisal subject to minor
improvements which were done before negotiations. The 19 modules of the PIP were reviewed at
negotiations and Bank's comments provided to the borrower. Submission of the final version of the PIP is
a condition of effectiveness. Submission of the Manuals of Procedures satisfactory to the Bank, for all
grants mechanism, with the exception of the Manual goveming the community-based construction program,
is a condition of disbursement for these grants.
15.   Manuel des Procedures Administratives, Financieres et Comptables. The borrower has recruited
a consultant to prepare this Manual. Offers will be opened on august 2001 and the consultant work will
start in September 2001. This Manual will reiterate the procurement arrangements described in this Annex.
Submission of the Manual of Administrative, Financial and Accounting Procedures, acceptable to IDA is a
condition of effectiveness.
Works
16.    ESDP program. During the first phase of the ESDP (2001-2005), the construction program
totaling US$67.67 million equivalent (all sources of funds included) encompasses: (a) ECD: construction of
a central ECD training center and construction/rehabilitation of 13 regional training centers, (b) primary
education: (i) the primary school building program detailed in para. 17 below, and (ii) expansion of the ENI
in Nouakchott; (c) lower secondary education: construction of 36 new small-scale colleges mainly in
villages, and of 250 classrooms, 28 administrative blocs, 135 computer rooms, about 60 libraries and
laboratories, and 80 sanitation blocs in existing schools; rehabilitation of 260 classrooms and about 350
sanitation blocs; (d) upper secondary: construction of 50 laboratories, 15 libraries and 70 computer rooms
and as many sanitation blocs; rehabilitation of 100 classrooms and 35 sanitation blocs; (e) vocational
training: rehabilitation and expansion of existing training centers; construction of the office-building of the
new INP-FTP; (f) higher education: rehabilitation/expansion of the CUR in Rosso; (g) management:
construction of 29 IDENs and 2 DRENs and expansion of 8 DREFs, construction of an administrative
building for Examination Offices; and rehabilitation of the MEN central offices. The ESDP construction
program will be supported by IDA, among other donors.
17.    The primary school building program of the ESDP totalling US$19.81 million equivalent includes
(all sources of funds): (i) construction of about 2,730 classrooms as follows: 1,800 small schools
- 83 -



comprising up to 3 classrooms will be built as a matter of priority in order to deliver 6 grades of education
through multigrade teaching; and 930 dilapidated sub-standard classrooms, built with non-permanent
materials, will be reconstructed; (ii) rehabilitation of 460 classrooms; (iii) completion of all new
3-classroom schools and retrofitting of existing ones with latrines (about 1,340), office-storage blocs
(about 1,100), fencing (about 800), and water supply facilities (about 1,000). With the exception of the
provision of water to schools, which will be executed by the Direction de l'Hydraulique (US$1.07 million
equivalent), the implementation of the school-building program will be delegated to communities through
the community-based construction program detailed in para 26(a) below (for a total of US$17.74 million
equivalent).
Contracts for Works supported by IDA (total contracts equivalent to US$11.85 million)
18.    Scope. Works financed under the proposed IDA credit will comprise: (a) ECD: central and
regional training centers, (b) primarv education: water supply to 500 schools; (c) lower secondary
education: construction of 16 new small colleges, 87 classrooms and computer rooms, 28 administrative
blocs, and rehabilitation of 128 existing classrooms and 355 existing sanitation blocs; (d) upper secondary:
rehabilitation of 100 classrooms and 35 sanitation blocs; (e) vocational training: rehabilitation of 16
existing vocational training centers and construction of the office-building for the new INP-FTP; (f)
management: construction of 17 IDENs and 2 DRENs and expansion of 8 DREFs to accommodate
DRENs, construction of an Examination Office, and rehabilitation of the MEN central office building. The
remainder of the construction program is expected to be financed by the Govermment, mainly from the
additional resources provided by the HIPC initiative, and by other donors, mainly AfDB and IDB.
19.    Procurement Methods. Civil works contracts exceeding US$250,000 equivalent will be procured
through International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Contracts below this threshold will be procured under
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) up to an aggregate amnount of US$ 10.20 million equivalent.
Contracts for school construction/rehabilitation of secondary schools, training centers, and administrative
offices scattered throughout the country, will be procured by a Contract Management Agency (CMA), the
AMEXTIPE. The CMA will apply provisions of schedule 3 of the Development Credit Agreement (DCA)
for procurement procedures. Standard Bidding Documents for NCB set up in the most recent AMEXTIPE
Procedures Manual (dated June 2000), which have been found acceptable to IDA will be used for the
delegated sub-program. Any changes and revisions in the Procedures Manual will be subject to IDA prior
review. Works for water supply to rural schools will be executed by the Direction de l'Hydraulique
through force account for a maximum total amount of US$1.07 million equivalent under an Agreement
with the DPEF. Contracts for small works estimated to cost less than US$30,000 equivalent per contract,
up to an aggregate amount of US$0.57 million equivalent, may be procured under lump-sum fixed-priced
contracts awarded on the basis of written quotations from three reputable small local contractors. The
invitation shall include a detailed description of the works, basic specifications, the required completion
period, a basic form of agreement acceptable to IDA, and relevant drawings when applicable. The award
will be made to the contractor whose submission is substantially acceptable, who offers the lowest price
quotation for the required work, and has the experience and resources to complete the contract successfully.
The contracts will mostly be for works related to small construction and rehabilitation, such as ECD
centers and rehabilitation of existing facilities in remote areas. The above-mentioned aggregate value limits
for NCB and small works cannot be exceeded without prior IDA non-objection. The DPEF will maintain a
monitoring system, including contracts managed by AMEXTIPE to alert the Bank when these limits may
be exceeded and will ask the Bank for advice beforehand.

Goods
20.   During the first phase of the ESDP (2001-2005), goods to be procured for the program (all sources
of funds) total US$51.66 million equivalent.
Contracts for goods supported by IDA (total contracts equivalent to US$14.22 million)
21.   Scope. Goods to be financed under the IDA credit will include: (i) furniture for new and
rehabilitated facilities; (ii) office equipment: computers, photocopiers, and other equipment for the existing
and new offices; (iii) textbooks, instructional materials and library books for primary and secondary
schools, University and teacher training institutes, including transportation services for the goods; (iv)
pedagogic materials for ECD; (v) computers for secondary schools; (vi) equipment for laboratories and
science teaching in secondary and higher education; (vii) retrofitting the secondary schools with adequate
furniture; (viii) technical equipment for renovated vocational training centers; (ix) drugs and supplementary
nutrients; (x) information systems (including MIS and GIS software and hardware) for the entire education
sector; and (xi) equipment for monitoring and supervision: vehicles and spare parts for the management
units at the central and decentralized levels of the MEN and for the new INP-FTP.
22.   Procurement methods. Goods to be financed under the IDA credit will be grouped into packages of
at least US$100,000 equivalent to be procured through International Competitive Bidding in accordance
with the World Bank's Guidelines. Information Systems will be procured through ICB on the basis of the
Bank's Standard Bidding Document entitled: Supply and Installation of Information Systems published in
February 1999. Contracts for goods that have to be purchased on an annual basis, and for other goods and
equipment, available on the local market at a competitive price, with a unit value exceeding US$30,000
equivalent and which cannot be grouped together into packages exceeding US$100,000 equivalent and
which are unlikely to be of interest to foreign suppliers because of their small size and the geographical
dispersion of the delivery points, will be awarded on the basis of National Competitive Bidding in
accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.39 million equivalent.
Small quantities of drugs and micronutrients estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent per
contract, will be procured from United Nation Agencies (WHO or UNICEF) up to an aggregate amount of
US$0.37 million equivalent. International Shopping will be used for off-the-shelf goods that cannot be
grouped into lots of US$100,000 equivalent, and are not available on the local market, such as books and
instructional materials, up to an aggregate amount of US$0.74 million equivalent. Small quantities of
off-the-shelf goods such as office supplies, consumable materials and spare parts considered to be standard
items locally available, and which cannot be grouped together into packages of at least US$30,000
equivalent, will be purchased through National Shopping provided that the aggregate amount of such
contracts does not exceed US$0.31  million equivalent. National and International Shopping solicitations
will: (a) be issued in writing to at least three reputable suppliers; (b) include specifications and, if goods are
not immediately available, the delivery time; (c) give the estimated cost, including cost of inland
transportation and insurance; (d) be opened at the same time for evaluation; and (e) in the case of
International Shopping, be solicited from at least three suppliers in two different countries. The
above-mentioned aggregate value limits for NCB, International and National Shopping are limitative and
cannot be exceeded without prior IDA non-objection. The DPEF will maintain a tracking system to alert
the Bank when these limits may be exceeded and will ask the Bank for advice beforehand.
Consultant services (US$ 21.22 million equivalent)
23.   Consulting services for the PNDSE will be mainly financed by: (i) the French Cooperation which
- 85 -



has a large network of technical assistance across MEN's subsectors; (ii) AfDB and IDB for services
related to the investment program they support; (iii) UNICEF for the literacy and Mahadras component;
and (iii) IDA for consulting services necessaxy to implement successfully the ESDP and that are not
provided by other partners.
Contracts for consultant services supported by IDA (total contracts US$7.91 million equivalent)
24.    Scope. IDA-financed consultant services will be for: (a) preparation of engineering designs for
works, bid documents and works supervision; (b) studies for: (i) textbook editing policy; (ii) student flow
regulation in the system; (iii) maintenance policy; (iv) vocational training policy; (v) market demand for
higher education; causes of student drop out and repetition in higher education; (vi) conception of
evaluation instruments; (vii) creation of a small/efficient labor market observatory; and (viii) design of the
various grant mechanisms including operational manuals; (c) technical assistance for: (i) Early Childhood
planning, implementation, testing and development; (ii) pre-service and in-service teacher training at the
primary and secondary levels; (iii) curricula development; (iv) textbook manuscript development; (v)
teacher career management; and (vi) information system (MIS-GIS) development; (d) twinning
arrangements with intemational institutions for knowledge transfer and technical assistance in the areas of:
(i) student learning assessment; (ii) primary curriculum and textbook conception; (iii) secondary curriculum
development; (iv) "recherche-action" development; (v) development and implementation of new TVT
modules; and (vi) assessment of the existing higher education 'fili&res" and development of new
professionally oriented ones, and Faculty management under Agreements between Faculties and MEN; (e)
IEC activities related to ECD, primary education, literacy and vocational training; (f) capacity building for
school management; (g) training for managers, teachers and trainers; (h) project management including
procurement and accounting specialists; and (i) technical and financial audits.
25.   Procurement methods. The standard method of selection will be competition among qualified firms
short-listed on the basis of replies to a Request for Expression of Interest, based on the Quality-and
Cost-Based Selection (QCBS). As much as practicable, training institutions will be selected on the
Consultant's Qualification (CQ) method. For the financial audit contract (of a standard nature) the
Least-Cost Selection will be the most appropriate method. Services of trainers, lecturers and researchers,
small studies, as well as professional staff for the implementation units, that can be provided by Individual
Consultants (estimated to cost less than US$ 50,000 equivalent per contract and up to aggregate amount of
US$ 1,87 million equivalent), will be selected through comparison of their qualifications for the assignment,
on the basis of CVs and references, among those expressing interest in the assignment or approached
directly, in accordance with part V of the Guidelines. When the estimated amount is greater than
US$200,000 equivalent, a Request for Expression of Interest will be published in a national newspaper and
in the UN Development Business. Short lists of consultants for contracts estimated under US$ 100,000
equivalent may comprise only national consultant firms in accordance with section 2.7 of the Consultant
Guidelines, provided that a sufficient number of qualified firms (at least three) are available at competitive
costs, and foreign consultants who have expressed interest are not excluded. Contracts with UN agencies
will be in accordance with paragraphs 3.13 and 3.15 of the Guidelines. For training abroad and in-country,
the training program -- containing names of candidates, cost estimates, content of courses, periods of
training, institution selection -- will be reviewed by IDA annually. Single-source selection will be used
exceptionally in the cases mentioned in para. 26 below.
26.    Single-source selection is proposed by the Government for exceptional use in accordance with
paragraphs 3.8-3.11 of the Guidelines for Consultants mainly for reasons of continuity between the
Education V and ESDP projects, for the following contracts: (a) BIEF (Belgium) to provide technical
- 86 -



assistance to the MEN for the experimentation of the new primary and secondary curricula and programs
and support to textbook preparation, because this institution has successfully assisted, under Education V,
the development of these new curricula and textbooks which needs to be immediately followed by the
experimentation; the amount of the contract will be less than the equivalent of US$650,000; (b) NS21
(Canada) to provide technical assistance to the MEN for the support to multigrade teaching because this
assignment is the direct continuation of previous satisfactory support during Education V for a maximumn
amount of US$ 200,000; (c) contract management for civil works will be delegated to AMEXTIPE (for a
contract amount less than US$550,000 equivalent), because if these services performed by an international
firm they would be more expensive, and there is no other local firm with such expertise in contract
management; (d) contracts with the national team of 3 engineers, 3 assistants and 6 drivers (Mauritania)
who successfully assisted communities for the community-based primary classroom construction during the
Education V project will be renewed under ESDP for reason of continuity, with a maximum amount of
US$400,000 equivalent for all team contracts; and (e) contract with the national management team of the
DPEF which has successfully managed previous projects, for reasons of continuity, for a maximum amount
of US$670,000 equivalent.
27.   Grants (total US$24.86 million).
Under the ESDP, the existing grant mechanism for community-based school construction will be continued
with financing from AfDB and IDA. In addition, 6 new grant mechanisms will be created: the School
Performance and Improvement Grants (SPIG); the Private Sector Education Grants (PSEG); the Technical
and Vocational Training Fund (TVTF); the ECD support Grants (ECDG); The Non Formal Education
Grant (NFEG), and the Research Support Grant (RSG).
28.   Grants supported by IDA (total grants US$20.48 million)
(a)    Community-based primary school construction (US$17.74 million equivalent). Under ESDP the
MEN will delegate to communities the primary school construction financed by AfDB and IDA. This
grant-mechanism was successfully set up in 1989 under the Education III project and was continued during
the Education V project. Communities have already built more than 2,500 classrooms. IDA-financed grants
(US$14.42 million equivalent) will support: the construction and furnishing of 1,830 new classrooms and
rehabilitation of 230. Priority will be given to the completion of schools by promoting 3-classroom
multigrade schools, equipping new and retrofitting existing schools with latrines (total 620) and office
storages (about 300). The standard classroom design is simple and the costs are low (about US$5,000 per
classroom). The Government provides grants to communities representing 70% of the estimated cost for
classrooms and 100% for latrines, office-storage bloc, furniture and fencing. Individual grants do not
exceed US$30,000 equivalent. Government's and Communities' responsibilities are embodied in a
contractual agreement signed before works start. Payments from the grants will be made by the DPEF to
the conmnunities in tranches (installments) on the basis of works completed and technically certified by the
DPEF's engineers. Arrangements for the implementation of this grant mechanism are described in the
specific module of the Manual of Procedures called: Manuel de Procedures - Appui aux Collectivites pour
la Construction d'Infrastructures de Base. This Manual is currently operational and is acceptable to IDA.
It was revised during project preparation to incorporate additional detailed community-based procurement
procedures derived from the WB procurement and disbursement manualfor projects with community
participation, issued November 1, 1995. The Government will submit to the Bank the final version of the
revised module of the Manual of Procedures for review.
(b)    School Performance and Improvement Grants - SPIG (US$ 1.1 million equivalent). The ESDP
intends to test decentralized mechanisms for school-based improvement through allocation of two types of
- 87 -



grants depending on the school level (primary or secondary). Grants will be provided by the DPEF to
eligible schools through sub-project Agreements awarded by an Evaluation Committee on a competitive
basis. Individual grants will not exceed US$1,200 and US$2,000 for primary and secondary schools,
respectively. The flow of funds, implementation and accounting arrangements will be governed by a
specific module of the Manual of Procedures which will include detailed description of: (i) procedures for
preparation and submission of sub-project by potential beneficiaries; (ii) eligibility criteria; (iii) appraisal
and approval procedure; (iv) flow of funds chart and disbursement mechanisms; (v) monitoring and
evaluation system including benchmarks and performance indicators based on a planned disbursement
schedule; and (vi) technical and financial audit. Submission by the Borrower of the specific module of the
Manual of Procedures for the management of the SPIG is a condition of disbursement of funds under this
category.
(c)    Private Sector Education Grants - PSEG (US$1.70 million equivalent). The PSEG intends to
promote the private education sector by providing grants to private institutions. Grants will be provided by
the DPEF to eligible private education providers through sub-project Agreements awarded by an
Evaluation Committee on the basis of eligibility criteria defined in the Manual of Procedures. Individual
grants will not exceed US$20,000 equivalent. The flow of funds, implementation and accounting
arrangements will be governed by a specific module of the Manual of Procedures which will include
detailed description of: (i) procedures for preparation and submission of sub-project by potential
beneficiaries; (ii) eligibility criteria; (iii) appraisal and approval procedure; (iv) flow of funds chart and
disbursement mechanisms; (v) monitoring and evaluation system including benchmarks and performance
indicators based on a planned disbursement schedule; (vi) technical and financial audit. Submission by the
Borrower of the specific module of the Manual of Procedures for the management of the PSEG, detailing
procedures for elaboration, submission, appraisal, implementation, financing and evaluation of
sub-projects, acceptable to IDA, is a condition of disbursement of funds under this category.
(d)    The Technical and Vocational Training Fund - (TVTF) (US$1.7 million equivalent) will be created
to provide grants to TVT centers and private enterprises as a mechanism to test a new method to finance
in-service training and apprenticeship mechanisms. Sub-projects proposed by enterprises and training
centers will be of two types: (a) in-Service training in enterprise and (b) apprenticeship dual training.
Individual grants will be provided on a matching basis with the beneficiaries' participation amounting to no
less than 20% of the estimated cost of the sub-project. The grants will be financed by the Government and
IDA on an equal basis (maximum 40% each). Both resources will be managed by DPEF and awarded to
eligible beneficiaries by the Fund's Board whose secretariat will be entrusted to the INP-FTP(MEN). At
start-up, grants will not exceed US$5,000 equivalent for type (a) and US$7,000 equivalent for type (b).
This threshold may be reviewed during annual joint reviews according to experience. Submission by the
Borrower of the specific module of the Manual of Procedures for the management of the TVTF detailing
procedures for elaboration, submission, appraisal, implementation, financing and evaluation of
sub-projects, acceptable to IDA, is a condition of disbursement of funds under this category.
(e)    The ECD Support Grants - (ECDG) (US$0.25 million equivalent) will be created and tested to
provide grant support to communities which have developed an ECD center, with a view to helping them
provide better remuneration for the person in charge of the center and the procurement of small equipment
to facilitate access to such centers. The overall objective is to improve the quality and the stability of the
Centers' personnel hired by the communities. Grants will be channeled by the DPEF and awarded to
eligible communities by an Evaluation Committee on the basis of the criteria defined in a specific module of
the Manual of Procedures. The amount of individual grants will not exceed US$ 1,000 equivalent.
Submission by the Borrower of the specific module of the Manual of Procedures for the management of the
ECDG, acceptable to iDA, is a condition of disbursement of funds under this category.

(f)    The Non Formal Education Grant - (NFEG) (US$0.60 million equivalent). The IDA credit will
finance grants to communities for two different activities: (i) improving Koranic education provided in
mahadras, to include science and language training, through pairing arrangements (one mahadra is paired
with the neighboring formal school) successfully experimented by UNICEF; (ii) testing a new approach for
providing functional literacy programs to demanding communities through grants to private literacy
providers, mainly NGOs, on the basis of sub-projects submitted by literacy providers. Submission by the
Borrower of a specific module in the Manual of Procedures for the management of the NFEG, detailing
procedures for submission, appraisal, implementation, financing and evaluation of sub-projects, acceptable
to IDA, is a condition of disbursement of fuids under this category.
(g)    The Research Support Fund - (RSF) (US$0.80 million equivalent). The IDA credit will finance
university research sub-projects proposed by researchers on a 50/50 matching basis. Research sub-projects
will be prepared and submitted by individual researchers or groups. The Directorate of Higher Education
will be responsible for organizing the grant mechanism. Grants will be awarded by a scientific committee to
researchers from the public and private sector of higher education for eligible research sub-projects on the
basis of criteria spelled out in the Manual of Procedures. The DPEF will be responsible to finance the
research sub-projects to which grants have been awarded. Individual grants will not exceed US$15,000
equivalent. This threshold may be reviewed during the annual review meetings based on actual results.
Submission by the Borrower of the specific module of the Manual of Procedures for the management of the
RSF detailing procedures for elaboration, submission, appraisal, implementation, financing and evaluation
of sub-projects, acceptable to IDA, is a condition of disbursement of funds under this category.

Prior review thresholds (Table B)
29.    Prior review thresholds were detenrined on the basis of the procurement capacity assessment.
The review procedures followed will be in accordance with the Appendix I (Review by the Bank) of both
procurement Guidelines. Contracts not subject to prior review will be selectively reviewed during project
implementation. In the event of increases in works contracts of more than 15% of the original price, the
Borrower must specify the reasons and request the Bank's non-objection prior to proceeding with the
additional works.
30. Civil works contracts exceeding the equivalent of US$250,000 and the five first contracts of less than
US$250,000 will be subject to prior review by IDA. For all contracts for works for which there are less
than three bidders, or for any recommendation not to select the lowest evaluated bid, the award proposal
will be submitted to IDA for approval prior to notifying the winning bidder. All other contracts will be
subject to post review by IDA during supervision missions and by auditors.
31.   Goods contracts for an amount exceeding the equivalent of US$100,000 will be subject to prior
review by IDA. All other contracts will be subject to post review during supervision missions and by
auditors.
32.   All contracts with consulting firms exceeding US$100,000 equivalent and with individuals
consultants exceeding US$30,000 equivalent will be subject to prior review. Terms of Reference for all
contracts, single-source hiring, assignments of a critical nature (as determined by IDA, like the financial
audit) will be subject to prior review. For QCBS selection of consultants for contracts above
US$100,000, IDA will review the technical evaluation before opening of the financial proposals.
Procurement supervision and technical audit
33.   Procurement specialists will supervise all executing agencies every six months. During these
missions selective post review (1 out of 5 contracts) will be carried out for contracts awarded below the
ftresholds. AMEXTIPE activities will be subject to the half-year technical audit by qualified consultants,
selected through the competitive process agreed for consultant services.

Reinforcement of procurement capacities. Procurement capacity of the Sector will be strengthened by:
(i) reinforcing the procurement capacity of the DPEF by recruitment of two professional staff to be in place
before Credit effectiveness; (ii) reinforcing the procurement capacity of the DAFM; (iii) recruitment of
additional civil servants in the DAFM according to job descriptions included in the PIP; and (iv) organizing
the DAFM's and DPEF's procurement staff to work together so that training of DAFM staff by DPEF will
result in full DAFM procurement capacity built by the end of the first phase. The procurement section of
the procedure manual will include clear job descriptions and performance requirements of the procurement
staff, procurement monitoring and reporting arrangements and other processes related to the procurement
staff. The reinforcement of the procurement capacity of the DAFM is on of the objective of the project, and
is detailed in a specific module of the PIP (module GS2). The procurement team will also benefit from
support provided by the yearly technical and procurement audits. On the basis of the participative
procurement capacity assessment, an action plan for immediate procurement capacity reinforcement was
developed, its schedule was agreed during negotiations.

During negotiations, the Government provided IDA with: (i) a draft procurement plan for the four-year
program; (ii) an advance version of the Program Implementation Plan, organized by individual modules
for each component/subcomponent, each of the modules comprising a procurement section where the
relevant section of the program procurement plan will be restated. Submission by the Government of a
Manuel des Procedures Administratives, Financieres et Comptables for the program, including the section
on Procurement and the section on Accounting and Finance, and detailed job descriptions/term of
references and performance requirements of the accounting and procurement staff is a condition of
effectiveness. At negotiations, the Government provided assurances that: (i) it will use the Manuel des
Procedures Administratives, Financieres et Comptables and all its specific sections, together with Project
Implementation Plan and the specific Manuals of Procedures for the administration of grants (School
Improvement Grants; the Private Sector Education Grants; the Vocational Training support Grants; the

Disbursement
Allocation of credit proceeds (Table C)
I .    Disbursements of the IDA credit will be made for civil works, goods, consultant services and
training and operating expenses that are eligible for IDA financing. The credit will be disbursed over a
period of 48 months, taking into account that the credit's closing date will be May 31, 2006, corresponding
to six months after the project completion date. While operating under traditional disbursement procedures
all disbursements will be fully documented at the time of submission of withdrawal applications, except for
expenditures made against Statement of Expenditures (SOE). Once the project's financial management is
deemed satisfactory enough to fulfill all the requirements of the Project Management Reports (PMR)-based
disbursements, it is expected that traditional disbursement procedures for this project will be phased out.
The proposal for allocation of IDA Credit funds is given in Table C.
2.     The IDA Credit will be disbursed against the following categories:

The term "Operating costs" means: the incremental expenses incurred on account of Project implementation, management and
monitoring, including office supplies, administrative support, communications, utility services, travel and supervision costs, but
excluding salaries of officials of the Borrower's civil service.
Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):
3.     All replenishment or reimbursement applications will be submitted monthly or when the SA will be
reduced by one-third, whichever comes first. All replenishment applications will be fully documented
except for: (a) contracts of less than US$100,000 equivalent for goods; (b) contracts of less than
US$250,000 equivalent for works; (c) consulting services provided by individual consultants less than
- 96 -



US$30,000 equivalent; and (d) consulting services provide by consulting firns less than US$100,000
equivalent. SOE documentation will be retained by the DPEF and made available for review as requested
by auditors (including technical audits) and by the World Bank supervision missions.
Special account:
4.    Special Account under Traditional Disbursement Procedures. To facilitate disbursements, the
Government will open a Special Accounts at a commercial bank. The authorized allocation will be:
US$4.0 million equivalent. The authorized allocation will cover four months' eligible expenditures. Upon
effectiveness, an amount representing 50% of the authorized allocations will be deposited in the Special
Account until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Credit account plus the total amount of all
outstanding commitments entered into by the Association shall equal or exceed the equivalent of SDR
7,000,000. Replenishment applications will be submitted at least monthly by the DPEF. Each
replenishment request will be accompanied, as necessary, by an up-to-date bank statement and a
reconciliation statement
5.    Special Account for Withdrawal Made on the Basis of PMR. Upon receipt of each application for
withdrawal of an amount of the Credit, the Association shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the
Credit Account and deposit into the Special Account an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) the amount so
requested; and (b) the amount which the Association has determined, based on the PMR accompanying said
application, is required to be deposited in order to finance eligible expenditures during the six-month period
following the date of such report; provided, however, that the amount so deposited, when added to the
amount indicated by said PMR to be remaining in the Special Account, shall not exceed the amount of
US$6.0 million.
Counterpart Funds, Project Account
6.    The Government has agreed to deposit in a Project Account opened in a commercial bank an
annual amount equal to the amount of the initial deposit, and to replenish the project account at its initial
level on a quarterly basis to make sure there are sufficient funds to cover counterpart funds. At the time of
negotiations, Government agreed to set up a quarterly replenishable account US$250,000 equivalent, and to
provide a total of US$1 million equivalent per year in the Project account. An initial deposit of
US$250,000 equivalent in the Project Account is a condition of IDA Credit effectiveness. This Project
Account will be managed by the DPEF on terms and conditions agreeable to IDA.
Financial management
7.    Accounting and Financial Reporting. During the first phase of the program, the DPEF will be
responsible for financial management of the ESDP and will maintain the books and accounts. It will also
be responsible for the production of the annual financial statements. The DPEF has a satisfactory financial
and accounting unit. It has gained solid experience in IDA procedures through previous projects (the
General Education Project: Cr. 2706 and the Vocational Training Project: Cr.252 1). However, it will be
strengthened under this project with better performing computer equipment, refresher training and a revised
procedures manual. A local accounting firm with experience in project financial management will be
appointed to review the existing computerized accounting and financial management system, including the
accounting software, based on internationally acceptable accounting principles agreed with the Bank. The
firm will also prepare the accompanying accounting manual, including a proper chart of accounts, the
various transaction cycles, the fornat, content and periodicity of the various financial statements to be
produced, the budgetary procedures and process (preparation, monitoring, variance analysis, etc.), and the
relevant internal controls. The terms of reference have been reviewed and agreed to by IDA. The firn will
- 97 -



be responsible for the initial training of the accounting and financial management staff for the efficient
operation of the new software system. It will also be responsible for the preparation of a training program
in financial management and an implementation timetable for the duration of the project.
8.    Auditing. During negotiations, the Government provided the assurance that: (a) project accounts
will be audited in accordance with international standards by an experienced and internationally recognized
audit firm acceptable to IDA. The audit reports and related project accounts will be submitted to IDA
within six months after the end of Govemment's fiscal year; (b) in addition to their standard short-form
report with opinion, the auditors will be required to: (i) carry out a comprehensive review of all the SOE as
well as the internal control procedures governing their preparation for the relevant period under audit, and
express a separate opinion thereon; and (ii) review the management and utilization of the Special Account
and express a separate opinion thereon as well; (c) the auditor will also finalize the review of the internal
control system of the project with a view to identifying the major weaknesses and shortcomings and
proposing practical recommendations for improvement. The results of this review will be documented in a
Management Letter to be submitted along with the audit report.
9.    The financial auditors will also perform interim audits (in the ninth month of each fiscal year) to
review the internal control system including management performance, and issue reports to that effect
within one month from the end of their work. The findings and recommendations of the interim reports will
be addressed by management without delay before the final audit (within three to four months after closing
of the fiscal year of the project). The contracting of auditors on a multi-year contract, acceptable to IDA,
has already taken place; certification by the financial auditors that the project accounting system is
operational is a condition of credit effectiveness. The IDA credit will only finance audit expenditures under
incremental operating costs.
Monitoring and Reporting
10.   The World Bank is introducing an initiative to change loan administration in the World Bank
Group-financed projects, the Financial Management Initiative (FMI). This initiative assists in putting in
place sound financial management, procurement, and output monitoring systems for projects. Where
appropriate, and when these systems are in place, disbursements may be made on the basis of agreed
quarterly Project Management Reports (PMR) rather than on the basis of individual invoices or SOEs.
11.   During Phase 1, the project will not be considered as being in fill compliance with the FMI for
purposes of disbursements. The following action plan has been established in order to make the project
ready for FMI within 18 months of Credit effectiveness.

Sectoral Policy Letter
MAURITANIA: Education Sector Development Program
(Unofficial Translation)
Introduction
The 10-year assessment of the sector shows that substantial progress has been made especially with regard
to the quantitative development at the primary level of education, and to a lesser extent, at the secondary
level. In fact, the percentage of children gaining access to lower secondary falls below expectations. Only
55% complete the primary level.
Upper secondary education suffers from overcrowding due to the absence of a policy regulating the flow of
students through the system. The quality of teaching is irregular and there are disparities between the two
levels of teaching. The management of the system is inadequate. In addition, higher education, as well as
technical and vocational training are not relevant to the requirements of the development of the national
economy.
Law 99-012 on educational reform was adopted on April 26, 1999. This reform is aimed at consolidating
the accomplishments of the past while making the system definitely more open. The main pillar of the
reform entails the following:
*   Unifying the education system by establishing a single stream;
*   Strengthening first cycle of secondary education by extending it by one year (total of 4 years) and
teaching of the sciences by introducing physics and computer science;
*   Strengthening the teaching of foreign languages (French, English).
Within the framework of this reformn and with a view to correcting the inadequacies observed, the
Government has decided to establish a ten-year development program in the education sector. In this
context, our country's eligibility under the HIPC debt reduction initiative provides an opportunity for our
education system to benefit from additional resources which will enable it to make significant progress both
quantitatively and qualitatively. This prospect is consistent with the will of the Government to engage in a
process of sustained economic and social development.
I- Key issues to be addressed for the Development of the Education System in Mauritania
The ten-year education policy is based on the following objectives:
*   Strengthening the management system based on planning capacity, reorganizing the central
administration, on-going evaluation of the system and planning of recruitrnent;
*   Increasing education supply; this will necessitate, for example, creating a school location map, as well
as reorganizing university and technical and vocational training;
*   Enhancing the quality of teaching through the renovation of programs, educational material, fostering
professionalism and reorganizing initial and in-service training as well as strengthening administrative
- 107 -



and educational management;
* Improving human resource management by ensuring a performance-based merit system for career
planning and rationalization of postings;
*   Removing regional disparities under a voluntary policy for allocating resources;
* Increased schooling for girls-a key pillar of Government policy;
*   Increasing the role of the private sector in education through the implementation of an appropriate
policy.
II- Objectives of the Educational Policy According to Education Level
11-1 Basic Education
The main objectives of the primary education for the 2001-2010 period are as follows:
(1)    Improved access and student retention
Achieving universal access in the medium term (2005) making it possible to admit about 85,000 new
students in IAF as opposed to the current 66,275, will bring about a significant improvement in the
retention rate at this level (78% in 2010 against 55% currently) and entail the following measures:
* Widespread implementation of schools offering all levels by 2010. These structural changes will entail
use of the multigrade system in schools in rural areas;
- Rationalizing management and teacher posting system;
* Reducing regional disparities;
* Constructing and equipping about 530 additional classrooms per year;
* increasing teaching staff in the public schools estimated at 6,400 for the period;
* Admit roughly 30,000 children in the private sector by 2010.
(2)    Improved quality of education
This will entail:
* initial and in-service professional training for teachers and principals;
* Providing incentives for teachers appointed in disadvantaged areas;
* Gradually reducing the current student/teacher ratio of 48 to 40 by the year 2010;
*   Implementing new programs;
- 108-



*   Ensuring the availability of educational material (textbooks, guides, learning kits, etc ...);
*   Implementing a textbook policy aimed at ensuring the availability of textbooks in schools and
facilitating the liberalization of textbook publishing and distribution by 2005. To this end: (i) textbooks
for key subjects in primary and secondary education will be distributed free of charge, and (ii) other
textbooks will be sold to pupils wishing to acquire them, through the current distribution system which
will be improved (proceeds from sales will be deposited in a treasury account earmarked for the
procurement of textbooks).
*   Improving pedagogical and administrative management by making the training of middle level
managers more professional;
* Developing classroom learning assessment tools.
(3)    Implementation of the Reform:
Gradual implementation of the Reform up to the year 2004 must entail:
*   Adopting a teacher recruitment policy to meet the needs of the Reform;
*   Implementing intensive training programs for teachers who have the potential of becoming bilingual;
*   Prioritizing the posting of bilingual teachers in multigrade classes and monolingual teachers in areas
with a large concentration of students where they can carry a full teaching load.
11-2 Lower secondary education
(1) Improving the quality of education
Reform at the secondary level will entail the following:
*   Irproving the quality of pedagogical and administrative management (professional training of
inspectors and principals);
* Reducing the student/teacher ratio from 36 to 31 by the end of the period;
*   Adapting teaching programs by introducing subjects that will better prepare students for an
economically productive life;
*   Improving the production and dissemination of educational material;
*   Improved initial and in-service training of teaching personnel;
*   Developing classroom learning assessment tools.
(2)    Preparation and gradual implementation of the Reform
The Reform will affect secondary education at the beginning of the 2004 school year and its
implementation will extend to the beginning of the 2007 school year for lower secondary education. This
- 109-



will entail:
*   Progranming human resource management (recruitment and training based on new linguistic
requirements);
* Strengthening second language teaching for student cohorts entering the system prior to the Reforrn;
*   Revamping teaching programs taking into account curriculum changes in primary education, the
lengthening of the first cycle, the reorientation of its objectives and linguistic changes;
* Programming production and dissemnination of educational material.
The gradual introduction of a basic education comprising primary education and lower secondary education
will involve the reorganization of the latter. The fourth year of lower secondary education, to be introduced
in 2007 as part of the Reform, must be a year of preparation and orientation, which cannot be repeated.
(3) Reorganization of lower secondary education:
The gradual introduction of basic education will entail the extension of lower secondary education:
* Increased access to lower secondary education which will involve an estimated 35,000 new entrants by
the end of the period;
* Introduction of a certification examination;
e Measures for rethinking the crossover between basic education and the new objectives of lower
secondary education
11-3 Upper Secondary Education
The general objective of the education policy with regard to general upper secondary education is to
facilitate both qualitatively and quantitatively access to higher education. In this context, it is deemed that
effective regulation of the flow of students eligible for higher education can be accomplished by regulating
access to upper secondary education and implementing measures for independent candidates at the
end-of-cycle examination (32% of candidates in 1999). The following actions are envisaged within the
education policy:
(1)   Improving the quality of teaching.
Reform at the secondary level will entail:
* Gradual reduction of student intake, from 8,000 to 5, 000 by the end of the period;
*   Adoption of specific regulations for independent candidates at the end of second cycle examination;
* Reducing the student/teacher ratio from 23 to 16 by 2010;
*   Improving the quality of pedagogical and administrative management (professional training of
inspectors and principals);
- 110-



* Improving the production and dissemination of educational material;
* improving the initial and in-service training of teaching personnel;
* developing classroom leaming assessment tools;
* Revamping streams curricula so as to direct at least 50% of new admissions to scientific streams.
(2) Preparation and gradual implementation of the Reform.
The Reform will affect upper secondary education at the beginning of the 2008 school year and its
implementation will extend to the beginning of the 2011. This long-term undertaking will entail:
* programming human resource management (recruitment and training based on new linguistic
requirements);
e reinforcing second language teaching for groups entering the system prior to the Reform;
* Program revision based on curriculum changes, the extension of lower secondary education and
linguistic changes;
3   Programming production and dissemination of educational material.
-I-4 Technical and vocational training
The objectives defined for technical and vocational training (TVT) are aimed at improving the management
of the system, developing provision of technical education as well as specific short-term training to enable
the TVT to improve links with the other levels of education and the formal and informal sectors of
education.
(1)    Improving management of technical and vocational training
This will entail several measures:
* The establishment of the National Institute for Technical and Vocational Training (INFTP) which will
be responsible for providing technical support for decision-making and promoting technical and
vocational training. This institution will fall under the responsibility of the MEN;
* restructuring management mechanisms through a participatory process. The Director of INFTP will be
responsible for coordination and will chair the steering committee with representatives of all technical
and vocational training units in the ministries;
* establishment of a promotion fund under the responsibility of the INFTP; the fund will be financed
through contributions from businesses (learning taxes), Government and donor agencies and its
management will be shared (Government and the private sector).
- 111 -



* Implementation of demand-driven training through permanent school-to-job schemes.
(2)   Improved quality of training
This will require:
*   consolidation of in-service training for teachers as specified in the training plan;
* Renewal of educational equipment and material;
* Promoting training arrangements that combine school-based training with work experience.
(3)    Development and diversification of educational provision
The capacity of the TVT will be developed:
* quantitatively, by expanding existing institutions and creating new ones in the regions;
* qualitatively, by diversifying specialties in priority sectors;
Il-S Higher Education
The objectives of the ten-year reform program for higher education are two-fold: to improve intemal and
extemal efficiency in order to provide the country with high-caliber national managerial staff required for
its economic and social development, and to develop scientific research. This policy is built primarily
around the following points:
(1)   Improving higher education performance:
*   establishing an appropriate institutional framework (central orientation, design and coordination
structure, increased autonomy and scope for higher education institutions). In particular, a national
center will be created to improve the quality of extra-curricular services to the students. Similarly, the
management of the university restaurant and boarding facilities will be sub-contracted to the private
sector through a competitive procedure and based on clear terms of reference developed.
* Improving efficiency in public spending (gradual reduction of quotas reserved for foreign scholarships
and their reallocation to new training programs to be set up by national institutions by 2005).
(2)    Better matching of training and employment:
* controlling enTolments to reach 7,500 in 2005;
* diversifying of and fostering professionalism in training programs;
* restructuring existing training streams;
* establishing a mechanism for employment market monitoring and prospecting, and the integration of
graduates;
- 112 -



(3)   Improving the quality of higher education:
*  in-service teacher training;
*   strengthening the links between teaching and research;
*   improving pedagogical support systems (laboratories, libraries, electronic networks, NTIC, etc.);
*   Promoting the teaching function.
(4)    Gradually implementing the Reform measures:
*  promoting student teacher recruitment for the purposes of the Reform;
*  promoting the National Languages Department;
*  Introducing language teaching at the university, allowing monolingual students to receive one year of
language training.
(5)    Promoting scientific research:
*  developing research units and providing them with the appropriate tools;
*  promoting applied research;
*  encouraging the creation of research and exchange networks among researchers;
*  Establishing doctoral studies through partnership programs.
II-6 Management of the Educational System
The complexity of implementing the Reform and managing the educational system according to national
development interests demands that the practice of strategic management be developed rapidly. At the start
this involves a detailed analysis of all the problems arising from the Reform, followed by the introduction
and regular usage of modem evaluation and management techniques and tools adapted to the national
context.
1. From a sector standpoint, and as regards the Reform and its related ten-year plan, this entails: i)
defining exactly human and material requirements for Reform implementation, ii) drawing up a
schedule of actions to be taken, and iii) setting up an evaluation and monitoring mechanism to
gauge progress achieved and results obtained, and identifying the necessary adjustments in due
course.
To do this, it will be indispensable to design and build upon a set of instruments, such as: i) a
comprehensive information system using the most recent computer techniques (data bases,
simulation models, school maps, etc.), ii) specific and quantified operating plans, iii) standardized
procedures manuals, iv) a set of modernized and coherent regulations, and v) establishment and/or
strengthening of the necessary structures.
- 113-



With respect to the measures to be taken to meet the needs created by the growth in enrolments and
to ensure better management of student flows, the Ministry of National Education (MEN) will
quickly introduce an operational school map as well as reliable student files to adequately manage
the matching of educational programs with demand.
The MEN will also upgrade its examination management procedures at the primary and secondary
levels, and tighten its controls in order to reduce regional and gender disparities.
2. Apart from these sector aspects, particular emphasis will be placed on substantially improving
the system's management:
2.1 Human Resources
It has been observed that, in the current situation, the assignment of staff among the
institutions, especially at the primary level, is characterized by a high degree of uncertainty. It
is important to take the necessary measures to ensure greater efficiency and equity in the use
of public funds. To this end, i) a single structure will be created to handle assignments, ii)
criteria will be established to identify schools that will receive new staff, in order to
significantly improve staffing consistency. This will be based partly on the establishment of
criteria for assignments to the Willayas (administrative districts), in order to reduce current
regional disparities, and partly on criteria for assignments to schools within the different
Willayas. Finally, decisions will be taken to ensure that the assignment and movement of
personnel are concentrated between the two entry periods and not during the school year. An
incentives system will be set up to encourage teachers who work in a difficult context or who
provide a specific service (multigrade teaching, etc.).
2.2 Pedagogical Management
Apart from the pedagogical aspects and the quality of teaching that are the subject of specific
actions, measures will be taken to ensure that the resources mobilized in each institution of
leaming indeed translate into tangible results among the students (level of learning,
successfully passing national examinations, etc.). In this regard, it is decided i) that both the
institutions' resources and student results will be evaluated on a regular basis, ii) that this
information will be released to all the stakeholders and partners involved in schools, iii) that
inspectors will be asked to target their actions so that the weakest institutions do indeed
improve, and iv) that sanctions will be taken, if necessary.
2.3 Administrative and Financial Management
The strengthening of budgetary and material management will be based on a redefinition of
annual budget preparation procedures and the gradual implementation of budgets/programs
that are better adapted to multi-year development projects and allow for a greater
rationalization of investments and equipment. Efforts will also be made to improve the
management and maintenance of buildings, furniture, school materials and textbooks, to ensure
that they are functional over desirable periods of time. To accompany the current shift toward
decentralizing the MEN's services, regional national education boards (DREN) will be
established to bring the system's admninistration closer to the users. The missions of these
boards will be defined and adapted resources to help them fulfill these missions will be
- 114-



provided. Likewise, management committees will be created in the schools to provide a forum
for teachers and parents to discuss the institution's projects.
III- Management and Supervision of the Program.
Within the framework of the implementation of the National Education Sector Development Program, the
execution of the Program is put under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education, which defines the
broad orientations of the planning, supervision, evaluation and coordination of the overall program at the
central and regional levels. It is particularly responsible for:
*  the development of an expenditures framework in accordance with the program objectives, the
commitments towards the financial donors, the Government's budget instructions and the level of
participation of the external partners;
* the development of annual action plans and budgets for the various program components;
* the implementation of the parts of the annual action plans and budgets which are under the
responsibility of the Ministry of Education, and the coordination of the parts which are under the
responsibility of other ministries associated with the Program.
* the coordination of relations with donors as regards the preparation of the program and the progress of
its implementation;
 the centralization and consolidation of the quarterly progress reports of the Program execution, which
are written by the staff responsible of the components;
*  preparation of the sessions of the Program Coordination Comnittee.
Moreover, the Government plans to entrust the Direction des Projets Education Formation (DPEF) of the
Ministry of Development and Economic Affairs with the management of the Program's financial resources,
until the reinforcement of the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education, planned under the
Program, is completed. To that effect, the DPEF will be specifically in charge of the following:
- prepare the annual financial reports of the Program, in accordance with internationally accepted
accounting standards, and take the necessary measures for the auditing of these reports;
* ensure that disbursements are done in accordance with the requirements made by the Program partners;
*  manage the material resources allocated to the preparation and coordination of the Program;
* provide the different institutions in charge of the execution of the program with the necessary support,
and, in particular, with information, training and consulting services;
* manage the funds and ensure the regular supervision of commitments and payments;
* ensure strict observance of the procedures of the various partners involved in the Program;
* collect the results of the works undertaken and the audits performed within the framework of the
Program and submit them to the Program's Management Committee and Coordination Committee.
- 115-



IV- Specific Questions
1) Girls'education
The Government will develop special measures to encourage the education and retention of girls in the
system by reducing the handicaps they face in their education as well as in examinations.
*   strengthening female education in primary schools in regions with strong gender disparities;
*   Establishing incentive policies to increase the presence of girls in secondary schools and other higher
institutions.
2) Promotion of the private sector
In an effort to make universal education a reality and to ensure quality training, the Government
will support the development of the private sector at all levels of the educational system through a
set of incentives and institutional measures, including:
o   creating and implementing an administrative structure at the MEN responsible for the accreditation,
management and control of private education;
*   instituting incentive measures for the development of the private sector through the establishment of a
private-sector promotion support fund;
*   setting out specifications for private sector intervention;
=   establishing educational support for teacher training;
-   Establishing a permanent evaluation and infornnation system.
3) School health, environment, and citizenship
The Govenmuent will strengthen its partnerships with the health and environmental sectors to ensure that all
students, irrespective of their educational level, are familiar with the major issues surrounding their civic
and social integration and health promotion. This policy will be based on the following actions:
*   adapting and strengthening programs concerning the improvement of school health, environmental
protection and citizenship;
*   adapting training modules for student teachers in school health, environmental protection and civic
education;
*   establishing a health, hygiene and nutrition policy in educational institutions;
*   installation of latrines (for teachers, boys and girls) and access to drinking water for all schools;
- 116-



* In-service training, production and distribution of educational material.
4) Early childhood development
Aware of the importance of preschool education in preparing children for a revamped primary education
program, the Government will provide all its support to help develop this sector by encouraging the
establishment of partnerships involving families, local communities and local and foreign NGOs, as well as
technical and financial partnerships. Actions to be taken during the decade will focus on:
*   Support for the development of community initiatives;
* Early childhood development training system;
* Bolstering of early childhood resource centers;
* Development of institutional management capacities.
5) Non-formal religious education
With respect to non-fonnal religious education, the Government will take steps to ensure more
complementarity between formal schools and Mahadras so that the latter can better fulfill their role in the
national universal education effort.
This policy will involve:
   conducting a study for the identification and classification of the Mahadras;
v   establishing specifications with minimum conditions of openness and exercise;
* establishing a qualification system for the Mahadras, to make them eligible for financial and
pedagogical support from the Government;
= strengthening incentive measures for the sector's development;
* reinforcing supervision and control mechanisms;
*   improving coordination between the Department of National Education and the SEAEO in terms of
planning, pedagogical programs and training of Sheiks;
* Establishing linkages between qualified Mahadras, on the one hand, and vocational training centers and
the educational system, on the other.
6) Literacy
A specific national policy will be drawn up for the eradication of illiteracy and resources will be allocated
to allow the target populations to escape the cycle of poverty. Literacy, in this instance, will be functional,
in that it will be focused on income-generating activities and trades, or will have a social and civic function
in general, thereby allowing people to use the language skills acquired in their daily lives.
- 117 -



The development of this policy will entail:
*   identifying target populations using the general census results;
*   rallying all stakeholders involved in the fight against illiteracy;
*   diversifying intervention tools (involvement of the Mahadras, experimentation with mobile literacy
units, consolidation of literacy campaigns and improvement of the performance of permanent literacy
centers);
*   controlling and developing literacy engineering;
*   Improving communication assistance.
The ten-year strategy for the development of the educational sector outlined above is supported by a
ten-year program, the ESDP. This program constitutes the framework around which all actions in the
educational sector will be built.

Annex 12
Macro-Financial Framework of ESDP
MAURITANIA: Education Sector Development Program
Unofficial Translation
Developing a basic education system comprising primary education and lower secondary education, for a
total of 10 years of schooling beginning in 2007, is a priority underpinning all the orientations proposed
under the ten-year program that is being prepared. The educational policy can be oriented from a systemic
perspective based on the following points:
Consolidation of the system's management through the development of forecasting capabilities,
structuring of the central administration, permanent evaluation of the system, and programming of
recruitment.
*     Improvement of educational provision by establishing a school map, reorganizing the university
and technical and vocational training.
Enhancement of the quality of teaching by renovating programs and educational material,
professionalizing and structuring initial and in-service training, and improving pedagogical and
administrative guidance.
*     Improvement of human resources management by establishing career tracking based on merit and
performance appraisal and the rationalization of assignments.
*     Elimination of regional disparities by implementing a voluntary resource allocation policy.
*     Promotion of girls' enrollment, which remains a major component of Govemment policy.
*     Expansion of the role of the private sector in the provision of education through a private-sector
promotion policy.
The overarching goal of the simulations was to improve quality at all levels and relevance vis-a-vis the
labor market at the highest levels (higher, technical and vocational). These simulations were also conducted
with the idea that there were strong educational policy decisions concerning major segments of the system,
on the one hand, and less defined options for other segments, on the other hand. Primary, higher and upper
secondary education fall into the first category, while technical, vocational and lower secondary education
fall into the second category. The strategy of conducting simulations was then to quantify the defined
policies, taking into account both their quantitative and qualitative dimensions, and to propose altematives
for the quantitative and qualitative development of technical, vocational and lower secondary education.
Apart from quantifying the different elements conceming the resources to be used, simulations were also
conducted for resources likely to be used, with a focus on the balance to be achieved between jobs and the
resources of the educational sector as a whole.
The overall macro-economic framework chosen for these simulations is built around the following
scenarios: average annual growth of 6% over the period, tax revenues representing about 27.8% and an
increase in regular education spending as a percentage of Govemment revenues, from 13.5% to 16.5% at
- 119-



the end of the period.
The purpose of this note is to present the simulations for the different levels of education in order to
determine their impact on the education operating budget and to help decision-makers to make the
appropriate choices.
I. Primary Education
The proposed policy revolves around five main ideas:
1.     Quickly achieving universal access in first grade of primary school; this goal is expected to be
reached by 2005;
2.     Substantially improving the retention rate in the primary education, mainly by ensuring educational
continuity over the six years of schooling; the goal is to gradually raise the percentage of students who start
and complete the primary education from 55% today to about 78% in 2010;
3.     Reducing class repetitions. The repetition rates currently stand at 14% for the first five years of the
cycle and at 30% for the final year. These rates will be gradually reduced to 5% between grades 1 and 5
and to 15% in grade 6;
4.     Improving the quality of teaching. The first measure concems the introduction of bilingualism,
which will require strong actions: i) ensuring that ENI graduates are effectively bilingual and ii) recycling a
sufficient proportion of teachers currently in service. Likewise, from a more logistical standpoint, three
major aspects will be considered: a) establishment of salary premiums for teachers in hardship areas
(estimated at 15% of salary for about 35% of potentially eligible teachers, on the understanding that the
awarding criteria are still to be determined); b) gradual reduction of the student-teacher ratio from 48 today
to 40 in 2010. This will help develop education (retention) in rural areas where school populations are low
and where classes (even using the multigrade formula) will have reduced enrollments. It will also help
reduce congestion in certain urban classes where enrollment currently exceeds the pedagogically desirable
threshold; c) provision of sufficient resources for the different activities needed for the qualitative operation
and better management of primnary education (administration, evaluation and pedagogical management,
in-service training of teachers, school manuals and didactic/pedagogic materials for students and teachers).
In the current situation, these expenditures represent only 17.5% of the teacher wage bill, a percentage that
is expected to increase gradually to 31% by 2010.
5.    Improving administrative and pedagogical management activities. They are mentioned here solely
for the record, since they only involve relatively modest specific budgetary resources, which are
incorporated into point c) above. First of all, these activities are designed to better manage the allocation of
staff and resources to the schools. It would be necessary to: i) define the institutional framework in which
the responsibilities of the centralized (DEF, DP, DPC) and decentralized (DREF, local authorities) levels
will be clarified, and ii) define and apply homogenous and transparent criteria for the allocation of staff to
the schools. Secondly, these activities are meant to improve pedagogical management, not so much as
defined by conventional actions (inspection, school management), but rather in terms of the expected
functionality of the mechanism. What is at issue here is the efficient management (measurement and
regulation) of the transfornation between public resources used at the schools and outcomes (student
results in national examinations and/or assessment tests).
As for the wage policy outlook, apart from the establishment of salary premiums for teachers in hardship
- 120-



areas mentioned above, the average level of salary for teachers is expected to increase by 24% by 2010, in
constant monetary units, but at a slightly slower pace than the projected per capita GDP. As a result, the
salary level would represent about 4.5 times the per capita GDP. It should be noted that, in the current
situation, the average level of teacher salary represents about 5.1 times the per capita GDP.
11. Lower Secondary Education
The proposed policy is to gradually ensure continuity between the primary level and the lower secondary
level to ultimately provide 10 years of basic education. In this regard, the plan for the decade is to establish
measures that facilitate pedagogical linkages between primary education and the lower secondary level to
better prepare graduates for entry into the labor force. The main measures proposed revolve around the
following points:
Considering the Improvement of the retention rate at the primary level, the plan for the next decade is to
maintain the transition rate between primary and secondary education at 50%. This measure will help
increase the number of students accessing secondary education from 18,344 students to about 35,000 in
2010, for an overall student enrollment in this cycle of 92,803 (versus roughly 39,000 at present). The
scenario of maintaining the transition rate at 50% was preferred over that of raising the rate to 70%.
Indeed, the latter scenario will increase new admissions from 18,344 to 48,569, for an overall
enrollment of 125,584, which would seem impossible to achieve simply from a logistical standpoint, not
to mention the difficulties that would be involved in financing this option.
Improving the quality of this level of education is a major component of the educational policy that will
be followed. In this regard, three types of measures are considered concurrently: i) gradual but
substantial reduction of the student-teacher ratio from the current level of 36 to 31 (representing an
average class size of 40 students) in 2010; ii) adaptation of teaching programs to better prepare
graduates for entry into the labor force (accounting, etc.); iii) stabilizing non-salary expenditures
(administration, inspection and evaluation, pedagogical materials for teachers and students, in-service
training for teachers), which today represent about 85% of the teacher wage bill (17,676 UM/student in
2010 versus 12,430 UM/student in 1998 in constant monetary units).
As for the wage policy outlook, the average level of teacher salary is expected to rise by 22%, in
constant monetary units, but at a slightly slower pace than the projected per capita GDP. As a result,
the salary level will represent about 6.1 times the per capita GDP. It should be noted that, in the current
situation, the average teacher salary represents about 7.1 times the per capita GDP.
Furthermore, the third year is expected to be a skills certification year leading to several options: i) entry
into the labor force, or ii) entry into technical and vocational schools, and iii) entry into year 4, which will
be considered an orientation year toward the second cycle with no repetition allowed.
III. Upper Secondary Education
The overall outlook for the educational policy followed for the second cycle of secondary education is to
prepare access to higher education in terms of both quantity and quality. In this context, the basic
regulation of the flow of students with access to higher education is expected to be facilitated by that
introduced for access to the second cycle of secondary education. The following educational policy
measures are therefore envisaged:
1.    While the current number of students entering the general second cycle of secondary education is
- 121 -



slightly more than 8,000, this number is expected to decline gradually to between 5,000 and 5,500; this
goal will be achieved by 2005, and it will help stabilize student enrollment for this level at about 14,500;
2.     The significant improvement of the quality of this level of education is a key component of the
educational policy that will be followed. In this regard, three types of measures are considered
concurrently: i) gradual but substantial reduction of the student-teacher ratio from the current level of 23 to
16 (representing an average class size of 28 students) in 2010; ii) restructuring of the educational streams
by allocating 50% of spaces to science education and by putting more emphasis on mathematics, physics
and chemistry; iii) expanded use of resources per student in terms of both investment spending (installation
of functional computer equipment, science laboratories and documentation services) and operations. On the
latter point, it is anticipated that non-salary expenditures (administration, inspection and evaluation,
pedagogic material for teachers and students, in-service training for teachers), which today represent about
45% of the teacher wage bill (12,478 MU/student in 1998), will increase gradually to 70% in 2010 (40,280
MU/student in constant MU).
IV. Technical and Vocational Training (TVT)
The policy orientation for the next decade with respect to TVT marks a shift from a supply-driven system
to a demand-driven system. Improving the quality of training will constitute a strategic objective for the
decade. Through its job-oriented focus, this component of the mechanism must play a major role in
regulating flows within the system.
Due to the uncertainties and constraints faced by TVT, the 10-year strategy will be phased in through the
development of pilot projects aimed at quality improvement, development and diversification of supply, and
introduction of new training modes (schcol-to-job and apprenticeship schemes) that are more reflective of
the needs of the productive sectors.
The implementation of this policy will be in two phases:
Phase 1: experimentation with new training modes through the development of pilot projects, establishment
of structures for the coordination, engineering, financing, monitoring and systematic evaluation of related
activities. This first five-year phase should help double TVT enrollments (currently 2,500).
The implementation of this first phase of the strategy involves the following major activities:
1.    Improvement of the quality of existing training programs by introducing school-to-job schemes and
in-service training for staff. For TVT under the responsibility of the MEN, this improvement will be
achieved gradually between 2003 and 2005 (at a rate of 25% of current enrollments per year), in order to
cover all enrollments in the current sections over these four years. As for vocational training under the
responsibility of the Ministry of Public Service, school-to-job schemes will be introduced simultaneously
and will cover all enrollments beginning in 2003. School-to-job schemes will be implemented at a rate of
20% of in-service training time.
2.     Creation of an additional admission capacity of 1,470 places for school-to-job training schemes
lasting one to two years, between 2002 and 2005.
3.     Creation of an apprenticeship training capacity of 1,200 places between 2002 and 2005.
Apprenticeship training will last no more than one year and will be given at a rate of 50% of in-service
training time. The training will cover trades in which the economy is already primed for this type of
- 122-



training.
4.    In addition to the pennanent admission capacities, in school-to-job and apprenticeship schemes, an
Autonomous Fund for the Promotion of TVT is expected to be set up, to encourage demand-driven
management of TVT through the development of new training modes. This Fund will allow companies to
develop short-term training schemes (not exceeding 6 months) to meet their qualification needs. A
lump-sum is to be earmarked for the launching of the Fund.
5.    Apart from these activities, the strategy also includes a segment to improve the quality and
relevance of TVT via the creation of the National Institute for the Promotion of TVT, which will be
responsible for the system's engineering through: (i) analysis and processing of data on the labor market's
qualification needs, (ii) establishment of a quality system, (iii) renovation of training programs, (iv)
development of specific engineering for new training modes (school-to-job and apprenticeship schemes), (v)
establishment of a system to monitor and evaluate TVT activities, (vi) TVT promotion activities.
Phase 2: At the end of the fifth year of the program, an overall evaluation of the experimental first phase
will be conducted. Based on the results of this evaluation, the necessary corrections will be made for the
development of the TVT mechanism and its adaptation to demand. Regardless of the volume of
development that will be prescribed following the evaluation of phase I of the program, the resulting
simulations are based on the assumption, for example, that enrollments will double for phase 2.
V. Higher Education
The higher education policy is designed, broadly speaking, to make higher education congruent with the
qualitative and quantitative needs of the national economy. This general goal is based on the following
scenarios:
1.    Enrollments, which have ballooned to about 9,500 students today, are expected to be reduced
gradually to about 7,500 by 2005; this will lead to a capping of the number of new admissions at about
2,600 per year.
2.    As regards quality improvement, the following measures will be considered together: i) gradual
reduction of the student-teacher ratio from 31 to 14 in 2010, in keeping with intemational standards
conceming vocational training; ii) the percentage of students in the science and technical streams will
increase from 10% to 25% in 2005; iii) increase in operating expenses per student from 22,000 UM to
50,000 UM in 2010.
3.    Graduat 40% reduction of the quota for foreign scholarships by 2005 and the reallocation of these
amounts for the financing of new training, notably vocational and short-term training given by national
institutions.
4.    Creation of a scientific research support fund of about 160 million UM in 2010 accompanied by a
resulting investment in specialized equipment and documentation.
- 123-



The establishment of these measures is based on the assumption that regular public expenditures on
education as a percentage of GDP will increase from 3.7% to about 4.7% in 2010, while the resources
anticipated in the simulations will represent about 4.6% of GDP. To achieve a balance in regular
expenditures, the share of education expenses in total Goverrmnent revenues should increase from 13.5% to
15.5%.
If expenses related to vocational training (MFPTJS) are included, they will represent 4.9% of GDP and
16.8% of Government revenues at the end of the period.

Education Sector Reform in Mauritania
MAURITANIA: Education Sector Development Program
1. The Context
Over the past three decades Mauritania's education system has evolved significantly, passing through
several reforms (1967, 1973, 1979) aimed at establishing a system that responds to the socio-cultural and
socio-economic developments needs of the country. The penultimate reform (1979) lasted for twenty years
during which there was a dual education system separated by two languages of instruction (Arabic and
French). The system was characterized by high enrolment ratios which had increased remarkably from 54%
in 1985 to 90% in 1998 but quality was poor as indicated by poor pupil performance and retention.
Educational provision was costly because of the multiple human and material resources adapted to a dual
system of education. Poor mastery of the languages was identified as one of the main reasons for weak
pupil performance particularly in science subjects and the content of school curricula was allegedly not
adapted to the economic needs of the country. The necessity to improve the performance, efficiency and
competitiveness of the education system at a global level increased the pressure for the Government to
urgently reform the system.
2. The Reform
Through law number 99-012 of 26 April, 1999, the Government of Mauritania (GOM) decided to
undertake a broad based reform aimed at correcting the weaknesses of the education system. Although the
reform affects all levels of the education sector, the focus has been on the primary and secondary levels.
The 1999 education reform seeks to achieve three main objectives which are:-
(i)    establishing a unified bilingual system of education where Arabic is the language of instruction for
the literary subjects and French is the language of instruction for mathematics and science subjects,
(ii)   increasing the duration of the first cycle of secondary education from three to four years
(iii)  introducing English language, information technology and civic instruction from the first year of
secondary education.
Primary education measures:
Conserve Arabic as the medium of instruction to all children in grade one in the public or private
sector.
Introduce French from the second year of primary, teaching it for 6 hours a week
Introduce the teaching of Mathematics in French from grade three of primary
Introduce the teaching of natural sciences in French in grades five and six of primary.
Introduce civic education to be taught independently of religious education
Due to the small capacity of secondary schools to receive the majority of students from primary to
secondary, vocational training centers would be opened in the different regions to admit some of the
students who have no access into secondary. The possibility of extending the basic cycle to include first
cycle secondary will be examined later as the reform works its way through the system.
First Cycle Secondary measures:
Extend the duration of the cycle from 3 to 4 years
Introduce the teaching of English in the first year for 2 hours per week
Continue the teaching of mathematics and natural sciences in French
Introduce physical sciences in the third year and information technology in the fourth year of the
- 130 -



first cycle,
*      Introduce civic education to be taught independently of religious education as of the first year of
the cycle
*      Revise the number of hours and coefficients to reflect the changes in the level of language usage.
The end of first cycle of secondary education examination (Brevet) will be unified and will comprise of
tests in English and physics with adequate coefficients. At the end of the fourth year regulatory mechanisms
will be put for transition into the second cycle. Students who do not have access to second cycle general
education will take entrance examninations into middle level technical and professional schools. Students
who intend to pursue general education after the first cycle, will have a choice between five disciplines
namely modem letters, Arabic, earth and life sciences, mathematics and technology.
Apart from the simultaneous introduction of civic education in all grades of primary and secondary
education and the introduction of English language in the first year of the first cycle secondary, the reform
is expected to be implemented gradually (year by year) over a period of twelve years. The first cohort of the
reform started is currently in the third grade of primary.
Cognizant of other weaknesses relating to the external efficiency of the education system, the reform also
calls for a complete overhaul of the system. In order to attain the goals of global competitiveness and
poverty reduction, the reform emphasizes the need to attain universal access to basic education, enhance the
quality of education by making schools and classrooms the center of change, improve school curricula and
training programs so as to produce graduates who would respond to the needs of the labor market.
3. The process
The 1999 reform law sparked a range of activities in the education sector and laid the foundation for the
unprecedented development of a strategic education policy framework. Studies were undertaken leading to
the production of a series of reports namely, education sector country status report (primary and
secondary), technical and vocational education report, higher education study report, an audit of the
organizational structure and administrative management of the Ministry of Education. The major issues
identified through these studies include:- limited and inequitable access to primary and secondary education
due mostly to supply constraints, poor quality and low intemal efficiency of primary and secondary
education due to high repetition and dropout rates, low institutional capacity for system management,
minimally responsive technical and vocational education, inefficient higher education, inadequate funding
and sub-optimal allocation of resources particularly at the school level. The Govemment set up a
consultative body to discuss the findings of these studies and develop strategies to resolve the problems
identified. A strategic policy framework documents was prepared after these discussions and the raison
dW'tre of this framework is to provide guidance for the implementation of future activities and interventions
aimed at achieving sector investment goals.
4. The challenges
To achieve the Government's stated education development goals and produce the desired effects, there are
a core set of challenges linked both to the management of the system and pedagogic practices, that the
Government would need to meet. These broadly include language skill development for sufficient quantities
of teachers, finance and resource allocation, educational management and information, quality, efficiency
as well as equity issues. These areas are complementary hence the effective implementation of the reform
requires a mix of activities that are consistent and mutually reinforcing from each one of them.
Language skill development.
- 131 -



One of the major requirements for a successful implementation of the reform is the development of the
linguistic capacity of teachers to operate a truly bilingual education system. The present teaching corps
consists mainly of teachers who are proficient either in Arabic or French. The market for those who can be
bilingual is relatively small so the Government would need to attract high school graduates who have had
their secondary general education especially in French and who can communicate in Arabic, into the
teaching profession. The number of sufficiently bilingual teachers in the system is relatively small now
compared to the numbers required. Extra efforts need to be made to provide intensive language training to
existing teachers who have the potential of becoming bilingual and current pre-service teacher education
programs need to be revised to include language skills training. In-service teacher courses must also be
organized to strengthen the capacity of teachers in the schools.
Finance and resource allocation
The GOM faces the challenge of providing adequate financing for education. Constraints on public
resources have limited the ability of the Government to allocate sufficient resources to education. The share
of GDP that is allocated to education decreased from 5.2% in 1985 to 3.5% in 1998. The need to finance
activities of the reform as well as other educational services cannot be overemphasized. However within the
competing claims on its limited resources, the Government has to make decisions about the allocations of
national resources, aid and proceeds of debt relief to key sectors like education. Decisions on the
appropriate level of overall spending for education and a determination of how much should be allocated to
each level is crucial. Within each level, the allocation of resources would have to be made to activities that
have the highest marginal returns. The challenge is not just how much funding is allocated to education but
how efficiently and how effectively the resources are used. There should be sufficient information about the
system as well as local capacity to undertake cost/benefit analysis of alternative forms of investments in
order to optimize resource utilization. Sources of finance, and a definition of the degree of contribution
from each needs to be carefully thought through. Another challenge is for the Government of Mauritania to
encourage other service providers such as the private sector (including non-Governmental organizations) to
play the role of provider of services and or sources of finance.
Educational manazement.
Effective implementation of the new policy directions identified within the context of the reform would
require appropriate management competences within the Ministry of Education. Experience from other
countries has shown that resource use can be significantly improved by changing the management strategy
of the sector. The most frequently considered option focuses on the centralization versus the
decentralization of educational service provision. Generally it is believed that the efficiency of educational
spending increases when the decision points are closer to the schools or decentralized. The current system
of management in Mauritania is centralized although there are regional services which often rely on the
central level for management decisions. The Government's challenge is to balance decentralization of
decision making to local levels while making sure that the central level oversees the quality and coherence
of the entire system. It is important to note that decentralization is not a panacea to the problems of
education systems. While there are merits in decentralizing educational services, the options cover a range
of shades from white to black. The Government of Mauritania would have to choose the degree of
decentralization that it is comfortable with. Irrespective of what option is chosen, a critical concept for the
improvement of efficiency is school autonomy. Greater autonomy of the school and better links between the
school and the community hold great potential for the improvement of opportunities for learning. In an
autonomous school situation, teachers and school directors are better placed to find solutions and take
responsibility for improving teaching and the performance of pupils regarding what is taught.

Qualitv and efficiency
One of the central aims of the reform is to improve the opportunity for children to learn. Universal primary
education will not be achieved nor maintained without sufficient attention paid to improving the quality of
education provided in the schools. Quality improvement results in reduced repetition, greater efficiency and
affordability. The challenge is for the GOM to move from a narnow focus of academic performance to an
emphasis on learning outcomes for all children. This calls for a more holistic approach where the needs of
the learner, within the classroom and the school are looked at carefully. A set of necessary conditions that
flow from this approach include:- developing committed and motivated teachers, defining and implementing
appropriate curricula, providing appropriate teaching and learning materials, using appropriate languages
for teaching and learning, promoting community participation in school activities, managing physical assets
effectively, strengthening school based management, undertaking meaningful assessments and using the
results as feedback to enhance teaching, creating a child-friendly learning environment, improving the
supervision of schools, increasing learning time at school and harnessing new and old technologies.
Equity focus.
The attainment of poverty reduction goals requires universal access to primary education. Currently, there
are great disparities in educational opportunities for children from different socio-economic backgrounds
and for those living in urban and rural areas. Mauritania has high enrolment ratios (close to 90%) but
retention is low (55%) partly because of poor quality and a shortfall of schools classrooms especially in
remote rural and peri-urban areas. The challenge for the Government is to enable all children to have
access to primary education by constructing sufficient numbers of classrooms, rehabilitating deteriorating
physical and using existing structures more efficiently through double shifting and multi-grading. It is also
important to ensure that education provided is of good quality. Gender equality in schooling is also a
challenge that needs to be addressed. Educational opportunities for girls can be made equal to that of boys
by ensuring that there are more female teachers in the system, that schools are well equipped to cater to
girls' needs, and that teachers are trained to be gender sensitive. Expanding pre-school education is another
challenge that will improve children's readiness to learn when they begin primary school. Currently
pre-schools exist in urban centers and this creates a disadvantage for rural who tend to repeat grade one
partly because compared to urban children, they have received fewer if any experiences at home that are
conducive to cognitive development.
Institutional Capacity strengthening.
The challenge to strengthen institutional capacity in the Ministry of education from the central through the
regional and district to the school level is urgent. The current limited capacity to budget, and to utilize
resources more effectively and with accountability further undermines the Ministry's capacity to manage
the sector. Without sufficient capacity to plan, manage and maintain the education sector, the Government
of Mauritania will find it difficult to attain the goal to provide education of good quality. Technical
capacity, including the development of appropriately trained education specialists, economists and
statisticians who can research and analyze sector issues is crucial and needs to be encouraged.
Strengthening existing capacity and creating new capacity to realize and sustain the new vision is essential.
Donor coordination.
The Government of Mauritania receives significant support from external development partners in forms
that vary from financial resources to knowledge sharing. However, past efforts made within the context of
education projects by various development agencies have remained largely uncoordinated and often
overlap. The challenge is for the Govermment of Mauritania to lead and organize all donors to work in
partnership amongst themselves and with the Government towards achieving the objectives of the reform.

Annex 14
Key Elements of the Quality Enhancement Strategy
MAURITANIA: Education Sector Development Program
The key elements of the government of Mauritania strategy to improve the quality of education are: (i)
improving the efficiency of pre-service and in-service teacher training, (ii) improving the management of
the teaching and learning process, (iii) improving the deployment of teaching staff. The following note
summarizes the issues and policies involved and the actions that are planned with regard to quality
enhancement..
I - Improving teacher training
Findings on the quality of primary education (IPN studies on program evaluations and on the performance
of 4th and 6th year students) underscore the low quality of education in Mauritania. Students only acquire
approximately 40% of the content of targeted programs, with performance varying widely among the
various classes within the sample - a variation which remains significant even when factors like the impact
of students' social characteristics and mobilized resources are controlled for.
The ESDP faces considerable challenges particularly as, in the near future, the education system itself will
be transformed and consolidated into a single bilingual system with modified programs and the introduction
of civic and health education.
The recent evaluations show that of the 8000 teachers in the system: (i) 1,200 are already bilingual, (ii)
2,400 are considered almost bilingual (a refresher course can be offered in the short term), and (iii) 1,600
seem to have a long way to go to acquire the desired skills (however, a large proportion of teachers in this
category could acquire the necessary skills by participating in a more robust training program). Finally,
the remaining 2,800 primary school teachers (essentially Arabic speaking) present a more difficult
scenario, as it does not seem likely that they can become bilingual. Apart from the language issue, these
evaluations further indicate that though a majority of the teachers have reasonable knowledge of the
curriculum content, not all do; thus activities designed to improve subject matter skills as well as
pedagogical skills will be required for aproportion of the teachers. Therefore, a double strategy needs to be
implemented to authorize the effective introduction of the reform concerning bilingualism and reinforce the
skills of some of the current teaching staff.
First of all, on the issue of bilingualism, from now on all new recruits (approximately 2500 from now to
2005), will receive initial training at the ENI (teachers' training college) which will qualify them for
bilingualism. Besides, all teachers do not have to be bilingual (particularly in the short term) for the reform
to be effectively implemented because: (i) first grade studies will be conducted in the Arabic language; and
(ii) second to sixth year elementary school programs will be taught in both languages. The plan therefore is
to: (i) implement training sessions specifically for the 2400 elementary school teachers who are potentially
bilingual; and (ii) organize the posting of teachers so as to offer all students curriculum content in the
languages stipulated in the context of the reform. This will be done through a priority posting of bilingual
teachers to smaller schools, where much flexibility is needed from teachers to cover the curricula. A policy
based on meaningful salary incentives has been proposed to facilitate this reposting.
Plans for providing language training to the 2400 teachers who are almost bilingual include the use of
training modules, which are currently being developed (with the assistance of the Cooperation franqaise
- 134-



(French Cooperation Agency) which will also train the trainers), and training sessions which will be
provide by the district and regional capitals during school holidays (two weeks in December, two weeks in
March, and two months in the sumrner). Apart from these training periods, activities will also be planned
during the school year (plans are underway for distance education supported by the use of radios). At the
end of the first year of training, the teachers will be able to take a test to obtain a certificate of bilingualism;
those unable to become certified will have to pursue a longer training course.
Finally, with regard to the 1600 teachers who are expected to require longer training to be able to teach in
the two languages, training in their weaker language will be provided from academic year 2002-2003, with
the knowledge that it may take a few years for them to obtain the required certification.
With regard to the need to irmprove the subject matter knowledge and pedagogical skills of some of the
teachers, and the need to train all teachers in new subject areas as well as in the methodology of the new
teaching program (targeting skills, classroom interactions, management of multigrade classes), important
activities have been planned. A triple strategy will be implemented. Any traditional training offered by the
two EN), ENS and IPN will focus mainly on the training of trainers, inspectors (160 inspectors) and
inspection officers. In fact, the main pedagogical strategy will be implemented at the local level, through
consolidation around the districts, and through the actions taken in the schools with respect to the school
directors and individual teachers. Thus, the training of school directors will in particular be oriented, on the
one hand, towards the management of the school project in partnership with the parent/teacher associations
and, on the other hand, towards providing support to teachers in their schools who have shortcomings and
are taking refresher courses.
The recruitment of personnel for inspections as well as for the budget, for the recruitrnent effort as well as
for the inspectors' operations in the schools in their districts, will be included in the MENbudget.
Issues Concerning the Training of Secondary Education Teachers and Staff. Important aspects of the
training of teachers and staff at the secondary education level include: (i) the substantial quantitative
extension of the system planned in the 10-year program; (ii) the implementation of new curriculum content
currently being developed (new subjects and new teaching methodologies); and (iii) the provision of
language training to several science teachers and teachers of some literary disciplines.
With regard to the first two points, initial training will be offered at ENS according to the new
methodology, which, on the one hand, takes into consideration the content of the new secondary education
programs and, on the other hand, reinforces the professional and pedagogical dimension compared to
current practices. The details about this training are under development. Some of the modules developed by
the ENS for the initial training will be used as the basis for the continuous training of current teachers.
With regard to retraining some of the teachers in the languages of instruction stipulated by the reform, an
assessment of language skills comparable to the one conducted at the primary school level (see above) will
be used to evaluate the skills of the teachers concerned. The results of this assessment will indicate: a) the
teachers who have the appropriate language skills, b) are capable of obtaining certification through
relatively simple upgrading activities, and c) those who require stronger actions. For those in category a),
language training will be offered during vacations (following guidelines identical to those used at the
primary school level), whereas for those in category c), a full year of training will be provided at the Centre
d 'Enseignement des Langues Secondes (second language teaching center) at the Universite de Nouakchott.
II - Improving the Management of the Learning and Teaching process
- 135 -



Intemational experience suggests that improving educational management requires that the interests of all
the individual actors in the education system are aligned with the interests of the overall system. The
education system clearly has an interest in attaining the goals defined in the content of the curriculum and
ensuring that the resources mobilized for education produce the maximum learning outcomes for pupils.
Currently, the individual actors in the education system in Mauritania are: (i) not adequately informed
about the precise content and goals of the curriculum. Textbooks and teachers' guides are not sufficiently
available; and/or (ii) teachers not sufficiently motivated to channel their energies and skills to achieve the
task entrusted to them. New structures accompanied with formnal contracts that define precisely what is
expected of the particular actor concerned (teachers, school principals, school inspectors, DREF,
education administrators at the center) are being developed. The standard structure is organized around
three complementary components: (i) definition of what is expected of each actor, (ii) definition of how to
verify what is achieved by each actor; (iii) definition of the consequences of good or bad performance.
Teachers are undoubtedly the principal actors. They must be informed clearly about the content of the
curriculum they must transmit to pupils. They must be provided textbooks and guides. Their
responsibilities for the most important aspects of classroom practices and behavior (attendance, preparation
of lesson plans, planning teaching for the school year, pupil evaluation and remedial work) must be
clarified. They must be informed about how their performance and behavior in transmitting the desired
curricular content will be verified. Finally they must be informed about the personal consequences of their
professional performance (rewards, disciplinary action, professional assistance).
Other actors also have an important role to play in this process: (i) to monitor teacher attendance, an
attendance register could be kept and filled out by both the school principal and representatives of
parent-teacher associations; (ii) to monitor instructional practices such as preparation of lessons, planning
of instructional time, student evaluation, and interaction with parents, teachers should keep a docunent
describing these activities for the entire school year. The principal could monitor the progress of these
activities, as well as the inspector during his/her visits; (iii) to monitor pupil learning, inspectors will play
the main role. They would use examination results and pupil evaluations prepared by IPN to compile an
annual report on the status of each school and its performance, which would be sent to the central
education administration. The report would also describe the actions implemented by the inspectorate to
remedy inadequate practices and performance. Finally, the report would provide instructions for
appropriate rewards and disciplinary actions. Central education administration would establish mechanisms
for training and monitoring of the network of inspectors to help them carry out their functions. Central
administration would also adapt, verify, and apply as necessary, the administrative sanctions of the annual
report of inspectors. Of course, these are only possible measures that should be explored to test their
relevance to the context in Mauritania.
Action Plan
There are four interrelated steps:
i)     Establish a technical team to make concrete proposals and prepare guidelines to ensure that the
proposals are relevant and are implemented effectively in the field. Coordinated by the Inspector General
for Secondary and Technical Education (IGEST), the team would be composed of representatives of IPN,
the Inspectorate for Basic Education (IEF), the Directorate of Basic Education (DEF), the Directorate of
Secondary Education (DES), the Directorate of Planning and Cooperation (DPC), and the Directorate for
Education Projects (DPEF). It would also contain two education officials in the field representing the
Regional Directorate of Basic Education (DREF) and the Teachers Training Institute (Ecole Normale
d 'Instituteurs, ENI). The team would meet as often as necessary under the supervision of IGEST and will
- 136-



present the first draft of its conclusions on September 15, 2001.
ii)    Agree and finalize a regulatory document that defines the new structure for the management and
allocation of educational staff and the responsibilities of the various actors (teachers, school principals,
inspectors, DREF, and central education administration).
iii)    Set up these arrangements through information campaigns-distribution of the new measures to
education officials and to the general public.
iv)    Implement the measures selected for a trial period of three years, at the end of which, an evaluation
will be carried out to determine if adjustments and modifications are needed.
HI - Improving the Deployment of Staff
Deployment of educational staff would be viewed as a two-stage process:
* The first stage is to develop school mapping in the largest sense of the term. This includes the
geographical distribution and educational structure of schools, the number of pupils, and the number of
educational divisions, ways of grouping pupils in basic education, the degree of subject specialization
of teachers in secondary education, particularly in lower secondary school. In this instance, the
education system is faced with contradictory goals. First, schools must be large enough to have
acceptable unit costs, and secondly, schools must be close to the target population, which implies that
they must be small. Use of multigrade teaching in basic education and multiple subject teachers in
secondary education would help reduce the tension between these two objectives. Thus, it important to
clarify, first of all, the guiding principles in this area and to define the school map which will provide
the required number of students in the two educational settings.
One problem that is specific to basic education needs to be underscored. The issue of allocating teachers
must not be viewed on the basis of the number of pupils currently enrolled in as much as a substantial
proportion of basic education schools (82%) do not offer the entire six years of complete basic education.
Thus, it is useful to simulate what would be the number of pupils in a school that offered complete basic
education.
* The second stage of the analysis is to determine what inputs and staff would be appropriate to assign to
schools, taking into account selected possibilities for grouping pupils in basic education (use of
multigrade teaching) and the degree of subject specialization (multipurpose) teachers in secondary
education. The analysis in this note focuses on the second stage.
All countries are faced with the issue of how to distribute educational staff and material inputs. No country
operates optimally in this area, either because the formulas used are not entirely appropriate or because
they are not adequately implemented.
Countries which perform best in allocating staff to schools do so because of the following four reasons:
i)    Assignments and transfers of teachers take place between school years rather than during the
school year. Such transfers are certainly possible but they are the exception rather than the norm.
ii)    If management is decentralized, uniform responsibility and common management principles apply.
- 137 -



iii)    Efficiency criteria are defined to ensure that all educational institutions are funded according to
uniform and equitable formulas. These criteria are simple, transparent, and shielded from extemal
influences.
iv)    Staff positions are assigned to structures (schools and educational institutions, service units)
according to the formulas defined above and are not tied directly to the individuals who occupy them.
These criteria can be used to determine priorities for teacher transfers (seniority, service for a given number
of years in a difficult area, considerations of health, uniting husband and wife, professional performance,
etc.).
In so far as the actual management of staff in basic education is the responsibility of the local level (Walli),
one must ensure that (i) assignments of blocks of positions to different willayas conform to equity and
efficiency criteria and (ii) the mechanism and criteria for assigning positions are well known and applied in
each willaya. These two points will be followed up in item (iv) in the action plan below.
Action Plan
Four complementary stages are proposed:
i)     Establish a technical team to make concrete proposals and prepare guidelines to ensure that the
proposals are relevant and are implemented effectively in the field. Coordinated by the Directorate of
Personnel (DP) the team would be composed of representatives of the Inspectorate for Basic Education
(IEF), ,the Directorate of Basic Education (DEF), the Directorate of Secondary Education (DES), and the
Directorate for Planning and Cooperation (DPC). It would also contain two education officials in the field
representing DREF. The team would meet as often as necessary under the management of DP and would
present the first draft of its conclusions on September 15, 2001.
ii)    Agree and finalize a regulatory document that defines the new structure for managing and
allocating staff and that identifies the responsibilities of the different actors at the central government,
DREF, and Wallis levels.
iii)    Set up these arrangements through information campaigns-distribution of the new arrangements
to education officials and to the general public).
iv)    Implement the arrangements selected for a trial period of three years, at the end of which, an
evaluation will be carried out to detennine if adjustments and modifications are needed.

1.        Current Status
Schools. The number of primary schools increased from 1,214 in 1988/89 to 2,798 in 1999/2000,
averaging 76 new schools per year over the last decade. With only 1% of the schools in 1998/999, private
schools play a very limited role. The pace of school construction has increased from 50 classrooms per
annum, at the beginning of the decade, to more than 300 per annum in 1997/98 but has since declined, as
full coverage is getting nearer.

School size. Over the last 20 years, school distribution by the number of classrooms has been surprisingly
stable. In 20 years, the percentage of schools with up to three classrooms has risen from 72% to 75% only.
The percentage of one-classroom schools (recruiting only every 6 years or every 3 years in the case of
multigrade teaching) has remained around 45%, and two-classroom schools have increased from 19% to
22%. Although schools in general are relatively well distributed across the country due to increased
coverage, this is far from being the case for primary schools offering the full 6-grade cycle. Given that
multigrade teaching was practiced only in 924 classrooms in 1998/99, most schools do not offer a full
education cycle, a key determinant in the high dropout rate, in particular for girls who are less likely than
boys to move to another town to pursue schooling.

Classrooms. During the last decade, the number of classrooms has increased by about 4,850 (in both
public and private schools), from 3,356 in 1990/91 to more than 8,000 in 1999/00, averaging 516 new
classrooms per annum. This contrasts with the slower place at the end of the eighties, as the number of
classrooms increased from about 2,565 in 1984/85 to 3,356 in 1990/91, averaging 156 new classrooms per
year. An accelerated pace in classroom building at the turn of the nineties coincides with the launching of a
new approach, "building with the communities". Private schools appeared midway through the nineties,
increasing from 60 classrooms in 1994 to about 400 in 1999/00, a six-fold increase in six years. While
school coverage was improving countrywide, it was worsening in the capital city. The relative number of
classrooms in Nouakchott declined from 13.3% of the total in 1990/91 to 12.6% in 1999/00, while its
population increased during the same period from 20% of the total in 1990 to 24% in 2000.

Occupancy of classrooms. The average occupancy of classroom is high. Averaging 47 students/class at
the beginning of the decade, it peaked at 51-52 in the median years, and declined to 44 at the end of the
decade. In the regions, the lowest occupancy is found in the desert areas of Inchiri, Adrar and Tagant. The
industrial town of Nouadhibou records the highest occupancy (around 75 students per class during the
decade, peaking at 88 in 1996/97) and the capital Nouakchott where it has improved over the last five years
(from nearly 100 students per classroom in 1995/96 to 71 in 1999/00) mainly due to the double shift
system. In other regions, it varies between 36 and 48 students per class.

Physical conditions of classrooms. Physical conditions of classrooms have improved over the last decade.
Along with a very high growth in the number of classrooms (more than 4,650 new classrooms in ten years),
the percentage of permanent structures increased from 58% of the total number of classrooms built in
1990/91 to 69% in 2000/01. This is an important outcome of the Government's strategy to delegate to, and
assist, communities in building classrooms according to national standards. Despite this success, slightly
less than a third of all classrooms (2,355) was still made with non-permanent building materials in
2000/01, including 2,050 classrooms made out of earth-bricks and earth-roof and 305 straw huts and
M'bars.

2.     The Community Approach - Background
Status prior to the Education II Project (Before 1989). In the eighties, the number of classroorns in the
primary education system had an average yearly increase of 175, of which half was built under the
authority of the Ministry for Equipment and Transport (MET). The other half was built spontaneously by
grassroots communities without govenmment intervention. All new classrooms in 1986 and 1987 were built
by communities, as a lack of resources prevented Govemment to do its share. Classrooms built by the
MET used standard plans. Their construction was awarded to building contractors from the modem sector
on the basis of National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures, and cost per classroom amounted to UM
1.25 million, equivalent to US$17,000, or UM 25,000 per square meter, equivalent to US$342. Classrooms
built by communities were smaller (15 to 25 sq. meters), hardly functional, had a short life span (4-5 years)
due to the use of non-permanent materials (walls in earth-bricks and roof in earth on palm tree trunks) and
poorly laid out. The construction of such non-standard classrooms required an average community
investment (labor, kind or money) averaging UM 165,000, equivalent to US$2,250. At the same time,
BREDA, the Regional UNESCO Office, was experimenting with the use of local material for classroom
construction in Mauritania and other Sahelian countries, estimating that the use of plaster (made with
gypsum) in classroom construction could bring the cost down to about US$8,000.
Education III Project Initial Strategy (1989). The project's initial strategy included testing an approach
based on: (i) use of local materials in order to take advantage of local initiatives and skills, (ii) community
training using volunteers, (iii) contributions from the community assessed at 50% of total classroom cost,
then an estimated UM 600,000/classroom, equivalent to $US8,300, and (iv) a pilot test phase limited to
250 classrooms over 5 years, or 50 classrooms/year.
Education III Project Actual Strategy (1990-95). The actual strategy that was implemented starting
1990 was to transfer responsibility for classroom construction to the communities. The rationale for this
strategy was as follows. If communities were to maintain their contributions at least at pre-project level, it
was essential that community ownership remain strong with or without the project. This in tum implied
that: (i) communities become fully responsible the construction, as was the case when they built classrooms
- 141 -



using their own resources; as a corollary the Ministry of Education devolve to communities the
management of Government's 50% cofinancing; (ii) let building decisions to the communities, with the
result that the construction program will be demand-driven; (iii) conceive a standard design simple enough
(no veranda and no ceiling) to prevent resistance by poor communities to the financing of an architectural
model making use of elements deemed non-essential--which communities did not use for their own habitat,
and to limit the cost of its construction to no more than two times the average community investment prior
to the project; (iv) use building technologies familiar to communities and routinely used by informal sector
artisans--which in turn required the idea of using "local material" be abandoned; (v) use a project financing
system that would be transparent, easily understood by communities, and that would make it difficult to
misuse funds; (vi) help communities with technical assistance but not replace them. To provide such
technical assistance, the project recruited highly skilled national experts to replace the originally planned
technical assistance volunteers. As a result, many technical, administrative and social issues, which
expatriate experts could not have properly managed, were successfully addressed on the ground.
Institutional Arrangements between the Project and the Communities. Communities submit their
subprojects for classroom construction using a standard cofinancing request form widely disseminated by
the project. Subprojects are approved by the MEN on the basis of eligibility criteria including: (i)
confornity with the school map, standard plans and technical specifications, and (ii) community
commnitment to build according to standard design and specifications and receive payment of the
Government's subsidy, by tranches, at the end of each of the four phases of the work, as a partial
reimbursement of the construction cost (50% at project beginning). Once requests are approved,
communities sign a cofinancing agreement that determines the amount of each tranche of the subsidy.
Construction work is carried out under the responsibility of the communities, which are also responsible for
the procurement of material, and contracting to an enterprise or specialized workers. Work performance is
monitored by one of the project's "mobile teams" under the supervision of engineer. The latter will also
provide communities with technical advice, and help them use sound procurement practices. He will certify
the confornity of works with the plans and specifications, which will constitute authorization of payment of
the tranche of the subsidy. The project has put in place 3 "mobile teams", each one comprising a civil
engineer and an assistant recruited from the private sector on a competitive basis.
Education III Project Outcomes (1996). Technical and architectural options used in the course of this
project lowered classroom construction costs from UM 460,000 in 1991 to UM 792,500 in 1995 (average
national cost equivalent to US$5,600 in 1991 and US$6,100 in 1995. The community approach was so
successful that IDA funds were fully disbursed in 3 years instead of 5 and that 408 classrooms were built
with these funds instead of 250. With CFD agreement, Government decided in 1993 to allocate
counterpart funds from the French Structural Adjustment Grant to the project. The latter then built
additional 534 classrooms, bringing the total to 942 instead of the 250 originally planned. Up to 1993,
communities had cofinanced 50% of the estimated value, however after the 1994 devaluation, it became
increasingly difficult for rural communities to maintain this level of cofinancing and the level of subsidy
was brought up to 75% in rural areas (where 75% of the subsidized classrooms were located). By the end
of the project, communities had cofinanced 38% of the total cost of the 942 classrooms. The cost of
supervision by the 3 "mobile teams" and management overhead accounted for 15% of construction cost.
Simultaneously GER increased from 38% in 1988-89 to 78% in 1994-95.
Education V Project (1996-2001). This project had estimated that 2,620 classrooms would be needed to
reach a 100% enrollment rate by 1999 (slightly more than 500 classrooms per year). Under IDA financing,
1,430 classrooms were planned in 7 regions considered as disadvantaged in terms of education. Other
donors, such as the CFD, would finance an additional 1,190 classrooms. The projects have planned to have
AMEXTIPE to be the executing agency in Nouakchott and have communities be responsible for
- 142 -



construction in rural areas along organizational arrangements similar to Education III, with a countrywide
uniform level of subsidy of 70% (for urban and rural classrooms). The standard plan for classrooms as
well as the manual of procedures of the previous project were maintained, and the "mobile teams", under
the supervision of regional technical co-coordinators (RTC), continued to provide communities with the
same support and carry out identical works supervision, with a revised contract in which 30% of their fees
were linked to the productivity of the 'mobile team'.
Education V Project Outcomes (2001). In July 2001, because of the devaluation of the national
currency, the project had supported, under IDA financing, the building of 2,237 classrooms instead of the
1,430 originally planned, and under CFD financing, 417 classrooms; the total of 2,654 classrooms being
built by communities with the technical support and under control of the "mobile teams". By July 2001,
more than 1500 classrooms under IDA and 400 under CFD were completed, with the remaining classrooms
to be completed before December 31 2001. Upon completion of the planned classrooms still to be built,
communities will have built a total of more than 3,500 classrooms in 10 years. In 1999, construction costs
were as follows: (a) construction cost in Nouakchott including community contribution: UM699,000
equivalent to US $3,330. With an average distance-coefficient of 38% for classrooms nation-wide, the
average cost of a classroom built under the program is UM965,000, equivalent to US$4,600 (current), or
cost per square meter h.o. of UM17,800, equivalent to US$85 per sq. meter, of which communities
contribute 30%. The level of the costs of supervision by the "mobile teams" remains at 15% of the
construction cost.

According to the technical audit of the construction program under the Education V project, 95% of
constructions are rated "Good" and "Satisfactory" on the basis of a standard 25 years durability criterion;
4% are rated "Poor" and 1% "Bad", requiring a complementary program. After comparing costs of
construction by communities and by AMEXTIPE at the same location (Selibaby), the audit concludes that
classrooms built by AMEXTTIPE are 3 times more expensive than those built by communities: UM
3,348,000 forAMEXTIPE against UM  1,135,000 for communities.
3.     PNDSE Phase 1 Construction Program
Number of students to be accommodated. The objective of the PNDSE construction program is to
support universal enrollment in 2010, i.e developing a capacity able to provide -- in 2004 and after -- an
- 143 -



available place in a school to all children of the country reaching the school intake age. The number of
students enrolled in schools is expected to increase from 346,000 in 1998 to 546,000 in 2010.
Number of classrooms to be built. The number of classrooms to be built was estimated using a
computer-based model to simulate the future sector status under different assumptions for project
objectives and reforms. This number takes into account: (i) multigrade extension, (ii) double shifting, and
(iii) replacement of classrooms built with non-permanent materials.

Coordination of development partners in the construction program. The school construction program
will be financed by a limited number of partners, mainly: (a) Government, first under the Public Investment
Budget, which has benefited from external debt reductions initiatives (HPIC), and, second, under the
Regional Development Fund (FRD) and the Human Rights and Poverty Reduction and Integration
(CDHLCPI); (b) AfDB, and (c) IDA, through its financing of the PNDSE and the Urban Development
Project (UDP). Coordination among donors will be the responsibility of the DPC.
Institutional arrangements. The program is being developed in a context in which competencies of
Communes include "Construction, maintenance and equipment of basic education school facilities"
(Ordinance 87.287, art.2). In addition to this ordinance, a joint departmental circular from the Ministry of
National Education and from the Ministry of the Interior (006/MIPT/MEN/DCL of February 20 1991)
confirms that "Communes must bear expenses of classroom construction and maintenance". It also stresses
that "the Education III project plans to provide municipalities with technical and financial support to help
them improve their investment. Similar support could be provided to all local governments.
Strategy. The strategy is similar to that of prior projects: communities have been given the responsibility
of implementing their classroom construction and equipment subproject, which is cofinanced by the
Government under termns and conditions defined in a cofmancing agreement signed by all eligible
communities and the DPEF. Eligibility and priority criteria have been revised to give higher priority to
incomplete schools aiming at developing a complete school by combining classroom construction and
multigrade teaching. Priority will be given to communities promoting a complete 6-level, 3-classroom
school. The community support program for school construction will be broadened to include: (i)
construction of headmaster's office and storage facilities, (ii) construction of latrines, (iii) classroom
furniture and (iv) wire mesh fencing in rural areas and permanent fencing in urban areas. The level of
subsidy for classroom construction remains at 70% as in the past, and at 100% for the new complementary
facilities. The manual of procedures has been adjusted accordingly and will be finalized by credit
effectiveness. The revised manual will spell out the specific procedures communities should follow for
material procurement, recruitment of specialized labor or contracting with local enterprises. These
- 144 -



procedures reflect Bank's experience in conmmunity procurement in other countries and other projects such
as social funds. The Program organization is illustrated in the diagram hereafter.
Estimated cost. In July 2001, the nationwide average cost of a classroom was estimated at UMI1,215,000
(including a 30% community contribution), equivalent to US$4,730. The reference cost of a classroom in
Nouakchott is UM880,000, equivalent to US$3,425, excluding complementary facilities.
