                         care services have been prepared and approved by #The National Board for Development, Assessment and Implementation of National Recommendation for Clinical Practice
                         (Guidelines) and State Standards for Disease Management (Protocols)#. And, 550 PHC doctors have received training on the application of these guidelines. Under Component 2,

                         health system. Nationwide launching of the strategy is expected by Fall of 2011. The development of the Social Information Management System (SIMS) to provide consolidated
                         automated information about all the registered beneficiaries of the government-funded medical insurance programs, as well as of beneficiaries getting social assistance from the
                         different programs managed by the Ministry of Labor, Health and Social Affairs (MOLHSA), is also progressing well.
