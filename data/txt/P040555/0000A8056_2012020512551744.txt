                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Reflecting the overall implementation of the health reform program in the country, and more specifically the status of project implementation since it was restructured in March 2009,
                         the overall implementation progress of the project continues to be rated satisfactory (S). The latter decision by the mission reflects the clearly defined policy and institutional reform
                         orientation by the Ministry of Labor, Health and Social Assistance (MOLHSA), results achieved, and compliance with agreements reached during the implementation support mission
                         earlier in 2011. Main areas of focus during the last 6 months of project implementation are the health management information system and the implementation report.
