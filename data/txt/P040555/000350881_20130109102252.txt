F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to improve coverage and utilization of quality primary
health care (PHC) based on a model of Family Medicine/General Practice, especially for the poor and
disadvantaged.
Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The revised PDO includes a new objective relating to the strengthening of the stewardship functions of
the Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Affairs (MoLHSA). The revised PDO aimed to (a) improve
coverage, utilization, and quality of health care services in the territory of the Recipient; and (b)
strengthen the government’s stewardship functions in the health sector.

1.        Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.      The Primary Health Care Development Project was approved by the International Development
Association (IDA) on August 1, 2002, for the amount of SDR 16.1 million (US$ 20.3 million
equivalent). 1 The credit agreement was signed on November 8, 2002, and the credit became effective on
May 6, 2003. The project was initially planned for implementation within five years, with an original
closing date of December 31, 2007. However, due to problems faced during implementation, the project
was extended several times. 2 Moreover, as a result of frequent changes in health sector policy directions,
the project was restructured, with an effective date of July 2, 2011 3. The project was the second health
project for Georgia implemented by the IDA. 4 The project’s preparation was supported by a trust fund
agreement with the Japanese Policy and Human Development Resources Development Fund, signed on
January 31, 1997.
1.1       Context at Appraisal
2.      Prior to independence, Georgia enjoyed one of the highest standards of living in the former Soviet
Union. The economy was traditionally based on Black Sea tourism, viticulture, agriculture, and some
mining (mainly manganese and copper). However, separation from the Soviet economic system,
combined with the rapid introduction of a market economy and armed conflicts, left the country in a state
of economic collapse, severely reducing the resources available for the health sector. 5 From 1990 to 1994,
gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 68 percent and in 1993 inflation was over 1,500 percent. 6 However,
after 1994, the economic situation improved rapidly, with an average growth rate of 8 percent per year,
while inflation remained stable (table 1).
3.        Challenges encountered at appraisal are outlined in the following paragraphs.

3 Pursuant to the Decree #4983-RS dated July 1, 2011 of the Parliament of Georgia, the Amendment to the
Amended and Restated Financing Agreement of May 20, 2009 was ratified on July 1, 2011.

 The first IDA health project (US$ 14 million) for Georgia became effective in 1996 and closed in 2002. Another
project, the Structural Reform Support Project (US$ 16 million), with a hospital restructuring component, was
approved in 1999 and closed in 2007.

4.      Decline in health expenditure as percentage of total public expenditure. In the early 1990s,
health expenditure as a percentage of total public expenditure declined from 13.2 percent in 1991 to 0.54
percent in 1994. In real terms, the government was spending less than a dollar per capita in 1994
(US$ 0.81) compared with US$ 10 per capita in 1991. This sharp decline in public health expenditure led
to the eventual collapse of the system. Out-of-pocket payments for services received became widespread
and resulted in financial access barriers for most of the population. In 2000, Georgia spent approximately
220.3 million Georgian lari (GEL) on health care, of which approximately 73 percent came from private
out-of-pocket payments and 27 percent from public expenditure. This amounted to 3.9 percent of GDP,
equivalent to 41 GEL or US$ 20 per person. Of out-of-pocket payments, 53 percent was spent on
medicines and the remainder on medical consultations.
5.       Low utilization of health services by Georgians. Georgians recorded less than three outpatient
visits per person per year, and the inpatient admission rate was 4.3 percent in 1999 (down from 5.3
percent in 1995). There were also differences between urban and rural areas, and in the rural and high
mountain areas outpatient visits were less than one per capita. Most Georgians tended to bypass the health
system and self-treat on the basis of drugs purchased over the counter in pharmacies, and only sought
professional help when absolutely necessary (for emergency care). Preventive and primary health care
(PHC)-seeking behaviors were largely absent in the vast majority of the population.


                                                               2
6.        Deteriorating quality of services and lack of access to basic health care. After independence,
the health system that Georgia inherited from the Soviet Union consisted of a large number of health
facilities (especially hospitals) and health personnel (especially specialists). Under the Soviet health care
system, the majority of the population bypassed the PHC system and sought services at hospitals. For
some groups in Georgia, especially because of poor access to quality health care, a severe problem
resulted, particularly in populations from rural and high mountain areas. They also faced geographic and
financial barriers to seeking care. The proposed project directly addressed this problem by supporting
investments in PHC in rural and high mountain areas, and by supporting health care financing
arrangements that would enable the urban poor to seek services.
7.       Inefficient, fragmented, and specialized health care delivery system. The Georgian health
system was highly fragmented and focused on inefficient, hospital-based, specialized care. In the absence
of an adequate PHC system, basic services were provided in specialized hospitals and polyclinics. The
protocol on which this delivery system was based was also outdated and greatly contributed to the
inefficiency of the health system. The proposed project aimed at shifting the orientation of the health
system toward preventive care and realigning the rest of the system to support primary care. It also
planned to support restructuring and downsizing of existing PHC infrastructures in the country, and to
realign, retrain, and redeploy health personnel based upon the current needs in the country.
8.       Distortions in health care financing. There were specific health care financing problems facing
Georgia, including the need to increase public expenditure on health and to improve the allocation and
technical efficiency of that expenditure, and the need to encourage the mobilization of private spending
on health care through risk-pooling arrangements, reducing informal payments in the health sector. The
proposed project supported more efficient allocation of financing by ensuring that public expenditure was
targeted toward PHC, especially in the rural and high mountain areas. It provided the foundation for
improving technical efficiency by establishing and strengthening PHC, thereby enabling the government
of Georgia to shift resources for the delivery of basic health services from the hospital to the ambulatory
clinic setting. At the time of project design, utilization rates for health facilities, especially ambulatories,
were extremely low in Georgia. This was mostly related to the extremely poor condition of the facilities,
lack of heating during winter months, and outdated medical equipment. The condition of rural and high
mountain ambulatories was particularly dire. Supporting the upgrade of those facilities would create
opportunities for mobilizing out-of-pocket payments, even if they were small. Finally, the project aimed
to ensure that doctors were better paid, and in the process it was expected that informal out-of-pocket
payments would become less of an issue.

9.      Lack of an appropriate policy and regulatory framework for PHC. There was no policy and
legal basis for the application of PHC through family medicine (for example in solo or family group
practices), or for the regulation of PHC. It was necessary for these systems to be in place if a PHC system
was to be developed countrywide. Hence a substantial investment was required for the establishment of a
PHC network. It was necessary to ensure that the legal conditions for establishing PHC institutions were
in place. At the same time, it was necessary to ensure that the Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social
Affairs (MoLHSA) had the capacity to appropriately regulate those facilities. For the reasons already
mentioned, the project made a strategic choice to support the expansion of PHC services in Georgia,
especially in rural and high mountain areas, and create a policy and regulatory framework for sustainable
financing and delivery of PHC services.
                                                       3
10.     Changed organizational structure of health care sector. The role of the Ministry of Health
(now called the Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Affairs) had shifted from the direct delivery of
health services to policy making, regulation, and execution of public health functions. The Ministry was
represented at the regional level by regional public health departments. In addition, municipalities had
their own health departments, which were independent yet coordinated with the Ministry.
1.2       Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
11.      The original project development objective (PDO) was to improve coverage and utilization of
quality primary health care (PHC) based on a model of family medicine and general practice, especially
for the poor and disadvantaged.
12.     The wording of the PDO was slightly different in the main text of the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) and in Annex 1 of the PAD. Moreover, the agreed minutes of negotiations (May 8,
2002) listed different sets of outcome and impact indicators. Although the wording varied slightly in the
Development Credit Agreement (DCA), the difference in wording did not alter the substance.
13.     The wording and the quantity of key performance indicators in the main text of the PAD (page 2)
differed from those in Annex 1 of the project design summary (page 34). The list of key performance
indicators in the main text of the PAD comprised 11 indicators, while Annex 1 listed 10.
14.      The achievement of the PDO was to be measured by the following key performance indicators as
identified in the PAD, Annex 1:
      •   Approximately 50 percent of the population with access to a PHC clinic within 30 minutes of
          walking/other transportation;
      •   Population with access to PHC completing at least three visits per capita per year;
      •   30 percent increase in the number of ARI/DD cases managed at the PHC level;
      •   20 percent increase in the proportion of infants in the population that receive immunization
          (DPT3) on time;
      •   30 percent increase in the proportion of pregnant women who have had at least 4 prenatal visits;
      •   50 percent increase in the proportion of adult patients seen in refurbished PHC clinics from whom
          blood pressure is recorded in patients’ medical records;
      •   Improved knowledge and practice of practices related to health lifestyles (smoking, diet,
          wellbeing check-ups);
      •   20 percent increase in the number of cases managed according to internationally and nationally
          approved treatment guidelines;
      •   40 percent increase in the number of appropriate referrals;
      •   30 percent decrease in the number of ARI/DD cases referred to the hospital.

1.3        Revised PDO and Key Indicators
15.     After restructuring in 2009 7, the revised PDO included a new objective relating to the
strengthening of the stewardship functions of MoLHSA. The revised PDO was designed to (a)
improve coverage, utilization, and quality of health care services in the territory of the Recipient;
and (b) strengthen the government’s stewardship functions in the health sector.
16.     During the midterm review that took place in May 2007, the Bank’s team, with the
government of Georgia, explored ways in which the project could have been more responsive to
changes in the government’s strategy in the health sector. The radical policy changes, with a full-
scale privatization of health services and finance functions, had direct implications for the types
of investments the Bank-financed project was supporting. The government decided to
discontinue the rehabilitation of PHC facilities, but to increase funds for training in family
medicine, revision of guidelines, strengthening of MoLHSA’s stewardship function, and
developing a social management information system.
17.     During the restructuring mission in July 2008, the project was reappraised and recosted.
As a result of the restructuring mission, revisions were proposed to the original project objectives
and the project title (from “Primary Health Care Development Project? to “Health Sector
Development Project?), and changes were made in the key outcome indicators in the results
framework. A thorough assessment was made of all outcome and output indicators in the results
framework and a set of new indicators were proposed to improve the linkage between project
activities and the results framework. In total, 10 out of 17 indicators were modified, 7 were
dropped, and another 17 indicators were added.
18.        Revised PDO indicators were: 8
      •    Percentage of population covered with retrained family medicine providers;
      •    Percentage of rural population with access to a PHC clinic within 30 minutes of
           transportation/ walking
      •    Increased immunization rate of DPT3;

      •    Increased awareness of population on health care reforms.
1.4        Main Beneficiaries
19.     Direct beneficiaries of the project investments were the communities benefiting from the
scaling up of the PHC development program and the population served by the hospital and
modernized social information management system, which enables the social services to be more
efficient and effective. The key beneficiaries included (a) the population of Georgia in general
and particularly vulnerable groups (for example those living in rural and high mountain areas,
women, children, and the elderly); (b) MoLHSA and the Ministry of Finance as well as the
various institutions subordinated to the ministries, such as the Social Service Agency, the
National Center for Disease Control and Public Health, and the National Health Management
Center; (c) academic institutions, such as the Postgraduate Medical Academy, Tbilisi Medical
University, the Caucasus University School of Business, the University of Georgia, and family
medicine training centers in Tbilisi and in the regions; and (d) physicians, nurses, other health
professionals, managers, policy makers, and other stakeholders.
1.5        Original Components (As Approved)
20.        The project before restructuring had the following components:
Component 1: PHC service delivery (US$ 16.2 million total, including contingencies, 65
percent of total budget)
21.    The objective of this component was to support the phased development of PHC services
in urban and rural areas of Georgia through rehabilitation of facilities and provision of basic
medical and office equipment. It was to be implemented in two phases. The proposed project
planned to support development of PHC clinics in up to 74 rural and high mountain areas and
carry out one urban PHC referral pilot during phase I. The identification of health facilities to be
developed under phase II was dependent on the accomplishments of phase I and the lessons
learned from the urban pilots. The component consisted of three subcomponents:
           Subcomponent 1.1: Expansion of PHC services in urban and rural areas 10

    DOT = directly observed therapy.

                                                   6
           Subcomponent 1.2: PHC referral pilot
           Subcomponent 1.3: Community-based information, education, and communication (IEC)
Component 2: Institutional development (US$ 7.1 million total, including contingencies, 29
percent of total budget)
22.    The overall objective of this component was to support capacity building and institutional
development in training, the policy framework and regulatory environment of PHC, and the
management of PHC services, especially through an integrated health management information
system. The key government institutions involved in this component included the Public Health
Department 11 of MoLHSA and the Family Medicine Faculty at the Postgraduate Medical
Academy. This component consisted of four subcomponents:
           Subcomponent 2.1: Capacity building for PHC training
           Subcomponent 2.2: Capacity building in the management of PHC services
           Subcomponent 2.3: Strengthening health management information system for PHC
           Subcomponent 2.4: Support for PHC financing reforms
Component 3: Project management support (US$ 1.5 million total, including contingencies, 6
percent of total budget)
23.      The objective of this component was to support project implementation by ensuring that
(a) project activities are well coordinated; (b) issues affecting or that could potentially impact
project implementation are identified in a timely manner; (c) there is a sound technical basis for
project activities, developed in accordance with the requirements of the project beneficiaries;
(d) necessary project inputs are provided in a timely and cost-efficient manner; (e) project
resources are appropriately managed in accordance with Bank requirements for procurement and
financial management; (f) effective project monitoring and progress reporting is carried out; and
(g) there is systematic outreach to various stakeholders to promote the transparency of project
activities and the achievement of project objectives. To meet this objective the component would
support the development and functioning of the Health and Social Projects Implementation
Center (HSPIC).
1.6        Revised Components
24.        After restructuring the components were as follows:




10
     This subcomponent is also labeled “Establishing PHC clinics and referral laboratories? in parts of the PAD.

11
     Currently renamed as the National Center for Disease Control and Public Health.

                                                            7
Component 1: Strengthening PHC system
25.      Subcomponent 1.1: Upgrading health clinics. The objective of this subcomponent was
to increase access to critical PHC services. The subcomponent planned to finance the following
activities: (a) rehabilitation of health clinics, including a reference laboratory; (b) provision of
equipment for clinics and family doctors; (c) rehabilitation and equipment of Kutaisi Maternal
and Child Health Center; and (d) equipment for avian influenza resuscitation units and antiviral
drugs for avian influenza.
26.     Subcomponent 1.2: PHC training. The objective of this subcomponent was to
strengthen capacity in PHC and improve the quality of care, through (a) rehabilitation and
equipment of five regional family medicine training centers; (b) establishment of the Family
Medicine Faculty; (c) development of clinical guidelines and an undergraduate nursing education
curriculum; (d) provision of training for PHC providers in family medicine, clinical guidelines,
and contract negotiation and management skills; and (e) provision of training on maternal and
child care and health management to health practitioners and managers.
Component 2: Support for health sector reform
27.    Subcomponent 2.1: Information and communication campaign. The objective of this
subcomponent was to increase awareness and understanding among the population of the
government’s health reform program. Specifically, this included information on programs for the
poor, privatization of health facilities, contracting with private insurance, and developing the
contents of the benefit package. The subcomponent planned to finance the design and
implementation of the information and communication campaign throughout Georgia.
28.      Subcomponent 2.2: Capacity building for MoLHSA in policy, regulation, financing,
and monitoring and evaluation. The objective was to support development of the capacity of
MoLHSA to analyze and monitor the sector as a basis for a “steering? rather than “rowing?
stewardship role. This subcomponent would finance the following activities: (a) strengthening
the capacity of the Health Policy Division in MoLHSA; (b) institutionalizing monitoring and
evaluation (M&E); (c) supporting the development of regulatory capacity; (d) developing and
institutionalizing national health accounts; (e) carrying out a health sector performance
assessment; (f) providing technical assistance on health financing reforms; and (g) conducting an
impact evaluation of the Medical Assistance Program for the Poor.
29.     Subcomponent 2.3: Strengthening health management information system. The
objective was to support the development of the health management information system.
Specifically, this included (a) rehabilitating and equipping the Center for Medical Statistics,
which has been merged with the National Center for Disease Control and Public Health; (b)
technical assistance to analyze the existing flows of health-related information and to develop a
conceptual framework, and to conduct a bankable feasibility study, including an implementation
plan for a future system of health information management at the national level; and (c) design of
the health management information system.
                                                 8
Component 3: Project management
30.     This component would continue to support effective administration and coordination of
the project. This includes managing the project resources, procuring goods and services under
the project, operating the financial management system, and ensuring timely and appropriate
reporting.
31.     Table 2 gives a summary of the project components before and after restructuring.

1.7     Other Significant Changes
32.   There was one major restructuring, four extensions, and two amendments to the credit
agreement:




                                                         9
33.     Project restructuring was requested by the government of Georgia on October 20, 2008 12.
The project was restructured in March 2009, while the Parliament of Georgia ratified the
Amended and Restated Financing Agreement on June 1, 2011. The project title, PDO, design,
and results framework were revised. In addition, categories of expenditure were consolidated
into one category to allow for the percentage of expenditure to be financed at 100 percent under
a single new category combining works, goods, technical assistance, training, and incremental
operating costs.
34.       A total of four project extensions included the following:
      •   Original closing date: December 31, 2007
      •   First extension: December 31, 2009
      •   Second extension: December 31, 2010
      •   Third extension: December 31, 2011
      •   Fourth extension: June 30, 2012.
35.       In addition, two amendments were made to the financing agreement:
      •   An amendment based on the government of Georgia’s letter dated October 19, 2007,
          requesting certain changes regarding a special deposit subaccount at the Treasury Service
          under the Ministry of Finance, became effective on December 10, 2007. Section 1.02 and
          section 2.02 were amended for the purposes of the project to open and maintain a US$-
          denominated special deposit subaccount to the Treasury Service special foreign currency
          account held at the National Bank of Georgia with terms and conditions satisfactory to
          the IDA.
      •   A major restructuring of the project took place in 2009 on based on the government of
          Georgia’s letter dated October 20, 2008. Following issues were revised - the PDO and
          results framework, project components and title, the credit proceeds, procurement plan
          and prior review thresholds, extension of the closing date by 12 months (Closing date set
          as December 31, 2010).
      •   An amendment based on the government of Georgia’s letter dated June 2, 2011,
          requesting certain changes regarding project management support through the National
          Center for Disease Control and Public Health (instead of the HSPIC) and amendments to
          section I (A3 and A4) under schedule 2 on institutional and implementation arrangements.
          The amendments became effective on June 6, 2011.



12
  Restructuring mission took place in July 9-17, 2008; MoLHSA requested restructuring in October 9, 2008, MoF
requested restructuring in October 20, 2008.

                                                      10
      •   In February 5, 2011 final extension was granted to the project to finalize certain activities
          related to the social information management system development. Closing date set as
          June 30, 2012.
2.        Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1       Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
36.     The ICR team rated the design and quality at entry as Moderately Satisfactory on the
basis of the following premises:
37.     Appropriateness of background analysis. The project’s main focus was on institutional,
structural, and financial issues faced by Georgia’s health system, and efforts to modernize were
based on evidence that the main adverse effects of the system on the most vulnerable were
(a) high out-of-pocket payments affecting access; and (b) dilapidated infrastructure and
equipment and inadequately trained staff, resulting in low quality of services. This premise was
based on a sound analysis of (a) lessons from the design and implementation of Bank support to
health sector development in Europe and Central Asia and the experience from the first Bank-
supported health projects; (b) analytical work to inform project preparation; (c) application of
lessons based on the review of analytical work related to experience with hospital optimization in
other countries of Europe and Central Asia; (d) consistency with government and Bank
strategies; (e) complementarity with other Bank-supported projects and programs, including the
structural adjustment credit programs containing policy benchmarks on improved public
spending; and (f) complementarity with other activities supporting PHC reform financed by
development partners, for example the United Kingdom Department for International
Development (DFID), the European Union, and the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID).
38.     Assessment of project design. Project preparation was supported by technical assistance
financed under a Policy and Human Development Resources Development Fund grant, which
helped the government of Georgia develop detailed project design. In addition, several studies of
the economic and health sectors provided important insights into barriers to utilization of health
services among the poor, helping to shape the design of the project. The studies included
(a) poverty assessment and its updates; (b) public expenditure review; (c) the government’s
health care strategies; and (d) interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for Georgia, as
discussed by the Board in January 2002. The design was appropriate to health sector needs and
consistent with the country’s development strategy to implement programs for poverty
alleviation. The project was assessed by the Quality Assurance Group (fall, 2002) for quality at
entry and received a Highly Satisfactory rating.
39.    Incorporation of lessons learned from other projects. The project design incorporates
lessons learned from the implementation of Bank-financed projects in Georgia and PHC projects
in Europe and Central Asia that have focused on family medicine. Before this project started in

                                                   11
Georgia, the Bank was already assisting a number of countries (including Armenia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Poland, and Tajikistan) in implementing
activities to support PHC, while incorporating lessons learned from the 1999 Operations
Evaluation Department review of health, nutrition, and population lending. The project also drew
lessons from pilots implemented in the Europe and Central Asia region: in the Kyrgyz Republic,
for example, the pilot establishing family medicine clinics and testing provider payment reforms
was implemented in one oblast and then replicated in a phased manner throughout the country. In
general, pilots can be extremely useful in implementing complex reforms, as they allow time to
show results and provide opportunities for enhancing stakeholder participation and interest. This
lesson was taken into account in the design of the project in Georgia, and the implementation of
family medicine in urban areas was planned for phase II (2005) when the results from the DFID-
supported project in Tbilisi confirmed it to be a success. In addition, there were also projects
piloting innovative community health insurance schemes for PHC in rural areas, funded by
USAID through the International Medical Corps. The information from these pilots was
incorporated into this project.
40.     More efficient allocation of project resources. One of the key lessons learned from the
implementation of the first health project in Georgia was not to allocate project resources over a
large number of inputs. In the first health project, this led to a situation where components were
facing funding problems and visible results were not achieved. The Health Sector Development
Project has taken this lesson into account by focusing on the phased development of PHC, and
linking each phase to clear and easy-to-monitor achievements.
41.     Appropriate project objectives, scope, and institutional arrangements. In the view of
the ICR team, the project’s aims and scope were appropriate for the stage of development of the
health sector in the country and were built on experience within Georgia and the region. The
investment vehicle was appropriate given the scope of reforms to be pursued and the
commitment of the government of Georgia and the Bank to work together in further developing
the sector. Further, the project was consistent with the objectives of the 1997 Country Assistance
Strategy 13 , which focused on alleviating poverty through improving access to quality health
services for vulnerable groups and improving the efficient use of limited resources. The project
objectives were directly linked to one of the main objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy.
42.     Proper risk assessment. Project risks, rated overall as substantial at appraisal, were
properly identified and adequate mitigation measures incorporated into the project. The PAD
identified four risks from outputs to objective and five risks from components to outputs. The
risk assessment assumptions made from the appraisal reflected experience with implementation
of health reform in the country with support from the first Bank-financed health project and the



13
     Document #17000-GE

                                               12
fragile economic situation of the country. The mitigation measures were adequately identified
and successfully applied during implementation.
43.    Effective policy dialogue and stakeholder involvement. Provision was made for
technical assistance, workshops, surveys, and policy formulation at various levels of the health
system. Health reforms supported by the project and the health aspects of operations under the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper were closely supervised by the same Bank health team, thus
ensuring that the policy dialogue with all stakeholders was consistent and linked to the overall
macro-level dialogue between the Bank and the government of Georgia.
2.2     Implementation
44.      The ICR team rated implementation as Moderately Satisfactory. Despite all the
challenges that the project faced during implementation, it managed to achieve all activities as
initially planned (see details in Annex 2, and data sheet). Although the project was rated as
Unsatisfactory in the first year of implementation, it was never considered at risk during
implementation. After restructuring, the project mostly achieved all stated objectives, with the
exception of utilization of the outpatient services 14 by the poor and the general population. Low
utilization can be explained by the fact that the Medical Insurance Program for the Poor (MIP)
did not include much on the PHC side, and whatever was included did not make sense because
drugs were not free. Another factor was removal of financial access barriers toward hospital
services, where quality was better and drugs were also covered. This most likely drove the
insured population toward hospitals and away from PHC. One more reason might be the absence
of the doctors at the PHC facilities when patients need them the most, as working hours are
limited to early afternoon.
45.     Since project restructuring an improving trend has been observed, especially for the poor.
Overall, from the total of 12 years of the project’s lifespan, implementation was rated as
Satisfactory for six years and Moderately Satisfactory for five years, with only the first year
rating of implementation as Unsatisfactory. From 2005, the project was well managed and had a
rating of Satisfactory for implementation progress and progress toward achieving development
objectives. Financial management and project management were constantly rated as Satisfactory.
46.    The good performance of the project reflects the strong leadership by MoLHSA in
guiding the project from its inception and effective supervision and guidance by the Bank team.
During project implementation, the Minister of Labor, Health, and Social Affairs changed eight
times. Almost all ministers fully acknowledged the importance of the project in supporting health
reforms and demonstrated strong commitment to its objectives. In addition, the effective and


14
  The Health Utilization and Expenditure Survey analysis, carried out twice, does not account for all factors as it
only considered the crude numbers, without adjusting for age, sex, and other differences between the two rounds of
surveys.

                                                        13
efficient coordination efforts by the HSPIC in all aspects of project administration were crucial
to ensuring efficient and timely completion of activities. Implementation was successful in most
ways and proved less successful in a limited number of other cases.
Positive Factors and Events That Influenced Project Outcomes
47.      Contribution to Georgian health reforms. The project contributed to the successful
implementation of many aspects of health reforms in Georgia. It was the first project that helped
the government of Georgia to implement PHC reforms. With the support of the project, new
professions emerged, with a full scope of services and financing mechanisms enabling those who
were engaged in these new professions to provide adequate quality services to local populations.
By the completion date, approximately half of the Georgian population was covered by newly
trained PHC doctors and nurses. The percentage of rural populations with access to a PHC
facility within 30 minutes of travel (walking or transport) was achieved in excess by the project
(planned 50 percent, actual result 78 percent). The project has been instrumental in supporting
government efforts to accelerate the pace of health reforms in general and most specifically in
PHC, particularly its efforts to (a) expand the retraining and residency training programs for
PHC doctors and nurses (table 3); (b) further broaden the role of family medicine and the scope
of services delivered; (c) introduce more flexible contracts with purchasers; (d) increase
remuneration for family medicine personnel; (e) place more emphasis on evidence-based
medicine; and (f) develop PHC infrastructures through civil works and the provision of modern
and up-to-date equipment.

48.     Establishment of new faculty with the support of the project. The Family Medicine
Faculty is entirely integrated in the State Medical University structure and staffed with trained
instructors. The Faculty is a member of the European Association of Trainers (EUROACT).
Additionally, the Faculty, with the assistance of the project and in close collaboration with
EUROACT and the World Organization of Family Doctors (WONCA) 15 , developed the
curriculum for teachers in family medicine. The Family Medicine Faculty provides training for

 The acronym is derived from the full name of the organization: World Organization of National Colleges,
Academies and Academic Associations of General Practitioners/Family Physicians

                                                      14
undergraduates and residents in family medicine, training of trainers, and clinical skills training
for family physicians. The Faculty is also heavily involved in the development and
implementation of modern clinical guidelines and treatment protocols.
49.     Promotion of nursing education. The project was instrumental in building the nursing
education system in Georgia. The qualification has been upgraded to a Bachelor’s degree with
the introduction of the new curriculum in five medical education institutions, three in Tbilisi and
two in Adjara. All these education facilities have received national accreditation for conducting
nursing education, with a first cohort of students in 2011.
50.     Quality of PHC services. Another successful intervention of the project was the
provision of administrative and financial support to MoLHSA for the development of clinical
practice guidelines and the creation of a strong regulatory basis. A total of 20 new guidelines
were developed and distributed as a result. The training provided to health personnel from the
project targeted areas was carried out accordingly (table 4).

51.    Evidence-based medicine. Moreover, the project facilitated and financially supported
the collaboration between MoLHSA and the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence in order to share experience and expertise in creation and development of guidelines.
Consequently, a manual for guideline preparation and a model “Stroke? guideline and protocols
were developed. The manual has been acknowledged as a standard methodology for developing
guidelines.
                                                      15
52.     Human resource strengthening in policy decisions. To increase the MoLHSA’s
stewardship and regulatory oversight of private health insurance companies, the World Bank
team helped organize in early 2011 so called South-South knowledge exchange activities for
high-level Georgian officials. These activities focused on facilitating learning about Chile’s
experience in establishing and operating a superintendency for health insurance organizations
through first-hand accounts of health sector regulatory approaches that could not be fulfilled by a
theoretical sector report or Bank-provided technical assistance. Chile’s experiences in
liberalizing its health sector and strengthening health sector regulation were directly relevant to
Georgia’s challenges and state of development.
53.      Health care sector strategy development. With World Bank support and under the
funding of the project, a high-level task force comprising public and private officials was
established for the preparation in 2011 of a five-year health strategy entitled “Affordable and
Quality Health Care.? This strategy, the first since 1999, was a milestone in Georgia’s ambitious
health reform program, and summarized what has been achieved, the challenges ahead, and
options to address them. The strategy, which is a framework for action, reflects the government’s
strong commitment to continue redesigning the health system, strengthening policies and
institutions, and improving the health status of Georgians by adopting multisectoral actions. The
strategy was launched at a high-level event that took place in November 2011.
54.    Support for evidence-based policy making and decision making. Surveys carried out
by the project included an impact evaluation for the MIP, 16 the Health Utilization and
Expenditure Survey, and pharmaceutical policy documents. The project financed the first round
of the MIP impact evaluation in 2009, which revealed improved access to and utilization of
services by the poor and a decrease in out-of-pocket payments for health services. However, no
change was found in pharmaceutical expenditure. The government revised the insurance package
by adding pharmaceutical benefits and introduced them in 2010 based on these findings. With
regard to supporting evidence-based policy development, the Health Policy Unit developed a
pharmaceutical policy paper in 2005. Based on these national pharmaceutical policy
recommendations, an Essential Drug List was approved, based on World Health Organization
(WHO) guidelines. The Essential Drug List was used by the government for the design of the
MIP pharmaceutical benefit in 2010. In 2009, the government of Georgia amended the
pharmaceutical legislation to allow parallel imports of medicines, thus increasing market
competition and the gradual decrease in pharmaceutical prices. In response to the new legislation,




16
  The MIP was first initiated as a pilot in Tbilisi and Imereti regions in 2007 and was further expanded on a national
scale in 2008.

                                                         16
access to medicine has improved, prices of original brand medicines have decreased, and the
markup on brand medicines has been substantially reduced. 17
55.     Strengthening capacity for evaluation of health sector performance. The project
supported the development of the health sector performance assessment (HSPA) in close
collaboration with WHO experts and HSPA working groups at MoLHSA. Georgia was one of
the pilot countries for HSPA and the Georgian HSPA report was presented at the WHO regional
office in Copenhagen. It was the first among all pilot countries to publish and present this report
to WHO and to a wide range of stakeholders in 2009. In addition, Georgia has been
acknowledged as the only country in the region able to institutionalize a National Health
Account (NHA) and make use of it for evidence-based policy development. 18 The development
of the NHA in Georgia began in 2003, and was fully institutionalized by a government of
Georgia decree of January 18, 2006. The NHA has been used to (a) examine health financing
policy issues; (b) allocate government health care funding to priority services and population;
(c) compute policy-related indicators, including per capita health spending and health
expenditure as a percentage of GDP; (d) plan a health care budget (medium-term expenditure
framework 2006–2010); 19 (e) prepare reports on the distribution of health payments and
catastrophic expenditure; (f) by investors to plan hospital expenditure and revenues in hospital
privatization processes; and (g) to develop strategies for HIV/AIDS, TB, and reproductive health.
56.     Efficient management of all social benefits. After restructuring, one of the main
achievements of the project was to develop a modern, comprehensive information management
tool for the Social Service Agency, which currently serves 2.6 million clients per year. Today, 37
percent of the population receives one type of benefit or another from the Social Service Agency,
whose share of the State budget is 28 percent. However, the Agency has at least seven distinct
databases and up to 40 to 60 percent duplication of data between these systems. This not only
lowers data quality but it impacts the Agency’s ability to serve the public. The social information
management systems (SIMS) was conceived to unify these data silos, migrate and clean old data,
and form a “one-stop shop? for Georgian citizens when dealing with the Social Service Agency.
The social information management system follows the “single source of truth? principle by
connecting in real time to authoritative sources of data, for example the Civil Registry Agency
for passport data, without duplication, thereby increasing quality of data access and retrieval.

Once complete, the social information management system will connect to five different
ministries through the Data Exchange Agency in real time, meaning that citizens do not have to
go to separate agencies for data when applying for benefits, reducing the time it takes to deliver
benefits. Development of the system has been completed under the project, and the
implementation stage has been handed over to MoLHSA.
57.     Strengthening human resource capacity. Staff interviewed in several institutions
during completion of the ICR enthusiastically acknowledged the positive role the project had had
in strengthening PHC services and improving the quality, safety, and effectiveness of their work.
The training presented opportunities for PHC staff to exchange experiences and learn new
techniques. They are able to be more productive and the quality of their work has improved. The
opportunity to be exposed to international best practices was also widely acknowledged as being
a positive element of the project. In addition, the opportunity to formulate evidence-based
policies provided enabling capacity for the achievement of project outcomes despite numerous
changes experienced in the direction of health sector reforms.
Less Effective Factors and Events That Influenced the Project’s Outcomes
58.    Frequent changes in Ministry leadership. Over the course of the project (2003–2011),
leadership in MoLHSA changed eight times, often accompanied by reorganization. These events
negatively affected timely decision-making processes as well as project implementation.
Implementation was often held in abeyance while emphasis was devoted to rebuilding project
ownership by the new leadership in the restructured Ministry.
59.    Radical changes in the direction of health sector reforms. The government initiated
the privatization of PHC by selling existing facilities to staff. The government decree 20 was
intended to provide rural doctors with cash grants of 2,000 GEL and to equip them with a set of
basic equipment (at an estimated cost of 4,300 GEL each). As a result of the PHC reform
amendments, although the government intended to use project funds to procure 740 standard
PHC equipment packages worth US$ 3 million for rural doctors, the plan was subsequently
changed. The project did procure and finance 102 equipment packages, while the remainder was
financed by the European Union, with additional funding from the national budget.
60.    Unfinished agenda for the Kutaisi Maternal and Child Health Center. The project
has partially renovated selected wards in the Kutaisi Maternal and Child Health Center
connected with the provision of prenatal services. These wards have been provided with medical
equipment. The training plan for staff was developed and the selection of instructors completed.
However, in line with hospital privatization reforms, MoLHSA refrained from using project

funds to finance training. Subsequently this subcomponent was dropped during the March 2009
restructuring and remaining funds were reallocated to other subcomponents.
61.    Changes in HSPIC leadership and staff. Based on the decision of MoLHSA and in
agreement with the President of Georgia, the Executive Director of the HSPIC was replaced in
the summer of 2004. This change was followed by the replacement of most key managers at the
request of the new Minister. Recruitment of new staff was finalized in January 2005. Staff
changes most certainly were responsible for delays in project implementation, though the efforts
and proactive attitude of the new team helped pick up implementation speed again.
62.     Changes in coordination framework and delayed clarity on division of
responsibilities between partners. The coordination framework was changed several times
during project implementation. MoLHSA, DFID, the World Bank, and the European Union, the
main stakeholders of the PHC reform, signed a memorandum of understanding on January 25,
2003, to promote coordination of their activities in the process of reforming the PHC system in
Georgia. Based on the mutual agreement between the parties and with the legal endorsement of
MoLHSA, the multisectoral PHC Coordination Board, chaired by the Minister of Health and the
PHC Management Committee as an executive arm of the Coordination Board, was established in
November 2003. However, the coordination arrangement was short lived; it ceased operating in
October 2004. Apparently, implementation plan had not been approved by the Ministry. This
resulted in a lack of clarity as to the responsibilities of various partners, especially in terms of
mutual responsibilities, potential areas where duplication of services could occur, and the timing
of activity implementation. These circumstances delayed project implementation by as much as
eight months.
63.    Conflict between Georgia and Russian Federation. Ongoing local and international
procurement procedures during the conflict were suspended. Moreover, the conflict hindered the
commencement of the PHC personnel training in family medicine.
64.     Lengthy and delayed project restructuring. The project restructuring process was
postponed several times. After the midterm review mission in May 2007, when the Ministry of
Finance informed the IDA of the government of Georgia’s decision to utilize all available
resources under the project, a request was made for an extension of the project until June 30,
2010, and a restructuring proposal was provided. The project’s closing date was extended to
December 31, 2009. However, the October 2007 mission could not finalize project restructuring
because the upcoming elections in January 2008 created difficulties in reaching an agreement for
the use of the remaining project funds. After the elections and the subsequent appointment of a
new Minister in February 2008, the government informed the Bank that they would like to
finalize project restructuring after the Parliamentary elections in May 2008. This process was
further postponed by the conflict with the Russian Federation in August 2008.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization
65.     Design, implementation, and utilization of M&E were rated Moderately Satisfactory for
the following reasons:
66.     Design. The PAD included a comprehensive set of PDOs, outcomes, and intermediate
indicators, which well reflected the project’s objectives. Although the number of indicators was
extensive (10 outcome/impact indicators and 14 intermediate outcome indicators), the HSPIC
managed to monitor and report systematically on them, except seven original PDO indicators
that were dropped after restructuring 21 . The HSPIC strongly collaborated with the Medical
Statistics Unit under the National Center for Disease Control and Public Health, which furnished
the HSPIC with all necessary updates on performance indicators, while the HSPIC provided
systematic reports on all measurable indicators on a biannual progress report basis. The same
arrangement continued after restructuring was completed.
67.    Implementation. The HSPIC was responsible for collecting and reporting on project
monitoring indicators. The project’s M&E activities and framework were implemented as
planned and M&E became an integral part of the terms of reference of the project
implementation team (including program managers and component coordinators). All biannual
and annual progress reports on the status of project implementation outlined the output and
outcome status in a satisfactory manner. Information on indicators was issued regularly and
reported through semiannual and annual progress reports and reflected in aide-memoires.
68.    Regular monitoring. Project progress monitoring was a key instrument of project
management and ensured the timely receipt of comprehensive and regularly updated information.
A number of M&E activities were developed. These activities were effective in monitoring
various aspects of the project’s implementation. The M&E system was further supported by a
range of additional surveys (for example NHA, HSPA, Health Utilization and Expenditure
Survey, and patient satisfaction surveys).
69.     Utilization. While there was systematic collection of data by the project team from all
subordinated agencies, it should have been MoLHSA that served the aggregate function for all
collected data, generating reports and using them to recommend follow-up programs. A
disappointing aspect of the M&E system, indeed all these reporting systems, was that the
government did not use them adequately.

2.4    Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance
Environmental Safeguards
70.     The project is shown as being classified as a category C at the time of appraisal, but was
subsequently upgraded to a category B operation at negotiations stage. Although the PAD is
clearly explaining that an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was developed by the
government of Georgia for this project in collaboration with the Ministry of Natural Resources
and Environmental Protection, the ICR team was unsuccessful in its attempt to locate the EMP.
There is no evidence that the draft EMP has been disclosed and discussed with stakeholders in-
country and posted in the Bank's InfoShop. The Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS)
carrying a stamp "Public Disclosure Authorized" and dated May 17, 2002 (the day of issuance of
the Board package) has no dates entered for in-country disclosure of the EMP and for its
submission to the InfoShop, which is considered as a major deficiency. If EMP was actually not
disclosed to the Georgian public and not posted in the InfoShop, this might be due to confusion
about requirements, which was only clarified later in 2002. It was unclear, even in the June 2002
handbook on safeguards policy, when disclosure of documents in the case of Category B projects
was to take place (prior to appraisal or when ready without a specific timeframe). In addition, at
the time, there was some confusion as to whether disclosure applied for IBRD and/or IDA
projects. This lack of clarity was eventually addressed in the January 2003 handbook (the PAD is
dated May 17, 2002).
71.     No record is available on environmental monitoring/supervision that may have taken
place during project implementation. There is no write-up on safeguards compliance even in the
final aide-memoire (AM). The only reference to safeguards was made during the MTR
supervision mission with the AM stating that "the safeguards effectiveness review was held in
the period of April 6-10, 2007". A mail archive of the then TTL who was in charge of the project
during 2007 and who has since left the Bank, is unavailable to the ICR team (system has blocked
access). The ICR team is in contact with the information technology unit to see if this can be
resolved. The ICR team was informed by the project team of the MoHLSA that they never
received the AM from the environmental specialist who visited Georgia in 2007.
72.     However, the ICR team was successful in retrieving evidence confirming that all unified
architectural and construction related contracts have specific clauses about environmental issues.
The HSPIC was diligent in providing the environmental guidelines (Environmental Management
Plan for Georgia PHC Development Project) to all contactors during project implementation.
The project did not have significant or irreversible negative environmental impact at the
construction phase of the facilities. There were no official complaints or other indications of any
problems related to the mentioned issues.
Fiduciary Arrangements
73.    Financial management was rated Satisfactory. The financial management
arrangements at the HSPIC, including accounting, reporting, budgeting and planning, internal
                                           21
controls, fund flows, and staffing, were considered as strong throughout implementation and
were rated consistently as Satisfactory. The level and timeliness of government of Georgia
cofinancing was also Satisfactory. A financial management review was undertaken in January
2002 to determine whether financial management arrangements within the HSPIC were
acceptable to the Bank. An assessment report concluded that they were satisfactory to the Bank,
and the capacity was considered sufficient for recording all transactions and balances, supporting
the preparation of regular and reliable financial statements, and safeguarding project assets.
74.     The HSPIC was equipped with the institutional mandate to implement relevant programs,
and these were staffed with adequate fiduciary personnel as required for carrying out their core
functions. There were two departments under the HPSIC: one for financial management had
three permanent staff members, including a finance manager; and another for procurement was
also staffed adequately with a head of procurement and two coordinators who were in charge of
technical assistance and goods.
75.    Audit reports. The annual audited project financial statements were received on time
and were found unqualified by the auditors. All external audits were prepared and issued in a
timely manner and have consistently been unqualified. The contract with an external auditor was
extended to cover the audit for the FY 2012 financial statement, which will close in early
December 2012. The final audit is being completed and is expected to be issued in December
2012. Disbursements under the project generally proceeded as planned and the funds were
almost totally disbursed. Withdrawal applications were prepared on a regular basis and
supporting documentation was found to be complete.
76.    Internal reporting. The interim financial reports were generally produced on time and
were of satisfactory quality.
77.     Disbursement. Disbursements were generally made as planned, with some delays. An
undisbursed balance of approximately US$ 60,000 was canceled after the end of the grace period
for the reconciliation of accounting.
78.     Procurement was rated Moderately Satisfactory. No significant challenges or delays
were encountered in the procurement procedures. Numerous complex procurements were carried
out and several contracts satisfactorily awarded throughout project implementation. General
compliance with the Bank’s procurement procedures was observed. Procurement management
and implementation was carried out by three procurement specialists in the HSPIC:
(a) procurement manager and civil works procurement specialist; (b) technical assistance and
trainings procurement specialist and consulting services procurement specialist; and (c) goods
procurement specialist, with sufficient capacity and necessary qualifications.
79.     The consulting assignment, with a cost estimate of US$ 400,000 for the development of a
communication strategy on health sector reform for MoLHSA, was cancelled at a very late stage
of the selection process – that is, after opening of the financial proposals when the first-ranked
firm would have been known to the Ministry and the participating consultants. The Ministry’s
                                                 22
action in cancelling the assignment called into question the integrity and transparency of the
selection process. The Bank issued no objection to the cancellation of the process in September
2011 and reallocation of the budget to other activities, which were then considered top priorities
by the Ministry. As a result, the objective of subcomponent 2.1 was not achieved under the
project.
80.     It is worth mentioning that the World Bank mission conducted a fiduciary review for the
health sector development project in Georgia in 2011, and the respective report was prepared on
the basis of the findings and results of a review of a sample of contracts signed between January
2009 and September 2011 for the health project, covering 15 contracts under all categories and
procurement methods, starting from advertisement to launch the procurement process until the
completion of contractual obligations, including payments and physical verification of selected
contracts. Procurement under the project included (a) civil works; (b) equipment, including
medical and office equipment; (c) medical and office furniture; (d) medical supplies; and
(e) consulting services and trainings procured under various types of selection methods
according to the development credit agreement. The fiduciary team observed generally
satisfactory procurement implementation, notably up-to-date procurement planning, timely
implementation of procurement activities, and general compliance with the Bank’s procurement
procedures, though there were several issues requiring improvement in the procurement process
and in contract implementation.
81.   The fiduciary review concluded that the procurement performance for the project was
Moderately Satisfactory.
2.5    Post-completion Operation and Next Phase
82.     Though World Bank support to the health sector is being concluded and financial
assistance provided from other donor agencies is gradually decreasing, new health sector reforms
are being implemented. In order to sustain the results achieved and to ensure successful
implementation of the reforms in 2011, the government of Georgia approved the new National
Health Strategy for 2011–2015, with the theme “Affordable and Quality Health Care.? The
strategy was adopted in November 2011. As stated above, development of the strategy was
funded by this project. The effective implementation of the new national strategy will ensure that
results achieved under the project will be sustained. All items outlined by the strategy were fully
or partially funded by the project.
83.     Continuation of the policy dialogue on health. As part of the analytical work in
Georgia and through the DPO series, the Bank will maintain the policy dialogue with the sector
and prepare the series of policy notes in 2012–2013. As for the previous DPO series for 2009–
2011, the project contributed to achievement of the majority of the health-related triggers. At the
time of writing, the new government of Georgia started to introduce its sectoral programs. The
Bank team aims to play an active role as a potential donor (in case there is an interest in new
projects) as well as a technical partner.
                                                23
84.    Maintenance. Maintenance costs and implications for the recurrent budget of the health
sector have been factored into the PHC financing formula, so that PHC facilities have an
adequate level of resources and autonomy to deliver services.
3.       Assessment of Outcomes

3.1      Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
85.     The relevance of objectives, design, and implementation arrangements are rated High.
Supporting the implementation of the government of Georgia health reform program through
expanding access to quality PHC, increased utilization and improved stewardship of MoLHSA
were fundamental development priorities of both the government of Georgia and the Bank at the
time of project approval and by the time of restructuring. At the time of the ICR mission, both
PDOs (original and revised) were highly relevant because (a) PHC continues to be at the center
of quality service delivery, especially in rural areas; (b) utilization of PHC services remains a big
issue; and (c) further improvements in the stewardship function of MoLHSA are needed.
86.     The project has had a significant impact on the ongoing series of health sector reforms in
the country. In particular, the project has made substantial achievements in (a) implementing
PHC reform with an emphasis on the family medicine model; (b) introducing the entire notion of
the guideline development process; (c) strengthening institutional capacity of both MoLHSA and
other subordinated agencies.
3.2      Achievement of Project Development Objectives
87.     A rating of Moderately Satisfactory and Satisfactory was given to the original PDOs and
the revised PDOs, respectively. The ICR team applied the methodology found in Appendix B of
the ICR guidelines 22 in evaluating the overall achievement of the PDOs.
88.    The main PDO before restructuring was to improve coverage and utilization of quality
PHC based on a model of family medicine and general practice, with an emphasis on reaching
the poor and disadvantaged (table 5).

90.    The key performance indicators were changed at the time of restructuring. The revised
PDO includes a new objective relating to the strengthening of the stewardship functions of
MoLHSA. The revised PDOs are to (a) improve coverage, utilization, and quality of health care
services in the territory of the recipient; and (b) strengthen the government’s stewardship
functions in the health sector. The ICR team concluded that the project was relevant at the time
of design and after the restructuring and remains relevant today. The project has overachieved
and achieved its revised PDO indicators (tables 7 and 8).

3.3      Efficiency
91.     The ICR team reviewed briefly aspects of the macro – economic and sector context
during the project implementation (Annex3: Economic Analysis).
3.4      Justification for Overall Outcome Rating
92.     The project overall outcome is considered Moderately Satisfactory based on its
significant achievements, its continued relevance, and its contribution toward strengthening the
health sector in Georgia and making it more accountable and efficient. As per the ICR
guidelines, the ICR team weighted the overall outcome against both the original and revised key
performance indicators based on amounts disbursed at the time of formal restructuring (table 9).
The project managed to achieve almost all its development objectives despite major challenges
faced during the implementation stage. The most problematic was the utilization of outpatient
services for the poor and the general population. The low utilization rate of services by the
general population is explained by the unwillingness to be insured and other affordability
problems. The government of Georgia’s plan for 2012 to further expand the State-financed
insurance base for children (0–5 age group) and the elderly (60+) aimed at improving access. As
for 2013 the government of Georgia is planning to cover the whole population of Georgia with
universal health insurance through a comprehensive basic package of services. It is believed that
the target set by the project was too ambitious to reach within the given time original frame,
especially considering all the key factors that impacted implementation.

3.5        Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a)        Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
93.    One of the key social issues relevant to the project objectives is the differential access to
health care services among the poor and non-poor in Georgia. Since 1995, several household
surveys have been carried out. They show that although the entire population faces financial
constraints in accessing health care services, the problem is especially acute for the poor. In
addition, people living in rural and high mountain areas of Georgia face additional barriers in
accessing PHC services due to difficult terrain and distances to travel. In this context, the project,
by supporting primary care services throughout the country and especially for the rural and high
mountain areas, played an important role in reducing access barriers for the poor and
disadvantaged. Increased utilization of PHC was expected to reduce morbidity and mortality
among the poor, thereby contributing to overall household welfare.
94.    This project addressed gender through improving access to quality health care services,
especially in rural and high mountain areas. In addition, the indicators related to the child health
and maternal health Millennium Development Goals, 23 such as the utilization of health services
by women, are well on track. More specifically, there have been some improvements in antenatal
services; for example, the proportion of women who had four or more antenatal consultations
and the proportion who had their blood pressure measured increased from 85 percent in 2007 to
91.3 percent in 2010. The majority of beneficiaries (around 85 percent) of the project were
women, including those working as medical personnel, rural doctors, nurses, and managers.

(b)     Institutional Change and Strengthening
95.      It is difficult to attribute success in capacity building to a single project, as other
intervention factors are always in play. However, during ICR discussions, central, regional, and
district stakeholders, including facility managers and medical personnel, recognized that project
investments had resulted in substantial institutional development impacts at the different levels
of the health system. The project strengthened institutions (including MoLHSA, the Social
Service Agency, the National Center for Disease Control and Public Health, PHC facilities, and
ambulatories) and, among other things, supported development of a comprehensive family
medicine system and development of a legal framework for better management of the sector.
This role was acknowledged during ICR discussions. Staff highlighted the direct benefits of the
project in retraining of doctors and nurses, who were better able to work together as teams in the
family medicine setting. In participating hospitals, physicians and nurses acknowledged the
positive role the project played in considerably improving the physical infrastructure and
availability of medical equipment; it has promoted efficiency and brought about gains in
productivity.
96.     Each of the components supported institutional strengthening in their respective areas.
The staff interviewed in several institutions during the ICR process acknowledged the positive
role of the project in strengthening PHC services. Training presented opportunities for PHC staff
to exchange experiences and learn about new techniques to enabling them to increase
productivity and the quality of their work. The opportunity to be exposed to international best
practices was also widely acknowledged as a strong element of the project. In addition, building
evidence-based policy formulation capacity brought about the achievement of the project
outcomes despite the numerous changes faced in health sector reform directions. More
specifically, under subcomponent 1.2, PHC training, the project managed to retrain 916 doctors
and 1,073 nurses. By the end of the project, 404 PHC doctors were trained in management and
550 doctors were trained in new guidelines. The support to health sector reform component
managed to establish the NHA, which was completely institutionalized from 2003. Georgia has
been acknowledged by the World Bank as the only country in the region able to institutionalize
NHA and use it for evidence-based policy development. 24 In addition, the Health Utilization and
Expenditure Survey methodology has been institutionalized by GeoStat and is being
implemented by the Household Survey Department with funding from the State budget. Under
the third component, the project has provided an opportunity to improve overall project
management and coordination through participation in various training courses and on-the-job
training provided by short-term consultants. It is obvious that the technical knowledge and
performance of the HSPIC staff is high. In the view of this evaluation, the HSPIC would be rated

regions.
(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (Positive or Negative)
97.      Close coordination and synergies with activities financed by other donors have resulted in
better outcomes for the health sector. While there were no formal cofinanciers, a large number of
donors and international agencies were involved in the process of project preparation and
implementation. Organizations involved in developing and strengthening various aspects of PHC
included the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), WHO, the United Nations Population
Fund (UNFPA), DFID, the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), Oxfam, USAID,
the European Union, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the government
of Austria, the International Medical Corps, CARE, Save the Children, and the International
Committee of the Red Cross. These organizations have contributed in a number of areas,
including maternal and child health, TB, information systems, and community mobilization.
Among these organizations, DFID was most actively involved during project preparation,
working closely and intensively through its Primary Health Care Development Project, which
built a solid ground for PHC in urban areas.
98.    In addition to DFID, the European Union committed up to 7.4 million euros over a five-
year period to expand PHC services in rural and high mountain areas not covered by the project.
The European Union project was implemented by the HSPIC, thus no overlaps were observed. It
was a good example of synergy and coordination at the implementation level.
99.     With regard to coordination between the main donors, MoLHSA, DFID, the World Bank,
and the European Union, as the main stakeholders of PHC reform, signed a memorandum of
understanding on January 25, 2003, to promote coordination of their activities during the process
of reforming Georgia’s PHC system. During the project lifespan, the Bank tried diligently to
collaborate closely with all international donors and their implementing agencies, particularly
DFID, the European Union, USAID, WHO, UNICEF, and – Defense Threat Reduction Agency
(DTRA), to ensure a consistent approach to health sector reforms and to build on other agencies’
experience and ongoing projects. Various supervision missions were completed jointly. The
HSPIC and the World Bank team managed in collaboration with MoLHSA to take proactive
steps to coordinate activities in different project areas through regular formal and informal
coordination meetings, sharing supervision mission findings and updating one another on new
sector challenges. Examples of MoLHSA coordinated arrangements are summarized in table 10.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
100. The risk that development outcomes (or expected outcomes) will not be maintained was
rated as Low to Moderate. The achievements of the project are encouraging, with solid
institutional development in the fields of PHC, management information system development,
and other areas. Furthermore, the new National Health Strategy for 2011–2015, “Affordable and
Quality Health Care,? can ensure that all results and achievements of the project will be
sustained and developed in the future (see also section 2.5 above).

                                                        32
5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance
(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
101.    Based on the Quality Assurance Group review, Bank performance in ensuring quality at
entry was rated as Moderately Satisfactory, for reasons described below.
102. The Bank understood well the evolving political economy of the country, the rapidly
reforming Georgian institutions, and the country’s education needs. The Bank worked closely
with MoLHSA to identify key sector issues, define a strategy for best addressing those issues,
and design appropriate interventions. The Bank considered lessons learned from other Bank-
supported projects in the south Caucasus region, including the implementation of health projects,
and from the work of other development partners in the country. The planning and design of
activities were particularly carefully carried out and reflected the detailed discussions with the
client at appraisal and good knowledge of the country’s health sector issues, especially the
infrastructure challenges. The Bank also took into consideration other donor operations in the
sector, avoiding any potential overlaps and duplications (for example with the activities of
UNICEF, the United Nations Development Programme, USAID, and DFID).
103. Nevertheless, an important shortcoming of the project design was related to its
complexity, especially with Monitoring & Evaluation, with too many indicators to report on and
some that were impossible to measure.
104. An important shortcoming of Bank performance at entry is the lack of follow up to
ensure public disclosure of the Environmental Management Plan.
(b)    Quality of Supervision
105. Overall, the quality of supervision of this project earned a Moderately Satisfactory rating
by the ICR team, due to the reasons given below.
106. The project was monitored regularly during and between missions. The team developed a
strong relationship with the various agencies and was proactive in anticipating and resolving
issues that were encountered. The skills mix in the team was appropriate, allowing for fiduciary
support to the government, as well as technical expertise advanced by experienced Bank
education staff and consultants.
107. The skills mix of the supervision team was adequate, comprising headquarter-based and
Georgia-based staff, as well as international partners. The major drawback of the supervision
process was that none of the supervision mission addressed safeguards. Missions were effective
in reviewing all aspects of project-specific progress, except for safeguards. Project supervision
promoted strong coordination arrangements among a great number of government and
international partners, with the Bank taking the lead in providing effective and strong leadership
to coordinate project implementation among many actors. The team promoted a culture of
                                               33
regular contacts with counterparts to help resolve issues and address client requests and needs
during and between missions, for which the role of the country-based staff was critical. Missions
were well coordinated with partners to ensure complementarity rather than duplication of efforts.
Aide-memoires were prepared before the end of the mission, and were shared and discussed with
national and international stakeholders. The aide-memoires always identified key
implementation issues and suggested ways to resolve them.
108. The World Bank team, although it changed frequently, was always represented by high-
quality experts in their respective fields able to lead effective advocacy as well as provide on-
the-job training to national counterparts. Most team leaders and members (as well as managers)
were highly committed to the successful outcome of the project. The project, MoLHSA, and the
HSPIC benefited greatly from having the task team leader and the procurement adviser located in
the country, alongside the professional staff. Such an arrangement worked well, with the
professional staff able to engage and interact with the Bank team and benefit from its high level
of responsiveness and commitment. Moreover, it gave an opportunity for the Bank team to
supervise the project implementation not twice per year, as is standard Bank practice, but on an
ongoing basis, taking corrective actions as needed.
109. A great effort was made by Bank teams to work jointly with the government counterparts,
and this was instrumental in making positive adjustments to the project and identifying
alternative methods to improve project implementation on a timely basis.
110. The Bank team collaborated closely with all international donors and their implementing
agencies, particularly with DFID, the European Union, USAID, WHO, UNICEF, and DTRA.
Their working relations ensured a consistent approach to health sector reforms and allowed the
project to build on other agencies’ experience and their ongoing projects. During each
supervision mission, the World Bank team met with international partners for regular status
updates, discussing mechanisms to improve coordination and sharing information about the
project’s achievements and challenges in the context of recent developments in the health sector.
This environment allowed the project and the government to reach consensus with the World
Bank on the cancellation of certain activities, addressing new challenges and discussing ways to
be more efficient in the use of developmental credits.
111. The Bank team demonstrated responsiveness in the timely provision of “no objections?
and informed consent for funding interventions not originally planned, and was quick to respond
to government needs and react flexibly in modifying implementation plans and project design.
During supervision, the Bank demonstrated the needed flexibility to adjust the project to the
changing reality of the country and, together with MoLHSA, established a framework for
progress in achieving development objectives. The restructuring of the project provided a good
example of effective World Bank teamwork. The Bank country unit helped guide the project
through intensive supervision and the management team was very much involved in and
dedicated to the project, particularly given the high-profile nature of the operation and its

                                               34
importance. The Bank management supported several extensions of the loan to give the
opportunity and extra time for the project to work. All Bank task team leaders gave the project
high priority and did their best to resolve problems when faced with various challenges through
the course of the project.
(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
112. Based on the harmonized evaluation criteria for ICR and Operations Evaluation
Department (OED) evaluations, overall Bank performance for the project was rated as
Moderately Satisfactory. A fruitful partnership with the borrower led to smooth technical and
institutional collaboration during the preparation and implementation stages. A positive working
climate was fostered with the client; this contributed to achieving or exceeding the majority of
the project’s objectives. However, the lack of safeguards oversight is important to recognize.
5.2    Borrower Performance
(a)    Government Performance
113. The government’s performance during project preparation and implementation was rated
as Moderately Satisfactory. The government demonstrated ownership and commitment to project
objectives throughout its implementation. More importantly, the government adopted and
endorsed all needed policy instruments for the sector and provided the necessary resources for
their operation.
(b)    Implementing Agency Performance
114. Overall, the HSPIC implementation performance was rated as Satisfactory for the
following reasons.
115. The level of commitment was high, notwithstanding changes in leadership and
management, or events such as the August 2008 armed conflict with the Russian Federation. The
HSPIC showed great resolve in pushing forward implementation of the project and ensuring high
management standards. Many of the reform-related issues would have made little progress but
for the HSPIC’s capacity and enthusiasm, and the project team proved to be innovative and
extremely dedicated throughout the entire implementation process. The only shortcoming noted
relates to an underestimation of risks associated with frequent management and institutional
arrangement changes. This was beyond the control of the HSPIC, and was related rather to the
Ministry’s competence and continuity of management.
116. The HSPIC demonstrated very strong performance in conducting activities related to
construction of health care facilities, including PHC facilities and a hospital in Ambrolauri.
Environmental Checklist was a part of all civil works contracts, according to which contractors
were responsible to follow the Environmental Management Plan. The most important was to
follow Environmental Guidelines at the stage of architectural design development. There have
been no complaints or other indications of any problems regarding safeguards during project
implementation. HSPIC’s technical expertise and experience significantly contributed to the
                                                35
success of the infrastructure investments. Its fiduciary performance was also determined to be
strong, as documented by the quality of the audit reports and as reflected in the smooth and
efficient handling of procurement procedures. The progress reports were also accurate and
prepared in a timely manner.
(c)       Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
117. The overall Borrower performance was rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The Borrower
actively participated in the project, maintained a focus on activities related to reform, and
provided active and productive political commitment toward achieving the PDOs. MoLHSA and
its agencies demonstrated efficient performance in all aspects of project implementation.
Moreover, they gained considerable technical capacity and assured that a critical mass of
technical expertise remained in place to further facilitate health sector performance in Georgia.
118. There were clear indications of the Borrower’s commitment and ownership from the
onset of project implementation:
      •   The project was developed collaboratively with the government of Georgia to support the
          Georgian National Health Policy approved by Parliament in July 1999.
      •   The Strategic Health Plan for Georgia, 2000–2009, identified PHC as a priority. The
          document also identified the World Bank as a partner in this process.
      •   The Strategic Health Plan identified budgetary allocations of US$ 20 million to PHC
          from the State budget over the 10-year period.
      •   MoLHSA identified PHC as a priority for Georgia at a donors’ meeting at WHO
          headquarters in September 1999.
      •   The PHC strategy was approved by MoLHSA in December 2000.
      •   The project implementation plans were prepared by local consultants under direct
          supervision of MoLHSA.
      •   A first draft of the National Health Care Financing Strategy Paper was completed at the
          beginning of the project.
6.        Lessons Learned

119. This section considers both project-specific lessons learned and those of wider general
application.
6.1       Project Design
120. Flexible, responsive project design. In the modernization and reform of any sector,
maintaining flexibility in design is essential in order to allow the borrower and the Bank to
explore new avenues and to adapt to changes in a highly volatile sector context, while the


                                                  36
definition of reforms is ongoing. The flexibility in project design allowed for timely adjustments
in the agreed implementation strategy, as the country’s needs and priorities evolved.
6.2    Institutional Arrangements
121. Project implementation unit as structure of the Ministry. The HSPIC, a subordinated
structure to MoLHSA, was staffed with professional, well-educated experts who had clear
functions and responsibilities assigned for the duration of the project, including the period of
preparation. Clearly defined cooperation mechanisms between the HSPIC and corresponding
MoLHSA structures enabled the HSPIC to play an important role in the relatively smooth and
effective implementation of the project. The governance structure matrix allowed the HSPIC to
minimize implementation bottlenecks due to frequent changes in the management teams at
MoLHSA over the course of the project.
122. Staff continuity at project implementation unit. Continuity of staff is a critical element
of project success or failure. Despite changes introduced in the management of the HSPIC, the
core team of experts responsible for the operations and project components remained mainly
unchanged. Consequently institutional memory was maintained, helping to smooth the new
management’s learning curve in project implementation.
6.3    Implementation
123. Project implementation in a rapidly changing political and sector environment.
Expectations for fast and successful implementation of projects in countries with rapidly
changing political environments should be restrained and some delays be expected. This project
serves as a good example of delayed implementation due to the changing policy environment, as
well as a lengthy restructuring process, which resulted in numerous project extensions.
124. Need for realistic assessment of project progress. Difficulties in project
implementation must be resolved and issues should be proactively addressed, as was
demonstrated by this project. All parties involved remained flexible and were open to
alternatives. Various options were jointly examined, weighing all benefits and risks, before
major decisions were taken by either side. This project provides a good example of realistic
assessment of progress, which guided effective project restructuring and adjustment.
6.4    Project Ownership
125. Importance of strong government commitment, particularly with reform-oriented
projects. Reform is concerned not only with technical and institutional improvements, but relies
heavily on political processes. Leadership and ownership of the reforms pursued by the project
were crucial to its success. The project demonstrated strong commitment by many stakeholders,
including from MoLHSA and the Prime Minister’s Office, in effecting reform. These reforms
were crucial in improving the efficiency of the health service delivery system and subsequently
improving access to basic health services for the population. Georgia was politically committed
to raising the health status of the poorest segment of society through the modernization of the
                                               37
health service delivery system and effecting reforms in its operations for service provision for the
population living in poverty. It was also recognized that reaching this segment of society requires
substantial resources. The government of Georgia made a decision to finance what was necessary
to provide a basic package of health care services to the poorest layers of the Georgian
population.
6.5    Donor Coordination
126. Need for effective coordination between all major partners. Management and
supervision of projects and programs where many partners are involved should be a joint
exercise during the total span of the project. Information sharing of all relevant documents
among partners is critical for sustained success of projects and for ensuring consistency of
messages, coordination of inputs, and maintenance of institutional memory.
127. Optimizing benefits through collaboration with partners. Understanding the roles of
and making agreements with technical agencies and development partners can optimize benefits
of various programs. This project provides a good example of coordination with development
partners and with different structures of the government of Georgia. Thorough analysis of the
coordination efforts deployed in the project clearly demonstrated that the investments funded by
partners have complemented those under the project, thereby reducing duplication of efforts and
investments.
6.6    World Bank Assistance
128. Continuous guidance of and active engagement with counterparts. Providing
continuous guidance to and actively engaging with counterparts in seeking solutions to
challenges as they emerge was critical in the successful implementation of the project. A focus
on identifying problems and seeking solutions as a coherent, collaborative World Bank client
team was essential in achieving results.
129. Provision of technical and timely support for fiduciary tasks. Technical and timely
support for fiduciary tasks provided by the World Bank is highly valued. With limited
experience among stakeholders of the implementation of the World Bank’s procurement
guidelines and financial management requirements, it was important to provide on-the-job
training and to make available training courses and workshops for various stakeholders to build
the capacity of the HSPIC in procurement and financial management tasks.
130. Strong Local Presence. The project greatly benefited by the continuous technical
support provided by the WB team. This was especially apparent with the in country presence of
the TTL and the Procurement Advisor which enabled the HSPIC to react in a timely manner to
the bottlenecks faced during the project.

Annex 3. Economic Analysis

Introduction
An economic analysis was conducted at appraisal stage of the project. The objectives of the
economic analysis included: i) provide a summary of the macro-economic situation and sectoral
context in which the proposed project will be implemented; (ii) provide justification for
government involvement in the proposed project; (iii) discuss the distortions on the demand and
supply side in the current health system which would affect the achievements of the project
objectives; (iv) present a stylized analysis of the costs and benefits from the proposed project;
and (v) consider the fiscal impact of the project, including concerns regarding fiscal
sustainability.
This analysis as part of the implementation completion report reviews briefly the macro-
economic situation during project implementation, reports on the mentioned distortions and how
they played out during implementation. No new analysis was undertaken because it is unlikely
that the long term effects and benefits of health reform can be demonstrated after a relatively
short period of implementation. Instead an assessment of the likelihood of the benefits accruing
based on the intermediate outputs and outcomes of the project are provided.
Macro-economic and sector context during project implementation:
The macro economic situation had been volatile and weak during the decade preceding appraisal.
During the project implementation, Georgia enjoyed strong economic growth between 2001 and
2007, ranging between 4 and 12 % of growth in GDP. It suffered a serious dip in growth due to
the war with Russia in 2008-2009, but quickly regained strong growth again in 2010-2012
providing an overall positive environment to increase health expenditures.
One of the main distortions or critical risks to the development objective made during appraisal
was the low rate of health expenditures. At the time of appraisal only about 3% of total public
budget was spent on health. During the implementation years Georgia’s spending on health
increased considerable; sevenfold between 2002 and 2010. However as a % of the overall public
budget and GDP health spending remained low. So, unlike the prediction during appraisal that it
would be unlikely more resources would become available for health, they did, although in real
terms, the increase remains small.

Allocative inefficiencies were mentioned at appraisal as serious risks. Among other, the use
of outdated protocols and the focus on hospital settings rather that the more efficient use of
primary care were identified as underlying causes to the inefficiencies. The project focus on
primary care, the introduction of family doctors and quality improvement, i.e. update
diagnostic and treatment protocols did results in increased levels of utilization of primary
care (TB treatment as out-patient primary care level, using the DOTS strategy, increased
from 3 percent to 52 percent).
Technical inefficiencies identified at appraisal, such as lack of incentives or performance
based budgeting and monitoring, weak contracting mechanisms have been addressed
during implementation. Regarding the purchasing model, the Medical Insurance Program
(MIP) was introduced and managed through contracts with private health insurers,
effectively delinking the purchaser-provider link and increasing efficiency. The MIP offers a
comprehensive package of health benefits to poor households meeting the proxy-means
test criteria. The MIP improved Georgia’s health spending targeting to the poor and also
made the system more efficient. The MIP has a major impact in reducing out-of-pocket
spending among beneficiaries. However, much more remains to be done as out of pocket
spending still represents 70% of total health spending.
The health management information system, SIMS, which the project helped develop, pilot and
roll out contributes to improved efficiency as well. Finally, the focus during implementation on
bringing down pharmaceutical prices is starting to show results with steady, albeit slow,
reduction in drug prices.
Cost and benefits
The main costs of the project comprised the primary care service component which was the
focus of the stylized economic analysis at appraisal. The analysis did not quantity the costs and


                                                              46
benefits supporting the institutional development component. However, as discussed above, in
hindsight it is likely to have contributed to improved efficiency and equity.
The project main investment costs, those for the primary care level improvements, were expected
to provide the following benefits: identification and treatment of a range of diseases at the
primary care level resulting in reduction of hospital admissions and bed-days due to improved
primary care. The project implemented a master plan to rationalize health infrastructure,
reducing the number of beds and increasing out-patient primary care access. Project monitoring
data shows 50% of the population has access to family doctors and 78% of the targeted
population is covered. Utilization of those now covered with improved primary care services
increased from 2 visits per capita to 2.6 visits per capita. European average are about 3-4 visits
per capita. Equity improved as a result of targeting with 2.6 visits per capita for the poor as
opposed to 2.3 visits per capita for the richer quintiles.
Tuberculosis (TB) in specific is worth mentioning as it shows clearly the results from the project
and the likelihood of the benefits occurring. TB is a chronic disease which is highly prevalent in
Georgia. Pre-project the treatment protocol was to hospitalize patients up to 6-8 months while
the international protocol, now adopted in Georgia is a maximum of 2 months hospitalization
and DOTS treatment at the primary care level. This saves considerable bed days and hospital
costs. Treatment of TB went from 3% at primary care level in 2009 to 52% in 2011 in the
targeted areas.
The appraisal economic analysis includes indirect benefits in the calculation such as savings on
transport and productivity for the households and health benefits which are long term and not
expected until about 20 years after health reforms.
Conclusion:
Despite restructuring and changes in indicators, the main focus of the project on which the
economic analysis was based did not change and remained valid throughout the project. The
focus remained on primary care, increasing public spending, and improved quality. The results of
the project support the mitigation of several of the distortions, or critical risks, towards achieving
the project objectives as explained above. Further, the results also support the likelihood that the
estimated benefits at appraisal will accrue in the future.

Overview of Country’s Economic and Health Sector Context
ECONOMIC CONTEXT
Prior to independence, Georgia enjoyed one of the highest standards of living. However,
separation from the Soviet economic system, combined with the rapid introduction of a market
economy and civil war, left the country in a state of economic collapse which severely reduced
resources for the health sector 28. From 1990 to 1994 GDP fell by 68% and in 1993 inflation was
over 1500% 29. Though, after 1994, the economic situation improved rapidly, with an average
growth rate of 8% per year, and stable inflation. The Georgian economy has not been protected
to external shocks such as the 1998 ruble crash or the contentious Russian ban on key Georgian
exports, but in 2006, GDP growth was 9.5% and reached 12.3% in 2007 30 . Nevertheless,
economic growth has not benefited all sectors of the population equally. Poverty has been a
pervasive problem for Georgia. Therefore the government started to implement the Economic
Development and Poverty Reduction Programme (EDPRP), approved in April 2003 developed in
collaboration with the World Bank. Following the Rose Revolution in 2003, the new government
introduced radical economic reforms focused on deregulation, privatization, the fight against
corruption and transformation of social sectors, including health and education 31.

HEALTH SECTOR
The health system inherited from the Soviet Union consisted of a large number of health
facilities, especially hospitals and health personnel, particularly specialists. Under the Soviet
health care system, majority of population by-passed the primary health care and was seeking the
services at hospitals. Health care was by and large free. However, right after Independence,
Georgia faced a severe economic crisis which was further complicated by internal political
problems.

Between 1991- 1994, health expenditures as a percent of total public expenditures declined from
13.2% in 1991 to 0.54% in 1994. In real terms, the Government was spending less than a dollar
per capita in 1994 (US$0.81) compared with 1991 when it was spending US$10.00 per capita.
This sharp decline in public expenditures in a health system which was primarily funded through

public purse led to the collapse of the health system. Out-of-pocket payments (OOP) for serves
received became widely spread and resulted in economical access barrier for the most of the
population. Moreover, decreased sector funding gradually had a negative implication on the
status of the health service delivery system. Consequently the sector was getting mounting
number of dilapidated infrastructure, shortage of basic equipment and medical furniture as well
as lack of essential medicines for quality service provision. Existing situation also affected
geographical distribution of medical personnel and deteriorating professionalism of the health
work-force.

In response to the crisis in the health sector, the Government of Georgia (GOG) introduced
extensive health sector reforms. These reforms sought to improve the mobilization, allocation
and management of public funds for the health sector.

Health Care Financing: In 1995, three purchasing agents were created: the State Medical
Insurance Company (SMIC), Municipal Health Funds (MHF) and the Public Health Department
(PHD). Resources from general budget were directed towards SMIC and the PHD, whilst
payroll taxes were exclusively used to fund SMIC. Municipal financing flows were accumulated
and processed through the MHF. Each purchasing agent was responsible for financing different
elements of the Basic Benefits Package (BBP). The BBP was developed as a part of the 1995
health sector reforms and sought to utilize limited public funds for the most cost-effective
services. There were approximately 39 items in the BBP, and each purchaser was mandated to
provide specific aspects. The three public purchasers contracted specialized hospitals, polyclinics
and rural ambulatories to deliver the services financed by each purchaser.

In 2000, Georgia spent approximately 220.3 million GEL on health care of which approximately
73% was estimated to be private Out of Pocket (OOP) and 27% public expenditure. This
amounted to 3.9% of GDP, equivalent to 41 GEL or US$20 per person. 53% of OOP was spent
on medicines and the remainder on medical consultations. Out of all types of medical services,
inpatient treatment incurred highest costs. The main sources of public sector funds for health
care were: a) general budget financing; b) payroll taxes; and c) allocations from municipalities
(local governments). Private health insurance in Georgia was not significant, and amounted to
less than 0.5 million GEL per year. The government has determined co-payments for a range of
health services not included in the BBP. Co-payments were supposed to retain by the facilities
and used to fund recurrent costs. However, FFS payments (called “internal standards? in
Georgia), were applicable for all health services which were not covered under the BBP and
were covered in full by patients.

Health Service Provision - Under the health sector reforms of 1995, the role of the Ministry of
Labor, Health and Social Affairs (MOLHSA) has shifted from the direct delivery of health
services to policy-making, regulation and execution of public health functions. The MoLHSA
was represented at the regional level through Regional Public Health Departments being
independent but yet coordinating functions with the MoLHSA. The health sector reforms sought
to convert all health facilities into quasi-private entities 32 under state ownership. Pharmacies in

     Limited liability and Joint stock companies

Georgia operated as entirely private entities. However, hospitals, polyclinics and rural
ambulatories were not granted full autonomy. Moreover, the sector was characterized by surplus
and inherited soviet structure of specialty hospitals and policlinics. There were ongoing efforts in
Georgia to restructure and downsize these facilities for efficiency and effectiveness.

The major transformation of the health sector started since the Rose Revolution in 2003. The
new government was faced with addressing the problems resulting from the weak
implementation of previous reforms, but especially the growth in out-of-pocket payments, the
excessive and obsolete health infrastructure, and inequity in access to health services. Initially,
the new government refrained from making changes in the health sector. A lot of international
technical assistance had been provided to the MoLHSA to work out separate segments of the
health care reform programme, including the transformation of PHC, health financing,
pharmaceutical policy, and the hospital sector, but almost no significant decisions were endorsed
to modify the system in the years 2003–2005. The only exception was the cancellation of social
health insurance which was very much related to the overall government policy of reducing
taxation for the sake of economic growth, rather than it being a decision of the MOLHSA to
improve efficiency.

In 2004 –2006 a major emphasis was placed on the transformation of the social sector, and
introduction of the targeted social assistance programme. The proxy-means testing methodology
was introduced, defining a single group of beneficiaries by socioeconomic status. A database of
the poorest households was created identifying those in most economic need for receiving cash
social benefits. Previous forms of social assistance to different target groups were substituted by
this programme, and it was extended to the health sector.

The first Health Priorities “Main Directions in Health 2007–2009? was elaborated in 2006 by the
MOLHSA together with the state minister’s office. According to document four major objectives
of the health sector transformation were outlined: a) to ensure the overall affordability of basic
health services and protect the general population from catastrophic financial health risks; b) to
ensure the quality of medical services by creating and enforcing the necessary regulatory
environment; c) to ensure the accessibility of quality medical service by the continuing
development of medical infrastructure and competent human resources; and d) to increase health
system efficiency by capacity-building of the MoLHSA and its subordinate institutions, and the
introduction of sound managerial principles. The main principles were to transition towards
complete marketization of the health sector: private provision, private purchasing, liberal
regulation and minimum supervision. The government started strategy implementation
immediately, starting with the definition and organization of services and infrastructure
development initiatives, including the 100 New Hospitals programme.

Brief Project Description and PDOs
In support of the GOG’s efforts to reform the health sector, the Primary Health Care
Development Project was designed which aimed to address the following weaknesses in the
Georgian health sector: i) lack of access to quality basic health services, ii) inefficient,
fragmented and specialized health care delivery system, iii) distortions in health care financing,
and iv) lack of an appropriate policy and regulatory framework for PHC. The project was

                                                55
approved by IDA on November 8, 2002 in an amount of SDR 16,100,000 and became effective
on May 6, 2003. The main project development objective was to improve coverage and
utilization of quality primary health care (PHC) based on a model of family medicine/general
practice, with an emphasis on reaching the poor and disadvantaged.
The project was initially thought to be implemented within five years with the original closing
date of December 31, 2007. However, due to the number of problems faced the implementation
the project has been extended several times 33.
The Rose Revolution in November 2003, resulted in new Government and consequently the
leadership change at MOLHSA followed by the structural reorganization of the ministry which
affected timely decision making process as well pace of project implementation. Furthermore,
the appointment of the new Director and replacement of almost all key managers at the Georgia
Health and Social Projects Implementation Center (GHSPIC) in 2004 created delays in project
implementation, though the efforts and a proactive attitude of the new team picked up the
implementation speed quickly. Frequent changes of the donor coordination framework and
abolishment of the PHC Coordination Board and PHC Management Committee in 2005, was
another impediment which resulted in ambiguity on the division of roles and responsibilities
between donors and left the project solely responsible for ensuring coordination of project
related interventions between multiple donors supporting the National PHC reform. The
situation was further complicated by the Russian Georgian Conflict as all ongoing local and
international procurement activities during the conflict were suspended. Moreover, the conflict
hindered commencement of the primary health care personnel training in family medicine.
In spite of all challenges faced during the implementation by 2009, the project managed to
achieve almost all its development objectives. The project ensured that majority of rural
population has improved access to a PHC clinic within 30 minutes, one third of them are served
by retrained family medicine providers and 80% of rural population from project targeted areas
is satisfied with the reformed PHC services and absolute majority is aware of the sector reforms.
In addition the project also improved the quality of PHC services: about 60% of PHC physicians
managed cases according to the nationally approved new treatment guidelines compare, 52% of
TB patients were managed at the PHC level according to the DOT strategy compared to 3% in
2004. The project was also instrumental in improving public health expenditure earmarked to
program for poor from 3.6% in 2006 to 35% in 2009 as well as enhancement of the regulatory
function by introduction and or revision of laws. Utilization rate of out-patient health care
services (consultations) differ not only between regions, but also between poor and general
population as well as rural vs. urban. According to the HUES -2010 the total consultations in
WB pilot regions as well as among MIP beneficiaries exceeded the baseline (set in 2006) of
2pc/y and reached 2.10pc/y and 2.5pc/y, respectively and almost reached the set target of 2.3pc/y
general population and 2.6pc/y for poor. There is total increase of hospital outpatient
consultations across all groups (rural, WB pilot, EU pilot, MIP beneficiaries and non-
beneficiaries), apart from urban areas. The slight decrease in village ambulatory consultation rate

- December 31, 2011; Fourth extension - June 30, 2012.

                                                       56
with the exception of WB pilot region is also observed. The invariable increase of consultation
rate is striking in WB targeted regions. From 2007 to 2010 total consultation rate, total outpatient
consultation rate, hospital outpatient consultation as well as consultation at village ambulatories
increased from 1.66 to 2.10; from 1.45 to 1.82; from 0.56 to 0.64 and from 0.29 to 0.36,
respectively.
Starting from the end of 2007 the situation was further complicated by the radical changes in the
direction of the health sector reforms introduced by the new Government. The government
kicked off full scale privatization of health service provision system which consequently resulted
in changes of the originally planned project interventions. In addition, the Government changed
its approach to the funding of the health sector by further expending of the public private
partnership experience based on the Medical Insurance Program for poor being introduced in
2007.
In order to accommodate the recent changes in the policy directions of the sector, on request of
the GOG the project was restructured in March 2009 and became effective on 22 July 2009. The
restructured project ensured that activities which were under implementation and remained
relevant to the changed policy environment were continued as well as it emphases and supports
activities which will ensure sustainability of already achieved results. Moreover, the project
aimed at strengthening of the Government’s stewardship function through capacity building by
supporting the development of the modernized health management information systems.
Therefore, the revised PDO included a new objective relating to the strengthening of the
stewardship functions of the MOLHSA. The revised PDOs were to: (i) improve coverage,
utilization and quality of health care services in the territory of the recipient, and (ii) strengthen
the Government’s stewardship functions in the health sector.
Change of the PDOs resulted in modification of the project title as well from “PHC Development
Project? to “Health System Development Project?.
Similar to the original project, the restructured project mostly met all stated development
objectives. By end of 2011, the project ensured that 78% of rural population has improved access
to a PHC clinic within 30 minutes, 50% of them are served by retrained family medicine
providers and 77% of rural population from project targeted areas is satisfied with the reformed
PHC services and absolute majority (93%) is aware of the sector reforms.
Apart from changing the title of the project and the PDOs, the structure of the project has also
been revised. The original project structure as well as after restructuring is summarized in the
Table 1 below.

Project Analysis and Achievement of Project Outcomes
COMPONENT 1: PHC SERVICE DELIVERY
The project planned to finance PHC sector capital improvements, heavily invest in the building
the national education system for PHC human resource development as well as contribute to the
improvement of the service quality through ensuring functional linkages between different levels
of the health service providers. As a result the following outcomes have been achieved.
In order to efficiently use available financial resources for PHC capital improvements the
following outcomes have been achieved by the project:
PHC FACILITY MASTER PLAN -The project has made substantial contribution to the
introduction of the effective model of PHC network through the development of the
comprehensive, technically sound and feasible National PHC Master Plan (NMP). At the end of
the exercise the country received the NMP that was helpful in allocating available resources and
providing an understanding of the gaps. The national master planning process started from
Imereti region and was further rolled out throughout the country (except Kakheti region which
was covered by EU project). The PHC NMP was approved by MoLHSA and used further for
investment purposes as well as for the policy decisions elaborated beyond 2007.
REHABILITATION & E QUIPMENT OF RURAL PHC FACILITIES- The PHC facilities targeted by
the project were selected based on the National PHC master plan. By end of 2007, the project
managed to rehabilitate and equip 103 PHC facilities in Imereti, Adjara and Shida Kartli regions.
The rehabilitation and equipment of remaining PHC clinics were cancelled due to the GOG’s
new approach towards privatization of the entire health service provision sector including the
PHC. In March, 2008 the GOG approved governmental program “Support to Rural Doctors’
Private Practice Development? which entailed provision of a lump sum benefit for rehabilitation
of PHC premises, basic set of medical equipment and training in family medicine. In total there
were 898 locations of rural PHC clinics considered for support based on the PHC NMP, out of
which 158 had been rehabilitated and equipped by various programs including the PHCDP. All
together the project purchased and distributed 94 sets of equipment to the PHC service providers
in Imereti, Guria, Adjara, Shida Kartli and Racha-Lechkumi regions, the residual number of
equipment was provided by the GoG under respective state program. “
                                                58
Starting from 2008, the private PHC providers are contracted by the private insurance industry in
order to ensure continuity of care as well as effective insurance case management.
Project was also instrumental in supporting the improved quality of the PHC services through
establishment of functional linkages of the PHC with other health services. Namely the project
aimed at establishment of PHC linkages with: a) the laboratory service providers by design and
improvement of referral laboratory system, b) on the model of the MCH services support MCH
referral system by investing in the Kutaisi Perinatal Center, c) after restructuring by investing in
the Ambrolauri Hospital and finally d) by supporting the development of the national treatment
guidelines and training of PHC workforce.
AMBROLAURI HEALTH CENTER - This Activity was not considered in the original project
design. However the consequences of hospital privatization reform in 2008, clearly showed low
interest of private investors in the facilities located in high mountainous districts of the country.
To resolve the problem, the GoG decided to fund remodeling of those hospitals from the state
budget. To implement its decision the GoG mobilized donor funding to support rehabilitation of
four hospitals in Ambrolauri, and Samtskhe-Javakheti regions. USAID took responsibility for
three hospitals, apart from Ambrolauri district hospital construction of which was financed
through project proceeds. As a result, 25-bed general hospital has been constructed by the project.
Later in 2011, within the frame of the new hospital sector reform project, the hospital has been
handed over to the private insurance company “IC Group?, the Hospital was equipped by the “IC
Group? . The hospital is fully staffed and operational and provides outpatient and inpatient
serves to the entire population residing in Ambrolauri district. Investments in this hospital
resulted in consolidation of all district level in-patient and outpatient services in one modern
hospital and closure of the old health facilities and rationalization of health personnel. It is
expected that private ownership will (i) ensure effective facility management, (ii) improve
quality of services, (iii) support health workforce skill’s development, (iv) improve access to
required health service for the district population and (v) guarantee financial viability of the
hospital.
REHABILITATION & EQUIPMENT OF REGIONAL REFERRAL LABORATORIES - In order to use
the PHCDP proceeds effectively the project financed development of the laboratory master plan.
The implementation of the master plan started from Adjara region, where the Kobuleti District
Laboratory was refurbished. However the further implementation of the plan was obstructed by
two main reasons: a) the GOG’s new health facility privatization reform being approved in early
2007; and b) the DTRA project on Biological Threat Reduction Program (BTRP) which planned
to reorganize the Public health Laboratory system in order to ensure sustainability of the BTR
established capacities. In order to ensure the financial viability of public health laboratory system
on the one hand and on the other to minimize private investments on building lab capacity in the
new hospitals, it has been decided to expand operations of the Public Health Lab system from
surveillance to clinical, biological and serological lab tests and allow to serve as a referral
laboratory for the new hospitals. The latter system is currently under implementation and
planned to become fully operational by end of 2012. At the ICR the system is partially
operational in Imereti region.
KUTAISI REFERRAL PILOT (KPC)-To support the introduction of the functional linkages of
the PHC with other health services, on the model of maternal and child health services the
project aimed at development of KPC. Utilizing the credit proceeds the project has completed
                                                 59
partial rehabilitation and equipment of the KPC. Another activity planned by the project was to
train the KPC staff and PHC teams involved in the referral system, in the latest international
protocols in the Integrated Management of Pregnancy and Childbirth however, the process has
been put on hold as the hospital has been privatized as part of the GOG’s hospital privatization
reform plan and the Government took decision to hand over to the USAID Implementing Partner
“John Snow International?. The latter trained the OB/GYNs, neonatologists and midwives
from KPC in Effective Perinatal Care (EPC) Principles.
QUALITY OF PHC SERVICE- Another intervention to insure improved service quality was the
provision of administrative and financial support to MOLHSA for the development of clinical
practice guidelines and creation of strong regulatory bases. As a result, 20 new guidelines were
developed, distributed and health personnel from the project targeted areas trained accordingly.
Moreover, Memorandum of Understanding between MOLHSA and UK’s National Institute for
Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has been signed with the purpose to share experience and
expertise of guideline development/creation. Consequently the manual for the guideline
preparation and a model of the “Stroke? guideline has been developed. The given manual has
been acknowledged as a standard methodology for the guideline developed and will be fully
utilized in future work. The new hospital operators of the private health insurance industry
expressed their willingness to participate and finance development and/or adaptation of selected
clinical guidelines and treatment protocols according to the NICE methodology. Accordingly the
MOLHSA is in charge to coordinate the work on the revision of old and the development of new
guidelines and ensure that they meet required national standards. In order to enforce the
implementation of guidelines it has been agreed that: i) MOLHSA will demand the compliance
with the new guidelines as a contractual obligation to the providers contracted for state program
implementation; ii) The regulator will use the guidelines for the auditing the service quality; iii)
Insurance industry will demand the compliance with the new guidelines as a contractual
obligation for the providers. The Physicians Association will ensure: i) development of the new
guidelines; ii) revision of the old ones; iii) training of health providers and iv) provision of
supportive supervision to the providers for ensuring the effective implementation.
Development of the PHC Human capacity was another direction supported by the project. In
order to ensure the sustainability of the given intervention, the project aimed at building national
institutional and human capacity. For this purpose the following outcomes have been achieved:
FAMILY MEDICINE FACULTY (FMF) AND REGIONAL FAMILY MEDICINE TRAINING
CENTERS (RFMTC) - Major inputs of the component were focused on the development of
human resources and creating training capacity. The PHCDP has made an input in extending
existing capacity and development of the critical mass of trained Family doctors by supporting
establishment of Family Medicine Faculty at the State Medical University and Regional Family
Medicine training Centers (RFMTCs) in Imereti and Adjara.
The FMF was initially established in the Medical Academy and later after the merger of the
Medical Academy with the State Medical University in 2008; the FMF faculty capacity and
functions have been further extended. Faculty staff has been training in teaching family medicine
discipline. The project also supported development of the training curricula for undergraduate
students as well as revision of the residency program. The faculty is currently involved in
provision of training for i) undergraduates; ii) residents in Family Medicine; iii) TOT sessions;


                                                60
and iv) clinical skill training for family physicians. It is also involved the development and
implementation of modern clinical guidelines and treatment protocols.
The project contributed to the development of five RFMTCs for Western Georgia (Kutaisi (1)
and Batumi (3) and Shida Kartli (1)). Buildings of RFMTCs have been refurbished; the centers
have been provided with all the essential office, training and medical equipment as well as
necessary training materials. The TOT training courses for the staff of the RMTCs were
delivered and the first training courses for PHC personnel started in October, 2006. All five
RFMTCs obtained nation accreditation and continue providing training service. They provide
trainings for fee which ensures their sustainability and financial viability. Apart from trainings,
some project trained FM trainers are recruited by the outpatient clinics of the private insurance
industry to ensure introduction of the effective gate keeping function for their insured.
RE-TRAINING OF PHC PERSONNEL - the project managed to re-train In total 916 doctors out of
1068 and 1073 nurses out of 1068. Planned target has been fulfilled by 86% (916/1068) for
doctors and 100% for nurses. Last round of trainings were completed in December 2011.More
than 80% of retrained doctors passed the state certification exams and obtained state certificate in
FM (note: except last round graduates).
TRAINING OF HEALTH MANAGERS - In order to quickly create a critical mass of trained health
managers, the project originally planned to support the health management trainings, however
due to the availability of other donor and public resources the project funds were not utilized as
planned. The DFID/OPM has developed health management training curricula and initiated
training of the health managers for different levels of the system. To quickly build the system
management capacity, additional resources were allocated from the 2007 state budget in support
of short certification courses in Health management. Consequently, 144 health care personnel
have finalized trainings (started in October 2008 and finished in February 2009) in: (i) health
care systems (ii) hospital management, and (iii) primary health care management. Certificates
were issued and handed to graduates.
REFORM OF THE NURSING EDUCATION SYSTEM - The country faces an acute shortage of
nurses, both in urban and rural areas. About 100 nurses graduate every year from nursing schools
which is more than ten times less than observed in Europe, while Georgia needs approximately
1,400 nurse graduates annually to be on par with an average European country. Moreover, the
quality of education is not adequate. In order to address this problem, in 2008 the project
initiated development of the recommendation for nursing education reform and new training
curriculum.      The final report “Development of Policy Recommendations to Support
Modernization of Nursing Education in Georgia? has been reviewed and accepted by the
MoLHSA in January 2010. As a result, the nursing education has been upgraded to the
Bachelor’s degree. The new nursing curriculum was introduced in five Medical Education
Institutions in Tbilisi (3) and Adjara (2). With EU supported project the TOT courses were held
for physician and nurse trainers from these in institutes. All these education facilities received
national accreditation for running Nursing Education and the first cohort of students was
admitted in 2011.
TRAINING OF RURAL DOCTORS ON CONTRACT NEGOTIATION AND MANAGEMENT SKILLS –
The privatization of the PHC facilities put the PHC Physicians against the new realities - to
manage the facility, cost services as well as negotiate the contracts with financiers. These new
realities required new set of skills and knowledge which was absent at this time. In order to build
                                                61
required capacity, the GoG mobilized resources from USAID Co-Reform. To support the rural
PHC doctors CoReform developed the training course “Starting, managing and growing a private
medical practice?. In total more than 1000 rural doctors have been trained out of which 40%
were trained by the project. This intervention helped the rural PHC doctors to negotiate and sign
the contracts with public financier as well as private insurance industry.
COMPONENT 2: Support to Health Sector Reform

This component aimed at supporting interventions directed at: a) the health education and
healthy lifestyle as well as effective communication of the reforms to the general population; b)
building MOLHSA policy development capacity and c) strengthening of the health management
information systems.

The project managed to achieve the following outcomes in building the health education capacity
and improved communication of reforms to the population:

HEALTH EDUCATION AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE-The project originally planned to support
interventions directed towards the health education of the population and promotion of the
healthy lifestyle. Activities in these directions have been cancelled by the MOLHSA and handed
over to DFID/OPM. The latter developed the health promotion strategy being discussed by the
ministry and the Health Promotion Division (HPD) at NCDC. The development of the strategy
implementation plan as well as implementation was passed to HDP using approved annual state
budget. By time of restructuring the MOLHSA considered a need for revising the Health
Promotion strategy and mobilized EU financial and technical support. The EU PHCSP financed
revision of the strategy as well as financed implementation of certain activities jointly with the
NCDC.

COMMUNICATION STRATEGY- The project supported development of IEC Strategy paper
which was approved by MOLSHA but the implementation has been suspended by the latter due
to the foreseen reforms in the sector. The implementation of respective IEC activities were
planned to be implemented during the period of May – December, 2007 though, the political
events of November, 2007 limited the project to implement all activities. It is worthwhile noting
that the project managed to finance the public opinion survey on efficiency of the Vouchers’
scheme under the State Medical Assistance Program for Poor (MAPP) in Imereti and Tbilisi
regions. By the time of restructuring the directions of the health sector reform has changed, thus
the MOLHSA faced a challenge to correctly communicate main reform ideas to all stakeholders
as well as population. Based on the mutual agreement with the WB, the decision was made to
develop new communication strategy. The procurement process for the given assignment was
initiated in February, 2011 which apparently took quite long time and the MOLHSA cancelled
the procurement process as there was very little time left before project closure.



                                               62
Project was quite successful in building the MOLHSA’s policy development capacity by:

ESTABLISHMENT OF H EALTH POLICY UNIT (HPU)-With the support of the project the HPU
started its functioning from 2005 at National Institute of Health and Social Affairs (NIHSA).
Initially HPU was planned to focus on issues such as improvements in the mobilization,
management and allocation of public/private finances for health as well as be responsible for the
development of National Health Accounts (NHA). Under the coordination of the HPU, concept
document for Health Sector Reform, “Document Review and Health Policy Analyses?, “Health
Policy Alternatives? and various other technical papers have been made available. HPU has
made important contribution towards institutionalizing NHA. In 2007 the HPU was incorporated
within MOLHSA’s structure. Two of the three specialists of HPU have been promoted to the
positions of the Heads of Sector Policy and Health and Emergency Situation Control
Departments. The Health Policy and Program Department at MoLHSA has inherited main
functions of HPU such as the development of sector policies and strategies, their further
implementation, production of health reports, development and publication of NHA, health
performance assessment etc.
PHC FINANCIAL MODEL - The project originally planned to develop financing models for
reformed PHC system, however for this activity MOLHSA choose to use non credit proceeds
and mostly relied on the technical assistance available from EU and USAID projects. As a result,
the PHC financing model was developed and approved by the ministry and subsequently
financed through the state budget. A separate line item was included in the state budget to
finance reformed PHC facilities based on the new funding model, while those PHC facilities that
still needed to be targeted continued to receive funding as in past. Since 2008, after introduction
of the MAPP, apart from state funding the PHC providers were also contracted by private
insurance industry and reimbursed on a capitation basis for the provision of the outpatient
services to the insured.
NATIONAL HEALTH ACCOUNTS (NHA)- The NHA Institutionalization process commenced in
2003 – 2004, when the first steps of NHA familiarization process started at the MOLHSA and in
2006 NHA has been institutionalized by the Governmental decree. Since NHA establishment the
NHA estimates have been developed for the years 2001-2009; 2001-2006 TB NHA and 2007
UNGASS report regarding HIV/AIDS spending in the country according NASA classification of
HIV/AIDS. The NHA is widely used in developing health care strategy particularly: i) to
examine health financing policy issues; ii) allocate government health care funding to priority
services and population; iii) compute policy related indicators such as: per capita health spending,
health expenditures as percentage of the GDP and different indicators; iv) plan health care
budget (medium term expenditure framework 2006-2010, program budgeting process uses NHA
results as a bases for evaluation and monitoring of annual outcomes; technical documents of
state health programs use NHA results to describe existing situation and pricing the services); v)
prepare report on distribution of health payments and catastrophic expenditures; vi) by investors
to plan hospital expenditures and revenues in hospital privatization process; vii) to develop
HIV/AIDS, TB, and Reproductive Health strategy. The Georgia has been acknowledged to be




                                                63
the only country in the region been able to institutionalize NHA and use for evidence based
policy development by the WB 34.
IMPACT EVALUATION OF THE MEDICAL INSURANCE PROGRAM (MIP) - The MIP has been
first initiated as a pilot in Tbilisi and Imereti regions in 2007 and further expanded on a national
scale in 2008. Thus the project financed the first round of the MIP Impact Evaluation in 2009.
The evaluation revealed improved access and utilization of services by poor, decrease in OOP
for health services but no change in pharmaceutical expenditure. Based on these findings the
Government revised the insurance package by adding pharmaceutical benefit introduced in 2010.
HEALTH SYSTEM PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT (HSPA) - The project supported the
development of the HSPA in close collaboration with WHO experts and HSPA Working Groups
at MOLHSA. The Georgia was one of the pilot countries for HSPA and Georgian HSPA report,
being the first among all pilot countries was published and presented at WHO regional office in
Copenhagen as well as to the wide stakeholders in 2009.
PHARMACEUTICAL POLICY PAPER - In line of supporting evidence based policy development
the HPU with financial support from the project developed pharmaceutical policy paper in 2005.
Based on the National Pharmaceutical Policy recommendations, the Essential Drug List (EDL)
based on the WHO concept of a model list of medicines have been approved. The EDL has been
used by the government for the design of the MIP pharmaceutical benefit in 2010.
In 2009 the GoG managed to amend the Pharmaceutical legislation that allows parallel import of
medicines and proved to serve for increased market competition and eventual decrease of
pharmaceutical prices. In response to the new legislation access to the medicines has improved,
prices on original brand medicines decreased; mark-up on brand medicines has substantially
lowered 35.
HEALTH UTILIZATION AND E XPENDITURE SURVEY (HUES)-The project originally planned to
finance two rounds of HUES, one to serve as a baseline and another within two years period as
follow-up. The overall survey design was based on the Household Budget Survey (HBS) with
certain modifications for which the technical assistance was mobilized by the project. In 2007
the MOLHSA has financed HUES 2007 as well as conference dedicated to the public disclosure
of the HUES report was organized in 2008. In 2010, the project supported the field work as well
as its analysis for the year 2010. In addition, comparative analysis of HUES 2007-2010 has been
prepared and the final report was shared with wide stakeholder groups. Based on HUES 2007
and 2010 the NHA Reports were produced.
SUPPORT TO THE MOLHSA’S MEDIATION S ERVICES AGENCY - The Impact Evaluation of
the MIP program revealed the inadequate utilization of health services by poor and raised
concerns on establishment of the insurance mediation service which should help the insured to
resolve the disputes with the insurance companies. This initiative was supported by the USAID

in 2009 and the Insurance Mediation Service has been established as an independent legal entity.
Later in 2010, the GOG took a decision to integrate this function into the MOLHSA and as a
result in June, 2010 the Health Insurance Mediation Service Agency (HIMSA) has been
established 36 under the ministry. On the request of MOLHSA 37 the project provided assistance
to the newly established entity in order to strengthen its operational capacity. Specifically, the
project provided information technology equipment for which certain changes have been
approved in the procurement procedure. The HIMSA is fully operational and serves as a
mediator between insured and insurers (according to the GoG decision from 1, March 2012 the
Mediation Service Agency is merged with MSRA with extended functions).
HEALTH SECTOR DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY WHITE PAPER - Within the frames of the
project the new National Health Sector Strategy 2011-2015 has been developed by the
government and presented to the stakeholders in November, 2011. This is a first national
strategy developed for the last decade. The strategy is oriented towards achievement of the five
major objectives such as: i) Reduce Inequalities in Access to Medical Care; ii) Improve Quality
of Medical Services; iii) Protect Patient’s Rights; iv) prevent diseases and assure preparedness
and response to health threats; and v) Improve Management of the Health Sector and Increase
Efficiency. The given strategy ensures sustainability of the project achievements.
HEALTH MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (HMIS) - Although it was originally
planned the project to invest in the development of the HMIS system, availability of the DFID
funds after the PHCDP effectiveness and the coordination efforts of the MOLHSA, the decision
has been made that the large part of required technical assistance planned under the project
(development of HMIS and database standardization) would be handed over to the DFID/OPM
project. MoLHSA with project support has developed new statistical forms 38 and after
evaluation of the pilot testing in Imereti and Adjara regions, modified accordingly and
institutionalized throughout the country. In 2006 the National Center for disease control and
Medical Statistics (CMIS) has been merged with the National Center for Disease Control and
Public Health       (NCDC&PH). Based on the request from MOLHSA project supported
rehabilitation and provision of required office and IT equipment to CMIS.
The MOLHSA intensified activities in this direction after restructuring. As the DFID/OPM failed
to produce quality outputs for HMIS, the decision have been made to work closely with USIAD
funded Health Systems Strengthening project. The work in this direction although initiated in
2011 is quite advanced and it is planned in phases. It ensures that is build based on international
standards, takes into account the world wide experience, and is developed in a participatory
manner involving all stakeholders with particular emphasis on private sector. It is planned that
HMIS alongside with the project supported SIMS will become an integral part of the sector’s e-
governance and be instrumental for evidence based policy development for the sector.

SOCIAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT (SIMS) - The government’s
major reform program of the health sector, which aimed at: i) increasing the private sector role
in health financing and service provision by privatizing public health facilities; ii) prioritizing
public funds to finance health care for the poor and other vulnerable groups; iii) channeling
public health financing through private health insurance companies, and iv) strengthening the
regulatory role of the MOLHSA, considered introduction of a unique information system for
the identification of all beneficiaries getting any benefit from the central budget. Its main
function is the assignment and distribution of different types of cash benefits including: state
pensions, means-tested targeted assistance, internally displaced person (IDP) allowance
distribution and countrywide childcare service management. One of the key strategic goals set
forth by the Social Service Agency (SSA) was to become the financial intermediary for all
operations conducted by all state agencies using public resources.
SSA database systems play a key role in enabling the SSA to fulfill this strategic function. At the
beginning, the SSA has multiple disparate database systems that share information amongst
themselves, with other agencies within the MOLHSA and with various other Ministries (Civil
Registry, Ministry of Refugees and Accommodation, etc.) in the GOG. These various
information silos within the SSA made it difficult and costly to fulfill its mission. Issues such as
data duplication, data quality, etc. were of special concern. In order to address this problem, the
MoLHSA and the SSA prioritized the development of a Social Information Management System
(SIMS) as a necessary and vital component of its overall IT strategy. The purpose of the SIMS
is: the integration of various internal SSA systems into a structured, authoritative data registry;
the provision of integrated information from this registry to external agencies; and the ingestion
of ancillary information from other agencies to the SSA so that SSA business processes may
function properly.
As the introduction of such system is time and resource consuming exercise, the MOLHSA, SSA
and donor agencies (WB, the USAID) agreed to apply a phased approach and divide tasks
amongst different implementing agencies. Phase I considered business process analysis being
supported by the USAID and resulted in the development of the Business Requirements
Document (BRD). The second phase planned the development of a technical and database
architecture based on BRD. This phase was supported by the project through provision of the
technical assistance. Furthermore the project has provided support for the development phase
(phase III) of SIMS . The development of SIMS, by establishing a single beneficiary data base
for all social programs, would strengthen the capacity of the MOLHSA to manage efficiently the
operation of the Mandatory Health Insurance for the Poor (MIP), as well as for different cash
benefits programs, such as state pensions, means-tested targeted. The funding was made
available for the IT equipment supply and installation of SIMS for MOLHSA and SSA. In
addition the project financed, procurement of the Microsoft License therefore supported
legalization of IT/ software products, introduction of the data security system design and testing
(work in ongoing and will be finalized by June 2012).
Factors Influencing Project Implementation and outcomes
Positive factors and events that influenced project Outcomes were:

                                                66
       Strong project coordination - the GHSPIC team, managed to use project resources in an
       effective and efficient manner by coordinating interventions between all interested donor
       projects.

       Strengthening human resource capacity – the staff interviewed in several institutions
       during the ICR acknowledged the positive role of the project in strengthening PHC
       services. The training presented opportunities for PHC staff to exchange experiences and
       learn about new techniques to enabling them to increase productivity and the quality of
       their work. The opportunity to be exposed to international best practice was also widely
       acknowledged as a strong element of the Project. Apart from above, building evidence
       based policy formulation capacity enabled the achievement of the project outcomes
       regardless of numerous changes in the health sector reform directions.

Less effective factors and events which influenced project’s Outcomes were:

       Frequent Change in the ministry leadership - Over the course of the project (2003 –
       2011) ministry leadership has been changed six times followed by the structural
       reorganization which negatively affected timely decision making process as well pace of
       project implementation. The implementation process was often put on hold and the
       emphasis was devoted towards building ownership of the project of the new ministry
       leadership.
       Radical changes in the direction of the health sector reforms- The government
       initiated privatization of health service provision system resulted in changes of the
       originally planned project interventions and non-achievement of the targeted project
       outcomes. Specifically, The privatization of the (PHC) by selling existing facilities to
       staff changed project emphasis from rehabilitation and equipment of the PHC clinics
       towards procurement of equipment for the privatized PHC clinics. Moreover, as a result
       of the hospital privatization reform, the Kutaisi MCH center, which has been partially
       renovated and equipped by the project, has been sold, thus leaving the project short-
       handed to provide planned MCH training package as per MOLHSA decision.
       Subsequently this sub-component was dropped and the remaining funds under the sub-
       component reallocated at the restructuring of the project.
       Changes in GHSPIC leaderships and staff – The appointment of the new Director and
       replacement of almost all key managers at the GHSPIC in 2004 created delays in project
       implementation, though the efforts and a proactive attitude of the new team picked up the
       implementation speed quickly.
       Russian Georgian Conflict - Ongoing local and international procurement procedures
       during the conflict were suspended. Moreover, the conflict hindered commencement of
       the primary health care personnel training in family medicine.
       Lengthy and delayed Project Restructuring - The Project restructuring process has
       been postponed for several times. The project restructuring has been initiated in May
       2007, but was not finalized due to the upcoming election in January 2008. After the
       election and appointment of a new Minister in February 2008, the Government informed
       the Bank that they would like to finalize the restructuring of the project after the
                                              67
        Parliament Election in May, 2008. This process has further been postponed by the
        Russian –Georgian conflict in August 2008. Finally the restructuring has been approved
        in summer 2009.


Capacity Building Achievements
Project was extremely successful to build local capacities and capabilities in number of areas
such as:
Family Medicine Faculty (FMF): Project established FMF is entirely integrated in the State
Medical University structure and is involved in provision of training for i) undergraduates; ii)
residents in Family Medicine; iii) TOT; and iv) clinical skill training for family physicians. FMF
is also heavily involved in the development and implementation of modern clinical guidelines
and treatment protocols.
Regional Family Medicine Training Centers (RFTMC): The project established all five
RFMTCs obtained nation accreditation and continue providing training service. They are
allowed to provide trainings for fee which ensures their sustainability and financial viability.
Health Policy Unit (HPU) - The original project developed analysis and evidence based policy
development function of the HPU became a main function of the Health Policy Department of
the MoLHSA. Main staff of the HPU has been promoted to different leading positions in the
ministry.
NHA - Since 2003, Georgia has passed long way until NHA was institutionalized in the Country.
The Georgia has been acknowledged to be the only country in the region been able to
institutionalize NHA and use for evidence based policy development by the WB 39. The NHA
was used to: i) examine health financing policy issues; ii) allocate government health care
funding to priority services and population; iii) compute policy related indicators such as: per
capita health spending, health expenditures as percentage of the GDP and different indicators; iv)
plan health care budget (medium term expenditure framework 2006-2010, program budgeting
process uses NHA results as a bases for evaluation and monitoring of annual outcomes;
technical documents of state health programs use NHA results to describe existing situation and
pricing the services); v) prepare report on distribution of health payments and catastrophic
expenditures; vi) by investors to plan hospital expenditures and revenues in hospital privatization
process; vii) to develop HIV/AIDS, TB, and Reproductive Health strategy.
HUES - The HUES methodology is institutionalized at the GeoStat and is implemented by the
Household Survey department with state budget funding
Treatment Guidelines – The MOLHSA jointly with Insurance Industry, New Hospital
Operators and Physician Association initiated revision of already developed guidelines and
development of the new ones according to the project produced guideline development
methodology being approved as a national standard. In order to enforce the implementation of

guidelines it has been agreed that: i) MOLHSA will demand the compliance with the new
guidelines as a contractual obligation to the providers contracted for state program
implementation; ii) The regulator will use the guidelines for the auditing the service quality; iii)
The insurance industry will demand the compliance with the new guidelines as a contractual
obligation for the providers; and iv) The Physicians Association will ensure: development of the
new guidelines; revision of the old ones; training of health providers and provision of supportive
supervision to the providers.
Health Management Training Capacity - The project established Health Management
Training Capacity in close partnership with USAID is sustained. At present, the Caucasus School
of Business and the University of Georgia are running the short-term certification courses as well
as Master’s courses in Health Management.
Nursing Education - The project was instrumental in building the nursing education system in
Georgia. At present the nursing education is upgraded to the Bachelor’s degree and the new
curriculum is introduced in five Medical Education Institutions in Tbilisi (3) and Adjara (2). All
these education facilities received national accreditation and the first cohort of students was
admitted in 2011.
Sustainability of Achieved Results
As on the one hand the WB support to the Health Sector is coming to the end and the financial
aid of other donor agencies are gradually decreasing and on the other hand the new health
reforms are under implementation, in order to sustain already achieved results and ensure
successful implementation of the reforms in 2011 the GOG has approved the new National
Health Strategy “Affordable and Quality Health Care 2011-2015? being adopted in November,
2011. The effective implementation of the new national strategy ensures that results achieved by
the “Health Sector Development Project? will be sustained. The strategy addresses the following
aspects:
IMPROVED ACCESS AND UTILIZATION OF HEALTH SERVICES
Hospital Sector - Within the frames of the health infrastructure development program, 150
medical facilities are targeted to be renovated and/or reconstructed by 2013. The new facilities
are expected to emerge on the principles of a referral network and will offer inpatient, outpatient
and pre?hospital (ambulance) services. At the same time, these facilities are expected to be multi?
profile, in order to provide greater comfort to patients. As a result, all Georgian citizens will be
able to receive high quality medical services in close proximity to their residences.
Primary Health Care - In order to improve access to PHCs, the government will contribute to
the functional integration of rural and district PHC facilities with other levels of medical care.
Ensuring a continuity of treatment, integration of preventive service delivery in PHCs, and
improving coordination of PHCs with other levels of medical services is the ultimate goal of this
integration. Moreover, PHCs will become fully integrated in the unified health information
system.

Access to medicines - In 2009, through amendments in the “Law on Drugs and Pharmaceutical
Activities? the government introduced mutual recognition and parallel import regimes to reduce
market entry barriers for new pharmaceuticals. Improving the population’s health and increasing
financial protection from ill health will not be possible without improved access to outpatient
                                               69
drugs. Therefore, under this strategic initiative the government plans to further increase
competition in the pharmaceutical market.

Expansion of Insurance Base - As of 2011, more than one million people are covered by state?
funded medical insurance, including more than 900,000 citizens living below the poverty line.
The goal of the government is to raise the number of insured people to at least 2.5 million by
2015, through a gradual increase in the number of insured people financed from the state budget.
Moreover, to increase the number of privately insured citizens and corporate insurance coverage,
the government plans to develop affordable and geographically accessible insurance products in
the insurance market as well as introduce the notion of minimal insurance coverage (the minimal
insurance package).

IMPROVED QUALITY OF SERVICES
In order to ensure that clinically necessary services are available at the right time and are
delivered from an adequately equipped facility and at an appropriate cost the government plans
to enhance:

Accreditation and Licensing of Health Facilities – The GoG plans to improve the system of
permits, which will define the list of minimal mandatory requirements to be met by the health
facility. These requirements will be geared towards assuring patients’ safety in a medical setting.
Apart from above, a voluntary accreditation system of medical facilities will be gradually
established. The status of accreditation, as an indicator of quality, is expected to increase the
competitiveness of accredited providers on the medical market. The Ministry will also foster the
development and introduction of an external quality control system for laboratories, the
supervision system over the quality of medical equipment and technologies as well as
continuously strengthen drug quality and safety mechanisms and supervision over efficient use
of medicines.

Clinical guidelines and protocols – The MoLHSA, in collaboration with professional
associations and healthcare investors, will support the development, implementation and regular
update of evidence?based guidelines and clinical protocols. Special attention will be paid to
improving the development of national clinical practice guidelines to ensure that
recommendations are effectively adapted to the local settings and compatible with local
technologies and available financial resources. In order to put the recommendations of clinical
guidelines and protocols into practice, MoLHSA will develop comprehensive contracting
mechanisms that will encourage a systematic evaluation of care quality that will serve as the
basis for reimbursement. This will foster development of the clinical audit system and create a
precondition for the enactment of outcome?oriented payment schemes. At the same time, a
diagnosis?related group (DRG) payment system will be introduced in the country.

Physician Certification - Doctors’ certification tools will be enhanced from 2012. Doctor
certification exams will focus more on the evaluation of clinical competencies and clinical
problem solving skills rather than knowledge assessment only. Accredited professional
associations are expected to play an active role in the development and implementation of these
mechanisms.

                                                70
Human Resources - Regulating the production of human resources for health is an essential pre?
requisite to balance health human resources with the population needs. Balancing the amount of
physicians and increasing the number of nurses is an essential pre?requisite to adequately meet
the country’s needs for health care personnel. Achieving the proper balance will help avoid:
unjustified costs spent on human resource development, undesirable clinical outcomes and the
challenges of employing an excessive number of physicians in the health sector.

STEWARDSHIP FUNCTION
Increasing role of the private sector in health care financing, in service provision, in medical
education, in the supply of medical equipment and medicines presents new challenges to the
state. In order to meet these challenges, it is essential to increase the role of the state in the
development and introduction of effective regulations and self regulation mechanisms.
Improving health management information systems is equally important in meeting these
challenges. Furthermore, these challenges pose greater demands for inter?sectoral coordination
and cooperation. Finally, for the efficient implementation of the strategy, generating scientific
evidence is necessary to ensure the permanent supervision of the strategy implementation
process.

ENHANCED INTER-SECTORAL COORDINATION
The new strategy priority direction requires efficient inter?sectoral coordination. The MOLHSA
plans to further extend and enhance the inter-sectoral coordination particularly in the areas of: i)
emergency and disaster preparedness; ii) to reduce road trauma iii) for health promotion and
implementation of a healthy lifestyle iii) To improve the health status of prison inmates; iv) for
the surveillance, prevention and control of communicable and non?communicable diseases v)
MOLHSA and the Ministry of Finance will actively cooperate in defining budgets for state
health programs and for medium?term expenditure planning.

Project Interaction with Stakeholders and other Projects
Effective coordination of donor funding mobilized in support of the PHC reform was a big
challenge for the MOLHSA, especially considering that DFID and EU strived to provide funding
for the same activities as the WB PHCDP project. The co-ordination framework was developed
and process formalized through PHC Coordination Board and Management Committee (PHC
MC). PHC MC was supported by DFID and, later on by the WHO. However the coordination
effort was not successful, mainly due to the lack of clearly defined sector policy and leadership.
Nevertheless, the GHSPIC and the WB team managed alongside with MOLHSA to take
proactive steps to coordinate activities in different project areas through regular formal and
informal coordination meetings, sharing supervision mission findings, updating on new sector
challenges etc. The examples of the MOLHSA coordinated arrangements are summarized in the
Table 2 below.

The World Bank Assistance
Extraordinary effort to work jointly with the Government Counterparts - Several Bank
teams made extraordinary efforts working jointly with Government counterparts to turn this
project around and to find alternative ways to improve project implementation.
Effective collaboration with partners - The Bank team tried its best to work in close
collaboration with all international donors and their implementing agencies, particularly with
DFID, EU, USAID, WHO, UNICEF and DTRA, working to ensure a consistent approach to the
health sector reforms and to build on other agencies’ experience and ongoing projects.
Responsiveness and flexibility of the Bank Team - The Bank team demonstrated good
examples of responsiveness in terms of the timely provision of No Objections, informed consent
for funding interventions not being originally planned, quickly responding to the Government
                                              72
needs, and flexibility in modification of implementation plans as well as project design. The
restructuring of the given project is a good example of effective WB Team work. The Bank
management supported several extensions of the loan to give a chance for this project to work.
Professionalism of the WB Team and strong local presence - The WB team, although
changed frequently, was always represented by high quality experts in their respective fields able
to lead effective advocacy as well as provide on-job training to the national counterparts. It is
worth of mentioning that the MOLHSA and GHSPIC immensely benefited by having the TTL
and the Procurement Advisor located in the country. The given arrangement alongside with the
professional staff allowed high responsiveness from the WB team.
Effective Supervision -The skills mix of the supervision team was adequate, comprising HQ-
based and Georgia-base staff, as well as international partners. Missions were effective in
reviewing all aspects of project-specific progress. Project supervision promoted strong
coordination arrangements among a great number of government and international partners. Aide
Memoires (AM) were prepared, shared and discussed with national and international
stakeholders. AMs always identified key implementation issues and suggested ways to resolve
them.


Lessons Learned
PROJECT DESIGN
      Comprehensive needs assessment and appraisal of the GOG’s health strategy undertaken
       before project design and during the implementation, and interventions targeted at
       meeting GOG’s strategic objectives played an important role to ensure attainment of the
       PDOs. It also enabled the borrower and the Bank to restructure the project mainly
       focusing on institutional development aspects of the new reforms.
      In a context of modernization and reform of a sector, keeping flexibility in design is key
       to allow the Borrower and the Bank to explore new venues and to adapt to the changes in
       a highly volatile sector context, while the definition of reforms is taking place. The
       flexibility in project design allowed for timely adjustments in the agreed implementation
       strategy, as the country's needs and priorities evolved.

INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
      GHSPIC, a subordinated structure to the MOLHSA, staffed with professional, well
       educated experts, with clear functions and responsibilities for the total period of project
       realization including period of preparation and completion alongside with clearly defined
       mechanisms of cooperation between GHSPIC and corresponding MOLHSA structures,
       played an important role in relatively smooth and effective project implementation. The
       given governance structure allowed the GHSPIC to minimize implementation bottlenecks
       in the environment of frequent changes of the management teams at MOLHSA over the
       course of the project.
      Continuity of staff is a critical element of project success/failure. In spite of changes
       introduced in the management of the GHSPIC, the core team of experts responsible for
       the operations and project components remained mainly unchanged which consequently
                                                  73
      guaranteed maintaining institutional memory as well as smoothing new management’s
      learning curve in project implementation
IMPLEMENTATION
     Expectations for fast and successful implementation of projects in countries with rapidly
      changing political environments should be restrained and some delays should be expected.
      This project serves as a good example of slow implementation due to the changing policy
      environment which resulted in numerous project extensions.
     Difficulties in project implementation must not be allowed to linger and should be
      proactively addressed as being demonstrated by this project. All parties involved should
      remain flexible and open to alternatives and options should be examined jointly,
      weighing all benefits and risks, before major decisions are taken by either side. This
      project is a good example of realistic assessment of progress which guided effective
      project restructuring.

PROJECT OWNERSHIP
     Leadership and ownership of the reforms pursued by the Project were crucial to its
      success. In the case of the Project, there was strong commitment not only from the
      Ministers of the MOLHSA, but also from the Prime Minister’s Office to bring about
      reform which were central in improving the efficiency of the health service delivery
      system and subsequently improving access to basic health services for the population.
      Georgia was politically committed to raising the health status of the poorest through
      modernization of health services delivery and reforms its operations for serving the poor
      population better. The GoG made a decision to finance what it takes to provide a basic
      package of health care services to the poorest layers of population residing in the country.

DONOR COORDINATION

     Management and supervision of projects/programs where many partners are involved
      should be a joint exercise during the entire project period. Information sharing of all
      relevant documents among partners is critical for sustained success of projects and for
      ensuring consistency of messages and coordination of inputs.
     Understanding the roles and reaching agreements with technical agencies and
      development partners can optimize benefits of programs. This project is a good example
      of demonstrated coordination of development partners as well as different structures of
      the GoG. Thorough analysis of the coordination efforts deployed in the project clearly
      shows that the investments funded by partners have complemented those under the
      Project, thereby reducing duplication of efforts and investments.

THE WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE

     Providing continuous guidance and actively engaging with counterparts in seeking
      solutions to challenges as they emerge was critical in the successful implementation of


                                              74
    the Project. A focus on identifying problems and seeking solutions as a coherent,
    collaborative World Bank client team was important for achieving results.
   Technical and timely support for fiduciary tasks provided by the World Bank is highly
    valued. With limited experience in implementation of the World Bank’s procurement
    guidelines and financial management requirements, it was important receive on-the-job
    training and to make available training courses/workshops to build the capacity of the
    GHSPIC in procurement and financial management.
   The project immensely benefited by the continuous technical support provided by the
    WB team. Especially country presence of the TTL and the Procurement Advisor enabled
    the GHSPIC to react in a timely manner to the bottlenecks faced during the project.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners and Stakeholders


•      EU delegation to Georgia (e-mail, December 5, 2012) - The WB and the EU PHC
support projects had complimentary and even joint actions (like development of the guidelines &
protocols, Family doctors trainings', cooperation with NICE, etc.)
•       WHO (e-mail, December 17, 2012) - The WB project conceived for 2002, due to specific
political situation in the country, started in 2004 and lasted till 2012. It is important to mention
that the project initially focusing on strengthening PHC, due to changes in political situation and
specifically in Health Sector after certain time the project responding to changing requirements
also changed the initial scope and encompassed different directions.
Focusing on PHC development, along with other Donors such as EU, DFID, USAID, and
together with Government, it also made a focus on improving health infrastructure.
More the hundred PHC facilities were constructed or rehabilitated and equipped by the project
and 25-bed hospital was built in Ambrolauri, the infrastructure was seriously improved and rural
population got better access to a PHC centers in many regions of Georgia, to name some of them
-Imereti, Adjara, etc. With support of this project coverage and utilization of quality primary
health care based on a model of family medicine and general practice, was significant increased
throughout the country particularly for vulnerable population.
It should be mentioned specifically that very important was that during the reported period 40
guidelines have been developed by World Bank and EC-funded project and accordingly rural
doctors have been trained in new clinical guidelines.
Through the cascades of such trainings more than half of all PHC doctors and nurses were
trained in regional family medicine training centers which also were rehabilitated and equipped
in frame of WB project and as a result almost all rehabilitated facilities had trained doctors,
nurses, and basic equipment for family medicine.
In 2008 due to the WB assistance the government introduced the Medical Insurance Program for
the Poor (MIP), which was very important step in social policy for covering the most vulnerable
group of population.
Due to frequent changes in health sector policy directions, the project was restructured, to adjust
initial project objectives to new health reform program. The very important was the support
provided to development of Health Information System, support for legislative basis, etc.
From WHO perspective I would like particularly to mention the Health System Performance
Assessment (HSPA) which was special example of effective t collaboration between WB, WHO
and HSPA working group established at the MoLHSA, 2007-09. Georgia was one of the pilot
countries for HSPA, findings were presented to all partners at the conference organized upon
completion of first assessment and the Georgian HSPA report was presented at the WHO

                                                78
Regional Office for Europe. Currently the HSPA is successfully institutionalized and carried out
by the MoLHSA of Georgia.
That WB project focusing on different direction including strengthening of Primary Health Care
– including improving infrastructure as well as development of Human Resources, Health
Information System Management (HMIS), Health System Performance Assessment (HSPA) , etc,
was extremely important and made significant contribution in the process of development of
Health Sector and capacity building for maintaining of Quality Health Services especially during
specific period when leadership in MoLHSA was changing several times often changing the
declared vision of Health Sector Development. Collaboration of WHO and WB was very
important during these years and further WB projects for Health System Strengthening can play
specially important role.
•       USAID (e-mail, December 17, 2012) - We have a dual feeling while hearing about
completion of the World Bank Health Sector Development Project in Georgia. From one side it's
a sad moment for all of us not to have a reliable donor partner in our future activities, but at the
same time you should be proud of the project's achievements. Despite of the rapidly transforming
policy environment in Georgia's health sector over last eight years, project managed to make
significant contributions both to the modernization of health sector infrastructure in the country,
as well as policy changes that resulted in improved access to health services by the vulnerable
population groups.
Over those elapsed years various USAID health projects cooperated productively with the World
Bank project. I can recall the most recent initiative of developing health and social information
management system - a pillar for the well functioning social sector in Georgia. These and other
collaborative donor initiatives catalyzed positive changes, enabling the country to rely more on
own resources - both financial as well as intellectual.
