1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Prior to 1991, the Republic of Moldova's social insurance system could not deliver
effective social protection due to its inadequate social policy framework, fragmented
institution structure, and weak administrative capacity. For example, the responsibilities
of social tax collection and inspection were not clear and the management of the pension
system was inadequate and inefficient. The accounting practices of the pension system
were not consistent with international standards, and there were limited internal controls
in place to ensure financial integrity. There was also limited information sharing on social
policy issues across Government ministries. In addition, there was inadequate awareness
of the public about their responsibilities in the pension system.

The economic difficulties at the time further undermined the sustainability of the social
insurance system. In 1992, inflation rose to 1,276 percent. However, due to the faster
pace of transition, inflation had declined to 30 percent by 1995. By 1997, real GDP in
Moldova was about 38 percent of its GDP in 1990 (Figure 1 shows the decline in real
GDP in the 1990s). The drop in GDP was compounded by the regional crisis that led to a
further decline by 8.6 percent in 1998. Public sector expenditure arrears rose to about
11.4 percent of GDP by the end of 1998. The fiscal crisis at the time sharply increased
arrears in wages and pension payments, further lowering the purchasing power of wage
earners, pensioners, and the poor. In May 1997, 35 percent of Moldovans were poor
(World Bank, 2000). However, the regional crisis in 1998 further worsened the poverty
situation. By the end of 1998, the number of Moldovans who were poor rose to 46
percent and reached 55 percent by end of 1999 (Figure 2). In addition, income inequality
increased. In 1987/88, the Gini coefficient (where zero reflects perfect equality and 100
total inequality) was 24, increased to 34.4 by 1992, and had reached 40 by 1997.

By 1998, the social insurance system was characterized by huge pension arrears, delays
in pension payments, inadequate capacity to collect social revenue, a high proportion of
in-kind contributions (defined as non-monetary payments of pension [e.g., clothes, and
food items]) and a weak social fund (hereafter, the National Social Insurance House
[NSIH]1) budget. The economic difficulties contributed to the failure of enterprises and
other businesses leading to an adverse effect on the financial standing of the pension
system. During 1998, the collection rate of cash contributions was only 44 percent of the
budgeted revenue, and in-kind contributions accounted for 43 percent of total social



1The NSIH is a legal entity and an autonomous public institution established in 2001 charged with the
responsibility of the administration and supervision of social insurance. It is responsible for the collection
of social insurance contributions and distribution of collected funds to eligible beneficiaries. The NSIH
integrated the departments of pension, social fund, and computer centre, formerly in the Ministry of Labour
and Social protection (MLSPF).

contributions. Over 1997-1999, arrears of contribution payers to the NSIH exceeded 350
million lei in 1999 (Figure 3) and the average delay in paying pensions was about 5
months. Over 1995-1998, the minimum size of the old age pension was 62 lei per year. It
increased to only 65 lei per year over 1999-2000. The replacement rate defined as the
ratio of average pension size to average salary, declined (Figure 4). At the same time,
regional disparities in pension payment had escalated, whereby the large urban centers,
Chisinau and Balti, had no pension payment arrears while other regions had accumulated
arrears.

Since 1997 onwards, the Government with the assistance of development partners such as
the World Bank and the European Union (EU) embarked upon reforms of the pension
system. The Ministry of Labor, Social Protection and Family (MLSPF) started working
on a longer term pension strategy. A long term pension strategy paper was produced in
1997, and the legislation was developed in October 1997. Following the elections in
March 1998, the new Government declared its intentions to further discussions toward
reform of the pension system. The pension reform legislation had a second and final
reading in October 1998 and was passed. The new legislation removed all the previous


                                                                                                    2

pension privileges, and provided a link between social contributions paid and pensions
earned. While progress was made in the overall pension policy, the Government of
Moldova's state social insurance system suffered from: (i) lack of coherent approach in
policy analysis, monitoring and evaluation; (ii) inadequate capacity; (iii) inconsistent
organizational structure and weak administration; and (iv) lack of public communication
strategy on pension issues.

Against this background, the Government with the support of the World Bank embarked
on implementing the Social Protection Management Project. The project aimed at
contributing to the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) objective of reaching out to the
poor through clearer spending priorities, improved access to services, and longer term
reform of core social and communal services. A policy dialogue established through the
supervision of the Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) II laid the ground for the project's
objective of institutional strengthening and reorganization. The introduction of the
pension reform was expected to reduce the need for general budget subsidies and
encourage individuals to take greater responsibility for their own future pension position.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

(as approved)

The objective of the project was to develop the capacity required to implement the
pension reform and to support the development of an efficient and sustainable social
protection system in Moldova.

The key outcome indicators were:

  i.   increase of contributions to the NSIH;
  ii.  on time payment of pensions;
 iii.  transparent budgeting and accounting practice of the NSIH;
 iv.   improved management of the NSIH;
  v.   efficient information support through improved IT system;
 vi.   strengthened social protection policy support; and
vii.   increased awareness of the public regarding the pension system.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

The PDO and key indicators were not revised during the implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The public was the ultimate beneficiary of an improved pension and social protection
system. Pensioners were expected to benefit from timely payments of pensions,
calculated in a fair and transparent manner, and provided in a more client-oriented
manner. The project also aimed at benefiting contributors who are not of pension age
through information programs which could help them to better understand the pension
system.


                                            3

The MLSPF, the NSIH and the State Tax Office (STO) were the beneficiaries of the
project through strengthened institutional capacity. The local offices of the NSIH and the
MLSPF were expected to become more accountable and responsive to the needs of the
pensioners. Through strong collaboration in social policy analysis and monitoring, other
expected beneficiaries included the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Ministry of
Economy and Reform (MOER). Information sharing and communication on pension
issues (e.g., between NSIH and STO) were expected to improve.

1.5 Original Components

(as approved)

The SPM project included the following four components:

Component I: Social Protection Policy Analysis, Monitoring and Evaluation (Total
estimated base cost U$ 0.58 million)

This component aimed at building the capacity of the MLSPF to develop the social
protection policies and to monitor policy impacts on a regular basis. It also aimed at
establishing the Social Policy Unit (SPU) within the MLSPF, which would: (i) analyze
social protection issues, with state pensions as the focus at the initial stage; (ii) develop
key indicators to evaluate social protection policies; and (iii) provide key policy
recommendations. The outputs of the unit would consist of the production of Annual
Social Reports (ASRs) on social protection developments in Moldova, and policy notes
analyzing specific social protection policy issues. The SPU was expected to work closely
with other departments of the MLSPF to ensure that the policies could be effectively
implemented.

Component II: Social Protection Administration (total estimated base cost US$ 10.5
million)

This component aimed at developing the administrative capacity necessary for the
implementation of the pension reform by assisting the NSIH and its local office, and the
MLSPF, to clearly define the organizational functions and structure, and to strengthen
their capacity to administer the calculation and delivery of pensions and cash benefits.

This project was to contribute to the modernization of the NSIH by supporting the
implementation of the IT system. This system was expected to provide for the storage of
all social contribution information on individual/personal accounts and for the retrieval,
and use of that information in the calculation and payment of pensions and other benefits.
The project aimed at supporting the acquisition of software for use in facilitating more
efficient exchange of information between the MLSPF and STO. In addition, the project
aimed at providing technical assistance and training to the STO.




                                              4

Component III: Public Information Provision and Communication (total estimated
base cost US$ 0.53 million)

This component aimed at strengthening the capacity of the MLSPF in designing and
implementing a comprehensive public information and communications strategy. A
communications unit (CU) was to be established at the MLSPF. The CU was expected to:
(i) establish regular communication channels in order to communicate policy messages
on behalf of the MLSPF; (ii) convey necessary information to the public regarding their
rights and responsibility in the pension system; and (iii) provide key administrative
information to the management of various departments in the MLSPF. Other
responsibilities of the CU would be to assist the MLSPF in assessing the current level of
understanding of the social protection system, in monitoring the progress of increasing
awareness; and to develop a standard reporting system within the MLSPF. Information
brochures and booklets on social protection policies were to be produced for both internal
and external audiences.

Component IV: Project Coordination (total estimated base cost US$ 0.54 million).

This component aimed at providing the resources to effectively manage the project. A
project coordination unit (PCU) was to be established within the MLSPF. The unit was to
be staffed with a director, a procurement officer, a financial officer, and support staff.
The objective of building the structure of a PCU within the MLSPF was to ensure a full
greater integration of the project in the daily business of the MLSPF. Other items under
this component included the financing of operational expenses of the PCU, including
staff salaries, technical assistance, translations, project auditing and consumables
throughout the life of the project.


1.6 Revised Components

The project components were not revised during implementation.


1.7 Other significant changes

The project closing date was extended twice. The first extension was from March 31,
2005 to December 31, 2006. The second extension was granted from December 31, 2006
to March 31, 2007. Both extensions were requested by the Government to ensure the
effective completion of the IT systems by the NSIH.

Another change, which had no negative financial implications on the project, occurred in
June 2006, when the Bank, at the request of the Government, transferred project savings
in the amount of 700,000 SDR to the Avian Influenza project.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

There was no formal quality at entry review. However, based on the review at the ICR
stage, the Quality at Entry was satisfactory.

Analytical basis for Program Design, which included the Bank's Economic Sector
Work (ESW) and intensive dialogue with relevant counterparts. The analytical work
included: a Poverty Assessment in 1998 carried out in collaboration with the Ministry of
Economy and Reform (MOER); a Pension Survey; a Household Budget Survey (HBS) in
1997 implemented by the Department of Statistics with the assistance of the Bank; policy
dialogue in implementing the SAL; and technical assistance to implement a Social
Expenditure Review (SER) in 1999.

Joint Participatory Process. The project concept was developed by stakeholders during
a workshop conducted in October 1998. The stakeholders were drawn from MOER, MOF,
STO, NGOs, research institutions, employers' organizations, pensioners' associations,
trade unions, and development partners. The development partners involved in various
consultative processes since project inception included the Department for International
Development (DfiD), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the EU-Food
Security Programme, and Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA). The
project team also consulted with the Parliament social and budgetary committees.

Appraisal of Skills base and IT Needs. To support the MLSPF's administrative
capacity, a systematic appraisal of the skills base was arranged together with a
comprehensive training needs analysis. The training program contained business planning
and organization, use of management and financial information and risk analysis, along
with improved accounting and auditing procedures. To support the development of an IT
system, an assessment of the existing capacity and IT needs at all levels was conducted at
the inception of the project with the support of a Japan Policy and Human Resources
Development (PHRD) grant.

Project Design. The project focused mostly on old age pensions and was not expected to
address all the problems of the social protection system in Moldova. Other areas of
pension (e.g. disability and gender issues) were covered under the PHRD grant. Instead,
it aimed at impacting social protection through the establishment of analytical capacity in
social policy analysis at the MLSPF. The development objective as it stands seems too
inclusive in this respect. In addition, some indicators in the PAD were unclear.

It was debated whether to include the public information provision and communications
component as a sub-component of the administration component. However, it was
decided to keep it as an independent component since it would be necessary to develop
communications at all levels within the MLSPF, among Parliamentarians, and with the
public. The decision to support improved communications was based on the fact that the
public were poorly informed about their rights and obligations in the pension system.



                                              6

Project Management Arrangements. It was debated whether to have the PCU located
in the MLSPF or in other ministries or to be established as an independent unit. Given the
responsibilities of the MLSPF, and the Government's long term goal to improve core
social services, it was decided to locate the unit within the MLSPF.

Assessment of Anticipated Risks. Risks were divided into: (i) general risks, which are
country-specific (e.g. stability of the macroeconomic environment) and are mainly
outside the control of the project, but could have an impact on the project; and (ii)
project-related risks, which could be mitigated to some extent through project design and
high quality supervision. It was observed that while the possibility of general risks was
quite high, their impacts on the project were considered to be medium. For the project-
related risks, the project would provide coping mechanisms and close monitoring to
mitigate the risks.

2.2 Implementation

There was no QAG assessment during the project supervision stage. Based on the review
at the ICR stage, the project implementation is assessed as satisfactory. Overall, despite
the delayed IT contract, the merger of the ministries and the pension policy reversal
during the project life, the project was implemented well and as a result, achieved on
almost all of its indicators.

The merger of the MLSPF and the MOH resulted into a new organizational structure at
the Ministry of Health and Social Protection (MoHSP) in which the CU ceased to exist.
In addition, DfiD co-funding of the CU ended in 2004 raising further concerns as to
whether the ministry would take up full financing of the CU. The reorganizations
negatively affected monitoring of the project's progress with respect to public awareness
of the pension system and in developing a standard reporting system within the ministry.
For example, since the last two opinion surveys in 2001 and 2004, no recent survey
eliciting information on the pensioners' awareness of the pension system has been carried
out.

Another setback was the pension policy reversal which resulted in putting on hold the
retirement age increase in 2001, revising the pension formula several times, and the
delayed completion of the NSIH record system. To prevent further reversals, SAC III
included conditions on continuation of the pension reform. On a positive side, the Bank
supervision teams held discussions with Government on the negative implications of ad
hoc pension policy reversals. The teams noted, among others, that the pension system
was faced with the challenges of relatively low levels of pension benefits, and the
substantial redistribution of pension payments from non-agricultural workers to
agricultural workers. The Bank team continued efforts to increase awareness and
commitment of the Government to pension reform and its expected impact on the project
as well as the future position of the pension system. This is evident from the policy
dialogue, Aide-Memoire, management letters and workshops organized to discuss the
state of Moldova's social protection policies and implications for the wellbeing of the
Moldovan population. During the mid-term review held in March 2003, the progress,
risks and possible remedies facing the project were discussed. The World Bank also


                                              7

played a leading role in coordinating with other donors (e.g., DfiD, UNDP, EU, and
SIDA) who provided support to the project.

Project implementation benefited from technical assistance from the Bank as well as
capacity building. Ministry officials participated in training and study tours to Greece,
Poland and Latvia to learn about the different pension systems. The availability of a
PHRD grant facilitated the provision of technical assistance to the ministry and NSIH.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The project was to be measured against 7 outcome plus 13 output indicators (as presented
in the ICR datasheet). Progress against these indicators was regularly monitored. The
project achieved its objectives and most indicators (90%) are fully achieved despite the
reversals in policy and changes in the Ministry structures.

However, due to the fact that the framework contained repetitious indicators in some
cases, it was difficult to keep track of a concise and updated M & E framework during the
supervision of the project.

In facilitating the SPU's monitoring and evaluation role, the project supported and
strengthened the capacity to analyze social protection policies. A database on social
protection issues was developed and regularly updated by the SPU. The database contains
data on different types of pensions disaggregated by age, gender, and occupation. The
SPU also collects data on the revenues and expenditures of the NSIH, and data on social
assistance types and benefits. This database is a source of information used in the
production of the ASRs and policy reports that are used for regular monitoring and
evaluation of the project. As evident from the Bank supervision documents, this
information was utilized by the supervision teams to report on the progress of the project.

A key development during the project was the institutionalization of the SPU within the
ministry. This created the foundation for sustaining the M & E arrangements not only for
the project but also for the overall monitoring of the effectiveness of the SP system.
While the establishment of the SPU was a very positive step, the ministry has had
problems in retaining staff. As a result, there is limited capacity in the SPU.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

During implementation, there was full safeguard and fiduciary compliance.

In terms of environmental impact, the project carried out some civil works but of very
limited nature, which did not affect the environment. An environmental data sheet was
completed for the project in January 1999 confirming this assessment.

Looking at the entire project, past financial audits conducted by Bank specialists on
financial management issues were rated satisfactory (i.e. internal controls and procedures
for the project's implementation were in place and that the financial reporting and system
and audit arrangements were adequate and in compliance with all the financial covenants


                                              8

in the Development Credit Agreement). Similarly, independent auditor reports provided
unqualified opinions. A total of more than 15 audit reports were received by the Bank-
with 8 financial management reviews received from the PCU ad 2 from the NSIH. The
audit opinions of the PCU by Deloitte Touch over the period 2001-2006 were
unqualified. As of December, 2006, there were no outstanding audit reports.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

In order to ensure sustainability of the pension system in Moldova, there is a need to
ensure policy consistency in implementing the pension reforms, continuation of capacity
building and maintenance of the monitoring and evaluation of social protection policies.
To address these issues, the Government developed the 2004-2006 Economic Growth and
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP) that was endorsed by the Board in
November 2004. The EGPRSP served the basis for the preparation of the new 2005-2008
CAS. Social Protection is one of the priorities identified in the EGPRSP. The three areas
of improvement include: strengthening pension system by furthering reforms of disability
and survivors insurance, reform of the farmers' pension; elimination of pension
privileges; and simplifying the pension administration.

Equally important is the sustainability of the IT system. In accordance with the terms of
the contract regarding the development and installation of the IT system, Intracom will,
for a period of three years, ensure the warranty of the equipment and of the software.
Following that period, NSIH will maintain the system with own funds. It is therefore
important that the NSIH prepares to take up this role as it is critical to the sustainability
of the project outcomes.

The ongoing Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 3) provides critical support to
build on the achievements made under the project. It is supporting: (i) the establishment
of the individual accounts for 100 percent of all pension contributors; (ii) implementation
of the pension reform strategy to unify the pension system for all types of pensioners
(non-agricultural, agricultural and privileged); and (iii) making progress in linking
benefits to contributions. The PRSC also plans to monitor progress in increasing the
effectiveness of social assistance expenditures in reaching the poor.

To continue to support the Government's strategy in this area, the Board has also
approved a follow-up project on "Health Services and Social Assistance". With reference
to social assistance, the project seeks to improve the efficiency of Government spending
on social planning by targeting the transfers to the poorest Moldovans. The project is
expected to increase the effectiveness of budget execution with the aim of reducing
poverty, among beneficiaries.

  3. Assessment of Outcomes

  3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

  Evidence from ESW, CAS (1999-2004; 2005-2008) and the ASRs shows that the PDO
  and project components design and implementation were relevant at the time of project
  inception and remain relevant to date. Social protection is among the key issues discussed
  in the CAS that the Government will continue to focus.

  3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

  Overall, the project achieved its objectives and most indicators (90%) are fully achieved
  despite the delayed IT contract, the merger of the ministries, and the pension policy
  reversal during the project life. The project was to be measured against 7 outcome plus 13
  output indicators (as presented in the ICR datasheet).

  The ICR concludes that the project has achieved its development objective in a
  satisfactory way as demonstrated through the accomplishment of the targets set out in
  outcome and output indicators in the results framework. For each indicator, the team
  compares what has been accomplished with what was in place at project inception to
  draw a conclusion. The achievement of the project development objective with reference
  to the main 7 key performance indicators is as follows:

i.    Increase of contributions to the NSIH (Achievement unclear). As shown in Figure
      5 the number of contributors has not consistently increased over the project life. It is
      important to understand the possible factors, such as migration, tax avoidance and the
      pension policy reversal, all outside the control of the project that might have affected
      this outcome. More importantly, however, the NSIH turned around its deficit of 259.2
      million lei in 1999 to a budget surplus of 642 million lei as of December, 2006.


                                    Figure 5. Number of contributors (in million)

          Source: Annual Social Reports and World Bank.

ii.   On time payment of pensions (fully achieved). Relative to the baseline where
      pension payments were delayed for about 5 months, pensions are now paid within 1
      month of the due date. This has been partly due to the improved efficiency in
      processing pensions and the improved viability of the NSIH budget. As of December


                                                  10

      2006, the NSIH had a surplus of 642 million lei; almost two and half times larger than
      the deficit it ran in 1999. Figure 6 shows the NSIH total revenues and expenditures as
      a ratio of GDP over 2003-2008. All together, the financial position of the NSIH is
      sound and thus, ensures that pension payments are paid on time.

iii.  Transparent budgeting and accounting practices of the NSIH (fully achieved).
      Relative to the baseline of no transparent budgeting (i.e., with in-kind contributions
      constituting 28.7 percent) and accounting practices that were not consistent with
      international practices, the project has contributed to improved transparency of the
      NSIH. In addition, in-kind contributions have been eliminated.

    International accounting standards are practiced by the NSIH. The financial statements
    of the NSIH have since 2002 been audited annually in accordance with International
    Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) published by the International Accounting
    Standards Board (IASB). In addition, the regional NSIH offices are internally audited
    by the NSIH central audit.

iv.   Improved management of the NSIH (fully achieved). Relative to the baseline of an
      inadequate and inefficient management of the pension system, the project has helped
      establish the NSIH and developed its capacity to develop sound business plans. NSIH
      staff have been trained in business planning and management. The number of NSIH
      staff trained in business planning and management is about 50 persons, including all
      managers from territorial offices.

 v.   Efficient information support of the NSIH (fully achieved). Relative to the baseline
      of no personal accounts and IT system in place, the project has helped to develop the
      IT system and establish personal accounts. As of end of 2006, personal IDs have been



                                                       11

     issued to 96 percent of pensioners and 74 percent of the pensioners had personal
     accounts. Despite the delayed implementation of the IT system, it was
     developed/installed and currently functioning in all NSIH central and regional offices.

vi.  Strengthened policy support (fully achieved). This indicator was fulfilled in a
     satisfactory way. Relative to the baseline of irregular policy analysis, monitoring and
     evaluation, the project helped the ministry to establish and institutionalize the SPU
     unit. In addition, the capacity of the SPU staff in policy analysis and evaluation has
     been strengthened. The SPU prepares ASRs analyzing social protection issues in
     Moldova. At the end of the project, two ASRs were produced with budget funds. In
     addition, the SPU contributed chapters on social protection issues in the EGPRSP and
     the MTEF. However, due to staff turnover in the ministry, partly due to low
     remuneration, the project's activities were to some extent negatively affected.

vii. Increased awareness of the public regarding the pension system (partially
     achieved).

     A communications unit (CU) was established with parallel co-financing under the
     DfiD. The CU was expected to coordinate programs aimed at increasing awareness of
     the public regarding the pension system. During its existence, a communications
     strategy was developed, an Advisory group on publicity (composed of officials from
     the ministry, NSIH, the Independent Journalism Center, and the DfiD office) was
     established in the ministry. Press coverage of pension reform increased. A Television
     (TV) program was prepared and broadcasted. In addition, publicity leaflets were
     produced and distributed to all judets. Other accomplishments included the training of
     journalists on social protection policies and at the same time actively engaging them
     in writing and creating programmes about social protection. A resource center
     accessible to the journalists and the public was established within the ministry.
     "Probably" as a result of increased public awareness, the personal contributions to the
     state pensions rose from 1,005 million MDL in 2000, 1,275 million MDL in 2001,
     1,602 million MDL in 2002, to 1,785 million MDL in 2003.

     Evidence based on two opinion surveys conducted in 2001 and 2004 indicated that
     the CU helped in increasing client knowledge about the pension system. The CU used
     to announce the press coverage of pension issues on a competitive basis. This ensured
     the selection of competent providers of valuable communication messages about the
     pension system to the public through various media (e.g., Radio, Television, News
     Conferences, website, and flyers). With reference to the 2001 and 2004 opinion
     surveys, the respondents were asked what factors influenced their pensions. Over the
     same period, respondents who said that their pensions depended on: (i) years worked-
     --increased from 57 percent to 69 percent; (ii) contributions to NSIH--- increased 17
     percent to 26 percent; and (iii) number of years contributions paid ---increased 17
     percent to 26 percent.

     However, with the reorganization that led to the merger of the Ministry of Health
     with the Ministry of Social Protection and Family, the CU disappeared from the new



                                              12

    ministry's organizational structure. By the end of 2006, the two ministries had been
    split again and it was unclear whether the unit would resurrect again. Despite the
    efforts toward institutionalization of the unit in the ministry such as the creation of an
    information center, formally-the library, the restructuring of the ministry was a major
    setback for the sustainability of this unit's achievements.

    On a positive note, however, the NSIH established a communications section that
    provides public awareness by disseminating a monthly news letter known as the
    "Social Insurance" published in Romanian and Russian Languages. The NSIH
    distributes nearly 10,000 copies of the news letter to local levels, public places,
    ministries, parliament, civil society including employers' associations and trade union.

    A webpage (http://pension.md) was also launched using PHRD funds as part of the
    campaign to disseminate information on Moldova's pension system. The webpage
    contains information on the development of the pension system. It includes, among
    others, reports on the pension system, ASRs, legislative acts, and descriptions of the
    pension related models that have been developed.


3.3 Efficiency

During project preparation, no quantitative economic analysis was conducted. However,
it was argued that the project would help to generate fiscal savings due to improved
capacity in implementing pension reform and development of an efficient and sustainable
social protection system. Fiscal savings were anticipated to accrue due to lower pension
expenditure and higher social tax revenue. It was hypothesized that a one percent growth
of collection rate would have led to an increase in social tax revenue of over 9.5 million
lei in 1998 alone. Other non quantifiable benefits envisaged included administrative
savings due to: reduced processing time for recording, calculating and paying pensions;
reduced resources needed to ensure low error rate; and savings due to improved
accounting practices and internal control. Finally, the benefits of improved policy
analysis, monitoring and evaluation were expected to spillover to other segments of the
economy.

Judged against the project indicators discussed above, the project has contributed
significant benefits relative to its costs. These benefits included the elimination of
pension arrears and in-kind contributions, establishment of a functioning SPU that
produces analytical reports on social policy issues, improved organizational structure of
the NSIH (practicing transparent budget and accounting), developed the IT system that
facilitates calculation of pensions, and thus enhances on time payment of pensions. The
IT system allows the STO to obtain more information on non-tax payers thereby
facilitating active social tax collection enforcement. The benefits of the SPU are reflected
nationally as evident from its production of the ASRs and contribution to the EGPRSP
process.




                                              13

In general, despite the institutional and policy changes during the project life, the project
was implemented efficiently; most of the indicators were achieved. The functioning of
the IT system is expected to enhance the project outcomes.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The objective of the project was and remains relevant and consistent with the CAS
objectives. Despite the delays in implementation, the project was implemented within
budget. As detailed above, there was substantial progress made against almost all
outcome and output indicators. Given all these significant achievements, the project
deserves a Satisfactory rating for outcome for all intents and purposes.

This view is strongly supported by the Government assessment of the project (see Annex
7) where the MOHSP rates the project as Satisfactory. This ICR rates the overall outcome
of the project as Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

As indicated above, the improved capacity of the SPU has led to its increased
contribution to poverty, gender and social development through production of the ASRs,
chapter on EGPRSP, and policy notes on social policy issues and poverty in Moldova.
With the support of the PHRD grant, the Government has developed the farmers' pension
strategy, and incorporated gender and disability in the pension analysis. The CU and the
NSIH contributed to improved public awareness about the pension system in Moldova.
The public is arguably much more aware of its responsibilities in the pension system than
it was prior to the project. In addition, the timely payment of pensions and benefits
supported by the project has had a substantial impact on ensuring that eligible recipients
are provided with a continuous flow of resources.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project provided capacity building for staff from the NSIH and the MLSPF. The
capacity of the NSIH was increased at both the central and local levels. Training
activities in social protection policies contributed to the project's accomplishments. For
example, as part of improving the analytical capacity of the staff, a group of NSIH
specialists (developers, users, managers) visited Greece to get familiar with the operation
of the information system. In addition, the central and local NSIH offices were endowed
with equipment (computers, printers, copies and fax machines) that constituted the initial
material basis for proceeding with the implementation of the individual accounts.




                                               14

In summary, the project contributed to the institutionalization of the SPU in the MLSPF
and the establishment of better management and accountability in the NSIH. Capacity to
analyze social policy issues was developed, although due to low remuneration, the
ministry is currently faced with the problem of retaining qualified staff.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

(None)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(Not applicable)

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

The risk to development outcome is rated substantial based on the following:

  i.   The pension policy reversal, which resulted in putting a hold on the retirement
       age increase in 2001 and the several revisions of the pension formula. The
       pension reform package agreed and approved in 1998 included elimination of a
       range of pension privileges. On a positive note, however, signs of progress in
       pension policy reform had resumed by 2005. The Bank continues with dialogue
       with the counterparts on furthering the pension reform.

  ii.  Long term financial sustainability of the pension system. The recent PER
       (2007) notes that the short-term financial position of the NSIH system is not
       alarming. The NSIH reported reserves of about 1.6 percent of GDP and that the
       pension system relied very little on State Budget transfers. In addition, the
       Government strategy to unify the contributory system is expected to increase
       revenues in the medium-term. However, the pension system's long term financial
       sustainability faces risks: as the dependency ratios deteriorate, the long term
       financial viability of the system will depend on how well the reserves are
       managed and secured for the next generation. Critical to this will be the extent to
       which NSIH funds are not mismanaged.

 iii.  Limited capacity in policy analysis, monitoring and evaluation on social
       protection issues within the ministry. Part of the problem is the staff turnover due
       low remuneration.

  Recent discussions on the economic growth and poverty reduction as well as public
  expenditure review in Moldova have identified the above problems as threats to the
  sustainability of the pension system and in general, social protection. The Poverty
  Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 3) provides critical support to build on the
  achievements made under the project. It is supporting: (i) the establishment of the
  individual accounts for 100 percent of all pension contributors; (ii) implementation of
  the pension reform strategy to unify the pension system for all types of pensioners


                                            15

  (non-agricultural, agricultural and privileged); and (iii) making progress in linking
  benefits to contributions. The PRSC also plans to monitor progress in increasing the
  effectiveness of social assistance expenditures in reaching the poor.

  The Board has approved a follow-up project "Health Services and Social Assistance
  Project" (outlined above), which is expected to support the Government's social
  protection programs by increasing equity in access to quality and efficient health and
  social assistance services.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(Relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is satisfactory based on: (i) the consistency
of the PDO with the priorities identified by the Government, and the CAS (1999); (ii) the
analytical work underpinning the project; (iii) the Bank's role in coordinating with other
donors such as DfiD on the implementation of the project; (iv) the adequacy of the
project design; and (v) participatory processes that fostered ownership mechanisms for
the project.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

The project was regularly supervised by Bank Specialists in social protection, pension,
and financial management during its implementation. The supervision teams identified
the risks to meeting development objectives and engaged in constructive dialogue with
the counterparts to discuss possible mitigation measures. A mid-term review was
conducted in March 2003 to assess the progress toward meeting the PDO and in addition,
the Bank supervision reports and Aide Memoires were filed into IRIS. These documents
demonstrate that there was continuous feedback between the Bank supervision team and
the Government.

The supervision team followed the original results framework and reported the indicators
regularly. However, the ICR notes that the supervision team could have improved upon
the M & E framework by eliminating the duplication between outcome and output
indicators. Considering the overall performance of the Bank supervision team, the ICR
rates the quality of supervision as satisfactory.




                                              16

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

In view of the rating for the quality at entry, lending, and supervision, the overall Bank
performance is rated as satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

During project preparation and appraisal, the counterparts showed a high level of
commitment and leadership. There was a close cooperation between the Government and
the Bank during implementation of the project. The Government made commendable
progress in developing the farmer's pension strategy taking into consideration the Bank
team's recommendations. Also, in terms of counterpart funding, the Government
contributions to the project were paid from the Treasury at the MOF to beneficiaries
based on supporting documents prepared by the PCU. No delays were reported in terms
of counterpart funding.

The main issue was the policy reversal with respect to pension reform which took place
in 2001. This entailed the reversals on some pension privileges and the adoption of
"freezing" the increase of retirement age for certain category of population. Given the
importance of this policy reversal, the rating of the Government on the overall
implementation of pension reform is moderately satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

Ministry of Social Protection and Health. Despite the organizational changes that
resulted in the merger of the health and social protection ministries, the ministry officials
worked closely with the Bank to ensure that the project is implemented as planned. The
presence of the SPU and the CU in the ministry was instrumental in aiding the
coordination between the Government, the Bank and other donors.

National Social Insurance House. Despite the disruptions due to the changes in NSIH
management that occurred during the implementation of the NSIH, the NSIH
management was committed to implementation of the project. They were heavily
involved in the piloting and rolling out the IT system and its modules on calculating
pensions. However, there were delays in implementing the IT system that resulted in
extension of the project's completion date.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Overall, the Borrower's performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory


                                             17

6. Lessons Learned

This project provides the following lessons:

Project specific lessons

   i.  Establishment of realistic and clear M & E arrangements is important for the
       achievement of the project's objectives. This operation showed the need to
       establish clear project indicators against which to monitor and evaluate the
       project's outcomes. In addition, the indicators to be monitored and evaluated must
       reflect the entire project development objective. Ensuring that the indicators do
       not overlap and that they measurable is a key lesson that future operations on
       pension and social protection will need to take into account.

  ii.  Strong reliance on sound analytical basis for designing effective operations in
       social protection is important. This operation was underpinned by the Bank's
       ESW and intensive dialogue with the Borrower, which contributed to a better
       understanding of social protection issues in Moldova.

 iii.  Improving the awareness of the general public about their rights and
       responsibilities in the pension system. The roles of the CU and the NSIH in
       pension information dissemination during this operation was crucial toward
       meeting the project development objective. Survey evidence showed that between
       2001 and 2004, there was improvement in knowledge among the public regarding
       their awareness of factors determining pensions.

General lessons

   i.  It is essential to maintain commitment to pension policy reform. Implementation
       of a similar operation on pensions and/or social protection will require a better
       understanding of the institutional environment in which the project is to be
       implemented.

  ii. Implementation of similar projects requires improving the capacity of the
      implementing agencies to analyze social protection policy issues.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component I: Improving analytical capacity, monitoring and evaluation (Actual
Total Cost: US$ 0.58 million)

Overall rating: Satisfactory. The main output under this component was the creation
and institutionalization of the SPU. The unit has strengthened social policy analysis in the
ministry. The outputs of the unit include the publication of the Annual Social Reports
(ASR) since 2000 at the expense of the state budget. The quality of these reports has
improved over time as evident from the production of analytical tables and figures
constructed using data from the NSIH, HBS, Government and World Bank Reports. The
ASRs discuss the progress on the implementation of the broader social protection issues,
identify the challenges to the reforms and propose specific recommendations on
addressing the problems. The ASRs are widely disseminated to the parliament, ministries,
donors, NGOs, local levels, and the general public. The process of producing the ASRs
has strengthened the coordination of social policy issues across ministries (e.g., MOF,
Ministry of Labor [MOL]) and the statistical office.

In addition to the ASRs, the unit has contributed to the preparation of the social policy
chapters of the EGPRSP and the Mid-Term Expenditure Framework.

Training of the staff (in the ministry and the SPU) is another output that the project
strived to achieve. For example, staff were trained to produce improved business
processes by a training firm known as PE International. However, there are challenges in
sustaining the accomplishments of this component. At the end of the project the ministry
was faced with the problem of limited number of staff with technical abilities in social
policy analysis, monitoring and evaluation on social protection issues

Component II: Social Protection Administration (Total cost US$ 10.9 million)

Overall rating: Satisfactory. The outputs include: (i) improved NSIH capacity to
manage the pension system as well as administer the calculation and delivery of pensions
and benefits; (ii) improved accounting and budgeting practices; (iii) development of the
IT system to help administer the pension reform; and (iv) the elimination of pension
arrears and in-kind contributions, and building public awareness about the pension
system.

The project supported the re-organization of the MLSPF/NSIH administration structures
at all levels from national down to local office levels. In addition, it strengthened the
capacity to administer the calculation and delivery of pensions and benefits and
installation of IT.

For example, in 2003 a seminar was held to discuss the implications of the PROST model
on the pension system with a wide audience of stakeholders, ministries and development



                                            20

partners. However, given the shortcomings of the PROST model, participants called for
the construction for a national model for Moldova with the support of Bank funding.

As part of improving the analytical capacity of the staff, a group of NSIH specialists
(developers, users, managers) visited Greece to get familiar with the operation of the
information system.

The installation of the software and hardware for pension calculations was carried by a
Greek company, Intracom. The NSIH staff together with Intracom representatives tested
several modules of the pension system, including, the pensions, benefits, contributions,
register of economic agents, register of natural persons, client request log, medical
disabilities, financial management system, record of administrative expenditures, and the
budget modules. The process of testing the software responded to the clients' needs. The
process included the individual testing of each module, their interaction and testing of the
interfaces with the external entities such as Moldova Post Office, Banca de Economiii,
Savings Bank, and the STO. The process started by NSIH staff testing the software and
taking note of all the problems in using it. The contracted company responded to the
proposals and comments raised by the client.

The IT equipment was installed and software was tested at three pilot offices (local NSIH
offices). The ICR team visited Anenii Noi regional pension house and found the staff
applying the software as they had been trained; albeit with some difficulties with the
software application. In addition, we note that due to the complexity of the information
system, the development and testing of each module was delayed and was finalized in the
middle of November, 2006 against the deadline of July 2006. The IT system was
developed and currently functioning throughout the NSIH offices.

The establishment of a modern IT system has reduced the processing time for pension
payment, linked critical databases that support the monitoring process of the pension
system in Moldova. The NSIH has been able to open PIDs for over 95 percent of the
pensioners. Of these, 74 percent have been issued with personal accounts.

The NSIH financial and accounting systems have improved. For example, an audit of
project financial statements for 2005 indicated the auditors did not find considerable
deficiencies and gave an unqualified opinion on project financial matters. In 2004,
deficiencies were found by the auditors in the financial reporting. With the support of the
internal audit, the NSIH financial systems have been improved. The internal audit
controls the activity of the local NSIH offices, auditing of the accounts, distribution and
use of sanatorium tickets for veterans in some local NSIH offices. They also audit the
distribution of the NSIH monthly newspaper "the Social Insurance". In addition, the
communication about the financial audits of the NSIH has improved with regular
reporting to the Bank.

The NSIH now submits regularly the centralized information on payments and
calculations to the state social insurance budget required for the tax office activities. The
tax authorities use the report and find it useful. The coordination of activities between the



                                              21

NSIH and the tax authorities has improved (for example, the two institutions work
closely when they need to enforce payments of contributions from businesses).

The capacity of the NSIH was increased at central and local levels. The central and local
NSIH offices were endowed with equipment (computers, printers, copies and fax
machines) that constituted the initial material basis for proceeding with the
implementation of the individual accounts.

Component III: Public Information Provision and Communication (Total cost
US$ 0.53 million)

Overall rating: moderately satisfactory. The expected outputs included establishment
of a communications unit to develop regular communication channels in order to
communicate policy messages on behalf of the ministry; to convey necessary information
to the public regarding their rights and responsibility in the pension system; and
providing key administrative information to the management of various departments in
the ministry. The communications unit was established with parallel co-financing under
the DFID. During its existence, a communications strategy was developed, an Advisory
group on Publicity (including officials from the ministry, NSIH, the Independent
Journalism Center, and the DfiD office) was established in the ministry. Press coverage
of pension reform increased (e.g., a TV program was prepared and broadcasted) and
publicity leaflets were produced and distributed to all judets. Other accomplishments
included the training of journalists on social protection policies and at the same time
actively engaging them in writing and creating programmes about social protection. A
resource center accessible to the journalists and the public was established within the
ministry. "Probably" as a result of increased public awareness, the personal contributions
to the state pensions rose from 1,005 million MDL in 2000, 1,275 million MDL in 2001,
1,602 million MDL in 2002, to 1,785 million MDL in 2003.

However, with the reorganization that led to the merger of the Ministry of Health with the
Ministry of Social Protection and Family, the CU disappeared from the new ministry's
organizational structure. By the end of 2006, the two ministries had been split again and
it was unclear whether the unit would resurrect again. The disappearance of the CU
pointed to the problem of lack of commitment from the ministry to allocate staff to the
unit. Despite the efforts toward institutionalization of the unit in the ministry (e.g., the
creation of information center (formally, the library), the restructuring of the ministry was
a major setback for the sustainability of this unit's and the failure to institutionalize the
unit within the structure of the ministry.

On a positive note, however, the NSIH houses a communications section that provides
public awareness by disseminating a monthly news letter known as the "Social
insurance" published in Romanian and Russian Languages. The NSIH distributes nearly
10,000 copies of the news letter to local levels, public places, ministries, parliament, civil
society including employers' associations and trade unions.

Component IV: Coordination component (Total cost US$ 0.54 million)
Overall rating: Satisfactory. The main outcome was to encourage greater integration of
the project in the daily business of the ministry. This output has been achieved as evident
from the ISR ratings and the responses during the ICR mission. This unit has been central
in coordinating the project activities. The PCU performed its procurement financial
management functions well. The project audits were carried out regularly and all audit
reports were satisfactory.

The other outputs of the component included financing of operational expenses of the
PCU, including staff salaries, technical assistance, translations, project auditing and
consumables throughout the life of the project. The audit of the financing of operational
expenses conducted by the World Bank show that the SPU unit implemented the required
financial and accounting practices.

Background and objectives

The Social Protection Management Project became effective in October 1999 with
financial support from the World Bank (IDA) through provision of a credit in the amount
of 8.2 SDR (about USD 11.1 million) and a Grant in the amount of USD 571,500. The
project was closed on March 31, 2007. The funds were provided with the objective of
strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP) (later,
Ministry of Health and Social Protection - MHSP) and of the National Social Insurance
House (NSIH) to implement the pension reform.

2. Evaluation of Project Implementation

2. 1. Evaluation of project activities financed from Credit nr.3261-MD

To achieve the PDO, the project supported the development of a coherent framework for
social protection policy development through the establishment of a social policy unit
within the MLSP and by strengthening the social policy monitoring and evaluation
system. The project also aimed at strengthening the NSIH in terms of its organizational,
human resource, financial management capacity and through the development of the
information technology systems.

The project had four components namely:

Component 1  Social Protection Policy Analysis, Monitoring and Evaluation;

Component 2  Social Protection Administration;

Component 3  Public Information Provision and Communication; and

Component 4  Project Coordination

Component 1 - Social Protection Policy Analysis, Monitoring and Evaluation

This component aimed at strengthening the capacity of the MLSP to develop and monitor
social protection policies. The component focused on implementing the following main
activities: a) establishment and development of the Social Policy Unit (SPU); b)
strengthening SPU capacity through training; c) preparation of the Annual Social
Reports; and d) monitoring the implementation of the pension reform.

Results

The following results were achieved by March 31 2005 (the original closing date of the
project):

Establishment and development of the Social Policy Unit
The SPU was set up by the end of 1999. It was composed of three staff from the
Directorate for Social Insurance of the MLSP. The staff were provided the necessary
equipment and resources to carry out their activity. As of November 21, 2002, the social
policy unit was institutionalized as part of the MLSP through Government Order #1516
as the Division for Monitoring and Evaluation of Social Protection Policy.

Strengthening capacity through training
The main training program was implemented during 2001-2002. During this period the
French consulting company ,Sofreco' designed a program and trained the social policy
unit staff as well as other staff from the MLSP. The training focused on social policy in
developed countries, on economic aspects of social protection policies and their impact



                                            30

on the reforms as well as on the social protection issues faced by countries in transition.
Training was provided on main indicators for evaluation of social protection policies, on
specific methods for reform analysis as well as the macro and microeconomic
performance of the reforms. Staff were introduced to the main concepts and indicators of
poverty, main anti-poverty policies as well as ways to fight poverty in transition countries.
In parallel, the staff of the SPU participated in various seminars and conferences
organized in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. Capacity was
strengthened also through work with individual consultants that were employed in
various SP sub-sectors.

Preparation of the Annual Social Report (ASR)
The first ASR which represents an overview of social protection issues and outlines
possible solutions was developed and printed in 2001. Later, such reports were prepared
each year. The first two reports were prepared with the assistance of international
consultants. Starting with 2003, the report has been mainly prepared by ministerial staff.
Initially, the development of the report was financed by project funds, but starting with
2005, the financing is done by the state.

Monitoring of pension reform implementation
The SPU constantly monitors the implementation of the pension reform. When required,
the SPU does the necessary calculations related to pension legislation amendments. The
project hired an international company that designed the long-term pension model.

The SPU was institutionalized within the ministry as a separate unit. Its staff continue to
monitor social protection policies and the results of this work are included in the ASRs.
As mentioned earlier, two such reports were produced with budget funds.

Component 2  Social Protection Administration

This component aimed at strengthening the capacity of the NSIH through the
development of a more efficient organization structure and functional responsibilities,
development of a human resources plan, strengthening of the financial management
system and development of the IT system.

The activities within the component were divided into two sub-components: (i)
strengthening administrative capacity, and (ii) developing information technology.

Subcomponent 2.1  Strengthening administrative capacity

This subcomponent focused on implementing the following activities: (i) development of
a new organizational structure; (ii) development of a working plan for the new
administration of social protection; (iii) risk management, quality control and fraud
prevention; (iv) improvement of the financial management system and accounting
practices; and (v) staff training.




                                            31

Results
An international company, PE-International was selected to help the NSIH in
implementing the activities within this sub-component during 2001, 2002 and first
quarter of 2003.

Development of a new organizational structure
With assistance of PE international the new NSIH organization structure was designed.
The new structure included the following organizations: Pension Department, Social
Fund and the Computer Center from the former Ministry of Labor and Social Protection,
and the Medical Expertise Committee from the former Ministry of Health. The
integration that lasted about nine months ended in 2001.Inn parallel, a model of a local
NSIH office was designed.

Development of a working plan for the new administration of social protection
With the assistance of PE international, the first strategic working plan of the NSIH was
developed covering 2003-2005. The plan was approved by the Administrative Council of
the NSIH and then was implemented. Every year, the NSIH develops and implements a
working plan.

Risk management, quality control and fraud prevention
PE International helped identify the risks of the social insurance system and developed a
plan of corresponding measures to manage those risks. The internal audit department,
created within the new NSIH structure, is responsible for risk management, control, fraud
detection and prevention.

Improvement of the financial management system and accounting practices
As a follow up to the first external audit of the NSIH (done by PricewaterhouseCoopers)
and based on their recommendations to PE International, a new accounting plan was
designed. A new accounting manual and a supplementary guide concerning the auxiliary
documentation necessary for accounting purposes were prepared. All the documents were
designed in accordance with the requirement of international accounting standards which
were introduced within NSIH starting with 2002. Since then, the NSIH was exposed to
external auditing each year. The implementation of the recommendations proposed by
auditors helped improve the financial management and accounting systems of the NSIH.

Staff training
With the assistance of PE International, a staff training plan for NSIH was put in place.
Once the heads of local NSIH offices were appointed, they received training pertaining to
management, strategic planning, and implementation of individual accounts. The staff of
the internal audit department received training in control management, risk identification
and prevention, and fraud prevention in the pension system. Accountants benefited from
training in use of international accounting standards. Several study tours were organized
to various countries during which the staff of the NSIH learnt about the operation of
similar social protection systems in the respective countries. This also contributed to the
strengthening of the staff capacity.




                                             32

Sustainability of activities
There is continuity of the activities (development of action plans, risk management and
fraud prevention, improvements in the financial management system and accounting
practices) under this subcomponent. More important, these activities paid for from the
social insurance budget as administrative expenditures. The only activity that would
require additional financing would be the external audit of the NSIH.

Subcomponent 2.2  Developing information technology
Two activities were expected to be implemented under the subcomponent: a) the
development of an information technology system (IT) and b) staff training regarding the
new system and applications.

Results

Design of the IT system
The design and implementation of an IT system represented one of the most important
objectives of the project. This activity covered about 60 percent of the total project cost.

In 2001, computers, copier machines, fax machines and modems were procured for
central and local offices to help initiate the operation of the then created NSIH. This
equipment represented the minimum necessary to start the organization of the individual
accounts system. The development of the new IT system started with developing a
strategy and IT architecture within the NSIH, description of technical requirements and
specifications of the new system and the preparation of the bidding documentation. These
activities were carried out with the assistance of a consulting company from Russia and
were finalized in august 2003.

After the bidding on design and implementation of the new IT system was organized, the
contract was signed in April 2005 with the winner, the Greek company Intracom. The
implementation of the contract lasted 24 months and ended on March 31, 2007.

The IT system developed under the component is rather complex and includes a number
of modules: pensions, benefits, social insurance contributions, register of economic
entities and physical persons, evidence of client claims, medical expertise, financial
management system, management information system, social insurance budget
development and accounting of administrative expenses. The program contains several
interfaces with Posta Moldovei, Banca de Economiii, Tax Office and others.

All local offices were prepared for installation of new equipment, i.e. they were
renovated, cabled and networked to permit the operation of the new system and
equipment.

By the end of March 2007, the equipment and software (initially tested in three local
offices) were installed throughout the country. However, taking into account the
complexity of the system, the NSIH decided to keep testing the program for 4-6 months




                                             33

before the final transition to the new system (expected to begin in September or October
2007).

Training of staff on new programs and applications
In order to train the staff of the central office of the NSIH, a special room was renovated
and equipped. During October 1, 2005 and March 31, 2007, the IT specialists from the
NSIH benefited from a training program covering the platform of the application,
language and tools of software development, management of the IT system.

The users of the new system also benefited from training. About 80 users were trained in
using all the modules of the system. In turn, these users trained staff from the local
offices.

Sustainability of activities

In accordance with the terms of the contract regarding the development and installation
of the IT system, Intracom will, for a period of three years, ensure the warranty of the
equipment and of the software. Following that period, NSIH will maintain the system
with own funds.

Component 3  Public Information Provision and Communication

This component had the objective of improving communication and public information
concerning social protection policies. The component focused on implementing the
following activities: (i) establishment of a communication unit; (ii) development of a
communication strategy; (iii) organization of a public opinion survey and (iv) the
development of information materials.

The implementation of the component ended on March 31, 2005.

Results

Establishment of a communication unit

The communication unit was set up just like other components by the end of 1999. The
required equipment for its operation was purchased and installed. The staff of the unit
were trained at the Independent Center for Journalism where they learnt interviewing
techniques, methods of communication with the general public, techniques for making
announcements and press conferences. International consultants trained unit staff how to
design informational brochures.

To make the unit operate more effectively, a local consultant was hired who provided
assistance in implementation of all activities.

The Division for Communication was created on the basis of the unit through
Government Order # 1516 as of November 21, 2002.



                                               34

Public opinion survey
Two public opinion surveys were carried out by the Center for Public Opinion and
Market Research from Bucharest (Romania) on the implementation of the new pension
system: one in April 2001 and the other in May 2004. The results of the survey carried
out in 2004 showed that the knowledge of the general public about the pension system
improved compared to 2001.

Development of the communication strategy
Based on the results of the first survey, a draft communication strategy was developed
which was approved by the MLSP by the end of 2001. The strategy represented a number
of steps to improve public awareness about the pension system.

Preparation of information materials
A number of bilingual informational brochures were developed, edited and distributed on
the current social insurance system, brochures for males and females who worked in
hazardous industries, for females with many children, for disabled and for employers.

Four radio broadcasts were organized informing the public about the importance of
paying social insurance contributions in order to obtain a future pension. Three TV
adverts were developed and televised on the same topic.

Several contests were organized for specialized reporters on reflecting the pension theme,
You Can't Have a Pension if You Don't Contribute'. Many press, TV and radio reporters
participated in the contest. Press communiqus were issued regularly and monitoring of
the social protection articles in the press was done on a regular basis. The web page of the
communication unit was launched.

Sustainability of Activities

Regretfully, after the merger of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection (in April
2005) the Communication Division was disbanded and the staff laid off.

Component 4  Project Coordination

The objective of the component was to ensure that the project implements on time
through coordination and monitoring of all activities.

Results

Organizational issues
The coordination unit was created within the MLSP immediately with the launch of the
project in October 1999. The unit was composed of four people: Head of the unit,
Procurement specialist, Finance specialist and Administrative assistant. In accordance
with the ministerial order, the deputy minister responsible for social insurance was




                                              35

appointed as Project Director. The unit received necessary equipment and office space for
its operation. Its staff received training in procurement and disbursement.

Procurement
During project life, 85 procurements were organized (27 procurement of goods, 19 of
consulting services and 20 related to staff training). Eight procurements were organized
in the framework of grant implementation.

Disbursement
As of June 30, 2007, about USD 10.8 million were disbursed by the project, including
USD 10.1 million from Credit #3261-MD, USD 0.4 million from the Grant TF055807
and USD 0.3 million from Government contribution. Please see a more detailed
description of disbursements at the end of the report.
2. 2. Evaluation of implementation of activities financed from Grant TF 055807

As mentioned earlier, the objectives of the project for component 1 and 3 were reached
on March 31, 2005 and their financing from the Credit funds stopped. However, in order
to build on the results achieved, the World Bank provided the Ministry of Health and
Social Protection a grant in the amount of USD 571,500.

The objectives of the grant were to be reached through four components:

Component A ,,";
Component B ,,Monitoring the development of the IT system for the NSIH";
Component C ,,Assistance to the MHSP in implementation of the communication
strategy";
Component D ,,Grant Administration", which envisaged the audit of the Grant.


Component A  Assistance to the MHSP in development of pension and social
assistance policies

The component had the objective of reviewing the pension policies, identify drawbacks
and suggest solutions as well as provide the financial forecasts for the pension system.

Results

a) Developing the medium-term model to forecast the revenues and expenditures in
the pension system (3  5 years)
In order to enable better medium-term forecasts of revenues and expenditures and in
order to facilitate the development of the MTEF, the grant financed the development of a
forecasting model (3-5 years). The model can be used to forecast the financial stability of
the pension fund, evaluate its solvency, and determine the impact of indexation on
revenues and expenditures. Besides that, the model can be used to analyze the operational
impact of medium-term decisions.




                                               36

The model contains the following main modules:

  i.    The macroeconomic module which determines the salary level depending on
        macroeconomic assumptions and forecasts in the labor market;
  ii.   The demographic module which determines the total number of contributor
        groups and pensioners by age and gender;
 iii.   The revenue modules which is used to calculate the contributions for each group
        of contributors as well as to calculate the accumulated entitlements; and
 iv.    The expenditure module which calculates the level of the pensions paid and the
        total amounts by pensioner group and pension type.

The mentioned modules are formed of standard functional elements characteristic for this
type of forecasting models. At the same time, the model is rather flexible given the
presence of a regulation module which allows the change in the model parameters.

The model is based on Excel using VBA which allows ease of use by a large number of
users. The model was presented to the staff of the Ministry and NSIH during a workshop
at the ministry with participation of World Bank experts. The technical description of the
model as well as a user's guide was also presented during the workshop. Several staff of
the ministry was trained to use the model.

b) Review of pension legislation
A review of the current pension legislation was carried out by an international and local
consultant. A report which presents the current situation as well as a number of future
scenarios based on the long-term model was prepared and presented to the ministry. The
report contains several chapters, including the pension legislation, demographic situation,
macroeconomic situation, actuarial review and the results of the modeling.
The international expert also presented the risks of the funded system as well as the risks
of the notionally funded system from the point of view of the system participants:
employers, employees, the state. He also showed how this type of systems can be used
while reforming the pension system of Moldova. Both reports were translated in
Romanian and English (the original was in Russian) and published.

It is to be mentioned that a web page was launched when implementing this task
(http://pension.md), which contains information concerning the development of the
pension system and namely: all the reports on the pension system, all the annual social
reports, the presentations and descriptions of the models developed as well as various
legislative acts.

c) The review of the social protection system for the disabled
The analysis of the social protection system for the disabled was carried out by an
international and a local consultant. As a result of the analysis, three reports were
prepared which contain the definitions of disability (legal definition based on the medical



                                              37

condition and the functional definition linked to the ability to carry out activities), a vast
analysis of the legal and institutional framework for the social protection of disabled
individuals, the financial analysis of the system as well as a number of recommendations
pertaining to the future development of the system.

The reports were prepared and published in three languages: Romanian, Russian and
English and were officially presented during a seminar on April 27, 2007 with the
participation of representatives from the Presidency, Government and NGOs.

d) Review of the gender aspect of the pension system
The international and local consultant carried out an analysis of the pension legislation in
terms of gender aspect. The report contains a chapter that describes the gender aspect of
the pension system in different countries, several chapters that describe the Moldovan
legislation and an analysis of the gender aspect from a demographic point of view, the
influence of the labor market on the directions of the pension system reform taking into
account the gender aspect, the migration, the shadow economy as well as the gender
problems that confront current pensioners.

Different long-term scenarios for the pension system development from a gender aspect
were looked at in the report. The report contains a number of calculations concerning the
dynamics of the gender differences on pension amounts, an analysis of the old and new
pension formula from a longer-term perspective.
The current reports as well as other reports prepared with grant financing were published
in three languages: Romanian, Russian and English and were officially presented during
a seminar at the Ministry.

Component B  Monitoring the development of the IT system for the NSIH

The objective of the component was to provide assistance to the NSIH in the
management and implementation of the IT contract (a contract in the amount of USD 6
million carried out by the Intracom). Two consultants were hired (one expert in technical
issues and one expert in management issues) to help implement the IT contract.

Results

Assistance to the NSIH in the implementation of the contract with Intracom (IT
specialist)
The IT consultant was practically always present on the ground providing assistance to
the contract manager from the NSIH. The consultant provided assistance on the ways of
testing the IT system during the pilot phase, on the establishment of the Data Center, on
better data migration from the old system to the new system, on the evaluation of
standard informational packages Oracle, on ways to manage the applications. The
consultant participated in the evaluation of the training program for end users as well as
for managers of the applications system (database administrators, operational systems,
network equipment etc.). He participated in the testing of the equipment, analyzed the
authorization subsystems which allow the access to the informational system, participated



                                             38

in negotiations with representatives of Mold telecom on the establishment of a corporate
distribution network.

Assistance to the NSIH in the implementation of the contract with Intracom
(management specialist)
The international expert provided assistance to the NSIH in developing the
implementation plan of the IT contract, in its monitoring, in identifying possible risks and
offering solutions together with the representatives of the contractor and the NSIH.
Regretfully, having obtained a full-time position with the EBRD, the consultant had to
stop his cooperation with the NSIH. Given the importance of the IT contract, the
management of the NSIH hired another consultant to help with the task.

Component C  Assistance to the MHSP in the implementation of the
communication strategy

The component had the objective of continuing the provision of assistance to the MHSP
in strengthening its communication capacity.

Results

Given the merger of two ministries into a MHSP, the communication unit was disbanded
and the staff laid off. The ministry management decided not to initiate any activity in this
component of the grant given the lack of staff and limited implementation time.
Component D  Grant Administration

This component envisaged the organization of the financial audit of Grant TF 055807.
Results

The audit of the grant was carried out simultaneously with the audit of Credit nr.3261-
MD by the audit company Deloitte & Touch. The audit was financed from the credit
funds based on an amendment of the contract with the auditor.

4. Evaluation of the project impact on the objectives envisaged in the EGPRSP

The objectives formulated in the ,Social Insurance' chapter of the Strategy for Economic
Growth and Poverty Reduction referred to the elimination of drawbacks in the social
insurance system, assurance of the link between the financial stability of the social
insurance system, contributions and benefits and improvement of the payments
calculation.

The activities implemented during the SPM project had a positive impact on the
achievement of the objectives envisaged in the EGPRSP. It is worth mentioning the
following:



                                                  42

(i)    Analysis of implementation of social protection

Ministry staff regularly analyzes social protection policies, identify drawbacks and risks
in the system and put forward proposals to improve the social protection legislation.
(Before 2004 this activity was carried out with assistance of international and local
consultants). The results of this analysis are reflected in the annual social reports of the
Ministry which have been published since 2001 with funding from the SPM project and
with budget funding since 2005.

An analysis of the current pension legislation from a gender and disability was carried out
by international and local consultants by the end of 2006 and start of 2007. This analysis
should form the basis for improvement of the current social insurance system.

(ii)   Improvement of the administration of the social insurance system through
       the development of an integrated IT system

The most important contract in the SPM project was the contract to develop and install
the integrated IT system for the National Social Insurance House. The contract was
finalized on March 31, 2007. All the main processes in the administration of the social
insurance system were automated, including contribution collection to the social
insurance budget, the determination and pension payment. This automation will make the
administration of the social insurance system more efficient.

(iii)  Implementation of the practice of forecasting revenues and expenditures in
       the pension system

Two forecasting models were developed under the project: one long-term and one
medium-term. Macroeconomic and demographic factors are used to make the forecasts.
The implementation of this practice allows a better use of the funds available in the
pension system.
