                         With less than three months remaining for implementation, the project has demonstrated accomplishments in terms of achieving the PDO and all component intermediate results
                         and indicators, including food crop production (rice, maize and potato) and improvements in rural infrastructure (improvements in irrigation canals and rural roads). Overall the project
                         has made a tremendous social and economic impact on the livelihoods of the beneficiaries. The road and irrigation intervention has benefited over 8273 Households (HH) and the

                         The project contributed to the construction of 95.5 km of farm roads, 107.7 km of power tiller trails, and 3 Baily bridges. The project completed 450.6 km of rehabilitation works and
                         constructed 44.3 km of new irrigation channels. The project has also contributed to enhancing agricultural productivities of major crops such as rice, maize, potato through double
                         cropping, provision of quality seeds, extension services, rehabilitation of irrigation schemes and post-harvest support. Double cropping of rice in Bajo (30 acres) and Dagana (6 acres)

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         With the project coming to an end in less than two months i.e. December 2014, the Project Management Team (PMT) is giving utmost priority to timely completion of outstanding
                         activities. In addition, sustainability aspects for the project activities, beyond the project completion have also been discussed at length. The client has been recommended that in
                         order to ensure sustainability of the gains made, partnership opportunities with the private sector, seed producer groups and National Seed Center should be explored. The project
                         activities and processes (M&E, social and environment safeguards practices etc) are already well integrated within the RGoB’s institutional framework, therefore strengthening them
                         is also another way of further supporting sustainability. The commodity programs will need to tap production potential of rice, wheat and maize to mitigate food shortages and justify
                         the investment in agriculture and irrigation. The project can produce manuals and guide on improved farming practices, organize end of project workshops to share the lessons and
                         explore opportunities for business development and collaboration.

                         An assessment survey is planned to be commissioned starting October 20th 2014 in order to record the exact project impact on the ground. The details of the impact assessment
                         report (that includes a brief economic analysis and beneficiary survey report) shall feed into the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) that would be due fairly soon
                         after the project ends. Also, compilation and collation of data and information that will support the preparation of Implementation Completion Report, was also recommended.
