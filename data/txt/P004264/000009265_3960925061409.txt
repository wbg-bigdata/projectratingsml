PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MAIAYSIA
ROMPIN ENDAU AREA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LDAN 1957-MA)
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Rompin Endau Area
Development Project, for which Loan 1957-NA was approved on October 15, 1981,
in the amount of US$ 40.0 million. Due to changes in national rice production
policy and problems of project sustainability, implementation was stopped in
early 1986 and the loan closed on October 1, 1987, with cancellation of
US$ 21.1 million.
The PCR (Project Termination Report) was prepared by the Ministry of
Agriculture, based on a review of the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR No.
3160-MA, dated February 20, 1981) and other official documents.  An Overview
prepared by the staff of the Asia Region was sent to the Government for
comment on September 24, 1987. Comments received on November 5, 1987 are
reflected in the report, and reproduced in the Annex.
The project has not been subject to an audit by the Operations
Evaluation Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALAYSIA
ROMPIN ENDAU AREA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1957 MA)
EVALUATION      Y
Introduction
The project area was designated during the Third Malaysia Plan (1976-
1980) as one of the granary areas which would contribute to the Government's
policy of rice self-sufficiency. Feasibility studies were prepared by a
consortium of local and foreign consultants engaged by the Government's
Economic Plannir.g Unit (EPU).
Obiectives
The R pin Endau Area Development Project aimed at land clearing and
irrigation deve'- pment of 11,400 ha of tropical forest land  for rice
production and settlement of 4,750 settler families in the State of Pahang,
Peninsular Malaysia. The project was to be implemented in six years (1981-
1987) by the Ministry of Agriculture, at an estimated cost of US$ 141.0
million.
TLWlementation Exoerience
Implementation, which be',gan in mid-1981, was affected by slow Forest
Department releases, adverse wea.her and lack of final engineering designs.
In 1984, due to these delays, increasing implementation difficulties and
budgetary constraints, the project scope was reduced to development of 4,370
ha for 880 settler families, and estimated project costs were reduced to
US$67.8 million. An outstanding feature during implementation was the partial
collapse of a small diversion dam due to soil foundation problems. A 1985
project review showed that, with the fall in international rice prices, high
development costs and difficult farming conditions, economic returns on
incremental irrigation investments would be negligible and that, even after
doubling farm size, farmer incomes would remain near the poverty line. During
early project trials, it was determined that intensive rice cultivation under
double cropping and mechanization would be very difficult given high rainfall
and soil conditions. This, and the decision to reduce national rice
production goals, prompted the Government to stop construction of project
irrigation works in early 1986.

Results
At the time of loan cancellation, about 6,500 ha of jungle had been
cleared, and administrative buildlngs and staff housing, a storage and a
diversion dam and a weir, and irrigation works for 300 ha had been completed.
Village settlement works and settler houses, and irrigation works for another
1,800 ha were in different stages of construction. Office equipLziat, vehicles
and farm machinery had also been purchased.  Total project expenditures were
US$35.4 M (M$84.5 M), of which: 20% for jungle land clearing and main drains;
30% dams; 16% irrigation canals and some tertiary development; 13%
administrative buildings, staff houses, and village settlement works and
settler houses; 13% engineering and supervision services; and 8%
administration, equipment and land acquisition.
Expected Benefits
Since project benefits from the main infrastructure works will not be
realized, the project ERR will be negative. However, limited benefits are
expected from other uses. Secondary jungle is rapidly covering cleared areas,
but it is expected that they will eventually be planted to oil palm, subject
to development of a drainage and road network. Administrative buildings,
access and village roads, settler houses and equipment have or will be put to
productive use; the dams and weir will have limited use for rural water
supply, but unfinished irrigation works and expenditures in engineering
designs are worthless.
Findings and Lessons
(1) Technical, social and economic sustainability should be of
primary concern in project planning and design, and this should be constantly
reviewed during implementation.
(2) While development of traditional settlement or irrigation
projects has proven successful in Malaysia and elsewhere, projects involving
both settlement and irrigation start.ing from virgin jungle are complex,
expensive and risky. Future Bank involvement in this type of project, if any,
should be carefully considered.
(3) Appropriate balance between enginieering, agricultural and other
disciplines must be maintained during project preparation, appraisal and
supervision.
(4) Bank guidelines on dam safety should be strictly enforced,
regardless of dam size. Detailed Terms of Reference and inspection timetables
for the Panel of Specialists should be agreed during negotiations or early
during implementation, and should be monitored closely.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALAYSIA
ROMPIN ENDAU AREA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LOAN 1957-MA
OVERVI
Introdtuct ion
1.       The Rompin Endau Area Development Project was financed under
Loan 1957-MA, approved in 1981.  The Project aimed at irrigation development
of 11,400 ha for rice production and settlement of 4,750 settler families, in
four independent subprojects (see Basic Data Sheet and IBRD Map 15104
attached).  Feasibility studies were carried ou.t by a consortium of foreign
and local consulting firms. Total cost at appraisal was estimated at US$141.0
million, with Bank financing of US$40.0 million. Implementation began in
mid-1981 and was affected by slow Forest Department releases, adverse weather
and lack of final engineering designs.  In 1984 the project scope was reduced
under a Special Action Program (SAP) to 4,370 ha for 880 settler families,  ind
estimated project costs were reduced to US$67.8 million.  Due to changes in
the official rice self-sufficiency policy and problems of project
sustainability, implementation was stopped in early 1986, and the US$21.1
million balance of the loan was cancelled on October 1, 1986.  The attached
February 1987 "Project Termination Report' (PCR), prepared by the Ministry of
Agriculture, adequately reflects project background and principal
implementation features.  The following are  highlights and additional
comments.
Poliect Concept
2.       Low current and projected international rice prices notwithstanding,
project failure was, to a major extent, due to a flawed concept. The project
was intended to develop a modern irrigation and settlement scheme for padi
cultivation in a virgin jungle swamp area which has a well distributed
3,500 mm mean annual rainfall, organic clay and peat soils.  Project works
included administrative buildings and staff housing, jungle clearing, dams,
irrigation and farm works, and settler villages.  Costs per hectare
(US$12,400) and per family (US$29,700) were therefore high (see PCR Background
and Project Formulation Chapters).
.4
3.       This project differs from other successful irrigation projects in
Malaysia, e.g. Muda, North West Selangor, Krian Sungei Manik, and most of the
Bang's traditional irrigation projects, which usually involve upgrading of
;           existing works or provision of new facilities for long established farming

communities. Rompin Endau was unusual in this regard, in that supplementary
irrigation was hardly necessaryl given rainfall and soil conditions in the
project area. With hindsight, the short dry periods and soil conditions
would have made double cropping and mechanization very difficult, as
demonstrated during early project trials. During the feasibility study it was
determined that establishment of cil palm with drainage a-id flood protection
was economically more attractive than rice cultivation (see Project Brief,
August 1979). However, as the Government war very concerned about rice self
sufficiency at that time it was decided, and the Bank agreed, to develop the
project area es one of the country's granary areas.
Project Implementation and Changes
4.       Slow release of forest lands, adverse weather and soil conditions and
lack of final designs slowed project implementation from the beginning (PCR
Section 5.1.2). Final engineering designs could only be carried out after
land clearing, which in turn was delayed by slow forest releases due to low
i            timber prices.  Higher than expected peat and acid sulfate soil areas led to
changes in canal alignments, resulting in a 30% reduction of potential crop
area (PCR 5.1.1.3). Heavy rains were also a reason for project delays (PCR
5.1.2.1 and 5.1.2.3).
5.       In 1984, due to slow progress, increasing implementation difficulties
and budgetary constraints, GOM agreed to scale down the project from 11,400 ha
to 4,370 ha. The Bank in turn agreed to maintain the original loan amount,
double the farm size to 4.8 ha (See PCR 3.1 to 3.3), and increase the civil
works disbursement percentage from 24% to 60% until June 30, 1985, reducing it
to 30% after that date.
6.       A 1985 project review showed that, with the fall in international
rice prices and increased construction costs, economic returns on incremental
irrigation investments would be marginal and that, even after doubling farm
size, farmer incomes would remain near the poverty line. This, and the
decision to reduce national rice production targets, prompted the Government
to stop construction of project irrigation works. The Bank then agreed to
consider supporting an alternative land development plan, primarily to ensure
prompt, efficient use of cleared lands under suitable crops. Oil palm was
selected by Government and DID prepared a drainage and roads plan to be
financed under the Loan. However, by July 1986 no agreement had been reached
between the Federal and Pahang State Governments on continuation of the
project, and the Federal Government therefore decided to cancel the
outstanding loan.
1/   The Government contends that supplementary irrigation is needed for the
major portion of the planting season.

7.       At the time of loan cancellation, about 6,500 ha of jungle clearing,
administrative buildings and staff housing, a storage and a diversion dam and
a weir, and irrigation works for 300 ha had been completed. Village settl,-
ment works and settler houses, and irrigation works for 1,800 ha were in
different stages of construction.  Office equipment, vehicles and farm
machinery had also been purchased.  Total project expenditures were US$35.4 H
(M$84.5 M), of which: 20% were for junglo land clearing and main drains; 30*
dams; 16% irrigation canals and some tertiary development; 13% administrative
buildings, staff houses, and village settlement works and settler houses; 13%
engineering and supervision services; and 8% administration, equipment and
land acquisition (PCR Appendices I and II).
Dam Collap
8.       Civil works construction quality was generally satisfactory.
However, a diversion dam partially collapsed shortly after completion, due to
soil foundation problems not sufficiently addressed during design and
construction. It is possible that, because of its size, insufficient atten-
tion was given to dam design.  The dam was rebuilt at GOM's expense, and
responsibility for the mishap is under discussion between GOM and the Project
Consultants.
9.       In accordance with the Loan Agreement, DID appointed a dam specialist
as an independent reviewer for Project dams. However, he was asked to review
only preliminary designs, without follow-up at final design and construction
stages. With hindsight, had he reviewed final designs and construction on a
periodic basis, the diversion dam collapse might have been avoided.
Project Beneiets
10.      Since project benefits from the main infrastructure works will not be
realized, the project ERR on expenditures will be negative. However, limited
benefits are expected from other uses.
11.      While secondary jungle is rapidly covering cleared areas, it is
expected that they will eventually be planted to oil palm, subject to develop-
ment of a drainage and road network. Additional investments in these works
and oil palm should yield reasonable economic returns. About 50% of the 300
ha with completed irrigation works in the Rompin Priority Area (PCR 4.5) are
under cultivation, and 31 families have settled there. However, returns from
rice production arc likely to be negative and will be a burden to the
Government. Eventually the area may have to be phased out of rice.
12.      Admipistrative buildings, access and village roads, settler houses
4           and equipment have or will be put to productive use; the dams and weir
con&tructed under the project will have limited use for rural water supply;
but unfinished irrigation works and expenditures in engineering designs are
worthless (PCR Section 4).

Performance of Consultants and Contractors
13.      Performance of the local and foreign consulting consortium respon-
sible for the project feasibility study, engineering designs and construction
supervision was less than satisfactory. Despite the feasibility study
findings (see paragraph 3 above) it was Government's decision to develop irri-
gated rice. However, in developing the project concept and agricultural deve-
lopment plans, the consultants overlooked the climatic and soil conditions
vis-a-vis sustainability of intensive agliculture and the need for, and high
cost of, irrigation infrastructure. Also, the collapse of ti.e Pontian
diversion dam was most likely due to design shortcomings' or less than
adequate construction supervision.
14.      Except for one contract, all land clearing, construction and supply
contracts were awarded to local contractors through ICB and LCB procedures in
accordance with Bank Guidelines. One contract was awarded to a local/foreign
contractors joint venture.  Two of three contracts awarded to a single
contractor were cancelled due to insolvency (PCR 5.1.2.4). Otherwise,
contractors' performance was generally satisfactory, including those which
were awarded more than one contract.
Bank Performance
15.      The Bank approved the project overlooking, like GOM and the consul-
tants, the largely unsuitable climatic and soil conditions for intensive rice
production under irrigation.  During preparation and appraisal, emphasis was
given to engineering aspects, rather than agricultural sustainability.  During
implementation, works construction was the primary activity but attention was
also given to agricultural aspects.  However, the Bank failed to insist on
adequate independent review procedures for dam design and construction. On
the other hand, the Bank played an important role in reducing the initial
project scope in 1984.
Lessons Learned
16.      (1)  Technical, social and economic sustainability should be of
primary concern in project planning and design, and this should be constantly
reviewed during implementation.
(2) While development of traditional settlement or irrigation
-           projects has proven successful in Malaysia 2/ and elsewhere, projects
involving both settlement and irrigation starting from virgin jungle are
;           complex, expensive and risky.  Future Bank involvement in this type of
project, if any, should be carefully considered.

Selangor Integrated Agricultural Development Project.

(3) Appropriate balance between engineering, agricultural and other
disciplines must be maintained during project preparation, appraisal and
supervision.
(4) Bank guidelines on dam safety should be strictly enforced,
regardless of dam size. Detailed Terms of Reference and inspection time-
tables for the Panel of Specialists should be agreed during negotiations or
early during implementation, and should be monitored closely.

ROIPIk-EUDAU AGRICULTURAL DEVHLOI14ZhT PROJECT
PROJECT TEMINATIOh REPORT
1. BACKGROUND
1.1.      The READP is located in the extreme south-east
of Pahang State in Peninsular Malaysia.   The area is
bounded by the Rompin River in the north and the Endau
River in the south.   It is mostly made up of a flat
coastal plain and large part of the area are swampy and
regularly inundated by the Rompin, Pontian, Anak Endau
and the Endau Rivers.   A major part of the area is
covered with jungle, mainly consisting of primary and
secondary forest and scrub.
1.2.      The project was conceptualised during the Third
Malaysia  Plan  (1976-1980), where  an extensive  J'ungle
region between the Rompin and the Endau Rivers in the
state of Pahang was identified as one cf the few
remaining areas in Peninsula Malaysia suitable for large-
scale paddy development. Subsequent investigation showed
that out of some 60,000 ha. in the area, about 16,000 ha.
might be suitable for irrigated rice cultivation.   To
allow further examination of the area's development
potential,  the hational Small-Scale  Irrigation Project
(Loan 1444-MA) provided financing for a feasibility
study.



-2-
1.3.      The  Economic  Planning  Unit  (EPU)  engaged
consultants   to   identify   and   examine   alternative
development strategies to prepare preliminary layouts and
designs of major structures for irrigation and drainage
systems of the proposed project.   The study was carried
out by Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (5MEC) of
Australia,   in  association  with  International  Land
Development Consultants  (ILACO) of the netherlands and
KPM Khidmat Sdn. Bhd. of Malaysia.  The study was guided
by the Steering Committee chaired by EPU and members were
representatives from relevant agencies.
1.4.      The first stage of the study, carried out in
April/May 1978 resulted in an Inception Report that
identified   about   8,600   ha.   suitable   for   rice
cultivation.  Since this area was less than anticipated,
the  Government  amended  the  consultant's  contract  to
include an additional 4,200 ha. north of the Rompin
River.   The final study report,  submitted in December
1979, identified a gross area of about 19,200 ha. of clay
and shallow peat soils suitable for rice cultivation.
The net irrigable area is about 11,400 ha. (12,700 ha.
gross) after eliminating areas with unsuitable location
or topography and deducting right-of-way for project
works.    Planning  for the agricultural,  fisheries and
livestock support services for the project was done by
the Ministry of Agriqulture (MOA).



-3
2. PROJECT FONIULAT ION
2.1.      The development of the READP was intended to
meet the national development objectives Of increased
income amd welfare of farm families, reducing dependence
on   rice   imports   through   new   land   development,
resettlement of landless and underemployed, provision of
irrigation and drainage facilities, provision of improved
*               agricultural management and services and establishment of
new settlements.
2.2.      To achieve the stated objectives, the appraisal
report outlined the main features of the project as
follows:
(a) land clearing on about 13,800 ha. of
swampy tropical forest;
(b)  construction of an earthfill dam on the
Anak Endau river, a cutoff channel and
ancillary works on the Rompin river, and
three weirs, one each on the Pontian, the
Anak Endau and Kembar rivers;
(c)  construction of about 110 km of main and
secondary canals, 130 km of drains, 95 km
of dikes, and 12 pumping stations;
(d)  construction  of 'tertiary  and  quaternary
canals and drains for a net irrigable area
of 11,400 ha;
(e)  construction  of  about  45  km  of  access
roads and about 150 km of farm roads;



-4-
(f) construction of two subregional centres
amd six farm settlements with physical and
social infrastructure for 4,750 settler
farm families;
(g)  construction  of office  buildings,  staff
quarters,     workshops,     stores      and
agricultural service facilities;
(h)  procurement  of  equipment,  vehicles  and
supplies   for   project   operation   and
maintenance and for agricultural support
services; and
(i)  consulting services  for detailed  design
and  construction  supervision of project
works.
2.3.      As  shown  in  Table  1,  the  project  area  is
geographically    divided    into    four    subprojects
corresponding to the four main rivers: Rompin, Pontian,
Anak Endau and Endau.
2.4.      The total project cost was estimated at ti$303.2
million and  implementation  was divided  into 2 phases
viz:   Phase I from 1981 to 1987 and Phase II from 1988
onwards  and  the  project  was -expected  to  be  fully
completed by the year 1994.   About M$86 million (US$40
million) or approximately 28% of the total cost was
financed by a World Bank Loan and the loan agreement



-5-
(Loan humber 1957 MA) was signed on May 6, 1981.   The
summary of the cost-estimates is shown in Table 2.

2.5.      The project appraisal report stated that, at
full  development,  about  4,750  families,  mainly  new
settlers or about 24,000 people would benefit directly
from the project.   Each family would be provided with a
j4               2.4 ha.  irrigated  rice land and 0.17 ha.  of housing
}1               lot.  They would also be provided with housing, community
a                infrastructure   and   agricultural   support   services.
However, certain amenities provided especially housing,
land and infrastructure development were expected to be
4                paid back partially by the farmers.

2.6.       In relation to marLagement the project consisted
of 6 major components i.e. Drainage ana Irrigation
Department (DID)., Pahang Tenggara Development Authority
(DARA),  Department  of  Agriculture  (DOA),          Farmers'
Organization Authority (FciA), bank Pertanian Malaysia
(BIl) and Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development
Institute  (IARDI).   Out of these six coiaponents,  only
DARA  is  under  the  Oiinistry  of  Lana  and  hegioUal
Development,  while the  rest are under tne ;inistry  uf
Agriculture.    Other  abencies  sucn  as  Lana  and  i!iines

3.REVIEW kNlD CHAhON IIi SCOPE
3.1.      Since its implementation in 1981, a number of
significant changes were made to the original project
scope.   The first change was on the basic concept of
farm-size.   In order to raise the income level of the
project beneficiaries above the poverty line, the Project
Steering Committee in its 7th meeting held on August 9,
1982 agreed to double the farm size per settler (family)
from 2.4 ha. to 4.8 ha. With the increase in farm size,
the number of project beneficiaries was accordingly
reduced to only 2,222 settler families (50% less than the
original target).
3.2.      In  1983,  as  a  result  of prolonged  economic
recession, the Federal Government requested the World
Bank to review the scope of the project.  The Bank came
up with a Special Action Programme (SAP) as a solution to
speed up implementation works as well as the utilization
of the US$40 million loan already approved.   Under the
SAP, the project scope was reduced and the period was
rescheduled for completion by 1986. The gross irrigation
area  was  reduced  from  11,400  ha.   to  4,374  ha.
comprising:   Rompin Priority Area (488 ha), Pontian Sub-
Project (1,250 ha), Anak Endau 'Left Bank and Area A on
the Right Bank (2,636 ha). A reduction in the hectarage
of the project area, further reduced the number of
settlers to only 880.



-9-
3.3.      With a reduction in scope, the total project
cost was reestimated at M$182 million.   The amount of
loan provided by the World Bank remained unchanged.
However, to utilize the loan funds more effectively,
disbursement rate for civil works was raised from 24% to
60% during the period January 1, 1984 to June 30, 1986
and thereafter to only 30%.
3.4.      In early 1985, the project was again subjected
to another review that subsequently led to a change in
the projects original social and economic objectives.
This was the result of the government decision to reduce
rice production targets to only 55-60% of the national
requirement.      The   reduction   in  the   target   was
necessitated by the fact that production of rice locally
is becoming more costly, increased expenditure borne by
the government in terms of input subsidy and price
support, and an excessively substantial amount of
investment to be expended for provision of irrigation
infrastructure and world market for rice becoming more
competitive.
3.5.      Under   the   new   rice   production   policy,
production is to be confined to the existing eight
granary areas and other areas are to be gradually phased
out of paddy.   Since the READP is no more accorded a
granary area, decisi6n was made for the project to switch
from paddy to other crops.   Part of the infrastructure



-10-
that had already been completed had to be modified, where
possible,   to   suit   the   irrigation   and   drainage
requirements of alternative crops.
3.6.      Based on the soil and crop suitability studies
carried out by the Department of Agriculture, the Project
11th Steering Committee Meeting held on January 9, 1986
had concluded that except for the Rompin Priority Area,
the whole project area was to be planted mainly with oil
palm.   The Rompin Priority Area was allowed to continue
planting paddy as land development and irrigation works
for this area had been completed and some farmers had
already  been  resettled.        Thus,  from  the  reduced
hectareage of 4,374 hectares only about 300 ha. in the
Rompin Priority Area had actually been cultivated with
paddy. This reduction in net production area was due to
larger than expected proportion of peat soils and
expected farming constraints.
3.7.      When  decision  to  change  the  scope  of  the
project was made, most of the contract works planned
under the SAP were already in progress and some had even
a1*1            been  completed.       However,  most  of  the  completed
infrastructural works were located mainly in the Rompin
Priority Area as shown in Appendix I.
3.8.       In compliance with the decision made,  no new
contracts were tendered out.   However, most of the on-



- ii -
going contracts had to be continued since some of them
were nearing completion and premature termination of some
contracts would have financial repercussions on the part
of the government.
4.  STATUS OF JMPLMENTATION
A.   PHYSICAL -. Detailed explanation by contracts is as
in Appendix II.
4.1. Jungle Clearing
4.1.1.    Jungle clearing works in the four sub-project
areas comprising 6,562 ha. had already been completed.
Total expenditure was M$16,000,379.04.
4.2. Construction of Dams and Veir
4.2.1.    Two major dams i.e. Pontian Dam and Anak Endau
Dam and a weir at Sungai Anak Endau were constructed.
The expenditure for the constrlsction of these dams was
M$28,026, 276.86.   Impounding at the two major dams began
in mid-December 1985.
4.3. Construction of Irrigation System
ana TertLary Unit
4.3.1.    From the planned 4,374 ha. of paddy area, only
488 ha. in the Rompin Priority Area had been developed.
However, out of this 488 ha., only 300 ha. were found to



_ 12-
be suitable for paddy cultivation. The remaining area is
a problem soil area. In the other sub-project areas, the
basic facilities were not completed and some were
abandoned by the contractors. Total expenditure incurred'
was M*13,405,369.33.
4.4. Construction of Settlement Area's
4.4.1.    Prior to the decision to change the scope of
the project, development of the two settlement areas i.e.
Rompin and Pontian Left Bank was already in progress.
100 units of settler houses were planned for the Rompin
Priority Settlement Area and another 110 for the Pontian
Left Bank.  As a result of changes in the project scope
and the subsequent reduction in the number of settler
intake, the number of houses in the two settlement areas
were accordingly reduced from 100 units to 63 units for
the Rompin Priority and from 110 units to 70 units for
the Pontian Left Bank.   Some M$3,903,316 was spent to
finance the two settlement areas. Currently, only Rompin
Priority Settlement Area is occupied by the first batch
of 31 settler families that was taken in during
September, 1985.
4.5. Paddy Cultivation in Rompin Priority Sub-Project
4.5.1.    Paddy   was   first   cultivated   by   the   31
participants in the last 1985/86 beason. With 4.8 ha. to
a farmer, the total hectarage of cultivated area was
148.8 ha.   Planting was done by direct seeding.   The



-13-
average yield obtained was 3.4 mt/ha and each settler had
grossed on average an income of MS6,000 during the
season.   Marketing of paddy was done through the LPh
purchasing centre at Kuala Rompin.
4.6. Procurement of Machinery. Agricultural
Upuient and Vehicle.
4.6.1.    Various machinery and agricultural  equipment
and   vehicles   were   purchased   to   facilitate   the
implementation of the project.  Procurements were mainly
made by the various components through the Central
Government Contract.
i)      Agricultural Machinery
Among   the   agricultural   machinery
purchased were tractors, harvestors and
their components.  These machines were
utilised by the agriculture components
for demonstration purposes as well as
by the Farmers' Mechanization Centre
(PMC) to provide the necessary services
to farmers.
(ii)    Miscellaneous Agricultural Equipment
Agricultural  equipment purchased  were
water pumps, lawn mowers, water tanks,
power  sprayers  etc.    Most  of  the
equipment were used by the agriculture
component for demonstration purposes.



- 14 -
(1ii)   Office Vehicles
The project purchased 6 four-wheel
vehicles, 2 motorcycles and 5 lorries.
B.   FIINACIAL
44. UxDenditure
4.7.1.    Up to September, 1986 about M$84.546 million
was spent.   Meanwhile, about M$3.596 million had been
committed.  Therefore, total expenditure expected until
the closing date of the Project Office (December 31,
1986) should be M$88.142 million.  The yearly breakdown
of expenditure is as follows:
Year                 M$ Million
1981                    3.072
1982                    14.560

Total            84.546
4.8. Loan
4.8.1.    A sum  of US$40 million was provided  by the
World Bank to finance the project (Loan ho. 1957 MA).
The loan took effect on October 15, 1981 and the closing
date was-June 30, 1986.
4.8.2.    Allocation and utilization of the loan proceeds

5.  ISSUES AhD LESSONS TO BE LEAR1!
5.1. PROJECT DNPUIUBITATIOD
5.1.1.   Ia.lementation Strategy
5.1.1.1.  Since the Rompin sub-project was considered as
the most difficult area to be developed, it was a
mistake  to  choose  this  area  as  a  priority.    The
Appraisal Report recommended that development priority
should be accorded to the Endau and Anak Endau sub-
projects.   On the basis of technical consideration and
accessibility, the Rompin area should be the last area
to be developed.
5.1.1.2.  Simultaneous  implementation of all the sub-
projects had affected, to a certain extent, the overall
performance of the project.   Since this was the first
projecV of its nature, its implementation should have
been phased out and works in a sub-project should have
begun after completion of the other.  Such a strategy is
deemed necessary to acquire the relevant experience for
the subsequent smooth project implementation.
5.1.1.3. The soil feasibility study undertaken by the
consultant  was  only  useful  for  the  construction  of
drainage infrastructure and it was not detailed enough
to determine the suitability of the soil for crops.  The
weakness in this soil stddy was detected when detailed
soil investigation undertaken by the project at the
early stage of project imnplementation, revealed that



- 20
about 30% of the 4,374 ha. under Phase I was peaty and
not suitable for paddy cultivation.
5.1.2.    ProJect Imnlementation Delay
5.1.2.1.  Completion of most of the contract works were
delayed. Among the major problems encountered were late
forest release, peat soils, prolonged inclement weather
and the contractors' problems.
5.1.2.2. Too many contract works were awarded to one
contractor.    For  example,  6 out of  16  construction
contracts were given to one contractor.   In addition,
variation  works  which  were  quite  distinct  from  the
original  contracts  were  also  issued  to  the  same
contractor. Hence, the capacity and performance of the
contractors were affected resulting in their inability
to complete the work on schedule.
5.1. 2.3.  Frequent   alterations   to   the   original
structural  plan of civil works not only delayed the
project completion but also inflated the cost of the
proj ect.
5.1.2.4. The contractors ability in completing the
works on schedule depended on their financial strength,
technical capability and experience. Failure to select
a good contractor would, to a large extent, affect the
project implementation.   For example, the construction



- 21 -
of an irrigation canal at Pontian Left Bank and the
develoypent of tertiary unit in Pontian Left and Right
Bank had been terminated after the contractor abandoned
the work.
5.1.3.    Chnge.s In ProJect Scoo
5.1.3.1. The decision to change the cropping pattern of
the  project  was  not  opportune  and  was  made  rather
late.   When the decision was made, contract works were
already in an advance stage and some were nearing
completion.       The   changes,   therefore,   rendered
construction works useless.   Examples were the lined
canals,  irrigation  structures,  etc.    Many  completed
structures have now become an incomplete system due to
J              cancellation of some related contracts.   For example,
Anak Endau Dam and Anak Endau Weir could not function as
intended  without  the  irrigation  infrastructure  to
receive water from the dam and the weir.   Similarly,
Pontian Dam and the main canals in Pontian sub-project
could not be utilized without the tertiary canals and
A              field ditches.
5.1.4.    Change of Crog and Closure of
'','44 § ~~The Project Off>ice
5.1.4.1. Under the new national rice policy, the Rompin
Endau Area is not categorised as a granary area.  This
i              decision is very significant in determining the future
course of the project.  The change of crop from paddy to



- 22 -
oil palm or other highly economical crops requires a new
development plan.  The change further needs a new form
of management to meet the management requirement of the
selected  crops.    This  ceased  the  functions  of  the
existing  Project  Office  and,   thus,   it  is  only
appropriate that it was dissolved.
6.  REPLAflIIG OP RCMPII-E!DAU
6.1.      DARA    has    been    entrusted    with    the
responsibility of coordinating the preparation of the
new development plan for the Rompir.-Endau Area.
6.2.      The  development  strategy  proposed  by  DARA
emphasises on the involvement of local residents for
their maximum benefit from the future programs.   In
addition,  it  tries  to ensure  that the  Rompin-Endau
program  and  its  development  are  coordinated  and
integrated with the Pahang Tenggara Region in particular
and the  Pahang State in general.   The program also
considers the maximum utilization of agricultural land
J               with suitable crops in accordance to the condition and
4               suitability of the land.   DARA has also proposed the
involvement of the private sector in the Rompin-Endau
Development.  The new development plan for the area is
currently being finalised.

7. PERFORMAhCU OF WORLD BAMc
7.1.      Generally, the performance of the Bank staff
who were responsible for the project was satisfactory.
The supervision had been regular and almost all tne time
attended to by the same officer

COMPLET1Oh OP COITRACTS WORKS
1. Jungle Clearing
In a  large-scale  project  such  as the Rompin-Endau
Agricultural Development Project, implementation woula
involve cooperation and coordination from the various
agencies,  departments  and  ministries.    To  ensure
implementation   of   the   plans   as   scheduled,   an
integrated action would, therefore, be essential,
One  of the main  problems  in this project was with
at                regard to forest release.  For the jungle clearing to
be  carried  out  smoothly,  it  would  require  whole-
release  of  the  forest.    However  the  forest  was
actually  released  part by  part.   Thus the waiting
period for the forest release caused a delay in jungle
clearing contracts.
The smooth implementation of contract works requires
all the areas iaentified for develojinent to be free
fromn all physical obstacles, sucn as tne late forest
release in this Froject.
2.  Quarry Site
Delayed  release  ul quarry  site naa  upset tne  work
schedule  (le,  in  HIA;P  7  ana  MIADP  8).    After
coih:letion of the' dar construction, the contractors



-36-
conce"ned are now putting forward claims for losses
associated with delayed release of quarry sites.
3.  Contractor's Financial Weaknlms
The contract sums of the contracts awarded when the
time of economic slowdown,  were generally low.   In
addition,   the   poor  financial   standinG  of   the
contractor had necessitated the determination of two
contracts (ie. READP 21 and READP 27) with original
contract sums amounting to 06,153,475/=.   Tnis action
was taken in view of the deteriorating financial
status of the contractor and his apparent incapability
to complete the work.
4.  Permit/Licence
The   late   release   of  permits  and   licence  for
transporting  aggregates,  sand  and  borrow materials
also caused delay in the work schedules.
5.  Change in Scope of Project
Changes  in  tne  scope  of the  project nad  rendered
construction jworKs useless, examples. were the linea
canals,  irrigation  structures  etc.   `lariy completea
infrastructures  oecame an  incomplete  sisteIz, due  to
cancellation of some related contracts.  For example,
Anak Endau Dam and Anak Enaau WJeir could not function
as iritendea withotkt the irridation infrastructures to
*- receive the reservoir water of the aai; and tne weir.



- 37 -
Main canals in Pontian sub-project could not be
utilised without the tertiary canals and field
ditches.
6. Regrovths
Secondary vegetation was fast spreading on the non-
used proJect areas which had been cleared.   As time
lapsed,  the  regrowth  problams  were  becoming  more
serious and large sums of money might be required to
clear these areas should these areas be redeveloped.
