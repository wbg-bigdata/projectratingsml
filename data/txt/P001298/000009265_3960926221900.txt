PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
KENY
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT CREDIT
(IDA CREDIT 1927-KE AND
AFRICAN FACILITY CREDIT A-036-RE)
PREFACE
This is a Program Performance Audit Report (PPAR) on the Industrial
Seccor Adjustment Credit (ISAC), involving IDA Credit 1927-KE and Afr4can
Facility Credit A-036-KE.  The IDA Credit, in the amount of US$102.0 mil-
lion, was approved in June 1988 and the last disbursement was in Decembe-
1981; the credit was closed in April 1990, on schedule.   The Dievi-c-Ipment
Credit Agreement was amended in March 1989 to supplement the first tranche
of the Credit with US$53.7 million from IDA Reflows, raising the total of
the Credit to US$155.7 million. The African Facility Credit, in the amount
of U_,$10.0 million, was approved in June 1988 and the last disbursement was
in November 1988; the credit closed, as originally scheduled, in March 1990.
Both credits were fully disbursed.
Cofinancing from donors amounted to US$148.9 million. Cofinanciers
included the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan, $63.1 mn:'.-
lion; the European Investment Bank (EIB), $27.5 million; the African
Development Bank, $23.0 million; the USAID, $14.5 million; the Danish Inter-
national Development Agency (DANIDA), $8.5 million; the Netherlands Finance
Company for Developing Countries (FMO), $7.2 million; and the German Agency
for Technical Cooperation, $5.1 million. This brings the aggregate funding
level to about US$315 million.
The PPAR consists of the Program Performance Audit (PPA) prepared
by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED), and the Program Completion
Report (PCR) prepared by the Africa Region of the Bank (Parts I and III) and
the Borrower's comments (Part II).  The PPA is based on the attached PCR,
the President's Report, sector and economic reports, the credit documents,
the   summary of the Board discussion, study of the project files, and
discussions with Bank staff. An OED mission visitei Kenya in October 1990
and discussed the effectiveness of the Bank's assistance with Government
officials and representatives of the business and financial community.
Their kind cooperation and valuable assistance in the preparation of this
report is gratefully acknowledged. Special thanks go to the Bank's Regional
Office for their assistance.
The PCR provides a very good account and assessment of the program
experience with regard to the implementation of the various action programs;
achievements of the reforms; credit administration, use and coordination;
TDA's role; the sustainability of the adjustment effort; and draws lessons
from the experience.   The PPA discusses the evolution of policy-based
lending in Kenya; portrays briefly the status auo ante and the critical
issues of concern that led to the genesis of the ISAC; assesses the quality



- ii -
of the design of the policy package and action programs, including their
consistency and appropriateness for the problems identified; evaluates the
progress made in enacting and implementing agreed upon action programs,
including complemenuary measures initiated by follow-on sector reform pro-
grams; determines the purposefulness and effectiveness of conditionality end
tranching; and ascertains the key factors that determine ISAC's outcoma, and
the effectiveness and sustainability of the policy reforms.  The PPA then
draws further lessons from the program experience.
Copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the Borrower and the co-
financiers for review and comments, but none were received.

INDUSTRIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT CREDIT
(IDA CREDIT 1927-UE AND
AFRICAN FACILITY CREDIT A-036-KE)
I. BACRGROUND
Evolution of Policy-Based Lending
1.01     In 1980 and 1982, the Bank supported two multi-sectoral structural
adjustment operations which focussed, inter alia, on promoting a more
outward-looking pattern of industrial growth.   The approach involved
rationalization and gradual reduction of industrial protection (e.g.,
phasing out various forms of qtantitative restrictions and their replacement
by tariffs), streamlining of import regulations, and strengthening of the
incentives for the promotion of non-traditional exports. Ex Post evaluation
of these operations indicated that progress was uneven; implementation, with
notable exceptions, on the whole disappointing; and the impact very limited.
The poor results were attributed to an array of factors, including the com-
prehensive scope of the programs, the inadequate analytical underpinning and
specificity of proposed measures, binding institutional constraints
affecting implementation, lack of unanimity within the Government and
fragile commitment concerning the parameters and details of policy actions,
weak inter-ministerial communication and coordination, and inadequate con-
sultation with the private sector on the proposed reforms.   Unforeseen
political developments, the world recession, deterioration of the terms of
trade and balance of payments probleme stalled and, on occasion, led to
retrogressive courses of action.
1.02     In light of the infelicitous experience with the SALs, the Bank
decided to disaggregate structural adjustment lending into a series of
sequenced sector operations based on in-depth economic and sector work and
more thoughtful program preparation -- the Agricultural Sector Adjustment

(ISAC) Program,2 the Financial Sector Adjustment Credit,3 and the Export
Development Project (EDP).4 These were supplemented by the Financial Sector
(1989), and the Financial Parastatals (1990)6 Technical Assistance projects.
The ISAC Program under review follows on the basic reform objectives and
measures adopted in the SAL., but it is more sharply focussed on key
sectoral issues as identified by extensive sector work.7 To achieve intra-
governmental coordination and commitment, the ISAC program was prepared over
a six-month period with input from a government committee, including repre-
sentatives from the implementing ministries and agencies, and regular con-
sultations with the private sector. The Government's Policy Framework Paper
(PFP), agreed with the IMP and IDA, embedded the program in the requisite
macroeconomic policy framework, and provided a mechanism for ensuring con-
sistency between individual sector programs and the macroeconomic reforms
envisaged under the adjustment program.
The Manufacturing Sector at the Mid-1980s
1.03     The manufacturing sector is diversified, comprising some 560
medium-large scale, 720 small scale, and 1,600 micro-enterprises,  and
accounts for some 12% of output and 81 of employment.   The sector is
dominated by long-established multinational and Kenyan-Asian firms producing
mainly for the domestic market.  Excessive protection, ranging from 6% to
312Z and averaging 90Z, has fostered over the years the growth of uncompeti-
tive, capital intensive in relation to the country's factor endowment, and
import (and therefore foreign exchange) intensive industries.   There is
significant disparity in performance and efficiency among subsectors, as
well as among product lines within subsectors, while the inward-looking
trade regime has been unconducive to export promotion.   Relatively
efficient, albeit not necessarily internationally competitive, subsectors
include traditional consumer goods industries (food processing, beverages,
tobacco, wood products) with strong domestic resource links, simple tech-
nology, and long production experience.   Inefficient subsectors, or sub-
sectors with a high value added pertaining to inefficient activities,
include leather and footwear, paper, plastics and pharmaceutic ls,
chemicals, cement and glass, iron and steel products, and electrical and
transport equipment. In some industries (e.g., pharmaceuticals, paint, iron

and steel products, car assembly), the minimum economic scale is substan-
tially larger than the size of the domestic market. The latter also have a
high import content (442-832), and there appears to be a significant inverse
relationship between import content and efficiency in these activities.
Private local firms are more efficient, profitable and least protected,
while parastatals are inefficient, highly protected and less profitable
(para. 3.27).   The foreign private sector ie highly protected, not quite
efficient, and earns about average profits. Finally, much of the industrial
plant is out of date, while the capital stock was estimated in the mid-1980s
to have fallen to 852 of its peak value in 1979 due to declining new
investment.8
1.04     The upshot is that many activities are overprotected; the system
has fostered inefficient use of factors of production; the accrued rent does
not appear to be shared by labor; and that the industrialization strategy
through import substitution has created a strong anti-export bias, as
import-substituting activities have been afforded higher incentives than
export activities (Attachment 5). Despite good intentions, the fact remains
that during the 1980s the manufacturing sector has not been effectively
exposed to foreign competition.   If anything, industries threatened by
imports have recently been shielded through reclassification and shifts
among import schedules (paras. 3.03-3.06).
Performance of Manufacturina Parastatals
1.05     The government has investments in sA,me 104 industrial enterprises,
either through direct ownership or indirectly through development finance
institutions (DFIs).  It has majority holdings in 38 of these firms and a
minority share in 66.  The performance of these enterprises has been dis-
appointing because of poor investment choices, high leverage, inexperienced
management, political interference, unsound financial practices by DFIs,
outdated technology, constraints on access to raw materials, weak super-
vision by the Government and DFIs, and a changing competitive and economic
environment. By 1986, 16 had negative net worth, another 16 had accumulated
net losses, and most others had financial difficulties and faced an uncer-
tain future. Neither the Government nor the DFIs have the capability or the
financial resources to resuscitate the troubled enterprises.
1.06     Recent government efforts to improve parastatal performance
focussed on two areas: improving the suRervision of public enterprises; and
devising a Plan for restructuring or divesting parastatals. There has been
some progress in the area of supervision: the Government enacted the State
Corporations Act (1986, amended in 1990) whereby it reduced direct budgetary
transfers to parastatals; subjected the borrowing power of parastatals to
ministerial and Treasury approval; established more stringent budgeting and
accounting procedures; created the offices of the Auditor General, Corpora-
tions and Inspector of State Corporations, subjecting parastatals to an
annual independent audit and review of management practices; and set up an

Policies for Investment and Export Growth, Vol. II, pp. 54-91.



- 4 -
Advisory Committee to advise the President, inter all,g on the establish-
ment, reorganization, or dissolution of parastatals. These efforts led for
the first time to a better understanding of the financial position and
extent of indebtedness of the parastatals, the identification of defaulters,
and the realization by parastatals that government loans and guarantees will
have to be paid. Nonetheless, supervision of industrial parastatals remains
diffused across several ministries and agencies which makes it difficult to
instill financial discipline.  In addition, institutional capabilities are
limited, and the tenor of the State Corporations Act tends to induce less,
rather than more autonomy in decision-making, as the emphasis is on ex-ante
controls rather than ex-post performance evaluation. While the Government's
concern to prevent losses and abuses through ex ante controls is understand-
able, intrusive controls on day-to-day operations tend to hamper managerial
independence.  Ex post evaluation of the results achieved based on agreed
objectives and criteria, including sanctions for poor performance, are more
effective in ensuring the desired outcome.
1.07     In the area of divestiture, The Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 indi-
cated that Government would retain in the public domain only those enter-
prises which offered administrative, public and social services not provided
by the private sector. Few, if any, industrial parastatals fall into these
categories.   In 1983, the Government established a Task Force on Divesti-
ture, which produced a preliminary classification of public enterprises into
those to be retained and those to be divested or liquidated, highlighted
subsectoral policy issues, and discussed various mechanisms for divestiture.
However, the Government has moved very slowly on divestiture. To date, on'y
a major food processing firm and six equity holdings by one of the DFIs have
been sold (PR, para. 3.23).
The State of the Financial Sector9
1.08     Kenya has a diverse and probably overbanked system of financial
intermediaries (24 commercial banks, 50 near-bank financial institutions --
NBFIs, and 10 DFIs).   Nonetheless, except for prime clients, the avail-
ability of long-term funds continues to be limited. The four large institu-
tions that dominate the sector (of which two are state-owned) have strong
ties to multinational and top-rated companies, and remain conservative in
their lending practices.  Commercial banks usually do not extend term loans
for more than three years, and such loans are highly collaterized. More-
over, banks are reluctant to accept land deeds as collateral because of the
long time required to gain possession.   Because of strict collateral
requirements. small- and medium-sized firms with little equity backing are
crowded out of the loan market, and the vast majority of loans go to large,
prime borrowers.  The competition for funds from NBFIs and the associated
rise in the average cost of funds, combined with the lower maximum ceiling
on bank loans (14Z) compared to NBFIs (192), had rendered many banks (in
particular the large traditional banks) even more conservative in their
lending policies.   Furthermore, as leneing rate ceilings prevented risk
premiums from being reflected in the rate schedules, there has been little
9/ For a review and assessment of financial policies and industrial
financing see World Bank, Ken=a - Industrial Finance.



- 5 -
incentive for banks to extend maturity lengths beyond three years or mike
loans to riskier borrowers. A further constraint on the supply (and demand)
of industrial finance has been the restrictions placed on the amount of
domestic currency funds that non-Kenyan firms cart borrow under exchange
controls (202 of their initl'd equity capital), which raised considerably
their exposure to exchange rate risk since the bulk of their borrowing cost
remains linked to foreign currencies and their revenues to shillings.
1.09     The DFIs have failed to develop an appropriate organizational
structure, systems and procedures, work methods, and a balanced structure of
operations; have not been able to operate on sound banking principles and
financial discipline; and their project selection has not been rational, in
part due to perfunctory economic analysis and external encroachments on
their decision-making process.   Their performance deteriorated further
because of the increased competition from commercial banks and NBFIs in
their traditional markets. Ae commercial banks increased their term lending
activities, earlier co-financing arrangements between DFIe and commercial
banks ensuring complementary local currency financing were discontinued and,
unable to raise local resources and offer a full range of financing, the
DFIs' competitiveness eroded further. Furthermore, prime private borrowers
with sound projects prefer to deal with commercial banks and not have to put
up with the long and involved appraisal routine of the DPIs. In effect, the
DFIs' clientele included largely those who could not obtain credit elsewhere
because of insufficient collateral or lack of experience, and those who had
political clout.   As a result, the DPI. ended up supporting projects of
questionable viability and otherwise risky, accumulated substantial losses
over the years, required periodic injection of funds from the budget, and
their competitive position relative to other financial institutions was
eroded. In addition, many DFI clients became illiquid or insolvent, in part
because of the impact of exchange rate devaluations on their foreign-
exchange denominated debt.10   Unable to extricate themselves from past
investment decisions and attract viable new investments, the DFIs now face
intractable operational ond portfolio problems.
1.10     While a nucleus of well-managed banks, NBFIs, and building socie-
ties exists and accounts for the largest share of the banking sector, most
of these institutions are experiencing serious financial difficulties. Low
entry barriers designed to promote indigenous institutions have resulted in
a rapid increase in the number of new financial institutions since 1980.
However, many of the newer institutions lacked sufficient capital and
qualified staff to operate effectively, operated on inadequate spreads and
mismatched resources, and ran through their capital and depositors' funds
supporting unviable projects -- often to themselves or associated companies.
Although NBFIs were initially created to provide specialized financial
services (e.g., merchant banking, leasing, hire/purchase), provisions in the
banking law made it easy for commercial banks to set up NBFIs to circumvent

the restrictions on commercial bank activities and interest rate ceilings.
As a result, the distinction between commercial bank and NBFI activities
began to blur over time and competition intensified. To grow, many of the
weaker institutions sought out new business more aggressively, and took
increased risks at lower margins. In 1986, two small banks and four NBFIs
suspended operation  "'ecause of inadequate capital and inappropriate lending
practices."1   In  1988,  4 banks  and 24 NBFIs were  having  serious
difficulties, with 7 NBFIs appearing to be insolvent.   Subsequently, the
Government amended the Banking Act to strengthen banking supervision and the
Central Bank took steps to improve it& capabilities in this area.   Many
building societies also have been experiencing serious difficulties and are
in effect winding down as deposits are exheusted. As with the NBFls, a lax
regulatory environment led to rapid growth of these institutions.   Until
1987, building societies were neither regulated nor licensed by the Central
Bank.   Furthermore,  the rapid proliferation of institutions quickly
outstripped the ability of the Central Bank to monitor and regulate their
activities.   Thus,  instead of broadening  the scope and increasing
competition in the financial system, these weaker institutions have
destabilized the market, driving depositors back to the four major
institutions.
1.11     Capital markets had remained relatively inactive, constrained,
inter alia, by the controls of the Capital Issues Committee (CIC). Estab-
lished in 1971, the CIC regulated the size, timing and pricing of issues.
But because of their lengthy deliberations and tendency to price issues
below market values, CIC effectively deterred firms from tapping the equity
market.   Tax provisions and regulations over holdings of institutional
investors (particularly insurance companies) and certain legal requirements
(disclosure, restrictive admission to the Stock Exchange, etc.) were addi-
tional disincentives to using the capital market.   For instance, the tax
treatment of equity instruments was less favorable than that for debt.
Taxes on securities transactions and dividends, and the non-deductibility of
capital losses, underwriting and other business expenses effectively raised
the cost of equiity relative to debt.  The extent of pre-emptive rights of
existing shareholders and limitations on repatriation of capital gains
provided further disincentives for issuing shaves. And, because of the low
level of activity in securities markets, few institutions and individuals
issued and traded securities (PR, para. 3Q25).
Macroeconomic Framework and Performance
1.12     In the early  1980s,  severe internal and external imbalances
developed because of external shocks, erosion in fiscal discipline, and poor
monetary management.  In response, the Government tightened fiscal policy,
devalued the real effective exchange rate, allowed interest rates to become
positive in real terms and real wages to fall, and temporarily intensified
import restrictions.   GDP growth decelerated significantly during the
stabilization period which lasted through the mid-1980s, but the budgec and
the current account deficits fell substantially as a percent of GDP. More

- 7 -
dramatic was the decline in inflation (Attachment 1).  At that time, the
Government began to implement structural reforms. In agriculture, selected
key producer prices were increased. In industry, import bans and no-objec-
tion certificates as instruments of protection were eliminated, and a more
rational system of import classification for licensing purposes was imple-
mented by introducing import schedules. lowever, the ensued sharp decline
in foreign exchange reserves and the inadequate external assistance forced
the Goverrment to suspend the new import regime and replace it with more
stringent arrangements, which were more restrictive and arbitrary than the
import regulations they replaced.  Eventually, the import regulations were
revised to add flexibility and accommodate fluctuations in foreign exchange
availability.  Gradually, the Government increased the number of items and
value of imports that came under the least restrictive import schedule,
rationalized some tariffs, and lowered the avertge rate by about 8Z in three
budgets. Nevertheless, the ultimate goal to Dut in place by the end of 1985
a tariff structure that would 2ermit a relativell free flow of im2orts was
not attained, and the import liberalization momentum could not be sustained.
1.13     Imbalances re-emerged in 1987 following significant swings in the
terms of trade and lax fiscal and financial management, resulting in an
intensification of inflationary pressures, and rapidly rising budget and
current account deficits (Attachment 1). There was a major drain in foreign
exchange reserves and the import regime was tightened to stem the inflow of
imports.  In view of the detericeation of economic conditions, the Govern-
ment adopted a stabilization program, which was agreed jointly between the
Government, the INF and IDA.   The program was supported by an 18-month
Stand-by arrangement from the IMF and a three-year arrangement under the
IMF's Structural Adjustment Facility, both of which became effective in
February 1988.   In early 1989, the Government requested support under a
three-year Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, currently in its third
year of operation. The program was further supported by sectoral adjustment
lending for the agricultural, industrial and financial sectors, with sig-
nificant co-financing by a number of donors. The Government's stabilization
program aimed to reduce the budget deficit, control monetary expansion and
reduce the rate of inflation, maintain an appropriate exchange rate policy
that would support the import liberalization program and correct for dif-
ferentials in domestic and international inflation, limit the use of new
non-concessional foreign borrowing to improve Kenya's debt service ratio,
and reduce the current account deficit.
II. CONCEPT AND DESIGN OF ACTION PROGRAMS
Industrial Develonment Strategy
2.01     The Government's Sessional Paper (1986), which provides policy
guidelines for the coulntry's development for the remainder of the century,
assigns a dominant role to the private sector for revitalizing the economy,
and affirms that the Government will establish market-based incentives for
private sector investment, while relying less on instruments of direct
control.  The strategy emphasizes the need for more uniform import tariffs



and more liberal import licensing to increass efficiency in the manufac-
turing sector and encourage exports, the importance of industrial restruc-
turing to improve competitiveness, and the use of exchange rate management
to maintain Kenya's competitiveness in world marketv, regulate imports, and
sustain the process of import liberalization.
Objectives. Policy Instruments. Conditiognality
2.02     The ISAC program was the first in a series of industrial and finan-
cial sector operations (para. 1.02), providing the foundation for Kenya's
medium-term adjustment program as outlined in the Government's Letter of
Industrial Policy (Attachment 2) and summarized in the Summary Reform
Program policy matrix (PCR, Annex 1). The ISAC program attempted to address
the most troublesome issues facing Kenya's industrial sector -- stagnant
investment and exports whose revival was viewed as essential to revitalize
the sector.  The proposed policy reforms vere intended as important first
steps in improving the sector's efficiency and in reducing the anti-export
bias of the incentive structure, and were expected to generate a quick and
strong supply response from new investment. This would further ensure that
the growth of the sector would be sustained, and the adverse impact on
employment would be mitigated, when measures to be taken later on might
result in the closure of inefficient firms (PR, para. 3.05).
2.03     The reform package consisted of:   (a) trade liberalization and
tariff reform, intended to make imported inputs more freely available for
production, and promote competition and efficiency through progressive
introdvction of unrestrictive licensing, conversion of QRs into tariffs 
tariff reductions, and evening out the structure of efrective protection;
(b) imorovement of the incentive structure to foster new investment and
exports through price decontrol, company tax reform, changes in the regula-
tory regime, easier access to duty-free inputs, and provision of infrastruc-
tural facilities to exporters; (c) divestiture of industrial public enter-
Rrises and improvement of the performance monitoring system for those to be
retained in the public sector; and (d) capital ard financial market reforms,
to support the restructuring of DFIs and their portfolios, strengthen the
money and capital markets, and broaden the range of financial instruments
available to private investors (PR, paras. 3.05, 3.07, 3.24, 3.2.).
2.04     In addition, to provide the requisite underpinning for the formula-
tion of specific policy measures, seven studies would be undertaken
involving: assessment of the impact of unrestrictive licensing on domestip
industries, including an action program to provide domestic industries
equivalent tariff protection and draft anti-dumping legislation; design of
an Import Duty Compensation Scheme; assessment of the impact of price decon-
trols; design of a comprehensive medium-term export promotion program,
including financing,  issurance, establishment of export promotion zones
(EPZs), and information support; review of marginal effective corporate tax
rates, treatment of foreign exchange losses, and revenue implications; study
of DFIs and their portfolios, especially in the textile, motor vehicle and
steel subsectors, including the preparation of an action plan for restruc-
turing/divestiture; and design of a program, including draft legislation,
for the creation of a Capital Markets Development Authority (for details see
PCR, Annex 2).

2.05     The Credit would be disbursed in two tranches, conditional on
satisfactory implementation of the specific actions described in the PCR,
Annexes 1 and 2, and an overall review of the progress of thae macroeconomic
and sectoral reform programs.   The African Facility Credit would be
disbursed in one tranche.   The Credit was expected to be fully disbursed
within 18 months of effectiveness.   Counterpart funds would be used ex-
clusively for the Government's development budget (PR, para. 4.06).
III. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND OUTCOME
A. Trade Liberalization
Import LicensinpR
3.01     The Government has used the import licensing system as a practical
means to close the gap between the demand for imports and availability of
foreign exchange, as well as to protect domestic producers.   Under ISAC,
import licensing would be rationalized by reclassifying items into five
import schedules instead of the existing four (see para. 3.02), to the end
of rendering it less discretionary, more expeditious, and more certain. The
rationalization would lead to a larger percentage of items and volume of
imports licensed without restrictions: the percentage of items would rise
from 45% to 60%, while the value of imports from 822 to 882. The pace of
liberalization was effectively constrained by the low level of foreign
exchange reserves, the uncertainty surrounding the projected large financing
gap in the external sector for 1988-90, and the indeterminate timing of
disbursements of anticipated foreign assistance. Given the prevailing and
prospective macroeconomic situation at the time, the Government was
genuinely concerned about moving too far and too fast on liberalization.
Nevertheless, the Government committed itself to achieving full liberali-
zation, except for a few items, by June 1991.  Thus, items in the revised
category 3B would be licensed unrestrictively by June 1989, while those in
category 3C w :ld be completely liberalized during the ISAC II (now EDP)
period (see para. 3.03).   By June 1989, 762 of items and 952 of imports
(1987) would be licensed without restriction (PR, paras. 3.08-3.12).
3.02     Since June  1988, imports have been reclassified  into five
schedules:   Schedule 1 -- high-priority raw materials, intermediate and
capital goods; Schedule 2 -- bulk items that require ministerial approval
regarding technical specifications (e.g., fertilizer); Schedule 3A -- items
simi'lar to those in Schedule 1, but less standardized; Schedule 3B --
imports that compete with domestic production and are restricted only by
tariffs; and Schedule 3C -- other competing imports and luxury goods,
restricted by QRs, including items whose importation is curbed for public
health and safety reasons.12  In addition, the import licensing system has
been streamlined, resulting in significant reduction of delays in processing
and uncertainty regarding license approvals.   Indicatively, the time lag
from license application to allocation of foreign exchange for imports has
12/ As can be seen, consumer goods, intermediate inputs ana capital goods
are to be found across all Schedules.



- 10 -
been reduced from about six months to one month in the last year or so.
Furthermore, when licenses are rejected, importers are informed of the
reasons that led to such a decision.
3.03     On the whole, the import licensing system has been made more trans-
parent by replacing QRs based on import licensing with tariffs, and licenses
are now granted automatically for all imports except those on Schedule 3C.
As Table 1 in PCR, para. 6 shows, QRs in FY91 affect about 222 of all
imported items compared to 402 in FY87, but only 52 of the total import
value compared to 122 in FY87, suggesting significant progress in the
liberalization of imports, greater reliance on tariffs as the main instru-
ment of protection, and compliance with undertakings (para. 3.01). QRs on
Schedule 3B were replaced with tariffs that in most cases provide less than
equivalent protection. But, when automatic licensing was instituted in 1989
and 1990, some tariff rates were raised for items on Schedule 3B that com-
pete with domestic production (see para. 3.06).   During the ISAC program
implementation, it was agreed with the Government that the composition of
import Schedule 3B would be revised, by removing some items that competed
with vulnerable domestic industries before extending automatic licensing to
this schedule in June 1989. It is now envisaged that the extension of auto-
matic licensing to these imports would be completed in June 1991, a year
later than the original timetable (PCR, para. 7).  Thus, import licensing
remains in place as a convenient device to balance import demand with avail-
able foreign exchange resources in the face of uncertainty regarding balance
of payments developments.
Tariffs
3.04     Although the unweigiit'vd and weighted average tariffs have not been
scessive (Attachment 3), because of their cascading structure and vari-
ability on final goods, average effective protection had remained high --
90% for the sector in 1987.  The Govenament is committed to lowering and
reducing the dispersion of effective rates of protection.   But while
lowering protection is the ultimate objective, the major reforms would be
implemented in the second & d third phases of the adjustment program
(1990-1993) in order to accommodate as a matter of priority the lifting of
QRs on imports. Nonetheless, tie Government undertook in 1988 and 1989 to
rationalize further tariffs by e :ablishing uniform rates for similar goods;
reduce the number of tariff levals from 25 to 12, mainly by eliminating
tariffs at the higher end; and review sDecific duties with a view to con-
verting them into ad valorem rates (PR, para. 3.'1).
3.05     In June 1990, a large block of items (552) were transferred from
Schedule 3C to 3B. But QRs on Schedule 3C imports, despite the reduction in
import coverage, continue to protect a large proportion of domestic value
added in manufacturing,13 including the bulk of food processing, textiles,
leather processing, and fabricated metal subsectors.   These subsectors
include firms not yet sufficiently strong to face competition, but mostly
parastatals in financial difficulty which require rehabilitation before they
can be exposed to import competition based on equivalent tariffs.  It goes
13/ The precise percentage is difficult to estimate due to the lack of
compatible production and import data.



- 11 -
without saying that the afforded QR protection is not transparent, cor-
responds to higher tariff-equivalents than the maximum nominal tariff,
provides differential protection to firms even within the same industry, and
implies a revenue loss to the Government.   However, under the Export
Development Project (EDP) conditionality, and except for products that would
be retained in Schedule 3C (and be subject to QR,s) for public health,
environmental and public safety reasons, all other items currently in 3C
would be shifted to Schedule 3B by June 30. 1991, and equivalent or lower
tariffs would be imposed on imports (EDP, para. 2.29).
3.06     The proposed new import schedule reclassification under ISAC
provided for an average unweighted tariff of 392 and a weighted one of 24%
(Attachment 3). As Table 1 (PCRI para. 6) shows, as a result of measures
announced in the FY91 Budget, the weighted average tariff 'i now about 20%,
lower than in FY87 by about 5 percentage points.   Th4  reduction was
achieved by shifting a large number of items currently in Schedules 1
through 3B to the next lower tariff rate, and implied a proportionately
larger cut in Schedule 3B (mainly competing imports). However, not atypical
of the first phase of import liberalization, the unweighted average tariff
has riven from 392 to 46Z due to the conversion of QRs on Schedule 3B
imports to their tariff equivalents. In fact, Attachment 4 shows that, if
imports are classified by end-use, except for capital goods, both unweighted
and weighted average tariffs for consumer and intermediate goods increased
appreciably between FY87 and FY89. This seems to suggest that, although the
average tariff is moderate, because of the cascading structure of nominal
tariffs which has increased since FY87, effective protection rates for an
array of activities remain relatively high.
3.07     The pattern of iisDersion is evident from Attachment 4, which shows
that the average effective tariffs on capital, intermediate and consumer
goods were 202, 22Z, and 352 respectively in PY87, and 152, 212 and 352 in
FY89. A first step toward reducing dispersion (and simplifying the tariff
structure) was taken in the form of a reduction in the number of tariff
categories from 25 to 12, replacement of most specific duties with ad
valorem rates, and rate revisions to ensure that similar rates apply to
comparable products.   Greater uniformity of nominal rates would also help
prevent anomalies caused by the fact that many articles may be used either
as final cr intermediate products, since it does not make sense to levy
different rates on the same product depending on the end use. The disper-
-ion of tariff rates was also reduced by eliminating the highest rate cate-
gory (1352) for all schedules, the next highest category (1002) for many
items ir all schedules except the present 3C, and moving some items at
"zero" tariff rates to the next highest rate.  The latter move would also
reduce the incentive for over-invoicing imports.   Nevertheless, the level
and variability of protection is also affected significantly by the high
frequency of ad hoc (and arbitrary) duty exemptions. Detailed data on such
exemptions are not available; but the observed difference between statutory
and effective tariff rates largely stem from such exemptions, coupled with
leakages at Customs resulting from institutional shortcomings (Attach-
ment 4). Both result in substantial revenue losses; but the sanction of ad
hoc exemptions tends to foster discrimination, abuse and uncertainty, there-
by undermining the tariff rationalization effort.



- 12 -
3.08     Certain anomalies emanating from the recent reclassification of
items desorve attention. They include cases where there is need for tariff
differentiation where finished products and components are imported using
the some tariff code, and where duties between raw materials and finished
products remain undifferentiazed.   At times, the import duty on finished
products is lower than that for raw materials while, on occasion, reclas-
sification of items has resulted in components for industrial products being
subjected to higher duties than before. There are also instances where the
duty differential between raw materials and finished products is marginal
(5S).   Such incidents tend to discourage local fabrication and potential
exports. In the same vein, and in order to ensure that all products whose
end use is similar are subjected to the same duty/VAT, VAT-exempted items
should be extended to all such similar items (e.g., plastic packages).
Finally, raw materials whose final processed products are VAT-exempt should
also be VAT-exempt, since the effect of VAT levied on raw materials that
cannot be offset by the output tax is to increase the rate of import duty.
3.09     As part of the EDP conditionality, further tariff reductions would
be announced by June 30. 1991. Combined with continued efforts to maintain
an appropriate exchange rate, the aim would be to remove QRs on most
Schedule 3C imports by shifting them into Schedule 3B, to reduce the level
of effective protection through a reduction in average tariffs of a similar
magnitude to that implemented in the FY90 Budget, and to narrow further the
dispersion of tariff rates.   To compensate for revenue losses from the
tariff changes in June 1990 and June 1991, VAT coverage and rates would be
increased.   A first set of adjustments was announced in the June 1990
Budget. Tariff exemptions provided to non-exoorters would be reviewed in a
Ministry of Finance study, and revenue losses from such exemptions would be
reduced by June 1991.   Finally, in order to reduce speculation and the
erosion of import duties, the period for which imported items may be stored
in common bonded warehouses was reduced to a maximum of one year in June
1990, after which period such goods would be subject to duty (EDP,
para. 2.29).
B. Export Incentives14
The Export Compensation Scheme (ECS)
3.10     The ECS, implemented in 1974 as the primary policy initiative to
counterbalance the anti-export bias, has been marred by frequent changes and
administrative delays in making payments, has benefitted a few large
exporters, and has failed to encourage exports.   Moreover, the flat 201
rebate rate either under- or over-compensates products according to their
import content (since tariffs on intermediate and raw material imports range
from 0 to 80X), while its reliance on an arbitrary positive list to define
eligibility limits access to duty-free imports by all potential exporters
(PR, para. 3.14).15 Furthermore, the benefits of the ECS are not extended
to indirect exporters, procedures do not allow the exporter flexibility in
14/ See also section on regulatory reforms, pas. as. 3.22-3.30.

Association of Manufacturers, Exoort Incentives for Kenvan Industry,
August 1989, pp. 28-37.

the use of payments, while the compensation is paid by Customs and not by
the commercial banks, resulting in lengthy verification procedures and long
delays.
3.11     Based on a study to be commissioned, the Government committed
itself to design and implement by June 1989 a simple Import Duty Compensa-
tion Scheme (duty drawback system) to replace the ECS (PCR, Annex 1, p. 2).
The study concluded that a duty drawback system would be administratively
difficult to implement, and recommended that the present compensation scheme
be retained. However, the coverage should be widened and the administration
improved to ensure faster reimbursement.   The Government accepted the
findings and decided to retain the present ECS, but the coverage of the
existing ECS has been expanded from some 800 items in 1988 to 1,250 in 1990,
while reimbursement fo,r the bulk of the applications is effected currently
in slightly over a month. Nonetheless, despite these improvements, the ECS
continues to suffer from the fundamental shortcomings mentioned
(para. 3.10).
Imiort Duty Exemption
3.12     In late 1990, an import duty/VAT exemption scheme was introduced to
providi direct exDorters access to inputs at international prices.   The
scheme is tied to specific export contracts or past export performance; it
is based on product-specific value coefficients; eligibility is broader than
under the ECS; and import documentation, ex gost audits, and performance
bonds posted by exporters would be used to limit abuses. In the first year
of operation, the number of products eligible for the duty/VAT exemption
would be broadened every quarter, but in the following year a negative list
would be implemented. Thus, henceforth, exporters would be able to choose
between the ECS and the exemption scheme, albeit safeguards will be insti-
tuted to prevent use of both facilities for the same export consignment.
Under the EDP, a study will be undertaken to determine the need for con-
tinuing the ESC in view of the introduction of the import duty/VAT exemption
program, and design of the subsequent phases of the latter for direct
exporters (EDP, para. 2.44).
Manufacturins Under Bond (MUB)
3.13     The Government undertook to issue guidelines and Drocedures for
MUB, a scheme whereby Customs authorities allow imported materials destined
for use in the production of goods for export to be cleared without payment
of import duties or taxes (PR, para. 3.14). The Government has complied and
the scheme, which is administered jointly by the Investment Promotion Center
(IPC) and Customs, became operational in 1988 under the provisions of the
Finance Bill, 1988. Nevertheless, only a limited number of exporters have
made use of this facility (five in 1990, although several others have been
licensed but have not begun operations), because it excludes firms producing
less than lOO for exports, the annual license bond is considered to be
excessive, requires exporters to post additional security bonds (e.g., to
remove goods for manufacturing and export, to cover duty on imports from
various ports of entry), prohibits domestic sales of off-cuts and rejects,
requires evidence of pre-identified market for 1002 of output, etc. (see



- 14 -
also para. 3.24). Moreover, these restrictive requirements discourage firms
from setting up subcontracting operations.16 Recently, to rectify some of
these shortcomings and as a condition of EDP, the HUB system was modified to
reduce operating costs (e.g., bond requirements covering the transit of
goods between warehouses and factories was simplified), allow firme to sell
rejects in the domestic market, and extend the scheme to three new urban
centers, in addition to the three at which MUB is currently in operation
(EDP, para. 2.30).   Further actions to be taken under EDP to streamline
licensing procedures are detailed in para. 3.25 below. Also, under a pro-
posed study, the notion of common bonded warehouses will be explored to
extend free trade status to indirect exporters (EDP, para. 2.44). Although
these are tangible improvements, exclusion of firms that export less than
100X remains a highly restrictive and unrealistic requirement.
Corporate Taxation
3.14     Marginal effective rates of corgorate taxation have been higher in
Kenya than in African and Asian countries, stemming from higher statutory
rates (particularly for non-resident branch operations), slower depreciation
rates, lower initial allowances for new investment, and the double taxation
of dividends.   Recent changes in the tax code had generally resulted in
increases of effective rates.   Purthermore, firms borrowing long term in
foreign currency for imported capital goods could not deduct exchange losses
for tax purposes. The Government undertook to complete by June 1988 a study
of comparative marginal effective company tax rates and make appropriate
changes to reduce the rate.  It would also allow, by the same date, com-
panies to treat realized exchange losses on foreign currency loans used to
purchase fixed assets as deductible outlays for tax purposes (PR,
para. 3.19). Complying, the Government reduced the marginal effective com-
pany tax rate from 45Z to 402 and, since January 1, 1989, permits the treat-
ment of foreign exchange losses as a deductible expense (Finance Bill,
1988).
ExNort Financina
3.15     To meet the working capital needs of exporting firms, the Govern-
ment has reactivated the Central Bank's facilitv for rediscounting grivate
financial paper. The facility would allow commercial banks extending pre-
shipment loans to exporters (against confirmed and irrevocable letters of
credit or confirmed and verified export contracts) to rediscount with the
Central Bank the accommodation bill created as a result of this transaction.
Furthermore, the introduction of the scheme would eliminate the penalty rate
applied by the Central Bank in rediscounting private sector financial paper
held by commercial banks.

Export Promotion Proaram
3 16     Support 2roarams for exporters are administered by the Department
of External Trade in the Ministry of Commerce. 17   Other organizations
il&volved in exporter assistance are the Investment Promotion Center (IPC),
the Kenya Bureau of Standards, and the Kenya National Trading Corporation in
th. public domain, and the Kenya Association of Manufacturers and the Kenya
National Chamber of Commerce and Industry in the private sector. But their
involvemanit has been peripheral, erratic and indirect, in part deliberately
so due to bureaucratic rivalries, and the Department of External Trade
remains basically the hub of the exporter assistance program. However, the
effectiveness of the Department of External Trade has been limited as a
bureaucratic approach, coupled with staff and budget constraints, prevented
the development of a fully thought out policy framework, and insufficient
assistance programs (trade fairs, publicity, information, training) to
motivate producers to seek out export markets.  Areas where assistance is
badly needed include: market research and exploration, design and process
know-how, product and packaging re-design, quality control systems, cost
reduction at all phases of production, access to export markets, pre-invest-
ment studies for export projects, establishment of distribution and selling
operations in export markets, and export facilitation equipment.
3.17     Under the ISAC, the Government agreed to design and start imple-
menting by June 1989 a comprehensive medium-term exDort Dromotion program
that would include financing, insurance18 and information support to
potential exporters.  The relevant study was completed, but implementation
of recommendations was delayed with IDA approval until an export promotion
strategy could be developed under the EDP.  Under the latter, with the
exception of information services and publicity, the exporters' assistance
functions of the Department of External Trade would be reduced considerably
in the future. A grant scheme would be established to finance the provision
of consultancy services to exporters from competing private sector sources.
The scheme would be administered by a two-person unit staffed by technical
personnel with experience in export development.  The unit would identify
potential exporters and agree on an export development program with them on
a 50Z-501 cost sharing basis. The grant facility is expected to be run on a
pilot basis for 24 months.  The determination of eligibility criteria for
grant assistance under the scheme, and agreement with IDA on those criteria,
would be conditions of disbursement for funds allocated to this component.
Bilateral donors have expressed interest in cofinancing such firm-level
assistance located in the private sector (EDP, para. 2.40).
17/ Exporter assistance was originally provided by the Kenya Export
Promotion Council founded in 1965. The Council was reconstituted as the
Kenya External Trade Authority (RETA) in 1976, with strong private
sector representation. Following the resignation of the private sector
members of its Board during 1985-87, RETA was absorbed by the Ministry
of Commerce.
18/ The Development Plan 1989-1993 provided for the creation of an ExDort
Credit Insurance *nd Guarantee Scheme, to be set up by a consortium of
local commercial banks and insurance companies (pp. 156, 157). To date,
however, no action has been taken.



- 16 -
3.18     The attraction of individual investors or established foreign firms
with proven technical expertise and marketing channels, prepared to enter
into sub-contracting or licensing arrangements with local producers, or of
consultants with expertise in the design, production, packaging and
marketing of goods in international markets, would greatly facilitate
product development and market penetration. A PPF (1990) provides for the
recruitment of external consultants to assist in the identification and
design of high-quality consumer items based on traditional Kenyan technolo-
gies, and initial results have been encouraging. Also, the EDP is financing
export handling equipment at exit points to remove existing inefficiencies
and improve work force productivity, so that handling charges can be reduced
and exporters enabled to meet the time and quality requirements of foreign
importers (EDP, para. 2.38).
ExDort Processing Zone (EPZ)
3.19     Finally,  the Government was committed to prepare a feseibility
study and establish an EPZ with bilateral assistance, with construction
expected to begin no later than June 1989 (PR, para. 3.14). The study was
initiated, but implementation was delayed due to lack of donor support.
Under EDP, and following the completion of a technico-economic study, IDA
will finance US$17.5 million out of the US$26.5 million projected total cost
for the construction of the first phase of an EPZ at the Athi River near
Nairobi. Construction of the EPZ is expected to begin in June 1991 and be
completed within two years (details in EDP, paras. 2.32-2.37, 3.03).
3.20     The Export Processing Zones Bill, enactel in 1990, established the
Export Processing Zones Authority (EPZA) in which the business community and
the IPC are represented. The EPZA's main objectives are to: advise on the
removal of impediments to, and creation of incentives for, export-oriented
production; regulate and administer approved activities within EPZs; iden-
tify and map areas to be designated as EPZs; plan the development, main-
tenance and finance of the infrastructure of the EPZs; examine, process, and
approve applications for designation of EPZs; examine, process, and approve
applications for licenses by EPZ developers, operators and enterprises;
issue certificates of origin to EPZ enterprises; act as a one-stop center
for channelling applications for EPZ-based firms for permits and facilities
not handled directly by the Authority; enforce within the zone customs
procedures, administrative functions normally performed by local authori-
ties, and foreign exchange control procedures; formulate rules for the
operations of EPZs (e.g., siting of enterprises, activities, movement of
goods).  The organizational structure and administrative rules of the EPZA
are under review.
3.21     Nevertheless, the net longer-term benefits of the EPZs are not
necessarily and always favorable. At the beginning of a country's move from
import-substitution to export-oriented policies EPZs, assuming they are
managed efficiently, can play a useful role through their strong demonstra-
tion effect, particularly in the absence of an export-oriented constituency.
But thwarting their tendency to remain enclaves with few linkages to the
surrounding economy, and ensuring the development of regional centers of
economic activity and the deepening of the industrial structure through
backward linkages, integrated production activities, and technology/skill



- 17 -
transfer to local firms outside the EPZ through comprehensive reforms in the
trade regime remain major challenges. Progressive opening up of the economy
can perhaps be a more cost-effective and less risky way to expand exports
and employment compared to creating costly enclaves. Proliferation of EPZs,
therefore, may not always be warranted, and their establishment should pro-
ceed with circumspection.
C. Regulatory Reform
EnterDrise and Trade Regulations
3.22     Significant disincentives to new investment at the time the ISAC
was initiated included: administrative bottlenecks in establishing a busi-
ness enterprise in Kenya; provisions inimical to foreign investment in the
Foreign Investment Protection Act (FIPA); and restrictions on the activities
of non-resident companies.
3.23     The long list of approvals and clearances required to set up a
business enterprise apparently had deterred potential investors.   The
approval and renewal of work permits for expatriate staff has been a par-
ticularly sensitive issue, long delays have been common, and the grounds for
rejecting applications unclear.  The Government undertook to streamline bz
June 1988 the existing approval procedures by issuing investment guidelines
detailing the policy framework and procedures affecting investors.  Also,
guidelines would be issned to clarify the criteria for obtaining and
renewing work permits, and make the regulations more transparent (PR,
para. 3.18).   The Government complied fully by the stipulated dates.  To
streamline the investment and regulatory approvals process, and to minimize
delays in processing investment applications, the Government established in
1988 a one-stop office in the IPC (Investment Promotion Center Act, 1986),
with some tangible results.   In 1989, a Cabinet Sub-Committee was formed
chaired by the Vice President to provide inter-ministerial coordination in
IPC's effort to eliminate administrative bottlenecks for investment
approvals and simplify licensing procedures.  IPC has been active in pro-
moting joint ventures, and a number of industrial projects are in operation
or in various stages of implementation.   Clarification of the respective
jurisdictions on matters pertaining to investment approvals between the
Treasury, IPC and EPZ would help remove uncertaint4es and frictions. Also,
IPC could benefit by more intensive consultation with, and involvement of,
the local business community.
3.24     Nevertheless,  deficiencies persist in the regulatory regime
affecting foreign and domestic investment, foreign trade, and production for
exports.   There are redundancies in licensing/approval requirements for
operation/expansion of businesses, particularly in the areas of industrial
registration, customs procedures for export, and export licensing (e.g.,
exporters are required to have lice:ases for general trade, for each specific
product, and for each shipment); most licenses and permits must be renewed
annually; and many regulations (e.g., approval and licensing procedures
concerning customs clearance, remittance of profits and royalties, payments
for technology and management contracts) are not administered in a speedy
and transparent fashion (EDP, paras. 2.13, 2.14). Also, the current level
of fees for Customs Bonded Warehouse, Security Bond, inspection, and



- 18 -
licensea are viewed by manufacturers as unjustified; overtime charged for an
array of government officials whose presence for cargo clearance is not
necessary creates an extra financial burden and delays; one Security Bond
should suffice instead of requesting manufacturers to split the bond in
varying amounts for different ports; and manufacturers under bond shculd be
allowed to subcontract among themselves when one has underutilized capacity.
3.25     Under EDP, actions would be taken over the next 24 months to
eliminate redundant licenses and procedures that affect exports, reduce the
frequency of license renewals, and improve the processing and transparency
of existing regulations. Specifically, actions would be initiated to con-
solidate licenses required under the Trade Licensing Act; eliminate restric-
tions on the types of trade and level of distribution of products for
license holders except for a restricted list of products; give enterprises
the option of obtaining licenses with a validity period of up to three
years; reduce the number of restricted products which require prior approval
before export from 38 to 19; eliminate the need for permits for each export
consignment; and implement the changes proposed by IPC to limit the number
of investment approvals to a small number and only for environmental,
health, safety and legal reasons (EDP, para. 2.31).
3.26     Foreign firms operating in Kenya have been facing constraints in
repatriating the sales proceeds of their investments.  FIPA denominated a
company's equity investment in Kenyan shillings, and reinvested profits or
capital gains were not recognized as part of the equity to be remitted on
sale. Moreover, while companies may remit equity investments immediately,
capital gains must be placed in a blocked account earning 21-3Z interest for
five years, and even then be subject to Central Bank approval for transfer
out of the country. The Government would amend PIPA by June 1988 to enable
investors to remit the foreign exchange equivalent of their investment and
to provide commercial returns on funds left in blocked accounts (PR,
para. 3.20).   Complying fully, the Government did amend FIPA.   Equity
investments now can be denominated in foreign currency, and controls
affecting the remittance of capital gains were eased. However, because of
foreign exchange resource constraints, implementation would be phased in
gradually. Although the Government's approach is understandable, given that
automatic approval for remittance of profits and royalties is of major
importance in attracting foreign investors and in encouraging reinvestment
of profits by foreign companies already established in the country, the
current long waiting period, along with other uninviting surrounding
factors, is not likely to stimulate investment. Under EDP, the Government
undertook to formulate, publicize and implement transparent procedures and a
queuing system for repatriation of dividends and royalties by the private
sector over a two-year period (EDP, para. 2.31).
Price Decontrol
3.27     Prices for a wide range of manufactured products are controlled
under the Price Control Act (1956) and its subsequent revisions.  At the
time the ISAC was initiated, the Special Order of the Act applied to about
11 individual consumer items, mainly basic foods and beverages, with the
objective of protecting the purchasing power of low income groups.   The
Gonerol-Order of the Act was originally intended to prevent monopolistic



- 19 -
exploitation and applied to ex-factory prices of 40 manufactured products
across the sector. Producers aubmit cost estimates when they begin produc-
tion of new products, and can apply for subsequent revisions only for input
price changes (cost plus formula).  The system of price controls has been
very inefficient and counter-productive.  Price controls have led to high
cost and low quality products and have protected inefficient firms; the use
of the cost-plus pricing formula has discouraged the Introduction of modern
technology and has hindered efficient production for exportsl because of the
focus on input price changes, improvements in efficiency or changes in the
coat structure are not reflected; the cost of compliance to price control
regulations to firms has been high; and delays in responding to producers'
requests for price increases (up to ten months) and the use of outdated
price information have reduced profitability and new investments in these
industries.19   Finally,  in practice,  the Government enforces  these
regulations primarily on large manufacturers.
3.28     By 1987, the Government had decontrolled some prices, mainly on
basic consumer items.   It had also drafted legislation to monitor mono-
polistic and unfair trade practices as a means of controlling market concen-
tration rather than relying on price controls.  The new legislation, how-
ever, defined monopoly too broadly and provided sweeping powers to the Price
Controller.  Moreover, many of the items covered under the General Order
were inscluded in the import schedules to be liberalized which, under unres-
tricted licensing, would meet sufficient competition from imported goods to
ensure fair pricing.   Finally, many other items encountered substantial
domestic competition making their price controls redundant.
3.29     The Government undertook to quicken the pace of price decontrol.
As a first step, it would decontrol 10 products from the GenerllPrice Order
by June 1988 and a further 10 by December 1988. Purthermore, the Government
proposed to introduce an amendment to the Restrictive Trade Practices,
Monopolies and Price Control Bill, to be enacted by December 1988, to rede-
fine monopoly to reflect market power, and limit the powers of the Price
Controller to items produced under monopoly conditions or traded restric-
tively as defined in the Bill. All controlled items that do not fall under
the new Act would be gradually decontrolled in 1990-1991. The formula for
price determination would be revised from beina cost-based to one based on
import parity. Finally, the Government agreed to process applications for
price revisions of items that will continue to be price controlled, and
conform with the Determination of Costs Order, within 90 dars (PR,
para. 3.16).
3.30     Since the implementation of ISAC, significant progress has been
made in price decontrol. Prices of 20 product categories were decontrolled
in 1988, and currently 18 categories remain controlled under the General
Price Control Order, while 11 others (mostly consumer staples) are subject
to Soecific Price Control Orders. Since 1988, prices of several additional
items within these product categories have been decontrolled, including 76
products since October 1989.  To limit the need to use price controls to
curb market power, the Restrictive Trade Practices, Monopolies and Price
19/ For details see Kenya Association of Manufacturers, Price Controls,
Nairobi, 1988, pp. 41-45.



- 20 -
Control Act was also amended in 1989. However, the provisions of this Act
have yet to be applied systematically to promote competition (PCR,
para. 11).   Price decontrols would be systematically extended during the
period of implementation of the EDP, particularly for potential exportables
and inputs into export industries. Furthermore, import-parity pricing would
be used for items that remain under price control. In view of the Govern-
ment's good record in decontrolling prices and the basic agreement with IDA
on the principles to be applied, the scope and timing of specific price
decontrols would be determined by the Government (EDP, para. 2.31).
D. Public Enterorise Reform
3.31     The ISAC would finance a study that (a) would redefine the role of
the DFIs and develop a plan for their restructuring; and (b) classify indus-
trial parastatals in DFIs' portfolios, especially in the textile, motor
vehicle and steel subsectors, into those in need for rehabilitation and
financial restructuring, those that can be divested, and those that should
be retained. An action program for restructuring arnd divestiture of indus-
trial parastatals would then be prepared, agreed, and announced by December
1988. The Government would then agree with IDA and commence implementation
of the action program before June 1989. For enterprises to be retained in
the public sector, the Government would prepare and implement a monitoring
and supervisory system by December 1988 (PR, para. 3.24).
3.32     After some delay, the study was completed in July 1989,20 an action
program for the two major DEIs -- the Industrial Development Bank (IDB) and
Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation (ICDC) -- was completed in
October 1989, and an IDA Financial Parastatals Technical Assistance Project
for US$6 million was approved in June 1990. With respect to IDB and ICDC,
the evaluation by external consultants established to the Government's
satisfaction their potential viability, and showed a continuing need for the
type of financial services they provide, particularly for medium scale
industry.   The study stressed, that their effectiveness and competitive
position could be enhanced with appropriate policies to ensure independent
management and financial sustainability. The Government prepared a proposal
redefining its strategy toward these institutions to ensure effective
management, commercial operation, and long-term sustainability.   A broad
restructuring plan covering revised mandates, funding, strategy, organiza-
tion and the lending/investment process of these institutions Was completed
in October 1989.   To date, actions have been taken to revise operational
mandates, reconstitute the governing boards, and review staff capabilities
20/ RBC Dominion Securities, Kenvan Develolment Finance Institutions Study,

- 21 -
and needs for IDB and ICDC.21 The Government intends to change the internal
organization of the DFIs to ensure managerial autonomy, improve account-
ability for portfolio management, and institute a competitive and perfor-
mance-oriented incentive mechanism; restructure assets and liabilities
through a phased program of divestiture and consolidation of assets, and
assumption of the foreign exchange risk on their liabilities; initiate cor-
porate workouts among client firms; improve investment and collection prac-
tices; and establish mechanisms to ensure commercial and self-sustaining
operation, including explicit compensation if the DFI. are required to
participate in projects that they would not normally support on commercial
grounds.   Other external donors have been urged to undertake a similar
restructuring of the smaller Development Finance Corporation of Kenya
(DFCK), in which they have majority equity interest.22
3.33     To date, there has been no progress in implementing this array of
measures. Important issues that need to be resolved if the financial health
of the DFls is to be restored have yet to be addressed, and the process of
asset divestiture and DFI restructuring remains in limbo.23 For instance,
the Government has decided to take over the foreign exchange risk on DFI.'
external borrowings, effective July 1. 1989.  Yet, the mechanism for this
take-over has not been communicated to the DFIs. Important issues stemming
from the conversion that need attention include:   date and rate of con-
version of DFIs' loans to projects, losses arising from such conversions,
agreements between DFI., Treasury and external lenders, rescheduling of
DFIs' external liabilities.   Similarly, while the "social projects" to be

and ICDC.
22/ Financial Parastatals Technical Assistance Project, para. 5.
23/ Some parastatals have been targeted for divestiture in 6 to 12 months,
and others in 12 to 36 months.   Of the originally intended subsector
studies (para. 2.03), only the textiles has been completed, but has yet
to be implemented.   The studies on steel and motor vehicles have not
been undertaken. Apparently, divestiture/liquidation in the textile and
sugar subsectors faces strong opposition on ideological grounds. In the
meantime, there have been no initiatives to ease the social impact of
divestitures/liquidations  on the labor force,  e.g.,  retraining,
assistance in finding new jobs, severance payments, unemployment
insurance, transfer of accumulated pension and health benefits.

retained in the public sector and be managed by DIIs as agents of the
Treasury have bean designated, no action has been taken to consummate the
arrangement and relieve the DFIo of their financial burden of servicing
their debts.  Unequivocal rules regarding the relationship between para-
statals and government authorities to ensure autonomy have yet to be estab-
lished.  In the meantime, lending to new projects has been frozen, while
lending for projects considared potentially successful according to the new
criteria would have to be made with funds raised through divestiture. This
suggests that, in effect, DPIo cannot lend pending conclusion of the
restructuring process -- which is bound to be lengthy, as divestiture is
envisaged to be effected through private negotiations, public offers or Unit
Trusts, and such considerations as ability of the financial markets to
absorb the proposed offer, impact of the privatized project on the market
structure, and advisability of prior mergers of uneconomic holdings are to
be taken into account. Purthermore, as most of the parastatals in the DFIs'
portfolio would have to be liquidated, the political dimension present in
parastatal divestitures exacerbates the situation.
3.34     The restructuring of DFIs is critical for maintaining the success
of the adjustment program.   The ability of enterprises to respond to
improvements in the policy environment would be determined in part by the
availability of long-term debt and equity financing, which currently are not
easily available at other financial institutions, and certainly not at DFIs
(paras. 1.09, 3.33).   IDA's Financial Parastatals Technical Assistance
Project would assist in the following areas:  liabilitles manaaement - to
restructure the foreign exchange exposure and domestic liabilities of the
DFIls, and implement appropriate financial provisions; assets management - to
design and implement a divestiture program for assets hold in their port-
folios; onerations management - to assist the DPIl with corporate planning
and all aspects of operations; human resources development - to implement
the personnel policies and develop a training program for staff; systems
manaaomtnt - to design and supervise the implementation of an improved
credit/investment process and aupporting information requirements; corporate

performing enterprises carried on the DII portfolios (Attachment 6).24
E. linancial Sector Reforms
The Policy Package
3.35     As fiscal policy lacks the requisite flexibility and responsiveness
to regulate effectively domestic demand, the availability of a wider range
of monetary policy instruments and a market driven interest rate structure
are necessary to complement fiscal policy, ensure better demand management,
and achieve external balance.  In recent years, the Government has moved
toward greater reliance on market forces in allocating financial resources,
by tendering longer-term Treasury bonds, improving the system for their
auctioning, and introducing other monetary policy instruments.   Although
restrictions on interest rates and quantitative limits on credit persist,
24/ Kenya - Financial Parastatals Technical Assistance Proiect, paras. 6-8;
Attachment 6.



- 23 -
the Government intends to allow increased market determination of interest
rates, and has reduced controls on lending spreads. Under ISAC, the Govern-
ment would take several steps to strengthen the money and capital markets to
provide more flexibility in financial sector policios and support the dives-
titure of industrial public enterprises. Specifically, the Government would
establish a discount facility at the Central Bank by June 1988 to facilitate
open market operations and the development of    asecondary market.  These
measures would also introduce greater flexibility in the interest rate
structure. The Government would also establish a Capital Market. Develop-
ment Authority (CMDA) with appropriate incentives and investor protoction
regulations by June 1989, and strip the CIC of its power over timing *nd
pricing of issues of domestically owned firms, with the ultimate objective
of moving toward market-determined prices for all equities.  A subsequent
financial sector operation (1989) would assist the Government in carrying
this process further (PR, para. 3.26).
Monetarv Polcly Measures
3.36     As an interim measure until full liberalization,  In 1989 the
Government raised the maximum lending rate for commercial bank loans with
maturities over three years to 18S (up from 152).  This, coupled with the
earlier reduction of the maximum lending rate for NBFIs by 1S, led to the
harmonization of interest rates across institutions. It is noteworthy, that
both lending and savings rates have been positive in real terms since 1983
(Attachment 1), and that nominal spreads for commercial banks have increased
from 3Z to 51, thereby providing greater latitude for term transformation
and the pricing of loans to account for the risk element. Also, the Govern-
ment discontinued the practice of lending to some parastatals at below
market rates, and is in the process of defining loan terms for past un-
defined lending, thus ensuring greater transparency.   Furthermore, the
Government is establishing a system for monitoring the performance of para-
statal loans.
3.37     At present, the Government continues to rely primarily on credit
ceilings on private sector credit for monetary control.   This form of
control has 3everal shortcomings   inability to smooth short-term interest
rate volatility, particularly within the inter-bank market; diminished com-
petition between banks, as the credit ceilings are set on a  historical
institutiw--by-institution basis; and credit can contirue to grow in sectors
not govex 4 by the ceilings, such as the NBiFs. The Government intends to
move toward the use of reserve money management and open market operations,
and has already introduced an auction mechanism for Treasury bills and
bonds; has imposed a capital/assets ratio on commercial banks (see
para. 3.40); and has set up a refinance facility in the Central Bank. The
expectation is that credit ceilings will be removed once more effective
control over reserved money has been established. Nevertheless, central to
the success of implementing open market operations will be the liberaliza-
tion of interest rates.   The Government is committed to deregulate the
interest rates by mid-1991.
3.38     The Government proposes to strengthen further the tendering
mechanism for Treasury bills and bonds to make it more market-oriented and



- 24 -
transparent. The measures to be taken include eliminating sales of securi-
ties outside the tender, publishing data on tender results at the close of
the tender, making Treasury bills bearer instruments, and improving coor-
dination between Treasury and the Central Bank on monetary conditions. It
is expected that the use of open market operations will largely rest on
primary market interventions in the near term. To stimulate the development
of secondary markets, the Central Bank is expected to convert part of the
existing Government debt into Treasury bills as a trading portfoiio.  The
Government also plans to improve the refinance facility at the Central Bank.
Although this facility works relatively well at present, it can be used more
flexibly to support monetary policy objectives by varying the discount rate
as appropriate, broadening the definition of eligible paper to include non-
government paper, and developing eligibility guidelines for instruments to
be rediscounted. These measures are also expected to encourage the develop-
ment of private money markets.
Capital Markets Development
3.39     The Capital Markets Authority Act, enacted in 1989, created the
Capital Markets Authority (CHA) with the mandate to foster the development
of all aspects of capital markets, eliminated the powers of the CIC over
domestic share issues, strengthened the regulatory, institutional and promo-
tional framework for the securities industry, and instituted rules to ensure
a more effective operation of the stock exchange.25   The CHA will also
operate a Compensation Fund to protect investors from financial loss arising
from the failure of a licensed broker or dealer to meet his contractual
obligations.
Banking Reaulations
3.40     To instill confidence in the banking system, improve the efficiency
of financial intermediation, and foster prudence and discipline, the Govern-
ment revised the Banking Act.   The Banking Act, 1989, narrows the gap
between classes of institutions, imposes more stringent licensing require-
ments on banks and NBFIs, brings the building societies under the super-
visory control of the Central Bank, establishes the Deposit Protection Fund
(DPF), enables the Central Bank to set guidelines for loan provisioning and
minimum financial disclosure requirements, and increases pena1.ties for
violations of the Banking Act.  Furthermore, the Act enhances the Central
Bank's  ability to advise,  direct and inspect institutions,  set out
reporting, audit and provision requirements, intervene in troubled institu-
tions, establish appropriate capital adequacy requirements and exposure
limits, and limit the payment of dividends. It also sets out the criteria.
minimum capital requirements, and regulations for the establishment of
25/ The EDI, in collaboration with the Capital Markets Authority and the
College of Banking and Finance, organized in Nairobi a seminar on
Financial Markets Development in Eastern and Southern Africa on
September 24-28, 1990, with participation from the countries of the
Region. The topics discussed included organization of capital markets,
investment banking, source of venture capital, privatization, private
and public placements, trading in securities, and the globalization of
capital markets.

financial institutions, including mortgage finance companies, and sets
restrictions on share capital ownership. In 1990, the Central Bank issued
regulations that link capital adequacy requirements to assets (net of provi-
sions, depreciation and write-offs) and require banks and NBFIs to maintain
capital at least 5.52 of assets, including off-balance sheet items, effec-
tive January 1, 1991, and 7.5Z effective January 1, 1992.
Supervision of Financial Institutions
3.41     Despite the high quality of the Central Bank's management and
staff, the effectiveness of supervision has been severely limited by staff
constraints and inadequate information systems.   Many banks had not been
inspected in years and weaker institutions exploited this lack of attention
by flouting banking laws and regulations. Since 1988, and with IDA's assis-
tance,26 the Central Bank began to strengthen its ability to monitor and
supervise the banking systems   it installed a computerized off-site sur-
veillance data system, developed new examination procedures and reporting
requirements, and increased the number of inspections of banks and NBlIs,
particularly those in financial difficulty. The Central Bank has also hired
new staff, streamlined the organizational structure of the Banking Super-
vision Department, and formulated a comprehensive training and staff
development program.   Finally, the Central Bank has developed written
examination and inspection procedures, has instituted appropriate reporting
requirements, provisioning and loan classification guidelines, and is fol-
lowing up closely on the operations and financial condition of the financial
institutions, suggesting remedial actions for the weaker ones.
Restructuring of Institutions in Difficultv
3.42     As already alluded, because of the rapid proliferation of financial
institutions in recent years, the Central Bank has not been able to keep up
with the inspection and monitoring demands of the growing sector. Many of
these institutions have large non-performing assets, resulting from poor
credit policies and internal control mechanisms, excessive concentrations,
inadequate security and loan documentation, and poor follow-up. In some of
these institutions, managers and directors have diverted funds for their own
benefit. As a result, the system now includes a large number of non-viable
institutions with unrecoverable assets, thin or non-existent capital base,
and inadequate liquidity.   As of 1990, over two-thirds of the financial
institutions, accounting for 50% of total assets, had a performance rating
of fair, marginal, or unsatisfactory.    The Financial Sector Adjustment
Credit (1989) supported and assisted in the formulation of a restruc-
turing/liquidation program of banking institutions in financial difficulty
and, as a result, a comprehensive action program for the restructuring of 10
institutions is being implemented. The restructuring process is expected to
be complex and time-consuming. Moreover, the fact that most of the institu-
tions involved are indigenously owned, and that the revitalization of some

of thea may require recapitalization/restructuring of parastatal sub-
borrowers, give. rise to political sensitivities which may render the
restructuring process intractable.
IV. MACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL PERFORMANCE
Recent Stabilizatlon Efforts
4.01     Kenya's efforts to stabilize the economy in recent years have
produced mixed results. While the budget deficit has been reduced consider-
ably since 1987, the level of government *xpendituros remains high. After
dropping sharply in 1988, the growth of money supply accelerated in 1989 and
the economy appears to be overheating. Real GDP growth has stagnated, and
inflation, fueled by a monetary overhang, international price increases,
deprecistion of the shilling, price decontrol, and increases in agricultural
producer prices, has remained above 102 for the past two years -- although,
reportedly, recently the rate is twice as high.  The exchange rate policy
has been appropriate, but the external position has been adversely affected
by deteriorating terms of trade and the poor performance of a number of
major traditional exports, although non-traditional exports performed rela-
tively well. The merchandise export/GDP ratio continued to decline -- fromh
171 in 1980 to 112 in 1989. Imports, although their growth rate decelerated
in recent years, were financed in part through increased external aid.27
The current account deficit rose to 10% of GDP in 1989 excluding grants, or
71 including grants, up from 2.61 and 0.52 retpectively in 1986
(Attachment 1).
4.02     The impact of these economic developments, reinforced by the two-
year backlog of unrepatriated profits and the prevailing political uncer-
tainty, have led to a decline in private investment in the last tvo years or
so, despite the fact that real lending rates have been falling (Attach-
ment 1) .28   In point of fact, there is evidence of significant capital
outflows.   Yet, it is imperative that there be a resurgence of private
investment activity to ensure further growth, reorient existing firms, and
establish new ones for export markets.   Also, since the success of the
reforms introduced by the ISAC is predicated on the effective implementation
of a parallel stabilization program, the partial success of the stabiliza-
tion measures heretofore is likely to affect adversely the sustainability of
the adjustment process. Additional pressures on the balance of payments and

the budget29 are likely to dampen economic growth, necessitate increased
external financing, and ultimately undermine trade reforms.
Industrial Performance
4.03     Real growth in manufacturing decelerated in 1980-85; it picked up
from 1986 on, but by the end of the 1980a it exceeded marginally the 1980
level. It has been sustained by the relatively high capacity utilization of
the traditional subsec;ors and the spurt of some new investment in 1986-88,
contributing 132 to GDP.  The export performance of manufactures has been
even more disappointing. Exports of manufactures have been highly erratic
throughout the 1980s, with a clearly declining trend in nominal (and more so
in real) terms, and a share to total exports hovering around 142 (Attach-
ment 1). Exports of labor-intensive manufactures (e.g., textile., clothing,
footwear and leather products) are relatively low compared to most other
countries of Kenya's level of development and potential, and Kenya's share
of exports to developed countries has been dwindling.  Significantly, the
involvement of small-medium scale enterprises in exports is patently
limited, the major exporters being larger firms and mostly of foreign
origin.
4.04     The poor export performance occurred in the face of considerable
depreciation of the effective exchange rate, substantial slowdown in infla-
tion, declining nominal (and real) wages, and easier access to imported
inputs, foreign exchange and credit as the import requirements of the
exporters were given the highest priority. This suggests, inter alia, per-
sistence of the anti-export bias (Attachment 5), lack of competitiveness on
a cost and/or quality basis, and that the Export Compensation Scheme, aside
from the fact that it is administratively cumbersome, has not fully offset
the increased costs of production due to tariffs and other levies on
imported inputs. More Importantly, as much of the industrial plant is out-
dated, new investment has not been forthcoming (paras. 4.02, 4.05), domes-
tically owned industries have no international links, most of the multi-
national investment has been for the regional market, product quality and
packaging are matters of concern, and the entrepreneurial base is circum-
scribed, the prospects for improving competitiveness and developing the
capability to penetrate export markets are not very encouraging for the
immediate future.
4.05     Real manufacturing Investment has been falling since the late
1970s, except for a short-lived spurt in 1986-88, because of diminishing
opportunities for efficient import substitution, lower domestic demand
during periods of stabilization and drought, and declining exports. Private
now investment followed the same pattern and apparently fell in 1988-90.
ICORs also Increased significantly for most of the 1980s, implying a
decrease in the efficiency of investment. The evidence seems to suggest a
continuad process of disinvestment which, coupled with the aging capital
stock and the disinclination of investors to undertake new projects or

discipline among parastatals, requiring large transfers of funds from
the budget to service their debt obligations.

modernise and expand existing facilities, are hampering industrial growth
and exports. In the same vein, the share of manufacturing in total employ-
ment has been falling constantly -- from 122 in 1980 to 102 in i989. Labor
productivity has also been declining throughout most of the 1980s, largely
reflecting low operating efficiency in a protected environment -- the
resultant of various subsector-specific factors, such as plant scale subop-
timality, overmanning in the public sector,30 and low capacity utilization
affected by vintage equipment, market demand due to stabilization policies,
inadequate management and labor skills, poor maintenance, and unavailability
of inputs and finance (Attachment 1).
V. CREDIT ADMINISTRATION. COORDINATION. AND UTILIZATION
5.01     IDA was instrumental in the design and implementation of the
reforms undertaken by the Government.  In particular, earlier economic and
sector work helped to focus attention on areas where significant change was
needed, to define technical and policy options, and to translate adjustment
strategy into mutually consistent and actionable programs.  IDA's involve-
ment and support helped articulate the arguments for structural adjustment,
deepen the dialogue on technical issues, and ease external constraints,
heightened by political uncertainties, by improving access to concessionary
financing. Frequent exchanges were helpful in maintaining the momentum of
reform and in collaborative problem solving (for details see PCR,
paras. 22-25). IDA's supervision effort was close and effective.
5.02     Conditionality and tranching, coordination with IMF, and procure-
ment and disbursement procedures are detailed in the PCR, paras. 17-21. The
conditions were formulated through a process of constructive dialogue and
close collaboration with the Government to the end of ensuring commonality
of purpose, cooperation, and institutional commitment and support. Condi-
tionality aimed at facilitating the implementation of prerequisite steps
(such as preparation special studies), or was supportive of forthcoming
initiatives (e.g., trade liberalization, public enterprise reform).   The
conditions were germane to the objectikes and actions agreed upon, logically
sequenced, and performance-oriented, i.e. tranching or disbursement was
conditioned on completion of specific tasks within agreed timetables. The
timetables were based on the scope and priority of the issues at hand and,
in general, were realistic. With few exceptions, the Government complied
fully.  Tranche release conditions referred to distinct ard complementary
areas, involved several ministries and agencies, and generally were imple-
mentable although, at times, the capacity of the implementing entities inad-
vertently may have been stretched.   Nonetheless, delays in initiating
certain actions (e.g., import licensing, divestiture of parastatals), should
rather be attributed to the centralization of the economic decision-making
power, uncertainty over the potential impact of particular measures, or lack
of consensus between the economic and political leadership.
30/ Between 1980 and 1989, manufacturing employment in the public sector
increased by 492, whereas in the private sector by 282, hardly justified
by the level of investment.



- 29 -
5.03     The reforms initiated under the ISAC were an integral part of the
stabilization and structural adjustment package supported by the IMF, and
were also supported by several bilateral and multilateral donors (see
Preface).   Procurement procedures were satisfactory and in line with Bank
guidelines. The Credit was disbursed on schedule, and an estimated 701 of
the funds financed the import of raw materials. The counterpart funds were
made available to the Government without restriction, and were used to sup-
plement its budget.
VI. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCCME
6.01     The reform package under ISAC represents a practical program for
industrial structural adjustment.  The thrust of the strategy, the objec-
tives, and the supportive policy instruments were appropriate. The direc-
tion, sequencing, pace, and timing of trade liberalization measures,
including the complementary initiatives involving the divestiture of para-
statals, improvement of the incentive structure, and financial market
reforms, were correct. The action programs were well-conceived, were pur-
posefully designed, and addressed priority issues. Actions to be taken were
spelled out in considerable detail, thereby facilitating the monitoring of
time-bound programs.   Conditionality and tranching were germane to the
objectives and actions agreed, performance-oriented, sensible, and effective
in eliciting compliance.   Conditionality, although comprehensive, was not
excessive in the face of the task at hand (para. 5.02).
6.02     On the whole, progress in imDlementina the reform program has been
satisfactory in virtually all areas and the main objectives, viewed as a
time slice of a longer process, were largely achieved. Significantly, the
momentum of industrial, financial, and trade sector adjustment has been
carried on by the implementation of further reforms initiated by follow-on
operations in 1989 and 1990, reflecting the Government's strong commitment
to the adjustment effort.  Legislative initiatives were taken to establish
the legal framework for institution building. During this phase of import
liberalization, emphasis was given to enhancing the transparency of protec-
tion by replacing QRs on competing imports with tariffs and liberalizing the
licensing of imports.   Most specific duties have been replaced with ad
valorem rates, and rates have been revised to ensure comparable treatment of
similar products.   The number of tariff categories was reduced, initial
steps were taken to lower average tariffs, and there is greater reliance on
tariffs as the main instrument of protection.   But, while rates on non-
competing imports have come down, due to reclassification of items among
schedules and the cascading structure of nominal tariffs, effective protec-
tion and tariff dispersion on competing imports have somewhat increased
(paras. 3.03, 3.06).  Also, because of the high degree of administrative
discretion, arbitrary ad hoc exemptions remain a vexing issue encouraging
favoritism and increasing variability in protection.
6.03     The imnort licensinR system has become more transDarent and
efficient.   In the circumstances, the delay in completing the automatic
licensing to imports competing with vulnerable domestic industries until



- 30 -
June 1991 appears justifiable. Nonetheleos, overall the imports regime has
become less restrictive, albeit in the absence of hard data the part of the
import demand due to the liberalization effort cannot be singled out from
the nominal import growth. Tangible progress has been made in the areas of
investment incentives (e.g., enterpriee regul-tory framework) and price
decontrol, although important commodities remain unaffected creating a dis-
incentive to investment (par-a. 3.22-3.30). By strengthening the system of
export incentives (paras. 3.10-3.20), ISAC also introduced a first set of
actions to reduce the anti-export bias in the industrial and trade policy
regime. Finally, virtually all studies were commissioned and completed.
6.04     Although claims of anomalies in the tariff structure (para. 3.08)
and unfair competition by threatened local manufacturers (e.g., lower import
duty for finished products than inputs, under-declaration of landed value of
imported items to evade payment of the full duty, illegal imports, dumping)
need to be considered, strenathening customs administration is also a matter
of priority.  Notwithstanding the transparency issue, the matter deserves
attention as one objective of the conversion of QRs into tariffs is the
expectation to raise revenue -- which is defeated if collection is prob-
lematic.  Moreover, tariff reform (lowering of rates and reducing disper-
sion) intended to reduce the anti-export bias and promote an outward-
oriented development strategy cannot be viable if revenue cannot be
collected to offset revenue losses.  The trade-off between liberalization
and fiscal imperatives cannot be ignored in a tariff reform effort.
Furthermore, because of its distortive effects, ad hoc duty exemptions steps
need to be taken for their abolition (para. 3.07).
6.05     Despite the tangible progress in improving export incentives
(paras. 3.12-3.21), the anti-export bias persists (para. 4.04).  However,
the export development program that followed on (1990) deepens and extends
trade policy reforms initiated under ISAC.   Specifically, the EDP would
complete the conversion of QRs into tariffs, further reduce tariffs on non-
competing imports, initiate tariff reductions on Imports that compete with
domestic production, and reduce the dispersion of effective protection,
thereby providing continuity in the adjustment process. The EDP supplements
the ISAC with additional direct measures which would encourage an export
supply responsoe and increase the neutrality of the trade regime.  To this
end, incentives would be reoriented to enhance the profitability of non-
traditional exports through appropriate exchange rate management and
improved access for exporters to inputs at international prices, and com-
press profits in highly protected Import-substitution activities through
continued liberalization of imports (para. 3.091 EDP, paras. 2.23, 2.24).
6.06     The Government also moved vigorously in the financial sector,
taking an array of measures to activate the money and capital markets.
Meaosures implemented to date in the sector lncludet   passage of a new
Banking Act which improves the legal framework for the regulation of finan-
cial institutione; strengthened prudential supervision by the Central Bank;
improvements in monetary programuing and the use of indirect monetary policy
instruments; restructuring of several insolvent financial institutions;
harmonization of interest rates across financial institutions; and main-
tenance of positive real savings and lending rates (parso. 3.36-3.42). The



- 31 -
financial sector reform program, also initiated following th; ISAC (1989),
supports wide-ranging policy and institutional reforms, extending and com-
plementing reforms launched under ISAC.  Policy reforms include interest
rate liberalization, more active use of generalized policy instruments,
reductions in fiscal deficit, rovision of banking regulation, improved
fundamental supervision of the banking industry, and strengthening of the
regulatory and incentive framework for capital markets development. Insti-
tutional reforms include tbe restructuring of banks and NMils in financial
difficulties to strengthr,n the Zinancial ystem and improve the efficiency
of financial intermedistion.   However, restructuring of ailing banking
institutions in itself is a drawn-out and complex process. Moreover, most
of the institutions to be wound down or restructured are indigenous-owned,
while the restructuring of some institutions would also require the
liquidation or restructuring of parastatals -- areas that remain politically
sensitive.
6.07     While significant steps have been taken to formulate an action plan
for the restructuring of DPIs, including a classification of the parastatals
in their portfolio (successful, unsuccessful, potentially successful, social
projects), to date no progress has been made in initiating the process of
divestiture and liquidation.   In this regard, it is important that the
Government face up to the inexorable reality that micro-management is beyond
the Government's capacity, and that obsolete, sub-optimal and otherwise
uneconomic units ultimately would have to be phased out.  And since the
restructuring of DPIs is bound up with the rehabilitation of their portfolio
(weeding out unviable parastatals, resolving the issue of the denominated in
foreign currencies debt, financial restructuring, etc.), delays in the
divestiture process and in the assumption of the obligations of the "social
projects" by the Treasury imply delays in ascertaining the true financial
condition of the DPI. and the magnitude of the capital injection required to
ensure their austainability, while it prolongis the DPIs' inability to resume
lending (para. 3.33).  Also, restructuring of DPIe would be meaningless if
funds for recapitalization and new operations are not available -- which is
an open question.   In this regard, perhaps it is not too late for the
Government to consider merging IDB and ICDC, as the benefits of their co-
existence are far from apparent in the face of the present financial market
structure (DFCK and commercial banks). Consolidation of the activities of
the two institutions would result in a stronger, leaner and more cost-effec-
tive entity, while the costs of institution building (para. 3.34) could be
minimized.  Development banking could be better served by a single strong
institution than by two smaller and weaker ones, by virtue of its greater
capacity for resource mobilization, stronger competitive position vis-a-vis
the commercial banks, and greater versatility.
6.08     The policy of increaeing African-Kenyan participation through state
ownership of industry while often discouraging Asian-Kenyan and multi-
national private sector development has not been successful in the past.
Many public investments have fared badly, the private sector has been dis-
investing since 1979 and, most importantly, small African-Kenyan enterprises
have not grown. The alternative, as outlined in the Sessional Paper, is to
divest public enterprises, increase African-Kenyan participation in a
growing private sector, and provide policy support for entrepreneurship



- 32 -
development.  To this end, while encouraging joint ventures with African-
Kenyans wherever possible and promoting African-Kenyan entrepreneurial
development at the informal micro-enterprise and small-scale levels are
steps in the right direction, indigenization of large, well-established non-
African-owned private companies would hardly be advisable. In the same
vein, If the implicit objective in the divestiture of industrial parastatale
is to ensure indigenous ownership, the purpose will be self-defeating and
the task impossible.
6.09     The lack of a policy framework delineating the circumstances under
which parastatals would be the preferred vehicle to private sector entities
for carrying out particular industrial activities;31 lack of consensus among
the political leadership on the issue of divestiture of parastatals, rein-
forced by lingering suspicion of the non-indigenous private sector; concern
about transparency in the valuation of assets and funding, concentration of
economic power, and labor lay-offs as a consequence of the divestiture
process; and opposition from vested interests adversely affected, have con-
tributed significantly to the very slow pace in dealing with financially
troubled parastatals.  Aside from the continued drain on the budget, such
delays will inevitably lead to further capital erosion, poor utilization of
valuable assets, and increased rehabilitation and financial restructuring
requirements making the companies harder to dispose of. Furthermore, in the
face of a thinning capital base, the question of indigenous ownership
becomes less relevant.
6.10     The effectiveness and outcome of the reforms are conditioned on the
Government's ability to develop and effectively use proper policy instru-
ments to maintain internal and external balances; the investors' response to
the incentives by undertaking new investment and exports; the ability of
existing manufacturing enterprises to adjust fairly quickly to import com-
petition; and the Government's access to external funding to bridge the
external resource gap in the face of the slow export growth and faster
rising imports at the initial stage.   The latter, understandably, would
depend on maintaining sound macroeconomic management and on sustaining the
adjustment effort.  Since the implementation of the policy reform package
has been recent and the scope of some measures is being deepened, extended
or complemented by follow-on initiatives, the impact of the reforms intro-
duced by ISAC cannot be fully assessed at this juncture. To date, in the
face of an uninviting investment climate and binding constraints, potential
investors maintain a wait and see attitude, and the anticipated increases in
manufacturing investment and exports have yet to manifest themselves (see
also paras. 7.01-7.03).
31/ Neither the State Corporation Action, 1986 (as amended in 1990), which
provides the legal framework for state control of wholly owned
parastatals, nor any other document, sets out clearly a policy for state
livolvement in the productive sectors.

VII. SUSTAIR&BILITY OF TAE ADJUSTMENT EFFORT
7.01     Although the political commitment to a continued adjustment effort
remains strong, the instituted economic policy measures have yet to create
conditions conducive to sustained investment and export growth. As alluded
in para. 6.j0, the effectiveness and sustainability of the package of policy
reforms depend critically on a positive response from the private sector,
reflected in new industrial investments and a rapid growth of non-tradi-
tional exports (see also PCR, para. 31).  So far, the private sector has
been apathetic and unresponsive to the new measures. If anything, manufac-
turing investment continues to decline and there is evidence of capital
outflows, reflecting nagging concerns by potential investors and an unin-
viting investment climate. As a result, the sustainability of the overall
adjustment effort at this juncture remains uncertain.
7.02     The entire investment and export effort is further constrained by
the narrow supply of indigenous entrepreneurship and, perforce, the reliance
on foreign investors.   The promotion and reorientation of non-traditional
exports toward new products and markets is inherently a difficult and pro-
tracted process. The existence of excess capacity in particular subsectors
does not necessarily ensure that it could be used to produce for foreign
markets because of lack of competitiveness emanating from outdated tech-
nology, inefficient production and quality considerations, and lack of
market contacts. In some instances, restrictive land use regulations hamper
new investment for expansion of processed agricultural exports.   Most
licensing and patent agrestents of franchised firms (subsidiaries of multi-
nationals or local firms with foreign franchises) are restrictive in nature
which suggests that, even if the licensees had the capacity, they are pre-
cluded from exporting to countries outside a certain country or region.
Traditionally, many firms are inclined to start exporting only after they
have established a foothold in the domestic market, viewing exports as a
residual.  Supply constraints emanating from the inadequate production and
irregular flow of agricultural inputs, shortages of skilled manpower, poor
condition of much plant and equipment, unavailability of term financing, and
poor infrastructure maintenance exacerbate the situation. Labor costs are
not necessarily low by the standards of other developing countries, particu-
larly in the face of declining labor productivity. Finally, it takes time
to build new capacity and develop new export markets, particularly in the
difficult to penetrate industrially advanced countries. The actual perfor-
mance of non-traditional exports during the late 19809 reflects the force of
these binding constraints and suggests that the original optimism is not
unwarranted.
7.03     The maintenance of macroeconomic stability is also crucial for the
success of the reforms undertaken. The rising budgetary and current account
deficits and the escalating inflationary pressures in the past two years,
coupled with the wide perception of an uninviting investment climate, are
matters of concern, as the lack of supportive macroeconomic policies could
stall, if not reverse, the implementation of the trade liberalization
program, seriously undermining its effectiveness and sustainability.
Furthermore, unless arrested early on through adept demand management
policies, such untoward developments could cast doubt on the Government's



- 34 -
comitment to the adjustment effort and sap its credibility. High and sus-
tained budget deficits tend to drive up interest rates, crowd out the
private sector and fuel inflation, undermining the Government's effort to
improve the functioning of the financial system in supporting production and
investment.  Inflationary pressures, leading to devaluations and increases
in interest rates, raise the cost of funds and equipment and tend to die-
courage new investment, thereby negating the intended benefits of the reform
program. Moreover, recent political eventc point to the need for greater
attention to effective governance. There is a perception that steps need to
be taken to improve the transparency and accountability of the decision-
making and resource allocation processes, and that risk taking should be
adequately rewarded. Finally, concentration of economic and political power
could severely constrain the development prospects of the industrial sector,
by adversely effecting the use of public resources and the willingness of
the private sector, both foreign and domestic, to make longer-term invest-
ment cwumitments.
7.04     Kenya's economic recovery remains fragile.  Because of the lack of
growth and diversificatiol ot non-traditional exports, the economy has
relied excessively on foreign resources to finance imports and the budget
deficit and has become vulnerable to external shocks.   Unless corrected,
macroeconom'c imbalances threaten to undermine recent economic and stabili-
zation gains.   Currently, a constituency that supports promotion of non-
traditional exports, as opposed to manufacture of import substitutes, is
merely nascent and needs to be developed. Policy reforms, while necessary,
would not by themselves be sufficient to remove constraints to efficient
production and exports, such as the supply of entrepreneurship and the
attitude toward developing new products for export. The gains to be derived
from an export-oriented strategy, compared to the costs inflicted by the
liberalization measures, would have to become visible -- which takes time
and propitious conditions. Moreover, to make policy reforms more effective
and sustainable, actions are required to draw small and medium firms into
the export effort, few of which are owned by Kenyan-Africans.   Since the
expansion of foreign exchange earnings from the adoption of an export-
oriented strategy will take considerable time, to sustain the import
liberalization effort, inflows of quick-disbursing external funds will
continue to be required. But access to external resources would depend on
sound macroeconomic management (para. 6.10).
7.05     The Government's specific aims for 1990-92 are to attain output
growth of over SZ; reduce inflation by 1992 to the level forecast for
Kenya's trading partners (about 52) compared with 102 in 1989; and reduce
the external current account deficit to a sustainable level of 3.62 of GDP
by 1992 (from 6.92 in 1989).  To achieve these objectives, the Government
intends to:  reduce the budget deficit to levels that can be sustained by
foreign and non-inflationary domestic financing, and do not crowd out the
private sector; limit the use of new non-concessional sources of external
financings pursue an exchange rate policy that, in addition to complementing
liberalization in the trade regime, promotes sustained export-led growth;
reorient trade and industrial incentives to reduce anti-export bias,
encourage efficiency, promote the growth of non-traditional exports and
encourage domestic and foreign investment; and rationalize the budget by
limiting public sector employment and improving the quality and implementa-
tion of the public sector investment program. Economic performance in 1990



- 35 -
(p-ra.. 4.01, 4.02) has made the achievement of these objectives more dif-
ficult, and suggests the need to pursue more aggressive demand management
policie, to ensure consistency between the macroeconomic framework (and
external financin,3) and the import liberalization prc"ram.  The willingness
of the Government to commit itself to a now set of adjustment-related condi-
tions under follow-on operations is encouraging, in that it enhancee the
prospects of sustaining the progress already achieved and consolidating the
momentum of the adjustment process.
VIII. LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01     The review of the experience with the ISAC, including the circum-
stances that led to its sanction, offers instructive lessons and suggestions
that may provide a better defined framework for shaping the Bank's posture
and approach to country macroeconomic and sectoral issues (see also PCR,
para. 32).
8.02     The experience with the conceptualization of nolicv reforms affirms
the following conclusions.
(i) Policy-based, sector-specific lending can be a convenient
vehicle for pursuing an open dialogue with the Government on
broader and more complex institutional and policy issues.
However, the crucial element in the successful implementation
of well-designed action programs is a strong oolitical will.
broad consensus. and unwavering commitment on the part of the
policy-makers, and the active involvement and support of
highly motivated technocrats in core economic ministries and
agencies.  Furthermore, agreed upon reforms need to be fol-
lowed through and sustained. Well thought out proposals and
convincing arguments, consistency in approach, and a firm Bank
(and donor) stance on policy reforms are likely to reassure
irresolute decision-makers, and ensure more effective imple-
mentation and sustainability of the adjustment effort.
(ii)  There is areater likelihood that Policy reforms will be suc-
cessful and sustained if the grocess of Policy formulation is
internalized, in the sense that sector reforms are initiated,
formulated and implemented through institutional processes and
mechanisms originating within the country and integrated in
its industrial development program, than if reforms emerge
from the exercise of external leverage. The Bank can facili-
tate the process by helping to focus attention on areas where
significant change is needed, drawing on its economic and
sector work; to define technical and policy options; and to
translate the adjustment strategy into mutually consistent
actionable programs.



- 36 -
(iii)  A discriminating aRproach to structural adjustment should be
followed concernina areas of intervention.  Although there
might be advantages in endorsing an omnibus program, involve-
ment should be limited to a more select subset of sector-
specific measures for which Bank policy support would be most
important and needed, and where the Bank's technical inputs
are most likely to make a critical difference. Also, a more
narrowlv focussed sectoral gdiustment program is likoly to be
more effectively imnlemented and more easi_ly suoervised and
monitored.
(iv)  A successful stabilization Protram provides the requisite
economic and nolitical environment for a more effective imple-
mentation of industrial and trade adjustment measures.   In
this regard, close coordination and collaboration vith the IMF
ensures consistency of advice and enhances substantially the
chances of successful design and implementation of programs of
structural change, given the complementarity and mutually
reinforcing nature between stabilization and adjustment
policies.
(v) Reduction of the country's denendence on imoort duties and
taxes for revenue could enhance substantially the sustain-
ability of trade policy reforms.   However, this requires
parallel tax reforms and strengthening of the tax administra-
tion capability.
(vi) To be effective. management of the foreign exchange rate needs
to be backed uR by disciRlined demand management golicies.
(vii) The effectiveness of trade reforms could be strengthened when
accompanied by rewulatorv/institutional reforms in the finan-
cial, industrial, and other related sectors, as well as by
efforts to develop the physical and human capital infrastruc-
ture.  Moreover, bold groarams of trade liberalization prob-
ably have a better chance of endurina than do weak or tenta-
tive oroarams.  This is likely to be all the more true in a
country that has a precedent of trade restrictions or has made
earlier unsuccessful attemots at reform.
8.03     The experience with the design of action oroxrams yields some
interesting insights.
(i) The effectiveness of action oroarams is enhanced if they are
commensurate with the imolementation caoacitv of ministries
and agencies concerned, and they embody a reasonable element
of flexibility insofar as the means of purauing agreed ends
are concerned, to permit adjustments during implementation
that would accommodate unforeseen constraints and provide
latitude to the Government to decide the politically feasible
timing for the introduction of policy changes.



- 37 -
(ii) Institution building is as important as the transfer of
resources and extension of technical assistance; but it is a
particularly difficult and drawn out process, and commitment,
patience, and perseverance are required to achieve long-
lasting results.  Moreover, sustainability of effort is cru-
cial in solidifying the progress already achieved.
(iii) To alleviate the socio-economic renercussions of certain
measures enforced under restructuring programs, it would be
exoedient to identify early on in the design process gar-
ticular grouRs/industries in need for special assistance, and
to ensure that such assistance would be forthcoming for a
transitional period.
(iv) Conditio is should strike and reinforce a practicable balance
between trade nolicy and macroeconomic stabilization and regu-
latorv reforms. Furthermore, conditions are more llkely to be
met when the borrower has a sense of ownership of the reforms,
and the program is designed to take account of country-
specific circumstances.
(v) Undertakings should be purposeful. Rrecisely defined, and
performance-oriented, and compliance should be closely moni-
tored, if they are to serve the intent for which they have
been stipulated.   Tranching, in particular, if formulated in
broad terms, allows for an elastic assessment of actual per-
formance thereby defeating its purpose.
(vi) Conditionality is no substitute for Political. administrative.
and private sector supDort of the RroRosed reforms. Consensus
building should begin with operationally oriented economic and
sector work and reinforced through a close policy dialogue.
(vii) Policy-oriented economic and sector work is of critical impor-
tance in appreciating the modus ooerandi of key economic and
institutional parameters, in identifying deficiencies in per-
formance, institutional structures end policies, and in en-
hancing the Bank's (and the Borrower's) capability to design
workable policy reforms and purposeful and action-specific
programs. Moreover, a deep understanding and appreciation of
the cultural background, political realities, institutional
arrangements, attitudes and, more generally, of the way deci-
sions are taken and implemented in a country can lead to less
dogmatic approaches to institutional and policy reforms and
more practicable solutions and conditionality.
8.04     The experience with the effectiveness of external financial assis-
tance leads to the following observations.
(i) External assistance can be helpful in promoting reform when it
is conceived and presented as a reinforcing aaent and as a
means of reducint the cost of reforms to which the policy-
makers in the recipient country are already committed. Aid is



- 38 -
likely to be self-defeating if it is proffered *s * quid oro
gu for the reform cosmitment itself.
(ii)  Only those forms of aid that have the effect of changing eco-
nomic, social and organizational structures can provide essen-
tial benefits to the recipient. External assistance therefore
should be circumspect and discrete to avold thartinu govern-
ment efforts to address oreasian econgD4c and sector isues by
grovidina a convenient cushion.   Furthermore, by acting in
concert, donors can ensure congruity of purpose, consistency
in policy reforms, coordination of the total effort and
synchronization of actions, prevent the transmission of con-
flicting signals, a*id avoid duplication and dissipation of
effort.
8.35     The experience with actions that addressed specific issues on para-
statal performagnce provides useful insights on a number of issues.
(i)  There is no inherent reason whv narastatals cannot be as
dynamic and efficient as privatelv owned entarorises.   But
this can happen only if thev are run by qualified manaaers who
are allowed the requisite dearee of autonomy in decision-
makint and operate under commercial grinciples in a market-
oriented environment.   In practice, however, and with few
exceptions, state-controlled industrial enterprises and finan-
cial intermediaries suffer from intrusive political interven-
tions, the appointment of unqualified top executives and board
members, poor staff compensation and Inadequate reward of high
performers, and the difficulties imposed by a variety of
social tasks often thrust upon them (e.g., overmanning) that
distort their behavioral pattern. Such encroachments on mana-
gerial autonomy reflect narrow, if not self-serving, percep-
tione of their role by the political leadership.   Institu-
tional inertie and lack of receptivity, reinforced by a weak
policy framework, tend to further stultify progress in
developing sound parastatals and financial intermediaries.
(ii)  Where the institution of oublic enterDrise is viewed as ser-
viceable. to Preserve its lndeoendence. it is imperative that
unequivocal rules be established remardint the relationshil
between narastatals and the government authorities concerned.
and such understandinas should be adhered to.   Parastatals
should have clear objectives, and be assured of a degree of
autonomy sufficient to enable them to make management deci-
sions free from political pressures.   At the same time, a
well-designed system of ex Rost accountability, as opposed to
ex ants controls, should be instituted for each sector based
on appropriate indicators to monitor and assess their perfor-
mance.  If such elemental conditions cannot be assured, the
implication is that state awnerehip is not a workable option
and privatization may be the only viable alternative.
(iii) Given that the composition, quality, continuity and modus
overandi of the Board of Directors of a narastatal greatly



- 39 -
affect the *nter,rise's *ffectiveness and 2erformance, due
attention should be paid during oelection to the qualifica-
tions, experience, non-allegiance to special interests, and
diversity (e.-g, in terms of affiliation, skills, background)
of the appointees to enable the Board to provide guidance free
of self-serving influence and ensure impartial decision-taking
based on strictly comercial principles.
(iv)  It is extremely difficult to reoreanize. let alone dismantle,
unessential moribund entities and enterprises in the ipublic
domain because of the resistance of entrenched bureaucracies
and a concerned labor force. The situation is exacerbated in
the absence of a policy framework delineating the circum-
stances under which parastatals are the preferred vehicle for
carrying out particular industrial activities; when the
political leadership is unable to reach a consensus on this
issue; when there is lingering suspicion of the non-indigenous
private sector and the implicit objective of divestiture is to
ensure indigenous ownership; and when there is vacillating
concern about the transparency of asset valuation and funding,
concentration of economic power, and social repercussions.
8.06     The experience with the ISAC in the financial sector is particularly
instructive.
(i) Poor organization. weak manatement. abuse of existing institu-
tional arrangements, and iniudicious financial Policies hamper
the ability of the financial institutions to cater effectively
and equitably to the legitimate needs of their clientele, and
foster untoward lender and borrower behavior.
(ii) Reca2italization without solid Progress in rectifying the
oolicv environment, in revamoing the organizational structure
and ooeratina orocedureslgractices of the institutions, and in
desisting from external interventions affecting management
decisions, is unlikely to foster the develo2ment of sound
financial intermediaries
(iii) The experience seems to suggest that a financial intermedi-
ary's sustainabilitv is organically conditioned on an array of
impacting internal and external factors, including:   concep-
tion (e.g., prospective role, market share, and strength of
competition); human resource development, including a com-
petent, dynamic and resourceful management team and board;
degree of independence in decision-making, more the outcome of
the government's perception of the intermediary's role, the
absence of intrusive external interventions, and the institu-
tion of an effective defense mechanism rather than the form of
ownership; development of an appropriate organizational struc-
ture, systems and procedures, work methods, and a balanced
structure of operationsa ability to operate on sound banking
principles and financial discipline; rational selection of
projects based on thorough appraisals and close supervision of



- 40 -
the projects financed; conducive economic environment, policy
framework, and institutional arrangements (e.g., economic
policy framework, regulatory apparatus, legal system)
allowing for business-like sub-borrower conduct and perfor-
mance, the development of a healthy portfolio, adequate
returns on the financial resources employed, and ability to
mobilize resources; adaptability to changing economic condi-
tions and shifting parameters; and judicious guidance/crver-
sight by creditors, financial authorities, and parent
ministries.
(iv) More than lip service must be paid by financial intermediaries
to establishing the economic merit of subtroiects.  Economic
rates of return need to be calculated at a very early stage of
project appraisal, if they are to serve as a management tool
for guiding project selection or for improving project design
(e.g., by identifying potential economies of scope; ascer-
taining the optimal plant scale in the face of alternative
technologies and skill mix, product mix, degree of product
standardization, and production runs; types, degree of pro-
cessing and sourcing of inputs; plant location; balance
between the different processes of a unified operation). Yet,
DFIs in Kenya apparently remained unconvinced that this
vetting technir..Ae can add measurably to the effectiveness of
their decision-making process; or perhaps they do not fully
appreciate the need for establishing the economic efficiency
of their investments in environments where external and
internal competition is the exception and distortions in key
parameters are prevalent.
8.07     Attempts to streamline the imvorts control reaime and to devise
arrangements to Promote manufacturint exports yield some interesting
insights.
(i) Restrictive import policies, and the attendant reliance on
administrative regulations and controls to ensure their effec-
tiveness, tend to affect adversely production and resource
allocation, are oRen to abuse. take a heavy toll on the coun-
try's scarce administrative resources. and foster rent-seekina
entrepreneurshiD. As a result, such policies should be used
sparinigly and only as an interim expediency until a rational
tariff structure and a well-designed incentive system can be
put in place.
(ii) The speed with which QRs and import licensing should be elimi-
nated depends on the ability of those sectors likely to be
subjected to increased competitive pressure to adjust. Never-
theless, there is a trade-off:   the longer the competitive
pressure is delayed, the more time highly protected firms are
afforded to adjust; but, at the same time, adjustment is
likely to meet with resistance and become more difficult,
potentially compromising the benefits from liberalization. A
thoughtfully spaced out timetable for the elimination of QRs,



- 41 -
coupled with a transitional mechanism to facilitate adjustment
to a market-based system of foreign exchange allocation, would
send a strong signal and ensure that the trade reform com-
mences with credibility. Conversely, protracted delays would
enable existing vested interests to lobby for abandoning the
reform.
(iii) The pace of import liberalization and sectoral adiustments is
conditioned basically on *xoort performance. as affected both
by domestic and external economic developments. The existence
of a transparent rationale for instituting an export incen-
tives scheme is very important.  Incentives should basically
be compensatory in nature, counterbalancing discriminatory
domestic levies and/or equalizing advantages of competitors
due to subsidies, and should not aim at making up for produc-
tion inefficiencies. On the other hand, the effectiveness and
serviceability of well-conceived incentives can be easily
stultified by poor implementation practices.
(iv) The strong link between an efficient production substructure
and export Potential. in view of the constraining effects of
sUgplY inelasticities in the short, and even the medium term,
should be duly a22reciated in efforts to stimulate exnort
erowth. This in turn suggests the importance of macroeconomic
stability to maintain investor confidence; the institution of
an appropriate policy of foreign exchange rate management; and
the creation of an institutional and incentive framework con-
ducive to industrial investment that would broaden the coun-
try's export base, including a system of export incentives
that encourages backward integration.
(v) The net lonter-term benefits of the exvort promotion zones
(EPZs) are not necessarill or always favorable.   At the
beginning of a country's move from import substitution to
export-oriented policies EPZs, assuming they are managed
efficiently, can play a useful role through their strong
demonstration effect.   However, EPZs often tend to remain
enclaves with few linkages to the surrounding economy.
Comprehensive trade reforms aiming at the liberalization of
the economy can perhaps be a more cost-effective and less
risky way to deepen the industrial structure and expand
exports and employment.   Establishment of EPZs, therefore,
should proceed with circumspection.
(vi) Reform of export procedures and documentation can be dis-
tressingly slow in their imnlementation, as it affects deep-
rooted attitudes and vested interests, sntails far-reaching
changes in the internal procedures of agencies involved and
the flow of documents, necessitates the establishment of new
controlling mechanisms, and requires the development of inter-
agency trust.



- 42 -
(vii)  lhe iromotion and reorientation of non-traditional exoort
toward new products and markets is a difficult and 2rotracted
pMGMe *
(viii) Since the expansion of foreign exchango earnings from the
adoption of an export-oriented strategy will take considdrable
time, to sustain the import liberalization effort, inflow 21
puick-disbursing external funds will continue to be reauired.
Understandably, access to external resources would depend on
sound macroeconomic management.

Is  In computing the effective duty on imports, only tariff protection is considered because
comprehensive and reliable estimates are not available for the tariff equivalents of QRs due to
import licensing. While the intensity of such QRs on imports since 1980 has varied according to
the availability of foreign exchange, their inclusion would significantly increase the effective
import duty, and the level of anti-export bias, but is unlikely to affect their trends. Since
the impact of HUB has been minimal, the subsidy to exports includes only export compensation
payments.
lb  The anti-export bias beasures the relative profitability, in terms of Kenyan Shillings, of
producing a dollar's worth of an import-substitute compared to a dollar's worth of an
exportable.

Introduction
1.        In 1986, the Government of Kenya (GOK) began implementing a series
of stabilization and adjustment easures to stem the deterioration in
economic performance and improve the efficiency of resource use in key
productive sectors. These measures have been supported by the IMF through a
stand-by arrangment, structural adjustment facility (SAP) and enhanced
structural adjustment facility (ISA?), and by IDA wLth sector adjustment
credits in agriculture, industry, &nd finance. 1/ Sectoral refonm
programs, and their integration with stabilization measures through the
annual Policy Framework Paper (PFP) process represented a shift in the
Bank's strategy for supporting adjustment in Kenya. In the early 1980s,
Bank adjustment lendlng to Kenya consisted of two structural adjustment
loans (SAL). These loans (approved in 1980 and 1982) were multi-sectoral
operations that involved reforms in a variety of areas including public
expenditures, agriculture, industry and trade. The Program Performance
Audit Reports (PPARs) for these loans found their implementation to be
disappointing, as a result mainly of complex conditionality that covered too
many areas; few substantive actions that were upfront; and inadequate
consensus and administrative capabilities within GCO on key issues. 21
The sector adjustment strategy, therefore, has relied on the implementation
of coordinated, clearly focussed and administratively feasible operations.
2.        The Industrial Sector Adjustment Credit (ISAC) was approved in
1988 to support the first phase of GOK's policy reforms in industry and
trade. These reforms sought to respond to the substantLal challenges to
Kenya's industrial sector that became apparent during the mid-1980s. After
expanding rapidly until 1980, industrial growth had slowed, reflecting the
structural problems that resulted from an import substitution strategy and
declining exports following the collapse of the East African Community. The
sector had become increasingly inward-looking, efficiency had declined, and
investment had fallen continuously since 1978 as opportunities for
profitable import substitution shrank. It was clear that if sectoral growth
were to accelerate, it would need to be oriented towards more competitive
export markets rather than being sustained by the expansion of domestic
demand and the displacement of imports. Sectoral and firm-level efficiency
would need to be improved and, since capacity utilization was already high,
increased investment would be necessary.

Agricultural Sector Adjustment Operation (ASAO) approved in 1986; the
Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC) approved in 1989; and the Export
Development Project (EDP) presented to the Board in December 1990.

Obiectives
3.        The Credit supported the first phase of GOK's medium-term
adjustment program for the industrial and financial sectors. Given the
constraints that affected the performance of the sector, the reform program
had three main objectives: to improve sectoral efficiency; to stimulate
private investment; and to encourage export production. The reform strategy
had tvo parts. The first focussed principally on changes in import policies
so as to raise efficiency by exposing Kenyan producers to greater import
competition. The second aimed at increasing the profitability of new
investments, both in export and domestic industries, with measures that
included enhanced investment and export incentives, price decontrol, and
financial market reforms. It was intended that these reforms would be
extended and deepened under a complementary financial sector operation
(PSAC) and a follow-up ISAC II operation (now modified as EDP).
Implementation of Reforms
4.        The program covered a range of actions in industrial, trade and
financial policy, as well as several studies to support implementation.
These actions and studies are detailed in Annexes 1 and 2, which update the
corresponding annexes in the original project document with the
implementation experience in each area.
S.        Macroeconomic framework.  Since the maintenance of a balanced
macroeconomic environment was critical to the success of the reforms under
the ISAC program, implementation was carried out in the context of a
stabilization program. These stabilization measures were necessary to
correct the imbalances that had emerged in 1987 as a result of terms of
trade shocks and lax fiscal management, and were agreed jointly between GOK,
tho IMF and the Bank as part of the annual PFP process. These measures
focussed particularly on the adoption of flexible exchange rate policies and
steps to reduce aggregate demand. Significant nominal depreciations of the
Kenyan Shilling have been implemented since 1987 and, as a result, the real
exchange rate (by standard trade-weighted measures) depreciated 10 percent
in 1986-89, reversing the appreciation of about 9 percent that occurred in
1980-85. Progress has also been made in managing aggregate demand since
1987 by reducing the budget deficit, from a peak of 6.6 percent of GDP
(excluding grants) in PY1987 to about 4.2 percent in FY1990. However, these
measures have not translated into improvements in the current account
deficit, which rose from 6.2 percent of GDP in 1987 (excluding grants) to
6.9 percent in 1989, largely as a result of adverse terms of trade shocks,
stagnant exports, and significant import expenditures by parastatal
corporations (e.g., aircraft leases by Kenya Airways).
6.        Trade policy.  The policy changes in this area focussed primarily
on increasing the transparency of import protection and on enhancing the
effectiveness of export promotion, rather than reducing significantly the
anti-export bias implied by these policies.
(i) Import policies. These measures aimed at increasing
transparency by shifting from QRs (based on import licensing) to tariffs as
the main instrument in providing protection. Until June 1988, imports were
classified into four schedules, with import licensing being highly



- 61 -
discretionary, time-consuming and uncertain. Imports on two of the four
schedules were controlled tightly, in effect being subject to QRs. While
the system of import licensing itself was retained because the Kenyan
economy was likely to continue to be faced with short-term foreign exchange
constraints, the reforms aimed at making the licensing process less
discretionary, and reducing the coverage of QRs. Specifically, the ISAC
reforms have: (i) reclassifiad imports into five schedules, of which four
(Schedules 1, 2, 3A, and 3B) are now subject to automatic licensing; 3/
and (ii) streamlined the import licensing system to improve the speed of
processing and reduce uncertainty. As a result, the import coverage of QRs
has been reduced since 1988 (Table 1); the average lag from license
application to allocation of foreign exchange for imports has fallen from
over six months in 1988 to about four weeks; and importers are provided with
explicit reasons if license applications are rejected.

7.          Along with the shift from QRs to tariffs as the main instrument
of protection, there has also been progress towards simplifying the tariff
structure. This process was initiated in 1988 and continued in 1989, with
the replacement of most specific tariffs with ad valorem rates, a reduction
in the number of tariff categories from 25 to 12, and revisions so that
similar rates apply to comparable products. As intended, some tariff rates
were raised when automatic licensing was instituted (in 1989 and 1990) for
items that compete with domestic production (items on Schedule 3B), although
in most cases the higher rates provide less protection than had existed with
QRs. During program implementation, it was also agreed with GOK that the
composition of Schedule 3B would be revised, by removing some items that
competed with vulnerable domestic industries, before extending automatic
3/ The composition of these schedules is as follows: Schedule 1--high-
priority raw materials, intermediate and capital goods; Schedule 2--bulk
items that require ministerial approval regarding specific technical
criteria (e.g. fertilizer); Schedule 3A--items similar to those in Schedule
1, but less standardized; Schedule 3B--imports that compete with domestic
production and are restricted only with tariffs; and Schedule 3C--other
competing imports and luxury goods, restricted with QRs, including items
restricted for public health and safety reasons.



- 62 -
licensing to this Schedule in June 1989. It is now envisaged that the
extension of automatic licensing to these imports would be completed in June
1991, a year later than in the original timetable. The net effect of these
tariff changes since 1986/87 is also shown in Table 1.
8.          (ii) Export incentives.  The reforms under ISAC aimed at dealing
with the prevailing anti-export bias by improving access to existing
incentive schemes rather than by instituting more aggressive export
promotion measures. The existing schemes, which attempted to provide
exporters with duty-free inputs and direct assistance, were being
implemented poorly and provided little incentive to most exporters. On the
provision of direct assistance to exporters, a study was undertaken under
ISAC to help GOK design a medium-term program.
9.          Changes were made in the schemes that provided duty-free inputs
to exporters--export compensation (EC) and manufacturing-under-bond (HUB).
The EC scheme, which has been in operation since 1974, and provides
exporters of eligible products (about 700 items in 1988) with a refund of 20
percent of the FOB export value to compensate for duties on imported inputs.
Since it had been plagued by delays in making compensation payments, and
benefited only a few large exporters, a study was undertaken under ISAC to
identify the changes required to improve its operation. 4/ It was
recommended that steps be taken to broaden its coverage and ensure faster
reimbursement of exporters. As a result, the coverage has been expanded (to
about 1200 items in 1989), and the time required for reimbursement has
fallen (about 75 percent of applications are now approved in an average of
36 days). The HUB facility is available only to firms specialized in
exports, and exempts these firms from duties on all imported inputs subject
to the posting of Customs bonds. While the regulations governing this
scheme were clarified in June 1988, its attraction has remained limited
because of its high operating costs (license fees, bonding costs, and
Customs costs), and the prohibition on domestic sales of rejects. Only five
firms have availed of this facility, although several others have been
licensed but are yet to begin operations.
10.         Production, Trading and Investment Regulations.  ISAC reforms
focussed on the three key regulatory and fiscal factors that had discouraged
manufacturing investment by raising start-up and operating costs for
businesses: (i) time-consuming, discretionary and non-transparent approval,
licensing, and other regulatory procedures; (ii) high effective corporate
tax rates; and (iii) price controls on a variety of manufactured products.
Actions required, therefore, sought to streamline investment approval and
licensing procedures; reduce effective tax rates; and decontrol prices for
about 20 product groups. To facilitate the investment and regulatory
approvals process, GOK established a one-stop office in 1988 in the
Investment Promotion Center (IPC) to assist investors with approvals. This
unit was supplemented in 1989 by the establishment of a Cabinet Sub-
Committee chaired by the Vice President, to provide high-level coordination
for eliminating administrative bottlenecks for investment approvals, and
streamlining licensing procedures.
4/ Since FY1981, the top four exporters have received between 37 and 66
percent of each year's total payments under the scheme.



- 63 -
11.         The effective tax rate has also fallen since 1988, with the
corporate profit tax having been reduced from 45 to 40 percent, and the
implementatLon of measures to enhance investment allowances and allow the
tax-deductibility of exchange lop es on foreign currency loane. Finally, an
amendment to the Foreign Investment Protection Act (PIPA) eased the
remittance of capital gains on equity investments, and allowed these
investments to be denominated in foreign currency terms. On price
decontrol, implementation was accelerated with the removal of controls on
the prices of 20 product categories, including farm equipment, soaps and
detergents, paints, and electrlc cables, in May 1988 (before Boar4
Presentation). Prices of several additional items including fertilizers,
animal feeds and soft drinks, have since been decontrolled. Currently,
items within 18 product categories remain subject to the General Price
Control Order while 11 others (mostly cor:sumer staples) are subject to
Specific Price Control Orders. To limit the need to use price controls in
combatting market power, the Restrictive Trade Practices, Honopolies and
Price Control Act was also enacted in 1989. However, the provisions of this
Act are not yet being applied systematically to promote competition.
12.         Financial Sector.  While implementation of financial sector
reform was undertaken comprehensively in 1989 under the program supported
with the subsequent FSAC, it was initiated under ISAC in two areas. First,
GOK designed, and began implementing, an action program to restructure two
major development finance institutions (DFIs). This plan was based on a
study under ISAC of the roles and portfolios of three major industrial
DFIs. 5/ These institutions are the largest of the specialized DFIs,
which had been established by the Government in the 19609 and 1970s to
alleviate perceived market failures in the provision of long-term credit and
equity. The operations of the DFIs had two undesirable effects. First,
they worsened the segmentation of the sector by making it even less
attractive to commercial banks to undertake term lending. Second, their
poor financial and operational performance (which was partly due to the
Government's use of these institutions to promote non-economic policy
objectives) implied that they constituted a significant financial drain on
scarce budgetary resources.   The restructuring plan, which is aimed at
establishing ICDC and IDB as viable and commercially-oriented institutions,
covers changes in their mandates, autonomy, funding, organization, and
lending/investment processes, as well as the phased divestiture and
consolidation of assets.
13.         Policies to stimulate the development of Kenya's capital markets
were also introduced under ISAC. An important policy-induced barrier to the
development of the equity market had been the controls exercised by the
Cap.tal Issues Committee (CIC) over the timing and pricing of all equity
issues. With the enactment of the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) Act in
1989, the powers of the CIC over domestic share issues have been eliminated,
5/ The three DFIs included in the study were Industrial and Commercial
Development Corporation (ICDC), Industrial Development Bank (IDB), and
Development Finance Company of Kenya (DFCK). Since DFCK is majority-owned
by foreign donors, the restructuring plan covers )vily ICDC and IDB, with
discussions underway to extend the approach to DFCK



- 64 -
and the regulatory, institutional, and promotional framework for the
securities industry has been strengthened.
14.         Studies.  As shown in Annex 2, the Credit financed several
studies (including financing under a Project Preparation Facility) to
provide the analytical basis for Board Presentation and Second Tranche
actions in key policy ar6as. The most important of these dealt with the
design of the second phase of import liberalization (calculation of
equivalent tariffs for imports on Schedules 3B and 3C); changes in tax
policy so as to reduce the marginal effective tax rate for manufacturing
investments; and an analysis of the structure and portfolios of the three
major industrial DFIs. Although there was some slippage in timing (Annex
2), all the studies, except the one that dealt with the effects of price
decontrol, were completed. The price decontrol study was not undertaken
because it was considered redundant in light of GOK's continued actions in
this area.
Achievements of the Reform Program
15.         Since the implementation of these measures has been recent and
represents only the first phase of the reform program, firm-level
adjustments to these changes are not yet complete. It is, therefore, too
early to measure the impact on the ultimate reform objectives--sectoral
efficiency, investment and exports. 61 However, the impact of the
reforms on sectoral and firm-level incentives is clearer, and four main
effects can be distinguished:
(a)   Import policies are now less restrictive than in 1988.  The
coverage of QRs has been reduced (Table 1) and, for imports that
conmpete with domestic production, these have been replaced in
most cases with less than equivalent tariffs. The import
licensing system itself has been streamlined and made more
transparent, as a result of which delays in processing and
uncertainty regarding license approvals have bqen reduced
sharply. Finally, the number of tariff categories, the coverage
of specific tariffs, and average tariff rates have all fallen
(Table 1). These changes have laid the ground for more
aggressive measures to reduce the variability of effective
protection.
(b)   Price decontrol has proceeded at a rapid but sustainable pace.
The strategy of gradual price decontrol (para. 11) that has been
followed since June 1988 has resulted in efficiency gains while
limiting the adverse effects of higher prices on consumers. As
a result, decontrol has met with little resistance, and it is
anticipated that the lumber of controlled products would
continue to fall.
61 A more comprehensive evaluation of these effects is underway as part of
a study being undertaken in the Country Economics Department, and financed
under the Trade Expansion Program of the UNDP.



- 65 -
(c)   Prospects for the growth of equity markets have been improved as
a result of the enactment of the CMA Bill and the promotional
and regulatory authority it grants the CMA. The development of
equity markets would expand the market for long-term investment
funds. Further, it would assist in the divestiture of assets by
the DFIs as part of their restructuring strategies developed
under this program.
(d)   The investment approval system has been streamlined with the
establishment of the one-stop office in the IPC, and the
operation of the Cabinet Sub-Committee (para. 10). Their
interventions have reduced the uncertainties and delays in the
approval process, and have been supplemented with steps to
eliminate redundant regulations, and to simplify licensing
procedures.
16.         The effects on manufactured exports and investment constitute
the most significant linkage between macroeconomic performance and the
reforms supported under ISAC. However, since the reforms have been recent,
only tentative conclusions can be drawn about these linkages. Manufactured
exports (defined broadly to cover processed materials including food, fuel
and other raw materials), grew in nominal doiiar terms in both 1988 and
1989, reversing their decline between 1984 and 1987 (Table 2). Although
much of this growth has been in processed raw materials, manufactured
exports are less concentrated now than in 1984. However, the dependence on
a few processed raw materials remains high, and the absolute levels of other
manufactured exports is still small. Manufacturing sector investment
recovered between 1985 and 1988, thereby reversing its decline since 1978.
But this recovery preceded most of the ISAC reforms, and reflected higher
agricultural production and better macroeconomic management rather than the
sectoral policy changes. Moreover, investment declined slightly in 1989.

Credit Administration. Use and Coordination
17.         Procurement and Disbursement.  Procurement procedures were
designed to ensure rapid disbursement of the Credlt proceeds while
preserving efficiency and accountability. The Credit flnanced the foreign
exchange costs of general imports not specified on a negative list of item.
much as imports financed from other sources, mllitary equipment, and luxury
goods. All contracts over $ 3.5 mLilion were to follow International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) while public and private sector imports below that
amount were to be handled according to regular commercial practices using at
least three quotations. Procurement with ICB was not required for any
contract since all claims submitted to IDA were below $ 3.5 million. Since
the threshold for the use of statement of expenditures (S0E) in
disbursements was set at the same level as for ICB procurement, SOEs were
used to disburse the entire Credit amount. do Special Account was used with
all disbursements handled on a reimbursement basis. Disbursements were
based on preshlpment inspection services for imports provided by three
international firms, and these procedures had been reviewed by IDA and
judged acceptable.
18.         Disbursements under ISAC were completed in December 1989.  The
Credit proceeds were used entirely to finance private sector imports, with
about 70 percent of the funds estimated to have financed raw material
imports. Local currency funds generated by the sale of foreign exchange
provided under the Credit were available to GOK without restriction and were
used to supplement its budget.
19.         Audits and Accounts.  The audit report and accounts for the
Credit were due within six months of the end of each fiscal year. For
FY1989 (ending June 1989), these were delayed until October 1990, and even
when submitted, the reports were incomplete. These problems reflected lack
of coordination between the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), which channelled
the credit proceeds and was supposed to retain copies of all disbursement
claims submitted to IDA, and the $inistry of Finance, which approved
reimbursement of claims. As an IDA supervision mission found in 1989, this
confusion meant that back-up documentation for the proceeds of the first
tranche of the Credit had not been maintained systematically. Subsequently,
IDA staff from headquarters and the Nairobi Disbursement Unit assisted CBK
and Ministry of Finance officials in improving their documentation
procedures.
20.         Conditionality and Tranchina.  The Credit was disbursed in two
tranches--the first was available in August 1988 upon effectiveness, and the
second in October 1989, when conditions for tranche release were judged by
IDA to have been met satisfactorily. There were eleven conditions for Board
Presentation of the Credit, and six conditions for Second Tranche release,
and these conditions covered seven distinct areas (Annex 1). The initial
implementation of one Board Presentation condition--unrestricted licensing
of imports in Schedules 1, 2, and 3A--was slow because of uncertainty about
a suitable monitoring mechanism. This issue was resolved following
installation of such a system in February 1989. Several Second Tranche
release conditions were problematic because they were based on the (yet
unknown) results of studies that were financed under the Credit. In
particular, the extension of unrestricted licensing to Schedule 3B, and the



- 67 -
design and implementation of an action program to restructure DPIs required
extensive discussions between GOK officials and IDA staff before they could
be resolved.
21.         Coordination with the IMF.  The measures supported under ISAC
were part of the overall stabilization and structural adjustment package
supported by the IMF. As noted in para. 5, the PPP process has been the
vehicle by which structural reforms such as those undertaken under ISAC have
been coordinated with the stabilization program being implemented with IMF
support. The IMF's support has been provided through a Stand-by arrangement
and a SAF, both approved in 1988, as well as an ESAF which replaced the SAP
in 1989, and of which the second annual arrangement was approved by the IMF
Board in April 1990.
The Role of the World Bank
22.         The Bank has played an important role in the design and
implementation of the industrial and trade sector reforms undertaken by GOK
under ISAC. Preparation of the ISAC adjustment program began with the
completion of a sector report in 1987 as part of the Bank's economic and
sector work (ESW) program. 7/ Detailed design of the components of the
program emerged from discussions of this report with an inter-ministerial
committee that included representatives from key economic ministries and the
Central Bank.
23.         The close policy dialogue between the Bank and GOK on these
issues also assisted in implementation of the reform package. Bank staff
from headquarters as well as the Resident Mission supervised the Credit
intensively. 8/ This supervision effort included oversight of the
studies financed under the Credit, and was particularly useful in
implementing reforms in three areas--the second phase of import
liberalization, the restructuring of DFIs, and the enactment of the CMA Act.
In all three areas, timely supervision inputs from the Bank assisted GOK in
formulating and implementing detailed programs that enabled the release of
the Second Tranche of the Credit on schedule in November 1989.
24.         During implementation of ISAC, discussions were also initiated
with GOK on follow-up Bank assistance in four areas. First, it was agreed
that more aggressive actions to promote non-traditional exports were
required to complement the measures initiated under ISAC, and should combine
policy reforms, investment, and technical assistance. This package, which
is to be supported by IDA with a hybrid operation--the proposed Export
Development Project--constitutes the second phase of sectoral reforms, and
aims to reduce anti-export bias, and provide institutional and
infrastructural support to non-traditional exports. Second, implementation

planned allocation.

of the restructuring program for the two DFIs (para. 12) is being supported
by IDA under the Financial Parastatals Technical Assistance Project approved
in May 1990. This project provides GOK and the DFIs with the necessary
technical resources to implement actions to establish self-sustaining and
commercially viable institutions. Third, when it was agreed to revise the
composition of import Schedule 3B (para. 7) before extending automatic
licensing to these imports in June 1989, GOK sought IDA nssistance in
formulating and implementing a restructuring program for the textile sector.
A sector study has since been completed, and would be used in providing IDA
support for a restructuring program for textile parastatals as part of a
proposed Parastatal Reform Project. Fourth, GOK has sought, and the Bank
will provide, analytical support to identify the changes in the business
environment, including regulations, commercial law, and business services,
that are necessary to support the next phase of sectoral adjustment. It is
expected that this study would be conducted during 1991.
Evaluation of Reforms and the Remaining Agenda
25.         As para. 15 indicates, implementation of the ISAC reforms has
beent effective in maintaining the nace and momentum of industrial, financial
and trade sector adjustment. 9/ In order to sustain the reform effort,
changes were made in the sLope and timing of some conditionality under the
Credit (para. 7). Despite these changes, GOK's commitment to the adjustment
effort remains strong, as demonstrated by its implementation of further
reforms in 1990. However, since the actions under ISAC focussed mainly on
enhancing transparency rather than on offsetting anti-export bias, increases
in manufacturing investment and exports have not yet resulted. For this
reason, and for the referm program to gain credibility, these measures have
to be sustained over a longer period.
26.         In addition to maintaining these measures, there are four policy
areas in which further actions would be required. First, on import
policies, continued progress towards greater transparency in providing
protection must be accompanied by tariff reductions to lower the level and
range of effective protection. In 1990-91, GOK intends (with IDA support
under the proposed EDP) to replace all remaining QRs on imports (with
exceptions only for health, safety and environmental reasons) with
equivalent or lower tariffs; lower the range and levels of nominal tariffs;
and limit specific >-riff exemptions granted to non-exporters. While these
changes would constit.ute progress towards GOK's longer-term objectives on
trade policy, effective protection would remain high and variable. It is
expected, therefore, that further reform would focus on two areas: (i)
extending the process of tariff reduction, particularly to finished and
intermediate good imports that compete with domestic production; and (ii)
increasing the transparency of the system of protection by reducing the
coverage of import licensing, and eventually eliminating it.
9| A recent multi-donors Special Program of Assistance (SPA) mission to
Kenya reached the same conclusions regarding GOK's implementation of
adjustment programs, and was particularly impressed by the import
liberalization actions that had been initiated under ISAC.

27.         Second, GOK has begun implementing export promotion measures
that would offset significantly the anti-export bias implied by high import
protection. These include the recent introduction (as part of the policy
reforms supported under EDP) of a duty/VAT exemption scheme as an
alternative to the EC scheme for partial exporters, and provision of
incentives to exporters located within designated Export Processing Zones
(EPZs), the first of which has just begun operating outside Nairobi. There
are two longer-term needs in this areas (i) to review, and rationalize as
necessary, the multiple schemes currently in existence to provide exporters
with duty-free access to inputs: and (ii) to extend access to duty-free
imports to indirect exporters.
28.         Third, reforms in industrial regulations have been initiated
under the EDP, which focus mainly on eliminating redundant approvals,
licenses and permits and ensuring transparency in the design and
administration of regulations. The next steps would involve further moves
towards consolidating and streamlining regulations as well as revising
regulations that reduce economic efficiency by affecting the autonomy of
firms in areas such as price-setting, entry/expansion/exit, distribution,
and procurement.
29.         Fourth, GOK has undertaken reforms (under the program supported
by IDA with FSAC), in financial sector policies that have built on those
introduced under ISAC. While these have focussed on enhancing the returns
to equity investments, concerns still remain about the limited availability
of long-term finance--both debt and equity. The policy and structural
constraints to the expansion of term finance, including restrictions on
equity investment by insurance companies and uncertainties in the legal
framework for financial transactions, need to be addressed.
Sustainability of the Overall Adjustment Effort
30.         As noted in paras. 1-2, ISAC was designed after Kenya's
adjustment effort shifted in 1986 towards the use of sector-based programs.
Sustainability was an important consideration in developing these programs
and, on balance, these programs have been more effectively implemented than
the SALs of the early-1980s because they have taken account of the limited
implementation capacity within GOK; their design has elicited grePter
accountability and ownership by the implementing agencies; and they have
emphasized incremental changes. Moreover, as with ISAC, they have been
intensively supervised, which has allowed adjustments in implementation to
be made according to changes in exogenous economic factors. Sustainability
has also been an important consideration in coordinating these programs with
stabilization policies designed to assure macroeconomic balance.
31.         Despite the achievements of the ISAC reforms (paras. 15-16), the
sectoral adjustment effort is not yet complete and the reforms still face
the risk of being reversed, particularly if a rapid response in exporcs and
private investment are not forthcoming. For instance, the need to conserve
foreign exchange might be used to restore QRs on imports unless non-



- 70 -
traditional export growth can be accelerated. 10/ The risk of such
policy reversal would also be reduced if a successful export development
effort were to include small and medium enterprises so as to mobilize a
broad-based constituency that favors policies that support non-traditional
exports rather than import-substitution. These considerations are reflected
in the design of GOK's current export strategy, which would be supported by
IDA with the proposed EDP.
Lessons of Experience
32.         While it is too early to judge whether the adjustment efforts
supported under ISAC have been successful, its implementation provides four
main lessons. First, reforms must be designed to fit the administrative
capacities of implementing agencies and ministries. This requirement is
particularly important with regard to the number and coverage of tranche
release conditions. In the case of ISAC, the tranche release conditions
were numerous and covered too many areas (para. 20). As a result, the
capacity of the implementing agencies to administer the reforms was
overstretched, contributing to delays in initiating actions, particularly
with regard to import licensing. Second, reforms must be sustainable in
terms of their consistency and phasing. One aspect of this linkage is the
importance of nesting sectoral reform within a consistent macroeconomic
framework. As noted in para. 5, the ISAC reforms were implemented and
carefully coordinated through the PFP process with an IMP-supported
stabilization program. This coordination was critical in ensuring that
exchange rate management and fiscal policy were consistent with the trade
policy changes under ISAC. The importance of phasing components of a trade
liberalization program is illustrated also by the criticism of the ISAC
package on the grounds that it emphasized import liberalization at the
expense of export promotion (see footnote 10). This perception, while not
wholly justified, has arisen because the export promotion components of the
program were implemented more slowly than was anticipated. Third, the
reforms demonstrate the need for detailed preparation in designing not only
the specific components but also the benchmarks to be used in judging
implementation. While the sector work that preceded ISAC was useful in
defining the broad areas of policy reform, the program lacked the detail
necessary to assess progress in key areas such as the liberalization of the
import licensing process (para. 20). Consequently, these guidelines had to
be developed during program implementation, delaying some actions. Fourth,
the experience with ISAC underscores the need for intensive supervision and
monitoring with such programs. It is clear that the intensity of
supervision played an important role in the successful implementation of the
program, particularly with regard to the import liberalization component and
formulation of the action plan for restructuring DFIs (para. 23).
10/ There remains the widespread perception within and outside Kenya that
the rapid import growth in 1988 and 1989 has occuirred principally because of
the import liberalization measures taken under ISAC. Detailed analysis of
import data until December 1989 indicates that more liberal licensing of
imports in Schedule 3C (which officially remain subject to QRs), and an
accommodative macroeconomic stance have been important contributory factors
as well. See, Kenya: Stabilization and Adiustment--Report No. 9047-KE,
World Bank, 1990 (pp.49-51), for details.

Part II is the Government of Kenya's comments on Parts I and III of
the Program Completion Report.
PAlT Ilt PROGRAM RIrEW nOK TIM BOROWI'RS PERSPECTIVE
National Expectations
1.          Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 indicated an awareness of the
need for reform in the industrial sector and specifically laid emphasis
upon t:ie need for reforms that benefitted the small scale
industrialists. There was a less well defined awareness of the balance
of payments aspects of industrial reform, although the degree of
effective rate of protection was known to be high and indicating an
anti-export bias.
Project Preparatlon
2.          In the course of project preparation the shift towards a
concentration on large scale industries and market liberalization,
diverted very nearly the entire Government implementation capacity hence
small scale industries received negligible analysis while exports,
although addressed, did not receive the emphasis that they warranted
hence Government efforts were occupied with areas which, though
desirable, did not relate to sustainability arising from employment
creation or through the balance of payments. The background of the
negotiations was further obfuscated by the fact that the Government had
only just negotiated the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Operation, and
Jn consequence was not '!lly familiar with the importance of balancing
the phasing of a programme. The Government had the expectation, which
was not born out by reality, that quick disbursing funds would be
available to ensure that the liberalization process could be sustained
without straining the country's resources. It was realized, but not
explicitly dealt with by the Government and project designers, that
speculation was inevitable and reserves would therefore be in jeopardy.
Pro1ect Implementation
3.          It was agre0  that Parts I and III are an adequate
reflection of the project implementation. The number and complexity of
monitorable conditions that can be supervised by senior Government
personnel needs to be better understood particularly by Bank supervisory
staff.



72 -
Outcome
4.          The most positive aspects are the generation of the Export
Development Programme and the efforts to establish a basis for the
parastatal sector. The investment environment has undoubtedly improved
due to ISAC and FSAC, but it will take time to have any noticeable
effect, particularly since major developments in the economy need to
come from new entrepreneurs in the small and intermediate scales of
industry. Certainly ISAC reforms are not sustainable without a
significant expansion of exports. Purthermore all the structural
reforms of Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 in the fiscal and finance
areas are making a significant complementary input to the desired
outcomes.
5.          The Policy Framework Papers and the IMF programmes have
provided an important support to such strategies. ut it is vital that
programmes continue to be "owned' by the Government. There comes a time
where excessive conditionalities greatly undermine project ownership
and then the commitment to sustaining reforms after funds are disbursed
is much diluted. It is therefore better that reforms are few and well
phased to have a significant impact on target sectors.
