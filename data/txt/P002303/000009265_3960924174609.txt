THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDITS 908-SE AND gtC 11-SE)
PREPACE
1.    The Third Education Project in Senegal was financed by a Credit extended
by the International Development Association (IDA) under Credit Agreement Cr-
908-SE signed by IDA on 23 May 1979. The Credit became effective on 23 August
1979. The closure of the Credit Account is foreseen for 31 May 1987.
2.    At the invitation of the Goveriment of Senegal and under the terms of the
co-operative agreement between Unesco and the World Bank, a Unesco project
completion mission visited Senegal from 8 to 21 March 1987. The mission was
composed of Messrs Ben Mady Cisse (general educator), chief of mission and
member of the Educational Financing Division, R. Ganeff (general educator) and D.
Dupety (architect), consultants. Before the mission, Messrs Ganeff and Dupety
visited the Headquarters of IDA in Washington DC from 22 to 27 February 1987 for
a review of the files and for discussions with the appropriate authorities of the
Western Africa Projects Department Education Division. A visit was paid to the
French Development Fund (CCCE) in Dakar.
3.    The principal task of the mission was to assess whether the objectives of
the project had been attained, to compare the estimated and actual costs, and to
evaluate the present impact of the project on the education system (in particular,
primary education in rural areas and technical education), to examine the viability
of each component, and to draw lessons for the Government and IDA from the
experience of preparation and Implementation of this project.
4.    The report has been prepared on the basis of information gathered through
visits to project institutions and meetings with the appropriate authorities in
Senegal, together with information previously obtained from IDA headquarters.
5.    The mission gratefully acknowledges the valuable assistance provided by
the Government of Senegal, in particular the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), in
the preparation of this report.
6.    A draft of the report was sent to the Government of Senegal and IDA for
comment. Comments were received from the Government and IDA and these have
been incorporared.
7.    The opinions and conclusions contained in this report represent the
judgements of the mission following the consultations indicated above. They do not
necessarily reflect the points of view of the Government, IDA, or Unesco.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SENEGAL
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDITS 908-SE AND SAC 11-SE)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1. Origin and content of the IxoLect
i.    Between 1977 and 1978 the Government of Senegal, with the help of
Unesco, prepared a Credit Application for a Third Education Project. The
proposed project was appraised in June 1978. The Credit was approved and the
Agreement was signed in May 1979 and became effective in August 1979. The
total cost of the project was estimated at US$33.1 million, with financin
provided by IDA (US$22 million) the European Economic Community (EEC)
Special Action Fund (US$4.5 million) the French Development Fund (CCCE)
(US$4.5 million) and Senegal (US$2.1 million).
H.    The project made the following provisions for the several sub-sectors:
(a)    Primary education and educational plannint and research: (i) experts and
equipment for the study, experimentation and ormu ation of curricula
for teaching in three national languages in primary schools; (ii) experts,
furniture and equipment to establish the National Institute of Research
and Action for the Development of Education (INEADE); (iii) experts and
fellowships for a pre-investment study; and (iv) construction, furniture
and equipment for the Kolda Regional Teacher Training Institute (ENR),
fellowships and experts for the pre-service training and refresher
training of teachers.
(b)    Technical education: (i) construction, equipment and experts for a 180-
place technical teacher training college and enlargement of the
University Institute of Technology (IUT) to provide 160 places; and (ii)
equipment and buildings for two technical secondary schools.
(c)    Vocational training:  construction, furniture and equipment for the
Vocational Training and Upgrading Centre (CFPP) and Dakar Vocational
Training Centre (CQID), fellowships and experts for improving curricula
and financing studies with a view  to the creation of a National
Organization for Vocational Training (ONFP).
(d)    Agtricultural education: construction, furniture, equipment, fellowships
and experts for the National Rural Development Institute (INDR).
(e)    Management training: construction, furniture, equipment, experts and
fellowships required for establishing the Higher School of Business
Management (ESGE).
(f)    Administration: services of experts, equipment and operating costs to
strengthen the existing PIU.



- ix -
iii.   In the course of implementation, the content of the project was
modified: (a) in 1981, the Kolda ENR boarding facilities were discontinued and
replaced by 24 classrooms; (b) in 1982, provision of 66 primary classrooms was
added to the project and brought later on to 86 classrooms; (c) in 1984, a
laboratory farm was added to INDR and the renovation of the Peytavin and
Delafosse secondary schools was added; and (d) in 1985, some additional work on
the CNQP was included.
2. Prolect lmDlementatlon
iv.    The implementation of the project was spread over eight years instead of
the four and a half years forecast at appraisal. This lag was due to: (a) the
dispersal of responsibility for the technical management of the project (four
ministries initially); (b) the weak start of the primary education component in
which not much was done until 1983; (c) shortages of Government financing; (d)
delays in the construction of primary classrooms and the renovation of technical
secondary schools; and (e) the addition of project items.
v.    The project was administered by the existing PIU, placed initially under
the supervision of the Ministry of Public Works and then transferred in 1986 to
the Ministry of National Education (MEN). There was continuity of staff of the
PIU until 1985; during that year various changes interrupted and affected the
management, accounting system and inspection of the sites. These services are
currently being reinforced.
vi.    Agreed changes in the physical aspects of the project increased
construction areas by 34 per cent. The civil works were assigned to private
contractors and consultants selected on the basis of competitive bidding. The
selection of sites was generally well done; only the remote location of the Kolda
ENR inconveniences the teacher trainees and the 800 pupils of the laboratory
school, who have to spend a great deal of time travelling.
vii.   The equipment, procured through international competitive bidding in
two phases, is suitable. However, in some cases, problems have been noted in
operating costs. For example, the electronic equipment of the Nalion l
University School of Technology (ENSUT), the former IUT, is poorly protected
from dust as well as for the central air conditioning and the audkovisual aids of
the ENSETP. Operating budgets are inadequate and consequently toois, spare
parts and working materials are not replaced as they should be.
viii.   On the whole, the buildings constructed under the project are of good
quality. Hodwever, with inadequate training of the masons responsible for the
primary classrooms, some arches collapsed at the beginning of the work.
Subsequently, more regular supervision was exercised with the assistance of the
public works and town planning departments in the Kolda and Tambacounda
regions. The partly glazed pyramidal roof of the Higher Education Centre for
Training in Management (CESAG) hall is not appropriate in view of the climate.
ix.    It was considered unlikely that work on the primary classrooms of
Tambacounda, the Delafosse and Peytavin secondary schools, and the INDR farm
and enclosure would be completed by 31 May 1987, the date when the Credit
Accounts for 908-SE and 01 1-SE were expected to be closed.

Supervision
x.    During the eight years of project implementation there were 1S
supervisorY missions. The average time they devoted to the Project was 15.3
days. Twelve missions included an architect, eleven an economist, seven a
gencral educator, three an agricultural educator, two a technical educator and
one a management educator.
xi.    Mission composition had certain repercussions upon the technical
education component which needed closer monitoring, and the agricultural
education component, which lacked experts on mission for three years.
Technical assistance (TA)
xii.   TA was implemented satisfactorily in quantitative terms, but less
satisfactorily qualitatively. TA was little or poorly utilized in the case of the
fellowships for primary education (INEADE) and agricultural education (INDR)
and experts for ENSETP and the technical secondary schools. In the case of
INEADE and INDR this seriously compromised their operation. Refresher
training for teachers and school principals was not provided. Time overruns In
construction work had affected the implementing of TA.
xiii.   With respect to work on national languages, it was evident that local
experts and local training would have been more advantageous than recourse to
outside experts or training abroad.
Project outcomes
xiv.   The primary education/INEADE sub-components did not fully attain their
respective objectives and very little was done to introduce national languages
and pedagogical innovations in teacher training. Towards the end of project
implementation and especially in 1985/86, several studies and seminars were
organized, which should facilitate the achievement of the objectives of the Third
Project under the Primary Education Project Cr.173S-SE.
xv.   DRPY/ benefited from  institutional strengthening, and its expanded
staff, assisted by foreign experts, was able to accomplish a considerable amount
of work in the fields of educational statistics, educational planning and school
mapping. The DRP is seen as an essential instrument in implementing an overall
strategy of financing an expanded educational and training system without
markedly increasing the sector demands on the resources of the State.
xvi.   The Kolda ENR attained its objective and will soon be steadily turning
out the target number of teachers. It is intended to use the Kolda ENR as a
refresher training centre for the personnel of three regions, and as one of the
core centres for training teachers needed for the New School.
xvii.  ENSETP is at present operating satisfactorily, using for some of its
courses the premises of the neighbouring ENSUT. However, its costs per student
year are too high and this is due to under enrolment and the high proportion of
expatriates on the staff. In addition, ENSETP needs to establish closer and more
formal relations with ENSUT and to follow-up graduates systematically. The
1/    Since the restructuring of the MEN, the DRP is called the Department of
Studies, Human Resources and Planning (DERP).



- xi -
project has provided the two technical secondary schools with satisfactory
operating conditions. They also need to review curriculum content, improve
internal efficiency and actively continue the Senegalization of the teaching
staff.
xviii. The objectives of the CNQP component in vocational training were
attained, thus reinforcing the achievements of by the Second Education Project.
Pre-employment traininR and training counselling have been developed and
uptrading has been strengthened. Studies carried out under the project led to
the establishment of the ONFP to play a normative, co-ordinating and
stimulating role in the field of vocational training.
xix.   INDR has not yet attained its objectives, operating with uneconomic
enrolment and teacher:student ratio, producing few graduates and carrying too
low a proportion of Senegalese on its teaching staff. However, the institute has
made some progress over the past year in these respects and the proposed
establishment of a specialized agricultural education administrative unit within
MEN to monitor this institute might be helpful.
xx.   The  achievements  under  the  management  training  component
(ESGE/CESAG) have so far been quite impressive in terms of the amount of
training and its relevance to needs, its close relationships with the business
world, and the institutional strengthening achieved. With the aid of a new IDA
Credit (Cr.1638-SE), ESGE has been transformed into CESAG, a sub-regional
institution with capacities expanded through additional buildings, equipment and
TA. A guarantee of future development is the fact that each West African
Economic Community (CEAO) country is represented on its Executive Board of
CESAG by two members, one of whom must be of the employers' organization.
c:ost ftC
xxi.   Although the total cost of the amended project is 32 per cent higher than
the appraisal cost in terms of CFA Francs, it is 16 per cent below in terms of
US dollars. The savings made by deleting the boarding facilities of the Kolda
ENR made it possible to build laboratory classes and 86 additional classrooms.
xxii.  The experience of this project reaffirms the importance of several points
already made in regard to other projects, including:
(a)    the importance of sending appropriate specialists on supervision missions
to deal with problem areas;
(b)    the need to pay closer attention to the sustainability of project
investments, in this case the operating cost of project institutions, which
is generally too high because of levels of enrolment, student:staff ratios
and the proportion of expatriates on staff that are all uneconomic; and
(c)    the maintenance of project accounts in such a way as to facilitate
comparisons with appraisal objectives.

THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDITS 908-SE AND SAC 11-SE)
1. vW)3ECT GENEUATTOW
Country setting
1.01   Senegal in 1977 was estimated to have a population of 5.2 million of which
30 per cent lived in towns. Its GNP per capita was US$420 and over 80 per cent of
the population depended upon agriculture for a livelihood. The economic growth
which averaged 2.3 per cent per year between 1959 and 1974 lagged behind
population growth of 2.7 per cent per year. The Government was becoming
increasingly dependent on foreign aid to finance its development programme. The
development strategy of the Government was oriented toward development of
industry and irrigation.
Sector setting
1.02   Responsibility for education and training was distributed among three
ministries: (a) National Education for general and technical/vocational education
up to Grade 12; (b) Higher Education; and (c) Human Resources Development for
non formal education and training, farmer training and rural youth training. In
addition, training institutions for specif ic purposes were being operated by six
other ministries.
1.03   The slow (four per cent per year) growth in primary enrolments indicated
that universal primary enrolment would not be achieved before the year 2000. The
school enrolment ratio was only 32 per cent at primary level, 10 per cent at lower
secondary level. Internal efficiency was low in primary schools because of high
drop out rates and in secondary schools because of low examination success rates.
1.04   The Government development policy in education and training involved
mainly in:
(1)   expanding primary education in rural areas;
(2)    meeting some of the demand for secondary school places;
(3)    making the system more responsive to the specialized requirements of the
modern sector; and
(4)    strengthening educational research and planning capacity as a basis for
reform and innovation.
In particular, the Government wished to introduce teaching at primary school level
in the national languages and to reorganize in-service and pre-service training of
teachers, expand technical education programmes at the secondary level and
strengthen vocational training and management training for the modern sector and
establish university level training in agriculture.
1.05   The IDA strategy in the previous two projects (Credits 253-SE and 530-SE)
had focused on expanding educational opportunities in rural areas, diversifying
secondary education and improving vocational training.

Proiect generation
1.06   The Third Project was based on a sectoral study conducted by Unesco in
October/November 1976 and on identification and pre-appraisal missions by IDA in
1977 and 1978, following discussions between IDA and the Government on the
development and orientation of education. The working documents relating to the
project components were based on pre-investment studies conducted in 1978. The
project was appraised in June 1978 and the Credit was approved in May 1979. The
Credit Agreement was signed in May 1979 and became effective in August 1979.
The estimated total cost of the project was US$33.1 million of which US$22 million
was covered by the IDA credit, US$4.5 million by the EEC Special Action Fund,
US$4.5 million by the CCCE and the remaining US$2.1 million by the Government.
Description of the project
1.07   Proectbectives. The overall objective of this project was to create a
number o establishments and improve the quality of training and education
curricula. The specific objectives were as follows:
(a)    to establish a sound basis for expanding primary education and, to this end,
strengthen educational research and planning capacity with a view to
adopting measures to reduce education costs, in particular in the primary
sub-sector;
(b)    to improve the quality of primary school curricula through better pre-
service and in-service training of teachers and through studying the effects
of teaching in national languages in small primary classes;
(c)    to generalize and improve the programmes designed to train persons to
teach technical subjects in lower secondary schools, other secondary
schools, and vocational training schools;
(d)    to expand and improve vocational training facilities for skilled workers in
the modern sector;
(e)    to provide training in agronomy at university level;
(f)   to provide training programmes for middle and higher level executives in
private and para statal enterprises.

II. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION
2.01   The project was administered by the PIU established in the framework of
the First Education Project under the name BPETA. It was placed under the
authority of the Public Works Department of the Ministry of Equipment with the
Director of Public Works as Project Director. In January 1986, responsibility for
the PIU was transferred to DRP in the Ministry of National Educition. In addition
to his responsibilities at the DRP, the Director became Project Director.
2.02   The implementation of the educational aspects of the various components
was assigned to the appropriate departments of the various ministries concerned,
namely:
(a)    MEN - for the primary education and educational research and planning
components;
(b)    Ministry of Higher Education.L/ - for INDR, ESGE and ENSUT until 1986, in
which year this Ministry was integrated into.MEN;
(c)   the office of the Under-Secretary for Technical Education - for the
ENSETP components, the two technical secondary schools together with
CNQP, from 1983 to 1986, in which year this office was abolished and
replaced by MEN.
2.03   The function and tenure of the personnel of the PIU, are given in Annex 1.
!          There was continuity of staff until 1985, when numerous changes occurred, with an
interruption of eight to nine months between the departure of certain senior staff
- Deputy Director, Site Inspector, Chief Accountant - and the arrival of their
replacement.
2.04   Until 1984, the project was relatively well managed despite: (a) lack of co-
ordination and communication between the directors of the components; (b) delays
in presenting disbursement applications and quarterly reports; (c) lack of interest in
the management of the educational and technical assistance ispects; and (d)
unsatisfactory organization in accounting and financial management of the project.
2.05   Specific problems that are worth noting were the following:
(a)    until 1983, the poor monitoring at the central level of INEADE,
Department of Primary Education (DEE) and DRP sub-components;
(b)   the difficulties experienced in mobilising Government financing;
(c)    the under utilization of technical asistance (experts and fellowships);
(d)    the weak co-ordination of PIU activities with the work of pe sons
responsible for the educational aspects of the various components.
For INDR, provision was made for close liaison between the Ministry of
Higher Education and the Ministry of Rural Development.



-6 -
2.06   Considerable work is needed to reinforce what has been achieved and
attempted under this Third Project to ensure the optimum utilizaton of each
component separately and all the components as a whole, by improving
pupil:teacher ratios, co-ordinating actions one with another, further strengthening
the new school through the educational bases of the Koranic school, and
capitalizing on the results of IFAN and Dakar Applied Linguistics Centre (CLAD)
linguistic research on teaching in national languages.
2.07   The thoroughgoing restructuring undertaken at the level of MEN and the
Ministry of Planning and Co-operation justify hopes of profound changes, which
have already occurred in DRP and PIU.

PR03ECT IMPLEMENTATION
Project duration and modifications
3.01   Project implementation lasted eight years instead of the four and a half
years originally scheduled (Annex 2). Much of the delay is attributable to items
added to the original project. To enable the modified project to be completed and
the available funds to be disbursed, the Closing Date, initially set at 31 December
1984, was postponed until 31 December 1986 and the completion of disbursement of
the Credit was expected to be effected before 31 May 1987.
3.02   The construction programme underwent the following principal changes:
(a)    abandonment of the ENR dormitories when work on them had already
commenced; the buildings under construction were transformed into a 24
class laboratory school;
(b)    addition of a second phase of renovation and ehabilitation works at CNQP;
(c)    addition of the renovation of the teaching premises of the technical
secondary schools at Peytavin (Saint-Louis) and Delafosse (Dakar);
(d)    addition of a programme of construction of 86 classrooms for primary
education in the regions of Kolda and Tambacounda;
(e)    addition of a laboratory farm, agricultural buildings, a water tower and an
enclosure at INDR.
As a result of these modif ications, the total area of new buildings constructed with
the project funds increased by 34% (Annex 3).
Physical implementation
Sites
3.03   The choice of sites prior to the commencement of architectural design
studies, and their acquisition, posed no major problems. Only the distance of the
ENR from the town of Kolda created some operational difficulties; the boarding
facilities planned at the time of appraisal were abandoned, and pupils living in the
town spend a large part of their time travelling, as do the 800 pupils of the
laboratory school.
Architectural services
3.04   The architectural design studies, technical studies and monitoring of sites
were assigned to private consultants chosen by the Government and approved by
IDA.  For the 86 primary school classrooms, the architect was chosen by
competition, in association with a contractor.
3.05   The consultants generally carried out their work satisfactorily.  The
exceptions were the consultant chosen for repairs to the technical secondary
schools, whose imprecise documents had to be revised and corrected, causing time
overruns in the issuing of tender invitations and even the cancellation of the tender
of the lowest bidder in the case of the Delafosse technical secondary school.



- 8 -
3.06   Kolda (ENR).  The premises of traditional design, consist of several
buildings of between one and three floors. The laboratory school classrooms are
not really functional (for example, some of the windows are too high up) but they
were designed to make the best of buildings which were originally intended to serve
as dormitories.
3.07   Primary schools (86 classrooms). In 1982 a 66 classroom programme was
added to the project to make use of part of the funds available from the EEC
credit (011-SE) resulting from  an increase in the dollar exchange rate.  The
architect chosen on the basis of a competitive examination, proposed the
construction of schools using local materials and with the participation of the local
communities. After modification of the initial plans to reduce areas and eliminate
galleries, the cost reduction made it possible to extend the programme to 86
classrooms in 31 schools, each with one to three classrooms (Annex 4).
3.08   The buildings are made of stabilized earth with a vaulted roof of fired
bricks resting on -t ansverse arches.  During construction, the overall rigidity
proved inadequate. Cracks developed at the base of the arches, necessitating
underpinning of the foundations, strengthening of the lateral buttresses, and new
tie-beams. The cost of this additional work led the PIU to agree to the elimination
of the partitions and sanitary facilities originally planned. The use of vaulted roofs
ensures a comfortable temperature in the classrooms, but they give rise to a
certain amount of acoustic resonance which can be troublesome during lessons.
3.09   The project provided for the construction of three artisanal brickworks in
the area concerned. As dictated by the availability of the clay necessary for
making the bricks, a sing'e brickworks was built, thereby increasing transport costs
(some schools are located 350 kilometres from the brickworks). Nonetheless the
cost of the schools remains quite low (Annex 5) thanks to the use of local labour,
the help of local communities and the extensive use of local materials (stabilized
earth).
3.10   ENSETP. The premises as a whole, spread over several buildings of one to
four levels, are of traditional design, with the exception of the cafeteria, whose
structure of is laminated wood, and the library and audiovisual building, which is
polygonal in shape.  The choice of a central air-conditioning system  for the
audiovisual premises was a mistake; the system has never worked properly and
ENSETP is asking for it to be replaced by individual air-conditioners and for the
fixed window frames to be done away with.
3.11   ENSUT. The workshops and laboratories built with the project funds are
distributed among three buildings at ground level, of the same type of construction
as the existing ones.  The change in the original project purpose of certain
workshops poses problems of dust protection and permanent air-conditioning,
notably where electronic and data-processing equipment is concerned.
3.12   "'4DR.  There are several groups of buildings of one to three levels
distribu i according to function. The concrete structure, with hollow block filling
and fla )of, are of traditional design. The layout and design of the buildings are
generall) satisfactory, but the proportion of floor space allocated to circulation is
too high in relation to the working area, especially in the administration building.



-9 -
The increase in the unit contruction costs above appraisal estimates (Annex S) is
largely accounted for by the considerable number of external stairs, ramps and
walkways which are not part of the actual construction area. Furthermore, the
drainage system poses the following problems: (a) the protective gratings are of
too wide a mesh, allowing lizards to pass through and enter the premises; and (b)
the drainage of one of the dormitory buildings does not make allowances for the
gradient of the surrounding ground, and this causes flooding of the ground floor
during the rainy season.
3.13   ESGE/CESAG. The general design of the buildings is adequate. However,
the positioning of the library on the upper levels is undesirable, requiring structural
reinforcement for the deadweight of books and documents. The temperature inside
the hall, which has a partly glazed pyramidal roof, is unacceptably high.
3.14   Sports facilities. The project makes no provision for sports infrastructures
in any of the institutions, although equipment has generally been supplied. Some
work has been undertaken to provide football fields with the help of recurrent
budgets, but it is inadequate and incomplete.
Construction
3.15   All the project buildings were built by private contractors chosen in
accordance with IDA procedures. There was a time overrun of about six months in
the commencement of construction work which was due to slow and complicated
administrative procedures for the signing of contracts. Subsequently, work was held
up for several months because of delay in obtaining Government financing. In 1986
these difficulties again arose for the renovation of the technical secondary schools,
until the Government decided to use the remainder of an Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund credit to rneet part of its financing.
3.16   On the whole, the buildings constructed under the project are of good
quality. The following problems may however be noted:
(a)    problems in the erection of the vaulted roofs of the primary schools
resulted in a fatal accident for two workers on the Kedougou site, due to
the collapse of an arch and of the adjacent vault in course of construction.
Masons require training in this type of construction work and regular and
sustained supervision of the construction sites is also required;
(b)    renovation work on the two technical secondary schools was originally to
have been carried out during the school holidays. Time overruns in the
adjudication of tenders, the signing of contracts, and payments are
presently obliging the contractors to work during the months when the
schools are open, to the inconvenience of classes and difficulty in securing
the tools and equipment in the workshops;
(c)    at the time of the mission (March 1987) construction work was still in
progress on the sites of three components, with the proportion of work
completed as follows: Delafosse and Peytavin secondary schools, 70 per
cent; Kolda and Tambacounda primary schools, 70 per cent to 95 per cent;
and INDR (additional work): 75 per cent for the farm and water tower, 40
per cent for the enclosure.



- 10 -
lt is unlikely that work on these sites will be completed before 31 May
1987, the Closing Date of disbursements of Credits 908-SE and 01 1-SE. The
Government will therefore have to find additional funds to complete this
workl/;
(d)   the air-conditioning systems provided by the project do not generally work
satisfactorily, because of a design fault (ENSETP), lack of spare parts, and
lack of a maintenance and/or recurrent budget;
(e)   the over-sophisticated electrical circuits of INDR entail considerable
expenditure for the replacement of appliances that are worn out, damaged
or defective such as junction boxes, circuit-breakers arid miscellaneous
appliances;
(f)    part of the protection of the woodwork against termites at the ENR has
been poorly executed; consequently the wood needs to be treated by
soaking and not by application of anti-termite liquid with a brush;
(g)   in general, maintenance is inadequate because of lack of budgetary
resources. Some of the buildings are now three to four years old and are
beginning to show the effects of neglect of maintenance, notably in respect
of electricity, painting and plumbing.
Furniture
3.17   The furniture financed by the project was acquired by international
competitive bidding or local tendering between 1980 and 1985. A consultant
assisted in the design of the furniture for the primary schools; it has been
manufactured, and should be delivered as soon as the school buildings are
completed. On the whole, the furniture that has already been delivered is well
suited to its conditions of use and corresponds to the needs of the users. Lists and
quantities were prepared by PIU and proved sufficient for most of the premises.
Equipment
3.18   Lists, specifications and quantities of equipment to be provided under the
project were prepared by the PIU with the help of a consultant specialized in
contracting and in consultation with the future users of the equipment.
3.19   Equipment was acquired by international competitive bidding between 1980
and 1983. A second series of bid invitations was launched in 1985 for additio:
equipment for ENSETP, INEADE, CNQP and the two technical secondary schools in
order to make use of part of the newly available Credit proceeds resulting from the
increase in the dollar exchange rates.
3.20   On the whole, the equipment supplied is suitable for the needs of its users.
The following remarks may, however, be made:
(a)   the heavy workshop equipment is robust and adequate, but the light
equipment and tools for the workshop, kitchen and administration are in
many cases fragile and the heavy kitchen equipment is too sophisticated;
1/    In a note dated 18 July 1987, the Ministry of Education indicated that the
work was completed by 30 June 1987.



- Il -
(b)    equipment delivered often did not include spare parts and in some cases,
there is no manufacturer's agent in the country. A fresh order takes six to
eight months, during which time the equipment cannot operate. This
applies to photocopiers, refrigerators and electrical equipment for
example. There is a lack of accessories for the heavy equipment (belts,
sandpapering strips, milling tools, chucks, blades, etc.);
(c)   the operating budgets are insufficient and do not allow tools, spare parts
and working materials to be replaced in sufficient quantity.  The
maintenance contracts initially paid for out of the project funds are
cancelled when the institution does not have a sufficient budget to renew
them;
(d)    it was only after the delivery of the first items of equipment for the
technical secondary schools that the state of the premises in which they
were to be installed was realized: inadequate electrical circuits and
lighting, lack of protection against theft, finishing work needing to be done
again, and inadequate dimensio .s. The renovation work agreed in April
1984 has still not been completed, and the equipment delivered is only
partially in use, and under poor conditions;
(e)    thefts of tools and equipment have obliged the technical secondary schools
and the CNQP to increase the height of their surrounding walls and
strengthen the protective gratings.
Technical assistance
General remarks
3.21   On the  whole, this component of the project was implemented
satisfactorily in quantitative terms (see Annex 6) (and to a fair extent qualitatively
also), apart from the fellowships in the primary education sub-components and
INDR and the expert services for ENSETP and the two technical secondary schools.
Use of local fellowships for staff training for primary education was practically
negligible, whereas provison had been made for 40 man/years under this heading.
For the non-PIU section of the project, out of a total of about 90 man/years of
expert services and 77 man/years of fellowships (including 42 for local training),
use was made of 87 man/years of expert services and 13 man/years of fellowships.
3.22   On-the-spot refresher training of 1,200 primary schools teachers and
principals did not take place. Nevertheless, some local training was provided for
teachers and for other purposes connected with the project, such as seminars in the
context of school mapping for teacher training, another seminar on the cost and
financing of education, and 27 man/months devoted to the training of senior staff
for the CNQP.  There were considerable delays in respect of several TA
components (about three to four years) because sub-projects were implemented
more slowly than planned, because of additional time required for the completion
of construction work, and also because of a lack of dynamism on the part of those
responsible for certain components and the slowness of certain recruitment
procedures. This had negative consequences for some components and caused
frustration among local personnel and among experts who arrived at a difficult or
inopporture moment.  In some cases, it delayed the training of counterpart
personnel. The non-utilization of fellowships available under the project was
particularly striking in the case of INDR and considerably delayed the
Senegalization of the educators of this institute.



- 12 -
3.23   One lesson that seems to emerge from the implementation of the technical
assistance component of the project, and which corresponds to the view of local
officials and Unesco personnel based in Dakarl/, is that for the specific training
objectives of this project, more emphasis should have been placed on on-the-spot
training as opposed to fellowships for training abroad. It also appears that more
attention could be paid to the use of local expertise, particularly in the sphere of
national languages, and that, in this case, a certain flexibility would have been
desirable in order to make the remuneration of Senegalese experts more attractive.
3.24   Lastlys as in the case of the Second Education Project (Cr. 530-SE), the
way in which the accounts are presented by the PIU does not make it possible to
isolate the various elements of this component, in particular to distinguish between
consultant services and training activities (fellowships for study abroad, on-the-
spot training). This is due partly to the definition of the categories in the Credit
Agreement2/, partly to inadequate accounting, and partly to lack of co-ordination
at the level of the PIU.
Services provided by experts and consultants
3.25   Unesco was the supplier of TA for the primary education and educational
research and planning component. There was an almost total void during the start-
up period of the project. Only three Unesco experts were on the spot in 1979, two
of them being concerned with the Second Project (evaluation and maintenance of
the scientific and technical blocks) and the third being in charge of school mapping.
After the visit of four Unesco consultants for periods of two to six weeks in
connection with school television up to June, 1981, it was not until February 1983
that a single Unesco expert was appointed as assistant to the director of the
INEADE. Subsequently, with effect from 1984, technical assistance was stepped up,
particularly by the appointment of a specialist to provide planning assistance for
the DRP and a specialist in national languages for INEADE; and in 1985 (more than
five years late) a teacher training expert arrived. An expert in school mapping for
DRP was not appointed until 1986. Prior to that, school mapping was not
efficiently done.
3.26   The quality of this later technical assistance provided by Unesco was
particularly appreciated by the national authorities. There were also quite a few
consultants drawn from many different sources who successfully prepared plans for
the follow-on education project, as well as a consultant from Unesco Headquarters
to organize a seminar on school mapping.
3.27   For the CNQP component, a contract was signed with ILO, and, with effect
from 1980, a dozen or so experts were on the spot, working as teachers in the
various courses helping to achieve satisfactory operation of the institution.
3.28   Two consultants carried out work of a legal and organizational nature in
connection with the creation of the ONFP.
1/    Members of the Unesco Regional Office for Education in Africa (BREDA).
2/    Fellowships and consultant services form a single category.



- 13 -
3.29   ESGE which has since become CESAG benefited from six specialists from
1980 to 1985, four of them provided by Canadian assistance (CEGIR) and several
consultants some of whom were drawn from the same source. On the whole, those
in charge of the school were very satisfied with this expertise. They had been
deeply involved in the choice of the experts and considered this to be a determining
factor in the success achieved.
3.30   With regard to INDR, assistance began very slowly. i'.z.a. was nothing in
1979 and the programme started with an assistant to the Director of the Institute
in October, 1980. This was followed by the appointment of a Director of studies
two years later, in October 1982. The first expert for the various subjects in the
Institute's curriculum did not arrive until 1984, followed by four experts in 1985.
Three of these experts were from CEGIR and two of them left their post at INDR
before the end of their contract.
Covenants of the Credit Agreement
3.31   The Credit Agreement comprised various convenants, the majority of
which were fully implemented, others being partially implemented (see Annex 7).
The only noteworthy shortcomings were as follows:
(a)    delays in promulgation of laws and decrees establishing the institutions
INEADE, INDR, ENSETP and ESGE.  The Credit Agreement fixed
November 1979 (less than 18 months after Credit Signature) as the
deadline. Experience in several projects has shown that these legal
provisions required substantially more time to be finalised than is usually
allowed in the implementation schedule;
(b)   the adequate staffing of the PIU (which was without an accountant and
deputy director in 1985 and 1986);
(c)    coordination of all educational research under INEADE and providing
INEADE with buildings and a budget before 30 June 1980. While the
functions have been transferred to INEADE, it lacks adequate physical
facilities and needs some strengthening of its technical capacity; and
(d)    tracer system for graduates of ENSET, INDR and ESGE. ENSET does not
systematically trace its graduates. INDR has had no graduates so far and
ESGE - now CESAG - traces its graduates.

IV. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
Project Costs
4.01   The appraisal mission estimated the project cost at US$33.1 million or
FCFA 7,293 million, including US$20.9 million in foreign exchange (representing
about 63 per cent of the total).
Actual Costs
4.02   It has not been possible to obtain a satisfactory balance-sheet of the
actual Project costs because the Project accounting was incomplete, scattered
and imprecise; the information obtained from the various departments was
sometimes contradictory and did not correspond to that obtained in Washington
or at the French Development Fund office in Dakarl/.
4.03   The project cost at the time of the Completion mission in March 1987 is
estimated at US$27.8 million or FCFA 9,640 million.  This represents a
16 per cent underrun in US$ terms and a 32 per cent overrun in FCFA (see
Annex 8).

Average Exchange Rate        220         346       + 126      + 57.3
(FCFA per US$)
4.04   The global cost of the Project by category is summarised in Table 4.2
below and the detailed costs appears in Annex 8.
1/    In order to obtain as exact an estimate as possible of costs in the two
currencies, the estimation has been made in the following way:
-      an average annual exchange rate has been calculated (Key Project Data,
Country Exchange Rates) on the basis of disbursement statements obtained
in Washington;
-      using the disbursement schedules and the annual exchange rates, a total
equivalent cost in FCFA has been calculated for Credits 908-SE and
011-SE and a reverse operation has been done for the French Development
Fund credit, disbursements of which were made in francs;
-      the average exchange rate for each financing was then calculated on the
basis of the results obtained, permitting the conversion of each expense
category into FCFA (or into US$ for the French Development Fund).

Total                   33.14    100.0           27.83    100.0
4.05   In the present state of Project accounts, it has not been possible to
estimate the costs of the Project by component.
4.06   The major differences between the actual Project cost and the appraisal
estimates are due to the following factors:
(a)    a sharp increase in the dollar exchange rate from FCFA 220 at the time of
appraisal to FCFA 500 in 1984, before it fell back to FCFA 305 at the time
of the Completion Mission; this effectively reduced costs in FCFA and
generated savings which were used to add new buildings and acquire
additional equipment; and
(b)    considerable time overruns in implementation (three years for Credits 908-
SE and the French Development Fund, five and a half years for Credit
011-SE) causing an increase in the proportion represented by the price
increases in the Project costs in FCFA.
Unit Costs
4.07   The unit costs of construction (Annex 5) in US$ are all less than the
appraisal estimates. This difference corresponds broadly to the increase in the US$
exchange rate during construction.
4.08   Unit costs in FCFA have increased by comparison with the basic cost
estimated at appraisal except for those of the ENR in Kolda which decreased by six
per cent, revealing their over-estimation at the time of appraisal.
4.09   The increase in cost in FCFA corresponds approximately to the estimated
increase in prices (24 per cent), except in the case of the INDR, where the increase
(36 per cent) is due to a coscly architectural design and an increase in the
construction area actually provided compared with that planned.
4.10   Because of the manner in which the Project accounts were kept, it has
been impossible for the mission to ascertain the actual unit costs of furniture and
equipment by component.



- 17 -
Financing
4.11   The variation in exchange rates and the proportion of funds which cannot
be disbursed before 31 May, 19B7 have changed the percentage distribution of
Project financing. The IDA share has increased by 6.5 per cent, financing by
Government and the French Development Fund declined by 2.5 per cent and 3.0 per
cent respectively (because of the fall in the value of the FCFA in relation to the
US$) and the European Commurity financing has declined by one per cent because
some 22 per cent of the Credit V 1 1 was unused.

4.12   Part of the Government financing was covered by an OPEC  loan
necessitated by difficulties experienced by the Government. These difficulties
delayed and constrained implementation of several components and OPEC
participation made it possible for the Government to incut, more expenditure
before the Closing Date.

4.13   The comparative schedule of disbursements (Annex 9) reveals serious
delays right from the start of the Project in the case of Credit 908-SE and a two-
year delay in the first disbursements of Credit 011-SE. These are explained by
over-optimistic estimates (especially in the case of Credit 01 1-SE), difficulties in
the administration of the Project, shortage of Government financing, and the
increase in the USS exchange rate.
4.14   It is estimated that on 31 May 1987 - the Closing Date for disbursements
from Credits 908-SE and 011-SE - about US$ 1.8 million will be cancelled from the
IDA Credit (eight per cent), and US$1 million from the EEC credit (22 per cent). As
regards the French Development Fund credit, the closing date, at present fixed at
31 December, 1987, will be postponed until the funds are exhausted.

V. IDA PERFORMANCE
Proiect Generation
5.01  In certain respects, IDA must share in the responsibility for some design
shortcomings which are clearer today in hindsight. Despite difficulties experienced
in the implementation of the first two projects, a complicated Third Project was
designed, comprising a large number of separate components and sub-components
and dividing responsibility for implementing the pedagogical and technical
assistance aspects amongst several ministries. No remedial steps were proposed to
overcome (a) the weakness observed during the implementation of the Second
Project and (b) lack of an official in the Project Unit in the Ministry of Public
Works with responsibility for coordinating the pedagogical and technical assistance
aspects.  Moreover, insofar as the primary education and teacher training
component was concerned, no clearcut policy decisions had been taken at the time
of Credit Signature which would have made it possible to anticipate the outcome of
the educational reforms in gestation. On the whole, what was proposed was
technically sound. However expectations as to what could have been accomplished
needed to have been more modest and implementation arrangements more specific.
Project Supervision
5.02   During the eight years of Project implementation, there were 15
supervisory missions - one every 6.4 months. The average time devoted by them to
the Third Project was 15.3 days. Twelve of these missions included an architect,
eleven an economist, seven a general educator, three an agricultural educator, two
a technical educator and one a management expert, reflecting an emphasis on
physical aspects and less attention to the specialised technical aspects of the
Project.
5.03   There was regular follow-up by the general educator.  However, an
agricultural educator was absent during the three central years of Project
implementation despite the problems being experienced by INDR. The follow-up in
supervision and in the general monitoring of such an important component as
technical education and its several sub-components - ENSETP (Higher Training
College for Technical and Vocational Teachers), the two upper technical secondary
schools and the ENSUT - which required close liaison and coordination, was also
deficient (para 6.21).
5.04  In other respects, IDA monitoring of implementation was thorough and, on
the whole, IDA assisted considerably in facilitating and supporting the
implementation process.

VI. OPERATION OF PROJECT INSTITUTIONS
6.01   The operation of the Project components must be seen in the present
context of the structural adjustment programme of Senegal for the period 1985-
1992, which is aimed at ensuring better allocation and utilisation of resources.
Furthermore, within this general framework, a far-reaching reform of the
educational sector -the New School - has been launched, with the fundamental aim
of establishing an education system that is fair, efficient and adapted to the
national development needs. The main objectives of the reform are as follows:
(a)   to give absolute priority to the development of basic education;
(b)    to use existing physical and human resources more efficiently; and
(c)   to develop institutional structures that will help improve the standards and
adaptability of education to national needs.
Primary Education and Educational Planning and Research
6.02   The primary education and planning and research component of the Project
was rather complex and was broken up into sub-components within MEN. This
component alone comprised one half of the 32 headings in the total of f ive
components as described in the Credit Agreement.
6.03   The task was:
(a)   to establish INEADE (National Institute of Study and Action for
Educational Development) as the MEN instrument to prepare, test,
evaluate and implement the reforms, conduct research in curricula to
facilitate the adoption of innovations, and to conduct training and
retraining seminars, and studies and surveys;
(b)   to strengthen the Department of Research and Planning in MEN in order to
assist the Ministry in defining broad future orientations;
(c)   to build a regional Teacher Training College (ENR) at Koldal' in order to
regionalise the pre-service and in-service training of teachers; and
(d)    following the change in Project content, to build "pedagogical laboratory"
classrooms in the ENR as well as 86 primary classrooms in the Kolda and
Tambacounda regions.
1/    To replace the one at Thies.



- 22 -
a)  National Institute of Study and Action for Educational Development
(INEADE)
6.04   The INEADE sub-component has not fully achieved the planned objectives.
The several reasons include organisational problems in MEN, disputes about spheres
of competence with the Department of Primary Education (DEE), underutilisation
of TA expertsl/ (especially during the initial years), the non-utilisation of
fellowships abroad, and the very incomplete training of counterparts. Furthermore,
partly because INEADE staff were insufficiently imbued with the aims of INEADE,
there was a certain amount of uncertainty in pursuing the activities and in using
this staff. The fact that the educational policy context was in a state of flux is no
doubt a mitigating factor. It was only in July 1984 that the Reform Commissions
set up by the States General for Education in 1981 submitted their findings and
recommendations2/. The institutional strengthening of the Institute was therefore
not as satisfactorily achieved and its activities were therefore not as intensive as
was expected at appraisal.
6.0S   The responsibilities of INEADE in the introduction of the national
languages were reduced to a minimum. Implementation of certain elements of this
component has been abandoned, including the linguistic preparation of new
curricula in Wolof, Poular and S&erre intended for experimental classes, the
organisation of training seminars for teachers supposed to participate in the pilot
experiment of teaching in national languages, and the seminars for retraining about
1,200 teachers and principals. Likewise the study of education in Arabic and of the
role which the Koranic schools could play in increasing the rate of schooling has
not been carried through to a successful conclusion.
6.06   The activities of INEADE, however, were not negligible, even if they were
not, as a rule, very action-oriented. Some 80 reports, studies and research papers
produced between 1981 and 1987 are now available. The present staff amounts to
34 professionals including former inspectors and assistant inspectors of elementary
education, trained teachers, educational mediator and school and vocational
guidance counsellor. For most of the 1986/87 year, there has been a new director
of high standard who seems capable of dynamising the Institute and its staff and
who has already established regular links with the Secondary Teacher Training
College (ENS).
b)   Research and Planning Directorate (DRP)i/
6.07   Although it was late in coming, there has been a definite institutional
strengthening of DRP which augurs well for the implementation of Credit 1735-SE.
The strengthening of DRP was an objective of the Second Project that was only
partly achieved. Annex 9 provides the present organisation chart of DRP.
1/    Out of the 40 man/years of experts and 24 man/months of consultants
available to it, the Institute has used slightly more than 25 per cent of the
provision for experts and six per cent of the provision for consultants.
2/    These recommendations started to be applied only in July 1985.
3/    Since the restructuring of MEN, this Directorate is called the "Directorate
for Studies and Human Resources and Planning" (DERP).



-23 -
6.08   DRP used 10.25 man/years of expert services as well as four man/months
of consultant servicesl/. It has benefitted from 21 man/months of fellowships, so
that, at the central level, the DRP enjoys the services of four officials trained at
the LJnesco International Institute of Educational Planning (IIEP), in school
mapping, educational statistics, educational planning and extra-mural education.
At the local level, the regional and departmental inspectorates have been alerted
to educational planning problems. In each of the 10 regional and 41 departmental
inspectorates of elementary education, there is an operational statistics and school
mapping unit which has benefitted from training courses and project supplied
equipment, such as calculators, reproduction equipment, notice boards and sets of
maps.
6.09   Several seminars have been organised by DRP since May 1984 to provide
training for Senegalese personnel. They comprised seminars on introduction to
statistics and school mapping and an international seminar on educational costs
and financing organised in cooperation with Unesco and the Conference of African
Ministers of Education in which 20 Senegalese officials from the central
administration and regional education authorities took part. Several further
seminars are planned to be held in the framework of the Project in 1987, with a
view to integrating the school map into the planning process and extending it to
urban zones and post-primary levels.
6.10   The expert recruited for DRP in 1984 (and at present on transfer to the
Project Unit) was put in charge of supervising the production of 14 studies related
to Credit 173S-SE.  These studies have been produced by the departments
concerned in MEN (with the assistance of consultants) and by the Minister's
technical adviser.
c)   Regtional Teacher Training Collese (ENR)
6.11   The Regional Teacher Training College (ENR). at Kolda was opened in 1983.
A change of policy abolishing residential accommodation led to the replacement of
the dormitories provided for under the project by a laboratory school of 24
classrooms.
6.12   So far ENR has been somewhat under-utilised. In 1986/87 there were 180
teacher trainees in the complement of 240 places. But there were 60 entrants in
1986/87 and another 60 are expected for the start of the 1987/88 academic year.
This will regularise the situation at the start of the 1989/90 academic year when
the total strength will approximate to the 240 places. As of now, the school is
already supplying 36 per cent of the total Senegal output of newly trained teachers.
There are 33 trainers which would produce a trainee:trainer ratio of 7.3:1 in
1989/90. The Minister of Education is anxious to see the school fully utilised and
favours its use to provide retraining for teachers  from the three regions of
Ziguinchor, Kolda and Tambacounda as well as for training seminars for the New
School teacherl/.
1/    A school mapping expert is continuing his work until the end of June, 1987.
2/    The name New School has been used to describe the reform  of the
education system begun in January 1981 with the holding of the States
General of Education and continued with the work of the National
Commission for the Reform of Education and Training up to July 1984. This
reform began to be applied in July 1985.



- 24 -
6.13   ENR was unable to benefit during the early phases of its establishment
from the work of the expert in teacher training and innovation techniques, whose
recruitment was originally planned for the end of 1979, because he was recruited
late.
6.14   Primary school enrolments in the Kolda and Tambacounda regions, where
the 86 classrooms are being provided or have been provided, have been growing
steadily between 1981/82 and 1986/87 with an annual growth of several thousand
pupils representing altogether nearly 15,939 more pupils in 1986/87 - an increase of
almost 62 per cent over the 1981/82 figures to reach 25,773 pupils in 1986/87.
Higher TraininR College for Technical Teachers (ENSETP) and the Equipment of
Two Secondary Technical Schools
(a)    ENSETP
6.15   ENSETP opened in its new buildings in October 1982 and, on the whole, has
been operating according to the norms of administrative and pedagogical
organisation that correspond to the working papers.  After very selective
recruitment of students - about five per cent of the applicants were accepted -
there is a one-year common-core syllabus for teacher trainees destined for the
lower secondary level (grades 7 to 10) and the upper secondary level (grades 11 to
13). After this course, there are two separate programmes for the two categories
of future teachers. For the future lower secondary teachers, there are two years
of technical training followed by a year of practical (pedagogical) training. For the
trainees destined for upper secondary teaching, there are three years of technical
training followed by one year of practical pedagogical training. For the latter,
these four years are provided at the National University School of Technology
(ENS UT) in respect of  the three industrial sections of machine-building,
electrotechnics and industrial manufacturing. A considerable amount of time is
allocated in the time tables of the various sections to practical work. In all cases,
except that of quantitative management techniques, more than 50 per cent of the
time is devoted to practical work (see Annex 10). Moreover those in the industrial
sections undergo practical training in factories during the school holidays.
6.16   Only 34 ENSETP trainees were enrolled at ENSUT in 1986/87 compared
with the 160 envisaged at appraisal. With an enrolment of 159 trainees in 1986/87,
ENSETP intended for 180 trainees, is also under-utilised. Since 1982/83, ENSETP
has produced 111 graduates, 43 of them in the industrial and technological sections
and the remainder in home economics, administrative methods and quantitative
management techniques. The teaching staff consists of 45 persons (including 10
Senegalese) which gives a very low trainee/trainer ratio of 4.3/1. The cost per
student year is around US$675 including operating expenses, staff salaries and
student bursaries.
6.17   The regional role of ENSETP (training persons from other countries) could
be encouraged - nearly a quarter of the trainees in 1987 came from the outside
Senegal - and this could make up for the financial constraints which have limited
the intake of Senegal trainees  to 40 per year.  According to the school
management, the school can be authorised to serve private firms, the ENSUT, the
CNQP, and so on, and contacts have already been made. There is also a plan for
training Senegalese staff. An agreement with the Higher Teacher Training College
at Cachan (France) provides training courses for Senegalese leading to higher
degrees such as CAPET and Aggregation.



- 25 -
(b)    Technical Secondary Schools
. The Peyta in Technical Secondary School at Saint-Loulls
6.18   The Peytavin Technical Secondary School has been provided with
equipment for six workshops which will operate in satisfactory conditions, if the
work can be completed before 31 May 1987. The classroom and practical work
curricula are the same as those in France, namely, an average of 16.5 per cent of
practical work for the upper technical secondary school programme, 31 per cent
for the Vocational Education Centre - CEP (technician's certificate) and over 50
per cent  for the technical education certif icate.  The success rates in
Baccalaureat sections B and El/ were 33.5 and 82.5 per cent respectively in 1986.
6.19   The teaching staff consists of 20 persons, including 15 expatriates, which
gives a student/teacher ratio of 11.7/1. In 1986/87, there were 234 pupils,
Including 53 in the final year Baccalaureat classes. Of last year's leavers, six were
admitted to ENSETP, one to ENSUT, one to the Merchant Marine Institute and two
to the Science Faculty of the University. Most of the graduates holding the
Section F2/ Baccalaur6at enter into production activities in Dakar or Thies. The
operating budget (not including teacher salaries or student grants) amounted to
about FCFA 16.35 million in 1985/86 and to FCFA 24 million In 1986/87, or about
US$342 per student/year and the overall cost per student/year including staff
salaries and student bursaries is estimated at US$2,130.
Delafosse Upper Secondary School (Dakar)
6.20   The Delafosse Upper Secondary School has been supplied with equipment
for eight workshops and laboratories which will operate in satisfactory conditions if
the installation can be completed before 31 May 1987. The industrial technical
programme which forms part of the Delafosse School provides three series of
courses - the technician  Baccalaureat course (Sections Fl to  F7), the
mathematical/technical course and the technician's certificate course. At the
time of the Completion mission, there was a total of 26 classes and 484 pupils, of
whom 118 were in their final year. The success rate in the final year varies
between 65 and 70 per cent. Pupils equipped with the technician's certificate enter
the job market while holders of the baccalaureat enter either the university or -
after exacting tests - the ENSETP or the ENSUT. There is a teaching staff of 73
(59 per cent being expatriates), which gives a rather low student/teacher ratio of
6.7/1. Operating budget amounts to FCFA 74 million in 1986/87, excluding student
bursaries and teachers' salaries, or about US$510 per student/year and the overall
cost oer student/year including staff salaries and student bursaries is estimated at
US$3,000.
6.21   The six man/years of technical assistance provided for the technical
education component of the Project, which might have been useful either to help
orient the content of ENSETP courses or to revise the content of the syllabuses in
the secondary technical schools, were not used. Nevertheless, the Intention to use
this technical assistance was expressed on the occasion of an IDA supervision in
April 1982, but the idea was abandoned afterwards, for reasons which are not clear.
The period during which the State Secretariat for Technical Education was in
charge of this component was not a particularly favorable one. Furthermore, the
1/    Section B concerns Economic studies and Section E Scientific studies.
2/    Section F concerns Technical studies.



- 26 -
implementation of this component of the Project probably suffered from the
failure to follow up the April 1982 IDA Supervision mission's recommendation
indicating the need for attention by expert technical educators during subsequent
supervision missions.
National University School of Technology (ENSUT)
6.22   The laboratories, workshops, classrooms and equipment provided by the
Project have been installed and are functioning normally. However, the enrolment
of trainee/teachers was smaller than that initially envisaged (para 6.16). There is
no formal structure linking ENSUT (which has the status of a university institute)
with ENSETP (which is attached to MEN) and it appears that more sustained
cooperation would be of advantage to both institutions. ENSUT has a large and very
diversified teaching staff of more than 100 persons employed full-time (of whom
nearly half are Senegalese) and 44 Senegalese employed under term-contracts. It
appears to have good internal efficiency, about 83 per cent passing the DUT
examination and 96 per cent the DIT examination in 1985/86. Some 45 per cent of
the students came from other countries, and 20 per cent of the enrolment was
female in 1986/87. The tracer study by ENSlUT reveals a very satisfactory
absorption of graduates into the job market, albeit somewhat more difficult now
than in the past because of the economic situation.
6.23   This school, formerly known as the University Institute of Technology
(IUT), had been established under the First Education Project (Credit 23S-SE). It
has established solid links with industry, stresses practical training, (including
practice periods in enterprises throughout the training programme), has dynamic
students with a spirit of enterprise, partly finances itself from some of its
activities and has a substantial opcrating budget, largely supported at present by
France.
National Vocational Traininr Centre (CNQP)
6.24   CNQP results from the merger of the CFPP (Centre for Training and
Continuous Training) with the nearby CEP (Vocational Training Centrel/). CFPP
had received financial assistance from the Second Education Project (Credit 530-
SE) and, in view of its promising results, it was decided to reinforce it under the
Third Project, along with UNDP assistance, with the additional aim of training
school leavers for skilled jobs. In February 1983, the Centre was granted the status
of public establishment of an administrative type, which gives it financial and
pedagogical autonomy.
6.25   The upgrading (in-service training) section still includes the three functions
described in the Completion Report of the Second Education Project (Credit 530-
SE), namely, (a) programmed modular training course, (b) free-choice training
courses and (c) training advice for entreprises. The Centre has met the training
needs of enterprises by opening two new sections for the start of the 1986/87
school year - industrial hydraulics and mini-computers. The carpentry section is
1/    Itself a derivation of the former Industrial Training Centre of Dakar
(CQID).



- 27 -
about to be opened and a trainer training section is available, where CNQP can
prepare specially tailored programmes for (i) training instructors and group leaders
- professionals who will receive psycho-pedagogical preparation for teaching their
subjects and (ii) further training of trainers in the modular approach, in order to
design and produce educational and teaching material. For all its specialisations,
the Centre has designed 124 operational modules of 30 to 120 hours. The upgrading
programme, which showed spectacular development since the Second Education
Project, has remained at practically the same level and should continue at about
37,000 trainee-hours for the current year 1986/87. In the framework of its advisory
role in training, the Centre has negotiated training schemes of some importance
with several large enterprises. In collaboration with Senegalese and Nige.ian firms,
an analysis has been conducted of groups to be trained, training objectives have
been determined, a training programme has been prepared, teaching material has
been produced and the training has been implemented.
6.26   These objectives for training plans have been translated into 22,600 actual
trainee/hours in 1985/86, while nearly 16,000 trainee/hours of training had been
given in 1986/87 up to the time of the Completion Mission visit.
6.27   Pre-employment training (see Annex I1) was started in October 1984 on a
three-year experimental basis. It is based on a school/enterprise alternation
system from the second year onwards. Specialisation is provided in the third year
either in general engineering, electrotechnics, metalwork, or motor mechanics. At
present, 251 trainees are being catered for - 96 in the first year, 78 in the second
and 77 in the third. Selection tests are demanding. There were 700 candidates for
admission to the Centre this year. The work of grading the diploma issued by the
Centre in the scale of State diplomas and the negotiations to grade the certificate
of qualification in the vocational hierarchy scale should be completed by July 1987.
6.28   Apart from the three technical advisers who have assisted the director, in
turn, a total of 12 foreign experts, all from ILO, have served the Centre as
teachers under the Project. Consultants have been engaged to prepare a study of
ONFP (National Vocational Training Organisation) and 15 fellowship-holders were
sent abroad between 1982 and 1985. In 1986, it was rightly decided to train nine
Senegalese on the spot. This practical technical and pedagogical training took
place in CNQP (National Centre for Vocational Training) throughout 1986 and was
supplemented by a 2.5 month course in the methodology of training, organised and
conducted by an expert from the ILO (Turin). Thus, despite the attrition of five
fellowship-holders who have been given important jobs elsewhere, Senegalisation of
the teaching staff has been well launched. At the present time, the Centre has 35
teachers, of whom 26 are Senegalese, six from the French technical assistance
mission, and three experts from ILO.
6.29   This year, the budget for the Centre is estimated at FCFA 158.6 million,
consisting of a State subsidy of nearly 120 million and receipts of nearly 39 million
derived mainly from the department responsible for in-service training. Receipts
had increased by six per cent over the previous year but do not make up for the
reduction in the State subsidy. In the long run, shortage of recurrent funding could
become a serious constraint upon the activities of the Centre. Nevertheless new
self-financing activities are planned and it is hoped to develop the potential of the
Centre to serve other countries in the region.       1
6.30   The dynamism of CNQP and the positive results obtained so far are largely
due to (a) the structure of the Centre, which includes a tripartite Governing Board
(Government, employers, employees) and (b) its approach to traininp, which



- 28 -
involves a permanent liaison between the Centre and the enterprise for the
definition and implementation of training and/or upgrading programmes, in which
both the employer and worker are equally interested.
6.31   The foilow-up of trainees in the enterprise after their training or
upgrading, the development of which is not very advanced so far, needs to be
encouraged. The recent establishment of the National Organisation for Vocational
Training (ONFP) (Law of 11 August, 1986) may assist in this direction. The serious
delay (six years after the original decision was taken by the President of the
Republic) in the establishment of this body, which has the status of a public
industrial and commercial body, was mainly due to (a) the need for certain
preliminary studies of a legal and organisational nature and (b) jurisdictional
conflicts among Government departments.
6.32   The preamble to the Law creating ONFP refers to the Organisation as "a
privileged technical instrument available to the Government and the socio-
professional partners for defining sectoral and operational training objectives,
implementing training plans and programmes and assessing achievements".
6.33   The Organisation has a variety of resources including (i) receipts from the
fixed contribution of employers, (ii) the proceeds of services provided for
enterprises, private bodies and public authorities, (iii) State subsidies, donations
and legacies, as well as (iv) funds derived from foreign aid for the implementation
of specific programmes. Presumably the Organisation, together with the newly
created Directorate of Vocational Training in the Ministry of Education, will be
able to play a normative, coordinating and stimulatory role in the field of
vocational training, and will be able to make existing or future training facilities in
Senegal more economical, relevant to needs and complementary to one another.
National Institute of Rural Development (INDR)
6.34   INDR, whose operation is governed by a decree derived from the Law of 1
July 1980, became operational only at the beginning of 19831/, after difficulties
arising from personality problems, delays in recruiting of the TA experts, poor
utilisation of fellowships (only one was used between 1983 and 1985), slowness in
recruiting teachers and in the delivery of equipment, and difficulties in securing an
adequate operating budget.  While the IDA supervision mission of mid-1981
expected a more dynamic start and hoped for the solution of many of the problems,
the supervisory mission at the beginning of 1985 found that no serious plan had
been produced for developing INDR activities. Even today, after three years of
operation in its new premises, there are still serious problems in making the
Institute efficient.
6.35   The academic year starts in January and lasts until November.  The
candidates for admission must possess at least the Baccalaureat in Mathemathics
or Science (completed Grade 13). The programme lasts five years.
6.36   The numbers admitted fluctuate widely from year to year. Enrolments in
1987 are as follows:
1/    During its preparatory years, the Institute was located in Dakar University.
It was later established on a site five km from Thlis.

6.37   The Project Completion mission supports the view of the INDR directorate
who would like to see recruitment of pupils based on medium-term planning
conducted by consultation between the INDR and its supervising Ministry. In
particular it is felt that the level of admission could be at the third year, with the
present two years of basic science studies in the Institute at first and second year
level eliminated (along with some 20 teachers employed under contract)l/. It is
also felt that, through a competitive examination, students could be admitted in
addition to the quota determined by the Government for the Public Service. This
would make it possible to train persons more clearly for the private sector.
Moreover, by postponing the selection of the persons for Government jobs until
completion (instead of at the start) of the course, the performance of students
might be impreved.

SenegaleseV/, and some fifty teachers under contract, the student/teacher ratio is
1.2/1, which is unacceptably expensive.
6.39   With an operating budget of some FCFA 300 million, the 56 students at
present in the school cost the prohibitive figure of FCFA 5.3 million, or about
US$17,670 per student/year, excluding teachers' salaries and student bursaries. This
compares unfavorably with unit costs in equivalent institutions in neighbouring
countries, which vary between FCFA 1.6 million and 1.9 million. The Institute
Directorate recognises the seriousness of this unit cost problem and recommends a
change in favour of permanent teachers as well as special budget provisions to
permit recruitment of good quality teachers. They also wish to see medium-term
planning with outside help, with the aim of Senegalising the staff. However, it is
clear that much more is needed, especially to increase enrolments.
6.40   As regards the teaching policy and aims of INDR, the brain storming
seminar at Saly3/ in 1986 confirmed that INDR should train upper level as well as
middle level professionals in agriculture.
6.41   The aims of INDR must be seen in the present context of Senegal, where
agriculture is undergoing extensive transformation, and the economic crisis,
together with drought, has led the Government to design a new agricultural policy
(NPA) aimed at giving more responsibility to the farmer and at encouraging private
I/    The two year science programme could be done more efficiently elsewhere
in the university.
2/    At present two Senegalese are receiving further training  abroad
(FAC/fellowship-holders) and four additional Senegalese teachers are being
recruited.
3/    Held in April 1986 under the chairmanship of the Minister of Education,
this Seminar made some important recommendations concerning INDR
which were endorsed by the INDR's Governing Board.

enterprise. The intention is, therefore, to train not only a new type of trainer-
supervisor, but especially "land entrepreneurs"' capable of designing projects and
managing them  efficiently.  The 1986 seminar seems to have had a highly
invigorating effect on INDR. Following that Seminar:
(a)   three draft decreesS/ have been approved by the Governing Board of INDR
and transmitted to the supervising Ministry;
(b)   the new specialisations at the fifth year level will be introduced in 1987
and will eliminate the need to finance costly fellowships for training
abroad;
(c)    a draft structure for in-service training of agronomists, which is essential
for the new agricultural policy, has been prepared and is expected to be
operational in 1988;
(d)   the laboratory centre is expected to be in operation by September 1987
and, in addition to strengthening the practical training of future students,
it should enable recovery of about 40 per cent of costs to be achieved;
'e)    the institute will be extensively open to foreigners.
6.42   INDR is still fragile and not very economical to operate, and a major
management effort is needed if it is to achieve its objectives.
Hither School of Management (ESGE/CESAG)
6.43   ESGE began operatien in October 1982, transferred to its new premises in
1982. In September 1985 it ceased to be under the supervision of the Ministry for
Higher Education and was placed under the Ministry for National Education. It
enjoyed the status of a public institution of an administrative character since the
passing of the Law  of I July, 1980.  The administrative and operational
organisation of the school was based on the model proposed in the working
document prepared for this component.
6.44   The purpose of the Regional Management Training Institute Project (Credit
1638-SE) (the Credit for which became effective in April 1986) is to help transform
ESGE into a regional body covering the needs of the West African Economic
Community, known as the African Centre of Higher Management Studies (CESAG).
The CESAG objectives are almost identical to those of ESGE which it absorbed.
ESGE activities, which CESAG is continuing while enlarging its area of
competence, were distributed mainly amongst three departments:
-     a department of higher management studies leading in two years to the
Higher Diploma in Management (DSGE Cycle) (see Annex 12);
-     a department of life-long education providing in-service training and
upgrading for executives by organising seminars, symposia and lectures;
and
-     a consultancy service responsible for conducting studies and research and
providing training in enterprises (see Annex 13).
1/    These draft decrees deal with the creation of an agricultural engineering
diploma, control of knowledge and skills, and abolition and replacement of
the organic decree of the INDR. Decrees dealing with the status of staff
are being prepared.



- 31 -
6.45   The long-cycle department (DSGE) has already had four sets of graduates
since the school was established. There are, on average, 48 persons in the two
years of studies of this cycle and, on average, 22 graduates per year (20 per cent of
whom are women). Since CESAG came into existence, entrants have increased to
36 and, when the school has reached planned enrolments levels, it will have 72
students and an annual outflow of about 33 graduates. Students have on average
four years of professional experience and some 10 per cent are recruited from the
private sector, S0 per cent from the public service and 40 per cent from the para-
statal sectorl/. In order to achieve its objectives and permit the maximum
flexibility in its operation, the school has a small permanent teaching staff of
eight, including four Senegalese and a large number (46) of teachers under
contract, mostly Senegalese. The technical assistance (ILO) used under the Third
Project amounted to 20 man/years and 7.5 man/months. It was found to be very
satisfactory and incidentally has been supplemented with bilateral assistance,
mainly Canadian. Three fellowship-holders received a total of eight man/years of
training abroad, but only one of them remained in CESAG, being promoted to be
head of the DSGE cycle department, while the others accepted attractive job
offers in the private sector. In addition, seven Senegalese teachers spent a month
training in Montreal (HEC) and other training sessions were arranged for teachers
under contract. In brief, this is a dynamic component whose achievements and
results are quite impressive and whose relevance to country needs and flexibility
are probably largely due to the size of the employer representation (some 50 per
cent of the seats) on the governing board.
6.46   The annual recurrent budget was about FCFA 22C million for the year
1984/8S and the budget estimate for 1985/86 is about FCFA 62S million, the
contribution of CEAO being over FCFA S77 million. The departments responsible
for in-service training and consultancies have substantial incomes and if the hopes
of the business consultancy department, which are partly based upon the
development of the regional service offered by the Centre, are realised, the School
will be on the way to a much greater degree of self-financing than at present.
6.47   CESAG has developed a rather ambitious four-year plan of action (1987-
1990) which will be supported by the IDA assisted project (Credit 1638-SE) and
from  UNDP.  This plan consists essentially of three sections, namely, the
development of (a) the potential of CESAG, (b) programme of activities of CESAG
and (c) CESAG relations with the CEAO countries. Efforts are therefore planned
to strengthen the teaching staff and obtain management tools for CESAG itself
with a view to installing a data processing system as well as a systematic internal
programme for training all the staff of the Centre; and to develop logistical
supports such as the library, the audio-visual service and the cassette library. New
training programmes will also be conducted such as the full-time management
training programme of variable duration (PFM), seminars in general management
and sectoral programmes of an average duration of two weeks. More realistic
planning will be possible for the activities of the consultancy department. Stress
will also be placed on the organisation of training programmes for trainers (priority
being given to teachers in the national institutions of management training and to
the specialised personnel of enterprises in the CEAO countries4 Amongst the
intentions expressed in the plan of action to develop CESAG relations with its
countries, strengthening the voice of the business sector in the decision-making
organs seemed to the mission to be an essential condition for future success.
1/    See Annex 14 for further parameters regarding these three departments.

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS
A.    CONCLUSIONS
General
7.01   Of the five components, all have partly achieved their objectives in varying
degrees. Civil works are stil! going on, in the vast majority of cases furniture and
equipment have been delivered and installed and the institut'  are operational.
However, all higher level instiwutions are operating at prohibit   er student costs
and all need to address this question urgently. The project has had a 16 per cent
cost underrun in US$ terms and a 32 per cent overrun in FCFA terms. The
implementation time overun, partly attributable to an expansion of project scope,
has been of the order of 97 per cent.
Primary Education and Educational Planning and Research
a)     Primary Education
7.02   This sub-component has partly achieved its objectives, and will receive
substantial assistance under the Primary Education Project (Credit 1735-SE) which
is aimed exclusively at developing elementary education.
b)    INEADE
7.03   Despite its failure to achieve all objectives, this project has laid an
important foundation. INEADE will also be given additional assistance under Credit
1735-SE. Certain research and studies already conducted by the Institute will be
valuable starting-points for future action, in the fields of research and experiment
- the preparation and adaptation of school programmes, the preparation and
introduction of continuing education and the preparation of teaching material - and
in the field of educational evaluation, especially If, as is the case at present, ENS
is involved in INEADE activities.
c)     Directorate of Educational Research and Planning (DRP)
7.04   On the whole, the Project objectives have been achieved for this sub-
component. DRP was strengthened. Nevertheless, further reinforcement Is needed
in regard to the school mapping, statistics, and policy work on the financing of
education, and for this reason Credit 1735-SE includes an important component to
support the DERPI/ (Directorate of Studies, Human Resources and Planning) which
will be created shortly to replace the DRP.
1/    Which is regarded in the framework of Credit 1735-SE as an essential tool
for helping to implement a global strategy for financing the
education/training sector without greatly increasing the pressure of this
sector on Government resources.

d)    Primary Teacher Training College (ENR) at Kolda - Laboratory School and
Ine ab2 rrimary M.assroom
7.05   This sub-component has achieved its objectives, since ENR now is on its
way to meeting its enrolment and output targets. Nevertheless, since enrolments
are at present insufficient and the student:teacher ratio is low, the institution is
still not operating economically. It is important that the ENR be used more
intensively to assist in directing the teacher training requirements of the country
In particular for in-service training of teachers and in conducting seminars for the
teachers of the New school. The laboratory school classrooms built in the teachers
training college and the 86 extra primary classrooms added to In the Project during
implementation will help to provide satisfactory accommodation for a large
proportion of the additional enrolments expected in the Kolda and Tambacounda
regions.
Technical Education
a)    Technical and Vocational Teachers Training Colleae (ENSETP)
7.06   Although it is difficult to assess needs in regard to various types of
technical teachers at different levels, the objectives for the ENSETP sub-
component have been achieved to a certain extent. However, the school is
functioning uneconomically in terms of the low studentnteacher ratio, low rate of
Senegalisation of staff and low enrolments. It has not succeeded in strengthening
its formal links with the ENSUT to which, nevertheless, it sends a good many of its
trainees during three years of their studies.
b)    Technical Secondary Schools
7.07   The Peytavin (St. Louis) and Delafosse (Dakar) technical secondary schools
will be able to achieve Project objectives by using the equipment and by
reorganisation in a functional manner. However, the curricula have not been
revised and are still similar to those used in France, the Senegalisation of the
teaching staff has not yet been accomplished, the operating costs are high, internal
efficiency needs improvement at certain levels, the student:teacher ratio is too
low and links between the schools and ENSETP seem to be minimal. The Peytavin
and Delafosse technical secondary schools need to establish a tracer system to
follow up their graduates. This would be a contribution to the study of the
appropriateness of the type of training provided in the light of the labour market
and the possibilities of access to higher education.
c)     National University School of Technology (ENSUT)
7.08   This sub-component is partly achieving Project objectives. The number of
teacher trainees from ENSETP which ENSUT receives every year is much lower
than the number originally planned and comprises only future secondary technical
teachers of industrial specialisations. ENSUT has a major challenge in regard to
securing its financial viability after cessation of the external aid furnished at
present by various countries.



- 35 -
Vocational trainin&: National Centre for Vocational Training (CNQP)
7.09   The Project aims have been achieved for this component. Pre-employment
training has grown, as well as the training advisory department, while the in-
service training and skills upgrading section is consolidating its previous positive
achievements. CNQP also needs to (a) extend its training to meet the needs of
other countries in the region, perhaps with fellowships being sought for foreign
students and (b) develop its self-financing activities.  It remains to organise
systematically the follow-up of trainees after they have left the Centre, as
recommended by the Completion Report for the Second Education Project.
7.10   The Project helped to create the National Vocational Training Organisation
(ONFP), which is destined to play an important role in the future ir. defining (in
close liaison with the vocational training directorate) the fields of responsibility of
the CNQP in vocational training in relation to other training schemes which might
be proposed in the private and para-statal sectors.
National Institute for Rural Development (INDR)
7.11   This Institute has not yet fully achieved the Project aims and at present is
operating very uneconomically in terms of the student:teacher ratio and of total
enrolments. The number of graduates is very small and the Senegalisation of the
teaching staff has not gone very far. INDR educational policy and objectives need
to be clarified and the level at which it recruits students needs to be reviewed,
along with the policy appointing students to public jobs at the start rather than at
the end of their training. Follow-up of the 1986 Saly Seminar recommendations
will be needed so that the necessary laws for revitalising the Institute will be
provided and the establishment of adequate arrangements in MEN will be made for
supervising agricultural education.
Management (ESGE/CESAG)
7.12   This institution  has achieved Project objectives and has generally
functioned satisfactorily so far. Its achievements so far are quite impressive in
terms of the amount and quality of the training made available, relations with the
industrial and business sector and the Senegalisation of the trairaing staff. A new
IDA Credit (Cr. 1638-SE) will finance additional buildings and equipment and
technical assistance to consolidate ESGE achievements and 'co convert it into a
sub-regional institution  with extended competence (CESAG).  Nevertheless
questions of high operating cost and low student:staff ratios remain to be resolved.
7.13   Part of the success of ESGE can be attributed to its favoured relations
with the industrial and business sector, which has been strongly represented on its
Governing Board. It is hoped that CESAG will continue these links. Closer links
are also needed between CESAG and other Project institutions, such as ENSUT and
CNQP, to their mutual benefit. CESAG can play the role of consultant and trainer
to ministries and the para-statal sector. Measures also need to be taken by those
responsible to ensure that those CESAG graduates whose careers are to be pursued
in the public sector shall, after their training, be received in a context that favours
the use of their newly-acquired skills.

General Observations
7.14   The implications of the national medium  and long-term  structural
adjustment programme (PAMLT 1985-1992), in particular, the more efficient
employment of existing resources, if applied to the project institutions would
suggest the need to improve the viability of these institutions as regards budget,
staff and the utilisation and maintenance of facilities. Advantage could also be
taken of the reforms introduced in the Ministry of Planning affecting the method
of project selection and the three-year planning of investments which the
Government has just adopted in the context of the Seventh Economic and Social
Development Plan (1985-1989). Here the role of DERP as an interlocutor of the
Ministry of Planning and an initiator in obtaining funds for the MEN is particularly
strengthened. This is something which the new procedures should permit.
7.15   It is not clear to what extent the economic and financial downturn since
the early 1980s may have influenced the Government in the direction of
discouraging full enrolment of the several project institutions for reasons of
recurrent cost or of labor market implications. However, as a means of rendering
these institutions more economical and useful to development at the same time, it
is clear (a) that the development needs of Senegal and other countries in the region
are such as to warrant fuller utilisation of the investments already made and (b)
that greater consideration could be given to (i) admission of students from other
countries; (ii) more rapid Senegalisation of staff; (iii) catering to the needs of the
private sector and (iv) participation by these institutions in in-service training.
B.    LESSONS
7.16   The experience gained during this Project enables certain lessons to be
drawn which are relevant to subsequent projects whether within Senegal or
elsewhere.
7.17   In the context of architectural innovation, the experience of the primary
schools in the Kolda district demonstrates (a) the importance of a detailed technical
study which would obviate the delays and additional work caused by alterations in
the course of construction and (b) the need for careful training and supervision of
workers in the new construction approaches.
7.18   The experience with Project accounting suggests the need for designing an
accounting system which makes it possible to know at any time the real situation of
the Project by category, component and source of financing and permits
comparison of achievements with appraisal targets or estimates.
7.19   As several projects have already demonstated, the problems involved in
procuring items of equipment for a component when there is no assurance that the
buildings in which they will be used have been designed to receive them, are costly.
7.20   Certain actions taken with respect to project management for Credit
1735-SE suggest learning from experience - the strengthening of the PIU in the
field of education and in coordinating the pedagogical and the technical assistance
aspects and the transfer of the PIU into the MEN. Nevertheless, the experience
shows the need for closer IDA monitoring of project accounts during supervisory
missions, including the adequate training of accountants.



- 37 -
7.21   Experience in this Project also confirms that at the conceptual stage of the
project, more thorough and realistic estimates are required in regard to the number
of students, student:teacher ratios and the measures needed to ensure economical
operation and sustainability of project institutions, including the maximising of the
opportunities for use of nationals of the country in staffing these institutions. In
the design of training of nationals, a careful assessment is required of the areas in
which local training would be advantageous and those in which training abroad on
fellowships is advantageous. The experience of the primary education research and
planning component also demonstrates the difficulties of including support for
education reform within a project when the key policy decisions within the country
have not as yet been finalised.
7.22   This project experience also confirms the need at the supervision and
implementation stage - especially in the case of complex projects involving several
components and spread out over several ministries - to ensure that the project
objectives and items and implementation requirements are well known to the
management and staff of the institutions intended to receive the benefits and to
participate in implementation.
7.23   Experience also reconfirms the need for I4A Supervisory missions to be
staffed with specialists needed to address the key problem areas. The project would
also have benefited from a thorough mid-term review.
