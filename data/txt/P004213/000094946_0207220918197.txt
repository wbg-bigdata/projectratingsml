3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.] Original Objective:
OveralL
This project provided grant funding to the Govemment of Malaysia (GoM) to meet its obligations under the
Montreal Protocol (MIP). The Bank is one of the executing agencies for the Multilateral Fund, which



functions as the fiunding mechanism to assist MP signatories in developing countries to achieve their
obligations.
The objectives" of the project were:
(i)    to assist the recipient in reducing Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) use and emissions
with available cost effective technologies, and
(ii)  to enhance the institutional capabilities of recipient agencies participating in ODS
recycling activities.
Malaysia ratified the Montreal Protocol (NP) on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer in November
1989, and became eligible to receive grants from the Ozone Trust Fund (OTF) in June 1990. Malaysia,
along with Mexico, China, Egypt and Nigeria were among the first countries to receive OTF grant finding
through the Bank. The project was not specifically included in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS),
however, MP operations were pioneering work for the Bank when it began investing in environmental
management in the early-90s. At the time of designing the project, knowledge and experience on ODS
consumption, altemative chemicals and technologies, and market behavior was very limited. The objectives
allowed sufficient flexibility for irnplementing the project, since the concept was fairly recent in 1992 and
implementing agencies - Department of the Environrnent (DoE) and Fire and Rescue Department (FRD) --
had no previous experience in ODS phase-out and Bank operations. This project catalyzed the
development of a follow-on investment project, which expanded the coverage of beneficiaries to phase-out
ODS.
1. as defined in the Grant Agreement
2. The objectives were also consistent with the Executive Committee of MLF for non-investment activities for the two
approved subprojects (MAC and Halon), which aimed to (i) initiate public awareness on the ODS phase out program, (ii) to
build institutional capacity of key agencies, and (iii) to gain better understanding on nature of investment needs in the sectors.
3.2 Revised Objective:
No revisions were made to the original objectives.
3.3 Original Components:
The Project consisted of two subprojects:
(i) Mobile Air Conditioning (MAC) and CFC Recycling (US$910,000)- MAC Sub-project: This
subproject had both technical assistance and investment components:
a) The technical assistance component included: (i) provision of expertise to DoE in the areas of
technical training and establishing computerized data bases; (ii) training of local trainers and MAC
technicians on the use of CFC recycling equipment; and (iii) preparation of public awareness
program on the benefits of CFC recycling and dissemination of information throug a series of
workshops and seminars.
b) The investment component was to finance about 200 sets of recycling and leak detection equipment
for distribution to selected service stations and for the training of technicians.
(ii) Halon Control, Recovery and Recycling (US$ 720.000) - Halon Sub-project. This subproject
comprised both technical assistance and investment components:
a) The technical assistance component included: (i) setting-up an inventory and registration system for
Halon 1211 and 1301; (ii) provision of engineering services to carry out demonstration of recover
and recycling activities; (iii) training of FRD officials on the use of Halon recycling units; (iv)
provision of expertise to strengthen FRD's implementation and monitoring capabilities; (v) setting-up
a laboratory; and

Links to objectives: Both sub-projects had clear links to project objectives. CFC 12 and Halon 1211 and
1301 are the more critical ozone depleting substances, and the focus of the project was to target their
reduction and replacement. Their baseline status as suggested in the Staff Appraisal Report is presented in
Box 1. Although consumption of Halons was not as high as CFCs, but they have a relatively high zone
depleting potential (ODP) compared to that of a CFCs (Halon 1301 has ODP=10, Halon 1211 has
ODP=3, CFCI I and CFC12 has ODP=I), therefore were given high priority. Further, both sub-projects
also assisted DoE and FRD to build their capacities and also increased public awareness.
Box 1: Assumptions on CFC 12
and Halons Use in 1990-91
CFC 12
*  Amount of CFC consumption in the MAC refrigeration which amounted to nearly 49% of the
total ODS consumption
*  Over a million motor vehicles (of the total of 5 million) were air conditioned
*  Normal service frequency was about 1-2 times per year (about 1.2 kg of CFC 12 charging size)
*  Presence of 5 large air conditioning compressors, 200 dealers, and more than 2,500 MAC service
shops
*  Project induced annual CFC12 reduction was estimated to be 250 tons
Halon 1211 and 1301
*  2,000 tons of Halon 1211 contained in 600-800,000 portable fire extinguishers
*   12-20,000 tons of Halon 1301 stockpiled
*  Estimated annual Halon 1211 emission was 200 tons
*  Project induced Halon 1211 reduction for the first year was estimated to be 140-200 tons
Capacity of Implementing Agency: Both DoE and FRD were logical choices to implement the project.
DoE is the principal agency responsible for implementing the National Environmental Quality Regulation
and also the focal point for MP, while FRD is primarily responsible for fire prevention and control
services, and regulates use of fire-extinguishers and fire-protection systems. However, both agencies had
no previous experience in ODS phase-out or managing Bank Operations, and therefore the project
assisted in their capacity building through training and technical assistance.
Implementation Period. The project was designed to achieve its objectives in two years, eventually it took
nine years. The implementation of the IvIAC Sub-project was completed in three years, while the Halon
Sub-project took 9 years, including a redesign during the implmentation phase. This was due to: (i) lack
of understanding of Bank procedures by the two clients; (ii) inadequate knowledge of ODS market and
technologies; (iii) over-estimation of client capacity to implement the project; and (iv) modification of
Halon Sub-project design.
-3-



3.4 Revised Components:
The Halon Sub-project was redesigned for the following reasons: (i) the original design would not have
enabled the govemment to meet its MP obligations; (ii) to create better incentives for private sector
participation; (iii) to maintain a more reliable database of Halon inventory; and (iv) to ensure complete
control of Halon 1211 and 1301 usage. Accordingly, this sub-project was re-designed, and the main
activities were:
*   Malaysia Halon Bank (MHB'): FRD invited and selected a private sector contractor to establish and
operate MHB and recycle Halon, including overseas training of local specialist;
*   Database on Halon Users: Maintaining a inventory of Halon users; and
*   Public awareness and training: Prepare and disseminate information on halon altematives and
training of officials from FRD, DoE and Custom Department.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
No quality at entry criteria existed when the project was approved. However, the assumptions used for
grant agreement endorsement, implementation period and client capacity were overly optimistic, and
rapid changes in technology and market behavior were not fully factored in the design of the project.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement ofobjective:
The overall achievement of the project objectives and outputs in terms of the sustainability and long-term
impacts was satisfactory. The project has put in place a policy and regulatory framework and delivery
mechanism to phaseout the use of CFC in MAC servicing sector and of Halons, through which the GoM
can now move towards achievement of its obligations under the Montreal Protocol. The noteworthy
features of the project were:
*   Framinp new leezislation: Based on experiences from the implementation of the project, GoM enacted
two new regulations to ensure the project's sustainability and impact of ODS phase-out. The two
regulations being: Environmental Quality (Refrigeration Management) Regulation, 1999 (control the
use of CEC as a refrigerant); and Environmental Quality (Halon Management) Regulation, 1999
(controlling the import, export, and use of Halons);
a   Institutional Capacity of DoE and FRD: DoE has been receiving assistance from MLF (through a MP
supported program under UNDP) to build its capacity to implement the ODS phaseout program in
the country. However, the project enabled DoE to further deepen its capacity to control the use of
CFC in MAC servicing sector and assist other agencies and the service shops by providing training
to staff and the necessary tools for planning, project management, and awareness raising. Whereas
for FRD, no capacity existed for ODS phase-out, and the project helped it to put in place the
organizational infrastructure needed to managed the phase-out of Halons.
e Shifting priority from recycle of halon 1211 to halon 1301 and pilotine the MHB: Given the different nature
of halon 1211 equipment (portable) and the fixed-nature of halon 1301 system, the GoM decided to
give high priority for investment to recycle halon 1301 and attempted to operate the MHB as a
private sector venture. However, this arrangement was tested for couple of years with a private sector
operator (Sukiada Engineering Sdn. Bhd. of Malaysia) and did not succeed due to lack of adequate
demand for recycled Halons in the country and the lack of specific regulation to control
-4-



Halons at the that time. After the Halon Management regulation was enacted and enfored in January
2000, GoM has assigned FRD to be responsible for management of MHB; and
* Scalingp-up Nation-wide: The experiences gained from the project enabled GoM to design a follow-on
project that targets the complete phase-out of CFC in the country. The scale-up project was approved
by ExCom in December 2001

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The project strenthened capacity at DoE and developed capacity at FRD. DoE staff were trained on the
application of R/R technique for management of CFC and Halons which is considered to be a cost-effective
option to reduce emission of CFC and minimize the impact of ODS phaseout to the country and key
stakeholders. The experience gained from the project would strengthen DoE capacity to implement the
- 5 -



Refrigeration Management Regulation and to meet the ODS phaseout obligation of the country. On halon
control, the project has built capacity of FRD to implement the Halon Management Regulation, especially
on monitoring and enforcement and the operation of MHB. FRD has institutionalized the Halon Unit and a
majority of the FRD enforcement officials were trained. This experience should be valuable to other
developing countries who are moving toward phasing out the use of halons. The project attempted to
promote private sector participation in the development and operation of the MHB, but without adequte
demand for recycled Halons in the country, private operation of MHB was not financially feasible. Private
operation of MHB may be possible after year 2010 when all the ODS has to be phased out from all
developing countries who have ratified the MP.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control ofgovernment or implementing agency:
The project was designed in 1991-92 at a time when there was limited capacity and experience in managing
ODS phaseout worldwide and there was no capacity or experience in Malaysia. Further, the two
implementing agencies were first time clients for the Bank. The technology changes and measures that
were being proposed were also new with little previous application. Therefore, both DoE and FRD
underwent a steep leaming curve. This largely contributed to the extended implementation period.
The project had an unrealistic time frame of two years when endorsed by the Executive Committee of
MLF. In retrospect, a project of this type should have been designed with a life of five years, to account for
Bank procedures and client familiarity with issues and procedures. However, such a recommendation at
the time of designing the project would have not been viewed favorably by MLF.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The project was launched in the absence of a legal framework, and this stalled the initial phase-out attempts
of CFC and Halon. However, as explained, towards the closing stages of the project, legislation for
refrigeration and halon management were enacted by GoM. Further, the lack of regulatory authority for the
privately-operated MHB and the lack of demand for recycled halons contributed to its non-performance,
which was eventually taken over by FRD.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The government commitment was strong throughout the project. However, getting cooperation from the
private sector and the general population require an extensive effort on public awareness and information
dissemination and on training of DoE and FRD offcials. The project enabled the country to prepare a
National CFC phase-out program whcih was approved by teh Executive Committee in December 2001.
However, competing local environmental priorities diverted the attention of senior management and staff of
the key agencies (DOE and FRD), which at times slowed down decision making on matters related to the
project.
5.4 Costs and financing:
The total costs of the project in US dollar terms remained the same (US$ 1.63 million). However, as
explained above there were implemenation and disbursement delays. The project was envisaged to be a
two-year operation, however, it took nearly nine years to fully disburse and achieve the objectives of the
project, and it was extended six times. The reasons being: (i) unrealistic estimation of the implementation
period, (ii) inadequate knowledge of the recipient agencies in ODS phase-out and Bank procedures, (iii)
changes in technology and market conditions and (iv) modifications to implementation arrangements for the
Halon Sub-project, which took a longer period to implement than the MAC Sub-project (nearly 4 years).
The implementation of the Halon Sub-project was delayed primarily due to the time it took to hire the
- 6 -



private operator (Sukiada Engineering SDN BHD. Malaysia) for the MIB and thereafter the inability of
the operator to be able to implement the recycling program in the absence of regulatory authority. The
situation changed after the government enacted the Halon Managemnet Regulation in 2000 and FRD took
over the management of MI-HB. This also necessitated a reallocation of unutilized funds to new
disbursement categories -- civil works and incremental operating costs.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Rationale
The government enacted two regulations: Refrigeration Management Regulation and Halon Management
Regulation; institutionalized the Halon Unit in FRD; trained FRD officials; and established the MHB,
especially the database for halon users. These actions should ensure the sustainability of the assistance
provided by the project and the GoM efforts to control the use of CFC as a refrigerant and of halons as a
fire extinguishing substance. The government remains on course to meet its MP obligations.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Sustainability beyond the life of this project is assessed in terms of likeliness of meeting ODS phase out
targets in 2005, 2007, and 2010, with minimum impact on the ODS users.
Subprojects
MAC Subproject
For MAC servicing sector, under the recently approved National CFC Phase-out Project (NCFCP), it is
expected that by the end of 2009, the service shops, the vehicles owners, and other relevant parties will be
ready to comply with the MP obligation and adequate recycled CFC would be available for servicing those
who need them. DOE by that time can fully integrate the monitoring and enforcement of CFC into their
routine operations and ensure sustainability of the CFC control in this sector.
Halon Subproject
Similar to Halon sector, although not intended at the beginning, the MHB has been established and now
being operated. FRD who is the key regulator for fire protection is fully committed to maintain the
operation of the MHB, at least to meet the demands of the essential users. If appropriate, in the future,
operation of the MHB may be contracted to the private sector, if market conditions improve.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The preparation was satisfactory. The project enabled the Bank to establish a dialogue with the
two Departments, who were responsible for drafting the inital proposal for the project. The Bank
assembled a strong technical team which had a very sound working relation with both DoE and FRD. The
preparation time for the project was between 6 and 9 months. Bank procedures had to be adjusted to
accomodate this project, which was an OTF grant and not a regular loan or credit instrument.
7.2 Supervision:
The successive Bank task teams have had a sound and constructive working relationship with the
implementing agencies - DoE and FRD. The Bank's performance in providing implementation support was
satisfactory despite the task manager being changed four times during the project life. The Bank undertook
regular supervision missions to review progress and performance, financial management and procurement
review, and also responded to letters of government regularly. The relocation of the task management to
-7 -



the Bankgkok Office, further improved communication and implementation support for the project. The
task team was adequately staffed, and provide useful guidance on technical issues and project management
to DoE and FRD, and at times to the beneficiaries.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The overall performance was satisfactory. The Bank, country, and MLF priorities were well
addressed to implement MP obligations. Intensive Bank support at the initial stages of the project would
have expedited the implementation of the project.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
At the time of project preparation , DoE was seriously understaffed and therefore required outside expertise
to prepare the project. Whereas FRD was a well managed public organization with a large responsibility to
prevent and radicate fire incident and provide rescue service for the whole country. However, both had very
limited technical capacity on ODS phase-out. DoE in coordination with FRD and assisatnce from
intemational and local experts drafted the initial proposal for the project. This formed the basis for the
final project design. The final project design and grant agreement was thoroughly reviewed by the DoE and
the Economic Planning Unit in the Prime Minister's Office. The client performance was found to be
satisfactor.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The performance of the two recipient agencies, DoE and FRD, progressively improved, and today both
play a prominent role in assisting GoM to achieve its MP obligations. DoE took the lead for the MAC
sub-project and assist FRD in the implementation of the Halon Sub-project. Both agencies worked in
tandem and the coordination between them was satisfactory. DoE also satisfactorily administered the
Project account.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
DOE: DOE perforrmance during the preparation phase was satisfactory despite staff shortcomings.
However, during the implementation, DOE was the key driving force for the overall achievement of the
MAC subproject. DOE also contributed significantly to the achievement of the halon subproject. DOE
were also responsible for administration of the Project's fund and bookkeeping of all the records and
accounts.
For MAC subproject, most of the activities were carried out as planned, but delays occurred mainly due to
the lack of experience on Bank's procurement and disbursement procedures. A number of publications,
unscheduled visits, and retraining of the operators were carried out by DOE even after the completion of
the MAC subproject. DoE also enacted the legal framework for ODS phase-out through the Halon
Management Regulation and Refrigeration Management Regulation.
FRD. FRD performance during the preparation phase was satisfactory despite staff shortcomings. FRD
attempted to innovate the implementation arrangement for the Halon Sub-project by involving the private
sector to operate the MHB. When it was recognized that this experiment will not succeed, FRD made
arrangements to take charge of MHB, which is working properly today.
Procurement and management of Special Account was less than satisfactory, however, this improved with
time as both agencies began requiring their staff to be trained in Bank requirments

8. Lessons Learned
a. Optimistic implementation period.
As mentioned previously, the two year time frame to implement the project was inadequate. This time
frame had been based on the urgency of meeting MP obligations, and did not fully capture the capabilities
of DoE and FRD to implement a project of this nature. Further, both agencies were hampered lack of
knowledge and experience in Bank procedures. This caused considerable delays in completing project
documentation including grant agreement and its subsequent extensions, procurement and special account
management.
For the preparation of NCFCP, efforts have been made to (i) incorporate Bank requirements at an early
stage, and (ii) provide training to implementing agencies on Bank procurement and disbursement policy.
However, there are time constraints on the phase-out targets and only resolution is to speed up Bank's
processing procedures as much as possible. In addition, Bank's procedures for OTF assistance should be
reviewed to ensure simpler processing of such operations.
b. Need for regulatory authority and public awareness
Regulartory Authority
Regulatory authority is an important factor for supporting incentives for ODS phase-out activities. In the
case of MAC subproject, without a proper regulatory framework and effective enforcement, the efforts to
provide financial incentives, training, and other assistance had been found inadequate to induce investment
in non-CFC technologies. Similarly, Halon subproject did not proceed well under the management of the
private operator who lacked regulatory authority. The government quickly learned this, and enacted
separate legislation for refrigeration and halon management.
This lesson was considered and incorporated in the preparation of NCFCP. For MAC servicing sector,
mandatory car inspection will include CFC check up and extensive training for land transport regulators.
Basic equipment is also provided to the regulators ( the Road Management Department , DOE, Custom,
etc.)
Public Awareness
Without public awareness, promulgation of regulations would be difficult. Public awareness component of
MAC subproject had helped to minimize resistance to the enactment of Refrigeration Management
Regulation.
c. Training and Financial Subsidy
In MAC subproject, market demand for recycled CFC was driven by the willingness to pay of car owners.
In addition to the lack of regulation (as discussed above), and limited financial and technical capacity were
contributing factors for service shops not to invest in recycling machines. Low price of CFC and its
relatively simple technology encouraged recoversion back to CFC (RI 34a) especially for old cars and taxis.
Without adequate trainng and appropriate financial subsidy, the service shops would have difficulties with
financing and handling non-CFC technology.
Training and financial subsidy were incorporated in the preparation of NCFCP. Financial subsidies for
recycling machines would be provided.

Since there is a separate reporting system for ODS projects to the Secretariat of the Multilateral Fund for
the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol, it was not required that supervision reports be filled out, until
very recently. That is why it is difficult to find historic Bank input in the Bank informnation system.
Between 1996-2001, the Task Team undertook 3 supervision missions annually. Task Team Leader and
another Environmental Specialist participated in all three missions, while the Financial Management and
Procument Specialist joined the third mission.
