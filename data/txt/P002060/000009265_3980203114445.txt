FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
BORNO STATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower         : Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN)
Beneficiary      : Borao State Water Board (BSWB)
Amount           : US$72.0 million equivalent
Terms            : Payable over 20 years, including 5 years of grace at the
standard variable interest rate.
Relending          The Federal Government would onlend the full amount of
Terms          : the loan to the Borno State Government (BSG), which in
turn would relend US$57.6 million to the Borno Statea Water
Board (BSWB) on the same terms and conditions as the Bank
loan.  The remaining US$14.4 million would be given to BSWB
by BSG as equity contribution. BSG would carry the
foreigr. exchange risk on the entire loan amount.
Project            The project would expand the water supply service in the
Desecription   : Borno State capital, Maiduguri, to include some 74,000 people who
ate presently not served by BSWP and to meet the demand of
the projected population of 543,000 by 1992. The project
would improve the quality of service and assist in
strengthening BSWB both financially and institutionally,
through the pro'rision of technical assistance. The
project includr.s (a) a plant for the treatment of raw
water from the Alau dam and reservoir; (b) pumping and
storage facilities; (c) transmission masins and an improved
distribution system; (d) headquarters building and
workshops; (e) generators, drilling rigs and vehicles;
(f) technical assistance for financial management and
accounting, project implementation and plant operation,
manajxement improvement and training; and (g) studies of
s!titation in Maiduguri and tariffs for the State.
A special account would be established with part
of the pToceeds of the loan. The amounts advanced into
this account would be used to prefinance reimbursable local
costs and small foreign expenditures.
The principal benefit of the project would be to make safe
drinking water avai.able and to improve the quality of
service to the population of Naiduguri. Project risks
could arise from delays in securing the source of water,
inadequate and tardy counterpart funding, and BSWB's
inexperience in the operation of the proposed plant.
Construction work for the Alau dam is well underway.
Assurances have been obtained from FGN that funding for the
completion of the dam would be provided.



- vi -
In order to ensure timely counterpart funding, establishment
of a project account and a schedule of BSG payments into it
have been agreed at negotiations. Technical assistance would
be provided to facilitate smooth plant operation in the early
years and to train BSWB staff for eventual takeover of
operational responsibilities.

1/ This is the minimum ERR with expected incremental revenues to BSWB as a
result of the project taken as a proxy for project benefits. This
understates the true benefits, however, as other benefits (such as
consumers' surplus) have not been quantified, and externil ities (such
as improved health conditions) are not included.



PEDERAL REPUBLIC OP NIGERIA
BORNO STATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
I. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR
A. Background
1.01     Located between latitudes 4ON and 1311 and having a land area of
approximately 923,000 km2, Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa with
some 94 million inhabitants. The last official census was in 1963 when the
population was 56 million and present estimates are extrapolations from this
figure. There are 19 states constituting the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
Borno State, at the northeastern corner of the country is, in area, the
largest of the states, covering 112,000 km2. It has a population of slightly
under 5 million and is growing at an estimated rate of 3.0X per annum compared
with an annual national population growth rate of 2.5% 1/ . Some 0.9 million
of the population reside in the 21 urban towns of which the largest is
Maiduguri, the State capital, which has an estimated population of about
0.3 million.
1.02     Borno State's terrain is flat.  Its climate is semi-arid and it has
sparse vegetation. There are only a few rivers and these dry up during the
dry season. The mean minimum daily temperature is about 190C and the mean
daily maximum is over 34°C. There are well-defined dry and wet seasons, the
latter spanning the period April to September with peak rainfall occurring
during July and August. Average precipitation is of the order of 500 mm per
year. The State's economy is based primarily on agriculture.
B. Water Resources and Control
1.03     Lake Chad is the only notable source of naturally occurring,
permanent surface water in the State. All the other surface water sources are
not perennial and hence not a dependable source of year-round water supply
1/   Western Africa Region, Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Strategy Paper,
August 1982 by WAPWS (Project File Al.).

without adequate storage. Fortunately much of the State, some 70X of its
area, is underlain by aquifers, mostly artesian. These serve as the source
for year round supplies of water and are supplemented with surface water
during the wet season. Despite the almtost total dependence on these aquifers,
their extent and safe yields are not fully established which accounts for the
present overabstraction. The water level in the Maiduguri area has been
estimated to have dropped mnre than 7 m in the last five years 2/ . Depletion
at the present rate. of abstraction coupled with the anticipated increased
demands on the system in the future clearly point to the need for an
alternative source to supplement groundwater 3/ . Recognizing this need, an
understanding has been reached between the Borno State Water Board (BSWB) and
the Chad Basin Development Authority (CBDA) to share the waters of a
reservoir (Lake Alau reservoir), now under construction, equally for water
supply and irrigation purposes at times of average or better rainfall but to
give rriority to wiater supply in drought years (Annex 1). The execution of a
legally binding agreement between CBDA and BSWB, satisfactory to the Bank, and
including provisions to meet the requirements of BSWB at all times, is a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
1.04     The Borno State Government (BSG) has, through the Federal Government
of Nigeria (FGN), requested Bank assistance to finance a treatment facility
and ancillary works for the purification of watex for Maiduguri from the
proposed Lake Alau dam and reservoir located some 15 km from Maiduguri on the
River Ngadda and to improve service in other areas of the State. The dam and
reservoir estimated at a cost of N16 million is being constructed with FGN
funds and would be operated and maintained by CBDA, a federal organization.
Constructioa started in F..abruary 1984, and is scheduled to be completed at the
end of June 1986. Assurances have been received from FGN that the necessary
2unds will be made available so construction can proceed as scheduled.
C. Sector Organization
1.05     The BSWB, a parastatal organization which reports to the Secretary to
the Military Governor, is mainly responsible for the development, operation,
distribution and maintenance of drinking water supplies in the State. It also
has recently taken over responsibility for the provision of animal watering
points from the Veterinary Department.
1.06     The CBDA is the only other organization involved in the water supply
sector in Borno State. It is one of 18 such Federal River Basin Authorities
in Nigeria and is responsible for the integrated development of the water
resources of the Chad River Basin area including the sources for the supply of
raw water for domestic uses and for irrigation. It is involved in the
installation of rural water points under a Federal Government sponsored

borehole drilling program. As the responsible agency for the Lake Alau dam
and reservoir, the source of future raw water for Maiduguri, CBDA would have a
more important role to play in the sector development.
1.07     Sanitation, drainage and refuse collection are constitutionally the
responsibility of local authorities. In practices development funds chan-
nelled through the Ministry of Local Government are utilized by the State
Ministry of Works acting as agent for Local Governments in the implementation
of drainage projects. This arrangement has not been satisfactory and BSG is
reviewing the whole question of institutional responsibility for this sub-
sector. The Ministry of Health is responsible, together with its health
units, for water quality monitoring. Linkages between sector organizations
are weak and ill-defined and, as a result, there is little coordination of
programs.
D. Levels of Service
1.   Water Supp12
1.08     There are presently two levels of service, house or compound
connection and public standpipes. For Borno State as a whole, it was
estimated that by 1980 there were about 20,000 house connections and some 700
public standpipes in the nine largest towns, including Maiduguri, with a
combined population of 670,000 4/ . These facilities were estimated to provide
water services to about 43% of the total population in these towns.
1.09     The segment of the population in Maiduguri supplied with BSWB
produced water is believed to be close to 100% since there is only a very
snall number of private wells for domestic use, and surface water sources are
not available in the long dry season. As of end 1982. there were 20,000 house
connections serving about 38% of the population (122,000 people) and 254
standpipes, providing water for an estimated 127,000 people or 39% of the
population. The rest (23%) of the population obtained water from vendors who
obtained their water from the BSWB system, from neighbors who have private
house connections, and from BSWB tankers.  The water is very warm (55°C) and
does riot undergo any treatment prior to distribution. The average per capita
daily consumption is about 60 lcd. It is expected that by 1993, the end of
the disbursement period of the proposed loan, service by house connection
would be extended to more than 50% of the population in Maiduguri.
2. Sanitation
1.10     There are no waterborne sewerage systems in the State, and sanita-
tion, where practiced, is provided privately by on-plot facilities. Refuse
collection services are inadequate and, as a result, large quantities of solid
wastes litter urban streets and clog the few available drains constituting an
4/   Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Planning Document, December 198fl by
WHO/IBRD-CP (Project File A-3).



-4-
aesthetic nuisance and public health hazard. Drainage services are also, in
general, inadequate largely because Local Governments, as responsible
agencies, do not have the technical resources to design, implement and
maintain projects themselves and have become dependent on the limited
resources of the State Ministry of Works (para 1.07).
E. Planned Investments in Water Supply and Sanitation
1.11     Borno State Government's investment program for the sector is
contained in the State's Fourth Development Plan (1981-1985). Under the Plan,
the Ste proposes to extend water supply services in Maiduguri by using water
from the Lake Alau reservoir. Water supply service would also be extended to
about 40 towns and provincial centers and to a large number of rural areas by
providing about 1,000 boreholes and wells and 100 artificial ponds. The total
plan provision for this program is N198.1 million, about 12% of the State's
planned Development Budget of N1,714.1 million. Although these targets, in
view of the State's financial constraints, are now unrealistic, they indicate
that iater supply and agriculture are the State's priority sectors.
1.12     Investment plans for the sanitation subsector during the period 1981-
1985 provide for the constructicn of drains in Maiduguri and some other towns
and a grant to local authorities to assist in the collection and disposal of
refuse; provision of public conveniences and vehicles and othier appurtenances
for a total cost of approximately N30.3 million. There is no provision for
sewerage and clearly, waterborne sewerage is not the most appropriate
alternative for wastewater disposal in Maiduguri at this time.
F. Sector Objectives
1.13     Provision of safe water supplies to both urban and rural areas in
adequate quantities has long been an important social goal in Nigeria at both
the Federal and State levels. Unfortunately. the resources allocated and
actually made available to the sector have not always reflected the priority
and importance accorded to it. Low level and intermittent release of State
funds which are largely consumed for recurrent expenditures due to inadequate
tariffs, and shortage of trained and experienced staff, make improving the
standard, levels and coverage of service a daunting task in the medium term.
Objectives of the sanitation subsector are limited to the provision of public
conveniences and improving drainage which acts as a surrogate for sewerage by
provision of few outfall drains. There is a need for more comprehensive
planning if sector objectives are to be achieved 5/ .
1.14     BSG identifies with the objectives of the International Drinking
Water Supply and Sanitation Decade, but neither programs have been launched
nor ftnda earmarked specifically for the attainment of these objectives in
Borno State. To make meaningful progress towards meeting decade objectives
5/ Nigeria Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Memorandum (in Grey Cover),
October 1984, by WAPWS. (Project Files A4.).



i - 5 -
would require that the above identified sector deficiencies (para 1.13) be
addressed. This is one of the major objectives of this project.
G. Role of Bank
1.15     The Bank's overall goal is to help BSWB to provide a more reliable
service while becoming financially viable. To achieve this end, better
planning is required for investments in the sector: pricing policies must be
implemented to permit BSWB to recover costs, meet debt service and provide a
reasonable contribution to future investments. BSWB must be strengthened so
it may properly operate and maintain physical and financial systems in
addition to achieving the planning and financial objectives.
1.16     The proposed project would represent the Bank's first participation
in the urban water supply subsector in Borno State, although it is involved in
the State's rural water supply subsector through the on-going Agricultural
Development Project. It is, however, the third Bank project in the sector in
Nigeria following projects in Kaduna and Anambra States.  As in the first two
projects, the predominant sector issues remain institution development,
financial viability of sector institutions, training of Nigerian staff and
policy reforms required to facilitate addressing these issues. Borno State
officials have emphasized their strong commitment to this project and have
demonstrated a willingness to work with the Bank by having accepted and
instituted, at the Bank's suggestion, tariff reforms.  While the Federal
Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Rural Development (FMAWR) is, in
theory, the single supervising Ministry for the water supply sector at the
Federal Government level it has no substantial influence on sector investments
or policies at the State levels. While the complex issue of defining the
proper role of the FMAWR in the national context is being dealt with, in
parallel to this proposed loan, through intensive sector work and dialogue
with the Federal Government, the current set-up, which delegates the
responsibility for the water supply/sanitation sector to the States makes it
necessary for the Bank to deal with a number of state authorities if it is to
assist effectively in sound sector development. The priority of the sector
(para 1.11), the strong commitment to it by Borno State officials, and its
benefits to the urban poverty population make this project worthy of
consideration for Bank financing.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
A. Location
2.01     The project area is Maiduguri, the capital city of Borno State.  It
is also the area where the groundwater level has declined the most and is
judgeid inadequate by hydrogeological evaluations to meet anticipated future
needs. The topography of the city is flat with the Bama Ridge, which rises
some 10 m above the surrounding plain, representing the highest terrain. The
River Ngadda, the potential source of future water supply for the city, runs
along the southwestern side of the ridge. The high density low Income area of



-6-
Central Maiduguri has very inadequate urban services, particularly water
supply and sanitation.
B. Population
2.02     A 1973 survey reported the population of Maiduguri at 167,500
representing an average annual growth rate of 6.7% from the 1963 census figure
of 88,000. The 1980 population (285,000) was derived by an iterative process
that applied an average rate of growth to the 1973 population and then checked
the projected figure for consistency against the populations implied by school
enrollments, taxpayers' records, water consumption and aerial photographs of
the town. Population projections for the post 1980 period were determined by
fitting alternative regresslon models to the population data for 1963) 1973
and 1980 and are aB follows:
Population ProJections
(Thousands of People)
Year                       1980         1985         1990        1995         2000
Population (000's)          285          391          498         621          756
Annual Growth Rate (%)           6.5          5.0          4.5          4.0
Migration restrictions and a slow-down in economic activity in Nigeria are
anticipated to result in a decreasing growth rate as shown above. The design
population for Maiduguri for 1992, the estimated final year of project
horizon, is 543,000.
C. Residential Patterns
2.03     Except for the Government Residential Area (G,RA) and the recently
established low-income housing sites, residential areas in Central Maiduguri
and the older parts of the city are mixed with regard to the quality of the
structure and the relative opulence of the occupants. Population densities in
these areas are high (275 persons per hectare) and infrastructure services are
usually inadequate. Settlement since 1977 indicates a slight shift away from
"old" Maiduguri and towards the less dense and less traditional areas of the
town but residential patterns remain mixed.
2.04     Water needs for various categories of consumers are estimated on the
basis of service type, that is, single tap, multiple tap or the affluent GRA
equivalent. Water consumption is thus mostly governed by the type of water
service utilized by a household, rather than the area of residence.
D. Existing Facilities
2.05     BSWB water in the ?4aiduguri area is supplied solely from groundwater
sources within Maiduguri. The existing supply facilities consist of 69
boreholes scattered throughout the city. Twenty-eight of the boreholes tap
the lower aquifer at depths of 500 - 600 m; the middle aquifer at a depth of



150 - 350 m is tapped by 4 boreholes and the remaining 37 boreholes are in the
upper aquifer at a depth of up to 150 m. Daily average water abstraction from
these aquifers is slightly more than 40,000 m3 with at least 60X of it being
abstracted from the lower aquifer. The characteristics of samples of water
from the lower aquifer are shown in Annex 2-1.  The water is of good drinking
quality. The occasional bacteriological contamination of this water has been
attributed to persistent low pressures caused by frequent power failure and
leaks in the distribution system. Provision of generators and a program to
rehabilitate the distribution system as necessary would help alleviate the
above problems. Systematic examination of piped water supplies in Maiduguri
is not made.
2.06     The capacity of the existing storage reservoir is 4,500 m3 equivalent
to slightly more than two hours of supply at the average day flow. A minimum
of four hours is usually required for operational flexibility and hence the
present under-capacity imposes constraints on efficient operation of the
distribution system which consists of 261 km of pipes of various materials and
ranging in size from 50 mm to 400 mm. The age and condition of the pipes are
unknown but the general standard of maintenance is poor.
2.07     Unaccounted-for water is estimated to be in the order of 50% based on
BSWB's estimates of water production and average water usage of the various
categories of consumers. Rehabilitation of the distribution system, extension
and reinforcement of the recently initiated program to disconnect illegal
connections and preventive maintenance measures are included in this project
and are expected to reduce unaccounted-for water to about 302 over the project
period.
E. Categories of Service
2.08     The categories of service and the estimated average daily consumption
per category using 6.1 persons per household are as follows:
Categories of Domestic Service and Consumption Levels in Project Area (1982)
Average
Service              Estimated            Percent of total        Consumption

a/ Number of persons per standpipe assumed to be 500.
b/ Service through vendors, neighbors, BSWB water tankers.



2.09     In 1982 there were 20,000 registered domestic connections in
Maiduguri serving an estimated 122,000 personsU or about 38X of the total
population of 323,000. Some 108,000 of these were served through single tap,
compound or yard connections.  Service to the population tot served by house
connections was by means of public standpipes, of which there were 254. The
1982 standard of domestic service defined as the ratio of the population
obtaining service through private connections to the population served by
public standposts and other means (para 1.09) was 38:62. It is BSWB's
objective to maximize the number of house connections within the constraints
of water availability and costs and to improve the quality and reliability of
service. BSWB intends to drop the connection fee from N190 to N15 to
stimulate requests for connections and to make the service more affordable to
the urban poor. The difference in the connection fee is expected to be
recovered through increased revenue from connected customers. By 1992, BSWE
plans to achieve a service mix of 54:46. This would require more than doubling
the number of connections from 20,000 in 1982 to over 48,000 in 1992.  Only
few connections are metered at present but BSWB has adopted metering as the
most equitable way to charge for water consumption and has embarked on a meter
installation program. It has also amended the existing flat rate tariff
schedule to include metered consumption 6/ . The salient aspects of the new
tariffs are presented in Chapter V. M4etering started with the commercial,
industrial and large private consumers and would eventually appLy to all
connections.  Lack of sufficient connectors is impeding the meter installation
program. The project is making US$1.0 million, two payments of US$0.5 million
each, available through the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) to BSWB. The
first tranche is to be used as part payment to the consulting engineers who
are doing the detailed engineering design and to the financial controller
whose services are required in advance of loan effectiveness. The second
would be used to fund technical assistance as well as connectors so metering
can proceed on target and anticipated revenues realized. The first PPF
-request was initiated before appraisal and was therefore limited to
US$500,000.
2.10     The 254 standpipes could realistically provide "access to service"
for 127,000 persons, using the commonly accepted criterion of one standpipe to
a maximum of 500 persons. In reality, the situation is much worse because as
a result of lack of maintenance, only a fraction of the standpipes is in good
working condition and population growth is outstripping the pace at which
service is being provided.

F.  Future Water Production Requirements
2.11     Projections of future water consumption in Maiduguri and the pro-
duction required to meet i, are presented in Annex 2-2 and summarized below:
Demand Projections for Project Area
1982    1985    1988    1992
Population of Maiduguri (000's)               323.0   391.0   452.0   543.0
Number of persons connected (000's)           122.0   160.0   208.0   293.0
Average daily production (000 m3)              40.4    44.4    50.5    62.6
Average daily total consumption (000 m3)       20.2    24.9    32.9    43.8
Consumption as part of production (z)          50.0    56.0    65.0    70.0
Average Daily connected population
consumption (000 m3)                         12.0    15.2    21.4    30.8
Average per capita daily consumption (lcd)   98.0    95.0   103.0   105.0
(Connected population)
Number of connections (000's)                  20.0    26.2    34.1    48.0
Connection rate (%)                            38.0    41.0    46.0    54.0
2.12     In making these projections, groundwater production in 1984 is set at
44,000 m3 per day, the estimated maximum yield based on hydrogeological
evaluations.  This necessitates a decrease in per capita consumption due to
population growth in the intervening years until 1989, when treated surface
water becomes available. M!etering and the institution of a progressive tariff
structure coupled with more aggressive billing and collection are intended to
encourage conservation and to hold down consumption by the connected
population, even as more water becomes available in the future to about the
present level of around 100 lcd which, based on experience in other West
African cities, is adequate.
III. THE PROJECT ENTITY
A. Background
3.01     The beneficiary of the loan would be the Borno State Vater Board
(BSWB), the agency entrusted with statewide responsibility for water supply.
BSWB was proclaimed by Edict No. 7 of 1977 7/ as a division of the Borno
State Ministry of Natural Resources. In October 1979, it assumed parastatal
status, in February 1980 became a self-accounting agency, atd now reports to
the Secretary to the Military Governor of the State.
7/   Borno State Water Board Edict 1977 (Project File A6.).



- 10 -
3.02     The major responsibilities of BSWB under Edict No. 7 include the
development, provision and distribution of water in Borno State for public,
agricultural, trade and industrial purposes,  BSWB is empowered and obliged to
charge consumers for its services at prices, subject to approval by the
Governor, to ensure that revenue in each year is sufficient to meet
operational expenses, interest on and repayment of borrowings, and creation of
a ger,eral reserve for extensions. BSWB has authority to borrow money and to
procure goods and services up to a ceiling of N500,000 beyond which all
contracts must be appToved by BSG.  Although It has made noticeable progress
recently in billing and collection, financial discipline is still Largely
foreign to BSWB.
B. Orgaizat:ion and MIanagement
3.03     Edict No. 7 stipulates that BSWB's policies are made, and its
operations controlled, by a Board of directors which is to include
representatives from different State Ministries, LocaL Governments and private
citizens together with the General Manager. The Chairman of the Board and all
members are to be appointed by the Governor.  Functionally, ESWB is run by an
executive General Manager and is assisted by a management team comprising
department beads and the Board's secretary. BS1B, whose organizational
structure is shown in Annex 3-1, has eight operational departments located
within its headquarters in Maiduguri and seven area offices under the control
of area managers none rf whom are professionally qualified.  The organization
structure is acceptable and would function satisfactorily if it could be
filled with qualified and capable staff on the level of middle management. To
deal with the general shortage of middle management s;aff, BSWB has adopted a
very centralized style of management. The result of tr.is i9 that management
is involved in the pettiest administrative matters.  Tlis psoblem would be
addressed by the project's technical assistance and training provisions.
C. Personnel
3.04     As of FebruaTy 1981 BSWB employed 586 permanent staff and 258
temporary staff. Of the permanent staff 242 were headquarters staff, 110 were
for the Eaidugurl area office, 109 for the other area offices and 125 were for
rural water supply. In 1982, in addition to new recruitment, most of the
temporary staff were converted to permanent status bringing the total
permanent staff strength to 1,060 by December 1982. Only a few of the staff
have the necessary qualifications and training needed to undertake the tasks
for which they are employed. BSWB is seriousLy deficient in higher technical
and middle management staff and finds difficulty in recruiting and retaining
q-:alified personnel in the face of the higher remuneration and more flexible
conditions of appointment in the private sector.  Many professional and
management positions remain unfilled.  The majority of the professional staff
are expatriates under contract. Their complete replacement by nationals is
not expected in the near future.
3.05     The inadequacy of staffing, difficulties in staff recruitment and the
constraints of the existing management structure, as well as deficiencies in
the present operation and financial sections were discussed with BSWB and
their consultants during project preparation and at appraisal and an under-



- 11 -
standing was reached regarding the need for technical assistance.  The techni-
cal assistance and training to be included in the project are considered
necessary to ensure that BSWB would have the capacity to execute the ptoject
and to train more Nigerians to take over more and higher positions of
responsibility at BSWB and, in the medium term, replace the expatriates. The
possibility of providing the technical assistance team through a "technical
co-operation" arrangement with a well-run water utility is being explored.
D. Training
3.06     BSWB has established a school for the in-service training of
Assistant Works Superintendents (AWS). Apart from this no other systenaatic
training is provided. The AWS school has good accommodations and is well
located cLose to the main workshop complex. The AWS program is in great
demand by other state water agencies which usually fill the majority of the 70
course places available. With a total complement of about 1,060 staff of
whom only 40 are in the works superintendent grades there is a need to
expand BSWB's training program to address a broader range of administrative
and technical training requirements.  The school is managed by an expatriate
principal supported by a smalL administrative staff. Expansion of the
training program will require to be supported by the development of a cadre
of trained training staff.
3.07     The training program proposed under the project is presented in
detail in Annex 3-2.  The program would have two main thrusts. The first would
be to develop the AWS school to become a training department, staffed and
equipped to provide priority training programs covering basic and refresher
training in plant and pipeline maintenance, meter reading, commercial
management and basic bookkeeping. The limited regional training service
currently provided by BSWB would continue.  The second thrust of the training
component would be to establish a senior staff localization progran
incorporating programs and resources within and external to Nigeria which, in
the longer term, would reduce BSWB)s dependence upon expatriates at management
and senior technical levels. This program would include 15 man-years of
external training for BSWB staff through attachment to European and/or other
utilities and training institutions and would emphasize the development of
operational skills and experience in progressive and well-managed water
utilities. The total cost of the program is estimated to be N1,152,000 of
which N865,000 would be in foreign exchange to be financed under the proposed
loan.
3.08     The program was discussed and agreed in principle with BSWB in the
course of appraisal.  During negotiations assurance was obtained that BSWB
will appoint training consultants acceptable to the Bank and a Nigerian
Training M1anager to succeed the current expatriate AWS school principal when
his present contract expires. Draft termis of reference for the consulting
services, which will be prepared with Bank assistance, will include the design
of mechanisms to (i) minimize the potential loss of staff trained under the
project, and (ii) continuously administer, coordinate and monitor the
substantial program of external training att:achments and study tours to be
financed by the training component.



- 12 -
E. Operation and Maintenance
3.09     BSWB's operations have expanded significantly in all phases of water
supply since its inception in 1977. Since 1982, lack of funds for spare parts
and vehicles has become more prevalent and has prevented BSVB from satisfac-
tory performance in its operations. BSWB does not have a preventive mainte-
nance program and maintenance tends to be repair only after breakdown.
Assurance was obtained during negotiations that, following an analysis of
DSWB's operation and maintenance needs, a program and timetable for systematic
maintenance would be established by October 1986 to reduce the incidence of
breakdown and service disruption.
P. Billing and Collection
3.10     One operation area of noticeable improvement during project
preparation is billing and collection. In 1980, at the time of the Bank's
initial dialogue with BSWB, the utility generated very little revenue from
water sales; operating losses were high and large infusions of Government
subsidy were an annual requiTement. Since 1980, however, collections have
increased from about N1O0,000 to over I400,000 in 1982 and were expected to
top W1.0 m in 1984. The improved cash generation is the result of more
aggressive collection and the implementation of a new tariff structure enacted
in 1982. BSWB is also taking measures, including disconnection, to ensure
payment. There is yet a lot to be done. Billing is slow and tedious, records
are inadequate and are not properly kept.  BSWB recognizes the need for an
effective manager to its cash generation efforts and has recently appointed a
chief commercial officer. During negotiations assurance was obtained that
BSWB will agree to an annual plan with the Bank beginning January 1986 by
which progress on billing and collection, as measured by total billing and the
fraction of billing that is collected, will be determined.
C. Accounting
3.11     In 1980, BSWB attempted to establish a commercial accounting system.
Due to the lack of adequate skills within it and without outside assistance,
the new accounting system is highly unsatisfactory. As a first step towards
improving its bookkeeping and financial management, a basic accounting 8ystem
along the lines of the Manual of Accounting prepared by the Bank foT water
supply and sewerage utilities 8/ , would be instituted, following necessary
modifications, with the assistance of a financial controller and a financial
consultant to be financed by the project.  These financial experts who would
be recruited internationally in 1985 and 1986, respectively will, among other
things, supervise the commercial and accounting operations, and institute
appropriate systems to improve billing, bookkeeping and financial management
of BSIWB. These important positions may have to be filled under the project's
8/   Manual of Accounting, prepared by Robert Smith for World Bank (TWD), 1983
(Project File B2.).

technical assistance for several years, until suitable local staff can be
identified and attracted for recruitment or trained.
H. Audit
3.12     BSWB's Edict requires that it prepares annual accounts of its
functions to be audited by auditors appointed by the Commissioner 9/ . Its
first financial statements for 1981 and 1982 have been completed only recently
and an appropriate audit can be expected in the near future. Assurance was
obtained during negotiations that in the future BSWB's external audit will be
carried out by auditors acceptable to the Bank and the auditors' report
submitted within six months after the close of each fiscal year. BSWB has an
internal audit department but its capability to assume full and systematic
responsibility would need to be strengthened.
I. Insurance
3.13     BSWB's assets and stocks are not presently insured.  It was agreed
during negotiations that BSWB will, not later than December 31, 1985, present
an acceptable insurance plan to the Bank and will take insurance to cover the
goods to be supplied under the project.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Genesis
4.01     Following FGN's endorsement of BSG's request for Bank as8istance in
the development of its water sector plans (para 1.04), an exploratory Bank
mission visited Maiduguri in 1979.  This was followed by an identification
mission in 1980 which advised BSWB on the need for further project
preparation. In 1981 consultants, Dar Al-Handasah (Lebanon), were
commissioned by BSWB to prepare a feasibility study on the Maiduguri component
of the identified project. In 1981 and 1982 missions were undertaken to
review progress of preparation and help shape the project. The final report
of the feasibility study was submitted in March 1983, and the project was
appraised in May 1983. Detailed engineering and preparation of documentation
for tendering of major contracts are about to be completed.
B. ObJectives
4.02     The objectives of the project are:
9/   Originally, the Commissioner of the Ministry of Natural Resources.  In
1979, this responsibility devolved to the Deputy Governor of the State,
and in 1984 to the Governor.



- 14 -
(i)  to provide adequate and reliable supplies of safe water to Maiduguri
from the Lake Alau dam and reservoir (para 1.04);
(ii) to strengthen the BSWB by providing technical assistance and training
to enable it to undertake the orderly future development and
expansion of the State's water supply program, and its efficient
operation, and to help it towards financial viability; and
(iii) to provide the basis for an effective sanitation in Maiduguri through
the proposed studies.
C. Scope
4.03     A much larger project covering Maiduguri and other localities and for
which an allocation of N48.7 million had been made in the State's Fourth
Development Plan (1981-1985), was initially suggested by BSG. But, given the
prevailing stringent economic conditions in N.geria which have had the effect
of limiting the State's share of the federal revenues and the allocation to
the project, the scope of the project has been limited essentially to
k4aiduguri as the priority area end project horizon restricted to seven years.
This has reduced project costs from N140 million to N80.4 million requiring a
State input of N30.1 mi'lion. The reduced project is more in line with BSWB's
capability to operate and manage than tite larger one and would be easier for
BSG to finance.
D. Technological Alternatives
1. Raw Water Source
4.04     It has been recognized since 1964 that groundwater would not be
adLquate to meet water demands in Maiduguri past the mid-1980s'. Rapid
urbanization and industrialization have intensified the demands on this
resource to the extent that recent investigations suggested that water level
in the lower aquifer (the most productive aquifer in Maiduguri) has been
declining progressively, indicating overabstraction at the present rate of
pumping. Only limited yields are possible from the middle aquifer and the
upper aquifer is vulnerable to contamination because of its shallow depth in
places. The declining hydrostatic levels in the boreholes have necessitated
Lnore pumping than previously to produce the same amount of water which has
resulted in mounting operating costs. On-going studies will be intensified to
determine the cost-effectiveness of the continued operation of boreholes in
the project area where an alternative source of water would be available from
the Lake Alau reservoir. The reservoir will produce a usable annual stream
flow of 144 million m3 for joint water supply and irrigation uses. The
72 million m3 per year earmarked for water supply will be sufficient to meet
the water needs of Maiduguri past the year 2000. Depending on the results of
the study, some boreholes may be phased out and some may be decommissioned but
maintained in an operational condition as a supplementary source. Boreholes
in locations outside the project area would be refurbished as required to
improve productivity.

2. Treatment Process
4.05     The treatment process has been selected (Annex 4-1) with due
consideration to adaptability, ease and flexibility of operation and mainte-
nance. Process and operation modifications such as slew vs. rapid sand
filters, mixed media vs. sand filter, direct filtration, cross vs. radial flow
clarifiers and use of polyelectrolytes, have been evaluated 10/ . As the
characteristics of the water to be treated would not be known until after
completion of the Lake Alau dam, samples of Ngadda river water have been used
as reasonable substitutes and provision made in the design for process addi-
tion and/or modification as necessary to accommodate any unusual characteris-
tics as data on the raw water become available. Branch and loop distribution
systems as well as the method of feeding then, that is by gravity or pumping,
were evaluated together with the pipe routing to give the most economic
layout, subject to hydraulic considerations. The evaluation of alternative
processes and the basis of design are contained in the consultants' Design
Concept Report which is available in the project files II/
E. Project Description
4.06     The elements of the project are as follows:
1. Water Supply

F. Cost Estimates
4.07     The total estimated cost of the project is ?80.4 million (US$115.0 m)
including taxes and duties and with a foreign exchange component of
W42.0 million (US$60.1 mn) representing 52% of total costs. Details of the
cost estimates are presented in Annex 4-2 and summarized on the following

4.08     Project costs have been estimated based on preliminary designs of the
facilities, and on quotations from similar jobs recently bid in Nigeria. Where
such information is unavailable, appropriate cost models developed by the United
Kingdom Water Research Center have been applied and the costs adjusted by the
consultants on the basis of their experience. To these have been added the cost
of on-land transport which has been estimated at 35% of the CIF costs of
imported items. Alternative means of transport are being investigated to reduce
the onland costs. The cost estimates for the technical assistance program are
based on an average unit cost per person/month including travel, accommodation,



- 19 -
and other related costs. Estimates for consultants' services are based on FGN
scales of fees for consultants' services 12/ .
4.09     The foreign exchange component of project costs was computed by
assuming that all equipment supply contracts would be won by foreign firms. It
was also assumed that most of the large civil works would be won by foreign but
locally-established contractors, and that small local contractors are likely to
win most of the contracts for small diameter pipe (secondary and tertiary)
installation. The foreign exchange cost component of training, technical
assistance and consulting services is based on the nature of the services to be
performed, the length of time for which the services are required, and on the
assumption that most of the experts are expected to be foreigners.
4.10     Total project costs include an allowance of 10% for taxes and duties on
all directly imported goods. This has been included in the local cost component
and represents 5% of the total project costs. For the physical works component
of the project, a physical contingency allowance ranging from 5% (Equipment and
Plant) to 10% (Civil Works) has been made to compensate for unforeseen
additional work. In addition, allowance has been made for price contingencies
as follows:

G. Project Financing
4.11     The project would be financed as follows:

Government of Nigeria (Project File B-5.).

Bank financing 66% of total project costs net of taxes and duty
(US$109.4 million).
The Bank loan of US$72.0 million would cover the cost of the foreign exchange
component of the project and US$11.9 million of the local cost component. The
balance of the local cost would be met by the BSG. A contribution by BSWB is
not envisaged due to its inability to generate cash for investments before 199).
4.12     Co-financing was discussed with the borrower during project preparation
but, at their request, it was not pursued further.
4.13     The Bank loan would be made to the FGN for 20 years, including 5 years
of grace, at the prevailing variable interest rate. The proceeds of the loan
would be on-lent to BSG on identical terms. In view of BSWE's weak financial
state, assurances were obtained from BSG during negotiations that it would
onlend 80% of the Bank loan amount to BSWB on the Bank terms and conditions and
provide the remaining 20% of the Bank loan together with its own contribution to
BSWB as equity. This would result in a project financing by approximately 50%
debt and 50% equity. (For purposes of the financial projections the interest
rate on the Bank loan has been assumed at 10%). BSG would pay the commitment
charge on the loan and bear the foreign exchange risk. The execution of
subsidiary loan agreements between FGN and BSG, and between BSG and BSWB, would
be a condition of loan effectiveness.
H. Implementation
4.14     BSWB would be the implementing agency for the project and would be
assisted by consultants. The envisaged implementation schedule is shown on the
following page. A project coordinator within BSWB has been appointed. BSWB has
retained Dar Al-Handasah, the consultants who did the feasibility study, to
prepare detailed design and tender documents for the water supply and
distribution components of the project and to assist in the evaluation of
tenders. Terms of reference for these assignments have been reviewed and judged
to be acceptable to the Bank. Discussions are underway to extend the
consultants' contract to include supervision of construction, which is scheduled
to start in June 1986 and to be completed in 1992. Construction would be
carried out mostly by contractors.

4.15     BSWB will require further consulting services to prepare design and
tender documents for the other components of the project including the head-
quarters building and zonal workshops and to prepare specifications for the
mechanical and electrical items such as generators and driLling rigs. BSWB has
reached agreement with Dar Al-Handasah to extend its current contract to cover
these additional services.
4.16     BSWB will also require technical assistance to install proper financial
management and control systems, improve billing and collections, operate the
treatment facilities, strengthen and improve management and institutionalize
training (para 3.05). Possibilities are being explored to involve a water
utility from a developed country before January 31, 1986 in the technical
assistance and training program by secondment of staff for varying periods of
time to BSWB.  Use of service firms or individual experts to staff the technical
assistance program is being considered concurrently in case the envisaged and
preferred "twinning" arrangement does not materialize.  A coordinated action
program covering the recruitment of the technical assistance team and target
dates by which specified actions should be taken was agreed upon during
negotiations ar.d is presented as Annex 4-3. It is intended that BSWB wouLd
recruit a financial controller in 1985. Payment for his services, as well as
for the consulting engineers for detailed design would be made partly through
the PPF.
I. Procurement
4. 17     Contracts for the supply and installation of treatment plant
equipment, pumps, pipes, meters, rigs and generators and other items estimated
to cost above US$250,000 as well as civil works contracts for the constructiom
of the treatment facilities, transmission mains and ground and elevated storage
reservoirs would be awarded under international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. Prequalification would be required.
Procurement of vehicles, spare parts, and miscellaneous supplies under contract
estimated to cost more than US$100,000 but less than US$250,000, or equivalent
for equipment and US$250,000, or equivalent for civil works would be procured on
the basis of competitive bidding, locally advertised, conducted in accordance
with procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Contracts for the purchase of goods
estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$100,00D would be procured on
the basis of negotiated purchases after solicitation of price quotations from at
least three established and reliable suppliers. Domestically manufactured goods
would be allowed 15% preference or the applicable import duty, whichever is
lower, for the purposes of bid evaluation. Consultants for the various studies
and specialists recruited under the project for technical assistance and
training would be selected on the basis of qualifications and experience and on
terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.
4.18     Arrangements for the procurement of goods and services under this
project are presented in Annex 4-4 and summarized in the following table with
the categories proposed for Bank financing shown in brackets:

a/ Contracts in this category would be awarded on the basis of experience and
qualifications of the individual candidates and on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank.
4.19     liigerian law requires that foreign contractors operating in Nigeria be
incorporated in the country with local ownership of 60%. Many large foreign
contractors are already established on this basis in Nigeria and will be strong
competitors for obtaining project contracts. However, the magnitude of a few
contracts to be let is likely to attract additional foreign competi- tion.
During negotiations of the Fifth Power Project (Loan 1766-UNI) in 1979
assurances were given that foreign companies executing Bank-assisted projects
would not be affected by federal guidelines requiring incoTporation within a
year of their arrival in Nigeria. Such assurances were obtained for this
project during negotiations. The bidding documents wiLl require that all
companies should employ some Nigerian staff in order to promote the transfer of
skills and technology from expatriate staff to Nigerians.
4.20     Ongoing projects are plagued by inadequate local counterpart funding.
Delayed and inadequate Government funding results not only in delayed project
implementation and under-utilization of Bank-financed equipment and manpower,
but also in delayed Bank reimbursement of eligible local expenditures which
require Government pre-financing. Given the financial constraints currently
facing the Government of Nigeria, project implementation would be significantly
improved if funds are provided in advance from the Bank loan to pre-finance
reimbursable local costs. Accordingly, an advance of US$600,000 would be nade to
a Special Account, to be established on terms and conditions acceptabLe to the
Bank. Amounts advanced to this account would be used to finance the Bank's



- 24 
share of expenditures in local costs, as well as small foreign expenditures, and
replenishment of the Special Account would be subject to submission of
satisfactory documentation evidencing amounts withdrawn from the Special
Account. Disbursements would be made on the basis of statements of expenditures
(SOEs) for the following items: (a) civil works contracts of less than
US$100,000 equivalent; (b) equipment and material contracts of Less than
US$20,000 equivaleat; (c) consultant and technical assistance contracts of less
than US$20,000 equivalent and (d) costs of training programs. Documents related
to these items would be retained by BSWB and made available upon request for
review by visiting Bank missions. Annual audit reports would include a separate
opinion covering amounts withdrawn from the Loan Account on the basis of SOEs.
J. Disbursements

4.22      BSG's contributions would be paid into a project account.  The
establishment of such an account and the preLimincz.ry estinates of the
amounts needed (shown below) were discussed and agreed with BSG during
negotiations.

Revised and updated estimates of these contributions would be made annually
and BSG advised accordingly.  Payments would be on a quarterly basis and
should be made in the quarter preceding the one in which the funds would be
required.  The establishment of the project account and payment of the
first installment of N2.0 million would be a condition of loan
effectiveness. Subsequent tiaely payments which would be subject to regular
review by Bank staff and an annuaL audit, would be a covenant in the legal
documents. In the event of BSG defaule, FGN would be authorized to pay
directly to the project account that part of the State's statutory
allocation corresponding to its agreed financial support for the project.
Implications of these counterpart contributions and the required
operational grants for the upcomiag years on BSG's budget are described in
para 5.12.
4.23     The estimated schedule of disbursement of the loan is shown in
Annex 4-6. The schedule is based on the average disbursement profile for
water supply projects in West Africa which appears applicable to this
project.  The closing date of the loan would be December 31, 1993.

4.24     BSWB will subnit to the Bank, until project completion, quarterly
reports on the progress of the project, including meeting institutional and
financial objectives. Monitoring criteria to be included to the reporting
requirements are listed in Annex 4-5. BSWB will also prepare a completion
report within six months of the completion of loan disbursements.
V.  FINiANCIAL SITUATI0N AND PROSPECTS OF BSWB
A. Past and Present Financial Situation
5.01     Since its conversion to a self-accounting agency in February 1980
tuntil today, BSWB's finances have been almost completely dependent on State
Government fuads which are received as subsidies. These subsidies are not
defined in their purposes. As a result, BSWB uses them to cover first its
losses from operations and invests what remainS. The State allocations are
highly irregular.  They amounted to N25 million in 1981 and to only 15
million in 1982. As the latter amount was less than the operational
shortfall in that year, there -.ere no funds left for investments. For 1983
and 1984, Government transferred to the Board only N375,000 per month to
cover mainly BSWB's payroll.
5.02     The role of revenues as a means of financing has only recently
been acknowledged. Water rates, exclusively flat rates, were low,
collection was aot enforced, and illegal connections were xampant. As a
result of the dialogue with Bank missions in the course of project
preparation, BSWB has achieved considerable progress in these respects.
Collections of about 1100,000 in 1980 were doubled in 1981 and again
doubled in 1982. In 1983, revenues again increased by almost 100% and
revenues in 1984 exceeded
1I1.O million. Tbis positive trend is due to a strengthening of the
commercial department in manpower and in executive powers, and to a tariff
increase in mid-1982. The increase of the existing flat rates was 50%, but
more important was the introduction of metered tariffs along with the
installation of meters for larger consumers, both commercial and private.
Although 2,000 meters had been procured, their installation has been slow
due to the lack of adequate connectors. Receipts from a few customers have
shown that revenues from metered large consumers can be very much higher
than the formerly applied flat rate.  To tap this source of revenue to the
full extent BSVB intends to buy more meters and connection material under
the FPF (paTr 2.09).
B. Tariffs
5-03     BSWB has an extremely complicated tariff system which identifies
and subsequently charges consumers by a variety of distinctions, but all on
a flat rate. Thus it depends for billing on information from its



- 27 -
customers, such as number of taps in the building, nunber of bedrooms,
flush toilet or not, number of beds in the hospital, of classes in the
schools, and hangers in the slaughterhouse. It is obvious that such a
situation leads to negligence on both sides, and since tariffs were low, a
better or worse billing and collection did not have a significant impact on
BSWB's finance. Revenues were only accounted for from collections, not
from billing, and receivables were, therefore, not recorded as an asset.
The true income-generating value of the existing tariffs could never be
established in this way, and the recent increase was just an exercise to
improve revenues without any target for cost recovery.
5.04     The current flat rate structure for domestic consumption and the
new rates for metered consumption are shown below:
BSWB - Flat Rate and Metered Tariffs
(i)   Domestic Flat rate in N per month:
House with single tap                               3.00  ($4.30)
House with 2 bedrooms and toilet                    4.00  ($5.70)
House with more than 2 bedrooms and toilet          6.00  ($8.60)
(ii) Domestic rates per m3 in W:
Monthly consumption up to 68 m3                     0.28  ($0.40)
Monthly consumption between 68 and 136 m3           0.44  ($0.63)
Monthly consumption above 136 m3                    0.55  ($0.80)
(iii) Industrial and Commercial rates per ii in N:
Monthly consumption up to 2,272 m3                  0.66  ($0.94)
Monthly consumption between 2,272 and 4,545 m3   0.72  ($1.03)
Monthly consumption above 4,545 m3                  0.77  ($1.10)
5.05     It appears that the new tariffs represent a step in the right
direction towards cost recovery.  However, the lowest doaestic rate may be
too high for the lower income population whose basic consumpticn need is
generally considered not to exceed 20 m3 per family per month. The new
monthly charge for this consumption would be US$8.0D compared to the flat
rate of IIS$4.30. To adjust the present tariff structure and to possibly
simplify it, especially in view of the planned switch from flat rates to full
metering, a tariff study would be carried out under the project. As reliable
information on BSWB's cost of production and distribution are not yet
available and basic accounting systems would be developed during the next two
years, it is recommended that the tariff study be carried out in 1986.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the recommendations of the
tariff study, as agreed with the Bank, would be implemented to ensure that
the financial targets of BSWB, specified in para 5.08, would be attained.
5.06     BSWB acknowledges that there are a number of private boreholes in
Maiduguri, and probably elsewhere in the Project area. Most of them belong
to institutional and commercial establishments. In strict terms, they
represent illegal sources of water supply, but BSWB has tolerated their
existence since it has not been able to meet the demand of these customers.
However, this situation should be reconciled with the Edict which assigns the
sole right to produce water to BSWB. BSWB could, therefore, issue limited



- 28 -
licenses and charge a fee for the groundwater abstraction. These individual
abstractions have contributed to the declining groundwater level which is
forcing BSWB to invest In surface water transmission and treatment.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that BSWB identifies and
registers all non-BSWB operated boreholes, issues limited licenses to their
owners with the provision either to close them when regular public supp;; is
available, or pay adequate license fees for their continued operation.
C. Future Financial Performance
5.07     The future financial performance of BSWB as a whole will depend very
much on the financial results of its operations in Maiduguri, the project
area. The proposed investments will strain BSWB's financial capacities, but
will equally offer an opportunity for substantial returns, if the investments
are used to enhance BSWB's operations and if financial discipline is
introduced and maintained. Accordingly, financial projections are shown in
Annexes 5-1 to 5-3 for the Maiduguri operations, and in Annexes 5-4 to 5-6
for BSWB as a whole. The assumptions on which the financial projections are
based are described in detail in Annex 5-7.
5.08     BSWB keeps separate accounts for Maiduguri so that actual figures
for 1982 are available. Projections have been carried out for Maiduguri
until 1995, when the second-phase of investments, complement to the proposed
project, is scheduled to be completed. At the present, water charges are
extremely low, but an immediate increase to achieve full cost recovery does
not appear feasible for operational and political reasons. It seems
possible, however, to increase revenues gradually so that recurrent
expenditures are covered by 1986 and full cost recovery, including
depreciation on fixed assets and interest on loans, is achieved by 1989.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that tariffs will be set at
levels which allow for coverage of all operational expenditures in Maiduguri
not later than 1986, and generate earnings not later than 1990. From 1990
onward, a rate of return on revalued net fixed asseats in operation of not
less than 5% for Maiduguri and 2% for BSWB should be &'zhieved anually. This
tariff policy would ensure that BSWB could service its debt incurred for the
project and, moreover, accumulate sufficient cash to contribute at least 25%
of the second-phase investments and also carry out minor investments
completely from its internal sources. Salient features of the financial
projections for Maiduguri are summarized in the following table:

5.09     While the future financial performance in Maiduguri can be projected
on the basis of reliable data, forecasts for BSWB as a whole are, as noted,
difficult to make. There is no planning instrument for the sector and no
target for supply achievements for the population outside Maiduguri except a
firmly expressed but vaguely defined priority for water supply. From various
alternatives for BSWB's future performance, a scenario for projections has
been selected which takes into account the generally acknowledged need for
BSWB's financial viability in the medium-term which would shift Government
funds from operational subsidies to productive investment support. This
could be achieved in three steps:
(i) for the immediate future, BSWB will need operational subsidies to
compensate for the lack of cash generation due to operational
losses;
(ii) in subsequent years, although losses still occur, Government funds
will be needed for investments, for which ]SWB's internal cash
generation is not yet sufficient; and
(iii) in the 1990s, after having reached profitability, BSWB might be able
to generate enough funds to finance important investments mainly on
its own or to service its debts if loans are needed.
Projections for BSWB have been calculated to the year 1990 and are summarized
below. Detailed forecasts for the period after 1990 can hardly be carried
out without haphazard guessing.

5.10     Since the Maiduguri financial situation is embedded in the overall
financial status of BSWB, minimum requirements to ensure the successful
implementation of the project, both physically and institutionally are
necessary. Assurance was, therefore, obtained during negotiations that, in
addition to the revenue covenants for Maiduguri (para 5.08), BSG will make
grants amounting to at least the level of operational losses available to
BSWB. Furthermore, to assess the need for further grants, BSWB is required
to establish cost accounting data for its non-profitable rural and semi-urban
supply schemes by the end of 1985 and submit to the Bank not later than June
1986 a financing plan, including statewide investments, on the basis of which
BSG and the Bank will agree on a program of financial support for BSWB from
BSG for the period 1987 to 1991.
D. Financing Requirements
5.11     A financing plan for the period until 1991, the project implementa-
tion period, is shown below.  It is assumed that investments outside the
project are mainly boreholes and will be carried out by BSWB using its



- 32 -
existing equipment and labor force. These investments are, therefore, not
included in the Financing Plan.

5.12     It is estimated that during the project implementation period an
average of 22% of BSG's annual investment funds would be required as
counterpart funds to the project with the peak coming in 1987. In addition to
the capital investment requirements, about 2% of BSG's annual recurrent
expenditure would need to be allocated as operational grant to BSWB during the
earlier years (1985-87). It would appear, based on the assumption that Borno
State would make no other major commitments for investments up to 1987 except
the Southern Borno Agricultural Development Project, that the State should
have enough resources to meet the requirements of the proposed project.
VI. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Project Benefits
6.01     The principal benefit of the project will be an increase in the
quantity of water sttpplied to the population of Maiduguri.  Extensions to the
distribution system vill make it possible to supply water more reliably and at
higher quantities then at present. The project is expected to have a positive
impact on the urban poor, through increases both in the number of individual
connections and in the density of standpipe coverage in the poorer areas. As
important a benefit is expected also on the institutional side. BSWB should
be, as a result of the project, in a position to progress towards becoming a
sound and financially viable water utility. Thus, the burden on Borno State's
finances should decrease in the years to come.
B. Least Cost Analysis
6.02     Current groundwater sources will not be sufficient to meet
anticipated demand for water after 1988. Estimated recharge levels of the



- 33 -
aquifers underlying the Maiduguri area are such that it wlll not be possible
to develop new sources - indeed the output of the current sources is likely to
steadily fall over time with increasing danger of overpumping (para 4.04).
There is, therefore, a need to utilize a surface water source. The Chad Basin
Development Agency (CBDA) is to construct a multipurpose (water supply and
irrigation) dam at Lake Alau, over the period 1984-86, with N16 million
financing from FGN. The first use of this water, estimated at a potential
72 million m3 per annum, will be for Maiduguri urban water supply. Starting
in 1989, BSWB will purchase water at an assumed cost of NO.6 million per year.
This sum would pay for those costs of the Alau dam investments related to
water supply.
6.03     The distribution system has been designed to supply the maximum
number of consumers at minimum acceptable service levels at least cost.
Project investments in the primary network would be designed to meet increased
water demand over the next 12 to 15 years. To minimize risks and over-
investment, secondary and tertiary network extensions under the project will
focus on the densely populated areas, and not on areas of prospective, but
uncertain growth.
C. Marginal Cost and Rate of Return
6.04     The long-run marginal cost of water resulting from the project
investments as approximated by the average incremental cost (AIC) has been
calculated at NO.54/m3. This compares with BSWB's current average revenue of
NO.08/m3. Significant increases in tariffs will, therefore, be needed for
prices to reflect marginal costs, and thus to signal the resource cost to the
consumers.
6.05     The economic rate of return (ERR) for the Maiduguri components with
(i) the incremental water supplies including supply by standpipe as a result
of the project as benefits, and (ii) project investments, incremental
operating costs and replacements over the life of the project as costs, has
been calculated at 6%. This ERR understates the full benefits likely to be
derived from the project, since positive externalities, such as improved
health and productivity as the result of better availability and quality of
water cannot be quantified, Also, consumers' surplus is not captured, yet
true valuation of benefits should conceptually use the demand price for water,
which is difficult to establish. It is likely that for most groups of
consumers, particularly low income earners, this price exceeds the proposed
tariff levels. Prices paid to water vendors in Maiduguri while obviously only
for small quantities, are of the order of N6 to N15/m3. Calculations of the
AIC and ERR are shown in Annex 6.



- 34 -
6.06     Various sensitivity tests have been carried out, the results of which
are summarized below:
Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and Sensitivity Analysis
Base Case                                      6.1
Capital Cost                          +20      4.8
-20     7.8
Recurrent Cost                        +20      5.4
-20     6.8
Benefit                               +20     8.1
-20     3.7
All Cost up 10%, Benefits down 10%             3.9
As would be suspected variations in the capital cost would affect the ERR much
more than changes in recurrent costs, at a ratio of 2 to 1 (for cost
variations of + 20%). Obviously, variations on the benefit side (e.g., higher
or lower tariffs, increased sales in earlier years to reach full capacity
faster) would have significant impact on the ERR, in particular as under the
base case they start to accrue only following a considerable lag after the
major investments have been carried out.
D. Affordability 6.07       Income distribution data for Maiduguri are scarce;
the sources of information are an occupational analysis of the work force, and
a study of
incomes of four Northern Nigerian towns (including Maiduguri), both undertaken
in 1973 by consultants 13/ . From this information, and from survey
information on urban areas in Borno State provided by the Nigeria Federal
Office of Statistics, it is estimated that median household income was of the
order of N250 per month in 1983, and that income distribution was as follows:
13/ Feasibility Report, Vol. 2, prepared by Dar Al-Handasah Consultants,
August 1981. (Project File Bl.).

Maiduguri Income Distribution on Basis of Median Income
of N250 per Household per Month in 1983
Income of:          As Proportion of Median Income   N

2nd decile                       0.5                  125
3rd decile                       0.6                  150
4th decile                       0.7                  175
5th decile                       1.0                  250
6th decile                       1.2                  300
8th decile                       1.4                  350
6.08     Assuming .hat payments for water should not exceed 4 to 5% of the
monthly household incomes in order for this service to remain affordable,
calculations were carried out to establish some "thresholds". At current
tariffs, flat rates for unmetered properties are N3 or N4 per month depending
on the nature of the acconmodation, i.e. threshold household income would be
N60 - N80 per month. At a metered rate of NO.60/m3, approximately the
projected average tariff level by 1990 (in constant 1983 prices), a household
of the average size of six persons consuming 50 lcd would spend N5/month for
water supply, or only about 2% of its monthly income, if this household is at
the poverty level 14/ . At this assumed tariff level, the lowest 20% would
have difficulties in absorbing these costs, however they would be served
through public standpipes (of which 300 would be financed under the Project)
and the consumption billed to the Maiduguri Local Government.
E. Impact on the Urban Poverty Group
6.09     The urban poverty group is estimated to include about 45X of the
Maiduguri population, or over 130,000 persons in 1982.  This group currently
relies on supplies from public standpipes, or in certain parts of the city
from water vendors.  The project will benefit this urban poverty group (as
also the cther Maiduguri inhabitants) through the expansion of the distri-
bution network which will improve services in the areas of the highest
population densities, which are precisely where this group is concentrated;
the rehabilitation of the existing 254 standpipes and the construction of
additional 300 standpipes to improve the access from 500 to 450
personslstandpipe; and by providing better quality water compared with the
existing situation which should lead to improved health conditions. The group
will account for approximately 16% of the total consumption by 1990. A 62%
increase in water supply is expected as a result of the project. Approximately
half of this increase would benefit Maiduguri's underpriviledged group. Thus,
30% of the proposed Bank loan or US$22 million could be considered as poverty
lending. Improvements in water supply form an Integral part of Borno State's
14/ The relative urban poverty threshold in Nigeria is estimated to be
N400/per capita in 1983.



- 36 -
plans to improve urban infrastructure. Part of the project will be to finance
a study to determine the requirements and optimum organization for drainage,
sewerage and solid *.aste disposal. Poor sanitation in Maiduguri is a major
hazard to the poor urban dweller at present.
F. Project Risks
6.10     One risk associated with the project pertains to securing the source
of raw water, the Alau dam. To minimize this risk, negotiations had been made
contingent upon the initiation of construction of the dam. Dam construction
has now started. To assure adequate and timely counterpart funding, a
schedule establishing BSG contributions to the project was agreed upon during
negotiations (para 4.23). Technical risks for this project stem from BSWB's
inexperience with the proposed treatment facilities. The provision of
technical assistance under the project to facilitate plant operation in the
early years and to train BSWB staff to eventually take over this
responsibility would reduce this risk.
G. Environmental Considerations
6.11     No environmental issues are apparent.
VlI.  &GREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A.  Agreements
7.01            During negotiations, assurances were obtained from:
(a)  Federal Government of Nigeria that the necessary funds would be made
available to ensure that the Alau Dam would be completed by June
1986 (para 1.04);
(b)  Borno State Government that It will:
(i) engage consultants to carry out a master plan for sanitation -
drainage, sewerage and solid waste dispcsal, for Maiduguri,
including optimal arrangements for institutional xesponsibility
of this subsector by year end 1987 (para 4.06);
(ii)   onlend to BSWB 80% of the Bank loan on terms and conditions
equivalent to those of the Bank and provide the remaining 20% of
the Bank loan together with its own contributions as equity to
BSWB (para 4.13);
(iii)   make an initial deposit of N2 million to the project account in
1984, which is also a condition of effectiveness (para 7.02).
Subsequent contributions to the project would be made quarterly
and in advance and would amount to N1.25 million per quarter in
1986; 11.75 million per quarter in 1987 and 1988; N1.20 million



- 37 -
per quarter in 1989; N0.7 miLlion per quarter in 1990, and
NO.375 million per quarter in 1991. In the event of BSG
default, FGN would be authorized to pay directly to the project
account that part of the State's statutory allocation
corresponding to its agreed financial support for the project
(para 4.23);
(iv)   provide BSWB with the necessary funds paid in regular
installments, to cover its operational losses (para 5.09 (i));
(c)  Borno State Water Board that it will:
(i)  appoint training consultants under terms of reference acceptable
to the Bank and a Nigerian training manager before December 1985
(para 3.08);
(ii) design before October 1986 a preventive maintenance program to
reduce the incidence of breakdown and service disruption
(para 3.09);
(iii) agree to an annual plan with the Bank beginning
January 1986 by which progress on billing and collection as
measured by total billing and the fraction of billing that is
collected will be determined (para 3.10);
(iv) employ external auditors acceptable to the Bank and submit the
auditors' report within six months after the close of each
fiscal year (para 3.12);    i
(v) present an acceptable insurance plan to the Bank not later than
December 31, 1985 and take insurance to cover the goods to be
supplied under the project (para 3.13);
(vi) prior to the scheduled dates of the following tasks, recruit
international experts, acceptable to the Bank, to assist in the:
(A)  establishment of proper financial management and control
systems, including billing and collection in January 1986
(para 3.11);
(B)  operation of the treatment plant due to be completed in
1989 and the improvement of the management of BSWB
(para 4.06 - 3 (i)(a));
(C)  supervision of construction of project works starting in
June 1986 (para 4.06 - (1)(a));
(vii) submit to the Bank, starting in the fourth quarter of 1985 and
until project completion, quarterly reports on the progress of
the project and prepare a completion report within six months of
the completion of loan disbursements (para 4.24).



- 38 -
(viii) have a tariff study carried out by consultants during 1986 the
recommendations of which are to be implemented after
consultation with the Bank (para 5.05);
(ix)  identify and register all non-BSWB operated boreholes and issue
limited licenses to their owners by December 1985, with
provisions to either close them when public water supply is
available and reliable, or pay license fees foT their continued
operation (para 5.06);
(x)  set its tariffs at levels which will ensure coverage of
recurrent expenditures not later than 1986 and generate
surpluses not later than 1990 which should represent a rate of
return on average net fixed assets in operation, periodically
revalued, of not less than 52 for Maiduguri and 2% for BSWB
(para 5.08);
(xi)  establish a cost aceaunting system for its operations in (A)
Maiduguri, (B) other towas and (C) the rural areas, and submit
to the Bank, not later than June 1986, a financing plan
Including statewide Investments, on the basis of which a medium-
term program for necessary state subsidies can be developed
(para 5.10).
B. Conditions of Effectiveness
7.02  (a)  Execution of an agreement between CBDA and BSWB, satisfactory to
the Bank, on water releases from lake Alau dam (para 1.03);
(b) The execution of subsidiary loan agreements between FGN and BSG,
and betveen BSG and BSWB (pare 4.13);
(c) Establishment of a project account and the payment by BSG of the
first installment of W2.0 million Into it (para 4.22).
C. Recommendation
7.03       Subject to the above agreements and conditions, the proposed
project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$72.0 million at the prevailing
terms.

FROH A,AU DAM RESERVOIR
Please refer you letter -BWB/S/146IVol. 1-111450 of 7th November, 1981. it is
stated therein that the water requirerment for Maiduguri which was only 6.5 million
cubic meter per aninum in 1980 shall jump to 82 million cubic meter in the year 2000.
This appears a very steap rise in demand and may be on the higher side.  Consultants
in 1978 had envisaged that the annual demand shall be of the order of 60 million
cubic meter with a maximum limit of 76 mnil.lioni cubic meter for Maiduguri urbani water
supply.
2. The dam is scheduled to be completed according to the present programmes of
work by end of 1984. Tenders have been received and adjudication is in progress.
The memorandum on tenders is being presented to the Authority's Board schedule-d to
be held in May, 1982. The conistruction of the dam may be taken up in the current
financial year if the financial situation improves.

3.  On completion of the project, the management of the dam and regulation
of water will be the responsibility of the Authority according to general policy
on Water Resources Development. The raw water required for the Water Board will
of course be supplied on priority basis in case of severe drought; otherwise on
normal years sharing of water shall be on 50 - 50 basis between Borno State Water
Board for urban water supply and Chad Basin Development Authority for irrigation
purposes for the proposed Jere Bowl Rice Scheme.
4. The water charges for bulk raw water supply shall be worked but in due
course and shall be mutually agreed between the Borno State Government and Chad
Basin Development Authority. The Water Board may therefore plan their future develop-
ment of urban water supply for Maiduguri town based on the above facts and figures.

BORN4O STATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
BORNO STATE WATER BHCRD
MANPOWER AND TRAINING
Present Situation
1.1       The manpower strength of BSWB as of December 1982, less daily
rated staff, amounted to 1,060 personnel employed on water supply,
sewerage and drainage operations. A manpower summary giving the
distribution of these staff to the operating units and departments is
given in Attachment 1. The 1983 budget estimates for BSWB indicate a
substantial increase of permanent staff in-post as compared with the 586
staff indicated by the consultant Dar Al-Handasah as being held at end
of February 1981. Current data on daily-rated staff were not available
but were estimated to number about one-third of permanent staff
strength. An additional 600 positions were approved by BSG for FY83 but
this recruitment target is unrealistic both ir terms of BSWB's ability
to recruit such a number and to meet their payroll costs. The size of
the current manpower complement and the overall deficiency of trained
manpower confirms the need for BSWB to develop a greater in-service
training capability than is now available.
1.2       The need to reduce BSWB's dependence on expatriates to fill
professional and managerial positions represents a major, longer term,
manpower development requirement. The Board currently employs a total
of 19 expatriates at GS Grade 9 and above. Ten of the fifteen officiers
filling the highest managerial grades, i.e., 12 to 16, are expatriates.
While not seen as a project issue, the gradual erosion of employment
benefits available to expatriates in Nigeria could create difficulties
for BSWB in retaining expatriates during the long lead time required to
develop and prepare local staff for senior professional and management
poisitions.
1.3       The recent creation of a small training school provides
evidence of BSWB's commitment to training. The rationale for the school
has been modeled on the experience of the Kaduna State Water Board
(KSWB) which had originally identified the first training priority to be
a substantial in-service training program for Assistant Works
Superintendents (AWS). The BSWB training program consists, therefore,
of a one-year AWS course which, as in the case of KSWB, is in great
demand by external state water agencies whose candidates fill about
two-thirds of the course places available. The need to expand BSWB's
training program to address a broader range of administrative and
technical training needs was readily agreed upon and accepted by the
senior management staff. BSWB has a total complement of 40 works
superintendents, from AWS (Grade 06) to Chief Works Superintendent
(Grade 13). With staff turnover in these grades averaging around 6% per
year there is no itistification for the present level of AWS training,

ANNEX 3-2

particularly as it is provided to the exclusion of all other in-service
training needs.
1.4       The AWS School has good classroom and office accommodation and
is well located close to the main workshop complex. It occupies a site
with ample room for expansion. The School is managed by a Principal,
who is an expatriate, and a Vice-Principal supported by a small
administrative staff.
Sector Training Facilities
2.1       An important current development in Nigeria is the
establishment by Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and
Rural Development (FMAWR) of a National Water Resources Institute (NWRI)
now in partial operation at Kaduna. Currently NWRI provides the
following training programs on a regular basis:
(a) Two-year national diploma (ND) program in water resources
engineering;
(b) One-year pre-qualification course for the ND program;
(c)  Four-year higher national diploma (HND) program in water
resources engineering; and
(d) Two-year certification program for hydrological
assistants.
The Kaduna Polytechnic also offers a four-year program in
water resources engineering and Ramat Polytechnic in Maiduguri will also
introduce a two-year program in water technology commencing in October
1983. A further recent development of importance to the Nigeria Water
Sector is the introduction by Ahmadu Bello University, Nigeria's largest
university, of undergraduate and graduate level programs in Water
Resources Engineering.
2.2       Substantial in-service programs are in process of being
developed by KSWB and the Anambra State Water Corporation (ASWC) under
the training components included in the ongoing Bank-financed projects,
Loans 1711-UNI and 2036-UNI respectively. In May 1983 renewed interest
was expressed by PMAWR in a Bank-financed technical assistance project
to further develop and broaden the sector-wide services provided by the
NWRI. These would include the provision of manpower and training
advisory services to assist state water agencies to develop training
programs and resources within national guidelines.
The Proposed BSWB Training Program
3.1       The training program to be designed and implemented under the
project would have two main thrusts. The first would be directed to the



- 46 -
ANNEX 3-2
Page 3
development and expansion of the existing AWS School to become a
training department, staffed and equipped to enable it to meet BSWB's
priority in-service training requirements in financial, commercial and
technical functions up to the level of Works Superintendents, or
equivalent. Priority training programs would include basic and
refresher training in plant and pipeline maintenance, meter reading,
commercial management and basic book-keeping. The limited regional
training service currently provided by the AWS School would continue.
The second thrust of the training plan would be to:
(a) identify staff positions in all disciplines above GS
Grade 09 which require pre-entry formal 'Iucation and
training of at least diploma level; z.d
(b) establish a manpower development and succession program
incorporating programs and resources within and, if
required, external to Nigeria which, implemented over the
longer term, would fill the identified staff positions
with Nigerian candidates.
3.2       The project training component would consist of the following
elements:
(a) The adequacy and deployment of the existing work force,
currently amounting to about 1,000 personnel employed in
water supply, sewerage and drainage operations, will be
reviewed in relation to the consultant's organization and
management study. The review would include a detailed
forecast of the additional manpower required, if any, by
occupational categories, over the project period of a
broad forecast of manpower required for the remainder of
the decade, up to 1990.
(b) A detailed assessment of the performance of technical,
administrative and financial staff will be undertaken to
determine training needs based upon a comparison between
job requirements and observed levels of competence.
(c) The training needs assessment of BSWB would be
complemented by the identification, review and assessment
of existing training activities, programs and resources
within and external to the Nigeria water sector in terms
of their relevance and capacity to meet the training
needs identified. Special consideration will be given to
BSWB's long term utilization of the Higher National
Diploma Program in Water Resource Engineering currently
provided, inter-alia, by NWRI, Kaduna, and the graduate
and post-graduate water resource engineering programs
provided by Ahmadu Bello University, at Zaria.

ANNEX 3-2
Page 4
(d) A senior level Training Steering Committee will be
appointed, responsible for advising the Board and the
Managing Director on manpower development and for
monitoring training activities throughout BSWB. The
first task of the Committee would be to formulate and
publish a Training Policy Statement for BSWB. The
Committee would also prepare a corporate manpower and
training plan, to be set out in detail for one year
ahead, and in outline for at least the period covering
project implementation.
(e) A formal training organization would be developed
starting initially with the selection and appointment of
a Nigerian Training Manager (at least Grade 12) and two
Training Development Officers (Grade 08). Provision
would be made for these staff to be trained specifically
for their roles, if necessary in an overseas water sector
training organization. The Training Manager should
complete his training program prior to the commencement
of the manpower review and training needs assessment.
(f) Emphasis would be given in the first Corporate Training
Plan to a deliberate and sustained program of educating
all managers and superintendents in their personal
responsibilities for training their subordinate staff.
(g) The forecast of BSWB's in-house training requirements
indicates an annual training load of about 500 man-weeks.
It is unlikely that this commitment can be met solely
through on-the-job training. The scope and need for BSWB
operated, off-the-job, training facilities would be
evaluated within the scope of the comprehensive manpower
and training survey. Financial provision for expansion
of the existing AWS School and its conversion to a
training center will be included in the project training
component.
(h) The present size, planned expansion and overall
dispersion of Rural Water Supply Operations, creates a
need for special training arrangements to be developed
within the framework of the Corporate Training Plan.
Under the direction of the Training Department, training
programs for the operation and preventive maintenance of
rural water systems, covering each phase of system
development, will be provided on a decentralized basis,
at selected operational installations in each district
area. Installations selected for this purpose will be
designated as Training Installations but will continue to
provide a normal water supply service. Instruction will



- 48 -
ANNEX 3-2
Page 5
be provided by District Office AWS, assisted by the
Training Department as required.
(i) A staff secondment and fellowship program will be drawn
up by the Training Steering Committee. The primary aim
of the program will be to reduce BSWB's dependence upon
expatriate staff currently occupying senior management,
professional and specialist positions. The project
training component will finance up to 15 man-years of
overseas training program which will emphasize the
development of practical skills and experience in
progressive and well-managed water utilities.
(j) In line with the rationale of the Bank-financed training
components for the Kaduna and Anambra Water Supply
Projects (Loans 1711-UNI and 2036-UNI), the BSWB
corporate training plan will be devised with a view to
making selected "common needs" training programs
available to neighboring State water agencies which, as
yet, have no organized programs of theiT own.
Consideration will be given to this requirement by the
BSWB Training Steering Committee during the preparation
of the first annual corporate training plan.
3.3       The manpower review, assessment of training needs and detailed
formulation of the initial corporate training plan would require the
assistance of a training consultant. The consultant, together with
BSWB's Personnel Manager and Training Manager, would work closely with
other technical assistance personnel to be financed under the project
and, in particular, with the financial consultant. In this way, special
training needs identified by any member of the technical assistance team
would be incorporated, where appropriate, into the overall BSWB training
plan.
3.4       The total cost of the training component is estimated to be
US$866,000 of which about US$746,000 would be foreign exchange to be
financed under the proposed loan. Detailed cost estimates are given in
Attachment 2.
3.5       The above proposals were discussed with BSWB during appraisal
and were agreed in principle. During negotiations BSWB agreed to
undertake to appoint training consultants acceptable to the Bank and
appoint a Nigerian Training Manager, to succeed the current expatriate
AWS School Principal. Assistance in drafting terms of reference for the
consulting services would be provided by the Bank.

FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
BORNO STATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial Projections
A.  Maiduguri - Income Statement
1.   Water Produced
Water sales until 1983 have been derived from an estimate of
water produced and the assumption that unaccounted-for water
was approximately 50% of production. From 1984 through 1987,
production represents the maximum capacity of groundwater
sources. As from 1988, the treatment station for surface
water will allow for higher production in line with increasing
demand.
2.   Water Sold
A continuous decrease of unaccounter-for water from 50% to 30%
appears reasonably possible.
3. Average Revenue per ms
Increases in average revenue will for the next years mainly
result from more intensive metering of larger consumers rather
than from general tariff increases. Later, tariffs will have
to be adjusted in line with the finaaicial requirements of cost
recovery and surplus generating.
4.   Revenues
Other revenues consist of meter rents and connection fees.
Bad debt provisions should develop positively from 10% of
water sales in 1983 to 5% in 1987 and thereafter.
5.   Expenses
(i) Personnel, power, fuel and chemicals have been calculated
and annually inflated in line with operational
developments. The shift from ground to surface water
sources is reflected in a changed pattern of input
requirements from 1988. Maintenance is projected at 1.5%
the value of gross fixed assets in operation.

ANNEX 5-7
Page 2
(ii) The purchase of surface water from CBDA is based on a
charge per m3 of N.06 based on similar water sharing
agreements in Nigeria
(iii)  Overheads charged to M{aiduguri represent 1/3 of
managerial and administrative cost at headquarters,
including stock keeping. Present figures have been
increased by 20% p.a. until 1989 and by 10% p.a.
thereafter.
(iv) Depreciation of fixed assets has been projected at 3.5%
p.a. for the new Investments which will be revalued
annually by a weighted average of the domestic and
foreign cost inflation rates. Existing fixed assets,
consisting mainly of boreholes and their equipment, have
not been revalued because of their short life expectancy.
They have been depreciated by 5% p.a. until 1987. In
1988, when the surface water will substitute ground water
to a large extent, the 46 boreholes then to be closed
have to be written off completely from 1984 through 1988.
The remaining 23 are depreciated on the same basis as
that applied pre-1988.
(v)  For the projection of interest charges, it has been
assumed that BSG will finance the project by 50% equity
contribution and 50% loan, the latter at 10% p.a.
interest and a repayment period of 15 years, beginning in
1991. The next phase project starting in 1991 would be
financed by 75% loan and 25% own contributions.
6.   Income
Revenues would be sufficient to cover (a) recurrent cost by
1986 and (b) full cost in 1989. Achieving and maintaining a
rate of return of about 5% - 6% would be a desirable objective
of tariff policy.
B. Maiduguri - Balance Sheet and Funds Flow
1.   Balance Sheet
Fixed assets were properly identified and further developed as
projections. The gross value of the existing fixed assets was
treated as a Governiment grant, which diminishes by absorbing
the losses of the initial years. The build-up of capital as
equity begins with the inflow of project funds which are
supposed to be 50% loan and 50% equity. Stocks are considered
to be low, representing only material kept on the spot,
whereas stocks in the warehouses for the Board as a whole are
not reflected. Receivables are 35% of forecast net revenues.
Liabilities of about 70% of the Board's total current
liabilities are estimated to be incurred by Maiduguri
operations.

ANNEX 5-7

2.   Fund Flow Staten.ent
It has been assumed that the cash generation in Maiduguri
allows to finance as from 1992 annually about N3 million for
smaller investments in the city, mainly for replacements and
distribution extensions. Moreover, it is expected that the
Board will contribute 25% to the cost of the follow-up (second
phase) project, which will require about N10 million per year
over four years. Any surplus cash beyond these requirements
will help the Board finance investments in less profitable
areas of activities.
C.  Borno State - Income Statement
1.   Revenues
Figures for water production are not shown since the total
production in the hundreds of rural and smaller urban
settlements have never been properly recorded. Also most
vater supplies do not generate revenues. Therefore, only
income earning systems in the State's major towns have been
considered as a basis for water Bales. The average revenues
per m9 are supposed to be about the same as for Maiduguri,
increasing somewhat slower than in Iaiduguri in view of fewer
high paying non-domestic consumers.
2.   Expenses
(i  Chemicals, water purchase and interes represent the
Maiduguri figure.
(ii) The assumptions for other expenses are the same as for
Maiduguri, except that depreciation for existing fixed
assets has been assumed at 10% in view of their age and
their conditions.
3.   The non profitable operations for BSWB, mainly related to
rural water supplies, will require subsidies from the State
Government. These subsidies will depend on cash requirements
rather than on the results of the income statement. They
have, however, not been shown as operational subsidies, but
have been capitalized to demonstrate the slow but continuous
trend from losses to cost recovery and surplus generation
during the projected period.
D.  Borno State - Balance Sheet and Funds Flow
It has been assumed that the State will finance cash needs, in
addition to its project contributing to make up for operational
losses and for investments outside Maiduguri by means of
contributions towards equity, at the level of N17 million from 1984
through 1990, decreasing during this period.

BORNO STATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
NOTES ON THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
1. cost
Capital Cost
(M)     All costs are in 1983 prices and the analysis is performed assuming
a useful life of 45 years for the project as a whole.
(ii)    Elements of the treatment plant and distribution systems are
assumed to have a useful life of 10 - 15 years and equipment
including meters - 10 years, and replacement costs are included
accordingly.
(iii)   Total investment costs include also the construction cost of
the dam attributed to drinking water supply (N8 m in 1983 prices)
although the dam will be financed by FGN.
2. Project Incremental Production
This represents the incremental water production attributable
to the project. It is assumed that the groundwater production facilities
will gradually decrease in productivity.  In this Analysis the following
decreases are assumed:
1988    -    157
1989    -    30%
1990    -    45%
1991    -    60%
1992    -    75%
1993    -    90%
1994    -  *100%
Thus the project incremental productton includes also the quantities
otherwise not produced anymore by the existing facilities (the "without"
project scenario).
3. Water Produced by New Treatment Station
As it is assumed that by 1988 about 80% of the existing boreholes
would be switched to standby use. The new treatment station financed under
the project would thus start to produce immediately at a quite high level
filling in for the decommissioned boreholes. However, for the analysis of
the project the quantities produced by the new treatment station should not
be confounded with the "incremental productions" attributable to the project
which compares the "with" and "without" project cases.
