IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
BORNO STATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(LOAN NO. 2528-UNI)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Bomo State Water
Supply Project in Nigeria for which Loan 2528-UNI in an amount of US$72.0 million
was approved on May 7, 1985 and became effective on May 12, 1986. The loan was
closed on June 30, 1995.
This ICR was prepared by David Henley and Anton M. Rychener (Consultant) of
the Infrastructure and Urban Development Division, AF4IN. It was reviewed by Mr.
James Wright, Chief of the Infrastructure and Urban Development Division, and Mr.
Franz Kaps, Operations Adviser of the West Central Africa Department. It is based on
the President's Report, the Staff Appraisal Report, loan agreement, supervision reports,
and correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower and its agencies.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the last supervision mission of the
project which took place in June 95 and was carried out by Messrs. Henley and Okongwu
together with Mr. Rychener who was mostly responsible for data collection and
discussions with project as well as Bomo State Government officials. A number of
paying customers of the Borno State Water Corporation were also interviewed by the
mission and their opinion of the project and the services it renders to the community was
solicited. Their observations are contained in this report.  The Borrower's formal
evaluation is also appended to this report.

BORNO STATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(LOAN NO. 2528-UNI)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
As a result of years of unusually low rainfall in the seventies and a number of
years of severe drought - notably in 1973/74 and 1978/79 - in the sahelian zone - within
which Borno State is located, preparation of this project was begun in the early eighties.
As a consequence of the drought, a sizable part of the State's population lost its
livelihood, in what were marginal agricultural areas to begin with, and flocked to the
state's main urban area (its capital), Maiduguri, swelling its population in a period of a
few years from 400,000 to 670,000 by 1980. Up to 200,000 people were living in
makeshift housing at the outskirts of Maiduguri following the 1980 drought; in later years
most of this population went back to their farms and in 1995 Maiduguri's population was
estimated at 660,000.
This increase in the town's population put a strain on the aquifer - on which the
population relied for drinking water - which had already dropped by more than 7 meters
between 1975 and 1980. Such a rate of depletion, coupled with the anticipated further
increases in demands for drinking water, necessitated an alternative source to supplement
groundwater. Thus, the Borno State Water Board and the Chad Basin Development
Authority reached an understanding to share the waters of a nearby reservoir, Lake Alau,
that was under construction. The agreement called for equal use for town water supply
and irrigation of available surface water during average or better than normal rainfall
years, but to give priority to urban water supply in drought years.
At the same time the Borno State Government, on behalf of the Borno State Water
Board, requested Bank assistance to finance a treatment facility along with ancillary
works for the purification of water from Lake Alau for the town of Maiduguri.
Consequently, an identification mission visited Maiduguri in 1980, and in 1981 a
consultant was appointed by the Borno State Water Board to prepare a feasibility study
for the project. In 1981 and 1982, further Bank missions were undertaken to assess
progress of the study and help shape the project; the final report was submitted to the
Borno State Government and the Bank in 1983. The project was appraised by the Bank
in May 1983.
Project Objectives
Original objectives of the project were:



ii
(a)   to provide adequate and reliable supplies of safe water to Maiduguri from
the Lake Alau dam and reservoir;
(b)   to strengthen the Borno State Water Board by providing technical
assistance and training to enable it to undertake the orderly future
development and expansion of the state's water supply program, and its
efficient operation, and to help it towards financial viability; and
(c)   to provide the basis for effective sanitation in Maiduguri through studies to
be undertaken during project implementation.
Major legal covenants were (Loan Agreement): (a) funds to be onlent by the
borrower-the Federal Republic of Nigeria (FRN)- to Borno State Government (BSG) for
a period of 20 years with 5 years grace at an interest rate one half percent above the
Bank's lending rate; (b) the borrower to provide sufficient funds to construct Lake Alau
dam by June 30, 1986; and (c) Chad Basin Development Authority (CBDA) to provide
sufficient water to supply the needs of Borno State Water Board (BSWB); and (State
Agreement) (d) BSG to relend 80 percent of loan funds to the BSWB for the same period
and at the same interest rate as the loan agreement (covenant (a) above) and pass on 20
percent of the loan funds to BSWB as equity; and (e) BSG to provide in its annual
budgets sufficient funds to cover its contribution to project costs to be passed on to
BSWB as equity and to make provision to cover BSWB's operating losses.
The objectives as stated in the SAR were straightforward, albeit ambitious given
the weak institutional capacity of the BSG and BSWB. From the project's outset it was
clear that the only way to achieve them was to rely heavily on external technical
assistance. In contrast, given the glaring absence of BSWB capacity to manage its
existing water installations, consisting mainly of some 65 deep boreholes equipped with
pumps, a massive capacity building effort should have at least run concurrently with any
investment project. Instead the objectives mentioned training of staff seemingly as an
afterthought.
Implementation Experience and Results.
After a project implementation time that, for the treatment plant and the water
mains, the project's core, lasted almost twice the time foreseen (5 1/2 years versus 3 years
anticipated at appraisal), the project objectives have not been achieved. Not only were
they not achieved, but installations on the ground, if they work at all, are hardly
sustainable. From a technical point of view, key equipment is ill adapted to the
environment, making the entire water supply system unreliable. The valves on the water
pumps are prone to frequent brake-downs; at the time of the completion mission, barely
two years after commissioning of the plant, only one out of four was working. The
treatment plant itself is also designed for different climatic conditions; harsh winds and
temperatures put a heavy strain on some of the high-tech machinery, particularly the
chemical pumps and the electronically operated electrical switch panels. Although the



iii
water distribution network has been relatively well installed and on time, connections and
meters remain largely uncontrolled by BSWC and, as a result, unaccounted for water is
very high. While it was envisaged at appraisal that there would be 48,000 individual
connections and about 400 public standpipes at project completion in 1992; there were in
fact only 33,000 connections and 232 standpipes in mid 1995, sufficient to serve about
half of the current population, compared to an expectation at appraisal of perhaps 90
percent coverage.
The treatment plant was commissioned in early 1994 and in that year provided
drinking water for the first time to major segments of the population of Maiduguri.
However, in late 1994, owing to torrential rainfalls, a dike of the Lake Alau dam broke, in
the process flooding Maiduguri and completely depleting Lake Alau. As a result, the
treatment plant remained idle during the entire dry season of 1995. Thus, besides being
some three years behind schedule, efforts at launching systematic collection of water
charges in 1994 were undermined by the system's failure to reliably provide water over a
sustained period. BSWC's ability to collect enough revenue from the sale of water to
operate the system including payment of staff salaries, therefore, got off to a shaky start.
Moreover, BSG is no longer able to cover operating losses of BSWC (Section 2.02 {b}
BS Agreement). Last but not least, at completion there are many unanswered questions
regarding the affordability on the part of the larger portion of potential customers of
BSWC.
There were serious delays in procurement and installation of the treatment plant,
water towers, transmission main (raw water) and the transmission and distribution
systems and service connections. While there were no cost overruns in terms of total
costs, the foreign component was higher for all components except drilling rigs,
generators, vehicles, meters and technical assistance and training. For the latter two
components this was clearly due to lower than projected physical quantities; for the
others it most likely was due to the overvaluation of the Naira at appraisal. Similarly,
because of the longer construction time, at completion, the Supervising Engineer's
contract showed a cost overrun of the foreign portion of some 33 percent but in total
terms only 2 percent (Table 8). Savings were achieved by not constructing new
headquarters buildings and workshops. Of the US$72.0 million loan, US$3.4 million
were canceled in June 1993 and US$1.6 million remained undisbursed at completion.
This has since been cancelled. Although in the aggregate, BSG contributed all yearly
(local) costs to project financing, releases of funds (to contractors) were often late, which
contributed to implementation delays. BSG project cost financing in US$ terms was
about 65 percent below that projected at appraisal.
Political disturbances also delayed implementation. In 1990, the BSWB was
dissolved and the project agency became simply the Borno State Ministry of Water
Resources (BSMWR) without corporate structure. This decision was reversed in August
1991, BSMWR abolished and Bomo State Water Corporation (BSWC) founded. Worst
of all, the split-up of Bomo State in October 1991 - into Bomo and Yobe States - robbed



iv
the BSWC of both valuable personnel, and institutional and financial support as the
Federal Statutory Allocation was halved.
Summary of Findings - Key Lessons Learned
A major reason that stood in the way of the project achieving its objectives was
that BSWC personnel remain civil servants. On the engineering side, staff have been
trained under the project and are capable of maintaining installations; however, the
corporate side has been grossly neglected. Overall staff ability to act as corporate
employees, even though some of them possess the capacity, is constrained as civil service
rules continue to apply: no performance based promotions; no discretion of hiring and
firing; no clear policy on connection of new consumers; ability to turn off water
connections for lack of bill payment has been revoked by politicians. Civil service
salaries are so low that staff can barely survive. That in turn undermines morale and
renders staff unproductive and is, to a large extent, responsible for BSWC not having
collected water revenues exceeding 20 percent of operating costs in any of the past 10
years. The project's estimated rate of return at appraisal was based on a long-run marginal
cost of water resulting from the investment of N 43.2/m 3; this compares with BSWC
average current revenue of about N 8.0/mr3.
Bank supervision throughout the project has been regular (Table 13). Although
supervision reports consistently pointed out violations of loan covenants as well as other
shortcomings, follow-up was incomplete and without decisive action. The Borrower's
commitment to the project's long-range implications and, therefore, to take corrective
measures when needed, must be questioned not only at completion but also at the
preparation, appraisal and implementation stages. Moreover the frequent changes in BSG
and the resulting placement of four different General Managers and one Acting General
Manager of BSWC over the past nine years deprived the project of managerial continuity.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
BORNO STATE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(LOAN NO. 2528-UNI)
Part I. Project Implementation Assessment
1.   Introduction
1.1   After Enugu and Kaduna, Maiduguri was the third state capital in Nigeria to be
supported by a Bank loan for a water supply project. As a result of unusually low rainfall
in the seventies and a number of years of persistent drought - notably in 1973/74 and
1978/79 - in the sahelian zone within which Maiduguri is located, preparation of this
project was begun in the late seventies/early eighties. In a few years the city's population
swelled from 400,000 to 670,000 by 1980, as a consequence of the drought. People
previously occupied in agriculture lost their livelihood in marginal areas and had no
alternative but to migrate to town, which in turn put an even greater strain on
groundwater. As early as the 1960s it had been recognized that groundwater would no
longer be sufficient to meet water demand in Maiduguri past the mid-eighties. The water
level of the lower aquifer, the most productive in Maiduguri, dropped steadily in the
seventies by as much as 7 meters.
1.2   Following endorsement by the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) of BSG's
request for Bank assistance in the development of its state water sector plans, an
exploratory Bank mission visited Maiduguri in 1979. This was followed by an
identification mission in 1980 which advised the then BSWB - the parastatal agency
entrusted with statewide responsibility of water supply' - on the need for further project
preparation. In 1981, consultants were commissioned by BSWB to prepare a feasibility
study on the Maiduguri component of the identified, statewide project. In 1981 and 1982,
further Bank missions were undertaken to review progress of preparation and help shape
the project. The final feasibility study was submitted to BSG and the Bank in March
1983, and the project was appraised by the Bank in May 1983.
1.3   Borno State had not previously benefited from any foreign financed water
development project and, consequently, BSWB's capacity to manage a project of this size
was untested. Its staff of about 600 at the time of loan effectiveness were mostly civil
servants. Similarly, BSWVBs operating procedures were very much aligned to those of
state ministries with the singular difference that it kept its own accounts. But even those
were kept in accordance with state accounting procedures rather than corporate ones. Key
technical personnel were expatriates recruited under contracts.
Borno State Water Board was created by Edict No 7 of 1977 as a division of Borno State Ministry of
Natural Resources. In February 1980 it became independent in the sense that it kept its own accounts
and reported henceforth to the State's Military Governor.

2.    Statement and Evaluation of Project Objectives
2.1   The original objectives of the project were:
(a)   to provide adequate and reliable supplies of safe water to Maiduguri from
the Lake Alau dam and reservoir;
(b)   to strengthen the Borno State Water Board by providing technical
assistance and training to enable it to undertake the orderly future
development and expansion of the state's water supply program, and its
efficient operation, and to help it towards financial viability; and
(c)   to provide the basis for effective sanitation in Maiduguri through studies to
be undertaken during project implementation.
The project was composed of the following components:
(a)   construction of a raw water pumping station with three low lift pumps;
(b)   construction of a 67,000 m3/day treatment plant;
(c)   laying of approximately 200 km of transmission lines and distribution
pipes;
(d)   provision of eight generators to supply 100 percent of standby power to
operate facilities including existing borehole pumps;
(e)   operational facilities and equipment including HQ  buildings, zonal
workshops, chemical storage sheds, drilling rigs, vehicles, leak detection
and office equipment; and
(f)   provision of technical assistance, staff training and studies.
2.2   Objectives as defined in the SAR were straightforward, albeit ambitious. It is
doubtful that the designers fully understood the complexity, or perhaps the impossibility,
of trying to make a parastatal subjected to civil service rules efficiently operate a project
of this size.  No formal modification was made to the objectives during project
implementation, although sanitation studies were never commenced, and funding for
these studies was cancelled by the Bank in 1993. Although the BSWC's lack of capacity
to implement the project was clearly recognized at the outset, insufficient provision was
made to overcome this handicap which turned out to be the project's major shortcoming.
Throughout, there was too much reliance on external technical assistance to perform key
functions of project implementation.



-3 -
2.3  Implementation efforts were mainly devoted to achieving physical objectives: to
install the water treatment plant and distribution mains and network to provide drinking
water to the population of Maiduguri. The physical detachment of the project office from
BSWC's Headquarters is symbolic of the lack of focus and attention that was paid to
capacity building within the company that has to operate project installations. Indeed real
strengthening of BSWC could only have come through considerably more autonomy or
privatization of operations; payment of high salaries for the services of expatriate
technical assistance was a temporary substitute which was not sustainable over time. The
deletion of the sanitation study component of the project is a further consequence of the
emphasis on physical components of the project.
3.    Achievements of Objectives
3.1   During the seventies and early eighties, Borno State was an important center for
trades of all kinds in the three-state-corner of Nigeria, Cameroon and Chad. Merchandise
flowed freely not only in east-west direction but also north-south. During this time,
Maiduguri was prosperous, both from private sector trade and Government projects and
foreign and local contractors participated in what was a building boom. The project
objectives were developed by the State Government and the Bank in a setting where
financial resources were abundant. Both FGN and BSG realized that costly external
assistance was needed to manage an undertaking the size of the project. They felt
confident that, given continuous flow of oil revenue, they would be capable of financing
such assistance without having to rely on revenue from the sale of water generated by
BSWC.
3.2   Although warning signs abounded, be it the difficulty in getting vital supplies
over the long distance to Maiduguri (which is some 1,500 km from Apapa, Nigeria's
main port), the lack of trained, local manpower to manage the affairs of BSWB (during
project implementation 1/3 of the 67 boreholes were inoperative due to lack of
maintenance), or the shaky macro-economic situation of Nigeria, project activities were
launched on May 12, 19862 with great enthusiasm.
Main Contracts for Physical Installations
3.3   Prequalification notices were published on December 30, 1985, some four months
before loan effectiveness, for the major contracts under the project: (a) the water
treatment plant; (b) the new water tower and refurbishment of existing one; (c) the
transmission and distribution network; and (d) the raw water transmission line of 13 km
(from Lake Alau to the treatment plant). Some 200 contractors responded to the
prequalification invitation, and as a result of this large number, and consequently a great
deal of interest in influencing the outcome of the evaluation exercise, prequalification
was only completed in December of 1987. Final award of these four contracts and

mobilization did not happen until the end of 1988, some 18 months later than projected in
the appraisal report (this is best demonstrated in Table 4, Loan Disbursements.) In FY 88,
the actual disbursement as percentage of estimate was a mere 11 percent whereas in FY
89 and 90, respectively, this increased to 31 percent and 44 percent. Two factors
contributed to these delays: (a) political interference in the procurement process; and (b)
the slowness of release of counterpart funds for contract mobilization. Indeed, to partially
overcome the problem of slow counterpart fund payments, the BSG, by letter of June 27,
1988, asked, and the Bank agreed, to adjust the disbursement percentage for civil works
from 35 percent of total to "100 percent foreign exchange".
3.4.  Completion of contract No 1 (67,000 m3/day Water Treatment Plant) in August
1994 was close to five years behind schedule while contracts No 2 & 3 (water towers)
and 4A & 4B (distribution systems) suffered a two-year implementation delay. The
combined effect of these delays was postponement of provision of services to the
population of Maiduguri by some 4 years. The water reservoir at Lake Alau was ready
when the treatment plant finally became operational in 1994. At first the system worked
well and consumers were pleased. In fact, families interviewed in Maiduguri stated that
the availability of water in 1994, either through metered connections or through
standpipes in neighbourhoods, had the single biggest impact on their lives; women in
particular said that no longer do they have to walk long distances to fetch water.
However, they maintained that the cost of water is too high in relation to their incomes
and, in their view, provision of safe drinking water (at no cost to them) is the
responsibility of BSG, a view that is widely shared by the population including most civil
servants of BSG.
3.5   The project envisaged the number of service connections increasing from 20,000
to 48,000 during the implementation of the project (although financing was provided for
only 10,000 new connections), and public standpipes increasing from 254 to about 500.
In fact, at the end of the project, the number of connections stood at 33,000, and
standpipes at 232, resulting in population served being only about 317,000, rather than
the expected 542,000.
3.6   Lake Alau installations - the dam with spillgate, retention dikes and the raw water
transmission main - were completed on time by the Chad Basin Development Authority
(CBDA) and BSWC, respectively, although the project had to occasionally support
CBDA with equipment during construction. The reservoir is large and retains enough
water to provide for the population of Maiduguri. However, due to unusually heavy
rainfalls in the wet season of 1994, a retention dike was washed away and the reservoir
disgorged into the city, flooding in the process major sections of the town by as much as
5 feet. As a result, during the 1995 dry season between January and July, the reservoir
was empty and the water treatment plant had little or no raw water supply. BSWC in turn
could not provide all the town of Maiduguri with reliable drinking water and the only
source was once again the overstretched aquifer. By July 1995, the dike was repaired and

Corporate Strengthening of BSWC
3.7   The single most important objective, the strengthening of BSWC to enable it to
operate the physical installation, was not achieved by the project. If anything, in June
1995 BSWC was possibly weaker than BSWB at loan effectiveness in May 1986. As can
be seen from Table 8, estimated costs set aside at appraisal for technical assistance and
training activities were not fully utilized despite a project period that was three years
longer than projected.
3.8   Training was carried out on an ad hoc basis rather than according to a
comprehensive, well developed training agenda. Furthermore, as can be seen from Table
15- summary of training - in 1989, 1991 and 1993 there was virtually no training. These
years coincide with the periods in which BSWC underwent major upheavals:
transformation into the Ministry of Water Resources, split-up of the state and re-creation
of BSWC. Overseas training of management, professional and technical personnel was
mostly in the form of studies at large water utilities as well as courses in water
development offered by British water authorities. Local training chiefly consisted of
visits to other water utilities (Kaduna, Enugu) within Nigeria.
3.9   Towards the end of project implementation, during 1994/95, contracts were
awarded to foreign water authorities, one to operate the water production and distribution
facilities, and one to further develop the computerized billing and collection system.
Both of these contracts had large on-the-job training components. While this training
was effective to a certain extent, it did not achieve all that was intended due to it being
disrupted by political factors, curtailed by closure of the loan, and made less effective by
the absence of water to deliver during the 1995 dry season.
4.    Major Factors Affecting the Project
4.1   Project implementation was affected by three major factors, all of which were
clear and present at appraisal but were poorly understood: (a) macro-economic policy
(exchange rate); (b) unsatisfactory institutional arrangements; and (c) deteriorating
financial situation of State/Federal Governments.
Exchange Rate
4.2    Underlying the financial viability of the project were revenue projections from
water sales (SAR) in current Naira of the order of 159.0 million (US$13.8 million) in
1991 and 2.10 billion (US$25.1 million) in 1995. This level of revenue would provide for
operating and non-operating costs (principally depreciation and debt service) of project
installations including boreholes. Instead, 1991 revenue stood at N 2.5 million
(US$250,000), and 1995 revenue is expected to have reached only N 20.0 million
(US$250,000). Projections for 1991 and 1995 were based on average cost of water per m3
of N 10.5 (US$1.05) and N 112.0 (US$1.26), respectively. Instead, rates per m3 were N



-6-
0.7 (US$ 0.07) in 1991 and N 8.0 (US$0.09) at mid-1995. The steady erosion of the
purchasing power of the Naira has had a dramatic, negative effect on BSWC's finances as
well as proving demoralizing for personnel. The average monthly salary of an employee
of BSWB at the time of appraisal was about US$750 equivalent, a level that dropped to
about US$20 equivalent by project completion.
4.3   BSG's counterpart contributions to project costs, in current terms, fell short every
year of the project. Moreover, in strict accounting terms BSG is also in default of clause
2.02 (b) of the State Agreement, which provides for BSG to fully make up losses of the
utility including provision for depreciation. Up to the end of 1990 - when BSG finally
issued authorization for BSWC to independently revise tariffs - proposals for increases
had to be approved by BSG, a process that lasted up to 14 months. As a result, there have
only been three tariff adjustments since appraisal from an average tariff per m3 of N 0.2
(US$0.20) in 1986 to N 8.0 (US$0.10) in mid-1995, lower in 1995 in US$ terms than it
was in 1986.
Institutional Arrangements
4.4   Throughout project implementation the executing agency's status changed three
times: May 1986 - Nov. 1990 Bomo State Water Board, December 1990 - August 1991
Borno State Ministry of Water Resources and September 1991 onwards Borno State
Water Corporation. There are no 1989 and 1991 Balance Sheets and Profit and Loss
accounts for the utility, as 1990 was the year it reverted to Ministry status. In addition, in
October 1991 Bomo State was split into Bomo and Yobe States, a fact which decimated
BSWC's personnel. The General Manager of the utility was changed four times during
project implementation. All these events aggravated an already weak parastatal water
utility.
BSG Financial Situation
4.5   BSWC has been BSG's single biggest user of development budget resources. The
steady erosion over the past 10 years of state allocations (Federation Account) due to the
creation of 11 new states and related pressure on already overstretched feder al oil
revenues, made it increasingly difficult for BSG to meet its obligation under the State
Agreement. Whereas the SAR projected BSG's contribution to project costs at N 30.0
million, equivalent to US$43.0 million, actual, annual contributions were as indicated in
the table below. Although in Naira terms BSG contributed more than projected at
appraisal, N 160.36 million, this was equivalent to only US$14.7 million or 34.2 percent
of the projected dollar amount. Moreover, at completion by June 30, 1995 BSWC owed
some N 50.0 million (US$0.63 million) in counterpart funds to contractors.

5.    Sustainability
5.1   Sustainability of physical installations under the project is unlikely unless a
fundamental restructuring   of BSWC  is undertaken. Even with a restructuring
accompanied by privatization, questions with respect to affordability on the part of most
consumers will remain. Based on projections at appraisal, water tariffs per m  in 1995
should be around N 112.0 instead of N 8.0 as at present. With an average per capita
consumption per month of about 3 mi, water provided through connections would,
therefore, have to cost about N 336 per/month per family member. For a family of 5 this
would work out to over N 1,500, an amount that is close to 30 percent of the average civil
service salary of BSG. For standpipe customers, estimated consumption would be about
I m3 per month which would still work out to about N 560 per family per month, an
amount which is almost certainly beyond the means of the majority of Maiduguri's
inhabitants.
5.2    While the technical know-how to maintain facilities on the part of BSWC
engineers appears to exist, if the utility continues to operate as in the past, installations
will almost certainly stop functioning in the not too distant future as the sensitive
equipment is frequently braking down requiring a steady flow of spare parts. The lack of
resources to purchase spare parts, chemicals for water purification and fuel to keep the
plant running is of major concern to BSWC. As indicated in Table 14, revenue from the
sale of water by BSWC is currently so low that the utility is not even able to pay
personnel costs. The table below summarizes the development of revenue as percentage
of total operating costs over the project period:

Figures in N '000
5.3    As opposed to BSWC's 1995 operating costs of N 90.0 million (US$1.1 million
annually, adjusted), the SAR projects N 295.0 million (US$3.6 million), a figure which
possibly is much closer to what is actually required to keep project installations in good
order. If nothing else, this difference indicates how BSWC undertakes the bare minimum
of maintenance and virtually foregoes provision for depreciation. It also illustrates the
need for a comprehensive review of all of BSWC's operations, including a readjustment
in the book value of assets which as of December 31, 1994 were carried at N 573 million
(US$7.2 million) an amount that woefully understates the value of the Corporation's
assets. More than anything else, however, it demonstrates how far BSWC has to go
before tariffs that reflect the real cost per m3 of water can be set, and thus for the project
to eventually achieve sustainability.
6.    Bank Performance
6.1   Overall the Bank's performance in assisting BSG  with the identification,
preparation, appraisal and carrying out supervision of the project has been unsatisfactory.
During identification, preparation and appraisal, financing of investment in installations
to improve provision of drinking water to Maiduguri's population was overemphasized at
the expense of BSWC capacity building. It was only during the regularly carried out
supervision missions (Table 13), that Bank staff began to focus on capacity building. The
Bank and BSG underestimated the complexities involved in operating a water utility the
size of BSWC. In fact, in the Nigerian setting where the civil service still has a high level
of control, it may be impossible for a parastatal water utility to manage water treatment
and distribution facilities in a manner consistent with sound commercial principles and
sustainability.
6.2    Although supervision missions pointed out the need for corporate capacity
building - strengthening of the billing department in particular - and financial issues
early on, when there still would have been time to take corrective action, the Bank did not
recommend decisive changes. Another issue which should have been focused on more



9-
the water treatment plant's design weaknesses could have been avoided by timely
interventions.
7.    Borrower Performance
7.1   From the time the project was identified to its completion. the institutional
weakness of BSG and BSWC prevented both from decisively influencing the outcome of
events. Excessive reliance on the consulting engineers for physical implementation and
on external technical assistance for management of the utility, were key factors in the
failure to reach the project's objectives. In fact, BSWC is still so closely linked to BSG as
to be comparable to just another Ministry. This is best reflected by the fact that even
though BSWC possesses, de jure, the authority to set tariffs and to disconnect water for
non-paying customers, de facto it is BSG who makes these decisions. Accordingly.
repeated attempts by BSWC to increase tariffs to generate more revenue were scuttled by
politicians and decisions to cut-off service to non-paying. major BSG and FGN customers
(Police, Military, some 2,700 civil servants), were reversed.
7.2   On the other hand, project reporting throughout was excellent and information
flow was steady. Periods where information became scarcer occurred only when BSWB
was converted into the BSMWR and the State was split-up.
7.3   Perhaps the most damaging influence on BSWC. however, was the frequent
changes of Government (seven) and the abrupt replacements of the utility's General
Manager. It robbed the project of managerial continuity and BSG officials, at project
completion, were seemingly unaware of the poor state of the utility as BSWC
management always carefully ensured that high BSG officials were receiving
uninterrupted service.
8.    Assessment of Outcome
8.1   "Unsatisfactory' and most likely "unsustainable" under present conditions best
characterize the outcome of the project. Although physical installations to provide
Maiduguri's population with drinking water are in place, too many technical and
operational details are left unsolved for the project to stand on its own. Continuous
reliable supply of adequate and safe water from Lake Alau to Maiduguri is by no means
assured at this juncture. Neither is BSWC's capacity to efficiently operate the system.
Major shortcomings of the project are:
(a)   Failure to develop BSWC into a utility capable of managing the State's
water supply systems in an efficient manner and consistent with
commercial practices; and
(b)   Failure to deliver a technically and technologically adapted water
treatment facility capable of providing safe and reliable drinking water to
the population of Maiduguri.



- 10-
9.    Future Operations
9.1   Inasmuch as BSWC's revenue from water sales is currently insufficient to keep
the Maiduguri water supply system operative, a dated action plan was agreed upon in
June 1995 as per Appendix A - in order to improve the likelihood of sustainability of the
project. If BSWC complied with the action plan. it would be eligible under the National
Water Rehabilitation Project (NWRP-Loan No. 3322-UNI) for further financial support.
Key elements are:
* Implementation by June 30, 1995 of a routine preventive maintenance
program;
*  Implementation by July 31. 1995 of a thorough program  for control of
unaccounted for water including identification of illegal connections;
•  Preparation of a plan for additional technical assistance on an intermittent
basis, under NWRP, for financial and commercial operations;
-  Preparation not later than October 3 1, 1995 of a realistic plan for tariff
increases and efficiency improvements to enable cash operating expenditures
to be covered by the end of 1997; and
- A review of operation budgets and tariffs semi-annually.
To date, compliance with the action plan has been only partial, and no particular support
related to this project has been requested under NWRP.
9.2    Above all, however, the Bank should encourage BSG and BSWC to enter into
negotiations with interested private sector operators to participate in the operations of
BSWC. More efficient personnel motivated by private sector incentives, and systematic
tariff increases reflecting the real cost of water, may be the only chance for the project to
reach sustainability in the sense it was intended. The Bank continues to encourage
Bomo, and all other states of Nigeria, to introduce the participation of the private sector
into water supply operations, through continuing dialogue, and participation in seminars,
under the auspices of NWRP.
10.   Key Lessons Learned
10.1   Although provision of safe and reliable drinking water to Maiduguri's population
is an important undertaking, the question whether this was the right way to go about it
must be asked at project completion. A water utility in a city of 660,000 inhabitants with
some 33,000 connections and 23? standpipes through which an estimated total annual
production exceeding 20 million m ' is distributed, can never be successfully operated by



a corporation that is essentially subject to the civil service rules and regulations that
currently exist.
10.2   The key lesson doubtless remains that it does not suffice to construct physical
facilities for provision of water; of equal importance - if not more so - is to develop the
institutional capacitv of the water utility and to provide it with the necessary
independence to successfully operate and maintain physical installations. For if such
capacity does not exist, as is the case with the Bomo State Water Corporation, expensive
installations will rapidly deteriorate and customers will become disillusioned. Allied to
this, is the need for the institution to be able to develop a realistic policy for connection of
consumers to the system, and a charging policy, in order to enhance revenue, serve the
maximum number of people, and maintain affordability.
10.3   Care must be given to assessing affordability questions; it may well be that in the
immediate future most customers will not possess enough purchasing power to pay for
water at its real cost, although at appraisal it appeared that they would be able to do so.
This situation may someday improve and there is little question that the majority of
people are willing to pay for safe, reliable drinking water, however their ability to do so
will depend on macro-economic conditions unrelated to the project. A key lesson is that
macro-economic conditions can deteriorate rapidly through earlier unforseen
circumstances, jeopardizing the sustainability of a project.

APPENDIX A
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
BORNO WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (LN 2528-UNI)
WORLD BANK MISSION AIDE MEMOIRE: JUNE 1995
1.    This aidememoire sunmmarizes the discussions and agreements reached during a mission
by David Henley and Eugene Okongwu between June 12 and June 16, 1995, this being the final
supervision and implementation completion mission. The mission held discussions with the
Secretary to the State Government, Director General of Parastatals, General Manager (Engr. M.
K. Gubio), staff, consultants and contractors of the Bomo State Water Corporation (BSWC), and
the Managing Director of the Chad Basin Development Authority (Engr. B. G. Zanna). This
mission followed on from a mission the previous week during which Anton Reichener had initiated
the preparation of the Implementation Completion Report.
2.     The mission acknowledges the several pleas it received to further extend the Loan closing
date beyond June 30, 1995, but explained that current policies would not permit this. The mission
would also like to acknowledge the cooperation and hospitality offered by the General Manager of
BSWC and the Project Management Office.
Project Implementation
3.     Physical implementation of the project has been essentially completed, and delivery of
water commenced in April 1993 with considerable benefit to Maiduguri. Operation of the raw
water pumping station and the water treatment plant/high lift pumps (WTP) was undertaken by the
contractors up to August 1994, at which time BSWC assumed the responsibility for operation.
While most of the project was handed over at that time or earlier, an extensive defects list for the
WTP was prepared and many items are still not fully corrected. The mission felt that some of the
stated defects were in fact design faults, or had resulted from design inadequacies or the present
unusual operational conditions (para 9.), however it encouraged BSWC and the contractor to reach
a pragmatic agreement to have those outstanding defects for which the contractor is responsible
corrected. It is essential that this be finalized in time to allow the outstanding payment to be made
to the contractor before October 31, 1995, the final date for payments under the loan.
4.     Spare parts sufficient for two years operation were to have been supplied under the WTP
contract, however the list of parts approved by the consultants proved to be quite inadequate, In
addition, numerous items of equipment are required to correct design faults and omissions. The
Bank has previously given no objection to the purchase of additio'nal spares and other necessary
items under the loan, totaling about US$ I million in value, however it will not be possible for these
to be delivered before the loan closing date, and hence they will not be procured under the loan _
The mission recommended that BSWC review their purchase list with view to possible reduction,
and consider procurement under the National Water Rehabilitation Project (NWRP). This will
require the reduction in scope of work for one contract already awarded under NWRP to mnake
necessary savings.
5.     Technical assistance in plant and system operation and maintenance, and in workshop
operations, is being given by Thames Water and Ortech respectively. Both of these will continue
up to June 30, 1995, and both report considerable development of BSWC staff to a point where
they can satisfactorily undertake their duties and further train new recruits. However the number
of personnel available for three-shift operation is inadequate. Regardless of the number and
abilities of the'staff, thep'resent lack of spares will lead to complete shut down of the plant within



months if not corrected. BSWC has considered the option of having private sector maintenance of
parts of its facilities however the response has not been encouraging so far because of private
sector concerns about BSWC's ability to pay under their present circumstances.
6.     Technical assistance for commercial operations including computerized billing is being
given by Amsterdam Water/BMB, extending up to June 30, 1995. While considerable progress
has been made,-there are still hardware, software and operational difficulties, and it is unclear
whether this operation is sustainable without further assistance. The financial expert also
concludes his duties on June 30, 1995; he reports that considerable progress has been made and
several qualified staff are available. The mission recommended that BSWC seriously consider
utilizing funds from their component of the NWRP (from which funds have been reserved for
institutional support) for extending the assistance noted under this and the previous paragraph,
probably on an intermittent basis.
Commercial Operations
7.     The commnercial operations of BSWC have suffered dramatically during the year, because
of the dyke failure at Alau dam last September (para 9.). Although collections increased steadily
over the last three years, and reached an all time high ofN 1.3 million in March 1995, they
subsequently dropped to almost nothing as water became unavailable. During 1994, about 60% of
water produced was unaccounted for, since there are many illegal connections and many consumers
have duplicate connections, only one of which is metered. Collection is only about 40% of billings.
It is imperative that BSWC address these issues urgently when water becomes available again, and
with the loss reduction assistance that is being given under NWRP.
8.     BSWC has estimated that N5 to N6 million revenue is required per month to cover cash
operating costs, including the regular supply of spare parts. Capital recovery costs could be an
order of magnitude higher. Regardless of the question of capital cost recovery, if the project is to
be even marginally sustainable, revenue must be increased dramatically and the question of supply
of spare parts on a long term basis needs to be addressed, so that parts can be readily imported as
necessary. BSWC should address the issue of import of spare parts financed by their own funds to
identify processing constraints and streamline procedures.
Alau Dam
9.    In September 1994, one of the dykes (saddle dams) at Alau failed, apparently by
overtopping, causing severe flooding of Maiduguri, and causing the loss of most of the storage
capacity of Alau reservoir. As:a result, almost no water has been available from this source since
about March, and Maiduguri has had to revert to its old inadequate groundwater source. Apart
from the obvious distress of water shortage, this has caused it to be impossible for proper
assistance and training to be given by Thames Water for Water Treatment Plant operations, and
has resulted in many consumers removing their meter to extract what little water is available from
the distribution pipelines. This will require a major effort to correct when water again becomes
available during the coming wet season.
10.    The need for further measures at Alau to retain water during the coming wet season was
discussed by the mission with BSWC and the Chad Basin Development Authority (CBDA), owner
of Alau Dam. CBDA has invited bids for replacement of the failed dyke, and raising and
strengthening the other dykes, but this Will not be concluded until next dry season. Meanwhile a



temporary low level dyke has been constructed near the failure site to impound sufficient water for
next dry season. Overtopping would be prevented by proper operation of the gates at the main
dam. The mission was unable to judge the soundness of this structure, but was assured by CBDA
that it would withstand the forces which it would be subjected to. Although there is some risk
associated with the temporary dyke, there seems little other choice for the comning wet season.
BSWC agreed over the next few weeks to reduce permeability of this dyke by constructing a clay
blanket on the upstream side of the dyke, to provide stone pitching to prevent erosion, and to flatten
the downstream slope. This would be financed under existing contract 5A. BSWC agreed to liaise
closely with CBDA on this matter.
Implementation Completion Report
11.    BSWC confirmed that the project statistical information previously requested had been
provided to Mr Reichener. The mission explained that the Implementation Completion Report
(ICR) should contain an appendix prepared by BSWC to indicate their perceptions of the project,
its achievements, its shortcomings, and the performance of itself and the Borrower, contractors,
consultants, and the Bank. The mission indidated to BSWC the Bank's requirements concerning
the details of BSWC's component of the ICR. BSWC agreed that this would be finalized before
September 30, 1995, but provided an initial draft to the mission (Attachment 1).
12.    Considerable discussion took place concerning the future actions required by BSWC to
operate the water supply and render the project sustainable, as indicated above- The outcome of
this is summarized in the operational action plan at Attachment 2.
Finalization of Project Accounts
13.    BSWC indicated that it would be able to finalize all project accounts well before the cut-
off date of October 31, 1995, using the project management office. This is necessary since the
consulting engineer had ceased his services as from April 1995 due to a contractual dispute with
BSWC. Since that time, Thames Water and Ortech had been assisting BSWC with wrapping up
the main outstanding construction contract, that for the WTP (refer para 3.).
14.    Concerning payments under the consultant's contract, the mission suggested that BSWC
should make payments in accordance with the terms of the contract. Though there had been
differences between the consultant and BSWC, these should' not be grounds for arbitrary
reductions in the amount payable unless there was full documentation of any fhilure by the_.
consultant, and justification for any reduction proposed. The missionco6otuded that,thetwrn's`of  .' 
the contract regarding payment were clear, and included a percentage of final executed co0t of
contracts (including escalation) for (i) general supervision and (ii) as a lump sum for
reimbursables. BSWC agreed to provide the Bank with final contract valuations for review by
early July.

Audit
15.   BSWC advised the mission that the audit of 1994 accounts was completed and only
required the auditor's final signature. BSWC agreed to send the audit to the Bank before June 30,
1995.

Attachment I
BORNO WATER SUPPLY PROJECT - LN 2528 UNI
Maiduguri Water Supply Project
SiLtuation Repowt by            Date: 14 Jume 1995
Engr. 1M. K. Gubio, General lfanager
Borno State Water C0rporat3WM
Basically the physical structures necessary for the operations
and achievement of the utilisation of surface water scheme has been
successfully put in place. As the main objective of the project is
to process and treat raw water of the Alau dam for the daily water
requirement of Maiduguri, the Capital of Borno State of Nigeria,
this objective has been met by putting' the plant under test-running
since the - middle. of 1993 to date. The project was completed at a
time when the alternative source of water supply to Maiduguri is
almost exhausted due to; over-extraction of the aquifers by the
increasing number of boreholes. With the new scheme in place
the standard of living and the livelihood of the inhabitants have
improved tremendously, because the plant is producing four times
the quantity of water been  supplied by the boreholes even at 60%
operation capacity. In view of this admittance by the beneficiaries
one can say that the prospects for the project sustainability is
very bright and hopeful.;
The lack of raw water from the AJau dam which was caused
by the failure of one of the dykes created acute wV!Ershortage
in Maiduguri for some few moz'ths. Something which they have
forgotten since the water treatment plant was put under test in
1993. This situation brought to the minds of the populance
the importance of this project.



-2-
The Bank's consistent visits and assessment of the project
at various stages have enhance the completion of the project
successfully. The Corporation need not to mention several auidance
and recommendations of the Bank officials bring the project to a
successful end with various contracts and contractors.  Not only
was the Bank helpful in the execution of the Maiduguri Water
Supply Project but it has assisted the Corporation in number of
ways to keep the Corporation operational e.g. training given to
staff, purchase of necessary machineries and equipments for
boreholes drilling and maintenance of same, setting of a computer
unit to enhance our billing system and. accounting and financial
discipline. All these were possible due to understanding and the
cooperation accorded by the Bank Supervision Mission from time
to time.
The Corporation and the State Government on the other hand
were able to understand the Bank's procedures and adv-ices, policies
for the actualisation of this project. Towards this, the Government
gave priority to this project to make sure that counterpart contri-
bution requirements were met regularly to complete the constructi6n
works. gecondly the State Government also gave the Corporation
the necessary authortative independence to decide on its operationaI
methods and determining of water rate as the prices of other
essential commodities changes e.g fuel, power and labour._
The project set-up although new to the Corporation but a
number of similar projects were executed in other states of the
federation which are functioning successfully. Already visits were
made to existing similar projects to determine the problems encountered
during the operational stage. With these additional information



-3-
received and the experience encountered from the mid of 1993
to date, the Corporation being an autonomous body plans to set-
up its own budgets independently. Projections will be made on
the generated revenue from the sales of water to meet the
operational and maintenance cost.
With impioved billing and collection system, even the 60%
production level so far reached, can generate enough funds for
the operational cost at the rate of N8.0O per cubic metre of
treated water. Water price adjustment can be made to consider
the loan re-payment. The Corporation does not anticipate operational
problems in the long term-if certain corrective measures can be
taken now for a smooth take-up of the system. The initial
lapses in the operation is due to design which was not rectified
by the designed engineer                     who also supervised
the project
Almost on all, the major contracts under the project, design
problems were encountered right from the project inception. Some
corrections to actualise the designs were made with the assistance
of some of the contractors who handled the contract executions.
For example, the Elevated Water Tower was completely re-designed
when the initial designers could not carry out necessary corrections
and explanation came at the construction stage. M/S Alfred MacApline
of UK the contractor of the eleevated water tower helped in
actualisation of the structure. Secondly M/S PWT also made a lot
of changes which the Consultants couild not do when called upon
to execute.
Still there are some outstanding issues not yet attended to



-4-
which will hinder the smooth take up of the project among these
are: -
(a)  The clarifiers almost developed problem when the raw
water quality changes - which means the Consultants
did not carry out any investigation on the raw water
quality at various periods of the year.
(b)  The pressure control valves designed were faulty and
already three out of the six high lift pumps are not
functioning.
(c)  The sludge lagoons as designed and supervised by the
Consultant have never function and no necessary recti-
fication given by the Consultant.
(d)  A lot of electro-mechanical problems were encountered
during the test running which are not yet resolved.
In fact, if not because of the presence of MIS Thames
Water International and a Mechanical Engineer from
M/S Ortech the operation of the plant couldc have been
halted.
(e)  Another problem area apart from the plant is the disfri-
bution network systems. This we have asked M/S Tahal
Consultants who are designing the second phase of the
.   :,     ;. ..Maiduguri Water Supply Project to look ir;to' ways. of,
improvement.       -
(f'  Prwcurement of necessary spareparts could not be analysed
by the Consultants and now the spareparts even for the
take up of the system is not available.
Throughout the project implementation period, a number of
mistakes and omission by the Consultants have been observed
by the Client's project supervising staff and there also have been  .'
pointed out to the Bank.



Finally, I will like to point out in the interest of the beneficiaries
and the Bank who have invested millions of dollars, that the Bank
needs to make the necessary corrections before handing over the
responsibility of operation and maintenance of such a laudable
project. If the Bank can appoint another Consultant to carryout
some studies of the various aspects mentioned above, the Corporation
will be highly delighted. Certain financial assistance to make
rectification on the highlift pumps, chlorine room, generator etc
are quite necessary.
Attached is details of other deficiencies in addition to the
few mentioned ones.

MAID UGUIRI WATER SUPPLY PROJECT DESIGN & SUPERVISION d
- DEFICIENCIES OBSERVED
411'      ' 
1. 1 ' Generators in RWPS & WTP are overdesigned. Longer operaton
of the generators is not feasible as this wUill result in frequent
overhauling. Operation cost, particularly consumption of diesel
at 200 litres/hour is too high (fomments Mr. Gait, TWI, WEIR
Pumps).
2.     Sludge lagoon is not operating due to defective design
(Comments TWI/PWT/PCI)I.
3.     The crane in the power house is of 2.5T capacity whereas
the alternator weight is 5T.  (Comments Nfr. GLit/TWI).
4 .    The crane in the chlorine bu Iding, is of 1.5 Eonnes capacity
whereas the weight of chlorine dr'um incIuding gas is 1.6 tonnes.
(Comments Mr. Gait/T;I).
' f 5. ' No provision for lifting of backwash pump if it needs repair.
'    '((Comment Mr. Gait)
6.     The treated water pump control valve is of complex type,.and
this kind of valve is not used even in sophisticated plants.
T;he valves cannot funcvom and need firnate repLa-mt (CcDnmt PWT)
7.     The motor control for chemical dosing pumps with IC card
could have been avoided. TWI has now converted them into
simpler system. (Comment TWI)
8.  In final migineer-1-                      SiI. 
8.     In final eingineer ....design, the system has been designed' over-
looking the unaccounted w4at(rF1bout 0% and as a result
-     the peak water demand cannot be tak'en care. (Comment TAHAL)
After bid opening for the water treatment plant contract, the
following corrections in   , design were done as per BSWC's
earlier observations folowed by criticisms of the design received
from sub-contractors PCI, SULZER, DECROMONT:
-  Change of clarifier design by PWT/PCI...



2
-  Introduction of a pump for backwashing of filters
(in original design neither backwash pump nor any
overhead tank was provided).
-  Some changes in chemical dosing system.
10.    Neutralization of chlorine gas in case of an accident by the scrubber
system is complicated.  Even modern water works in Europe use
water sprinkling device which is much simpler and cheaper.
(Comment SULZER)
11.    Introduction of drainage ponds in the treatment plant area wh'e
the ground is fully sandy is an awful design. BSWC will require
every year huge sum of money to backfill, compact and protect th.kZ
slopes. The erosion of the drainage ponds in some places is
threatening the existance of the internal-roads.
12.    It was discovered from the comments 'of Alfred McAlpine who was
awarded the contract for the construction of Water Tower that the
design of tank supported by,4a cqnta -shaft is an.. imaginery
structure.  Without peripherial columns the structure is not
feasible. The above was accepted by tAe  designer
and changes were made with supporting columns after signing
of the agreement.
13.    DAR's supervision team's and their headquarters' interpretation
of payment of provisional sums and fluctuated costs of basic rate
items using tender date exchange rate has caused huge financial
loss to BSWC. For the same contract conditions, they         have
interpreted the payment of fluctuated costs in favour of the client
(Lagos State Drainage Division) recommending payment of foreign
currency using the prevailing exchange rates.
14.    Quality of general supervision was poor all through and the super-
vision team had always a tenderncy to over-certify the contractors'
° * *  payment certificates.

BORNO STATE WATER COPRPORATION (BSWC)
BORNO WATER SUPPLY PROJECT   LN 2528 UNI
Implementation Completion Report
INTRODUCTION
1.1      With the rapid depletion of the underground water in Borno State
due to severe drought in the seventies and early eighties, the
then Borno State Water Board (BSWB) decided to look for alternative
source of water for the population of Maiduguri. The boreholes
could no longer meet the increased demand of water by the
inhabitants whose population has increased by more than fifty
percent as a result of migration by farmers who lost their farming
jobs due to droughts.
1.2      In April 1975, consultants were commissioned by Federal Ministry
of Agriculture and Natural Resources to study Ngadda stream flow
at lake Alau. The study was principally for irrigation of Jere
Bowl areas North-east of Maiduguri and also for Maiduguri Urban
Water Supply, and was initially taken up by the State Ministry of
Natural Resources. Chad Basin and Rural Development Authority
later on took over the responsibility of the study. Emphasis
was given for the water to be shared for both the irrigation
and water supply to Maiduguri.
1.3      Borno State Government approached the World Bank for assistance
in the area of provision of portable water to the populace
of Maiduguri by purifying the impounded water at Lake Alau. Terms
of reference for comprehensive Maiduguri Water Supply Scheme
was prepared and consultants were commissioned in January 1981 to
carry out the feasibility studies of Maiduguri Water Supply.
The same consultants were commissioned in March 1983 to carry
out the engineering design and preparation of tender and contract
documents. Report on the feasibility studies was finally
submitted to Borno State Water Board and the World Bank in 1983.
The project was subsequen' ly appraised in May 1983. The loan
was finally signed in FeL iary 1986.



2
2.       PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND ACHEVEMENTS
2.1      PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The project was conceived with the following major objectives:
(a)    To provide necessary installations for provision of
adequate and reliable drinking water to the populace
of Maiduguri.
(b)    To provide technical assistance and training with
the view to strengthen the Borno State Water Board
in terms of future development including efficient
operation of the existing system.
For the achievement of the above objectives, the project was
broken into three main components:
(i)    Construction and installation of water treatment
facilities consisting of raw water pumping station with
three low-lift pumps and transmission line, water treat-
ment plant with capacity 67,000m3/day and laying of
distribution pipes as well as installation of 26,500
service connections.
(ii)   Operational facilities and equipment including vehicles,
water tankers. rigs, leak detection equipment, trucks,
computer hard and soft wares, generators, submersible
pumps, motorcycles and office equipment.
(iii) Provision of technical assistance and training of staff
including consultancy services.
2.2      ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
The greatest achievement fo the project is the successful com-
pletion of the main physical installations necessary for the
supply of safe drinking water to Maiduguri. The water treatment
plant with its installations and accessories was completed and
put into use since August 1994. The raw water pumping station
with the raw water transmission line was also completed and
commissioned in 1994. About 250km distribution pipe and



3
26,500 numbers of metered house connections as well as about
230 numbers of stand pipes were constructed and commissioned.
2.2.1    Under the technical assistance and training, quite a number of
Borno State Water Corporation's professional and technical
personnel undertook various courses locally and overseas with
the view of strengthening BSWC's ability to manage and maintain
its facilities. Some techncial staff were also attached to
other State Water Agencies with the country to improve their
skills in operation and maincenance of water installations.
2.2.2    In 1994, a technical institution in Onitsha, Nigeria offered
some practical lessions to BSWC's electrical, mechanical and
instrumentation personnel. On-the-job training was offered
by Thames Water International of U.K. but only for 6 months
out of the 24 months programme. The programme was terminated
due to the closure of the loan which deprived BSWC from getting
its staff trained on the new installations. Reorganisation of
Borno State Water Corporation's central workshop as well as
training of its workshop personnel was carried out for the period
of 24 months by Ortech Consulting Engineers. However, the training
was not effectively carried out as desired. This is due to late
arrival of necessary workshop tools and equipment ordered from
Inter-Agency Procurement Services Office (IAPSO). Technical
Assistance period of Ortech is required to be extended to enable
BSWC's personnel get enough training on the use of the newly
acquired tools and equipment. The Consultants will also
coordinate the electrical and mechanical maintenance of the
installation of water treatment plant and alau pumping station
with a view to make BSWC's engineers adequately maintain the
installation.
2.2.3    Another achievement of the project is the improvement of operational
capability of BSWC in terms of provision of basic operational
materials.  These include the procurement of vehicles,  cranes,
rigs, water tar':ers, submersible pumps, generators, etc for
improving water supply to consumers; supply and installation of
computer soft and hard wares for computerisation of billing system;
rehabilitation and furnishing of existing headquarters building
of BSWC, etc.

3.       FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
3.1      There are two main factors that affected the smooth execution of
the Project. These are frequent changes and instability in the
value of Naira, and the slow and inconsistent release of counterpart
fund by the State Government. The decline in the purchasing power
of the Naira contributed to continuous upward review of contract
costs. Delays in the execution of some aspects of work as a
result of contractors difficulty in timely clearing of imported
goods were encountered. This is mainly due to cash flow constraints
in accommodating the increase in import duties arising from changes
in exchange rates. The release of counterpart funds by the State
Government was sometimes steady and sometimes irregular. This can
be explained from the fall in the statutory allocation to the
State Government by the Federal Government. The State Government
was also faced with numerous commitments in other state establish-
ments, yet the Project enjoyed the priority attention throughout
its period.
4.       OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCE
4.1      Following the initial commission of the water treatment plant
and raw water pumping station, a number of problems were encountered.
These problem are mainly attributed to design problems as highlighted
in the attachments to the June 1995 Supervision Aide-memoire. The
5 MVA transformer at Alau pumping station has very small voltage
tapping range. It could not take care of all the voltage
fluctuations from NEPA as a result serious overvoltage and
undervoltage were experienced which will not allow pumps to be
run at times.
4.2      The sizes of the generators both at water treatment and Alau
pumping station are such that they could not be operated under
light loads. As the main loads at both locations are the water
lifting pump;, the generators are not operated when pumping is
not require or when low pumping is desired. Small generators
are now installed to provide power to the light loads when
NEPA power is not available. The bigger generators are therefore
used when maximum pumping is required.



5
4.3      Frequent faults were noticed with the electronically controlled
chemical dosing pump panels. The electronic cards fails. An
alternative solution are being adopted by eliminating the cards
and replacing them with Direct-On-Line (DOL) starters. This
arrangement was experimented and found to be efficient. Arrange-
ments are being made by BSWC engineers to re-wire the remaining
panels (total number of panels are eight).
4.4      Problems were encountered with the operation of the high lift
pumping station in the water treatment plant. The type of control
valves (Bi-water valves) installed require frequent servicing.
The seals of the valve are very delicate and difficult to maintain.
When the valves fail it require some manouvres to operate them.
Plans are underway to replace the valves with simpler set-up. This
is being done by BSWC engineers and Ortech Consulting Engineers
(BSWC's technical assistance consultants). Funds are made available
under the National Water Rehabilitation Project (NWRP).
4.5      The sludge lagoon could not be effectively operated.  This is also
part of design/supervision problem as mentioned in the aLtachment
of June 1995 aide-memoire. Arrangement to re-route the sludge from
the clarifiers to the drain is being made. This will help in
recycling the wash water from filters back to the inlet.
4.6      In September 1994, both the water treatment plant and raw water
pumping station worked below capacity due to the draining of the
lake Alau reservoir after one of its dykes failed. A temporary
dyke is now being construected and found to be strong enough to
retain the volume of wat r in the dam. The water level is maintained
at 328 (1 meter below the highest crest level of the dam)
throughout the last season. The treatment plant is back in full
operation since. Contract is awarded by the Federal Ministry of
Water Resources to M/S Impresit Bakalori for the construction
of permanent dyke.
5.       SUSTAINABILITY
5.1      The major requirement for the effective running of the water
treatment plant are the water treatment chemicals, fuel and lubricants
for the stand-by generators, electricity from NEPA and some spares



6
for the equipment. Avera;e monthly requirement is estimated at
N5.Om. This exludes the major spare parts. An arrangement is
being made to procure essential spare parts using the National
Water Rehabilitation Project funds. This spares are believed
to last for a minimum of three years. Presently the State Government
provides about 70 percent of the running cost while the remaining
is sourced from revenue generated from water sales. The current
revenue generation of BSWC stands at N1.8m/month. Water rates
for all categories of consumers was increased in January 1996.
With the new rates BSWC targets about N3m /month. This will greatly
reduce over dependance on the State Government on operating and
maintaining the installations.
6.       DESIGN FOR PHASE II WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
6.1      From the feasibility study and final engineering design prepared
by Dar Al-Handasah Consultants in 1983/84 Maiduguri town was divided
into five zones. The central parts of the town which are densely
populated were termed as zones 1 and 2, while the outskirts of the
town as zones 3, 4 and 5. The water supply was designed to be
implemented in two stages:
Stage I  -  1992, population 534,000, water production 67,000m3/day
State II - 2005, population 850,000, water production 134,000m3/day
The daily water production of 67,OOCm3/day in stage I was allocated
for all the zones of Maiduguri, out of which some 60% were allocated
for zones L and 2 and 40% for zones 3, 4 and 5. The water supply
for zone I and 2 (major parts of the city) was afterwards implemented
in Phase I.
6.2      Tahal Consultants (Nig) Ltd was commissioned in 1994 to plan and
prepare detailed designs of the water supply system to zones 3, 4
and 5 for stage I, detailed design for the distribution network
for zones 3, 4 and 5 for stage II and to prepare tender documents
for Phase II of stage I for water supply system and distribution
netT rk for zoe.  , 4 and 5.
6.3      In      final design report submitted by Tahal Consultants, it was
dis. vered that the population of Maiduguri has increased considerable
sir,  the previous design report was issued in 1984.  The annual



7
rate of gr h is estimated to be 5% against the 3.5% as was
envisaged earlier. The stage II population level will be reached
by the year ,000 instead of the year 2005.  Therefore, the
Consultants concluded that the current water production capacity
of  ;_age I, (67,000m3/day) constructed in 1992 is too low for
the current water demands. After the implementation of the dis-
tribution system for zones 3, 4 and 5, acute water shortage
will be felt in the city.
6.4      The Consultants recommended that the preparation of the detailed
design of stage II of Maiduguri Water Supply system which include
mainly doubling the capacity of the water supply system to be
carried out immediately.
