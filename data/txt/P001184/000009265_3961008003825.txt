MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
FOR A PRIVATE SECTOR ENERGY PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire for SDR 50.6 million, the equivalent of
US$79.66 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years including a ten year grace
period, to help finance a project for power sector reform (including tariff and regulatory program
development), power generation expansion through a private power producer and power system
reinforcement works. Part of the proceeds of the Credit (US$50 million equivalent) would be onlent
to CIPREL for Phase II power generators for 17 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at
8 percent per annum. The remainder of the Credit (US$29.66 million equivalent) would remain
with the Government of C6te d'Ivoire to finance the Complementary Sector Investments and the
Institutional Building Components of the project. Private equity and multilateral commercial debt
financed CIPREL Phase I power generators, now commissioned.
2.     Country Economic Background. Since the early 1980s, C6te d'Ivoire has faced several
fiscal and balance of payment crises. These reflected both inadequate macroeconomic policies and
more fundamental distortions in the Government's policies relating to pricing, trade, finance, and
the public sector. These distortions adversely affected efficient allocation of resources, and
constrained sectoral growth prospects. The Government adopted various stabilization, structural
and sectoral adjustment programs (of which the Energy Sector Adjustment Loan (ESAL) in 1989)
supported by the IMF and the Bank, to correct its macroeconomic imbalances and increasing
international competitiveness through a policy of internal adjustment. In 1991, the Government
adopted a medium term economic framework (MTF) which spelled out structural reforms aimed at
restoring international competitiveness, returning to the effective exchange rate pertaining in 1985
and to a path of sustainable growth. This was accompanied by tight fiscal and monetary policies,
reforms in the areas of trade and finance, a privatization process involving about 50 enterprises,
and a program to support human resource development. The reform program was supported by
three SECALs which were accompanied by a stand-by arrangement with the IMF. In addition, the
Bank approved technical assistance credits to support the Government in implementing its
economic reforms, privatization program, and human resources development program. Despite
progress in implementing key parts of this economic program, the Ivorian economy continued to
suffer from substantial fiscal and balance of payments imbalances, and considerable structural
rigidities. Faced with this difficult situation, the Government, in close consultation with its CFA
franc partners, decided on January 12, 1994 to complement its strategy of internal adjustment with
a realignment of the parity of the CFA franc, from 50 to 100 CFA franc per French franc (FF).
3.    With the realignment of the CFA franc, the Government has revised its medium term
adjustment program in a Policy Framework Paper (PFP) which has been updated to cover the
1995-97 period. The PFP aims to: (i) raise the rate of economic growth, (ii) achieve primary
surpluses in the Government's budget, (iii) strengthen external competitiveness through trade,
price, and regulatory reform, (iv) seek debt relief from official bilateral and commercial creditors at
concessional terms, and (v) intensify human resource development and poverty alleviation
measures with a view to protecting the most vulnerable groups during the adjustment period. The
realignment of the CFA franc will provide added impetus to structural reforms the Government has



- 2 -
been undertaking over the last several years. With regard to trade reform, the Government
iimnediately adjusted import tariffs after the devaluation, and intends to remove most non-tariff
barriers, eliminate import exonerations, and simplify foreign trade procedures. These reforms are
expected to create a more open and competitive economy. At the same time, a comprehensive debt
work-out at concessional terms is expected to lead to a sustained reduction in debt servicing. The
PFP anticipates that growth will accelerate to over 6 percent annually from 1995 onwards, led by a
sustained increase in levels of investment. This increase in investment will be concentrated in the
private sector, and is expected to come in response to implementation of structural reforms in areas
such as trade, and the overall business environment, finance, the labor market, as investors'
confidence in the Ivorian economy recovers.
4.    Sector Background.  The main sources of energy in CMte d'Ivoire are biomass,
hydrocarbons, and hydroelectric power.  Electricity demand, under average hydrological
conditions, is satisfied by roughly equal proportions of hydro-electric power and, thermal energy
based on fuel oil produced by the Societe Ivoirienne de Raffinage (SIR) refinery from imported
crude oil. RCI has also been importing about 50MW per year from the Volta River Authority
(VRA) in Ghana. RCI's dependence on imported oil, which presently absorbs about 25 percent of
total export earnings, has increased over the past as domestic oil fields have been shut down and
imports of electricity from Ghana have been curtailed. This dependence on foreign sources,
however, is being reduced by: (i) accelerating the development of natural gas reserves already
discovered offshore, (ii) managing energy demand, and (iii) optimizing the utilization of local
refining capacity to increase the level of domestically produced high-value petroleum products. In
addition, natural gas-based power generation will contribute to power supply reliability and meet
any demand increase over the medium term. The least-cost power supply program, as envisaged
under the proposed project, includes expansion of generating capacity utilizing natural gas, and
preparing for private sector participation in the rehabilitation, ownership and operation of some
existing thermal units, which may also be equipped to use natural gas. Between 1970 and 1994,
electricity demand has grown by over 6 percent per year. It stagnated over 1990 to 1994 due to the
economic recession; however, with the economic turnaround now occurring as a result of the above
mentioned economic reform program, electricity demand grew by 7 percent between February 1994
and February 1995, and is expected to continue growing at slightly over 5 percent per year
hereafter. Given the hydrologic variability of the power system and demand growth, new generating
capacity is needed.
5.    Up to 1990 the electricity sub-sector was a public sector monopoly held by Energie
Electrique de la Cote d'Ivoire (EECI). In November 1990, faced with mounting financial losses
and performance problems, the power sector was reorganized. The public sector continues to hold
assets and determine overall system expansion with oversight of DCGTx, a state enterprise which
supervises public works. The private sector "Compagnie Ivoirienne d'Electricite" (CIE) leases
the assets and operates the interconnected electric utility system across RCI, under a 15-year
franchise contract. GOCI created the Fonds National de l 'Energie Electique (FNEE) to handle
the sector's cash flow, fuel transactions and debt and to assure the sector's financial equilibrium.
These structural changes have produced major improvement in power sector operations. The sector
now earns operating profits, whereas before 1990 it was accumulating large losses. CIE is quoted
on the Abidjan stock exchange, and it has public share holdings paying dividends in the range of 10
to 15 percent. CIE collects over 97 percent of its billings within 30 days after due date versus 65
percent in 1990. Annual outage duration per customer has decreased from 50 hours to 18 hours.
Staff per 1000 customers has decreased from 9.5 to 6.9. The main remaining performance issues
relate to the tariff setting process, Governmental arrears on electricity consumption, accountancy



of the sector's debt, more systematic and transparent regulatory arrangements, and improved
operational allocation of sector management responsibilities. These issues are all to be addressed
under the proposed project.
6.    In 1990, using a transparent bidding procedure, the Government invited proposals from
twenty-four potential private investors to produce gas from the Foxtrot offshore field and in
December 1992 signed a Concession Agreement with the consortium of predominantly private
project sponsors, CENCI, who would produce gas and electricity as one combined project.
Pursuant to the firning-up of oil and gas reserves in the Lion and Panthere fields, the Government,
in consultation with the Bank, decided that it would be more economic to change the hydrocarbons
production strategy, giving preference to production from Lion and Panthere, to be followed some
years later by Foxtrot. This change in strategy involved developing separate agreements with
different private sector operators in the hydrocarbons and electricity sub-sectors. United Meridian
International is the main stakeholder in the hydrocarbons concession, and CIPREL, a private
company owned mainly by Bouygues and Electricite de France, owns the gas turbine plant. IFC
has provided financial support to both of these enterprises. CIPREL is the first Indenpendant
Power Producer (IPP) in sub-Saharan Africa.
7.     Project Objectives. The project's objectives are to: (i) continue the restructuring of power
sector institutions begun under the ESAL (Report P-5165 IVC), particularly an appropriate
regulatory framework and strengthen institutional capabilities develop of competitive and expanded
private sector participation, thus inducing private sector participation in a competitive manner, (ii)
improve power system reliability, reduce environmental impacts and reduce the cost of electricity
by supporting efficient gas-fired capacity using indigenous natural gas and developed under a
private sector "BOOT" arrangement; and (iii) enhance operational reliability and efficiency through
reinforcement and improvements of the transmission system.
8.    Project Description. The project (US$86.29 million) includes the following three
components: (i) Institutional Development (US$9.49 million) including: (a) a sector management
study (dealing with distribution of sector responsibilities, power sector regulation, manpower
planning and training requirements, and implementation arrangements), (b) a power system
investment, operations and tariff study (dealing with load forecast, least-cost system expansion
analysis, tariff study and arrangements to transfer the skills and materials needed to keep these
instruments up-to-date), (c) measures to encourage power sector privatization (including the
preparation of standard bid documents for attracting IPPs and a study to determine the future role
of the existing steam-based generation units), (d) hydrocarbon sub-sector strengthening (including
a production and distribution system planning study and development of a production strategy for
NGL utilization, with implementation arrangements); (ii) Generation Expansion (US$50 million)
Phase II of the CIPREL power plant, and (iii) Complementary Sector Investments (US$26.8
million) including (a) extension of the 90kV bus at Vridi, (b) reinforcement of the transmission
system around Abidjan, (c) rebuilding of the Treichville substation, and (d) replacement of 60
kilometers of 15kV cables, all of which are required for power system integrity. The breakdown of
the project cost and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are presented in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the Republic
of C6te d'lvoire, including key economic indicators, are given in Schedules C and D respectively.
9.     Project Implementation. The Ministry of Mines and Energy of C6te d'Ivoire will ensure
overall responsibility for project implementation and compliance with the contractual



- 4 -
arrangements.  The generation plant component will be carried out by CIPREL.  The
implementation of the complementary sector investments and the institutional building component
will be executed by the Project Unit with the assistance of EECI, DCGTx, and PETROCI, carried
out by the Ministry with the support of consultants selected in accordance with Bank guidelines.
10.    Project Sustainability. Overall, the project aims at strengthening the capacity to manage
the energy sector and the power subsector efficiently, in particular through disengagement of the
State from management and focusing the role of the Government on policy definition and sector
regulation. The technical assistance under the project will assist the Ministry of Mines and Energy
in setting-up and carrying out regulatory functions (including tariff administration) and in
developing expertise in energy and other relevant institutions planning and financial management.
These arrangements will facilitate growth of more private sector participation and competition,
which themselves will contribute to sustained efficiency.
11.   Lessons learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. The Bank has been involved
in the energy sector in Cote d'Ivoire since the first Power Loan (Ln. 1896-RCI) in 1980. The 1982
Petroleum Exploration Project (Ln. 2189-RCI) confirmed Cote d'Ivoire's hydrocarbon potential,
making it clear that incentives were needed in order to attract private investment in hydrocarbon
resources. Bank support for sector reform dates from early 1986 when, as part of SAL III, the
Government adopted a first set of measures aimed at a reforn of energy policies over the medium
term. The principal lesson learned stems from the Energy Sector Adjustment Loan (Ln. 3150-IVC)
(Project Completion Report No. 11532), which highlighted the need to call upon the private sector
for the development of Cote d'lvoire's energy resources and provide support for the privatization of
the management of the electricity sector. The project supports increased private sector investment
in the power sector. Furtherrnore the project emphasizes the development of complementary policy
and regulatory functions and training in the areas of energy planning and financial management.
12.    Rationale for IDA Involvement: The proposed credit is consistent with the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS-June 1994), and would support an integrated package of goods,
services and advice all designed to assist the progress of dote d'Ivoire's power sector into
increasingly pro-competitive, private sector modes of operation. Major priorities in the FY95-97
CAS are to help the Government: (i) maintain macroeconomic stability and strengthen public
sector finances through reforms in both revenue and expenditure, (ii) promote private sector
development through continued liberalization of trade, financial and labor markets, and through
investments in productive activities, including energy, (iii) increase the effectiveness of the human
resources development program through increased focus on primary health care, AIDS, basic
education, and population policy, (iv) strengthen institutional capacity through existing IDA-
supported technical assistance programs, and (v) intensify environmental work through projects
and the National Environment Action Plan (NEAP) process. The assistance strategy is being
implemented through (i) active portfolio management, involving enhanced project supervision and
elimination of undisbursed IBRD balances, (ii) an intensified policy dialogue on macroeconomic,
sector-specific, social, and environmental issues, (iii) adjustment lending in support of policy
reforms in agriculture, transport, private sector development, and finance, and (iv) a reactivation of
the project pipeline. The proposed Private Sector Energy project is an integral part of this effort.
13.   The Bank has been assisting GOCI since the late 1980s with the reform of the energy
sector. GOCI has made a solid commitment to private sector participation in the power sector,
firstly by leasing the system to a private consortium, secondly by introducing an independent power
producer, and thirdly by seeking through the proposed project to improve sector regulation, the



- 5 -
tariff setting mechanism and processes for developing more private sector participation and
competition. GOCI and the Bank have co-operated closely on the evolution of this project - first to
be based on natural gas from the Foxtrot field, but then restructured to take advantage of the newly
confirmed oil and gas reserves in the Lion and Panthere fields; the hydrocarbon and power
production ventures were separated and are being developed by private companies with IFC
participation.
14.    GOCI issued requests for proposals on the power project and selected a consortium of
Bouygues/Electricite de France, which formed the nucleus of CIPREL. GOCI and CIPREL
negotiated an agreement whereby a 165MW gas turbine project would be developed in two phases:
Phase I (99MW) to be financed by private sector equity and debt, and Phase II (66MW) to be
financed by GOCI funds relent on commercial terms to CIPREL. This financial structure reflected
the exposure limits of the private sector and other lenders for this operation. This agreement is the
first of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa and has been key to stimulate private sector participation in
the power sector in the aftermath of the devaluation. Given the lack of available external financing
and the Government's desire to have continued active IDA involvement in the sector, GOCI
requested IDA's participation in the second phase of the power component of the reconfigured
project. The Bank agreed to appraise an amended project, indicating that any eventual financing
from IDA would have to be complementary to that of the private sector and supportive of a
stronger private sector role in the power system.
15.    Part of the proposed credit would include financing of the CIPREL Phase II capacity. IDA
participation in the Phase II capacity development would assist GOCI with a competitive
procurement process for the plant. Another part of the proposed credit would support improved
efficacy and sustainability of reformed sector structures, designed to expand the future role of the
private sector. The proposed project includes provision for improved arrangements to regulate the
sector and manage the introduction of more IPPs, stimulating competition for the market and
within the market. System expansion analysis undertaken for the project indicates that with
expected economic performance, CMte d'Ivoire will need about 260MW of new capacity beyond
CIPREL over the next ten years, which is enough to foresee the beginnings of competitive market
conditions in power generation. The proposed Credit would be fully consistent with the Bank's
policy on lending to the electric power sector, given GOCI's actions and commitments with respect
to transparent regulation, commercialization, private sector participation and contracting out of
services. The use of IDA resources also recognizes that CMte d'Ivoire is an indebted IDA country
recently emerging from a long recession assisted by a Bank/Fund adjustment program, an
important element of which was the halving of the CFA franc vis-a-vis the French franc exchange
rate.
16.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following matters:
(i) CAA will prepare a detailed schedule for the Power Sector debts no later than February 1,
1996, ii) GOCI commitment on settlement of Government electricity bill and settlement of arrears
by June 30, 1996, iii) letter of sector development policy, iv) detailed terms of reference for studies
and procurement to be done according to IDA guidelines, v) annual audits for project accounts and
special account, and CIPREL accounts by independent auditors satisfactory to IDA, vi)
presentation of semi-annual progress reports and mid-term review no later than June 30, 1997 and
vii) annual review of electricity tariffs by November based on agreed financial performance criteria
for the power sector. As conditions of effectiveness, (i) a Subsidiary Loan Agreement will be
signed between the Government and CIPREL, (ii) GOCI will open a Project Account and deposit
US$200,000 equivalent, (iii) all amendments to the Convention between the Government and



CIPREL and the Loan Agreement between CIPREL and its lenders for Phase I will be signed, and
(iv) GOCI will adopt the final Implementation Manual for the project.
17.    Environmental Aspects. Positive global environmental impacts are expected from the
project by moving away from liquid fuels and biomass to natural gas which should lead to a
decrease in air and water pollution in the Abidjan area (reduction of NOx, SOx and C02).
18.    The main environmental mitigation measures needed for the CIPREL plant relate to noise
level, risk of oil spills, waste disposal and risks of fires and explosions. The noise level of the gas
turbines will not exceed 85dB(A) at one meter, as a result of adding acoustic enclosures. The new
gas turbines will not affect the present noise level at nearest residential areas. With regard to oil
spills, the existing oil tanks in Vridi site have been refurbished and checked before use. For the
tanks on CIPREL site, a retention basin is installed with a complete fire protection and detection
system. Liquid wastes are drained to an existing settling pit and after separation, water is sent to
the Vridi collection and rejection system. There are no other liquid effluents from the gas turbines.
Regarding the risks of fires and explosions, there will be gas and fire detection systems, as well as
fire fighting systems consisting of CO2 for the gas turbines, water for the overall site and foam
injection for the oil storage tanks. There will be regular verification of alarm and fire fighting
systems, as well as personnel training.
19.    Program Objective Categories. The project would help restore Cote d'lvoire's economic
competitiveness by utilizing domestic natural gas, a relatively cheap energy source for electricity
generation and for refining operations, and by increasing the supply of electricity. This should help
increasing employment opportunities particularly in the private sector, increasing access to
electricity and reducing energy costs to the end-users.
20.    Participatory Approach.  GOCI spearheaded the CIPREL project concept and the
negotiation of the GOCIICIPREL general agreement, with the help of IDA-financed technical
assistance. GOCI also constituted an effective and committed project development team, having
expertise from all relevant power sector institutions. This project team has been meeting frequently
with CIPREL and Bank staff in order to facilitate timely project implementation. The institutional
reform and sector planning program has been thoroughly discussed with and is supported by all
key sector institutions. It is GOCI's view that the public welcomes measures to expand electricity
supply and reduce its cost, as evidenced by the resumption of demand growth and the priority being
accorded to power system development.
21.    Project Benefits. The project would be an example of effective private/public sector
collaboration helping to restore the confidence of foreign private investors in RCI, and reinforce the
Govermnent's intention to attract private capital. The project's economic rate of return of 34
percent is well above the opportunity cost of capital and project revenues will be able to cover all
costs. The project is expected to result in lower costs and increased reliability of power supply, tap
a private sector stream of financing for the energy sector with a minimum of sovereign guarantees,
reduce crude oil imports, generate foreign exchange from electricity exports, and improve sector
management arrangements conducive to broader and deeper private sector participation.
22.    Risks. The major risk is related to the sustainability of the Government's will to implement
and administer properly functioning regulatory, tariff setting and financial management
arrangements for the sector. This risk is being addressed in the following three ways: (i) the
Govermnent's letter of sector development policy contains commitments to see through the proper



-7 -
implementation of measures needed to assure the sustenance of an efficient sector structure; (ii)
technical assistance is being provided through the project to create supportive institutional
arrangements, and (iii) IDA's on-going participation in the sector, made possible through IDA's
support to this project, will provide for sustained dialogue and assistance as needed. As the private
sector becomes increasingly important to the country's power supply, adequate regulatory, tariff
and financial management arrangements are likely to be sustained. Potential environmental impacts
of the CIPREL investment have been assessed and the project includes mitigative measures. The
project does not present any special technical or managerial difficulties. For the power plant,
CIPREL's owners are experienced and highly qualified to undertake such projects, CIPREL
commissioned Phase I of the project on schedule and within cost, and CIPREL is also responsible
for completion of Phase II within cost. CIE will be the plant operator, with contractual
commitments to maintain plant performance; it is experienced in thermal plant operations. The
works on the "complementary investments" will be procured according to Bank procurement rules
and procedures and supervised by consultants acceptable to IDA.
23.   Recommendation. I amn satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
