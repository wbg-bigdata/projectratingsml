EXPLOITATION OF GAS FOXTROT
SUMMARY Or ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
1.       INTRODUCTION
1.1     Background
1.1.1   A proposal based on an integrated concept including gas
production, gas transport, gas processing, gas distribution and
electricity production was put forward in April 1992 by the private
sector for African Development Bank funding.
1.1.2    The Bank policy requires an environmental impact assessment.
Soil and Water Ltd in associarion with Ekono Corporation was engaged
to carry out the study. The purpose of the EIA-study was to:
- analyse and specify environmental impacts;
- examine the existing policy and legislative measures and
- prepare mitigative measures and monitoring plans for all
adverse effects.
1.1.3    The EIA-study has been carried out under the supervision of
the Ministry of the Environment of COte d'Ivoire.
1.2      Policy. leaal and administrative framework
1.21     Existing legislation and codes
1.21.1   The "Code Pftrolier" (No 70-489, August 3, 1970) is the most
important law, when evaluating the environmental impact of the Gas
Foxtrot project. The decree 70-528 (September 2, 1970) determines the
modes of application of the OCode P6trolier".
1.21.2   For wastewater discharges there are some regulations
concerning the quality and amount of discharges. French or US
regulations are often applied in addition to national standards.
1.21.3   There is a law concerning waste managemen: (No 88-651,
July 7,1988), which gives some rules for the management of toxic or
harmful industrial and sanitary waste.
1.21.4   The 'Code du Travail" (September 2, 1970) is the basis for
the health regulations for workers.
1.22     Gaps in legislation
1.22.1   There are no laws controlling air quality.



ii
1.23    Administrative framework
1.23.1   The *Minist6re de l'Environnement de la Construction et de
l'Urbanisme" is responsible for preparing the government's
environmental program and defining guidelines for a national
environmental policy. The Ministry is preparing an Environment Code
which will come into force in a few years time. The "MinistAre de la
Sante et de la Protection Sociale" is responsible for public health
and the quality of life. The "Kinist6re de l'Interieur et de la
securitV" takes part in all operations directed at upgrading and
preserving the environment. The "Kinist6re de 1'Economie et des
Finances" manages state credit allocated to the protection and
development of the environment.
1.3      Supervision and Permit Procedures
1.3.1    The law and decrees for dangerous, unhealthy or harmful
establishments (D6cret, October 20, 1926, Arrete general, April 25,
1927 and Arret6 local 3270, December 20, 1932) are the basis for
permit and supervision procedures.
1.3.2    Permits set conditions for air emissions, waste water
discharges, solid waste and other environmental issues. Regulations
for the health of the workers are also set. The conditions for
environmental pollution are set case by case.
1.3.3    Permits for the construction and operation of the platform,
pipelines, gas treatment plant and power plant will be given by the
WMinist&re de l'Industrie, des Mines et de 1 Energie", the "Minist&re
de 1'Environnement de la Construction et de l'Urbanisme" and the
"Minist6re de la Sante et de la Protection Sociale".
2.       PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.1      General description
2.1.1    The natural gas field of Foxtrot is located on the
continental shelf of C8te d' voire, about 80 km southwest from
Abidjan. The development of the Foxtrot field requires the
utilization of a production platform, which will be installed
approximately 15 km offshore at a water depth of 102 m. It has been
estimated that four wells are sufficient to ensure the efficient
production of natural gas.
2.1.2    The project is in a feasibility study phase. No detailed
design has been carried out.
2.1.3    According to preliminary plans the natural gas
(2.4 million m'ed) will be treated by a three-stage separator
resulting in gas, condensates and water. The gas and condensates will
be reunited after dehydration and conveyed via a submarine gas
pipeline. Offshore gas pipeline will be buried in the sea bottom and
the onshore pipe will be installed in a tunnel.
2.1.4    According to preliminary plans the gas pipeline ends in a
treatment plant located west of the Canal de Vridi near Abidjan. The
gas and condensates are once again separated prior to their separate
distribution.



iii
2.1.5    The gas is to be connected in an underground pipeline under
the Canal de Vridi to a new thermal power plant of Vridi and its
extensions to the oil refinery of SIR (Soci6td Ivoirienne de
Raffinaae). The capacity of the new thermal power plant will be
120.. .50 MW. The plant will use natural gas as a primary energy
source, but will also be able to use heavy vacuum oil when required.
Coolinc water will be taken from the Canal de Vridi and returned to
the channel after chlorination. The expected flue gas and cooling
water flow will be 1170 t/h and 21000 t/h. The height of the chimney
of the power plant will be 25 m-
2.1.6   According to p-eliminary plans a separate oil pipeline will
convey the condensates to SIR.
3.      BASELINE DATA
3.1     Atmospheric environment
3.1.1    The climate in COte d'Ivoire is subeouatorial and humid. The
rainy season in the coastal part of C8te d'Ivoire starts in March and
lasts until the middle of July. A short showery season starts in the
middle of September and lasts until November. A long dry season
starts in December and lasts until March. The annual rainfall varies
from 35 mm in February to 490 mm in June. Annual temperatures vary
between 21.. .29C.
3.1.2    Winds in the Abidjan area are mostly southernly,
southwesternly and southeasternly. The average wind velocity is
2 m/s. Maximum wind velocities are 15 - 27 mls. A -tormy period
occurs in July - August every year. Severe tropical storms with
exceptionally high wave conditions (4... 5 m) occur about once every
20 years.
3.1.3   Air emissions in C8te d'Ivoire originate from industry,
traffic and bush fires. The contribution of COte d'Ivoire to regional
or global emissions is low. The amounts and sources of the main
Pollutants in Abidjan are presented in Table 3.1.-In Abidjan there is
no monitoring of air quality.

Traffic                  2 190      8 030      5 4B0
3.2      Terrestrial environment
3.2.1    The coastal zor.e in the project area Addah - Abidjan
consists of a low-lying barrier lagoon system composed of Quaternary
sand. The system is backed by Tertiary continental plateaus.



iv
3.2.2    The ocean shore lies on ar. 8 km wide and well-developed sand
spit which is covered by natural vegetation, extensive commercial
coconut plantations and small gardens. The spit is Lacked by the
Lagune Ebrie and encloses wetlands and some small pure freshwater
lakes of importance to the ground water supply. These lakes are quite
close to the proposed site for the gas treatment plant. The water
table here is very shallow.
3.2.3    The Lagune Ebri6 is the most seriously polluted lagoon in
C6te d'Ivoire. The major threats to the lagoon are municipal and
industrial waste waters and agricultural activities. The lagoon is an
important area for fish and shrimp reproduction. It is an essential
habitat for numerous species of fish and bird migrants. The lagoon is
bordered by marshlands of sweet water and mangroves.
3.2.4    There is only a little information available about the
seismic activity in C8te d'Ivoire. Most vibrations are distant. The
vibrations are in the southern part of the country mostly 2... 4 in
magnitude on the Richter scale. At least three stronger eartquakes of
magnitude 6 have been measured in neighbouring countries and in the
Gulf of Guinea.
3.3     Marine environment
3.3.1   The COte dcIvoLre sedimentary basin is developed along the
West-Africa coast from Liberia to Chana. It has its extension
olffshore where the continental shelf is about 25.. .30 km wide. Total
area of the basin is 7000 km2. Up to 10.000 metres of sediments are
accumulated in the basin in shallow and moderate water depths. The
surface sediments on the sea bottom vary from coarse sand to fine
mud.
3.3.2     The Foxtrot gas field was discovered in 1981. Hydrocarbons
occur in Upper Albien sandstones lying at depths of approximately
2100 .. 2500 r below sea level.
3.3.3    The warm eastward flowing =Guinea current washes the shores
at an average surface speed of 0.3...11 1ms. The sediment load in
the current is estimated at 800 000 m2/year. A feeble undercurrent,
the ulvoirien-, flows in the opposite direction at a speed of
0.3... 0.7 m/s- Tides are semidi%rnal._ The tidal ranges are sMall with
a mean tidal range of about 1.5 m. A characteristic Atlantic swell
affects the region with a wave height of between 1...1.8 m. The
strongest swell occurs between May and August.
3.3.4    Coastal erosion is typical in a-eas of coastal barrier-
lagoon systems. The coastal erosion in the area Addah-Abidjan is on
average 1.5.. .2.5 meters per year.
3.3.5    Flora in the sublittoral is represented by the micro-algae
of the plankton and occasional detached floating micro-algae. The
invertebrate fauna relate to depth and substrate.
3.3.6    Fish fauna can be divided into two communities depending on
water depth: the Sciaenid (0..50 m) and the Sparid (> 50 m). The
Sciaenid community includes some important commercial fish: ombres-,
capitaines, barracudas and sardines. The Sparid community includes
beams, various sharks and rays, groupers, dentex and mackerel.
3.3.7    There are no coral reefs in C8te d'Ivoire.



v
3.4      Human environment
3.4.1    The commune of Jacqueville is situated west of Abidjan and
has its extension from Addah to the west of the "Canal de Vridi'.
Addah is situated north of the gas field. The commune consists of
seven villages and has an estimated-population of 30 000 habitants.
The population consists mostly of Alladjans, Ahizis and Akouris,
labour from other part of C6te d'Ivoire and immigration from
neighbouring countries (Ghana, Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali etc.). One
sector of the population engages in fishing, the other constitutes a
labour force in coconut and palm oil plantations.
3.4.2    Two small villages Pedeka and Alko, near the Lagune Ebri6
west of Canal de Vridi have each a population of at least 50 in
habitants. Two other hamlets Brakre and Vridi, with at least 200 in
habitants are situated 3,5 km and 5 km near the sea.:This area is
covered by coconut farms and Vridi's preserved forest. There is an
unmetalled track, which crosses the zone from east to west. The
industrial zone in Vridi has been limited since 1950's by a
spontaneous village in the south and by modern resedential quarters
in the east.
3.4.3    An industrial zone is situated east of the Canal de Vridi.
This zone has impressive industrial activity anid petroleum
infrastructure. The SIR (Societe Ivoirienne de Raffinage) dispose a
refinery and EECI (Energie Electrique de C8te d'Ivoire) dispose a
thermal power plant. Neighbouring industry is numerous and various:
oil mill, chemical industry, plate factory etc.
3.4.4    Commercial fishing is the most important element in the
economy of the Cote d'Ivoire. The marine element is rich in fish, due
to the prevailing cur-ent and upwelling systems. The enthusiastic
migrant element in the workforce is a testimony to this. The Lagune
Ebrie is also productive and could be more so if pollution could be
controlled and reduced.
4.      IMACTS
4.1      Methodolo-v
4.1.1    Every significant cause and effect relationship has been
analysed by means of the following components:
- activity, action or operation,
- impact (cause),
- target,
- effect,
- nature of effect (positive/negative),
- probability of realisation,
- seriousness (usefulness) of effects,
- need for mitigative measures,
- description o- required mitigative measures,
- remarks (background information).
4.1.2    All analysed relationships have been presented as separate
cards. The use of the card format is to ensure sound analysis. Only
the most important impacts are presented in this chapter.



vi
4.2      Positive impacts
4.21     Atmospheric environment
4.21.1   From an environmental point of view, natural gas is a
feasible energy source with applicable-technology. The change from
oil to natural gas will decrease air pollution of C6te d'Ivoire
remarkably. The estimated reduction in CO2 emissions is 50 % and that
of NO, emissions 70 % in the combusLion phase, when compared to the
use of oil.
4.22     Human environment
4.22.1   The project will not create many new jobs, since most
employees will be removed from the present energy production. About
150 workers will be needed during the construction of the offshore
platform and 50 workers for the construction of the onshore treatment
Plant. The project will also introduce new technology and know-how,
which will have a positive impact on the development of COte
d'Ivoire.
4.23     Other Positive impacts
4.23.1   The use of natural gas will reduce the import of oil
significantly. The gas field Foxtrot is estimated to produce gas for
at least 18.5 years on the basis of energy consumption forecasts.
4.3      Ri-sk of necrgative impoacts
4.31     Terrestrial environment
4.31.1   There are no major risks for the terrestial environment. The
construction of the onshore gas pipeline and gas treatment plant will
cause some soil erosion and loss of land area. This will disturb
domestic animals, vegetation and dunes to some extent.
4.31.2   The uncont-rolled disposal of empty containers, oil barrels,
solvents etc. during routine operation of the plant could lead to
pollution and health hazards.
4.32     Marine environment
4.32.1   The major risks for the marine environment (e.g. benthic
invertebrates, plankton, fish, seabirds, marine mammals and flora)
consist of accidental fluid blowouts, gas leaks and leaks of toxic
chemicals and oil.
4.32.2   Increased boat traffic is a risk and accidents may cause oil
pollution duz to spillage of fuel and lubricants.
4.32.3   Dredging, ploughing and suction operations in pipeline
installation as well as accumulation of mud and drilling cuttings
from drilling operations may lead to the release of nutrients, oxygen
starvation and higher turbidity. This can lead to degradation of
marine flora and fauna.



vii
4.33     Atmospheric environment
4.33.1  Replacing oil with natural gas will dramatically reduce the
present national level of pollutant loading. Burning hydrocarbons in
the torch and generation of power by gas turbines or diesel will
result in continuous air emissions of SO2, CO2 and NO,. CO2 will
contribute to the greenhouse effect, No, and 502 will cause local air
pollution and acicification of soil and water.
4.34     Human environment
4.34.1   In comparison with all other fuels, gas is and will remain
capricious. Uncontrolled gas leaks, fires and explosions can result
in injury and loss of human life as well as damage to plant and
structures.
4.34.2   Overdose of chlorine in treatment of potable water,
defective hoists when lifting objects etc. may cause accidents to
employees.
4.34.3   The level of noise due to power and steam generation
systemls, drilling operations etc. may lead in extreme cases to loss
of hearing, lowered visual activity and increased accident rates.
4.34.4   The platform area is a good fishing ground and it will
attract more fishing boats. The conflict of interest between platform
safety on the one hand and fishing opportunities on the other, may-
lead to problems between piatform persennel and fishermen.
4.34.5   The two spontaneous villages on the western and eastern
banks of the Canal de Vridi are located within the safety zones oI
the gas treatment plant and the new thermal power plant. Although
there is no legal basis for the existence of these villages, they
have become a sensitive issue with sociological considerations. This
needs careful handling.
4.34.6   The careful choice of treatment plant location makes the
migration unnecessary. In the case of the new power plant, the
implementation of the safety zone faces the fact that there is no
safety zone for- the existing power plant.
4.4      Cumulative im=act
4.4.1    The project has a positive impact on the environment. Risks
of negative impacts can be controlled in an efficient way.
5.       ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
5.1      The replacement of oil with natural gas will reduce the
level of pollutant loading when compared with the present situation.
In earlier feasibility studies Azito was named as an alternative to
Vridi for the location of the new power plant. Vridi and Azito are
equally suitable from an environmental point of view.
5.2      If the Vridi alternative is chosen, investment costs would
be lower as the infrastructure already exists. However, the existing
power plant (EECI), oil refinery (SIR) and the new thermal power



viii
plant would then all be located in the same restricted area. In the
event of catastrophe, the energy supply of Cote d'Ivoire may be
seriously disturbed.
6.      MITIGATION MEASURES
6.1     Terrestrial environment
6.1.1    There are no major risks for the terrestial environment.
A collection system for overflows and spillage is required as well as
control of the disposal of chemical containers, oil barrels etc. to
avoid pollution of soil, ground and surface water.
6.2     Marine environment
6.2.1    The most important measures to protect the marine
environment are as follows:
- all oily waters must be treated by multi-stage separation,
- all waters violating pH-limits (<6 and >8,5) must be
neutralized,
- when discharging sewage, solids must be ground to promote
their dispersion. Chlorination or preferably UV-
disinfection is required only if the coliforms exceed
200/100 ml,
- sewage water from -the onshore plants must be led to the
municipal sewerage system,
- all kind of offshore dnmping are prohibited,
- water based or non-toxic muds should be used in drilling
operations,
- the submarine pipeline needs a safety cover or it must be
buried in the sea bottom,
- safety basins for glycol and oil tanks are required.
6.3     Atmosgheric environment
6.3.1    The major risks to the atmospheric environment consist of
C°2 emissions and NO, emissions. The use of natural gas will
significantly reduce air emissions.
6.3.2    There is no cost effective way to reduce CO2 emissions. NO1
emissions may be reduced to an acceptable level by combustion
technique.
6.4      Human environment
6.4.1    The elimination of major safety risks requires the following
measures:
- use of oils that do not develop PCB when burning,
- installation of effective gas and fire detection systems
and fire fighting systems,
- an emergency shut-down system must be installed to isolate
gas leakage areas,
- use of wellhead safety valves, blowout preventors and
choke/kill valves to prevent gas leaks during drilling
operations,



- an emergency power generation system is required,
- clear rules should be used for maintenance operations,
- an efficient evacuation system is required.
6.4.2    Relocation of part of the population living in the two
spontaneous villages on the western -and eastern banks of the Canal de
Vridi. These villages are located in the safety zones (500 m) of the
gas treatment plant and the new thermal power plant. This should be
car-ied out carefully by informing the people in advance that they
will be offered a compensatory land area.
6.5      Costs created mainlX by environmental demands
6.5.1    The estimated total cost created by environmental demands is
2 700 000 USD. This includes:
- collection and transportation of drilling mud and cuttings
during the drilling operation, cost 1 000 000 USD,
- steam injection to reduce NO, emissions from the power
plant (when using oil), cost 1 100 000 USD
- detailed studies of the sediment structure in the gas
field, cost 150 000 USD
- relocation of the people on the western (gas treatment
plant area) and eastern banks (new power plant area) of the
Canal de Vridi, cost 100 000 USD
- dispersion calculations for the platform and power plant,
cost 40 000 USD
- recommended offshore geophysical survey cost 250 000 USD
- recommended investigations and measurements of the amount
of coastal erosion west of Canal de Vridi, cost 50 000 USD.
7.       MONITORING SYSTEM
7.1      The monitoring system is defined in Table 7.1. Requirements
are valid in the whole system from the gas field to the new power
plant.

for personnel, safety officers and authorities so that given
principles will be implemented in an efficient way.
8.3      Policv and leaal strenQthenina
8.3.1    The laws on air quality and waste management and on workers'
safety should be clarified. A clearer division of responsibilities
between the various Ministries is essential for an efficient
environmental policy.
9.      PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
9.1      The artisanal fishermen and the authorities consulted during
the EIA-study were sympathetic to the gas project. The chief social
problem arising from this project is the relocation of the people in
the spontaneous villages. The majority of the people contacted were
not aware of the project and had very little understanding of it.
However, it is possible to reduce the need of relocation by a careful
choice of location of. the treatment plant and the new power plant.

EXPLOITATION DU GAZ FOXTROT
RESUME DE L'EVALUATION DE LrIMPACT SUR L'ENVIRONNEMNT
1.       INTRODUCTION
1.1     LL'arri6re-plan
1.1.1    Une proposition fondee sur un concept integre visant la
Production du gaz, le transport du gaz, le gaz d6veloppant, la
distribution du gaz et la production de l'&lectricit& a ete
lanc&e en avril 1992 par le secteur prive pour les Fonds de la
Banque Africaine de Developpement.
1.1.2    La pratique de la Banque fait 1' evaluation des impacts
sur l'environnement ri6cessaire. Soil and Water Ltd en
association avec Ekono Corporation a ete choisi pour effectuer
1'6tude. Le but de letude EIE 6tait le suivant:
- analyser et specifier les effets des impacts sur
1'environnement;
- examiner la pratique actuelle et las mesures
16gislatives et
- employer des mesures correctives et proposer un plan
de contr8le pour tous les effets defavorables.
1.1.3-   L'etude de 1'EIE a et& poursuivie sous la supervision
du Ministere de l1'Environnement de la CMte d'Ivoire.
1.2      Praticrue-et structures 16crale et administrative
1.21     La 16crislation et le r-qlement actuels
1.21.1   Le Code Petrolier (NO 70-489, 3 aoUt 1970) represente
la loi la plus significative, quand on evalue les impacts du
projet du gaz Foxtrot sur 1'environnement. Le d6cret 70-528
(2 septembre 1970) definit les modalit6s d'application du -Code
Petroliern.
1.21.2   Quelques r6glementations concernant les eaux usees sont
en vigeur, et elles tiennent compte de la nature et de la
quantite de ces dechets. Les reglementations francaises et nord-
am6ricaines sont souvent appliquees en plus des mesures
nationales standards.
1.21.3   I1 existe une loi portant sur la gestion des dechets
solides (No 88-651, 7 juillet 1988), qui proclame des regles sur



ii
la gestion des d6chets sanitaires et industriels toxiques et
nocifs.
1.21.4   Le Code du Travail (2 septembre 1970) presente les
r6gles de base touchant la sante des_travailleurs.
1.22    Les lacunes dans la 1Eislation
1.22.1  I1 n'existe aucune loi qai contr6le la qualit6 de
l'air.
1.23    La structure administrative
1-23.1  Le Ministere de l'Environnement, de la Construction et
de l'Urbanisme" se rend responsable de la preparation du
programme s'appliquant a llenvironnement ainsi que des lignes
directrices de ce dernier en vue d'une pratique nationale de
1'environnement. Le Minist6re est en train de pr6parer un Code
de 1'Environnement qui entrera en vigeur d'ici quelques annees.
Le Minist6re de la Sant& et de la Protection Sociale *st
responsable de la sant6 publique et de la qualit& de La vie. Le
Ministere de 1'lnterieur et de la Securit6 participe A tous les
optrations d'am6liorer et de preserver l'environnement. Le
Ministtre de 1'Economie et des Finances gtre un cr6dit allou&
par 1'Etat en vue de la protection et du d6veloppemnent de
1'environnement.
1.3      Supervision et roc6dures des Dermis
1.3.1    La loi et les dkcrets visant les etablissements &
caractere dangereux, insalubre et nocif (D6cret du 20 octobre
1926). Arret6 gin6ral du 28 avril 1927 et Arret& local 3270 du
20 decembre 1932) sont les fondements des procedures de
supervision et de permis.
1.3.2    Dans les permis apparattront les conditions concernant
les emissions de i'air, les d6chets de l'eau usie, les d4chets
solides ainsi que d'autres probl&mes adjacents. Des
r6glementations protegeant la sante des travailleurs seront
6galement etablies. Les conditions de la pollution de

2.       DESCRIPTION DU PROJET
2.1     Description a4n4rale
2.1.1   Le champ du gaz naturel Foxtrot est situe sur le
plateau continental de la Cote d'Ivoire A environ 80 km au sud-
ouest d'Abidjan. L'exploitation du champ Foxtrot requiert
l'utilisation d'une plate-forme de production qui serait
installee approximativement a 15 km de la plage A une profondeur
de 102 m. I1 a ete estim6 que quatre puits suffiraient a assurer
une production normale de gaz naturel.
2.1.2    Le projet du gaz Foxtrot est dans une phase d'Atude de
faisabilit.. Aucun plan precis nla te entrepris.
2.1.3   Selon les plans preliminaires le gaz naturel produit &
partir de puits (2.4 millions elId) est traite par un s6parateur
multiphasique separant le gaz, des condensats et de l'eau. Le
gaz et les condensats seront reunis apr6s d6shydratation et
achemines A terre par 1'interrndiaire d'un gazoduc sous-marin.
Le gazoduc sera enterre au fond de la mer. Dans le ressac,
celui-ci coule a l1'interieur d'un tunnel. -
2.1.4    Selon les projets prlivminaires, le gazoduc d6bouche
dans 1'unit& de traitement instal.1  a l' est du Canal de Vridi
pr&s d'Abidjan. Le gaz et les condensats sont A nouveau separes
avant leur distribution respective.
2.1.5   Le gaz sera livrfi A la nouvelle station thermique de
Vridi et a ses extensions ainsi qu A la SIR (Socift6 Ivoirienne
de Raffinage) par un gazoduc-souterrain. La capacite de la
nouvelle station thermique sera de 120...150 NW. La station
utilisera du gaz naturel comme source d'energie premiere, mais
sera aussi en mesure d'utiliser un fuel distille lourd (HVO)- De
l'eau de rafratchissement sera pr6lev6e du Canal de Vridi et
sera revers6e au canal apres chlorination. Le debit d'eau de
rafraichissement et de gaz attendu sera de 1170 tlh et
21000 t/h. La chemin6e de la station atteindra 25 m de hauteur.
2.1.6    Suivant les plans pr6minaires, les condensats sont
conduits A SIR par un oleoduc s6parx.
3.      INFORMATION DE FOND
3.1      Environnement atmosvh6ricue
3.1.1    Le climat de la C8te d'Ivoire est sub6quatorial et
humide. La saison des pluies commence sur la partie cOti&re de
la Cote d'Ivoire en mars et dure jusqu'A la mi-juillet. Une
periode courte d'averses d6bute A la mi-septembre et dure
jusqu'en novembre. Une longue saison s6che -s'amorce d6s decembre
et se poursuit jusqu'en mars. La hauteur des pr6cipitations



iv
varie de 35 mm en f6vrier A 490 mm en juin. Les temperatures
annuelles varient entre 21-C et 29"C.
3.1.2   Les vents dans la region d'Abidjan soufflent
principalement du suci, du sud-ouest et du sud-est. La vitesse
moyenne du vent est de 2 m/s. Les vitesses maximales du vent
atteignent 15 A 27 W/s. Une saison orageuse se produit en
juillet et aott chaque annee. Des violentes tempetes tropicales
provoquent des vagues d'une hauteur exceptionelle (de 4 A 5 m).
3.1.3   Les emissions d'air de la Cote d'Ivoire proviennent de
l'industrie, de la circulation et des feux de buissons. La
contribution de la Cote d'Ivoire aux amissions r6gionales et
globales reste faible. Les quantites et les sources des
polluants principaux d'Abidjan sont pr6sent6es dans le tableau
3.1. On ne contrOle pas la qualite de l'air d'Abidjan.

3.2     Environnemnent terrestre
3.2.1    La zone c8ti6re de la region du projet Addah-Abidjan
possede une lagune dont le cordon littoral de basse altitude est
composee de sable quaternaire. Un plateau continental du
tertiaire se trouve A l'arriere de celui-ci_
3.2.2    Le rivage de 1'ocean form une p6ninsule de 8 km de
large. La peninsule est pourvue d'une vig6tation raturelle.
d'une plantation extensive de cocotiers vou6e au commerce et de
petits jardins. La p6ninsule se situe derriere la Lagune Ebrie
qui renferme des marecages et quelques petits lacs d'eau fraSche
pure necessaire A la reserve souterraine. Ces lacs se trouvent A
proximit& do site choisi de l'unite de traitement du gaz. Le
niveau hydraustatique noest pas ici tres profond.
3.2.3    La Lagune Ebrie est la lagune la plus sbv6rement
pollu6e en Cote d'Ivoire. Les menaces majeures pour la lagune
relevent des avtivites agraireset et des eaux de rejet des
industries. La lagune represente un endroit particuli&rement



v
propice a la reproduction des crevettes et des poissons. C'est
un habitat essentiel pour de especes de poissons et maintes
d'oiseaux migrateurs. La lagune est bordee de marais d'eau douce
et de mangliers.
3.2.4    Peu d'informations ont  te' donnees au sujet de
l'activite sismique en Cote d'Ivoire. La plupart des vibrations
est distante. Les vibrations sont dans la partie sud du pays de
1'ordre de 2.. .4 de magnitude a l'echelle de Richter. Les trois
plus forts tremblements de terre d'une magnitude 6 ont ete
mesur&s au moins dans les pays voisins et dans le golfe de
Guinee.
3.3      Environnement marin
3.3.1    Le bassin s6dimentaire de la COte d'Ivoire est en
developpement tout le long de la cote africaine du Liberia
jusqu'au Ghana. Il etend ses limites au del& du rivage a
1'endroit oui continental atteind 25 A 30 km large. La superficie
du bassIn est de 7000 kme. Pr&s de 10 000 metres de sediments
sont accumul6s au fond du bassin d'une eau moderemment peu
profonde. Les sediments tapissant les fonds marins varient entre
un sable gras et une boue fine.
3.3.2   Le champ de gaz Foxtrot fat d6couvert en 1981. On
trouve les hydrocarbones dams les gr6s de au dessus Albien
residant dans les profondeurs au dessous du niveau de la mer a
approximatement 2100...2500 m.
3.3.3   Le courant Guinee chaud se dirigant vers lest deferte
sur le rivage A une vitesse moyenne de surface de 0.3 .......1 m/s.
La charge de sediment port&e par le courant est estime A
800 000 dsean. Un faible courant sous-marin lIvoirienw va a sens
inverse a une vitesse de 0.3...0.7 x/s. Les mar6es sont semi-
diurnes. Le courant des uar6e est faible et il se produit une
mar6e moyenne d'1.5 m environ. Une houle caract6ristique de
1'Ocean Atlantique affecte la r6gion dont la hauteur des vagues
atteind 1-..1.8 m. La houle la plus violente arrive entre mai et
aott.
3.3.4    L'1rosion cotiere est typique dams les r6gions dot6es
d'un syst6me cOtier en forme de barri4re lagune. Dans la region
d'Addah-Abidjan 1'erosion cOti&re est par endroits en moyenne de
1,5 A 2,5 m/an.
3.3.5    La flore du sublittoral est composee des micro-algues
du plancton et de micro-algues flottantes parfois d&tach6es. La
faune invert6br&e slassocie aux profondeurs et aux substrates.
3.3.6    La faune constituant les poissons peut etre divis6e
entre deux communites dFpendant de la profondeur des eaux: La
communaute des t6leosteens possede quelques poissons



vi
d'importance commerciale: Les ombres, les capitaines, les
barracudas et les sardines. La communautA des selaciens regroupe
les bremes, une vari&t6 de requins et des raies et des
maqueraux.
3.3.7   I1 nly a pas de reciEs de corail en Cote d'Ivoire.
3.4     Environnement humain
3.4.1    La commune de Jacqueville est situee a lest d'Abidjan
et s'Otend d'Addah a l'ouest du Canal de Vridi. Addah se situe
au nord du champ. La commune est constitu6e de sept villages et
recense approximative 30 000 habitants. La population se compose
essentiellement d'Alladjans, d'Abizis et d'Akouris, d'une main
d'ouevre provenant d'une autre partie de la COte d'Ivoire et
d'6migr&s des pays voisins (le Ghana, le Benin, le Burkina Faso,
le Mali etc.). Une partie de cette population slest consacr&e
aux activit6s de la pdche tandis quIune autre partie constitue
la main d'oeuvre dans les plantations de palmiers et de
cocotiers.
3.4.2   Deux petits villages Pedeka at Ako, pr&s de la Lagune
Ebri6 A l'ouest du Canal de Vridi ont une population de moins de
50 habitants chacim. Deux autres hameaux, Brakre et Vridi,
comptant au mains 200 habitants se situent a 3,5 km et 5 km de
la mer. Cette r6gion est notaiment constituee d'exploitations de
cocotiers et de la foret preservee de Vridi. Un chemin
sablonneux traverse la zone de l'est & l'ouest. La zone
industrielle de Vridi est limit6e &A llest par de modernes
quartiers r6sidentiels et au sud par un village sans
infrastructure datant des annees 1950.
3.4.3    Une zone industrielle se situe a& loest du Canal de
Vridi. Cette zone poss&de une activitb industrielle et une
infrastructure-p&troli#re impressionnantes. La SIR (Societe
Ivoirienne de Raffinage) dispose d'une raffinerie et EECI
(Energie Electrique de COte df'Ivoire) dispose d'une station
thermique. L'industrie avoisinante est nombreuse et variee:
minoterie, industrie chimique, verrerie etc.
3.4.4    Le commerce de la peche est 1'e6lement le plus important
de 1' conomie de la C8te d'Ivoire. L' l6ment marin environnant
est poissonneux, grace aux courants marins et aux systime
jaillants et la pr6sence de pecheurs migrateurs enthousiastes en
est un temoignage. La lagune Ebri6 est 6galement productive et
pourrait 1 'tre davantage si la pollution pouvait etre contr8l6e
et r6duite.

4.       IMPACTS
4.1     Mfthodologie
4.1.1    Toute relation de cause A effet significative a 6te
analysee au moyen des composants suivants:
- activit6, action ou operation,
- impact (cause),
- objectif,
- effet,
- nature d'effet (positif ou negatif),
- probabilite de r6alisation,
- gravitd (utilite) des effets,
- besoin de mesures coi-rectives,
- description des mesures correctives necessaires,
- remarques (information du contenu).
4.1.2    Toutes les relations ont ete presentees sous forme de
fiches distinctes. L'utilisation d'un fichier est d'assurer
1'analyse solide. Les impacts les plus importants sont seulement
signales dans ce chapitre.
4.2     Impacts  ositifs
4.21     Environnement atmosuh6riaue
4.21.1  Du point de vue de 1'environnement, le gaz naturel est
une source d'l.nergie faisable avec une technologie applicable.
Remplacer cd'huile par le gaz naturel fera diminuer la pollution
de 1' air en C8te d'Ivoire fnorm6ment. La reduction estimee des
6missions de CO2 sont de 50 % et des emisSions de 'NO de 70 %
lans la phase de combustion en comParaison avec l'utilisation de
l'huile.
4.22     Environnement humain    -
4.22.1   Le projet ne cr6era pas de nouveaux travails, du fait
que la plupart des employes sera licenci6e de la production
d'energie presente. NManmoins, il r6side la necessit6 de faire
appel a 150 travailleurs lors de la construction de la plate-
forme situ6e a distance du rivage ainsi qua 50 travailleurs pour
la construction d'une station sur le rivage. Ceci entrainera
aussi une nouvelle technologie et une competence qui auront un
impact positif sur le developpement de la COte d'lvoire.
4.23     Autres impacts _ositifs
4.23.1   L'utilisation du gaz naturel r6duira l'importation de
l'huile consid6rablement. Le gisement du gaz Foxtrot, selon les



viii
estimations, produira du gaz durant 18,5 ans au moins d'apr&s
les previsions de la consommation d'Inergie.
4.3      Risgues des impacts nkratifs
4.31     Environnnement terrestre
4.31.1   I1 n'existe pas de risques majeurs concernant
ltenvironnement terrestre. La construction du gazoduc sur le
rivage et de l'unit6 de traitement de gaz pxovuqueront une
erosion et une perte du sol dans cette r6gion. Animaux
domestiques, v&g6tation et dunes seront perturbes en
consequence.
4.31.2   La destruction non-contr8lee d'emballages vides, de
barrils d'huile, de solvants, etc. durant le fonctionnement
routinier de la station donnera lieu a des risques de pollution,
ceux ci affectant la sant6.
4.32     Environnement marin
4.32.1   Les risques majeurs encourus par lenvironnement marin
(e.g. invert6br6s benthique, planctons, poissons, oiseaux de
mer, mammif&res marins et flore) peuvent resulter de
1'6clatement accidentels des fluides, des fuites de gaz et de
d6versement d'huile et de produits chimiques toxiques.
4.32.2   Le trafic des bateaux peut causer un risque d'accidents
par la pollution de lbhulle et par le d6versement de fuel et .de
lubrifiants.
4.32.3   Les operations de dragage,-de labourage, et
d' aspiration dans l'installation de la pipe-line ainsi que
l'accumulation de la boue et des d6bris des forages resultant
des operation de forages peuvent causer une fuite des min#raux,
un manque d'oxygene et une turbitude tr6s haute. Ceci peut avoir
comme consequence la degradation de la flare et faune marine.
4.33     Environnement atmosph6riaue
4.33.1   Remplacer l'huile par le gaz naturel r6dlira d'une
mani&re spectaculaire la masse polluante actuelle A un niveau
national. Cependant en bralant des hydrocarb,nes et la
generation de 1' nergie, il s'ensuivra des 6missions d'air
continues de SO., CO2 et NO.. L'etission de CO2 contribuera a
produire un effet de serre, l'6mission de NO, et SO2 causera une
contamination atmosphtrique et une acidification du sol et de
l'eau.



ix
4.34    Environnement humain
4.34.1   En comparaison avec d'autres fuels, le gaz est et
demeurera capricieux. Les fuites de gaz incontr6lees, les feux
et les explosions peuvent causer de graves blessures et des
pertes de vies humaines par la meme entralner une perte
mat6rielle, tels que les edifices et 6quipement.
4.34.2   Une trop forte dose de chlorine dans le traitement de
l'eau potable, les monte-charge d6fectueux lors du levage
d'objets etc. mettent en danger la vie des employers.
4.34.3   Le niveau du bruit dl aux systemes electrique et
thermique provoquera en cas extreme la perte de 1louie, un
affaiblissement visuel et augmentera le taux des accidents.
4.34.4   La plate-forme est bonne pour la peche et il attirera
les bateaux de peche. Des problemes entre le personnel de la
plate-forme et les pecheurs peuvent provenir du conflit entre un
desir de securite de la plate-forme d' une part et celui de
possibilies de peche d'autre part.
4.34.5   Les deux villages spontanees sur les rives du Canal de
Vridi se situent A 1'int6rieur des zones protbg&es de lIunite de
traitement de gaz et de la nouvelle station thermique. Bien
qu'il nly ait aucun fondement l6gal pour l'existence de ces
villages, ils posent un probleme d6licat (avec des
considerations sociologiques), ceci demande une manoeuvre
prudente.
4.34.6  Le choix prudent de l'emplacement de l'unit6 de
traitement ne rend pas la migration utile. Dans le cas de la
nouvelle station theznique, la r&alisation de la zone prot&g6e
doit observer le fait qa'il n'exist aucune zone prot6g&e pour la
station thermique actuelle.
4.4     ImDact cumulatif
4.4.1    Le projet a un impact positif sur l'environnement. Les
dangers des impacts n6gatifs peuvent Atre contr8l6s de maniere
efficace.
5.      ANALYSE DES ALTERNATrIvS
5.1      La substitution de l'huile par le gaz naturel reduira
le niveau de la masse polluante lorsqu'elle est comparee a la
situation actuelle. Dans les etudes de faisabilites
pr6liminaires Axito a ft6 nomme en tant qu'alternative de Vridi
pour le remplacement de la nouvelle station. Les alternatives de
Vridi et Azito conviennent egalement du point de vue de
1'environnemer.t.



x
5.2      Si l'alternative de Vridi est choisie, les coMts de
l'investissement sont plus bas en tant que resultat de
I'infrastructure actuelle. Cependant la station actuelle CEECI),
la raffinerie (SIR) et la nouvelle station thermique seront
toutes situ6es limitee A la meme region. Dans le cas d'une
catastrophe, la reserve d'energie de la C6te d'Ivoire peut Stre
serieusement perturbee.
6.       MESURES ATTENUANTES
6.1      Environnement terrestre
6.1.1    Il nly a pas de risques majeurs pour l'environnement
terrestre. Un syst&me de ramassage des d6versements et des
ex,6dents est requis ainsi qu' un controle de la destruction des
emballage chimiques, des barrils, etc. afin d'advenir A la
pollution du sol, des fonds et de la surface de l'eau.
6.2      Environnement marin
6.2.1    Les plus importantes mesures de protection de
1'environnement ma in sont les suivajites:
- Toutes les eaux huileuses doivent 6tre trait6es
s6parfment A plusieurs stades.
- Toute eau violant les limites pH 6 et 8,5 doit etre
neutralis6e.
- A l'6vacuation des dechets, les solides doivent atre
stock6s afin de proc6der a leur dispersion. La
-chlorination ou pr6f6rablement la desinfection UV est
requise seulement si les coliformes ex&dent de
200/100 Mi.
- L'eau us6e des stations du rivage doivent etre
conduites au systbme de canalisation municipal.
- Tout deversement A distance du rivage est interdit.
- De la boue compos6e d'eau ou des boues non-toxiques
devront etre utilis6es lors du forage.
- Une pipe-line souS-marine a besoin d'un couvert de
s6curit6 ou elle doit atre en terr6e au fond-de la mer.
- Des bassins de s6curit6 pour les riservoirs d'huile
et de glycol sont requis.
6.3      Environnement atmosDh6rique
6.3.1    Les risques majeurs pour I' environnement atmosph6rique
proviennent des 6missions CO3 et des 6uissions NO. L'utilisation
du gaz naturel r6duira considerablement les emissions d'air.
6.3.2   I1 n'existe pas de procFde rentable pour r6duire les
6missions. de CO2. Les emissions de NO,-peuvent 4tre reduites au
niveau acceptable par la technique de combustion.



xi
6.4      Environnement humain
6.4.1    L'elimination des risques majeurs de securite requert
les mesures suivants:
- utilisation des huiles qui ne developpent pas de PCB
en brulant,
- installation des syst6mes efficaces de detection de
gaz et de feu,
- un systeme de fermeture d'urgence afin d'isoler les
regions de fuite de gaz,
- utilisation de valves de securit6 et de prevention de
jaillissence afin d'6mpdcher des fuites des gaz lors de
forages,
- un systeme de g6n6rateur d'urgence est requis,
- des r4gles claires pour les operatios d'entretien,
- une systeme d'6vacuation est requis.
6.4.2    Demenagement d'une partie de la population vivant dans
les deux villages spontan6es sur les rives ouest et est du Canal
de Vridi. Ces villages se situent dans des zones proteg6es
(500 m) de l'unit6 du traitement de gaz et de la nouvelle
station thermique. Ceci devrait pouvoir etre a meme de se
r6aliser en informant les gens en avance qu'une autre region
leur est offerte en compensation.
6.5      CoOts c-r6e essentiellement Par la-demande
de ' environnement
6.5.1    Le coflt total estim6s cree par la demande de
l'environnement s'6leve A 2 700 000 dollars E.U. Ceci inclut:
-. e ramassage et le transPort de la boue du forage et
des dechets lors du forage coUte 1 000 000 dollars E.U.
- injection de vapeur afin de r6duire les emissions No.
de la station thermique coOte 1 100 000 dollars E.U.,
- les etudes detaill"es concernant la structure des
sediments du champ cottent 150 000 dollars E.U.,
- la r6installation des gens sur la rive ouest (unite
du traitement du gaz) et sur la rive est (nouvelle
station thermique) du Canal de Vridi coUte 100 000
dollars E.U.,
- les calculs de la dispersion pour la plate-forme et
la station thermique coUtent 40 000 dollars E.U.,
- une recherce geophysique A quelques distances du
rivage coUte 250 000 dollars E.U.,
- les investigations sont recommand6es ainsi que les
mesures concernant l'6rosion sur la c8te ouest de
Vridi, l'estimation des cotts est de 50 000 dollars
E.U.

1.       INTRODUCTION
1.1      The African Development Bank (ADB) and Soil and Water
Ltd in association with Ekono Corporation (team composition in
Annex 1) have signed a consulting agreement for an environmental
study of the exploitation of gas field Foxtrot, Cbte d'Ivoire in
August 1992 (1663d).
1.2      The Bank policy requirns an environmental impact
assessment. The purpose of the EIA-study is to
- analyse and specify environmental impact effects on
the physical, biological and human or animal
environment of the land and in the sea caused by gas
exploitation in offshore and onshore areas,
- prepare mitigative measures and plan for all adverse
effects of activities such as platform construction,
drilling, pipelines, disposal of produced water at the
platform, water and air emissions of the generation
plant,
- examine the existing policy and legislative measures
for mitigating damage to the environment,
- propose alternative approaches and recommend measures
to mitigate the impacts and to define standards for
discharges,
- propose a monitoring plan.
1.3      The EIA-study has been carried out under the
supervision of the Ministry of the Environment of Cote d'Ivoire.
1.4      The list of contacts is shown in Annex 2 and the
references used in Annex 3.
1.5      From an environmental point of view, natural gas is a
feasible energy source with applicable technology. The change
from oil to natural gas will decrease air pollution in the CMte
d'Ivoire remarkably. It will also contribute to the global fight
against the greenhouse effect. The most polluting sources of
energy are oil and charbon coal if proper emission control has
not been implemented.
1.6      Natural gas is a non-renewable source of energy. After
the expected life span of gas field Foxtrot of at least 18.5
years, the technology of the future may be based on so:ar, wind
or wave energy. Today, they are not applicable from a commercial
point of view.

*    EFCoLo(ICA  FRAMEWORK
.1      Sensitivity of ecosystems .o rzerturbat'ofn
.i.1   Humans have become geochemical and bioc-hemical
.anipulators of the environment and have caused some global.
hvanes. Chemical byproducts are changing the atmosphere and the
ydrosphere.
-1.2    Often the most negative aspects of anthropogenic
ffects on ecosystems are not easily recognized. These
-onseauences may not be apparent for some time and thus cause
nd effect may be difficult to relate. The results of subsequent
mpacts may obscure this relationship.
.1-3   The weather pattern is clearly affected by
:ivilization. In the current competition between anthropogenic,
'eocheiuical and biochemical processes, reduction-oxidation
eactions in the atmosphere are disturbed by enhanced
:onsumption rates of fossil fuel. The combustion of these fuels
eads to a disturbance in the electron baiance. A net increase
f acios in atmospheric precipitati-ixon is an inevitable
:onsequence. Furthermore, many potential atmospheric pollutants
.re formed at the same time. These disturbances are transferred
o terrestial, aquatic, estuarine and coastal marine
nvi-ronments.
.1.4    Atmospheric acid deposition creates an additional input
f hydrogen ions, sulphate and nitrate (sulphuric and nitric
-cids) to terrestial and aquatic ecosystems.
.2      Assessment of Pollution
.2.1    A substance introduced into the ecosystem becomes
.ispersed or dilluted. It can become eliminated by adsorption on
*articles or by volatilization. It may also be transformed
:'emicaLly or biologically. The ecological harmfulness bf a
ubstance depends on its interaction with organisms or with
:ommunities of organisms. A contaminant may impair the self
-egulatory functions of the ecosystem or interfere with food                 L
-hains.
.2..    The natural distributiorn of organisms depends primarily
n their ability to compete under given condit^-ns and not
erely on their ability to survive in the physical and chemic.vl
nvironment. A population will be eliminated when its
ompetitive power is reduced to such an extent that it can be
eplaced by other species.
.2.3    As a consequence of the many microhabitats that are
ypically present in a healthy environment, many species can
urvive. Because of interspecies competition, most species are
resent in low population densities. Pollution destroys
icrohabitats, diminishes the chances of survival for some
pecies and thus reduces the competition; the more tolerant
pecies become numerous. This shift in the frequency
istribution of species toward a lower diversity in the
nvironment is a general consequence of harmful impacts.



3
2.3      Consequences
2.3.1    Evaluation of ecological and health effects caused by
exposure to pollutants is extremely difficult due to our limited
knowledge of the impact of harmful substances.
2.3.2    Even if experiments have failed to identify them, all
substances have environmental exposure thresholds below whIch
damage is highly improbable. Thus concern for ecosystem
protection and safety cannot exceed a reasonable cost to benefit
ratio.
2.3.3    The final decision for the balance between ecological
and toxicological measures, economics and the public capacity
for risk acceptance is political, but an environmental impact
assessment procures scientific criteria which greatly aid the
decision-making process.

*    ~POLICY.  EA  AND AflMINTSTRATIV  FRAMFWORK
.i    Applicable legislation
.:.1.   The environmentally applicable legislation is listed in
nnex 4. When evaluating the environmental impact of the Gas
oxt=ot Project, the "Code Petrolier" ( No 70-489, August 3,
S70) is the most important law. The decree 70-528 (September 2,
9'0) determines the modes of application of the 'Code
etrolier".
.2     Environmental policy
.2.1   The "Ministere de 1'Environnement, de la Construction
t de l'Urbanisme" is responsible for preparing the government's
nvironmental program which contains a national viewpoint on all
nvironmental issues. It is also responsible for defining
uidelines for a national environmental policy. These tasks are
fltrusted to the "Direction de l'Environnement" and to the
Direction de ltAssainissement". The tasks in details are as
ollows:
- management and development of natural resources,
- public health and sanitation,
- urban and rural lifestyles,
- sost energy paths and alternative technology,
- legal aspects and decentralized cooperation,
- sensitization and environmental multisectorial
cooperatives.
.2.2   Today there is some movement towards improving
nvironmental activities. The "Ministere de l'Environnement, de
a Construction et de l'Urbanismes is preparing an Environment
ode, which will bring together and complement the existing
ieces of law related to the environment. The Environment Code
-ill come into force possibly in a few years time. French and
nternational law will be used as examples, but the ideas will
*e adapted to the conditions in COte d'Ivoire.
.2.3   All the ministries in charge of key sectors in the
-conomy of the country can offer an environmental preservation
rogra me, but they do not have the necessary means to support a
ustainable development in the field bf ecology.
.3     Use of natural resrces and indutrial activities
.3.1    These laws mainly concern economic issues and they say
ittle about environmental matters.
.3.2    The exploitation of natural gas in the project Foxtrot
equires the permission of the "Minist6re de l'Industrie, des
Ines et de I'Energie". This Ministry is also in charge of
- the management of industrial environment,
- the recovery and upgrading of industrial wastes,
- the enforcement of regulation in all registered
industries and the implementation of efforts to
minimize industrial pollution and nuisance within such
units.

3.3.3    These activities are coordinated by the "Direction de

4.       PROJECT DESCRIPTION
4.1      Backgound
4.1.1    The production of electricity has declined during the
last decade. This is due to many factors. The hydraulic reserves
have been depleted as a result of many dry years. The ageing of
production facilities has decreased the yield and availability
of energy resources. The need to import leads to increased
costs. Taking the present economic recession into account, these
are significant problems attached to the domain of energy.
4.1.2    The development of the natural gas field of Foxtrot
provides a good opportunity for a cost effective energy source.
4.1.3    The verified capacity of 15 milliard cubic metres
(15 Gm3) makes it possible to fullfil the needs of the
production of electricity for a period of at least 18.5 years.
The assumed hydroelectric power is 1000 ...1200 GWh/a and the
forecasted thermal power increases from 1220 G1h/a in 1994 to
2070 GWh/a in 2010.
4.2      General descri_tion
4.2.1    The natural gas field of Foxtrot is located on the
continental shelf of the COte d'Ivoire (Fig. 4.1), about 80 km
SW from Abidjan. The field has been discovered by Phillips
Petroleum in 1981-82.
4.2.2    The development of the Foxtrot field-requires the
utilization of a production platform, which is planned to be
installed at the water depth of 102 m. The natural gas produced
through the wells is treated by a three-stage separator
resulting in gas, condensates and water. The gas and the
condensates are reunited after dehydration and transported via a
submarine gas pipeline.
4.2.3    The gas pipeline is planned to end in a treatment plant
located west from the Canal de Vridi near Abidjan (Fig. 4.2).The
gas and the condensates are once again separated prior to their
own distribution.
4.2.4    The gas is planned to be delivered to a new thermal
power plant of Vridi (EECI or Energie Electric de la COte
d'Ivoire: production of electricity) and its extensions to the
SIR (Socit6 Ivoirienne de Raffinage: oil refining) through an
underground gas pipeline. The pipeline goes under Canal de
Vridi. The condensates are also led to SIR in a separate oil
pipeline.

4.3      Gas wells
4.3.1    The gas wells Bl-lX and B1-2X (Fig. 4.1), drilled in
1981-82 by Phillips Petroleum, are 2734 and 3658 m deep,
respectively. Petroci drilled a confirmation well, Foxtrot 1
(F1), in 1990 and carried out test pumpings.
4.3.2    On the basis of test pumpings, seismic measurements and
other information, it has been estimated, that four wells
(Foxtrot 1 and three others) were suff2..ient to assure the
adequate production of natural gas. Three new gas wells have to
be drilled in different places of the field by using a semi-
submersible platform before the installation of the production
platform (Fig. 4.3).
4.4      Platform
4.4.1    The platform will be equiped to produce, separate and
dehydrate a gas flow of 750 million m3/a (2.4 million m3/d). The
production of condensates is about 160 n3/d (70 me condensates/
1 million m3 of gas).
4.4.2    The gas has to be dehydrated before the transportation
via a gas pipeline in order to avoid the formation of hydrates
and to protect the pipe against corrosion. In the same way water
will be separated from the condensate before the reinjection
into the transportation line.
4.4.3    The platform will be furnished with accomodation and
other facilities to allow a 24h supervision. Fire fighting and
other security equipment will be installed too.
4.5      Submarine L as DijDline
4.5.1    A submarine gas pipeline, which connects the platform
to the treatment unit on land, will be 82 km long and has an
external diameter of 12 3/4" (about 320 mm).
4.5.2    The pipeline will be protected by a concrete cover,
which also anchors the pipe. A station to launch a scraper will
be installed on the platform and similarly a reception station
on the treatment unit. This allows the frequent cleaning up of
the gas pipe.
4.5.3    The gas pipeline will be buried in the earth and in the
surf area via a tunnel and the same system will be needed when
passing the Canal de Vridi.

4.6      Gas treatment Plant
4.6.1    The aas treatment unit is needed to separate the gas
from the condensates, to stabilize the condensates, to treat and
measure the gas flow and to control all the production
operations.
4.6.1    The plug stock of tne condensates corresponds a
production of ten days.
4.6.2    The underground gas pipeline from the treatment unit to
the electric power plant (about 1 km from the dispatching point)
and its extensions has a diameter of 14' (350 mm). Another
pipeline crossing the Canal de Vridi conducts the condensates in
a 4" (100 mm) pipe to the refinery of the SIR (about 4 km from
the dispatching point).
4.6.3    Two delivery stations at the clients' gates are equiped
with pressure control devices.
4.7      New thermal mower plant
4.7.1    Because the project-development is in an early stage,
no documentation was available about the new thermal power
plant. The type of the plant will be combined cycle power plant.
4.7.2    Its presumed capacity was reported to be 120...150 MW.
The first phase (one turbine) will provide a capacity of
40.. .50 Mg (stepwise investment program).
4.7.3    The plant will use natural gas as the primary energy
source, but it will also be able to use heavy vacuum oil when
required. Cooling water will be taken from the Canal de Vridi,
chlorinated and returned to the channel.
4.7.4    The expected flue gas and cooling water fiow will be
1170 t/h and 21000 tfh (for three turbines), respectively. The
height of the chimney will be 25 m.
4.8      Overview
4.8.1    In Aunex 5, there are photographs showing the present
conditions in the project area.

*BASELTNE DATA
Locat'n
.1.1   The area of the development of gas field Foxtrot runs
O km westward from the Canal de Vridi, near Abidjan to the
-lllage of Addah and seaward to the c. 100 m contour line, whic.h
_es approximately 15 km offshore.
.2     Climat
..2.1   The climate in C8te d'Ivoire is sub-equatorial and
iumid. The atmospheric humidity in the coastal area is in
tverage 86 %. In the Vridi area the humidity does not go below
6 %. Minimum humidity is from 31 % in December to 65 % in
)Ctober. In the coastal zone of C6te d'Ivoire the rainy season
;tarts in March and lasts until middle of July. A short dry
season, 4 - 6 weeks long, follows. A short showery season starts
-n the middle of September and lasts until November. A long dry
;eason called "la grande saison s&chet starts in December and
asts until March.
'.2.2   The annual rainfall varies from 35 mm in February to
90 mm in June. Annual rainfall can exceed 2000 m  and there may
)e as many as 150 wet days a year.
- .2.3    Annual temperatures vary between 21°...29°C (25°C on
iverage).
.2.4    The winds in the Abidjan area are mostly southernly,
;outhwesternly and southeasternly. The fresh, dry 1 'armattan
:ind blows from the north east each year r'etween December and
ebruary. The coastal zone is influenced by sea breezes. The
iverage wind velocity is 2 mIs. The maximum wind velocities were
iuring the years 1961 - 1975 between 15 - 27 m/s (mostly
lortheasternly, easternly and southeasternly). A stormy period
ccurs during July - August every year. Severe tropical storms
rith exceptionally high wave conditions (4...5 a) occur about
-nce every 20 years.
i.2.5    Air emissions in C8te dtIlvoire originate from industry,
-raffic and bush fires. The contribution of COte d'Ivoire to
-egional or global emissions is low. Problems are mainly met on
. local scale in Abidjan. The amounts and sources of the main
ollutants in Abidjan are presented in Table 3.1. In Abidjan
-here is no monitoring of air quality. There is neither any
-egulations or norms for air pollution in Cote d'Ivoire.

5.3      TerrestrZial en-vironment
5.31
5.31.1   The coastal zone from Addah to Abidjan consist of
barrier lagoon system composed of Quaternary sands. The coastal
barrier-lagoon zone is low-lying and narrow with maximum
elevation of not more than 3 meters above sea level. The
barrier-lagoon system is backed by Tertiary continental
plateaus.
5.31.2   There is only little information available about the
seismic activity in COte d'Ivoire. The geophysical station L30TO
(established 1962) has measured in average 2000 vibrations
annually. These vibrations are mostly distant. At least three
stronger earthquakes of magnitude 6 (Richters scale 0... 10) has
been measured (1939 in Ghana, 1971 in the Gulf of Guinea and
1983 in Guinea). The vibrations are in the southern part of COte
d'Ivoire mostly 2t.. .4 of in magnitude on the Richters scale.
5.32     lntertidal, shoreline.   a n and wetlmads
5.32.1   The ocean shore lies on an well-developed sand spit, up
o 8 km wide. The, spit is covered by natural vegetation,
extensive commercial coconut piantations and small gardens. The
~spit is backed by the Lagune Ebrir  and encloses wetlands and
some smaller pure freshwater lakes of importance to the ground
water supply e.g. Lac Brakr&. These lakes are quite close to the
proposed site of the gas treatment plant. The water table is
here very shallow.
5.32.2   The shores in the Addah-Abidjan area are exposed open
sand beaches, typical of the Gulf of Guinea. They receive the
full force of ocean swell. The amplitude of the breaking waves
usually exceeds the range of the tide, so wave action is
important in determining the vertical organism zonation.
5.32.3   The beaches between Canal de Vridi and Addah form the
northern boundary to the marine area under investigation. They
face almost the south. The surface of the beach area in Vridi
consists of coarse grained sand and inland the deposits are of



17
:layey coarse grained sand. The ground deeper consiSts of humid
:oa-se grained sand.
-.32.4  The backshore community is stabilised by vegetation,
3articularly coconut and creepers. The shores themselves are
;teep and narrow with a slope of approximately 1:10 near
7acaueville and 1:7 near Addah.
.32.5  Marine macrophytes are virtually absent and the flora
-s restricted for the most part to diatoms cast up by the waves.
)ccasionally detached macro-flora may be washed up, but this
soon desiccates. Sea grasses were not found.
3-32.6   The upper shore is characterised by populations of
;host crabs, Ocypoda species (Ocypoda cursor and Ocypoda
kfricana). At the lower shore there is a population of Donax sp.
3nd Cerastoderma whose shells are cast up by the waves. Numbers
3f Physalia physalis and cuttle bones were cast up along with a
rariety of flotsam including -u few small tar plaques. A midshore
,and profile revealed no sulphide layer or water table above
m.
3.32.7   The Lagune Ebri6 is the most seriously polluted lagoon
.n COte d'Ivoire. The lagoon is an important area of fish and
shrimp reproduction. it is an essential habitat for numerous
SDecies of fish - especially in the winter time - and habit-t
for palearctic bird migrants. The lagoon is bordered by
narshlands of sweet water and mangroves. The water region is
_nfluenced in a combined way both maritime and continental
craters. Water is saltier in the dry period than in the wet
,eriod.
5.32.8   The major threats to the lagoon are municipal and
industrial waste waters and agricultural activities. Lagune
Ebri4 is without any doubt the most seriously polluted lagoon in
8te d'Ivoire.
5.4      Marine environment
5.41     Sediment        lations         rohology
5.41.1   The COte d'Ivoire sedimentary basin is developed along
the West-Africa coast from Liberia to Ghana. Its onshore
expression is limited, but the sedimentary accumulations expands
south of the East-West trending 'Lagunes fault' on the Abidjan
liargin and south of the Northeast-South west trending "Saint
Paul fault' on its western part. Total area of the basin is
7000 km2. Up to 10 000 metres of sediments are accumulated in the
oasin in shallow to moderate water depths. The continental shelf
slopes gradually away from the shore at a gradient of
approximately 1:150. The sedimentary deposits consists mainly of
sandstones, siltstones and shales.
5.41.2   The surface sediments on the seafloor vary from coarse
sand to fine mud. Two rocky ridges 300 m and 400 m long rises to
a height of between 4 m and 8 m.



18
5.42     Oil and gas exoloitation
5.42.1   Hydrocarbon research has been carried out in Cote
d'Ivoire since the beginning of 20th century. Two oil fields and
two gas accumulations have been discovered offshore C8te
d'Ivoire (before 1990). The oil field offshore Grand-Bassam is
the only one left, and the closing of this field is likely in
the near future. Numerous exploration wells have yielded
significant hydrocarbon shows. Most of the good hydrocarbon
reservoirs occur in the Albien, Cenomanien and Campanian
sediments (Fig. 5.1).
5.42.2   Foxtrot gas field was discovered 1981. The water depth
is 90.. .100 m over the center of the field. Hydrocarbons occur
in Upper Albien sandstones lying at depths approximately
2100.. .2500 m below sea level. The cap of the gas reservoir is
situated in the Cenomanien formation at a depth of 2176 m. The
size and shape is controlled by post-Albien unconfor_ity. It is
cut by four major NW-SE trending faults which are downthrowing
to the south (Fig 5.2).
5.43     Water depth and seawater conditions
5.43.1   The COte d'Ivoire sedimentary basin has its extension
offshore where the continental shelf is about 25.. .30 km wide.
The continental slope begins at a water depth of about 130...150
m- The water depth varies from 0 m in the coastal zone to 105 m
at the platform.
5.43.2   The seawater temperature is 27°C at the surface,
15... 20°C at 20 m and 10°'C at 100 m during the coldest period
June-September.
5.34.4   The salinity varies between 33.5 parts per thousand at
the surface to 35.5 parts per thousand at 20 m during the same
period.
5.44     Effects of Currents. Waves and Tides
5.44.1   Where the sea level intersects the continental margin,
physical, chemical and biological procrsses are of high
intensity. Currents, waves and tides show maximum intensity too.
5.44.2   The warm eastward flowing "Guinea current" washes the
shores at an average surface speed of 0.3...1.1 m/s. Its effects
reach depths of between 20 and 50 M. A feeble undercurrent the
Olvoirien", flows in the opposite direction at a speed of
0.3.. .0.7 m/s. This is recorded in the 15.. .80 m zone.
5.44.3   Tides are semidiurnal, the lowest low waters occur at
night between April and September. They occur from October to
March in the morning. The tidal ranges are small, up to 2 m at
springs and up to 1 m at neaps resulting in a mean tidal range
of about 1.5 m.

5.44.4   A characteristic Atlantic swell affects the region with
a wave height of between 1.. .1.8 m. Waves occur roughly at
10 ...11 second intervals. The strongest swell occurs between May
and August.
5.44.5   Sea level is the baseline of erosion and deposition.
Exposed areas erode, submerged areas are built. Coastal erosion
is very common in the eastern coastal zone from Grand Lahou to
the Ghanian border. The coastal erosion is typical in the areas
of coastal barrier-lagoon systems. The coastal erosion is in
places in the area Addah-Abidjan in on average 1.5...2.5 meters
per year. The westward flowing Guinea current previously carried
sediments to the beaches of the area, and continues to do so
west of the Canal de Vridi, where the sediment load is estimated
to be c. Boo 000 m3/year. There is acretion of sand immediately
west of the Canal de Vridi. The mole at the opening of the canal
now diverts these sediments into the "Trou-sans-fond".
5.45     Sub-littoal and benthos
5.45.1   Flora in the sublittoral is represented by the micro-
algae of the plankton and occasional detached floating micro-
algae.
5.45.2   The invertebrate fauna relate to depth and substrate:
above the 35 m contour line it is possible to distinguish three
groups of bentbic organisms; those frequenting either sand or
mud and those which tolerate both. These species are not found
in water cooler than 17aC.
5.45.3   Many benthic species are unaffected by seasonal
changes, but the 17°C isotherm, which shifts between 60 and
100 m, according to the time of year, appears to be critical.
This isotherm separates those coastal species which require
higher temperatures, yet can tolerate the varying salinities
typical of coastal waters, from the deeper shelf populations,
which can survive only in lower temperatures, while requiring
constant salinities in the region of 35 parts per thousand. More
details are given in the Annex 6.
5.45.4   Fish fauna can be broadly divided into 'wo communities.
The first 50 m of the water column are populated by the Sciaenid
community comprising several families notably the Sciaenidae
themselves, Pomadazidae, Polinemidae, Drepanidae and the
Clupeidae. This community includes some important commercial
fish: ombres, capitaines, barracudas and sardines.
5.45.5   The Sparid community develops below 50 m. This includes
a wide range of families and species many of which are of
commercial importance notably the breams (Sparidae, including
dorades and pageots), various sharks and rays, groupers
(Serranidae), dentex and mackerel. Further specialised elements
exist in the deep shelf community and the continental slope
community, see Annex 6.

:t found nei-:her in the site area nor in CMte d'Ivoire.
.       Human environmsfL
.51     Jacaueville and Environs
.51.1   The commune of Jacqueville is situated west of Abidjan
nd has its extension from Addah to west of the Canal de Vridi.
ldah is situated north of the gas field. The commune consists
f seven villages and has an estimated population of 30 000
abitan.ts (1988). Jacqueville was originally populated by three
=hnical groups: Ahizis, Alladjans and Akouris or Avicanes. The
Iladjans are the major group with 27 % of the population and
riey own the fishing water near the beach. The Ahizis and the
kouris have fishing areas on the lagoon side. During 1975 and
988, the commune showed an annual growth rate of 8.13 %. The
.gh growth of the population is due to three elements namely:
- high birthrate due to very young population
- influx of lbour from other part of CMte d'Ivoire,
due to the establishement of a copra factory in
Jacqueville
- i.mmigration from neighbouring countries: Ghana,
Benint Burkiina Faso, Mali etc. One part of this
population is involved in fishing activities in the
lagoon (Lagne Ebrid) and in rhe sea, the other part
constitute a labour force in coconut and palm oil
plantations. Commercial activitier, are the domain for
NJigerians.
.52     Vridi canal en3iron
.52.1   Two small villages, Pedeka and Ako, near the Lagune
brie west of Canal de Vr'di have each a populaticn at least 50
nhabitants.
.52.2   Two other hamlets, Brakr6 and Vridi, with at least 200
nhabitants each are situated 3,5 km and 5 kmI near the sea, west
f Canal de Vridi. This area is covered by coconut farms and
ridi's preserved forest. There is an unmetalled track, which
-osses the zone from east to west.
.52.3   There have also been some experiments to culture manioc
n small parcels between the coconut farm areas and bush
crests.
.52.4   The industrial zone in Vridi has been limited since
950's by a spontar.ecus village with approximately 0DO0
nhabitants in the south and by modern resedential quarters in
he east.



22
5.6       anal de Vridi and boat traffic
5.6.1    The channel "Canal de Vridi" was built in 1950 in order
to allow shipping access to Abidjan. The. canal connects the
Atlantic Ocean with Lagune Ebrie. The channel has a NW - SE
orientation. Canal de Vridi is about 3 km 'ong, 370 m wide and
with a maximum depth of 15 m. To prevent erosion the canal
bottom is covered by steel net and both sides of the canal are
covered by stone boulders and the ends with tetrapods.
5.6.2    Suction dredging operations has to be made annually in
the canal, due to the sediment loads from the Lagune Ebrie. The
dredgings are transported in a barge and dumped offshore.
5.6.3    In the channel the tide has an yearly maximum amplitude
of 1.2 m (high water 1.8 m and low water 0.6 mi).
5.6.4    The traffic via the "Canal de Vridi" plays an important
role when developing the gas project. The channel is the only
route to the harbour of Abidjan. The annual traffic across the
"Canal de Vridi" is about 250...-3000 ships including the
traffic to Port de Peche (trawlers, tuna and other fishing
boats). In 1991 381 petroleum ships passed via the canal.
5.6.5    The shiplanes to the channel have directions of 2978 and
304°. The maximum speed for the ships in the canal is 10 knots.
An anchoring area for ships is situated east of the canal.
5.7      Fishery
5.7.1    In principle the marine fishery is divided into the
ollowing zones:
f from the shoreline to one mile eastward - artisanal
fishery usiag small craft working from the beaches,
- from one mile to six miles - area open to larger
commercial Ivoirien vessels,
- from six miles to 200 miles out - exclusive economic
zone.
5.7.2    The distinction between these zones is blurred and
abuses occur often. There is no effective way to enforce them.
5.7.3    The fishery consists, due to the rich fauna, of small-
scale fishing and trawling developed by the populations in the
villages in the coastal zone and occasionally sport fishing.
5.7.4    All fishing activities are carried out by foreigners.
The Ghanaians are fishing in the coastal spit between the Canal
de Vridi and the village of Addah. Malians and Beninois has
Lagune Ebri6 as their fishing a  ea.
5.7.5    Generally, fishermen from Benin and Mali are self-
employed and owning their equipments. The Ghanians are organized



23
i cooperation and work for five years sharing the expenses and
-ofits. They live with their families in temporary villages
-ong the coast and return to their country after five years
)rk for a three months vacation.
.71    Commercial Fishers
.71.1   Commercial fishing is the most important element in the
:onomy of the C8te d'Ivoire. The revenues of the Port of
3idjan depend considerably on fish landings and processing. In
)91 _4,974 tonnes was landed. The fishery is divided up into
ie following elements:
- Shrimp and other brackish fish taken from the Lagune
Ebri6. This fishery is -carried out mainly by Beninois,
Malians etc. working from small canoes. In 1991 the
catch figure was 189 tonnes for shrimps and 594 tonnes
for fish, total 738 tonnes (2.23 %) of the national
catch for the year.
- Trawling for demersal fish over the entire
continental shelf at depths of 200 m and more. Here
about 15 trawlers of up to 30 m are used. They are run
by 8 companies working out of Abidjan. In 1991 these
trawlers accounted for 4,405 tonnes (12.59 %) of the
total national catch. These craft are theoretically
prohibited from fishing within one mile of the coast in
the zone limited to J.he artisanal fishery.
- Sardine are fished at sea by 20 special boats. They
are owned by 9 companies and work on horizontal fronts
between warmer and cooler water. The annual catch in
1991 was 29,787 tonnes (85.16 %)
- Tuna and related fish, taken at sea by special boats
working on horizontal fronts between warmer and colder
water where plankton and sardines abound. These fronts
may lie inside or outside the six mile limit. This is
the only fishery which appears to have an inspectorate
and it supports an important canning and export
industry. Little tuna, various carangdis, Scomber
japonicus and Brachydeuterus auritus are taken. A six
mile zone is theoretically restricted to Ivoirien
fishermen and tax paying foreign nationals. In 1991
47,248 tonnes of canned tuna were exported from the
Cote d'Ivoire, mainly to European countries.
.71.2   A six mile zone is theoretically restricted to Ivoirien
ishermen and tax paying foreign nationals.
.72    Artisanal Fishery
.72.1   An artisanal fishery exists up to one mile out from the
aore. On the coastal spit between the Canal de Vridi and the
illage of Addah this is almost exlusively exploited by-
aanaians. About 100 such boats, 14.. .18 m in length, fish in
ais zone which is prohibited to larger vessels. The boats are



24
worked without power, being rowed by a crew of around 18 men.
They use seine nets with sectioned purses to encircle fish.
Various species are caught, a small proportion is sold in the
villages, the balance being marketed in Abidjan. Small fishes
are kept back for smoking in the villages prior to sale in the
city.
5.72.2   Turtles are taken from time to time.
5.72.3   The artisanal fishery is unselective, a wide range of
species being taken, the most significant elements are listed in
Annex 6.
5.72.4   The FAO Fisheries Catch Statistics (1988 data published
in 1990) states that there is no catch assessment survey for
marine and inland artisanal fisheries.
5.73     Fish farms
5.73.1   There are two fish farms in the Jacqv:eville area. One
is private and is run by the Socift6 Ivorienna d'Aquaculture
Lagunaire (S.I.A.C.) and the other is state run in association
with the Centre for oceanographic Research in Abidjan (C.R.O.).
The first raises and fattens marichions using its own breeding
stock. Over a million fish are'raised annually with a high
maturation rate (95 %). The second rears marichions, siluries
and carps.
5.74     S20u fi ishing
5.74.1   Several species of sport fish are taken in the region,
notably blue marlin and sailfish.
5.75     Futlne trends
5.75.1   There is no doubt that the Cote d'Ivoire has great
fisherY resources. The marine element is rich in fish, due to
the prevailing current and upwelling systems, and the
enthusiastic migrant element in the workforce is a testimony to
this. The Lagune Ebrie is also productive and could produce more
so if the pollution currently polluting the Abidjan district
could be controlled and reduced.
5.8      Industry
5.8.1    An industrial zone is situated east of Canal de Vridi.
This zone has impressive industrial activity and petroleum
infrastructure. The SIR (Socift6 Ivoirienne de Raffinage)
dispose a refinery and EECI (Energie Electrique de C6te
d'Ivoire) dispose a thermal power plant. Neighboiring industry
is numerous and various:
- COSMIVOIRE (oil mill and soap factory),
- UTEXI (textile industry),
- CIBA GEIGY, UNION CARBIDE (chemical industry),
- CHOCODI (cacao prosessing factory),
- TOLIVOIRE (steel plate factory).

IMPACTS
; 1   As a result of the various necessary activities,
-.ions and operations (e.g. drilling), a certain cause and
ffect relationship (e.g. risk of escape of drilling mud causing
3isoning of marine fauna by toxic substances) is generated. If
ais is an unacceptable situation from an environmental point of
iew, a mitigative measure (e.g. use of water based muds) is
aquired.
.1.2    Every significant cause and effect relationship has
aen analysed by means of the following components:
- activity, action or operation,
- impact (cause),
- target,
- effect,
- nature of effect (positive/negative),
- probability of realisation,
- seriousness/usefulness of effects,
- need for mitigati-'e measures,
- description of required mitigative measure,
- remarks (background information).
.1.3    All analysed relationships have been presented as
eparate cards in Annex 7. The use of card format is to ensure
ound analysis.
1.4    The most important impacts only, as well as all
equired mitigative measures have been presented in chapters 6
nd 8, respectively. Consequently, in this approach, the most
mportant conclusions are clearly presented and the necessary
ustification for the decision making process is guaranteed.

.21    Hell fiatfo=
.211    Marine environmeLt
.211.1  Accidental fluid blowouts from a well can destroy a
hole platform and will pollute the nearby marine and shore
nvironment. Blowouts are caused by abnormal pressure in the
eservoir, which is released during drilling.
.211.2 Boat traffic creates a risk of accidents and oil
ollution and spillage of fuel and lubricants. This can disturb
articularly plankton and other marine animals as a result of
mothering benthos and polluting seawater. Road traffic will
ncrease as well as sea traffic thus endangering the terrestial
nvironment as well.



26
6.211.3  Benthic invertebrates, plankton and fish suffer from:
- accumulation of mud, chemicals and drill cuttings on
the sea bottom (smothering),
- discharge of oil and chemicals containing waters
(toxic effect),
- release of chlorine and heat in the discharge of
cooling water,
- discharge of sewage from the platform and the
operating vessels,
- release of toxic chemicals as a result of antifouling
measures on submarine structures.
6.212    Atmospheric environment
6.212 1  Burning hydrocarbons in the torch and generation of
power by gas turbines or diesel engines will result in
continious air emissions of CO2 and NO,. CO2 will contribute to
the greenhouse effect, NO and SO2 will cause air pollution,
acidification of soil and water and possible damage to flora.
However, it is most important to remember that replacing oil by
natural gas will dramatically reduce the present national level
of pollutant loading.
6.212.2 The level of noise due to power and steam generation
systems, drilling, mud pumping etc. may lead in extreme cases to
loss of hearing, lowered visual activity and increased accident
rates. Other sources of noise are due to boat and helicopter
traffic.
6.213    Hun Ian  L X  
6.213.1 Fires and explosions can result in injury and loss of
human life as well as damage to plant and structures. -The
effects may be direct or indirect (e.g. fires may indirectly
lead to toxic PCB emissions from transformer and capacitor
oils). The risk of fires and explosions may result from the
following list of identified risks:
- use of inert gas (usually nitrogen) to purge
hydrocarbons from tanks and other devices,
- uncontrolled gas escapes from the gas treatment unit,
- hydrogen generation when cbarging batteries,
- hydrocarbon escapes while carrying out rutine
maintenance operations such as welding,
- gas leakage due to platform heeling caused by the
subsidence of uppermost layers of sea bottom sediments.
6.213.2 People working on the platform may be accidentally
exposed to the following risks:
- overdose of chlorine in treatment of potable water.
- acid burns when cleaning batteries,
- defective hoists when lifting objects,
- over filling fuel tanks,
- boat and helicopter accidents.



21
213.3 The platform itself may tempt fishing boats, since fish
ind to congregate near submarine structures, attracted by their
3pography and diversity of food and shelter. The conflict of
:_erest between platform safety on one hand, and fishing
aportunities on the other har.d, may lead to trouble between
-atformr personnel and fishermen and end anger both groups.
.22    Submarine -pineline
.221    Marine environment
.221.1 Geophysical surveys are required especially for the
istallation of the pipeline, but alz-i for the platform to avoid
ibsidence of uppermost layers and obstacles on the seabottom.
_.r pressure waves from seismic surveys may temporarily scare
4ay marine mammals, turtles and fish.
.221.2 Dredging, plowing or suction operations in pipeline
:stallation may lead to short term release of nutrients, oxygen
:-arvation and higher turbidity. Such phenomena can result in
aaker sediment stability in the presence of cohesive soils and
ogradation of marine flora and fauna.
221.3  Seismic activity (earthquakes etc.) may cause ruptures
3 pipeline and endanger the platform and the marine
ivironment.
.221.4 Fishing with benthic trawls may damage the pipeline. As .
result of an escape of gas into the sea, hydrocarbons may
issolve and strip out oxygen from seawater killing organisms by
*ygen.starvation. Sea birds may become oiled by heavy
idrocarbon fractions. .
.221.5  The leakages of gas from the pipeline may be due to
3rrosion, construction faults, material failures, damage caused
i outside forces and forces caused by variation in sea bottom
Drphology as well as coastal erosion and sediment transports in
arrents. Structural damage may also be due to wave activity in
aallow water depths, cu=rent activity, seismic activity,
.dflows and soft sedimert composition. Anchroring of ships and
il kind of offshore dumping activities may damage the pipeline.
.221.6 The problems facing benthos, fish populations, sea
;.rds and microflora are decrease in seawater pH, decrease in
vel of dissolved oxygen and poisoning by complex aromatic
,mpounds.
.221.7 Noise from the boat traffic servicing construction and
aintenance of platform may frighten some marine mammals and
irtles away from the area.



28
6.222    Human environment
6.222.1 As a result of accidental gas leaks, navigators and
fishermen risk their lives if a f-re is generated at hot spots
such as ship's engines.
6.23     Onshore aas treatment Rlant
6.231    TerrestriAl environment
6.231    The construction of the plant itself will lead to soil
erosiLon and loss of land area (4,5 ha). This will disturb
domestic animals (loss of grazing area), vegetation (reduced
growth) and fossil dunes (dune movements). Accidental escapes of
chemicals may pollute the soil locally.
6.232    Marine environment
6.232.1 In the operation of the gas treatment plant, there is a
risk of gas, condensates, glycol and other chemical spills from
the process. These discharges can result in direct pollution of
soil and groundwater and surface water. The end result of such
pollution may be a decrease in biodiversity.
6h233    UZSOWhE1C fcnVi1rnAment
6.233.1 The operation of the treatment plant will continuously
produce air emissions of Co2 and NO from the torch. Once again,
we should point out that although 1is will contribute to the
greenhouse effect and acidification, this situation will be far
preferable to the present one.
6.234    Human environment
6.234.1 The spontaneous ('illegal') village west of Canal de
Vridi is partly located in the planned treatment plant area. The
determiantion of the safety zone will result in the displacement
of some of the people. Without any mitigative measures this will
lead to landuse conflicts between villagers and authorities. The
situation may become even worse, if the new personnel of the
plant inhabit the same area.
6.234.2 Other problems related to plant operation (e-g. noise
and gas accidents) are similar to those of the platform. Fires
and explosions caused by accidental gas or condesate spills may
result in injury and loss of life.



29
.24    New Power Plant
-241    Terrestrial environment
241.1 The routine operation of the plant will raise the need
Dr disposal of empty chemical containers, oil barrels, solvents
:c. A non-controlled disposal will lead to pollution, health
izards and loss of land area.
.241.2 When storing and handling chemicals like NaOE, NaClO
id H2SO4, accidental spills can lead to injuries to personnel,
Dcal soil pollution, ground water and surface water with
Dnsequent damage to flora and fauna. Similar conclusions are
alid for oil storage tanks and pipes.
.242    Marine enZironimert
.242.1 Discharge of waters from the paved plant area and from
'e demineralization unit as well as other processed waters
reates a risk of marine pollution and risk to marine flora and
auna.
.242.2 The continuous discharge of chlorinated cooling water
ack into the Canal de Vridi have toxic effects on the marine
lora and fauna and create health hazards via less healthy fish
_ocks. The expected cooling water flow from the power plant
ill be 5,8 m3/s and the ierease in temperature 10 *C. The heat
oad will be reduced by returning the water back to the canal
hrough an open channel. The exact decrease of the temperature
s not possible to say due to lack of detailed design data.
aken into consideration the rather small amount of water and
he size of the Canal de Vrid±, the impacts of the increased
emperature will be restricted to the canal area. Because of the
ature of the Canal de Vridi, there will not be any major
mpacts on fishery or ecology.
.243    AtmosRheric environment
.243.1 The emission level of CO2 when using oil is about
O g/MJ but only about 60 g/KJ when using natural gas. The
fficiency of the production of electricity will rise from the
resent 30 % to approximately 45 % in the new thermal power
lant. These two factors indicate, that the CO2 emissions, which
ontribute to greenhouse effect, will decrease by 50 %P, a major
tep towards an acceptable environment.
.243.2  Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOQ) will be reduced from
he level 150. --500 mg/NJ when using oil to 60 ...200 mg/MJ when
sing gas, thus giving a total decrease of almost 75 % of NO -
missions when the improvement in efficiency is also taken into
ccount. High concentrations of NO way cause direct damages to -
egetation, cause acidification of soil and water. They may also
ause eutrophication of surface waters and formation of ozone
hrough reactions with hydrocarbons. There will be no SO2
missions from the combustion of natural gas of Foxtrot, because
t does not contain any sulphur. There will neither be any dust
missions.



30
6.243.3 The noise level caused by turbines is 85 dB at a
distance of 3 m and 65 dB in the plant area. The new plant will
not increase che present noise level outside the plant area.
Comments given for the platform related to hearing problems are
valid also here.
6.244    Human environment
6.244.1 There exists a similar risk of social conflicts between
illegal inhabitants and authorities as in the case of gas
treatment plant. The same conclusions are relevant here also.

ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATZVES
_ -    Description of alternatives
.1 .1   The following three alternatives create a basis for the
tilization of natural gas. Alternatives based on sources of
nergy ozher than gas are beyond the scope of this work.
- Alternative 0:
Natural gas will not be used as !be energy source, but
the present oil based energy production coupled with
hydropower will remain as it is today.
- Alternative 1:
New power plant utilizing natural gas will be located
in the Vridi Industrial zone.
- Alternative 2:
New power plant utilizing natural gas will be located
in the Azito area.
.;.2    The alternative given in the Terms of Reference-is
-l:ernative 1 (Vridi).

.2.1    Taking into account the most important decision making

++  = positive          =          negative
+   = slightly positive    -   = slightly negative



32
7.2.2    Taking into account the effects on the environment,
natural gas is clearly better than oil. When comparing Vridi to
Azito, the former has an existing infrastructure but would
become one critical area for the energy production of the whole
country.
7.3      Recommended choice
7.3.1    The base alternative of a new power plant of Vridi
using natural gas as primary energy source is a significant
improvement to the present situation from an environmental point
of view.
7.3.2    Vridi and Azito are equally suitable fron an
environmental point of view.
7.3.3    Although the existence of infrastructure makes the
Vridi area attractive, it leads to a situation, where the new
power plant, the existing power plant (EECI) and the oil
refinery (SIR) are all located in the same restricted area. In
the case of a catastrophe, the energy supply of COte d'Ivoire
may be seriously disturbed. It is recommended, that there will
be a separate study of operational risks in the Vridi
alternative.

MITIGATIV M-EASO1ME
1      A detailed discription of cause and effect
!lationships and the need for mitigative measures on the basis
these interrelations is given in a card format in Annex 7.
!commendations are distinguished from :equirements by separate
!marks.
1      Effluent treatment
1.1    To keep the polluting and poisoning effects of
-fluents at an acceptable level, the following requirements are
ven:
1) When discharging cooling water, use only minimum
amount of chlorine to ensure anti-fouling of pipes and
equipments.
2) All oily waters from the platform must be treated by
multi-stage oil separation is. based on gravitation and
chemical treatment and possible end filtration.
3) Sewage water from the onshore gas treatment plant
and the power plant must be led to the municipal
sewerage system.
4) When discharging sewage from the platform solids
must be ground to promote their dispersion. The
concentration of suspended solids should not exceed
150 mgSS/l. Chlorination is required only if the
following effluent quality standard is not met:
coliforms < 200/100 ml. Average chlorine in offshore
sewage is usually 30-40 ppm.
5) The protection of marine envfironment requires -also
safety basins for
- glycol tanks,
- oil tanks.
6) All waters violating pH-limits (<6 and >8,5) must be
neutralized (construction of netra_ization basins).
7) Oil spill absorbents must be available in case of
accidental spillages.
.2      Solid waste disposal
.2.1    The requirements for the solid waste disposal are as
3llows:
1) All kinds of offshore dumping activities are
prohibited.



34
2) Collect drilling mud and drilling cuttings in barges
and transport to suitable disposal areas onshore.
8.3      Control of air emissions
8.3.1.  The benefit of burning natural gas over oil is the
significant reduction in air emissions. To gain an optimal
effect, following requirements must be met:
1) Use of fuel oil of good quality (low S02-content
etc.).
2) Regular maintenance of engines on the basis of the
guidelines of equipment manufacturers will eliminate
extra polluting due to poor system performance.
3) To avoid accidental gas leakages from the pipeline,
strict control is required over navigation, anchoring
and use of fishing gear in the vicinity of the
pipeline. There should be special reporting procedures
for vessels which foul their gear on submarine
obstacles in the vicinity of gas installations.
Trawlers must not attempt salvage of snagged gear for
fear of making damage worse. Gear should be buoyed for
later identification and jettissoned.
4) Hydrostatic pipeline tests and non-destructive tests
for wells and cathodic protection and coating are
required to minimize risks of gas leaks.
5) The NO. emissions from the power plant may be reduced
to an acceptable level by combustion technique. The
impacts of the emissions may be further mitigated by
optimization of the pipe height. Steam injection may be
needed when using oil as fuel.
6) All non-corrosive pipe materials are recommended
from an environmental point of view. A system to
control pressure shocks is also required in all cases.
7) Cathodic protecticn and coating should be provided
to prevent corrosion.
8.4      Noise control
B.4.1    Noise control, which do not belong to work safety, is
presented here:
1) Anti-vibration mountings for machinery in the
platform in order not to frighten fish and marine
mammals.



35
.5     Safety at Mork
.5.i   By comparison with all other fuels, gas is and will
amain capriciDus. There is no other field of problems so severe
s those dealing with safety at work (fires, explosions etc.).
-iere must not be any compromises with the following
-quirements:
1) In drilling operations, the following components are
required:
- efficient drilling mud control system,
- use of wellhead safety valves, blowout preventors and
choke/kill valves,
- use of diverters to protect against uncontrolled well
flows.
2) From the gas field to the power plant, an emergency
shut-down system must be installed to isolate gas
leakage areas. The emergency shut-down system consists
of down hole safety valves, master shut valves and
flowing valves.
3) Control of oxygen content of all inert gas mixtures
to avoid sudden flare ups.
4) The quality of potable water in the platform must be
analysed frequently.
5) Batteries can be installed only in ventilated
cabinets.
6) Smoking is prohibited in the cabinets. Smoking is
allowed in designated areas only.
7) Place accommodation unit of the platform as far as-
possible from the noise sources.
8) One vessel must always be present at the platform.
9) Support vessels must be equipped with fire fighting
facilities.
10) To protect the pipeline and the platform, their
location must be shown on various maps and charts
(navigation charts etc.).
11) Clear rules for maintenance operations. Clear rules
for lifting operations.
12) The obligatory use of ear protectors when noise
level exceeds 85 dB.
131 Safety equipment to prevent overfillings of various
tanks (chemicals, oil,...).
14) In transformers and capacitors, use of oils that do
not develop PCB when burning.



36
15) Emergency showers and eye wash kits for the
platform, gas treatment plant and thermal power plant.
16) Installation of efficient gas detection systems in
the hazardous areas of the platform, the treatment
plant and the new power plant. In addition to'
detectors, a system for monitoring and for testing and
calibrating the equipment is required.
17) Installation of fire detection systems (smoke, UV,
IR and heat detectors) accomplished with a system for
monitoring and for testing and calibrating the
equipment.
18) Installation of fire fighting facilities (fire
water pumps, deluge valves, CO2-systems and portable
fire-extinguishers) in all parts of the system taking
especially into consideration such risky targets as
fuel tanks etc.
19) Those officers responsible for fire fighting and
evacuation must be clearly identified.
20) An efficient evacuation system and frequent
evacuation rehearsals are required. This is not
possible without an efficient telecommunication system.
21) Adequate first-aid facilities and trained personnel
are needed in all permanently occupied places.
22) Regular safety inspections in all parts of the
system.
23) Power distribution must be secured through an
emergency power generation system.
8.6      work yolicies
8.6.1    Through the following work policies the enviroment is
protected against unnecessary pollution:
1) Use water based or non-toxic-mud in drilling
operations. This minimizes the release of chemicals
into the sea.
2) When designing the pipeline route, avoid the area
where steep slopes, uneven seabottom morphology,
obstacles, soft (cohesive) sediments, currents with
heavy sediment transport and active accumulation or
erosion occurs.
3) Safety cover around pipeline and other constructions
such as stone moles and tetrapods prevent littoral
erosion.
4) To prevent soil erosion, immediately after the
construction of the gas treatment unit and the new
power plant, plant new fast growing sand grasses and
halophytic plants-



37
.7     Social Rolicy
.7.1    The two spontaneous villages on the western and eastern
anks of the Canal de Vridi are located within the safety zones
500 m) of the gas treatment plant and the new thermal power
lant. Although there is not a legal basis for their existence,
aey have become a sensitive social issue. This should be
arried out carefully by informing the people in advance that
aey will be offered a compensatory land area.
.7.2    It is recommended that the following steps will be
dopted:
1) People in both areas will be informed in advance
that they will be offered a better place to live as a
compensation for the disturbance.
2) Migration to the new area will be arranged in such a
way that no new spon-aneous villages can arise prior to
the start-up of civ;il works.
.8     Need for furtherinvestisations
.8.1    To eliminate risks possibly related to certain
crtivities, the following studies are recommended:
1) Detailed studies of the sediment structure in the
gas field. Calculation of possible subsidence before
operations.
2) Recommendation: By offshore geophysical surveys
(echosounding, acoustic reflection and side scan sonar
Profiling, under water cameras) along the pipeline
route at least 200 m on both side of the trackline, one
checks the sea bottom material, morphology, wrecks and
other possible obstacles, which-may endanger the
pipeline. Further information can be gained through
detailed soil investigations, calculations of seismic
avtivity, and measurements of current, wave and tide
activities.
3) Recommendation: Detailed investigations and
measurements of the amount of coastal erosion west of
Canal de Vridi.
4) A careful study of the risks of disruption to the
energy supply of Cote d'Ivoire must be made if the new
power plant is located in the Vridi area. In this first
option both the existing power plant, the oil refinery
and the new power plant will be located in the same
place. Adopting the Azito's alternative would reduce
the risks of a disruption of energy supply by spreading
the plants over a wider area.
5) it is recommeunded that the dispersion of NO
e-missions from the power plant is evaluated. It is also
recommended to make dispersion calculations for the NO"



38
and so2 emissions from the platform if they are in the
order of magnitude of 1000 tons/a.
8.9      Other observations
8.91    Wetlands and mariculture
8.91.1   Apart from the risk of acacdification of rain and
surface waters, we do not believe that the development of gas
field Foxtrot will adversely affect the wetlands and mariculture
of the Cote d'Ivoire.
8.92     Ground and surface water
8.92.1   If all the recommendations for pollution control in the
treatment plant and new power plant are followed there should be
little risk to ground and surface water quality.
8.10     Enerav suit1v of C8te d'Ivoire
8.101    The minimization of man-caused risks for the energy
supply of C8te d'Ivoize requires the following measures:
- fencing of the plant area,
- lighting of the plant area,
- 24 h TV-security system and
*        - personnel checks by use of I.D. cards.
8.11     C;st estimates
8.111    Unavoidable costs
8.111.1 According to the IMO-guidelines (UN organisation)
platforms situated 4...12 sea miles from the coast, must use
grinding and disinfection when discharging sanitary waters. The
costs created by these two unit operations are unavoidable.
8.111.2 Discharge of oily waters into the sea is forbidden
(IMO-guidelines). A multi-stage oil separator, a collection
system for overflows and spillages and safety basins must be
installed.
8.111.3 A disposal system for all solid waste (e.g. old
batteries, canisters, etc.) is required on the basis existing
environmental regulations.
8.111.4 Gas and fire detection systems, fire fighting
equipments, the emergency shut-down system and other security
related devices (mud control, safety valves, diverters) form an
unavoidable part of the control system of the platform.
8.111.5 An emergency power generation system is also required
to ensure uninterrupted production.



*   R9
.11i.6 Safety cover around the pipeline (or sinking the
p.neline into the substrata) is unavoidable.
;11.7  Water based or non-toxic muds s4iould be used in
-illing operations.
.112    Marginal extra costs
.112.1  The following requirements can marginally increase the
,plementation costs:
- regular maintenance of engines,
- navigation control should be duties of the coast
guard,
- anti-vibration mountings for machinery,
- only oils that do not develop PCB when burning should
be used,
- frequent control of potable water quality,
- use of ear protectors, emergency showers and eye wash
kits,
- evacuation system,
- location of accommodation unit far away from noise
sources,
- insulation of noise sources,
- sand stabilization by plants
- use of fuel oil of good quality will be more
expensive than use of low quality oil, but it is not
reflected in investment costs,
- replacement of chlorination by UV-disinfection will
increase the investment costs only moderately.
.113    Costs created only by               demands
.113.1  Collection and transportation of drilling mud and
uttings protects the marine environment.; The cost estimate
ncluding the hiring of a barge and lorries and personnel, is
000 000 USD.
.113.2  Steam injection to reduce NO emissions from the power
lant (when using oil). The cost estimate is 250 million CFA or
10O00 USD.
.113.3 Dispersion calculations of the NO. emissions from the
ower plant, cost 40 000 USD.
.113.4 Cost estimate for detailed studies of the sediment
tructure in the gas field is 150 000 USD.
.113.5 Recommended offshore geophysical surveys cost 250 000
SD.
.113.6 Recommended investigations and measurements of the
mount of coastal erosion west of Canal de Vridi, cost 50 000
-SD.



40
8.113.7 The estimated relocation coSt for the western (gas
treatment plant) and the eastern bank (new power plant) of Canal
de Vridi is estimated to be 100 000 USD. The safety zone is
assumed to be 500 m and the number of people to be migrated 200
on western bank and 1000 on eastern bank.

MONITORING SYSTEM
Whatever measures are required to protect the
ivironment, their cost to benefit ratio wil] be extremely
-sadv&nregous, unless a continuous operatioxlal capability is
aaranteed. An efficient follow-up and contral system is a
.senrial for the longterm sustainability of an acceptable
ivironment.

9.5      The values for NO, concentrations are those of WHO.
9.6      Health and safety at work legislation is used widely in
European countries to ensure protection of the workforce from
hazards in the place of employment. Nowhere is this more
important than in the gas industry, but as this industry does
not Currently exist in COte d'Ivoire, there is not relevant
safety legislation. We suggest that, at least initially,
appropriate legislation is copied from France or another
European country.

3.2 Training needs
0.2.1   Sufficient training in awareness of hazards, accident
ad eracuation procedures associated with the gas industry is
ssential for personnel, safety officers and authorities so that
iven principles will be implemented in an efficient way. The
Dst important targets of training are as follows:
- For all personnel training in awareness of hazards
associated with the gas industry,
- specific training for the safety officers in the gas
industry,
- specific training for Ministry of Industry, Mines and
Power inspectorate for the gas industry,



44
- specific training in accident procedures offshore
associated with gas escapes for the coast guard and
fire fighters,
- specific training in accident procedures onshore with
escapes of gas for fire fighters.
10.3     Policy and legal strenathenina
10.3.1   The lass on air quality and waste management and on
workers' safety should be clarified. A clearer division of
responsabilities between the various Ministries is essential for
an efficient environmental policy. The following steps should be
carried out to strengthen the present legislation: -
- establish the law for the protection of air quality
and specify standards,
- clarify the law on waste management as it effects the
gas industry,
- clarify the law on workers' safety as it effects the
gas industry,
There is a need for trained body of staff to monitor the
operator to check that he is conforming with the conditions of
the permits.

1.2     The chief social problem arising from this project
oncerns the inhabitants of the spontaneous villages in Vridi
rea. The majority of the people contacted were not aware of the
roject and had very little understanding of it. The
onsultation about migration is a social bomb, if no detailed
igration program exists. This requires the determination of the
ayer as well as the detailed design of new housing areas (land
wnership, income sources etc.). The relocation plan was not
f



46
part of the scope of the work of the consultant. Consultation
without any information about housing and an employment
elsewhere would probably have provoked social unrest. Many
problems attached to migration needs can be avoided by careful
design. Especially the adoption of the Azito alternative would
solve the migration prob.em.
11.3     It is recommended that further consultations take place
between the operator and the Ministry of Industry, Mines and
Power, who will need to consult the following affected groups
and other ministries:

2.      CCNIaLQIOaS
2.1     Overall conclusions
2.1.1   The basic solution of using the gas field Foxtrot, the
ubmarine pipeline and the new thermal power station in Vridi
rea is feasible.
2.1.2   The replacement of oil by natural gas will improve the
tate of the environLment of the COte d'Ivoire significantly.
here will be no SO or dust emiss:ons and the estimated
eduction of Co2 emissions is 50 * and that of NO, emissions 70 %
n the combustion phase when compared to the use of oil. On the
asis of present day technology, there is no better alternative
-ommercially available.
2.1.3   There are no "killing assumptions" behind the use of
.atural gas. Al. requirements can be solved in practice w6thout
Lajor difficulties.
.2.2      eed fer mitioative measures
.2.21    Most imeortant cbservations
-2.21.1 By comparison with all other fuels, gas is and will
-emain capricious. There is no other field of problems so severe
-s those dealing with safety at work (e.g. fires arLd
zxplosions). There must be no compromises witt the safety
-equirements.
.2.21.2 The two spontaneous villages on the western and eastern
3anks of the Canal de Vridi are located within the safety zones
(500 m) of the gas treatment plant and the new thermal power
1ant. Although there is not a legal basis for their existence,
:hey have become a sensitive social issue, which needs delicate
iandling if the whole project is not be endangered.
;2.22 observations in detail
2.22.1 Mitigative measures required or recommended for
lffluent treatment, solid waste disposal, control of air
3ollution, noise control, safety at work, work policies and
;ocial policy are given in chapter 8. The most important
-equirements are as follows:
- reduction of NO, emissions from the power plant by
combustion tecbnique and by steam injection when using
oil as fuel,
- all oily waters must be treated by a multi-stage
separator based on gravitation and succeeding chemical
treatment and possible end filtration to avoid marine
pollution,



48
- when discharging sewage, the protection of marine
environment requires, that solids must be ground to
promote their dispersion and chlorination or preferably
UV-disinfection must be applied when the number of
effluent coliforms exceeds 200/100 ml,
- safety basins are required for glycol and oil to
protect the workers and the marine and terrestrial
environment,
- installation of effective fire and gas detection
systems and fire fighting systems are required directly
for the safety at work and indirectly to protect the
atmospheric, marine and terrestrial environment,
- for the same reasons as in the previous point, an
emergency shut-down system and an emergency power
generation system are required,
- an efficient evacuat.ion system and frequent
evacuation rehearsals support the same targets as
above,
- water based or non-toxic muds should be used in
drilling operations to protect the marine environment,
- safety cover around the sabmarine pipeline will
protect the marine environment; an alternative is to
dig the pipeline into the sea bottom,
- social cc-nflicts are avoided by relocating part of
the population in spontaneous villages in such a way,
that they will be offere. a better housing and
employment elsewhere.
12.22.2 The mitigative measures determined in Chapter 8 have an
important role in the form of a check list. It is the duty of
the authorities of C8te d'Ivoire to check, that the futurez
design of the project Foxtrot addresses all the points
determined.
12.23       itional       d    to     ronmental    eeti4 't
12.23.1  The following costs are based mainly on the
environmental requirements and they can be regarded in this
sense as extra project costs:
- collection and transportation of drilling mud and
cuttings protects the marine environment,
- steam injection reduees the NO emissions and thus
protects the atmoscheric environment,
- dispersion calculation of NO. emissions fzm the power
plant,
- recommended offshore geophysical surveys helps to
minimize risks due to pipeline subsidences and thus
protects the marine environment,
- recommended investigations and measurements of the
amount of coastal erosion west of Canal de Vridi has
the same target as above,
- recommended seismographic registration warns about
seismic activities, which may endanger the submarine
pipeline and the platform and thus lead to loss of life
and potential pollution of atmospheric and marine
environment in extreme cases,
- relocation of parts of spontaneous villages protects
human lives.

2.23.2 The estimated totai cost of the above mentioned
ztivities total 2.7 million USD. These costs can be regarded
inor when compared to the total cost of the project Foxtrot.
2.3     Local canabilities
2.3.1   The geophysical station of Lamto has the capability to
ake the responsability of seismic magnitude registrations in
he proj$ct area.
2.3.,   The measurements-and calculations of coastal erosion
an be carried out by both the Laboratoire du Batiment et des
ravaux public and the Centre de Recherces Oceanographiques. -The
atter can also take care of measurements of wave, tide and
urrent activities.

Solids must be ground and effluent must be disinfected if
coliforms exceed 200/100-ml (= -disinfection or
chlo.rinationl on the basis of existing regulations.
It is recomuended to avoid chlorination at low bacteria
levels, since chlorine is haarmful to marine environment.
10) REMARKS
Chlorination is not recommended. Various standards exist
for offshore sewage discharge: in USA coliforms
(bacteria) must not exceed 200/100 ml. water and the
amount of solid waste must not exceed 150 mg/J. The
average chlorine in offshore sewage is 30-40 ppm. The
adverse effects of chlosine discharge can be reduced by
dilution before discharge.
Use liquid chlorine rather than gas.

A simple treatment method is to pass sewage through a
grinder and then through a chlorination tank.
Following values for sodium hypochlorite have been
established:
LC,, (concentration that within testing period kills 50 %
of the population); values for fish:
- 0.07 mg/l (Ci). 48 hours Salmo gairdiieri
- 5.9 mg/l (C,), 96 hours Pimephales promelas
LOEC (lowest concentration that within testing period
induces some specified toxicological reactions); values

10) REMARKS
Drilling fluid is used for the removal and transport of
cuttings to surface, to control sub-surface pressure,
to stabilize the borehole, to cool and lubric?te the
drill string and bit-_
Oil based mud contains up to 95 4a diesel or mineral
oil.
The total discharge of solid waste material (drilling
fluids and cuttings) from a well 2500 m deep will.
approximately be between 2000-3000 tons.
The currents transport some of the drilling mud. The
drilling r.ud consists mostly of baryte, which has a
high density (d- >4.3 glcm?) and it therefore
accumulates around the platform. The turbidity is high
near to the platform and decreases quickly downcurrent.

i0) REARKS
Noise level data for platform machinery in air has been
identified fo-:
- gas turbines and generator about  85-95 dB (3-5 m)
- compressors                 about  95    dE (3-5 m)
- diesel engines              about  90    dB (3-5 m)
- high pressure piston pumps about  95    dB (3-5 m)
However, it is difficult to estimate the submarine
effects reliably. Vibrations of the platform structure
rather than noise are likely to affect marine fauna,
especially fish.

CO2 and water together causes corrosion and therefore
CO2 has to be removed before natural gas is compressed
into the pipeline.
The torch system breaks safely down hydrocarbons, which
cannot be used on the platforiL or transported
elsewhere. It also works as a safety device during
malfunctions and emergencies.
There were not any estimations available on the air
emissions from torch and power generations systems. If
the SO2 or NO, emissions are in the order of magnitude
of 1000 tons/a, it is recommended to make dispersion
calculations to evaluate the effects onshore and to
have sufficient air pollution control measures.

10) REMARKS
The eastward flowing "Guinea current" washes the shores
at an average surface speed of 0.3.. .1.1 mJs. Its
effects reach depths 20.. .50 m. A more feeble
"undercurrant Ivoirien" flowing in the opposite
direction at a speed 0.3...O.1 m/s. This is recorded in
depths 15...80 m.
A Atlantic swell affects the region with a wave height
of between 1.. .1.8 a. Waves occur roughly at 10 ...11
second intervals. The strongest swell occurs between
May and August. Severe tropical storms with
exceptionally high wave conditions (4... 5 m) occur
about once every 20 years.
The main upward force is caused by buoyance. Waves and
currents-cause horisontal movements. Friction resists
there. Upward pressure will come from sediment force as
well as from wave and current activities.
There is only little information about the seismic
activity in Cote d'Tvoire. The geophysical station
LA.MTO (established in 1962) has measured in average
2000 vibrations annually. These vibrations are mostly
distant. At least three stronger earthquakes of
m magnitude 6 (Richter scale) has been measured (1939 in
3hana, 1971 in the Gulf of Guinea and 1983 in Guinea).
The 'vibrations are in the southern part of C6te
d'Ivoire mostly 2 - 4 of magnitude in the Richter's
scale.

_0) REMRKS
Methane is about _00 times more efficient areenhouse
gas than CO2.
Following figu-es were used for the estimation of the
methane and CO2leakages in the production and _ransport
phase:
Estimated leakage of methane in production: 0,2 % of
consumed gas.
Estimated leakage of methane in transport: 0,1 % of
consumed gas.
Estimated leakage of CO2in production and transport:
2 g/MJ consumed gas.
Consumed gas: 750 million mela
Density of the gas: 0,754 kg/e3.
Source for the methane leakage estimation: The
Alphatania Group, Methane Leakage from Natural Gas
Operations, London, July 1989.
There will be also leakages of other hydrocarbons
during production and transport of natural gas, but
their share of the leakages is minor. The share of
methane in the natural gas is about 83 % and the other
hydrocarbons about 14 %.

9) MITIGATIVE MEASURES
Marine environment can cope with biodestruction up to a
certain limit by natural means. An effIcient pipeline
maintainance and control system helps to minimise the
risks of leakages and to raise the alarm without
unnecessary delays. The choice of correct materials and
ecuipment (steels, valves etc.) will also be important.
Installation of automatically operated cut out valves to
stop gas leakages and use of pressure control devices.
Hydrostatic pipeline tests and non-destructive well tests
prior to system start up.
All pipeline components should have relevant quality
standard certificates.
Cathodic protection and coating should be provided to
prevent corrosion.
Strict control-over navigation and use of fishing gear in
the vicinity of the pipeline. A 1.5 km. wide exclusion
band is proposed. Use of navigational warning equipment
e.g. radars, foghorns, rockets and marine
telecommunication. Adequate marking of platform and
pipeline exclusion zone on all maps and charts. Protect
pipeline by marking it on the shore where the submerged
pipeline is situated. Public awarexess.
Special reporting procesdures for vessels which foul their
-.gear on submarine obstacles in the vicinity of gas
Installations.
Trawlers must not attempt salvage of snagged gear for fear
of making damage worse. Gear should be buoyed and
jettissoned.
All kind of offshore dmping activities in the pipeline
area should be prohibited.
Provision of adequate first-aid training, efficient
evacuation plans and v supply vessel present at the
platform at all times.
10)IREMARKS
By percentage mass the gas in the pipeline will be
constituted as: N2 2.4%, CO, 1.44, EHS 0.0%, CH, 82.7%, C1H6
4.9%, CAH. 3.4%, iC6B, 1.0%, nCHj, 1.4%, iC.3,a 0.6%, nCE,H
0.6%, Pseudo C, and C,+ 1.7%. Thus the least toxic elements
Methane (CE4), Ethane (CAH) and Propane (CH1) will
constitute around 91 % of the total mass, and the more
toxic Butane (i+nC,R,,), Pentane (i+nCsHn) and higher
hydrocarbons will constitute around S % of the total mass.



42
Toxicity data for these hydrocarbons on marine organisms
was not available but figures for terrestrial mammals
suggest that 25 mg/kg/day N-Butane within 3 day feeding
kills 50 % of the population. The lowest concentration of
Pentane that induces nervors system disorders and cancers
in mammals is 13000 ppm by inhalation (rat).
Because of the immense dilution effects and experience
with oil pollution, these data suggest that a gas escape
in the sea would not have a serious toxic effect on marine
animals. The ratio of gas to liquids escaping will depend
on the pressure and thus the depth of the rupture.
Escaping gas will rise to the surface of the sea. Methane
and Ethane are lighter than air and will rise and disperse
in the atmosphere. The heavier gasses, Propane and Butan-
e, will accumulate and lie on the water's surface, but
these form a small component of the total. They will
disperse in the air more slowly. Butane, which is toxic,
will threaten surface life, e.g. sea-birds, as well as
fishermen in small boats. There will be risks of fires and
explosions at hot spots. Escaping liquids will be lighter
than water so they will also rise to the surface and most
will vapourise there. A small element of oily material
will remain and may dissolve. Thus the bulk of hydrocarbon
loss will be Methane to the atmosphere.

10) REMARKS
The common attitude towards using chlorine to prevent
fouling is nowadays very negative.
Following values for sodium hypochlorite have been
established:
LCs0 (concentration that within testing period kills 50%
of the population) values to fish:
- 0,07 mg/i (Cl2), 48 h, Salmo gairdneri
- 5,9 mg/I. 96 h, Pimephales promelas
LOEC (lowest concentration that within testing period
-induces some specified t-dxicological reactions) values
for fish:
- 0,02 mg/l., Oncorhynchus kisutch
Effects on reproduction of water organisms:
- Piscicole salmotica, 0,094 mg/l, 1 d, change in per-
cent hatch or time to hatch
The toxicity of NaOH is based on the increasing
pH-value and the toxity of sulphuric acid is based on
the acidity it induces. The effects of these substances
on water and soil will depend on the neutralization and
buffering capacity of the soil and water.

1) ACTIVITY, ACTION, OPERATION
Operation of the new power plant
2) IMPACT
Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO.)
3) TARGET
- local people
- quality of local air, soil, ground and surface water
- local flora and fauna
4) EFFECT
The possible effects are the following:
High concentrations may cause direct damages to
vegetation. The WHO guidelines to prevent vegetation
damages are 95 g NO2/m3 as 4 h average and 30 g N02/m3
as an annual average.
High concentrations of NO, may effect adversely to
lungs. People having astbma are especially sensitive.
The WHO guidelines to prevent the health effects are
400 g NO2/m3 as one hour average and 150 g NO2/m3 as
24 hour average.
Nitrogen oxides form nitrous acid through reactions
with water. This may cause acidification of soils and
water, which in turn may cause damage to flora and
fauna. The acidification may cause loss of nutrients in
soils and solubilization of heavy metals.
High deposition of nitrogen compounds may cause
eutrofication of waters and the nitrogen saturation of
soils.The nitrogen saturation of soils leads also to
acidification.
Formation of ozone in the reactions of NO. with
hydrocarbons. Ozone may be a health hazard and it has
been observed to cause damage to vegetation at rather
low concentrations, near the background values.
The most loaded areas will be the City of Abidjan and
the east side of the Vridi Canal according to the
prevailing wind directions. Most of the emissions will
propably deposit within 10-20 km from the emission
point. Because of the rather low emission amounts and
the dilution of the emissions in the air, the
concentrations will propably not be very high.

The NO3 emissions may have some effects on tbe cocos
palm tree plantations located on the west side of the
Canal de Vridi, but there was no information *2vUlable
of their sensitivity to the emissions.

2-3
The nature of effects will depend on the amounts of
emissions and of other pollution carried in the air and
on the sensitivity of the ecosystems to the pollution..
When evaluating the possible effects other emissions of
the area should also be taken into account.
area. Combined effects of high concentrations of NO1,,
SO2 and 03 may be very serious for the plants.
8) NEED FOR MITIGATIVE MEASURES
Yes
9) MITIGATIVE MEASURES
If the NO emissions are at the level of 60 - 80 mg
N02/NJ, there is propably no need for any other
mitigating measures. However, we recommend that the
dispersion of the emissions is evaluated and chimney
height is optimized. Usually the minimum height of the
pipe is 10 meters higher than the other buildings at
the radius of 1 km from the emission point.
For the worst gas turDines it might be necessary to use
catalysator to reduce the emissions. The achieved
emission level when using the catalysator can be lower
than 10 mg NO2IMJ.
When oil is used as fuel it is also possible to use
steam injection to reduce the emissions. The emissions
can be reduced from 200 mg N02/MJ to about 60 mg/NJ.
When using gas as fuel it is unnecessary to use steam
injection. The steam injection reduces the efficiency
of the plant and the reduction of emissions can be
achieved by combustion technique. Normally in the



69
combined cycle power plants there is an option to use
steam injection when using oil fuel. The investment
costs for the steam injection are minor compared with
the catalysator. The order of mangnitude of the costs
are 250 million FCFA and 5000 million FCFA
respectively-
10) REMARKS
The best gas turbines can achieve the NO. emission level
of 60-80 mg NO2tMJ by combustion technique. The NO,
emissions tram the worst gas turbines are at the level
200 mg NO2/MJ. Depending on the type of turbines the NO,
emissions will be around 140 - 500 t/a from one
turbine.
There are also emissions of CO from the gas turbines,
but normally they are rather small. If the NO. emissions
are reduced to very low level, the emissions of CO will
increase and 'it may become a problem.
When using oil-fuel, the NO, emissions are at best 150
mgjMJ and in the worst case 500 mg/MJ.
The NO emissions will be less per produced energy
amount than by using other fossil fuels.
The following assuztions were made for the
calculations:
- there will be two equal gas turbines of 43 MW
- the gas flow/ turbine: 9550 reIh
- the annual oPeration time: 7000 n

Hazardous wastes (used oils, solvents, wastes
containing heavy metals or PCB, etc.) should be dumped
to a special landfill for hazardous wastes or some of
the wastes should be incinerated in high temperatures.
10) REMARKS
In Abidjan the ordinary wastes from industry are
disposed along with common household wastes. For the
specific and toxic wastes it has not been possible to
find satisfactory disposal solutions due to lack of
special disposal or dumping system and incineration
facilities.
In Abidjan about one third of the generated industrial
waste is disposed of in Akuedo dumping site. Rest of
the wastes are recovered or recycled or incinerated in
oven. Part of the hazardous and toxic wastes are
disposed together with the ordinary wastes. Those
wastes include sticky or solid ones. This arrangement
is not satisfactory, but is better than the disposal of
the wastes randomly to the environment. LiquidLs are
most often drained to the waters either directly or
afLer sedimentation or neutralization. The most
hazardous wastes are stored by the producers. In the
case of oils and oily products a company is responsible
for recovering and processing them for fuel purpose. It
mainly recycles oils from boats and car engines.

Consumption for the power plant will be about 5,8 m'/s and
the net temperature increase 10 1C.
The cooling water consumpti6fo and increase in temperature
is in the same order in the present power station and it
is returned back to the Canal de Vridi through an open

discharge over point of intake water was said to be +2"C.
In the current climate chlorine is now regarded
unfavourably as an anti-foulant. We have established the
following values for sodium hypochlorite:
