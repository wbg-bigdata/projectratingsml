MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CRED)IT
TO ALBANIA
FOR A RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.     I submit for your approval the following memorandlum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Albania for SDR 4.1 million, the equivalent of US$6.0 million, on standard IDA terms with 40 years
maturity, to help finance a project for rural development to extend a successful pilot project (Credit 2461-
ALB).
Part I - Recent Country Developments
2.     Economic Developments.  Since the discussion of the last CAS presented to the Board in
September 1993, Albania has continued to emerge from  the dleep social and economic crisis that
accompanied the collapse of communism  in 1990-1992. The periodl from summer 1992 to fall 1994
proved enormously successful-GDP grew annually at close to 10 percent and inflation steadily declined.
The macroeconomic program supported by the IMF and Worldc Bank remained on track; and substantial
remittances from abroad, coupled with the income created by the newly-emerging private sector in
agriculture, tradle, and services, tueled an extraordinary expansion in demand, reflecting a rapidly
increasing standard of living for large segments of the poptulation. The number of private vehicles, for
example, increased from an estimated 12,000 at the endl of 1991 to an estinated 83,000 by summer 1994.
Electricity consumption has increased by nearly 30 percent since 1992. And despite this enormous
demand-led growth, inflation declined to an end periodL annual rate of less than 14 percent in 1994, a
tribute to the macroeconomic program strictly adhered to by the Central Bank and the Ministry of
Finance.
3.     The very strength of the economic recovery has led, however, to the severe infrastructure
bottlenecks foreseen by the 1993 CAS. As described at that timne, "Albania's dilapidated infrastructure
is a major impediment to private sector developiment. . . The priorities are in the electricity distribution
system, where reduced fuel-wood deliveries to urban areas since 1991 have led to capacity overloading,
causing severe damage to electrical equipment; in the transport system, which has deteriorated to the point
where a significant share of the main roads are in need of repair andl the port facilities at Durres need
rehabilitating; and in housing, where dwellings are overcrowded, obsolete, and have poor sanitation.
Investment flows averaging close to 20 percent of GDP would he re(Luired to meet the growth objectives.
These unusually high ratios reflect the need to rebuiild infrastructuLe as well as the low and unsustainable
level of public investment.   " The recluired level of investment could not yet be provided under the
constraints of the adjustment program over the last two years. While the government has been successftul
in overall macroeconomic policy, and while small entrepreneurs have shown remarkahle imagination and
dynamism  after nearly 50 years of total suLppression, the public sector as such has been unable to
contribute to Albania's recovery. A combination of outmodledl tecthnology and extremely low wages and
salaries in public administration has led to the dleparture of many competent staff and not much hope for
a privatization-led recovery in the existing industrial sector. Most of the public enterprises do not have
positive market value and cannot, therefore, attract investor interest. There are some exceptions in the
mining, infrastructure, and food processing sectors. and successt'ul privatization of these enterprises is
one of the key challenges and hopes for 1995.



- 2 -
4.     The first dramatic manifestation of the infrastructure bottleneck has been the energy crisis of
December 1994. To improve resource allocation and fiscal performance, a major energy pricing package
in April 1994 freed fuelwood and coal prices for households, raised the kerosene price for households
by 400 percent, doubled the price of LPG, and introduced increases tor district heating and natural gas;
power tariffs for households were raised on average by 150 percent. This has been the most courageous
pricing reform undertaken by any transition economy. It is not sufficient, however, to increase prices;
it is also necessary to carry out tariff collection in an administrative and technical environment that makes
effective billing quite difficult. Unbilled electricity consumption has increased twenty-fold since 1990.
including a still-robust 21 percent increase in 1994. In response to the deteriorating situation, IDA's
Board approved a small emergency operation in 1994 to help reduce power losses through stepped-up
metering of electricity in households, enforcing meter readings, and collecting bills. Equipment imported
under this project is being procured, and the associated measures to stem power losses are being
undertaken, so that improvements are expected over the next year.
5.     In the meantime, a particularly cold winter in December 1994 created heavy and sudden demand
for electricity, putting enormous strain on existing infrastructure. This was caused by not only the peak
winter demand in households, but also by a temporary breakdown in power supply, because of depleted
water reserves in the country's hydrogeneration facilities after successive years of low precipitation and
an all but absent rainy season in fall 1994. With the cold weather last December, power outages became
more frequent, creating difficult living conditions, disrupting already precarious water supply in towns,
and affecting economic activity across the board. Many people were left without power for days at a
time. The situation continues to be delicate, although milder temperatures and some rain early this
January have somewhat reduced outages over the last few days. In the past, at times of similar drought
and cold weather, the solution had been to import energy from Yugoslavia. UN sanctions and the
ongoing crisis in the Balkans have not allowed similar rapid recourse to this traditional source of energy
imports. There have been some imports from Greece, but there, too, political tensions are threatening
a safe supply. The Government has had to deal with the situation by strict rationing of electricity and
by providing emergency funding ftor KESH, the power company, to install small generators. The work
is in progress; some equiipment is being made available through the Critical Imports Project, IDA's first
operation, and these undertakings are expected to bring some short-term relief.
6.     The difficuilties in rehabilitating infrastrctuire have not been Im1iited to electric power anl(d water.
Albania's infrastructuire continues to be weak in general, and whatever is functioning is in a badl state of
repair-roads are worse than anywhere else in post-comnILlilist Europe, anld some one millioni people are
cut off from the center of the country becauise of poor feeder IrOiod conditions; water supply is precariouis.

a second Transport Project (fall 1995). Alongside tralitionll infrastrLIctilre projects, etlorts to reach the
poorest segments of the poptulation-both thiouIgh small-scatle ptublic works andL micro-credit-are an
important component of IDA's strategy, as exemplified by this project and the previous Rurall Poverty
Alleviation Pilot Project.



- 3 -
8.     Overall performance of the IDA porttolio has been good. Cumulative IDA disbursements have,
so far, been 50 percent ahead of worldwide IDA averages, and the development impact of the portfolio
has met the desired objectives. New IDA projects, with one notable exception, have taken less than three
months on average to become effective. At this time, all IDA operations are effective and disbursing,
expect for a health project approved by the Board two months ago. To further strengthen portfolio
ownership and management, a process of formal consultations was started in October 1994, involving the
Prime Minister's office, key Government officials, and the various Project Implementation Units
operating under IDA projects in Albania, as well as the responsible departmental managers on the Bank's
side. This Country Portfolio Performance Review will be repeated at least once a year, and it has been
designed to focus not only on narrow project-specific problems, but also to address institutional and
policy issues, which need to be kept under constant review so that infrastructure and other investments
can be effectively implemented.
9.     Political Developments. Since the 1993 CAS, the political situation, while relatively stable by
Eastern European standards, has also changed considerahly. The Democratic Party, which was elected
in a landslide with close to a two-thirds majority in Parliament, permitting rapid and decisive legislative
actions such as the sweeping privatization of agriculture and the almost complete liberalization of prices
at the very start of the reform program, has lost some support, although it does retain a working majority
in Parliament. First, a small group of parliamentarians left and established their own parliamentary
group, which has increasingly moved closer to the opposition socialist party. Second, another group, on
the conservative right, backing radical restitution to previous owner families at home and a much more
militant nationalist foreign policy in the Balkans, also split away, further weakening the mainstream
democrats now under attack from both the left and right. An important issue, further complicating the
situation, relates to the need of agreeing on a new democratic constitution. As is the case with quite a
few other countries in Eastern Europe, the Albanian political system still operates under the old
communist constitution, although special laws on elections and on human rights were passed in 1993 and
1994.  The Council of Europe conditioned its acceptance of Albania on the adoption of a new
constitution, but it turned out to be impossible to find the two-thirds majority in parliament required by
the old constitution to approve a new one. To break this vicious circle, the President put a new draft
constitution-reflecting a mix of a French-type presidential system and an Italian or German-type
parliamentary system-to a popular referendum.  The referendum was rejected by 52 percent of the
voters, representing a coalition of the opposition from the traditional socialists and the newly-formed
conservative-nationalist forces on the far right, as well as others who objected to the excessive "old style"
camipaign and TV coverage, which backfired rather than helped the government.
10.    Despite impressive economic performance in 1993 and 1994 and the great stride democratic
freedoms have made in Albania, of which the referendum was another telling example, the Democratic
Party and President Berisha's "honeymoon" period with the Albanian electorate is over, and the anti-
communist reformists that came to power in 1992 are now facing the same political difficulties that their
counterparts are facing throughout the post-communist societies. The regional context, including the
ongoing Yugoslav tragedy, the situation of close to two million ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, the difficult
relations with Greece, and continuing instability in Macedonia, add to Albania's difficulties. On the
positive side, there now exists the basic institutions of a modern, democratic state, including an
increasingly competent Central Bank as the guardian of macroeconomic stability. There is also a dynamic
new private sector increasingly capable of entering into more important ventures and offering new jobs
and opportunities.  On the negative side, there is an increasingly tense internal political debate, a
government weakened by the results of the referendum, a public administration that is having great
trouble keeping the most competent staff, and a regional political situation that continues to make Albania
vulnerable to spill-overs from the ongoing crisis in the Balkans.

Part 11 - The Project
11.    Project Background. The Bank's Board of Directors approved an Agriculture Sector Adjustment
Credit in early 1993 to support structural changes in agriculture. During the same period, in February
1993, the Board of Directors approved the Rural Povecty Alleviation Pilot Project (Credit 2461-ALB for
an amount of US$2.4 million equivalent), which aimend at developing a program to attack rural poverty.
Described as a "project of hope" by President Berisha, it penetrated the prevailing turmoil and economic
inertia and reached out to small farmers and entrepreneurs in Albania's most remote villages. Pilot
project results to date have been highly positive.
12.    The countryside, where some 60 percent of Albania's population lives, has experienced enormous,
perhaps unprecedented, change. In less than two years, agricultural cooperative and state farm employees
were thrust from the most rigid form of central planning in the world into private landowners. Many of
the 400,000 newly-created small family farms, partictilarly those in hilly or mountainous areas, lack
capital, credit, basic tools, and inputs; moreover, processing and marketing, all previously undertaken
by the state, have broken down. In the ten poorest districts, landholdings average less than .9 ha per
family, too small for subsistence, and there is an absence of alternative employment opportunities. The
result has been visible: shantytowns are forming around nearly all urban centers. While macroeconomic
stabilization and price adjustments are setting the framework recuired for recovery and growth, poor
infrastructure, lack of resources and access to credit, and lack of training and appropriate technology
continue to inhibit the developiment of a rural market econoi-my.
13.    The Government's Rural Poverty Alleviation Program, formulated to complement the policy
changes being introduced under the Agriculture Sector Adjustment Credit (Credit 2524-ALB), aims at
rebuilding the rural economy on a free-market basis from the bottom up. The strategy focuses on (a)
actively alleviating rural poverty; (b) restoring food security; (c) promoting the small-scale private sector;
(d) repairing basic rural infrastructure; (e) strengthening local governments; and (f) rooting rural
development policies in local tradition and culture.
14.    The main components of the program consist of demand-driven rural works for rehabilitation of
basic village infrastructure and small credits for any type of income-generating activity via village credit
funds. The overall developiment of Albania's financial sector is being supported by the Enterprise and
Financial Sector Adjustment Credit, which was approved by the Bank's Board of Directors on August
2. 1994 to support the restructuring and privatization of the banking system and the continued
privatization of the industrial sector. Some credit is available to urban clients and bigger rural clients
through the conventional banking system. Currently in Albania, however, there is no way for smaller
farmers and entrepreneurs to access credit. The village credit fund network fills this niche-providing
micro loans to the poorer farmers who lack access to commercial banking institutions. The low size limit
on individual subloans from village credit funds (US$1,000) effectively targets them to the poorest
farmers, eventually creating future clients for savings and commercial banking institutions, which are
expected to provide larger loans to more established farmers and entrepreneurs.
15.    The programil is being imiplemented in a phased, "process" approach as follows:
Phase 1:  Pre-pilot phase (August 1992-April 1993). Funding from the U NDP (US$200,000) and from
Freres d'Esp&rance (US$20,000), a French NGO, was used to finance the first village and



farm surveys and to test organizational and technical approaches for ten rural works projects
and seven village credit funds.
Phase 2:   Pilot phase (effective April 1993). The on-going Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project is
financed by IDA (Credit 2461-ALB, US$2.4 million equivalent) and the EU (about US$1.85
million). An Italian Government grant of US$2.35 million subsequently augmented the
program to US$6.6 million total. Under this pilot phase, the Rural Development Fund was
established (it was recently transtfrmed into the Albanian Development Fund) and about 225
rural works projects and 75 village credit t'inds are being implemented in Albania's poorest
mountain districts.
Phase 3:   Full-scale project. The proposed full-scale program, which would amount to US$22 million
over three years, according to cofinancing available, would extend the project to all rural
areas with priority given to the poorest villages and communes for the labor-intensive rural
works. Within this program, the core pro ject-the subject of this Memorandum-amounts to
US$12 million; it would provide the basis of a program to extend ADF activities for three
years, which could be augmented with supplemental cofinancing.
16.    A Modular Approach. The full-scale program  lends itself easily to a modular approach-project
area and component intensity would be increased incrementally in accordance with financing resources,
and actual program size could range from  US$6.0 million to US$22.0 million. A modular approach
worked well during the pilot phase; supplemental cofinancing from the Italian Government was used to
finance new project districts (para. 19). Similarly, cofinancing in excess of the US$4.8 million requested
for the Rural Development Project would be used to expand and intensify project component activity.
Conversely, if less that US$4.8 million cofinancing is secuired, the program could be scaled back.
17.    Lessons Learned from  the Pilot Proj(ect. The IDA-supported Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot
Project (RPAPP) has three components-rural works; small-scale credit; and studies, training, and
transfer of technology-that are being imzplemented by the Albanian Development Fund (ADF), an
autonomous government agency established in September 1994 as the successor to the Rural Development
Fund.2 Experience with the RPAPP has been extremely positive to date:
*  As of December 1, 155 labor-intensive works in twenty-one districts have been financed (76
have been completed) at an average cost of US$17,780 per subproject. The rehabilitated
infrastructure-about 212 km of road, 22 potable water supply, 24 schools, 22 health centers,
7 toot bridges, and over 465 ha of irrigation-benefits nearly 215,000 people and represents
490,000 days of em)ployment.
*  A total of 59 village credit funds (VCF) have been established in seven districts to disburse
small loans (average size US$350) for income-generating activity; over 2,600 small credits
have been granted. Loan recovery, which commenced in November 1993, has been 100
percent or greater-an achievement largely attributable to village solidarity and procedures
2/     The Rural Developeinnt Fund (RDF) was established by Government Decree in January 1993 to implement the Rumn
Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project. In September 1994, the Government transfonned the RDF into the Albanian
Development Fund (ADF), authorized to work in hoth rural and urbanl areas. The ADF is supervised by a Board of
Trustecs, which is chaired by the Deputy Prine Minister anid c(onprised of tile Minister of Agriculture and Food, Minister
of Constructioi,, Minister without Portfolio for Local Govenmicnit, Ministcr of Labor, and Director of Economic
Development and Aid Coordination.



- 6 -
based on local decision making. About 30 percent of outstanding loans are in the process of
being repaid, and 3 percent have been entirely repaid.
*  Given the high volatility of inflation and the exchange rate in the early stages of Albania's
reform process, it was decided from the outset of the pilot project, after consultation with
potential village borrowers, to link subloan capital to the US dollar plus 6 percent, thereby
assuring a real positive interest rate in dollar terms. This dollar denomination seems to have
provided greater stability to the scheme, given the substantive amount of "dollarization" of
the Albanian economy that tollowed the inflow of remittances and encouraged by the early
volatility of inflation and the exchange rate.
*  Activities to transfer technology (microenterprise support) began in late 1993.  Three
common facility centers (agroprocessing demonstration projects) are being prepared, one of
which-a goat cheese processing unit-is expected to become fully operational in 1995.
18.    A project impact (beneficiary assessment) study carried out in 21 villages in April and May 1994
confirms that the project is viewed very positively by beneficiaries. The main lessons learned during the
pilot project are the following:
(a)  A "learning by doing" approach is an effective method for developing a flexible, demand-
driven project in a transition economy while providing for immediate and visible results.
The approach does not compromise project quality; on the contrary, it results in more
meaningful project preparation and provides tor built-in project adaptability to a changing
environment.
(b) The quality of rural works undertaken by communes using unemployed village labor can be
fairly high, provided that project feedback is continually used to improve procedures and
adjust incentives. Establishment of user associations and maintenance funds is the best way
to assure upkeep until local government resources and management abilities strengthen; still,
considerable tollow-up and training are required.
(c)  The participation of beneficiaries in the design of a credit program  can lead to greater
ownership and reduced risk.  In Albania, village intermediation, using village-level
solidarity, can very effectively limit the risk of small credit.
(d) The pilot project's bottom-up approach for rural infrastructure rehabilitation created some
competition and bureaucratic rivalries with the central government ministries that advocate
and pursue a top-down approach. Soime ministries have appeared to he resentful of the
ADF's low costs for rural works and its flexibility and quickness.
(e) While ADF's status as an autonomous agency was critical tor the pilot project's ability to
act quickly, it has also created resistance from  some government staff, especially because
the ADF operates outside of the government salary framework.  ADF's status as an
autonomous institution remains an issue that must be kept under review.
(t)  Difficulties experienced in establishing "common facility centers" have led to a reorientation
of the microenterprise component in favor of demandl-dlriven technical and business advice
in coordination with the credit component.



- 7 -
(g) Given the almost complete lack of knowledge in Albania of western-style accounting and
management practices, more resources should be allocated from the outset of the project for
strengthening the financial and administrative structure of the implementing institution.
This area is now being addressed under the pilot project, and would be further addressed
during the proposed full-scale project.
(h) The size of the project's Special Account must be adequate to accommodate peak
disbursement periods during the spring and summer, and further training should be provided
to project finance staff in replenishment procedures. Although IDA disbursements under
the RPAPP are more than 100 percent ahead of schedule, disbursements would have been
even higher had it not been for periodic lack of funds.
(i) Project staff must be highly motivated, dedicated to the project's socioeconomic objects, and
open to innovation and change; staff recruitment must be based on professional criteria and
personal motivation. Following recruitment, a trial period with in-the-field training has
proven to be an effective way to test and train candidates for the credit and rural works
components.
19.    The RPAPP has proven to be highly replicable within Albania and a magnet for attracting foreign
aid to Albania. On December 3, 1993, the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD)
approved the Northeastern Districts Rural Development Project (NDRDP), most of which will be
implemented through a northeastern branch of the ADF. The project, which was declared effective on
April 19, 1994, amounts to US$18 million over six years, of which US$13 million will be used for RDF
activities in the districts of Diber, Kukes, Has, and Tropoje; separate new activities are therefore not
needed in these districts. The NDRDP is financed by IFAD and the Islamic Development Bank, which
will support the rural works component. Also, an Italian trust fund was established at the World Bank
in early 1994 for the disbursement of approximately US$2.35 million in Italian funds for ADF activities
as an extension to the pilot phase.
20.    An urban counterpart to the RPAPP was appraised in April 1994. The proposed Urban Works
and Microenterprise Pilot Project would test urban infrastructure works, small credit, and microenterprise
support in selected municipalities for eighteen months. A "pre-pilot" phase started in early 1994 using
funds from the Japanese Government, the UNDP, and a Swiss NGO.
21.    Project Objectives. The project's main objectives are: (a) to promote small farm and off-farm
activities and help create a rural market economy; (b) to repair basic rural infrastructure; and (c) to create
employment for the rural population and inject cash resources into rural households.
22.    Project Description. The Rural Development Project, which would be implemented over three
years, consists of the following components:
(a) Rural Infrastructure Works (Base Cost US$5.0 million-44%): The project would finance
approximately 190 rural infrastructure subprojects, which would include rehabilitating ex-
cooperative dirt roads, repairing or extending village water supply or irrigations systems,
repairing schools and health centers, and establishing new market facilities. Villages would
select subprojects based on established criteria. ADF staff would evaluate subprojects and,
if approved, contracts would be signed with the communes defining work programs, timing,
cost estimates, and future maintenance. When feasible, communes would select, using local
shopping, construction contractors; otherwise, communes would hire unemployed village



- 8 -
labor to carry out the works, and would  use local shopping procedures for procuring
materials and transport, which typically represent 70 percent of total project cost. ADF
engineers would oversee subproject implementation and provide assistance, when necessary.
Three main criteria would he used to select subpro jects: economic and social impact; (legree
of labor intensity; and sustainahility by local organizations.
(b) Small-Scale Credit (Base Cost lJS$4.3 million-39%):  The project would extend the
existing village credit fund (VCF) network and would finance small loans to over 9,000
farmers and rural entrepreneurs by estahlishing about 135 new VCFs. Includling VCFs
established under the pilot project, the ADF wouldl oversee some 210 VCFs. and about
12,000 small credits would he granted in the three-year project period.  VCFs-to he
deposited at the local Rural Commercial Bank--would he managed by village credit
committees (VCC), of which a representative of the ADF would be an ex-officio member.
The VCCs would decide on credit allocations, (letine collateral, and control the repayment
of loans. Under the project, loans woulld be gradually shifted to a real positive lek-hased
interest rate. In order to provide for a transition from  a dollar-based to a lek-based interest
rate; the initial lek-based interest rate wouldl he 10( percelit for one year, which is the IMF
pro jected inflation rate for 1995. Arrangements tfor the transition from a dollar-hased rate
to a lek-based rate satisfactory to the Bank were disCussedl duLring negotiations, an(d thle ADF
formally approved these arrangements in Janluary 1995.
The component's broader objective would he to prepare the creation of a sustainable
financial institution based on a Raiffeisen-type credit/savings system.  Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that the Governmen1t would finalize the post-project status of the
VCF network, which takes account of coniditions at the timie and is acceptable to IDA, by
June 30, 1997.
(c) Promotion of Rural Activities (BaseCost JUS$0.4 million--3%): The projectwould organize
business and technical a(dvice to approximately 600 microentrepreneurs via a network of
trained local consultants. This advisory service wouldl woirk in coordination with village
credit funds in order to create synergy-hut not compulsory inter-dependence-between credit
and bhusiness advice.  Also in coordinationi with village credit funds, the project would
promote anrd support the establishment of village animial health associations in order to
improve prophylaxis.  Other activities to be supportedL un(ler the component inclulde
marketing and technical studies for key subsectors an(d establishment of a data hase on small
techinologies.
(d)  Stutdies and( Local (Governimient Training (l3ase Cost US$0.2 million-2%):  Beneficiary
assessment studies would be funded to evaluate project inmpact and to guide project
conmponents. The project woulld provide see(d tundinlg tfor training and study tours to help
equip Alhania's rural local goveriiinenit with the skills necessary for local development.
(e)  Implementation SuLpport (Base Cost US$1.3 mnillion-12%): TIhe project would ftinance the
investment and recurrent costs of the Albanian Development Fund.
23.    Prject Area. The Rural Development Project would support ADF activities in 14 districts,
representing the poorest and miost mountainous districts of Albania's 36 districts. With the exception ot
one district, Puke, the ADF is already active in the project area. The rural works component would he
implemented in 12 districts-Berat, Bulqlize, Elbasan, Grarnsh, Librazhid, Malesi e Madhe, Mat, Mirdite,



-9-
Puke, Shkoder, Skraper, Tirana, and Vlore-and the small credit and promotion of rural activities
comilponents would intervene in 7 districts-Elbasan, Gramsh, Kruje, Librazhd, Puke, Tirana, an(d Vlore.
The IFAD-financed Northeastern Districts Rural Development Project is supporting ADF activities in tfur
additional districts-Diber, Has, Kukes, and Tropoje.
24.    Project Implementation. The proposed project would be carried out by the ADF, which is the
successor to the RDF (para. 17 and footnote 2). This transformation is being accompanied hy a change
in the internal organization of the institution, as well as strengthening of its financial and administrative
calpacity. The ADF has proven its ability to manage the program  effectively and efficiently.  The
proposed 190 rural works and 135 VCFs over three years represent a core program that can he very
easily managed. If suLpplemental cofinancing is obtained, the full-scale program of 375 rural works and
300 VCFs are considered within ADF's institutional capacity.
25.    The project cost is estimated at US$12 million, with a foreign exchange comrponent of US$2.2
millilon equivalent. The Bank would finance US$6.0 million equivalent, 50 percent of the total project
costs. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and metho(ds
of procurement and of dishursements, and the disbLirsement schedtile are shown in Scheduile B. A
timetable of key pro 'ject processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the Albania are
given in Schedtiles C and D, respectively. Two maps are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
13156-ALB dated January 10, 1995, is heing distribLite(d separately.
26.    Rationalef ir Bank Involvement. The project ;b, basically an extension of a successful pilot phase.
It retlects the developiment priorities tformulated in the Country Assistance Strategy tor Albania, as
discussed by the Board in August 1993, by addressing poverty and privatization.  It provides a
com-pleinentary microeconomic and social approach to the IDA-supported Agriculture Sector Adjtistment
('redit.
27.    Agreements Reached. Agreement was reached on the following during negotiations:
(a)  Government would appoint an Executive Director of the Albanian Development Fund, as
well as any subsequent successors during the project period, whose experience and
qualifications are acceptahle to IDA;
(b) the Regulations and Operational Manuals to be used by the Albanian Development Fund for
the Rural Developiment Project would be acceptable to IDA, and any changes to these
manuals woulld be mande in consultation with, and with the approval of, IDA;
(c)  work plans and budgets for project activities, which would include specific proposals for the
use of Government's contribution, would he prepared annually for review by IDA;
(d) the Albanian Development Fund would maintain accounting practices acceptable to IDA,
including satisfactory provisions tor periodic reporting, and an annual audit would he
undertaken by international qualified independent auditors acceptable to IDA;
(e) the Albanian Development Fund would submit to IDA quarterly reports on project activities,
in a format acceptable to IDA;



- 10 -
(t) the Albanian Development Fund would undertake jointly with IDA a mid-term evaluation
of the project no later than August 31, 1996; and
(g) the Government would finalize the post-project status of the village credit fund network and
the rural works and promotion of rural activities components, acceptable to IDA, by June
30, 1997.
28.    Condition of Effectiveness. The execution of a subsidiary agreement between the Ministry of
Finance and the Albanian Development Fund, under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, would he
a condition of effectiveness of the IDA credit.
29.    Environmental Aspects. The project has been assigned a category "B" environmental rating and
would be subject to analysis, although adverse environnmental impact is unlikely given the small size of
subprojects financed under the project. During the pilot project, environmental guidelines and checklists
were developed for rural works subprojects. Although checklists were for a time not completed, they
are now being used and could help increase the environmental awareness of local government officials.
30.    Program Objective Categories. Although not all project components contain specific mechanisms
for targeting the least well off, it is expected, given the nature of the project and its components, that the
population of project beneficiaries would have a larger proportion of poor people than the population as
a whole.  Consequently, the project would be rated as "Poverty Category: Program  for Targeted
Interventions" in accordance with the provisions of OD 4.15.
31.    Participatory Approach. The project emphasizes a participatory and process (phased) approach.
DLuring the pre-pilot and pilot phases, the organization of the rural works, the village credit delivery
mechianism, and all contractual arrangements were worked out in continuous dialogue with village and
coommune representatives, the Rural Commercial Bank, and potential borrowers.  The continued
participation of project beneficiaries and stakeholders is considered essential for further developing,
adjusting, and improving upon project methods, as well as for the sustainability and success of project
activities.
32.    Project Benefits. Direct and immediate benefits would flow from the labor-intensive rural works,
which would create over 550,000 man-days of employment, injecting badly needed cash resources into
the economy. In addition, rehabilitation of infrastructure-roads, water supply, irrigation, schools, and
health centers-would provide the necessary environment for increased trade and market activity, and
would improve the quality of rural life. Direct benefits would also accrue to the 135 villages given access
to small-scale credit through village credit funds, and activities to support microenterprises would help
to restart market small-scale agricultural processing and off-farm activities.
33.    Risks. The risks of the project are minimized by its process approach, which provides for
continuous feedback and adjustment. Furthermore, project components have already been tested during
the pilot phase-the rural works component is proceeding well, and village intermediation has proved an
efficient mechanism to limit the risk of small-scale credit. Activities to support microenterprises began
only recently, but their risks are limited by the small size of the component. The ADF has proven its
ability to manage the program, although there is a risk in overloading the ADF with too many parallel
projects financed by different donors. There is also a risk of political interference, which could increase
as the project grows in size. Management and political risks would be minimized by granting special
attention to project organization and management, as well as to written procedures and regulations.

34.    Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
