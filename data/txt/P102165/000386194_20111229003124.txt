                          xii
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. In 2006-07, there was global concern about the threat of highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI). The magnitude and nature of this threat was detailed in the Global Program for Avian Influenza
(GPAI) Project Framework Document: at the time of project formulation, avian influenza was having
huge, deleterious economic effects on the world’s poultry industry. There was concurrent, grave concern
about human infection with influenza A virus of avian origin and its potential to cause a catastrophic
human pandemic if the H5N1 strain of HPAI was not effectively controlled in poultry and people, and if
it mutated to be highly infectious between humans.

2. HPAI outbreaks had been confirmed in countries neighboring Kosovo. HPAI had occurred in
Albania in domestic poultry in 2006; in Bosnia and Herzegovina in wild swans; in Bulgaria in wild birds;
in Croatia in wild swans; in Serbia and Montenegro in wild birds and backyard poultry; and in Romania
in poultry. Kosovo was vulnerable to introduction of the virus from imports of infected poultry products
from neighboring territories: although imports were officially banned by the Kosovo Veterinary and
Food Agency (KVFA) during 2006, 96 percent of Kosovo’s poultry meat had been previously imported. 1
Kosovo was also susceptible to virus introduction from movements and migration of wild birds.

3. Kosovo had susceptible poultry and human populations. The avian population at risk was
estimated to be 2.6 million birds in 2005.2 Moreover, only about 25 percent of poultry were in industrial-
type egg farms; around 75 percent were reared on roughly 113,000 small, rural farms and roughly 1.3
million of the estimated human population of two million lived in rural areas. Around half of all rural
households owned poultry, with an average flock size of 19 birds. Thus, there was a substantial human
population at potential risk of infection from infected poultry.

4. There was a need to strengthen national veterinary and public health services to enhance their
ability to prevent and control HPAI. The Kosovo Provisional Institutions of Self Government (PISG)
had received support from the international donor community since 2005 to improve planning,
surveillance and control measures for HPAI. The Office of the Prime Minister was empowered to
oversee preparedness and planning. 3 The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development
(MAFRD) and the Ministry of Health (MoH) were vested with responsibilities for preparedness and
response activities within the veterinary and human health sectors, respectively. An Avian Influenza
Working Group was established and three HPAI-related plans were produced, with the assistance of the
World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the United
Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK). The United Nations International Children’s Fund
(UNICEF) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) also provided assistance to prepare
Kosovo to deal with an outbreak, and the European Union (EU) provided assistance in laboratory design
and construction. However, to ensure Kosovo’s capacity to prevent HPAI and respond effectively, needs
were identified in key areas: institutional strengthening, capacity-building, increasing public awareness
and increased resources including compensation funds in case of the necessity to pay farmers for culling
their stock. These interventions were beyond the mandate of the above-mentioned organizations and
beyond the PISG’s resources.

5. The World Bank was able to bring critical assistance to these efforts in the form of an
International Development Association (IDA) grant. In addition, with its experience in assisting countries
under the GPAI umbrella, the Bank was able to draw on valuable lessons learned from other countries
facing similar threats and operating in similar environments. It also had important operational experience
in mounting emergency response grant financing, and in coordinating the efforts of other agencies into an
integrated response by the national authorities.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
6. The original PDO was to strengthen the Government of Kosovo’s capacity to prevent the spread of
avian influenza among poultry, to prevent the transmission of avian influenza from birds to other animals
and humans, and to prepare for a potential pandemic of avian influenza transmissible between humans.

7. The key project outcome indicators were:

    With regard to Public Awareness and Information:
        Targeted population (poultry producers, veterinary and health personnel) and general
           population are aware of the HPAI threat and practice measures to protect themselves and
           others from HPAI (baseline survey to be conducted at beginning of project).

    With regard to Animal Health, measures are in place such that if there is an outbreak of HPAI among
    poultry:
        Kosovo Veterinary Laboratory identifies the presence of HPAI;
        The PISG cull birds at the infection point and establish a protection zone, with participation
             of local governments and the population;
        The PISG compensate farmers for culled birds in a timely manner.

    With regard to Human Health, measures are in place such that if there is an HPAI outbreak among
    humans:
        Infection is diagnosed and contained
        Patients receive appropriate treatment for HPAI infection

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

8. The project was restructured (see Project Paper dated December 18, 2009). The revised PDO was to
minimize the threat posed to humans by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) infection and other
zoonoses to prepare for, control, and respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease
emergencies in humans.

9. Revised key indicators were:

    With regard to Public Awareness and Information:
        Targeted population (poultry producers, veterinary and health personnel) and general
           population are aware of the HPAI, A/H1N1 and other zoonoses threat and practice measures
           to protect themselves and others.

    With regard to Animal Health, measures are in place such that if there is an outbreak of HPAI or
    other zoonotic disease in livestock population:
         Kosovo Veterinary laboratory identifies the presence of the disease;
         Government culls infected or at-risk animals, compensates promptly, and takes effective
            control and safeguard measures;


                                                    2
           Government operates efficient epidemio-surveillance in the field.

    With regard to Human Health:
        Patients receive appropriate treatment for HPAI infection
        Adequate preventive measures in place

10. The reasons for revision and project restructuring were that: (i) the country never faced an HPAI
outbreak between inception and the time of the mid-term review: (ii) the compensation fund had not been
utilized; and (iii) the government was simultaneously dealing with animal diseases of public health
concern other than HPAI. In particular, concern had grown for another A/influenza serotype, H1N1, and
WHO had raised the pandemic alert to level 6. Therefore, the Minister of AFRD and the Permanent
Secretary of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) formally requested the Bank to broaden the
scope of the project. Major project overhaul was not necessary to accommodate this request as many of
the activities intended for HPAI control were applicable to prevention and control of other zoonoses.
Restructuring enabled more efficient use of Bank resources already committed in this project to Kosovo.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11. The main beneficiaries were rural households who kept backyard poultry (estimated at appraisal
to be 113,000 families) who would be most affected in the event of an HPAI outbreak. In particular,
women and children involved with feeding hens and egg collection would be at high risk of exposure to
HPAI. Loss of income and nutrition from poultry products would have been an inevitable consequence of
HPAI outbreaks and stamping out measures.

12. The majority of the half million head of poultry in the commercial sector (estimated at appraisal as
117 farms out of total 122 farms) was managed on medium size poultry farms with 1,000 to 10,000
birds per farm (mean 3,600 birds per farm). The effects of an HPAI outbreak would be strongly felt on
these small farms, not only the effect on farms directly affected, but on all others due to likely market
shocks as consumers turned away from consumption of poultry products.

13. After restructuring, the main beneficiaries were the wider population of Kosovo who were
susceptible to A/H1N1 flu (colloquially known as “swine flu?) and other zoonoses that the PDO had been
broadened to address. They stood to benefit from enhanced capacity for prevention and response to
disease as well as enhanced capacity to treat human disease. The project became less specifically targeted
to people involved with the poultry sector, and more targeted to a wider population susceptible to a range
of diseases.

1.5 Original Components

The four original components were:

14. Component 1: Public Awareness and Information (US$283,500) aimed to help develop and
implement a communications plan to inform the public, particularly those more likely to be exposed to
HPAI, about the threat of HPAI and how they could minimize the risk of transmission and spread of
disease. Its two subcomponents are: (i) Risk Communication, and (ii) Communication for Behavior
Change.

15. Component 2: Animal Health (US$1,471,900) aimed to support a national program to develop and
implement short and long term HPAI prevention, containment, and control and eradication activities in
animals. Its three subcomponents are: (i) Enhancing HPAI Prevention and Preparedness Capacity; (ii)




                                                    3
Strengthening Disease Control Capacities, and Improving Surveillance, Diagnostic Capacities, and
Applied Research; and (iii) Strengthen HPAI Control Programs and Outbreak Containment Programs.

16. Component 3: Human Health (US$968,500) aimed to support a national program to develop and
implement short- and medium-term prevention of an outbreak of HPAI among humans and reduce the
impact of pandemic virus. Its subcomponents are: (i) Enhance Coordination and Program Planning; (ii)
Strengthen the National Public Health Surveillance System; and (iii) Strengthen Health Care Response
Capacity.

17. Component 4: Project Implementation and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) (US$276,100)
was to (i) Provide Support to the Project Team through strengthening capacities of existing staff assigned
to the project and (ii) support M&E through training and supporting program monitoring.

1.6 Revised Components

18. After restructuring, the four components remained, but activities were revised. Additional
activities to support the revised PDO were: (Restructuring Paper, December 18, 2009.)

      i.   Public Awareness and Information component: aim to address remaining knowledge gaps
           within the population on A/H1N1, influenza-like diseases, and other zoonoses.

     ii.   Animal Health component: (i) finance necessary wastewater treatment for the Animal Health
           Laboratory (AH Lab) currently under construction; (ii) finance equipment, consumables, and
           furniture to make the AH Lab fully functional and responsive to Kosovo’s current and
           forecasted laboratory diagnostic needs.

    iii.   Human Health component: (i) support pandemic response, including the recently declared
           Pandemic level 6 alert, and scale up hospital preparedness and health sector response capacity;
           (ii) support additional measures to ensure adequate stocks of lab reagents, disinfectants, and
           personal protective equipment are available; (iii) revise the National Pandemic Preparedness
           Plan, prepared by the Institute of Public Health (IPH) in September 2008, according to WHO
           recommendations; (iv) capitalize on completed and ongoing activities, in particular to raise
           preparedness in the regions related to the diagnosis, referrals, and management of outbreaks
           and Pandemic.

    iv.    The Project would expand the scope of training and technical assistance activities to broaden
           capacity building primarily for human health but also for animal health. In particular activities
           focused on emergency management, triage, field epidemiology, clinical management and
           laboratory diagnosis of important diseases, especially zoonoses.

1.7 Other significant changes

19. The project was extended twice: first, by eight months from April 30 to December 31, 2010; and
again by six months to June 30, 2011. National resources were made available for compensation
purposes.4 The Compensation Fund allocation (US$537,300 equivalent) was redirected to finance the
adjusted Project scope, especially the activities under the Human and Animal Health components and for
activities that exceeded cost estimations. There was a reallocation of the Grant proceeds from “Eligible
Emergency Imports? (EEI) to “Goods, Works, and Consultants’ Services?. EEI was reduced from

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20. The project was a rational response to Kosovo’s specific needs in the context of the global
concern for mitigating a potential human influenza pandemic. The influenza A/H5N1 virus in birds was
circulating in neighboring Balkan countries including confirmed isolations of the virus in domestic and
wild species. The analysis carried out during project preparation built on the Bank’s expertise in assisting
other countries under the GPAI umbrella and was consistent with the GPAI Program Appraisal Document
(PAD). Thus, the design was a modification of a Bank template used successfully in a number of
countries: the project’s PDO and components were replicated and adjusted to fit Kosovo’s needs.

21. The project was consistent with the Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Kosovo, 2009. 6 The ISN
described a targeted support program that included activities to support social cohesion through
governance reform involving: (i) support for the creation of strong, transparent institutions; (ii) fostering
inter-ethnic cooperation; and (iii) increasing access to social services. The animal and human health
components of the project were to help strengthen institutions and increase access to veterinary and health
services, and the public awareness component recognized the need to be inclusive of all ethnic groups.

22. The government actively participated in project design through consultation with the Avian
Influenza Working Group (AIWG), the Office of the Prime Minister and line Ministries. The government
agreed that the line Ministries, MAFRD and MoH, would support project management, coordination and
M&E. The government further agreed that the AIWG would: (i) be maintained with sufficient technical
and financial resources throughout the life of the project; (ii) report monthly to the Office of the Prime
Minister; (iii) be chaired by the Deputy Minister of MAFRD; and (iv) have inter-ministerial membership.
Further, the government agreed that a Project Team would be established within MAFRD and be
responsible for project coordination and management, including financial management, annual work
programming, implementing poultry culling compensation, M&E and financial reporting and audit.

23. The project was conceived as an emergency project to span over three years (instead of the more
typical five-year Bank project duration). The Operational Manual (OM) included all Terms of References
(TORs) of specific tasks and Technical Specifications up front for items such as protective gear,
disinfectants for hospitals and for airports and border points, so as not to waste time if there was an
outbreak. The project was prepared in only four months due to the emergency circumstances, which is
commendable.

24. UNICEF, WHO and FAO were represented in the Bank team that appraised and negotiated the
project. This may have facilitated the good cooperation with these agencies later during implementation:
they also assisted with project supervision.

strategy were valid at project preparation.

25. Risks critical to the sustainability of the project were clearly identified in the Technical Annex,
which replaces the PAD for this project. A feasible mitigation measure was described for each critical
risk. For example, for the critical risk of lack of coordination in minority enclaves, agreement was
reached with WHO and UNICEF to provide support on behalf of the government to the project’s public
awareness and information and human health components in North Mitrovica. Problems associated with
outreach to beneficiaries from ethnic minorities, such as the Serb population, were identified at appraisal.

2.2 Implementation

26. With commitment from the authorities, the project achieved its objectives. Despite the change
from UNMIK to the Republic of Kosovo administration during the life of the project, the relevant line
ministries continued to support project implementation throughout. Implementation experienced some
delay as a result of the changes in government and broader political developments with Kosovo status
(declaration of independence).

27. UN agencies, including WHO, FAO and UNICEF, played key supportive roles. Cooperation
between the Bank project team and UN agencies was described as ‘excellent’ by heads of agencies. Legal
requirements for contractual agreements between UN agencies (WHO, UNICEF) and the Bank proved
cumbersome and unworkable and so were effectively resolved by local agreement. UNICEF and WHO
agreed to take over project activities in minority areas and finance them from their own resources.7 WHO
(i) enabled project access in minority areas, (ii) contributed its own funds for hardware and software for
regional IPH offices, and (iii) translated communicable disease surveillance software into Serbian. FAO
made a major contribution to animal health training through workshops with international experts, filling
a gap in the Bank’s technical assistance and creating synergies. UNICEF (i) facilitated procurement of
antiviral drugs and seasonal flu vaccine, and (ii) cooperated with implementing the communications
component, particularly in minority areas.8

28. Nevertheless, prior to the Mid-Term Review (MTR) in February 2009 the project’s overall
implementation rating was ‘moderately unsatisfactory’. Problems arose early in implementation due
to strain caused by the additional project-associated workload on top of Component Coordinators’ pre-
existing responsibilities. Project Supervision missions reported implementation problems with
procurement and project management. A key reason for this was staff changes in the Project Team,
including the Lead Project Coordinator who had changed twice prior to the MTR, and other key staff in
procurement, financial management and monitoring and evaluation who were replaced. At the time of the
MTR, financial management was ‘marginally satisfactory’. Project management weaknesses were
resolved with frequent meetings, and coordination of the project team.

29. The project was planned as an emergency project from the outset, but during implementation it
was decided that it was not an emergency project. Momentum declined due to the perception that avian
influenza was a diminishing global problem.9

30. The project was restructured. The reasons for this were: (i) there was no HPAI outbreak in Kosovo
and compensation funds were not utilized; and (ii) the GPAI had been revised and the project no longer
complied with its broader scope. Therefore, funds allocated for compensation were reallocated to
implement other activities. These changes were implemented very effectively, enabling Kosovo to cope
well with the A/H1N1 “swine flu? pandemic later in the project.

31. There was good interaction between different technical sectors. Human health and veterinary
sector cooperation strengthened effective implementation of public health aspects. This was illustrated by
public awareness campaign cooperation: from the beginning of the project, Food and Veterinary Agency
personnel were included in the IPH Commission for Health Promotion and Education.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

32. Design. A detailed results framework (RF) (original and revised), and the associated arrangements for
monitoring, addressed the PDO. During restructuring, the indicators were modified to meet the revised
PDO, and were broadly consistent with GPAI standards and expectations. The RF was revised, but the
intervention logic of the project at restructuring is incomplete in the Restructuring Paper’s RF.
Specifically, the Restructuring Paper Data Sheet states expected outcomes of the project (that is, (i) a
National Integrated Preparedness Plan (NIPP) for control and response to outbreaks and pandemics in
accordance with WHO recommendations, and (ii) a contained and diminishing pattern of HPAI and other
viral threats and infections in humans), but Annex 4 --Results Framework and Monitoring does not give
the revised Project Outcome Indicators that relate to these outcomes. In any case, the NIPP is arguably a
project output rather than an outcome. Despite this apparent omission in the annexed RF, the justification
for support to the NIPP is clearly explained in the Restructuring Paper text.

33. Implementation and Utilization. Overall responsibility for M&E was with the Project Coordinators
and ministerial staff in the MAFRD and in MoH/IPH. M&E was implemented by one of the
epidemiologists hired for Veterinary Epidemiology Unit under the Animal Health component from the
start of the project. Besides his tasks as epidemiologist, the M&E officer collected data from line
ministries and other implementation agencies and compiled this data into semi-annual or quarterly
progress reports, focusing on status of physical implementation by component, use of project funds and
monitoring indicators.

34. The M&E reporting experienced interruptions and severe delays due to staff changes and
underperformance. 10 During its supervision missions, the Bank repeatedly emphasized the need to focus
on the results framework/ monitoring indicators and took all necessary steps to fill gaps in the result
framework, including hiring a consultant in January 2011 after the M&E expert left the position
(September, 2010) . Despite the best efforts of the M&E officer, as well as training he received in Vienna
and in Tirana, the M&E reporting remained erratic throughout the project (see section 2.3). 11 The change
and lack of staffing towards the end of the project life (see section 2.2, above) undermined the effective
use of the M&E system for proper guidance for actions to the main stakeholders. The M&E performance
has been erratic, underperforming both in terms of acceptable quality level, and in terms of delays in
delivery.12 Result framework monitoring for every year of the project was produced with severe delay.

35. Two KAP surveys were conducted, in 2008 and 2010 to assess behavioral changes in the population
and the target groups. The first KAP survey was about public perception of AI and was used as baseline

   See ISR, #/3, 09/29/2008. Project reporting and M&E have been done with delays and partially served as
guidance to the PT for actions. See also ISR, #/4, 06/15/2009. The M&E position was vacant for two months. The
epidemiologist/M&E officer was hired in April 2009 to provide detailed comments on the annual report and project
result framework prepared by the experts. He left in September 2010 for another position in MAFRD.

for project monitoring and evaluation.13 The follow-up survey (2010) was used for guiding the design of
future training programs according to the needs highlighted by the first survey.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

36. Overall safeguards compliance is rated as satisfactory throughout the project’s life. The Project
Operational Manual included an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), which was found satisfactory.
The Project team undertook the Environmental Assessment (EA) and subsequent update of the existing
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) to include the Veterinary Laboratory construction, in confirming
the ownership status of the site, approval of final designs and tendering of civil works (April-Sept
2009).14 In addition, the Social Assessment indicated no social safeguard issues. The project was regularly
supervised by FM and Procurement Specialists at the World Bank country office in Albania and by HQ
staff later on. Audit reports were delivered on time and were not qualified.

37. The Financing Agreement was negotiated in SDR and costs in the project Technical Annex are in
USD, which created confusion for the implementation team in Kosovo’s Euro economy. Nevertheless,
the project successfully disbursed 99.59 percent of the proceeds: US$3,082,441.28 was disbursed out of
total budget US$3,095,110.18. It managed this disbursement even though the project gained money in
two ways. First, the project budget grew by US$95,110.18 due to USD to SDR exchange rate fluctuation.
Second, savings of US$50,400 were made because WHO and UNICEF utilized their own funds to assist
with project access to minority areas.

38. The Bank prior-reviewed every procurement package for four-and-a-half years instead of 12 months,
due to the country’s high corruption risk, low procurement capacity and PM staff changes. This placed
extra demands on the Bank team, including on the procurement staff that provided the needed safeguards.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

39. The government demonstrated strong commitment throughout implementation, which bodes well for
the future: with the Ministry of Finance and Economy’s close cooperation all (99.59 percent) of project
funds were disbursed by March 2011. Good working relations between the human and animal health
sector developed during project implementation and will continue into the future. Component 1, Public
Awareness and Communication, should be sustained through the continuing supervision of the
Communications Working Group, with veterinary sector representation, in the MoH at IPH.

40. Under Component 2, Animal Health, a team of epidemiologists has been established. The FVA itself
has a 2011 budget allocation of Euro 1,200,000. Similarly for Component 3, Human Health, plans have
been made for state budget provision both for the IPH laboratory kits and reagents, and for the ICU,
which have been allocated Euro 100,000 and 45,000 respectively (Borrower’s Report – see Executive
Summary in appendix). The IPH also derives some income for laboratory services (see Section 4).

41. The Project was implemented through existing governmental institutions, namely the FVA, the IPH,
and the Pristina University Hospital, in line with the PISG plan for implementation of HPAI preparedness
and response measures. While mainstreaming of the project in the relevant Government institutions

   See Borrower’s ICR 2011. The first KAP survey included 800 respondents of general population, 100 healthcare
staff, and 100 students and in qualitative target population, which included 20 teachers, 20 farmers, 20
distributors/traders, and 10 journalists. This survey was undertaken in all large municipalities of Kosovo such as
Ferizaj, Gjilan, Gjakova, Peja, Mitrovica, Pristina and Prizren. The field work was done during October-December.

   See Aide Memoire, September 23-29, 2009. As a result of the MTR mission recommendation, the Bank
Environment Specialist and the Social Specialist visited the Veterinary Laboratory site and supervised the process.

slowed down the initial project implementation, it resulted in a strong ownership of all the actors involved,
and commitment to efficiency in completing project activities and the use of the resources allocated.
Project sustainability is ensured through the increased demand for the new efficient services (new testing
methods in IPH), enhanced staff skills through trainings, and the incorporation of Operation and
Maintenance for laboratory diagnostics and ICU into the state budget allocation.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

42. The PDO is relevant to the Global Program for Avian Influenza (GPAI). After restructuring, the
PDO was made more relevant to the global threat of other emerging zoonotic diseases, in accordance with
the revised GPAI. The revised PDO is consistent with the principles of the ‘One World, One Health’
Strategic Framework for reducing the risk of emerging infectious diseases, endorsed by four specialized
agencies.15 The revised PDO, and redistribution of project funds intended for farmer compensation in the
event of poultry culling during outbreaks, made project fund utilization more relevant to the ‘no HPAI
outbreaks’ scenario.

43. The project is consistent with the Kosovo Interim Strategy Note (2009). Specifically, it fits with
Bank policy in terms of supporting creation of strong institutions (hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and
epidemiology units), fostering inter-ethnic cooperation (inclusion of ethnic minority groups in public
awareness raising and training), and increasing access to social services (improved access to health care).

44. The central element of the original PDO remains valid, that is, to minimize the threat to humans
from HPAI, as the risk of this contingency continues up to and beyond project completion. The PDO also
concerns preparation, response and control of influenza epidemics and other infectious disease
emergencies in humans. The relevance of this in terms of both design and implementation was clearly
demonstrated by the efficient response to the H1N1 influenza pandemic that occurred during the latter
part of the life of the project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

45. This section provides evidence of the mechanisms through which project interventions resulted in
successful final outcomes to, in turn, achieve the PDO. The three basic elements of the original PDO were
to: (i) prevent AI spread among poultry; (ii) prevent transmission of AI from birds to other animals and
humans; and (iii) prepare for potential human pandemic and AI transmission between humans. The basic
elements of the revised PDO were to: (i) minimize the threat of zoonoses; and (ii) prepare for and control
zoonotic disease emergencies in humans.

46. Three primary outputs were expected to benefit the designated beneficiaries by producing outcomes
that enable the PDO to be achieved. These three primary outputs/project activities were: (i) effective
communication; (ii) support to the veterinary sector; and (iii) support to the human health sector.

47. At restructuring, the project aim was broadened from solely the HPAI threat to encompass
minimizing the threats of influenza A/H1N1 and other zoonoses as well. At restructuring, Components 1,
2 and 3 had additional activities assigned to them to reflect the broader PDO; Component 4 remained
largely unchanged. For detailed outputs, see Annex 2 on Outputs by Component. Figures 1 and 2 below
illustrate causal linkages from output to PDO before and after project restructuring.

                                 expressed clearly in the
                                 Restructuring Paper, Annex 4].



48. Stage 1: Achievement of the PDO through creating greater awareness of disease and behavior
change. A comprehensive public awareness and communication campaign was conducted under
Component 1. The two main areas of activity were Risk Communication and Communication for
Behavior Change. The target audience was poultry producers, veterinary and health personnel, but the
general population was also expected to become aware of the HPAI threat and to change behavior to
protect themselves and others.

49. Output – Effective communication. Before restructuring, effective communication referred to
information related solely to HPAI. After the project was restructured, other zoonoses were covered,
particularly influenza A/H1N1. Output included a comprehensive range of communication materials (see
Annex 2) coordinated with the Interagency Communications Working Group, whose members included
Government, the UN team and the media.

50. Outcome – Greater awareness of HPAI and behavior change. Two Knowledge, Attitude and
Practices (KAP) surveys were carried out using the same methodology: one in 2008 and a second one in


                                                 10
2010.16 In 2008 the project was concerned only with HPAI. Therefore, using the reported findings,
comparison can only be made with awareness and behavior change with regard to HPAI. The KAP survey
findings are summarized in Annex 2. They show that awareness increased, for example: 9 percent (1
percent in 2008) of the general population received information through brochures, posters, and leaflets;
88 percent (72 percent, in 2008) was aware that AI is caused by a virus; and 24 percent of the general
population was aware that symptoms of AI included fever, sweating and coughing. The survey findings
also provide some evidence for behavior change, for example: 22 percent (16 percent in 2008) wash
their hands after touching poultry or poultry products; 31 percent (22 percent 2008) cook poultry products
well; and 33 percent (32 percent 2008) avoid contact with dead poultry and wild birds. 100 percent
uptake of seasonal flu vaccination by Public Health personnel is further evidence of high awareness
achieved and a resulting behavioral decision to be vaccinated.

51. Stage 2: Achievement of the PDO through enhanced veterinary laboratory diagnosis; and
controlling poultry outbreaks including culling and compensation and effective epidemio-
surveillance. This area focused on: (i) Enhancing HPAI Prevention and Preparedness Capacity; (ii)
Strengthening Disease Control Capacities, and Improving Surveillance, Diagnostic Capacities, and
Applied Research; and (iii) Strengthening HPAI Control Programs and Outbreak Containment Programs.

52. Output – before restructuring Veterinary sector support with epidemiology unit staff salaried and
active; after restructuring Veterinary laboratory built and equipped; epidemiology unit well trained.
Activities in this stage included training veterinary personnel, strengthening laboratory diagnostic
capacity, and bringing the epidemiology unit to a fully functioning state, that is, technical assistance and
training, improved surveillance and reporting, transport for field epidemiologists and a full complement
of staff.

53. Outcome – before restructuring Poultry HPAI identified by laboratory; outbreaks controlled,
including culling and compensation; after restructuring Veterinary laboratory identifies the disease;
culling, compensation and effective control measures; efficient epidemio-surveillance. HPAI did not
occur during the project and, therefore, neither could HPAI be identified by the laboratory, nor could
outbreaks be controlled. Although delayed until late in the project, by the end of the project the means to
test samples in-country was in place: in particular, an upgraded animal health laboratory was provided
with RT-PCR technology and staffed by a skilled technician competent to test samples with this
technology; and efficient epidemio-surveillance was achieved. At restructuring, the PDO was broadened
to include other zoonotic diseases, but the identity of “the disease? stated in the revised outcome was not
specified. 17 After abolishing the project compensation fund component (at restructuring, the Bank
received guaranties of the availability of the CF), a government compensation fund was established,
backed up by legislation before the project start, with the means for rapid compensation of the farmer if
need arose.

54. Stage 3: Achievement of the PDO through diagnosis, containment and treatment of HPAI in
humans; and reduced risk of zoonotic disease. This area focused on: (i) Enhanced Coordination and
Program Planning; (ii) Strengthening the National Public Health Surveillance System; and (iii)
Strengthening Health Care Response Capacity. In 2008, Kosovo did not have the ability to positively
identify H5N1 virus, nor were there arrangements in place for sending samples abroad (due to the status
of Kosovo at that time it was not covered by the WHO World Courier system). Furthermore, there was

55. Output – before restructuring Human health sector support; after restructuring, Strengthen
pandemic response capacity; NIPP revised; adequate stocks of consumables. Activities in this stage
included training human health workers, strengthening virological laboratory capacity, strengthening
disease surveillance capability, and procuring consumables including flu vaccine and antiviral drugs. The
National Influenza Pandemic Plan (NIPP) was published in September 2009.19 It was revised before
project restructuring in June 2009, and was subsequently continually revised by all involved parties. 20
International Air Transport Association (IATA) training was provided in May 2009 so that biohazard
samples could legally be transported by air. Arrangements were made with neighboring authorities to
confirm laboratory diagnosis. An isolation facility was established in the University Hospital, Pristina,
which was designated by the Ministry of Health for all human cases of influenza A of avian origin in
Kosovo. Since it opened in October 2010, the ICU had over 30 patients and over 200 patient-days
occupancy. The patients were >80 percent H1N1 cases: of these, four (<10 percent) died, due to
complications with other heart and lung conditions, which is a mortality rate within the expected range for
a unit dealing with seriously ill patients.

56. Outcome – before restructuring Human HPAI diagnosed, contained and treated appropriately;
after restructuring reduced risk of zoonotic disease [assumed outcome: revised human health outcomes
are not expressed clearly in the Restructuring Paper, Annex 4]. The contingency of human infection with
influenza virus of avian origin did not arise, but the capacity to diagnose, contain and treat it was
enhanced. Although neither humans nor birds were infected with A/H5N1, it may be assumed that risk of
zoonotic disease incidence was reduced as a result of enhanced disease surveillance and laboratory
diagnostic capacity as well as preparedness and by procurement and consumables that would be required
in the event of an outbreak. The new intensive care facilities and improved laboratory diagnostic capacity,
combined with better trained staff and a higher level of national vaccination coverage certainly reduced
risk of influenza and other disease. The new ICU enabled infectious patients to be properly segregated
and saved human life during the H1N1 pandemic.

Achievement of final (post-restructuring) PDO

57. The final PDO has two main elements: (i) minimize the threat of zoonoses; and (ii) prepare for and
control zoonotic disease emergencies in humans. The outcomes described above from the three stages all
contributed to reduction of the threat of zoonoses, particularly respiratory infection from influenza A
viruses, as well as to preparedness and control capacity. In particular, people’s awareness and behavior
had changed; the animal health services were better able to detect, confirm suspicion and respond to
animal disease outbreaks, including compensation for any culling program required; and the medical
profession had improved its preparedness and had better diagnostic and treatment capabilities. Therefore,
the PDO was achieved. Overall, achievement of project development objectives is rated satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

58. The financial analysis at appraisal was based on the direct financial impacts of an outbreak (both
contained and catastrophic) among poultry, which yielded an internal rate of return of 18 percent. 21
Given that Kosovo did not experience an outbreak of H5N1 HPAI before or during the project, the re-
calculation of the financial analysis is not deemed relevant as it is not counterfactual (see Annex 3 for
details). The poor quantitative and qualitative data collection during the project life aggravates the
possibilities to conduct a comprehensive quantitative analysis of project impacts. Therefore, this mission
carried out a qualitative analysis of the project impacts based on field site visits and personal
communications with relevant stakeholders, coupled with Bank documentation.

59. The project’s major long-term economic benefits stem from strengthened capacity in early response
management for both human and animal health for pandemic emergencies through the development of an
appropriate program of rapid response, detection and containment measures, including appropriate
implementation and monitoring arrangements. Since 2009, the Project Team and the Ministry of Health’s
response to pandemic and influenza-like diseases has been well focused, efficient and timely indicating
the cumulative benefits generated from the project investments in capacity building, knowhow,
infrastructure, equipment, and stockpile of vaccines and antiviral drugs. The better response was also
assisted by the ALERT- early warning system developed and installed country-wide through WHO
support. Another major benefit was the increased intensive care capacity through the rehabilitation of
Intensive Care Unit at Pristina Hospital, equipment provision and external training. 22

60. Increased diagnostic capacity in terms of both quality and reliability was achieved for AI and
other human and animal diseases, through the provision of new facilities, equipment, training and the
introduction of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology for
molecular diagnosis for the first time in Kosovo. In-country molecular diagnosis has decreased the
diagnostic time substantially, and improved test accuracy and expanded the scope of test activity and
improved methods for monitoring and diagnosing animal diseases.

61. The capacity of the veterinary service to control and eradicate zoonoses at the source of infection
increased through the establishment of the first Epidemiologist Unit under the Food and Veterinary
Agency (FVA), in the Department of Animal Health. The project invested heavily in national and
regional capacity building. It increased cooperation between Epidemiologists and Regional Veterinary
Inspectors to protect and prevent spreading of animal disease within the territory of the Republic of
Kosovo. It strengthened local planning and emergency response delivery capacities and, thus, developed
synergies between different interventions and donors activities.

62. It should also be noted that the Lead Project Coordinator and two Project Coordinators were from
existing government structures, IPH and FVA. This was a considerable cost saving when compared to a



21
   Technical Annex on a proposed Grant for the AI project, January 2007. An outbreak of HPAI among poultry
would have potentially far-reaching economic implications. A contained outbreak (such as those that have occurred
in neighboring countries) would oblige the culling of all poultry within a three kilometer radius of the suspected
outbreak, leading to loss of income for farmers, which would be paid for through government compensation funds.
Other economic implications include restrictions in internal and cross-border trade, and depressed demand for
poultry products. A catastrophic outbreak, in which a significant percentage of the poultry stock is destroyed at one
time, could potentially decimate the poultry industry, and would cause significant economic disruption as cross-
border trade comes to a halt. The spread of the disease among humans would have far more profound economic
impact: social distancing measures such as quarantine would be enforced, and potentially great loss of human life
might ensue.

project with Project Management Unit or Project Implementation Unit. Costs savings could be estimated
at US$144,000 (for three persons for 48 months per person paid US$1,000 per month, that is, 3 persons x
4 years x 12 months x US1,000 dollars). Although the project was extended twice, by 14 months,
implementation expenditures increased only by 4.6 percent, which is commendable.

63. The Project contributed to successful cross-sectoral work and multi-disciplinary effort (food agencies
under the animal and human health) and exemplary coordination among donors (WHO, UNICEF, EU,
OSCE, Austrian Government technical advisors). The donor collaboration particularly benefited the
outreach to minority groups, such as Roma, Egyptian and Ashkali (REA) and Serbs.

64. A measure of project efficiency was the proportion of total project costs (US$3,095,110) spent on
overhead and administrative activities (about 9 percent, or US$278,559).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory
65. The project followed, broadly, a template under GPAI PAD for Bank projects in a number of
countries to address the threat of HPAI. It proved to be relevant for Kosovo and was aligned with
relevant elements of the Kosovo Interim Strategy. Flexibility was shown in restructuring the project
when HPAI outbreaks did not occur. Thus, objectives and design maintained their relevance throughout
the project.

66. As concluded at the end of Section 3.2, achievement of the PDO was satisfactory. The elements of
the revised PDO were achieved, that is, the threat of zoonoses including HPAI was minimized, and
influenza epidemics and other disease emergencies in humans were well prepared for, and the means to
control them was established. Following restructuring, the changes enabled Kosovo to cope well with the
A/H1N1 “swine flu? pandemic later in the project.

67. The project was efficient, although standard, numerical economic analysis is not possible since the
PDO changed and pre-project economic analysis was based on assumed HPAI outbreaks. Therefore,
counterfactual comparisons could not be made between the internal rate of return (IRR) calculated at
appraisal and another calculated at the end. However, consideration of qualitative benefits leads to the
conclusion that the project’s investments were justified and that it will have long-term economic benefits.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
68. Women and children are key actors in the backyard poultry sector and, thus, key beneficiaries of the
project. The Public Awareness campaign specifically targeted school children, amongst others. Backyard
poultry is an important contributor to rural livelihoods for poorer people and the project protected these
livelihoods through increased capacity of the veterinary services for early detection and rapid response.
When sensitizing the public in awareness campaigns, efforts were taken to ensure avoidance of panic and
market shocks for poultry products, thus safeguarding this important source of income and nutrition.
Furthermore, the project managed to reach minority communities by preparing communication materials
in multiple languages and by maintaining strong partner arrangements with agencies (UNICEF, WHO)
having good access to ethnic minority areas and having working relations with telecommunications
services that reach them.




                                                    14
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
69. The project strengthened cooperation between the Food and Veterinary Agency (FVA) 23 and the
Institute of Public Health (IPH). Project Supervision Mission members encouraged the FVA’s
participation in the Commission for Health Promotion and Education, which was agreed upon as FVA
was represented in the Communication Working Group.24

70. The animal health sector was significantly strengthened, with enhanced capacity of the veterinary
epidemiology unit and a new, furnished and equipped laboratory building. The human health sector was
also strengthened, benefitting from project inputs into improved surveillance, diagnostic and treatment
facilities. The IPH was able to process samples from influenza cases and capacity was further enhanced
with gene sequencing technology in the last round of project procurement.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
71. Positive. Cooperation developed between this Bank-financed project and a similar Bank project in
Albania, and this brought cost savings, strengthened technical cooperation between Kosovo and Albania
and benefitted implementation by the Kosovo team, who learned from Albania’s earlier experience.
Specifically, (i) veterinary epidemiologists from the Albania National Veterinary Epidemiology Unit and
the Kosovo Veterinary Epidemiology Unit joined together for training held in Albania, (ii) Kosovo staff
participated in a simulation exercise that was held in Albania, (iii) Chief Veterinary Officers of Albania
and Kosovo forged stronger links, (iv) the Task Force Secretariat from Albania shared its experiences
with the Project Team from Kosovo and vice-versa.

72. Collaboration between the Bank and UN agencies cemented strong cooperation in Kosovo between
the Bank and WHO, UNICEF and FAO.

73. The Project did not fund a Project Management Unit, but worked with the different sectors (medical
and veterinary) to manage the project: the project was mainstreamed in the relevant Government
Institutions that is, FVA, IPH and Pristina University Hospital. There was a tough learning process for
national managers, but the policy ultimately encouraged ownership of the project, which should prove to
be a strong contributor to its sustainability.

74. Negative. Animal and human disease reporting under new project systems overburdened the FVA
and the IPH. The reporting should have been based on existing health reporting structures.

3.6. Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not Available

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

75. The risk that development outcomes will not be maintained varies across project components. For
Component 1, Public Awareness and Information Campaign, the risk is low: the IPH and FVA are
expected to continue to collaborate within the Commission for Health Promotion and Education.25 For
Component 2, Animal Health, the risk is significant as regular Bank Supervision Missions throughout the
project have described deficiencies, for example, with regard to the Epidemiology Unit’s management

and to timely processing of samples by the laboratory. The sustainability of key project outcomes in this
Component is affected by retention of key personnel who are capable of effectively operating the RT-
PCR technology.

76. For Component 3, Human Health, the risk is moderate: MoH had received support from the
Government of Luxembourg to develop its health care sector strategy and it is expected that donor
agencies will show interest in further support to project accomplishments. However, the sustainability of
Component 3 depends on Government policy priorities and budgeting. Overall, the IPH Director
remained optimistic for the future and pointed out that income is derived from selling laboratory services
(food and water testing).

77. Across all components, the institutional risk to development outcome is moderate for reasons
highlighted in the preceding paragraph; the economic and financial risk to development outcome is
moderate (for governance reasons, it is low in the health sector, but higher in the veterinary sector); and
the social risk to development outcome is low, as (i) strong public awareness programs have sensitized to
key issues and averted the public’s potential for panic around infectious, zoonotic diseases, particularly
influenza and (ii) reduction of the threat from diseases such as HPAI contributes to safeguarding the
socioeconomic status of poor poultry producers.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

78. The project was relevant: the Bank team brought knowledge of global good practice as defined in the
GPAI PAD and applied it according to the specific country scenario, that is, in the context of recent HPAI
outbreaks in neighboring Albania in a diffuse poultry sector with predominantly smallholder, backyard
management that was similar to Kosovo’s. Kosovo was considered high risk and the project was planned
quickly as an emergency project at a time of urgency in preparing for HPAI. Despite the urgency,
technical aspects were well planned and appropriate at the time of project formulation, and reflected the
need to scale-up Kosovo’s capacity to plan for, prevent, detect, and respond both to HPAI outbreak in
poultry and to human disease from influenza virus of avian origin. The project built on existing initiatives
in the sector, particularly UN agencies’ AI projects in Kosovo.

79. The role of women and children in poultry management in Kosovo was clearly identified at appraisal,
and incorporated into the design of behavior change and communication activities, ensuring that children
were targeted. Environmental aspects were adequately considered at entry, with regard to civil works for
laboratories and hospitals, handling of hazardous laboratory waste and disposal of culled poultry. The
particular needs in Kosovo associated with divisions on ethnic lines and minority enclaves were
recognized and described at project design.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

80. The Bank fielded six supervision missions between April 2007 and Spring 2011 as well as the Mid-
Term Review mission in February 2009. It fielded three Interim Project Support missions (one in 2008
and two in 2010). The Supervision missions all included health and veterinary specialists as well a
communication/operations specialist, with the support of procurement and FM specialists and, throughout




                                                    16
the project, missions effectively identified and proposed practical resolutions to threats to development
outcomes achievement.

81. Interim Project Support missions were organized in response to specific problems in implementation,
such as issues with the Animal Health component’s progress or delays in disbursement or procurement.
At each mission, agreed actions were clearly stated in a mission aide-memoire. The mission aide-
memoires were comprehensive, well prepared and clearly articulated agreed actions for each project
component and, thus, helped ensure that the PDO was achieved. The Implementation Status Reports,
however, did not incorporate or report on all the new indicators in the (revised) Restructuring Paper
Results Framework.

82. Continuity in guidance to the project team was provided with the same TTL, the Animal Health
Specialist and ECSSD Projects Officer throughout, and two Health Specialists (changed in 2010).
Specific areas of Bank supervision included: (i) securing local working arrangements with WHO and
UNICEF; (ii) encouraging the authorities to pay the veterinary epidemiology team; (iii) dealing with
delays in procurement; (iv) identifying issues with financial management; and (iv) articulating the
rationale for project extension and agreeing extension. The Bank was responsive to the Government’s
needs and priorities, for example, in restructuring to respond to the A/H1N1 pandemic, in showing
flexibility when there was no outbreak of HPAI, and in utilizing funds allocated originally for
compensation in other areas of need.

83. Bank support missions were locally organized, reducing the costs in comparison to bringing experts
from, for example, Washington DC. There were further cost savings in terms of not paying for a PMU,
although, this policy may have resulted in some implementation delays as busy Government staff
absorbed the new activities into their workload and learned the Bank procedures. However, this also was
successful in providing a strong sense of ownership.

84. The Bank met all safeguard requirements in a timely manner and provided assistance and training for
the procurement and FM staff throughout the project. Internal problems, such as staff and leadership
changes prevented prompt resolution of procurement and FM shortcomings in the Project Team.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
85. Rating: Satisfactory. The rating reflects ‘S’ rating for Ensuring Quality at Entry and ‘S’ rating for
Quality of Supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.

86. During the life of the project, Kosovo progressed from being administered by the UN to declaring its
independence in February 2008. There were also internal reorganizations as the authorities transitioned
from the Provisional Institutions for Self Government: for example, the Kosovo Veterinary and Food
Agency was changed to the Food and Veterinary Agency; and personnel assigned to the project in some
cases had changed responsibilities. Despite major flux, the Government was closely engaged with the
project throughout, from identification and preparation through implementation. The Government agreed
KVFA as the project implementing agency responsible for FM and procurement for the animal and
human health components implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and
the Ministry of Health. There was a sense of urgency at the time of project preparation, in the face of
recent HPAI outbreaks in poultry in the region, and the Government avoided delay in due process.

87. Government made an allocation in its budget for emergency compensation in case of animal culling
as part of disease stamping-out: at the end of the project US$395,300 was available for compensation.


                                                   17
Thus, at project restructuring, the Government could endorse redirection of project funds that were
previously made available for poultry culling compensation to other activities.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

88. As discussed in Section 2.2, problems arose early in project implementation, resulting in a moderately
unsatisfactory rating prior to the MTR during 2009 (and again in 2010). With respect to the Implementing
Agencies’ fiduciary performance, although FM, procurement contracts and project audits were carried out
in compliance with the Bank’s guidelines, at the MTR, Component 4, Project Implementation and M&E,
was rated unsatisfactory after two years of implementation. M&E had not been conducted properly and
the M&E expert left the project after two years of implementation. During the same time, procurement
was reported as a particularly weak aspect, being rated highly unsatisfactory. At MTR, financial
management was moderately satisfactory: there were shortcomings with record-keeping and problems
associated with staff changes. By the end of the project, Procurement was rated satisfactory and FM risk
was assessed as moderately satisfactory. 26 The final rating is MS as, in the last nine months of the project,
the PT accumulated knowhow, reached the “bio- rhythm? and materialized in reaching the project
objectives.

89. Procurement delays resulted in some training activities not being implemented, for example, the crisis
management module. Although most were accomplished, this was with severe delays: (i) intra-hospital
infection control and bacterial resistance; (ii) zoonotic diseases management; and (iii) crisis
communication management.

90. Successive Project Supervision Missions commented on poor management of the veterinary
epidemiology team and also delay in carrying out laboratory tests on samples to confirm avian influenza.
The missions also considered that the aspirations for the veterinary laboratory were unrealistic for Kosovo,
which did not require so large a laboratory with facilities at Biosecurity Level 3 or higher: reaching
agreement on laboratory specifications also caused delay.27 Late in the project, the Project Team (PT)
was not functioning efficiently: there had been only one meeting of the PT between August 2009 and
June 2010 and agreed actions had not been acted upon.28 However, later, due to almost biweekly audio
and video conference meetings with the Bank team, the situation improved. The project managed to
disburse fully and close three months prior to the planned closing date.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91. The rating is based on the Satisfactory rating for Government Performance and the Moderately
Satisfactory rating for the performance of the Implementing Agencies.

6. Lessons Learned

92. A global template can enable rapid, good project design. The GPAI PAD was in place and was
used as the basis for the preparation of this project. The existence of a sound, global plan ensures that an

effective project can be formulated relatively rapidly at a time of emergency due to an emerging
infectious disease in uncertain circumstances.

93. Including Terms of Reference for specific tasks and Technical Specifications up front in the
Operational Manual (OM) is critical so as not to stall implementation of any emergency project. As
stated in Section 2.1, all emergency equipment such as protective gear and disinfectants for border points
were included in the project’s OM, which helped to hasten procurement and implementation.

94. Projects formulated for a specific disease can prove to have too narrow a PDO and, therefore,
require restructuring. The project was formulated specifically to address HPAI, but some of its outputs,
such as, enhanced veterinary epidemiology unit and intensive care unit, had from the outset wider
applications to other diseases. In projects primarily concerning a specific disease, the PDO should be
broadened to include other diseases of concern that may emerge or become problematic during
implementation.

95. Decentralized task management for supervision missions can be effective and save costs.
Utilization of country specialists based in neighboring countries for project supervision in Kosovo proved
successful and represented cost savings when compared with the alternative of bringing experts from
another continent.

96. Close coordination with specialized UN agencies can enhance the quality of technical assistance
and produce cost savings. WHO, UNICEF and FAO gave technical assurance for project
implementation by working together with the Bank and with implementing agencies. The agencies funded
their own expatriate specialists at project formulation and supervision. This lesson is applicable to a wide
range of Bank projects, depending on their particular technical areas.

97. UN agencies can extend Bank project outreach. WHO and UNICEF extended outreach in Kosovo
by assisting the project to access communities in ethnic enclaves. The UN agencies had working relations
with ethnic minority community-based organizations, broadcasters and decentralized health centers and
used these contacts to benefit project implementation.

98. Video conferencing can be an effective way to provide regular implementation advice between
bi-annual Supervision Missions. This is a relatively inexpensive way of maintaining a stream of advice
and support.

As national resources were available for compensation purposes, (Kosovo Assembly Law No. 2004/21 on
Veterinary and MAFRD Administrative Instruction No. 2005/24 on Fighting AI) the compensation fund allocation
(US$567,300 equivalent) was redirected to finance the adjusted Project scope, especially the activities for Human
and Animal Health components and activities that exceed cost estimations (Restructuring Paper, 18-Dec-2009). In
December 2010, the Eligible Emergency Imports (SDR 120,000) was reallocated to the various project components.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Project description (from the Restructuring Paper of December 18, 2009): The following changes were
made to the project at restructuring: (i) the scope of planned interventions was expanded to include
diseases other than HPAI, such as influenza A/H1N1, and the PDO was revised accordingly; (ii)
development of a National Pandemic Plan was supported, to establish mechanisms to manage a
pandemic; (iii) compensation funds were cancelled; and (iv) project activities were revised to support the
revised PDO. Revised project activities by component were:
             Component 1, Public Awareness and Information.
              Address knowledge gaps on A/H1N1, influenza-like diseases and other zoonoses.
             Component 2, Animal Health.
              Waste water treatment of Animal Health Laboratory (AH Lab); and equipment, furniture
              and consumables for the AH Lab;
             Component 3, Human Health.
              Support pandemic response, including the declared A/H1N1 level 6 pandemic alert by
              scaling up hospital preparedness and health sector response capacity; respond to Recipient
              requests for laboratory reagents, disinfectants and personal protective equipment (PPE);
              revise the 2008 National Pandemic Preparedness Plan; and raise preparedness in the
              regions for diagnosis, referral and management of outbreaks and Pandemic.
             Training and Technical Assistance.

Annex 2a. Description of Indicators and Achievements/Outputs by Component

Component 1: Public Awareness and Information

Achievements under this component are rated satisfactory.

The key outcome indicator specified under this component was:
   - Targeted population (poultry producers, veterinary and health personnel) and general population
       are aware of the HPAI threat and practice measures to protect themselves and others from HPAI
       (baseline survey to be conducted at beginning of project),
   revised at restructuring to:
   - Targeted population (poultry producers, veterinary and health personnel) and general population
       are aware of the HPAI, A/H1N1 and other zoonoses threat and practice measures to protect
       themselves and others.

Achievements/outputs against indicator
The project produced a range of awareness-raising and communication aids including leaflets, posters,
videos/DVDs, stickers, and farmgate notices. The project also supported broadcasts of messages on radio
and TV. For A/H1N1 general information leaflets were produced in Albanian (160,000 copies) and
Serbian (20,000 copies). With UNICEF, a children’s poster drawing competition was organized in
Project Year (PY) 1, 2008.

KAP surveys were carried out in 2008 and 2010 and provided evidence of behavior change for self
protection and of improved awareness of avian influenza when comparing data collected in the two
surveys. The surveys reported: (i) 50 percent (80 percent in 2008) of the general population have
changed the manner they handle poultry or poultry products; (ii) 22 percent (16 percent in 2008) wash
their hands after touching poultry or poultry products; (iii) 31 percent (22 percent 2008) cook poultry
products well; (iv) 33 percent (32 percent 2008) avoid contact with dead poultry and wild birds; (v) 10
percent (21 percent 2008) do not consume any poultry products; (vi) 96 percent of the general
population have a high level of awareness about AI; (vii) 45 percent (33 percent in 2008) reported that


                                                   21
information have been heard mostly from television broadcasts; (viii) 9 percent (1 percent in 2008) of
general population have received information through brochures, posters, and leaflets; (ix) 88 percent
(72 percent, in 2008) was aware that AI is caused by a virus; and (x) 24 percent of general population
was aware that symptoms of AI included fever, sweating and coughing. It is a positive development, see
point (v) above that the percentage of the population not consuming poultry products has reduced,
because the market shock caused by consumer concern is not justified where there is proper cooking and
safe handling.

The surveys demonstrated awareness and behavior change primarily in the general population rather than
in the targeted groups as specified in the outcome indicators. The target population of both KAP surveys
was for (a) the “Quantitative Survey?, 8,800 from general population, 100 healthcare staff, and 100
students and for (b) the “Qualitative Survey?, 20 teachers, 20 farmers, 20 distributors/traders and 10
journalists. 29 Therefore, veterinary personnel were not assessed although named among the targeted
population for awareness and information; however, 100 health personnel and 20 farmers were included.
Regarding healthcare workers, the KAP survey concluded that “the data shows that healthcare staff has
not significantly improved their fundamental knowledge of avian influenza?. Regarding farmers, the
survey reports (i) that this group had improved biosecurity measures on their premises (e.g. restricting
access) and (ii) farmers generally were skeptical that AI would be epidemic in Kosovo.

Component 2: Animal Health

Achievements under this component are rated satisfactory.

The Animal Health Component’s three subcomponents are: (a) Enhance HPAI Prevention and
Preparedness Capability, (b) Strengthen Disease Control Capacities and (c) Strengthen HPAI Control
Programs and Outbreak Containment Programs.

The indicators specified under this component are:
       i.   Kosovo Veterinary Laboratory identifies the presence of HPAI revised to Kosovo Veterinary
            laboratory identifies the presence of the disease.
      ii.   The PISG cull birds at the infection point and establish a protection zone, with participation
            of local governments and the population, revised to, Government culls infected or at-risk
            animals, compensates promptly, and takes effective control and safeguard measures.
     iii.   The PISG compensate farmers for culled birds in a timely manner, revised to, Government
            operates efficient epidemio-surveillance in the field.

Indicator (i). This revised indicator is somewhat vague and confusing: it refers to laboratory
identification of “presence of the disease? without specifying which disease. 30 As the PDO was
broadened to encompass diseases other than HPAI, perhaps there is a typographical error in the
Restructuring Paper, and it should read “. . . presence of disease?. On the other hand, if it refers
specifically to HPAI, the laboratory did not identify this disease in the laboratory, although the project
provided the means (i.e. building, furniture, equipment, reagents and training) for the Veterinary
Laboratory to do so: HPAI was almost certainly not present in the country and, therefore, could not have
been identified.

Indicator (ii). Birds were not culled in Kosovo because there was no HPAI outbreak in the life of the
project. However, compensation procedures were established.

Indicator (iii). Disease surveillance improved with more regular reporting from the field.

Achievements/outputs
The animal health laboratory was completed in September 2010 and was furnished. Equipment was
procured and installed, including RT-PCR for the diagnosis of HPAI and other animal diseases, and
reagents were provided. Training was provided in March 2011.

After the project budget component intended for compensation was redirected to other uses at
restructuring, financial resources were made available under existing law. A rapidly accessible
compensation fund US$395,300 from the State budget remained at the end of the project.31 The means to
compensate farmers within 10 days of disease containment activities was established. A mobile
incinerator, disinfection equipment and associated materials were procured and distributed.

The Epidemiology Unit was restored to its full complement of eight staff and the staff participated in
training (two weeks in Albania, twice; 5-day study tour to Turkey). By the end of the project field
epidemiologists were trained to investigate disease (HPAI Basic Epidemiology), including sample
collection and submission for confirmation of diagnosis by the KVFA Laboratory. In PY 2, Simulation
Exercises were carried out (field version in Albania and desk-top exercise in Kosovo), which tested the
readiness of the systems for disease reporting and control.

Component 3: Human Health

Achievements under this component are rated satisfactory.

The indicators specified under this component are:
       i.   Infection is diagnosed and contained [if there is an HPAI outbreak], revised to, Adequate
            preventive measures in place.
      ii.   Patients receive appropriate treatment for HPAI infection [if there is an HPAI outbreak],
            remained unchanged at restructuring.

Indicator (i). Preventive measures were established through development of the Pandemic Preparedness
Plan.

Indicator (ii). Appropriate treatment facilities, including a modern Intensive Care Unit (ICU), were
developed.

Achievements/outputs
Surveillance capability was enhanced with strong cooperation with WHO through installing the ALERT
disease surveillance system country-wide. The Bank/WHO organized training for health staff as part of
pandemic preparedness. Surveillance guidelines and procedures were developed and adopted in 2009.
The virology laboratory was upgraded and equipped in 2010 and confirmation of results by international
reference laboratory was over 95 percent. 8,000 doses of seasonal flu vaccine were procured in PY2 and
vaccination coverage was 100 percent IPH staff, 50 percent hospital staff. The published NIPP was not
reprinted as a new version after restructuring, but was revised, according to Supervision Mission Aide-
Memoires.

An ICU with up-to-date equipment, including negative/positive pressure ventilation and isolation rooms,
was completed in September 2010 in the Pristina Infectious Diseases Hospital. 25,000 doses of antiviral
medicine were procured and were ready for treatment in case of need.

Component 4: Project Implementation and Monitoring and Evaluation

Achievements under this component are rated satisfactory.

The planned activities specified in the Project Technical Annex under this component are under two
headings: Provision of Support to the Project Team and Monitoring and Evaluation.

Achievements/outputs
Achievements/outputs included the following:
        AI Operational Manual was completed,
        Preparation of annual work programs were produced,
        Preparation of progress reports. Annual reports were produced,
        Satisfactory completion of annual external audits,
        Updated procurement plan completed to date,
        Financial Report produced.

Project Coordinators were responsible for coordinating activities, workplans and project reports as well as
for implementing decisions of the AI Working Group. Early stages of project implementation suffered
due to strain caused by the additional project-associated workload on top of Component Coordinators’
pre-existing responsibilities. Project management weaknesses were resolved with frequent meetings
organized and led by the Lead Project Coordinator, and biweekly Video Conferences and Audio meeting
with the Bank team. Additionally, the project coordinators received some training to facilitate their
coordinating and management role in the project.

The team produced quarterly and annual reports, financial reports and also result & framework
monitoring for every year of the project; however, the latter experienced problems of quality and delays
in delivery. The Bank addressed the issue by providing additional training for the M&E expert in Vienna
and in Tirana. The M&E was further aggravated when the expert left in January 2010. PT contracted an
M&E specialist, to cover project reporting.

    According to the Borrower’s report, some of the figures decreased from the 2008 to the 2010 survey. The reasons
  are as follows:
       1. Survey in 2008 took place after a communication information campaign conducted by the AI Project.
       2. In 2008 survey, avian influenza had actually occurred (in the region, though not in Kosovo). In 2010,
            swine flu was more evident.
       3. The general population’s perception of risk was low level.
       4. Responses from the general population were subjective.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

INTRODUCTION

The PDO was to minimize the threat posed to humans by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)
infection and other zoonoses and to prepare for, control, and respond to influenza pandemics and other
infectious disease emergencies in humans. The project focused on: communication and awareness
programs concerning both human and animal health; development of an appropriate program of rapid
response; constructing an AH laboratory and rehabilitating and upgrading IPH laboratory facilities; intra-
hospital operational and safety procedures; and training/capacity building of key staff in the health and
veterinary systems.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

The poor quantitative and qualitative data collection during the project life aggravates the possibilities to
conduct a comprehensive quantitative analysis of project impacts. Therefore, the ICR mission carried out
a qualitative analysis of the project impacts based on field site visits and personal communications with
relevant stakeholders, coupled with Bank documentation. The appraisal financial analysis was based on
the direct financial impacts of an outbreak (both contained and catastrophic) among poultry, which
yielded an internal rate of return of 18 percent. 33 Given that Kosovo did not experience outbreak of
H5N1 HPAI before and during the project, the re-calculation of the financial analysis was not deemed
                                      34
relevant as it is not counterfactual.

PROJECT BENEFITS

The project’s major long-term economic benefits stem from strengthened capacity in early response
management for both human and animal health for pandemic emergencies through the development of an
appropriate program of rapid response, detection and containment measures, including appropriate
implementation and monitoring arrangements. Since 2009, the Project Team and the Ministry of Health
response to pandemic and influenza like diseases has been well focused, efficient and timely indicating
the cumulative benefits generated from the project investments in capacity building, knowhow,
infrastructure, equipment, and vaccines stockpile. The better response was also assisted by the ALERT-
early warning system developed and installed country wide through WHO support. Another major benefit
was the increased intensive care capacity through the rehabilitation of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at
Pristina Hospital, equipment provision and external training. 35

The project contributed to increased diagnostic capacity in human and animal health diagnosis not only
for AI, but also in terms of improving both quality and reliability through the provision of new facility,

   Technical Annex on a proposed Grant for the AI project, January 2007, Appendix 8. An outbreak of HPAI among
poultry would have potentially far-reaching economic implications. A contained outbreak (such as those that have
occurred in neighboring countries) would oblige the culling of all poultry within a three kilometer radius of the
suspected outbreak, leading to loss of income for farmers which would be paid for through government
compensation funds. Other economic implications include restrictions in internal and cross-border trade, and
depressed demand for poultry products. A catastrophic outbreak, in which a significant percentage of the poultry
stock is destroyed at one time, could potentially decimate the poultry industry, and would cause significant
economic disruption as cross-border trade comes to a halt.

were true.

equipment, trainings and the introduction for the first time in Kosovo of RT-PCR technique, for
molecular diagnosis. The latter has allowed molecular diagnosis, decreasing substantially the diagnostic
time and expanded the scope of test activity as well as improved methods of monitoring and diagnoses of
the animal diseases.
The increased capacity of the veterinary service in control, and eradicate zoonoses at the source of
infection through the establishment of the first Epidemiologist Unit under the Food and Veterinary
Agency, in the Department of Animal Health.

The project invested heavily in national and regional capacity building. It increased cooperation between
Epidemiologists and Regional Veterinary Inspectors to protect and prevent spreading of the animal
disease within the territory of the Republic of Kosovo. Strengthening local planning and emergency
response delivery capacities included developing the synergies between different interventions and donors
activities.

The Project was implemented through existing governmental institutions, namely the FVA, the IPH, and
the Pristina University Hospital, in line with the PISG plan for implementation of HPAI preparedness and
response measures. While mainstreaming of the project in the relevant Government institutions slowed
down the initial project implementation, it resulted in a strong ownership of all the actors involved, and
commitment to efficiency in completing project activities and the use of the resources allocated. The
Project sustainability is ensured through the increased demand for the new efficient services (new testing
methods in IPH and AH laboratories), enhanced staff skills through trainings, and the incorporation of
Operation & Maintenance for laboratory diagnostic and ICU into the state budget allocation.

The Project contributed to successful cross sectoral work and multi-disciplinary effort (food agencies
under the animal and human health) and exemplary coordination among donors (WHO, UNICEF, EU,
German Twinning Project, OSCE, Austrian Government). The donor collaboration particularly benefited
the outreach of minority groups including Roma, Turkish community and Serbs.

Component 1: Public Awareness and Information
This component contributed to raising awareness and increased knowledge of HPAI and Swine Flu
through an effective public awareness and information campaign, which was critical for promoting the
widespread adoption of measures to prevent the spread of the disease, by reducing the risk of transmission
among animals, from animals to humans and from humans to humans; and preventing the spread of
human influenza. 36

Health-related public awareness and communication activities in Kosovo targeted individuals and groups
representing various sectors expected to be front line communicators in case of outbreaks of HPAI, Swine
Flu or any other influenza like contagious disease that has epidemic - pandemic capacity. The information
and communication campaign targeted also school teachers to maximize effectiveness, not only when
children were identified as key beneficiaries, but also because children can influence their families and
others. This was extremely successful in raising awareness among the Kosovo population.

The project supported the training for 550 people from different segments of population and enabled the
(i) establishment of an information and communication network and (ii) social mobilization for the
prevention of AH5N1 and AH1N1. Target population of the trainings was multi-sectoral and have
involved health workers, teachers, and representatives of the Red Cross Volunteers. Similarly, training
programs to health care workers and teachers have assisted in reinforcing the preventive work.

The project conducted two KAP surveys; the first one to set a baseline data used for project monitoring
and evaluation, and monitors the impact of the information campaign on the population.37 The second
survey checked the effectiveness of the message delivery and was used to refine the objectives identified
as prevention and hygiene and care for the minority groups.

During the information campaign, two issues arose: industry damage and depressed demand of poultry
products due to conflicting messages delivered by the unprepared media staff. The project team reacted
quickly and took measures to rectify the economic damage by training media on how to deliver
information on avian influenza and swine flu and its outbreak, to avoid unnecessary economic and
financial losses in the country.

The existing multi disciplinary commission for the communication/education campaign under the
Department for Health Promotion of National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) 38 was already active in
implementing some information campaigns in collaboration with UNICEF, and assisted the
Communication Working Group (CWG) including representatives of the Governmental Institutions, and
International organizations such as WHO, UNICEF. The better coordination and complementarity in
responding to threats between the various agencies 39 (in terms of both funds and human resources)
resulted in cost savings from the project.

UNICEF, which was the lead technical agency in public awareness and communication, was critical in
reaching and distributing informative material in minority areas. Expenditure on this was budgeted at
US$25,200 in project planning but around US$100,000 was actually spent. The actual cost of this
component was US$0.263 million, or 83.3 percent of the amount allocated at the project design.

Component 2: Animal Health
As the country never faced an AI outbreak, in accordance with the Government the project was
restructured to align it with the broader scope of the Global Program for AI (GPAI), including not only
HPAI but a broader range of zoonoses. Thus, the Compensation fund was redirected for future country
need. 40 In December 2010, the Eligible Emergency Imports were reallocated to the various project
components too.

The implementation of this component has been erratic with several problems related to lack of
management skills, poor inter-agency communication cooperation and coordination that might jeopardize
the project output sustainability. 41 However, it can be assumed that this project component has
contributed partially to reduce the probability of outbreaks of HPAI and other diseases through (i)
enhanced of HPAI prevention and preparedness capability (ii) strengthened laboratory diagnostic
capacity; (iii) strengthened disease control capacities, and (iv) ensured resources and procedures for
compensation.

Enhanced HPAI Prevention and Preparedness Capability. The project strengthened Kosovo’s policy
and regulatory environment for veterinary service and inspection, and also supported HPAI prevention
and control planning. The support was carried through (i) improving regulations and protocols in
accordance with OIE standards and guidelines, especially in chapters and articles of the law dealing with
disease control, surveillance, and eradication, (ii) improved and updated “Kosovo Operational Plan for
Control and Eradication of Avian Influenza?, (iii) two table top simulation exercises conducted in Albania
where all regional epidemiologist from Kosovo attended: and (iv) participation of Veterinary Services
officials and project staff in regional and international information exchange and dissemination of
expertise on avian influenza.

Strengthened laboratory diagnostic capacity. A new Kosovo Veterinary Laboratory was constructed,
furnished and provided with new equipment (RT-PCR amongst others) and staff capacity. Given the short
timeframe in which staff received equipment and training, coupled by the TA from Twinning, the staff
has not yet mastered the RT-PCR and other testing techniques. A point worth mentioning though is the
beneficial acquisition in the new Animal Health laboratory of a young expert trained in the USA, who
benefited from a range of training in-country and abroad about routine performance of RT-PCR for HPAI
and other 4 animal diseases that would ensure the sustainability and reliability of the laboratory diagnostic
capacity. 42 The implementation of RT-PCR for HPAI and other diseases would allow in the long run
molecular diagnosis in real time reducing diagnostic time and expanded the scope of test activity.
Similarly, the diversified training of veterinary staff have improved methods of monitoring, and diagnoses
of the animal diseases. This subcomponent has also contributed to strengthening of territory-wide
diagnostic capacities and bio-safety protocols at the Kosovo Veterinary Laboratory.

Strengthened Disease Control Capacities. The surveillance and diagnostic capacities of the animal
health, veterinary public health and animal welfare improved through disease surveillance and control
programs in monitoring of HPAI and other diseases which are of high risk to animal and public health for
the country.43 The Veterinary Epidemiological Unit (VEU), first in the country, was established by the
project for leading the emergency response in HPAI outbreaks, and then transferred under the animal
department within FVA (January 2010) ensuring continuity and sustainability after the project life. The
additional eight resource people of the unit were well trained (both in-country and abroad)44 and have
been extensively involved with veterinarians in (i) inspections in commercial farms of food business
operators (milk processing plants, slaughterhouses, processing plants of food of animal origin, markets,
licensed veterinary practices); (ii) cattle disease monitoring, (iii) lake monitoring; (iv) rapid test field as
routine screening, and (v) vaccination programme against brucellosis.

Disease control capabilities were not tested for HPAI as there was no outbreak during the project;
however, two simulation exercises for avian influenza have been conducted: one field simulation in
November 2007 and one table-top simulation exercise in Albania (January 2008). It may be assumed that
strengthening the animal health sector (laboratory and surveillance) has contributed to minimizing the

   See Borrower ICR. FVA has been monitoring world and neighboring countries with regard to AI and took some
measures to prohibit import for live poultry and poultry products from countries in the region where outbreaks
occurred. Every year it has been implemented control poultry for fast Rapid test for AI in the field About 200
samples, were tested in laboratory in Pristina with produced negative results for AI.

   See Borrower ICR, Training to broaden capacity building for Animal Health Component. From 28 June to 02 July
2010 eight epidemiologists from Kosovo attended the training in Albania: Analytical epidemiology on animal
disease including Avian influenza, conducted by International Veterinary Expert. Abroad training took place in
Turkey in December 2010, on animal disease, prevention, control and eradication. The project financially supported
the participation in training in Turkey for ten epidemiologists and inspectors.

threat of HPAI and other zoonoses, and the prevention and/or control of zoonoses such as swine flu and
brucellosis.

Ensured resources and procedures for compensation. In case of outbreak, based on the existing Law
(Kosovo Assembly Law No. 2004/21 on Veterinary and MAFRD Administrative Instruction No. 2005/24
on Fighting AI), adequate compensation procedures and financial resources are in place for prompt
compensation of farmers, for culled animals, at market value. The MoF is able to provide timely
compensation within 10 days. As national resources were available for compensation purposes, the
compensation fund allocation (US$567,300 equivalent) was redirected to finance the adjusted Project
scope. The actual cost of this component was US$1.25 million, or 84.9 percent of the amount allocated at
the project design.

Component 3: Human health
This component supported a national program for strengthening public health surveillance and disease
control systems through the development of territory-wide strategic plans and administrative procedures
aligned with the International Health Regulations. The component activities have had a great impact on
the improvement of early response to influenza pandemic through the development of the National
Integrated Preparedness Plan for control and response to outbreak and pandemic. 45 In addition, the
Protocol for AI was developed as strategy for the country, and the Pandemic Plan was updated according
to OIE Standards, through support of the project and WHO. Coordination between institution was
enhanced through the Action Plan for the prevention and management of Influenza Pandemic A (H1N1),
WHO in collaboration with IPH.

Strengthened core capabilities and functions of the health system can be attributed mostly to major project
investments: (i) establishing an influenza surveillance system and strengthening the capacity of the IPH
and regional epidemiological investigation and response teams; (ii) rehabilitating the Influenza
Laboratory and supporting with equipments, kits and reagents and PPE, (iii) the training of virology
laboratory staff, and (iv) rehabilitation of intensive care unit.

The Project supported life-threatening diseases though the provision of RT-PCR. The IPH laboratory on
Influenza has tested more than one thousand samples with Real Time PCR machine. The IPH lab enrolled
for the first time this year (2011) into External Quality Assurance Program on Influenza, organized by the
WHO in “Hong Kong SAR, China?, in which the results were 100 percent in concordance with expected
results (95 percent concordance at the first time), proving the high quality performance. Total number of
tests executed by the lab for recent pandemic wave is 845, out of which 135 are confirmed positive on A
(H1N1).

The Project supported capacities for laboratory diagnostics of influenza cases in humans through support
provided to the National Influenza Centre, at the Department of Microbiology, National Institute of Public
Health of Kosovo. The following benefits have been recorded: time savings in detection, change
mentality for diagnostic, improvement of communication flow and increased income for the Institute for
additional testing services. The project also provided automated single – capillary sequencing machine
which will expand research capacity of the laboratory services towards the research, especially the ones
related with possible mutations of the influenza viruses. As an additional benefit, the same technique
would be used for other microbial pathogens (Hemorrhagic Fever) which are presenting important public
health threat for the country. 46


45
   Plan was prepared in accordance with WHO recommendations. It Included Infection control, diagnostic and
clinical management, use of new machine and equipment, and new hospital triage and protocols.

The Project supported rehabilitation of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Infectious Diseases Hospital at
Pristina. The newly ICU was upgraded according to the international standards with modern equipment
with 24/7 monitoring capacity; which allows the personnel to observe all vital functions of the patients
(e.g. pulse, pressure, etc). As of ICR mission (February 2011), there were about 30 patients who received
adequate treatment with mortality rate of less than 10 percent. Severe cases with various nosologies and
complications have been treated in the ICU, also for other infectious diseases including acute encephalitis,
severe forms of meningitis, H1N1. Utilization rate of the ICU is being modest and it will be important to
make efficient use of it.

Generally, in health projects, the project benefits stream is calculated in terms of (i) resource cost
savings which is a reduction in out-of-pocket expenses for health care as a result of reforms in health
financing; and/or (ii) productivity gains as a result of less time lost to illness. Productivity gains are also
realized when less time is spent for the care of sick family members.

Calculating the above economic benefits is complicated by the lack of reliable data on hospitalization
costs, average daily wage and the magnitude of the impact that they would have. Thus, the mission could
not make guess estimate of the economic cost savings for the Kosovo economy.

The better preparedness of the Kosovo health authorities to control and prevent the spread of the
communicable diseases among humans combined with the improvements in the health system and in the
health care workers’ performance contributed to avert great economic impacts, which would have
stemmed from hospitalizations, social distancing measures such as quarantine, and potentially great loss
of human life attributed to HPAI and other infectious disease other than HPAI.

This qualitative analysis is only indicative of the overall project benefits. However, it is reasonable to
estimate that economic damage control of the poultry sector and reducing human exposure to the HPAI
and other diseases can be said to justify such project. The actual cost of this component was US$1.314
million, or 135.7 percent of the amount allocated at the project design.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Executive Summary of the Borrower’s Implementation Completion and Results report is shown
below, verbatim, with minor grammatical editing.

Executive Summary

This is the Borrower’s Completion Report for the Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic
Preparedness and Response Project, in Kosovo, and covers the period from project start up, April 2007 to
project completion date, March 31, 2011.

Kosovo meet the financing criteria for the GPAI, and has demonstrated its commitment and has an
appropriate program of rapid response, detection and containment measures, including appropriate
implementation and monitoring arrangements that the international agencies and donor community can
support.

Government of Kosovo with support of the international donor, focused on mounting a rapid response to
improve surveillance, detection and containment measures.

The Avian Influenza Project in Kosovo, during its implementation, has had very good progress. Have
been realized all project planned activities and have been used all the project resources. Project team has
been totally mobilized and was focused to improve surveillance, detection and containment measures, in
line with international standards.

With the project support the country has improved the capacities to prevent, identify, contain and
eradicate HPAI A/H1N1 and influenza like disease outbreaks. Kosovo also has proved that can manage,
in a pandemic situation, based in its own resources and capacities. Project had disbursed US$2,894,801
or 97% until March 31, 2011. This is achieved also due to the readiness and efficient support from the
Ministry of Finance and Economy that have acted immediately after every project request. The human
and animal health teams worked together under one health agenda and this collaboration is going to
continue in the future. The project implementation was supported by WHO and UNICEF, and also from
other donors WHO, UNICEF, EU, OSCE, Austrian Gov, FAO, etc. For the first time in Kosovo are using
the RT-PCR techniques, for doing the molecular diagnosis, in human and animal health diagnosis.

Achievements by components are as follows:

Public Awareness and Information
Through organization of Outbreak Communication Trainings at all levels have been increased knowledge
and communication skills of individuals and groups representing variety of sectors that are expected to be
front line communicators in case of outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza or any other
influenza like contagious disease that has epidemic - pandemic capacity.

Was assessed through implementation of two KAP Surveys changing behavior of the population that will
be manifested in decreased risk of spreading of the infection, among animals, from animals to humans
and from humans to humans, and increasing the participation of the population regarding to adequate
answer by the risk of avian flu. Was increased the public awareness, through information from TV spots,
leaflets, trainings with schools and other information available. People are well informed of the disease,
and how to prevent from the spread of the disease and the disease A/ H1N1 treatment when it happened.

Have been supported the communication activities to develop an effective public awareness and
information dissemination campaign for keeping the population informed in the prevention of the spread



                                                    39
of the disease, reducing the risk between animal to animal and animal to human transmission, and
preventing the spread of human influenza.

Information and communication about Avian Flu and Swine Flu, helped in the behavior change of the
population, which reflected in prevention of this disease in Kosovo.

Mass Media is very important for keeping population informed. Also distribution of leaflets and booklets
about Avian Influenza and Swine Flu helped the population of Kosovo to prevent the spread of the
disease.

Have been trained 550 people from different groups of population, establishing a network for information,
communication and social mobilization for prevention of AH5N1 and AH1N1.

Regarding the Public Awareness and Information component sustainability, there is need to highlight
that Communication working group (CWG) is still in the MoH at the IPH, led by the same person, Prof.
Drita Salihu. Although the project activities have been closed on March 31 2011, the CWG is still
working covering other diseases. For sure that they are better trained based on the experience and training
received under the AI Project.

Animal health
Have been established and supported from the Project Veterinary Epidemiological Unit, under KFVA.
The six epidemiologists have been supported by the AI Project up to December 31, 2009. From January
01, 2010, they have been transferred to the Food and Veterinary Agency, in the Department of Animal
Health. This is one of the purposes of the project, to mainstream trained staff to the government
institutions.

All epidemiologists are working closely with Regional Veterinary Inspectors to protect and prevent
spreading of the animal disease within the territory of the Republic of Kosovo, based on the Veterinary
Law in Force 21/2004 and Administrative Instruction for prevention, control and eradication of Animal
disease and control of food business operators (milk processing plants, slaughterhouses, processing plants
of food of animal origin, markets, licensed veterinary practices, etc.

Epidemiologists also, have undertaken monitoring of the vaccination against Rabies, Brucellosis,
Classical Swine Fever and New Castle Disease. The total number of vaccinated animals (sheep’s and
goats) against brucellosis was 175.000 and 17 municipalities has been monitored. Also vaccination
against Classical Swine Fever took place where 55.000 pigs were vaccinated in 9 municipalities and all
action was under surveillance of epidemiologists from Animal Health Department.

The monitoring of lakes in Kosovo was another activity of epidemiologists which resulted with 532
samples sampled in backyard farms in near lakes Badovc, Livoq, Batllave and Radoniq which were tested
in field through Rapid test.

The AI Project supports the construction of Animal Health Laboratory, first floor, with an area of 300 m2.
The laboratory is coo financed also by Kosovo Government, the second floor of the building was GoK
investment. The Laboratory was inaugurated October 10, 2010. The laboratory is fully functional. The
laboratory has the capacity to investigate samples for Avian Influenza, Newcastle Disease Virus and also
Classical Swine Fever, and additional samples for diagnosis for the above mentioned diseases for which
the staff was trained several times.

The Animal Health laboratory diagnostic capacity was improved substantially by assigning a new expert
trained in USA, and also supported with technical assistance from the Twinning Project, for routine
performance of RT-PCR for HPAI and other animal diseases. Actually she is attending training in


                                                    40
Germany for laboratory methods dealing with serology and PCR techniques for AIV, NDV, Rabies,
CSFV, Bluetongue etc.

Laboratory also is supported with two packages for kits and reagents, two packages for laboratory
equipments, and one package for laboratory furniture. The new laboratory is equipped also with some
equipment for preserving the samples and reagents. Also is equipped with an autoclave in order to destroy
the waste material after the analyses. The laboratory staff is trained for using RT-PCR technique.

Through this laboratory have been improved the methods of monitoring and diagnoses of the animal
diseases. Also the laboratory capacity is increased compared with former laboratory. It is improved also,
through using of RT-PCR technique, the quality of analyses and fiduciary in their results.

Laboratory staff is participated in comparison tests in FLI Hanover Institute and Institute of Animal
Health in Israel.

With regard to the Animal Health Component sustainability of the project we may say the following:

      i)    The epidemiologist team is working and paid by the FVA agency. All of them are included in
            the state budget (wage bill) for 2011 and in the planned budget of 2012. The VFA will do the
            utmost to further train them.

      ii)   Further support of the Animal Health Component laboratories and investments made in the
            framework of the AI Project, we would like to confirm that the FVA, in Kosovo will always
            be supported by the FVA state budget in adequate and appropriate amounts and also through
            different donor programs. The budget allocated to the FVA for the programs of animal health
            and Food and Veterinary Laboratory for 2010 was 1.2 mil. Euro. The budget for 2011 is 1.2
            million Euros. For the mid-term project-budget forecast 2012-2014 we are planning yearly
            average 1.4 million Euros and with budget for 2010 the salary of epidemiologists, the needs
            for reagents, kits and different type of trainings will be covered.

Human Health
The Kosovo Avian Influenza Project has provided substantial support in establishment of capacities for
laboratory diagnostics of influenza cases in humans, through support provided to the National Influenza
Centre, at the Department of Microbiology, National Institute of Public Health of Kosovo. By the project
funds was rehabilitated, and equipped the Microbiology Laboratory at IPH. Also the staff was trained.
Through this lab is possible to do molecular diagnoses, in order to identify pandemic virus.

Kosovo faced an expansion of Influenza A (H1N1) in the end of 2009 and beginning of 2010. The
Laboratory staff in this situation, where there were a big number of suspected cases, managed to act
properly. For the first quarter 2010 total number of samples taken was 104, which were processed in
Microbiology Laboratory. Amongst this number of samples 3 resulted as positive in A (H1N1). IPH, all
samples sent to the reference Laboratory through IATA Procedures using the special box for transport of
the samples. The results from the reference laboratory were the same.

Microbiology Laboratory at IPH was supplied during 2010 with a number of packages as: (i) the power
unit of the RT PCR ABI 7500 machine; (ii) Protective clothing for Hospital and Primary care health; (iii)
IPH consumables and reagents; (iv) Equipment for microbiological identification and Antimicrobial
Sensitivity Testing (AST); (v) Equipment for molecular diagnostics; and (vi) Some minor works were
conducted at the NIC laboratories.




                                                   41
The National Influenza Center –National Institute of Public Health Kosovo has been involved for the first
time in WHO External Quality Assessment Program (EQAP) for the detection of Influenza Virus Type A
by PCR on June 2010. As part of the Panel 8 of this program, 10 samples have been sent from WHO
Influenza EQAP in “Hong Kong SAR, China?, to the NIC-NIPH. Simulated RNA samples were supposed
to be tested for influenza A/(H1), A/(H3), A/(H1pdm), A/(H5) and influenza B viruses and results
reported within one month. The staff of NIC-Kosovo has tested and reported samples within mentioned
period of time and results of all 10 samples were notified as accurate by the WHO Influenza EQAP team.

Intensive Care Unit at Pristina Hospital was restructured and in October 2010 was inaugurated. This is a
very modern unit and is equipped according to the international standards. In this unit receive treatment
highly infectious diseases. It is composed by three separate rooms, out of which one is with negative
pressure (2 beds), one with positive pressure (2 beds) and one with normal pressure (4 beds). The pressure
machine is connected online with the Center in Italy (Sagi Cophy), which supervise the situation.
Infectious Disease Hospital where Intensive Care Unit is located was also co-financed by GoK that
rehabilitated entire third floor, including elevator and also co-financed by Government of Austria, which
equipped with 40 beds and other furniture.

For the first time in Kosovo are using the RT-PCR technique, for doing molecular diagnosis, in human
and animal health diagnosis.

With regard to the sustainability Human Health Component of the Project specifically the following
is happening and is foreseen.

        i)   further support and in the same direction of increase is also going the support for the Institute
             of Public Health labs for 2010 was 102000 euro, the plans for 2011 is 100000 Euro, which
             will cover needs for kits and reagents.

        ii) further support is also going the support for the Intensive Care Units at the Pristina Hospital.
            The state budget funds for 2010 were 48000 Euro and for 2011 are 45000 Euro and for 2012
            have been planned now to be X 45000 Euro.

Comment:

The Project “Kosovo Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response? closed
on June 30 2011, has provided a fundamental support in establishing the capacity of Kosovo institutions
to respond adequately, for animal and human health components, in case of eventual outbreak of Avian
Flu in Kosovo as well as cases of AH1N1 influenza throughout the years 2009/2011.

Although the start of the project was not promising enough, as was mentioned also in the report, the
professionals from the responsible institutions in Kosovo (Ministry of Finance, Agency of Food and
Veterinary of Kosovo, the National Institute of Public Health, the Clinic of Infectious Diseases in the
University Clinical Center of Kosovo, etc.) have achieved to meet all the objectives of the project through
dedicated work and close coordination. The fact that 99.96% of the funds have been used from the
implementing partners in the needed destinations provides an additional indicator of this achievement.
The Bank Implementation completion report of the project realistically presents all the phases and
implemented activities and we do not have any additional comments for this report, which was prepared
with a significant contribution of representatives of Kosovo institutions.

We need to mention that the need for direct financial support, for staff and expendable material, is still
present because of the budgetary constraints that we still face.

We express sincere gratitude to the World Bank for the grant that was given, as well as, for the
continuous support throughout the project implementation, with the hope that we will have successfully
implemented projects like this one in the future.

                 Comments received from Ms. Ardita Tahirukaj/on behalf of
                      Mr. Skënder Syla, Head of WHO in Pristina

       Thank you very much for sharing with WHO office the ICR report on Avian Influenza Control
and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project. The ICR report reflects very well the
achievements and very good collaboration between WB, UN agencies and local institutions.

   I would like to take this opportunity and highlight some points as follows:

      Very good collaboration among WB, UN agencies and local institutions during planning,
       implementation and supervision of the project led to better coordination, synergies and not
       overlapping with each other’s activities which then led to a better utilization of resources and
       very good results.
      Project supported the improvement of surveillance, detection and containment measures in line
       with the international standards. Reconstruction and upgrading of the Virology Laboratory at the
       National Institute of Public Health at BSL2 was a great achievement. The National Institute of
       Public Health (NIPH) has been supplied with the RT-PCR equipment and the appropriate training
       allowing diagnosis in real time and responding so well to the client's needs. WHO ensured
       continuous supply of consumables and advanced training for the staff including trainings abroad
       in virology reference laboratories. Also, WHO ensured that the newly established Virology
       Laboratory at the NIPH is part of the WHO external Quality Assessment Programme (EQUAP)
       for the Detection of Influenza Virus Type A by PCR. The results of the Quality Assessment
       showed that all samples tested and diagnosed by Virology Lab in NIPH were 100% accurate.
      Reconstruction of the Intensive Care Unit in the Infectious Diseases Clinic of the Kosovo
       University Clinical Centre was a great achievement of the project as a joint effort of the GoK,
       WB, OECD Austrian government and continuous WHO’s support with training.
      Another positive aspect of the project was that it has been focused on prevention through
       information and awareness component. Public information and awareness campaign lead by MoH
       and with the UNICEF/WHO technical guidance, proved to be an efficient tool to prevent the
       disease. The WHO was part of the project team and continued to keep momentum and work on
       public awareness matter as a preventive measure for diseases prevention. WHO implemented
       training for health workers on prevention and case management of the Pandemic Influenza A
       H1N1 in whole Kosovo including North Mitrovica.

    However, a shortcoming in our cooperation with WB was that we could not enter into a formal
agreement due to WB requirements for contractual agreement which proved to be very cumbersome and
unworkable. Despite this WHO agreed to take over activities in minority areas and ensure their financing
from its own resources.

     To finalize our comments to ICR report we would like to reemphasize that cooperation between the
World Bank team and WHO has been excellent as described in the ICR report and it will be our pleasure
to join forces in continuity with the World Bank in health sector.


Sincerely,
Ardita Tahirukaj / On behalf of Dr Skender Syla

          COMMENTS FROM THE KOSOVO FOOD AND VETERINARY AGENCY
                                  FOR THE
         AVIAN INFLUENZA CONTROL AND HUMAN PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS
                           AND RESPONSE PROJECT



General Comments

The World Bank Implementation Completion Report (ICR) of the Avian Influenza Project, represents a
very good summary of the project achievement in meeting the project development objectives. We fully
agree with its findings, the ICR is so well written and can be open to the public.

The ICR presents well the joint work of the Bank with the Government of Republic of Kosovo and the
donor community, starting with the appraisal and all project phases of implementation until completion.
The Project restructuring was a good part of the dialogue and partnership between the WB and
Government of Republic of Kosovo. It has been done on time and took into consideration the country
needs of that time and of the future needs. The Project has been a good example of different stakeholders
dealing under emergency conditions and responding to the country need in a quick and efficient manner.

The project had a very good experience in coordination and collaboration between different stakeholders
and donors. It was the first time that both staff from Food and Veterinary Agency, and Ministry of Health,
respectively National Institute of Public Health came to collaborate and work so closely and good
together. We think that this team spirit has positively influenced in achieving most of the project
objectives and it is very likely to continue in the future. The project is a very good example of covering
the country needs in the minority areas as well. In this aspect the Bank coordination with the donor
community especially WHO, UNICEF, FAO has been the best example.

We also want to thank the entire team of WB experts for taking the time to share their expertise and
knowledge to local expert staff. It was through these times that local staff was able to learn and grow the
most in developing their technical skills over project duration and receiving the needed trainings in the
right moment. The WB experts were most responsive to our needs and always gave us the best to
achieve the project goals and respect the donor’s rules.

We do not have any objection for making public the Implementation Completion Report (ICR). In fact
the ICR has summarized so well the project achievements and the lessons learned are so valid. The AI
Project closed in June 30, 2011, the rating is realistic and the outcome is marked as satisfactory, showing
the increased capacity of Kosovo Government institutions to successfully implement Bank financed
project. We would wish to bring to your attention the needs to continue with new projects which should
be focused more on our continuous needs in the veterinary and food area under the one health agenda in
our country and the region.

Inputs for ICR Report


Throughout the whole project duration, UNICEF Kosovo office continued to actively support the World
Bank financed project “Avian Influenza and Human pandemic preparedness and response?.

While UNICEF and the WB successfully cooperate in various areas, UNICEF’s support mainly focused
on the area of communication, by providing expertise as a member of the ‘Avian Influenza Committee’
and supporting implementation of specific awareness raising activities, for example for minority groups in
northern Mitrovica.
Moreover, UNICEF supported facilitating mission visits to assess the progress and effectiveness of the
project. During these missions, coordination of various partners could be enhanced and important project
components strengthened with regard to administrative and procurement procedures.

The continuous project cooperation resulted in close collaboration of the World Bank and UN agencies
with relevant Government institutions.

Based on discussions and documents, the project supported institutions to increase capacities to respond
to pandemic influenza and considered development of results framework for monitoring and evaluation
component of the project.

The ICR is a good summary of the AI Project achievements and describes the synergy among the donor
community in Kosovo. The ICR rightly mention that through the AI Project it has been strengthened the
cooperation of the Kosovo Government among the WB, UNICEF, WHO, FAO and other donors and we
will for sure continue to further strengthen our cooperation in the future.
