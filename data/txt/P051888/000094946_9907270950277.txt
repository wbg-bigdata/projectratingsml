Executive Summarv
Shaanxi Province plans to use the Worid Bank Loan of one hundred million U.S dollars to
carr, out "Guanzhong Irrigation Improvement Project ".This envineerina project mainly consists of
water diversion junction engineering structures. irrigation canals. pumping station. drainage. water
resources \\orks. medium-iow vieid farmiand and infrastructure faciiities. etc. In such 9 irrigation
districts as 3aojixia. Jinghuiqu. Jiaokou. Taoqupo. Shitouhe. Fengjiashan Yangmaowan. Luohuiau

-he ziassification of engineering environment impact evaluation belongs to Class B. The
\'Ar:c_ 3Ban  rnission has also coniirmed that lhe ciassific3tion or environment impact evaiuation of
:iis !troec Deiongs to Class B. The World Bank missions (the first mission ,preparatory mission and
itoDramsai mission) have orfered valuable suggestions and opinions for the compilation of evaluation
port embodied these suggestions and opinions.
7hrough the overall invesri2arion into the evaluation areas, the monitoring data or inforrnation
concerning water qualities. soils and farm crops for many years have been collected. This evaluation
takes the environment problems of two layers into consideration. One is that the engineering
concrete implementation of each project mav bring about environment impact; and the other is likely
to have environment impact with regional behaviors. As to the first group of problems. we can use



:he tabular torms of environment imoact and mana-ement zo describe them one bv one. As for the
second ciass of prooiems. based on tne characteristics of the improvement pro;ect. the evaluations
aTe mainly made of inundated river xnater environment. soil alkalization. and wvater-logina.
a-roecological intluence and the effect of inundated reservoir area upon the immigrants.ithere is the
special action plan for the immigrant settlement).ln considering dam and adding the gate to the canal
head in Baoiixia which may have the environment impactn a special separate report on environmental
impact is compiied as an annex attachea to the renort.
After tne implementation of GCIP. the yeari, increased adjustment and storage of vwater can be
^ 4.5million mn.The newly-increased available irrizated area can be 49.33kha:the improved area is
!SOkha:the controlled %\ater-:ozging area is 260.4k.ha:enlarged irrication area is 19.33 kha. Grain
ie!ds can be expected to increase bv -4.36 million tons :and there w-ill be a vearly total increase n
v-ie!d b 5 5O.s in coinoarison wvith that in the years of 991-1996 prior o the improvement.
Tlhe  n!e%alUalon analysis ndicates that water aualirv in water resources is ;n aureement with
'\ater 2uiaiit\   anotements 3et in GB  4084-9  << Rainfed A-ricuiture>>. An increase :n water

Jinhuiau irriuation district is a reservoir aravirx -low irrization district. \Vater diversion junction worKs :s
iocated in Zhangiiashan.Jinvan2g counrty. ith an irrigation area of S9.36 kha. to irrigate 3 counties andi
administrative districts inciuding Sanvuan. jinvang, Gaoiin. lintong and Yanliang. etc. this irrigation district
ne-an to be constructed in !93. but in 199f. addino gate to the canal head was completed The canal intake
consists of a reintorced concrete dam and intake zate. Design water diversion flow is 46m"'s. The main and
aterai canals total 3,78 km. At present. the available efficienc- of irrigation water in this irrigation district s
o).3t. There still niave been some probiems even in operation for over 60 years in this irrioation district.
Low-yield 1farmiands of 26.0 kha in this irrigation district can not be irrigated completelk so ihat
ii is necessary to reforn the mnedium-iwo  ! ieid farmiancs.
The main and lateral canais have become ageing and damaged serious!y, and the, neei o -e

4.3 Jiaokou irrigation District
4.3.1 Project description
Jiaokou irrigation district by pumping the Wei river water is the largest irrigation district to irrigate
farmlands bv pumping water. and was compieted in 1970. and irrigates an area of 79.82 kha. There are 31
pumping stations with 123 sets of pumping equipment installed. and its installed capacitv is 19687 kw.
The canal head is located in Xilouzi village where the Wei river and the Shichuan river join together.
The intake gates have 13 holes. Design flow is 32m3/s. The maximum   pumping capacitv is 41m3/s. The
main and lateral canals total 434.93km. The irrigation district covers six counties (municipalities) such as
Linton-, Pucheng, Fuping, Weinan. Dali and Yanliang, etc. Irrigation water use efficiencv is 0.61. It has been
in operation tfor more than 30 years and the present existing problems are in the following:
The Wei river controiling engineering and canal head intake gates have been out of repairing
for vears so that they need to be reinforced.
'''    \1achinerv and electric Lquipment in 31 pumping stations have become ageing with a 'ow
efficiency and unsafe operation so that thev are urgent to be renewed.
The medium-low \ieid tarmiand of ':3.33 kha need to be improved. and at the same time. 3.333
'sha of farmlands can be eniarged under irrigation.
1)    Drainage svstem  is unsmooth. The landform  in Jiakou irrigation district is so ilat that he
mineralization of groundwater is high. and that there is a serious salinization-alkalization threat. The
drainage controlled area is 66 kha. of which 12 kha need to be imDroved. And at the same time. the
I km of power transmission line needs to be improved.
T=he imoortant items of improvement project in jiaokou irrigation district include the followings:
Canal junction &: reservoir engineering: controlling the river course at canai head. renew-al of
mnachiner. and eiectric equipment in canal head pumping stations.
Canal engineering: controlling dangerous sections of generai main canal. removing  man
reintorcingi dang-erous sections in the south and east main canals.
2)     Pumping station engineering: 25 pu.ping stations in Tianshi, Xinwang,Xiaozhai need to be
improv ed.
4 )    Drainage engineering: 4 drainage svstems need to be improved.
Medium-low vield farmland improvement project: the improvement and corollary of 3.  kha.
and the enlarg-ement of 33.3 kha under irrigation.
Communication  facilities  improvement. extension  of water-saving  and  energy-saving
techniques. improvement of dangerous houses of scientific research intergrated facilities. etc.
'Totalng 5 groups of engineering covering 39 items.
4.3. Environment impact of improvement engineering
rhe environment factors and problems included in each engineering of 39 engineering items in Jiaokou
irrigation district are shown in Table 4-5 - Environment protection measures and environment monitoring
control.
4.3.3 Environment management and monitoring plan
Environment professional management in Jiaokou irrigation district is the same as that in Baojixia
irrigation district.
There are 2 monitoring points in construction period, 5 points for water quality monitoring points, 3
locations for observing and measuring wells,l soil sampling point and I agroecological point during its
operation. The concrete layout of these monitoring network points are shown in Table 4-6 and Fig.4-2.

4.4- Taoqupo irrigation district
4.4.1 Project description
Taoqupo irrigation is a reservoir gravitv tlow irrigation district. Canai head at Taoqupo reservoir is
located in the Mvazhei mountain gor_e belt in the northwest of Yaoxian county. he reservoir consists of a 6 i -m-
hiiih homeoenerous eartn dam. spiilway and water releasing Tunnel. Total reservoir storage capacity is 57.20
mnillion in . tne \earlv regulating water capacirv is 8 l.'0 million m . it irricates 2 1 .o2 isha in Yaoxian counrx.
and ShichLuan riVer vallev iand in Fupirnz counrt. Design tlows* for water reieasing tunnel is 'I.Omr's. The main
and lateral eanais in the irrigation district total '30 'Km. Irrigation water use efficiencv is 0.47. The main
existing problems ;n Taooupo reservoir and its irrigation district are in the followina:
;!    .\ater resources -c Ciency: it is planned that a gate is added to the weir crest of spillk%ay to
raise \\ater levei of 4.Om .o that the effective reservoir capacity can increase bv 10 million mi.
'Filinu uo reservoir Xakaiiae: reservoir dam ftoundation is located in the Tielong mountain till the
slant ea-e af TaoQupoponsisting ot the thick lime rocks in Ordovician system. The reservoir was
eompie:ea in 1960 and be(7an to store water since after the reservoir has hiad a serious leakage.
Accordirgi\.n filling uo o o.eaKai.e in reservoir area should be carried out.
l-' ixo.evement of neoiuin-low  %ieid farmiand: In the irrigation district. there are 8 Kha
:'arnmiars .nicn --an not be fully irmriated iue to tle impertection of engineering facilities so that
_;oD % tids are low: and the farmiands need to be improved: and meanwhile. 3.35 kha can ne
*niarued under irriaation.
*I 4    Improvement or existing engineering: The high side slope on the left bank, of the rcservoir
mil\xav is more than 90 in high. Since the reservoir was put into operation. the side sioDe 'has
JDneared to be unstable so that slooe-cuttinu treatment should be carried out. In addition. three w-ater
diversion iunction works in the irrigation district must be strengthened and improved.
he !nain tiemes oft m[provement engineering in Taoqupo irrigation disirict are as follows:
naihead lunction &  reservoir tncrineering: the filling up of reservoir leakage and Ats
oanso! u.cation:
-  ial enioineering: enlargement en-ineering of Gao main canal:
.urrping station engineering: Improvement of two pumping stations at Yaihuou and           gia
. .Vater resources engineering: adding the gate to the weir crest of spillwav:
-       \le \ium-ioxv farmland improvement engineering: the improvement and corollarv of SkJia. ind
*ne -mar-einent oD  33 kha under irrigation:
1`n-atructure  faciiities and  new  technology  extension. improvement of communicaton
a:t. es. construction of 6.5 km of flood prevention road.
-.- nig, o groups of engineering covering 13 items:
'4.4: Env ironment impact of improvement en'ineernQ:
The environment f'actors and problems included in each engineering of 13 engineering items in Taoqupo
.;r,pro\e: ent rroiect are shown in table are shown in General Table 4-7 -environment impact and
nnane 3 emnt.
4.4.3  Environment management and monitoring plan
Environment professional management in Taoqupo irrigation district is the same as that in Baijixia
irriLation district.
There are I construction environment monitoring point at the damsite in Taoqupo village during
construction. 4 sections for water quality monitoring,2 wells for observation and measurement,2 soil
sampling points and 3 agroecological monitoring points during its operation. The layout of these monitoring
points are shown in Table 4-8 and Fig.4-2.

4.5.1 Project description
Shitouhe irrigation district is located in the south bank of the Wei river in the west of Guanzhong,
irrizating '11.67 kha of farmlands in Qishan and Mixian conties and also is responsible for water suppiv to
.ian citv. The reservoir is located on the Shitouhe river - a tributary of the Wei river in Mixian countv.
The reservoir junction structures are located in Xaiyuguan village and consist of a sand gravel dam of 114 m
high with a clay core tuanel. spillway, water transporting-tunnel and flood discharge tunnel, Total reservoir
capacitv is 125 million m'. Yearly regulating water is 270   million m3. The reservoir was completed in 1981.
design capacitv for water transporting tunnel is 70.0m3/s
The main and lateral canals in the irrigation district are 112.6 km. The reservoir has been put into

'Anter  Ise e.'.iciencv in the canal svstem  is 0.b6. For more than 40 years operation. there has been no
:ati_ilolln in storage facilities ith a yearly water shortage of 140 million in'. On the one hand. long-ierm
rkrtuion has caused the rising of groundwater level in some part of the region.
Design drainage control area is 50.7 kha. Although 202.4 km  drainage ditches are dug to drain the
water. some parn of area is still not controlled. For this reason, the following engineering structures are to be
increased and improved.
(1)      It. is planned to add the gate to the existing overflow dam so as to make canal head form   a
storage capacitv of 41.4 million m; to regulate water of more than 66 million m;.
,'2)     Newly-dug and enlarged main ditches of 41.7 km  so as to improve the drainage area of 7.33
70



kha.
2 3)   To line canal of 1007 km. improve low-vield farmiand of 18 kha. and at the same time. -xpand
irrigation area of 4.0 kha.
The important items of improvement engineering in Luohuiqu irrigation district are as follows:
I1)    Canal engineering: enlargement of Luoxi main canal, controlling of flow muddy section of east
main canal and improvement of 4 key eneineerina structures such as Luoxi siphon.No.S tunnel. Quli
aqueduct. etc.
'2)    Drainage engineering: enlargement of No. I main drainage ditch in luodong irrigation district.
I)    Water resources engineering: adding -ate to Luohui canal head.
-4)    Mledium-low yield farmiand improvement engineering: the improvement and corollary of 18.00
kha. and the eniargement of 4.00 kha under irrigation.
Infrastructure facilities and  new  technology extension. improvement of communication
facilities.

cultivated farmland in Chencheng and Beishui counties. of which 0.1 3kha is irrigated by pumpinc water. The
irrigation district can get its water from the Shibuchuan river -- a tributarv of the luohe river. The damsite is
located at 500 m east of Panquhe village oi Shitou Township in Luochuan countv. The reservoir junction
consists of a homegenerous earth dam. water  releasing tunnel,    flood discharge tunnei and bottom
tunnel for tlood discharme. Total reservoir storage capacitv is 62.2 million m3. The effective storage capacity
is 32.3 million m3. The irrigation district was completed in 1975. The design tlow is l1.5m'/s. Water use
etficiencv in the canal is 0.55. The items needed to be reconstructed and renewed in the improvement project
include the followings:
,1)    Canal head junction & reservoir engineering, removing the dam danger and consolidating dam
at canal head;
'2)     Canal engineering: the improvement of main canal:
' b )  Pumping station engineering: to improve luchang pumping station:
.A1!    .lMedium-low vield farmland improvement engineering: the improvement of 10.00 kha and the
enlargement of 4.00 kha under irrigation: and
0)     Infrastructure facilities and new  technology extension. improvement of communication
faciiities and scientific research integrated facilities; construction of flood prevention road and
improvement of dangerous houses.
Totaling 5 groups of engineering covering 13 items.

5.1.2 Effectof vater pollution and control upon irrigation resources
.12.1 Investigation water pollution resources in the Wei river (shaanxi Section)
It can be seen from evaluation in section 3 that the important pollutants in the Wei River are
CODcr . petroleum  substances. volattite phenols. non-ion ammonium. etc. Accordingly, it is verv
necessarv to make clear the pollution resources because the Wei river is the major water resources tor
Baojixia and Jiaokou irrigation districts.
Since there are no criteria and no requirements for non-ion ammouniium or ammonium nitrogen in
agro-irrigation water. which are benefit but not harmful in agro-irrigation water. Wasted water. CODcr
and petroleum substances have  become the important subjects in pollution investigation.
Since the Wei river runs from the west to the east. the counties (municipalities) draining the
Dollutants into the Wei river directl) are Baoii municipalit,v Baoji county, Qishan, Mixian. Wuronc,
Xinping. Xian. Weinan. Huaxian and Huavin counties (municipalities),Through investigations. the
pollutants drained by these counties (municipalities) along the Wei river are listed in Tabie 5-3. Water
bod%Y functionai zonification of the Wei river and the Luo river and the distribution of pollution
resources are indicated in Fig.5-2.
It can be seen from the table that as viewed from the pollutant emission such as wasted water.
CODcr. and petroleum substances in Shaanxi section of the Wei river. Xian is the biggest. Xianyang is
the second largest: and Baoji and Weinan are the third largest in the prefecture level citv.

5 1.2.2 Effect of controlling over water pollution upon irrigation water diversion
The irrigation districts diverting water from the Wei river are mainlv Baoiixia and Jiaokou irrigation
wistricts. Baojixia irrigation district is divided into the irrigation district on the plateau and that beiou the
piateau. The irripgation district on the plateau can obtain its water from the Wei river a: Linii village to
construct dam i3 kim a%kav from Baoji citv. Water resources in Shaanxi section is basically not polluted except
that the coming water from the upstream in Gansu province mav suffer from pollution resources. As a result.
.vater quality at present is much better. The irrigation district below the plateau can obtain its water from the
Wei river at Weijiabu villa_e to build low dam on the north bank I km awav from M9ixian count\,v whose wvater
ei alitv is much affected bv industrial wasted water and living sewage wvater drained bv Baoii city, Baoji
countv town and Qishan countv. Accordingiy, the incoming amount of sewage water into the Wei river from
the above counties and   citv must be strictly controlled. At present the `95th" research project -- " the
comprehensive utilization of sewage in Baoii Citv" is to studv this problem> With the implementation of the
planninQ of controlling over water pollution. water aualitv in this section will take turns for the better
obviouslv. Jiaokliou irriaation district is iocated in the lower reaches of the Wei river. Water quaiitv in this
section is maini affecteo bv sewage water drained bv Xian. Xianvang apart from the pollutants from the
upstream ol the WVei river. Accordingi%, an amount o IWasted water, sewage water and pollutants drained into
the river must be strictiv controlled.
In 1996.Shaanxi provincial people's government issued the notice of <<The implementation of [some
problems concerning environmental protection of the State Council] (No.65 Shaanxi: Government Issued
!)96)>> and cleariv defined that by the vear -- 2000. the emission of the poilutants bv all the industriai
potlution resources shouid be strictly controlled within the standards set bv the country and the province. Total
aimoLint ot The ma)or poilutant within the standard set bv the emission in eacri preeScLure. lliWILyaliL> ai
eou11\ Siloulid be controlled within the targets set bv the province. The W\ei River the Yan river and other
rivers nave reacned the standards set in << the classification of surface water region in Shaanxi Province>>
rior to SeDt. 30 in 1996. All the paper making factories with the capacitv of annual production of below 5000
tons. :he tenner\ with an annual capacitv of processing hides below 30000 pieces. the dvestuff factorv with an
annuai zapacity of producing dvestuff below 3000 tons. and the enterprises adopting the backward pattems
sLICh as 'it tvpes". 'tanks" and "open tvpe oven" carrv out coking and oil refining should be banned bv the
.:ouinI  aovernment's  orders.  Also. the small enterprises .which carrv out As refining, Hg refining, Pb and
Zn refining. oii refining and 2old selection and insecticides or agrochemicals. bleaching and dveing, electric
Jiatin- and producing asbestos goods and radiation products should be closed down or stopped in production
', he XoUnt\ government's orders or laws.
:n Sept.  99S. ;he PeoDle's Congress of Shaanxi Province examined. approved of and issued c<
Reujations for Controlling Over Pollution along tne Wei River Vallev>> . which has obviouslv set that thie
7eoie s governments at various levels should implement the objective responsibilitv mana,gement l)
coniroilingi over water pollution in the piaces under their jurisdictions. Also, the "regulations' have apparentlv
-peciied the star.dards for the reservoirs, and water diversion engineering in the Wei river shall adoDt the

,no  '.c.nan .lunic:Daiities sihouid set LID wasted water or sewage disposal or treatment piants concentratedlv
as  on as nos.zible. It can De precicted trom this that with the implementation of the above regulations and the
intensificanon ot etforts to carrv out laws, the discharge of water pollutants will be etTectiveil controlled. and
:he '-%orsemnntg tendency of wvater qualities can also be strictly prevented. As a result, there will be no further
etfect to produce uponI water qualities in irrigation water resources can be expected to be improved to a certain

5.2 Analysis of Soil Salinization and Water-logging
I.2.1 Identirication of the Secondarv Salinization and Water-logging Zones
The main reason to cause soil salinization and alkalization is shallow buried groundwater level and high
mineralization of groundwater. The reason to cause soil,water-logging is that groundwater level is over soil

It can be seen from the above tables thar there are oniv two irrisarion districts. i.e. Luohuiqu and Jiaokou
irrigation districts have had their groundwater mineralization be over 3000mgiL. and that the   area with
-rounoxsater !evel burieu iess than -m totais 54.1  k ha. accounting for 9.5%°o of total area. mainly spreading
over such 5 irri-ation districts as Baoiixia. Jinhuiou.Yangmaowuan and Luohuiqu irrigation districts.
Based on the dynamic variations in groundwater and alkalinization zones mav distribute in Jiaokou and
Luohuiqu irrigation districts, while the potential water-logging zones will spread over such three irrigation
districts as Baojixia. Jinhuiqu and Luohuiqu.
The alkaiinization and salinization area in .iaokou irngation district is 11.34 kha. and its groundwater
buried deep and the distriburion of'salinization and ailkalinizarion area are shoNxn in Fig 5-3. The alkalized and
,aiinized area in Luohuiou irrigation district is 7.33 kha: and its uroundwater buried deep and the distribution
of'salinized and alkaiinized lands are shown in Fig.5 - 4.
2.> . Impact of secondarm  saline-alkali soil
Based on the important items of GIIP. it is necessarv to analyze the impact of the implementation ot' this
roiect upon the potential saline-alkali zones:
Irrigation:
After the implementation of GIIP. there is no increase in water diversion in Jiaokou irrigation district, but
;ere is an enlargerhent of 3.33 kha of irrivation area as well as the improvement and coroilarv of Z;3.33 kha oI'
irrn-ation whereov to reduce per unit area irrigation water requirement. Therefore. irrigation can not cause the
:;linm o0f arolUnwater level in Jiaokou irrigation district. Luohuiqu irrigation district will increase 29 million
:nm  of suriace wvater and emiarge the irrigation area of 4.0 kha and improve efficiencv will take 0.6. And there
.A li he  0  or' irrigation water to be converted into groundwater. As a result. groundwater level in both the
:-auei srrlation zone and the improved irrhiation zone will rise by 0.02 annuallv: and the buried depth of
.=!DUnd\\ ater Ie\ei in the non-improvement zone in Luohuiqu irrigation district.
'' '   ODrainage:
W'hen investigating the evolution process of secondary saline-alkali soil in Jiaokou and Luohuiou
rr:gation districts have found that the degree of secondarv saline-alkali soil is closely related to the extent ot
-erre.tion or arainage facilities in the irrigation district. Groundwater level in Jiaokou irri_ation district rose
:. U.:: - )i Sim on a veariv average as of 1963 when it started to irrigate farmland until 1070. In the vears of
- '96. eniarued irrigation area caused an increase in water diversion so that groundwater level
:on1iued lo rise xith 0.33 m on the yeariv average.  As a result. there has appeared to have 0.87 kha of
frln-N\ater ;±rea: and the area with groundwater level within 2 meters has been expanded to 365.' kha. Since
an; AOs. a1 iairge-scale drainage engineering wvas carried out, the groundwater levei rising has been oasically
:ontroiled beiow the critical water depth of I.S-2.0 m.  In the eariv 1990s.  groundwater level rose again in
:ne irrigation district due to the increase in rainfall so that drainage engineering continued to be constructed
and the improvement of drainage engineering was completed. Accordingly, groundwater level dropped
apparently. The investigation into groundwater level in Nov, 1997 over the irrigation district indicated that the
-uried depth of groundwater level is below 5.07 m on an average .being 0.25 m dropping compared with that
of the previous vear. Before the irrigation started. the buried depth of groundwater level in Luohuiqu irrigation
district was 10-15 m. In 1950 after the irrigation began. the groundwater level went up sharpiv due to the
increase in irrigation water use and without drainage engineering facilities. In the 1950s, the veariy average
rising of groundwater level was 0.568, which was the peak rising stage since irrigation started. In the
1960s.great efforts were made to intensify irrigation management, perfection of field engineering and
drainage svstem so that the yearly average rising of ground water level was 0.266 m mainly due to the impact
from backwater from Sanmen Gorge reservoir area of the Yellow River. By the 1970s and 1980s,the yearly
average decreasing of groundwater level was 0.05 m, but that in some local area tended to rise. Entering into
the 1990s, the groundwater level goes up again due to the unsmooth drainage system and a decrease in
efficiency.     -  I
After the completion of GIIP, irrigation and drainage facilities will be completely improved and perfected.
Based on the drainage parameters, the area to be controlled under drainage will be 66.0 kha; and the depth of



Irainaae ditches wvill be '.Om - 3.Om in Jiaokou irrigation district. The area controlied unoer drainaue
cngineering will be 50.7, kha: and the depth of drainage ditches is 2.5m - 2.T m in Luoiiuiqu irrigatIon Cistric:.

After the .ompietion of the proiect. the groundwvater leveis in the two irrigation districts can be
controlled below\ the critical water level. As long as ihe management and maintenance of drainage facilities is
strengthened . mhe secondan soil saline- alkalization can be improved or avoided.
) SLuZgestionS on prevention of soii saiinization and aikalization
In Jiaokou irriication district. aDart from tne improvement of ihe existing drainage engineering pumping
Aells should be deveioped in combining with vertical drainage by well irrigation in the area with groundwater
mineralization less than '1fvL. Trees are pianted on a iarge scale in empty lands ;n villages and along the

ailkalizarion has aiready happened, such measures prior to the dropping of groundwater tabie below the criticai
depths irrigating wvater to suppress salts. increasing application of organic fertilizers, and practising crop stalks
and residues returning to the fields should be adopted to achieve the goal to improve saline-alkali soiis. For
:ne indivlidual medium  and heavv saline-alkali farmiands, such salt-toierant farm  crops as sor-hum.
sunflowers can be encouiaged to plant for eliminating salts.
in Luo0luiQU irrngation district. the controiled measures of putting drainage in the important position is
adoptec. also. it is suagested that such improvement and utilization measures as silt irrigation  tfor

ln Cl!1. :hcre aru the items of improvement of drainage engineerine with purpose of controlling over soil
water-foLging in Baolixia and jinhuiqu irrigation districts.
The improvement items of drainage engineering in Baojixia involve the improvement of Xinwu main
draina-e ditch and Duanjia main drainage ditch with the area under control being 3275 ha and $171 ha with
he depth of draina,e ditches being 1.8 - 2.' m -therebv covering the cultivated farmland with open water-
Ogging and with the buried depth of groundwater less than I meter.
After the implementation of the engineering, the buried depth of groundwater in the service range of
Xinwu drainage main ditch and Duanjia drainage main ditch will be controlled below 1.8-2.2 m so that soil
water-logging will be improved. Great attention should be paid to the repairing of existing main and lateral
canais and ditches in the rest of other sections with buried depth of groundwater level less than 3.0 m. Also,
monitoring should be intensified to prevent groundwater from rising.

The Imolementation items of drainage engineering in Jinhuiqu irrigation district include the imorovement
of Niehe.Linvu.Tanzhanc-g drainage main ditches. Rencun draina2ye svstem and Wutong main drainage ditch
with a depthi of 2.0 - 4.7 m. serving a drainage area of 49.16 Oha and covering the ootential water-iogging
sections. Atier the impiementation of the improvement drainage ensineering. the buried depth of groundwater
can be expected to controi below 2.0 m so that soil water-logging problem can be solved
The land surface of Yanumaowuan irrigation district is in general with a big slope gradient failing into
the piedmont alluvial tan plain and loess tableland and terraces. After the implementation of G1IP. diverting
.Aater trom  Fen!gjiashan reservoir to Yansmaowuan reservoir will make Yangmaowuan irrigation Jiistrict
increase surface irrigation water of *0 million mrnvear. however. the area witl the buried depth of

The organophosphide agro-chemicals are easy to decompose when meeting with base. Although
zroundwater is buried shallow in Luohui and jiaokou irrigation districts,water quality in the region appears to
De alkaline because agro -chemicals in soils 'infiltrate into groundwater. Even very small quantity of
organophosphides infiltrates into groundwater, it will be soon defraded in the presence of alkaiine kvater.Only
a p)art of Aminobenzorc acid esters including Furadantin and temik which is used to eliminate soil pests may
tave some harmful effect upon soil microorganism. some of which may infiltrate deep into groundwater
jrerebv ;o affect wvater qualitv. Nevertheless. this kind of agrochemicals can only be used in cotton fields in
iaoiokU ana luohui irriaation districts. With non irrigation district included. the area in use of them is oniv i3-
:0 ki;a. wnich can oniv produce very little effect upon the whoie.
.At\e:r :;he State Council published << Regulations for Agrochemicals Management>> in 1997. Shaanxi
People's Government issued << the Notice for Strengthening Agrochemical Management of Shaanxi
?rovmnciai People's Government>> in 1998; and Shaanxi Agricultural Department also worked out a series of
;mrnementing suvcestions for strengthening agrochemicals management and instructed Shaanxi Provincial
)tfce of arrochemical Management and Identification to exercise rights of enforcing laws. Accordinaiv,
i,aanxi Provincial Office of Agrochemical Management and Identification has intensified the recording of
.aro-0-cemicals and insecticides saie use and supervision and management of market quality. The orfice hias
.:so  _stabiished  agrocnemical monitoring  and  analvsis  labs equipped  with  colormetric  meter and
_ascnrotograpnic meter and the advanced agro-chemical monitoring and analvsis instruments .At the same
nme. ne networks of agrochemical quaiitv supervision and safe use technical guidance at provincial,
Orelectural and countv levels is under establishment. All this will have an active effect upon safe use of agro -
chemicals and reduction of pollution.
5..5 Chemical Fertilizer Application
The main farm crops in Guanzhong irrigation districts are wheat, corn and cotton. In recent vears. fruit
tree pianting is rather popular in the irrigation districts. An amount of chemical fertilizer application in each
irriLyation district is shown in Table 3-10. The N.P.K fertilizer application rate is 1:0.56:0.11. The conditions of
chemical fertilizer application to farm crops are shown in Table 5-9. Based on the yields of various crops and
nutrient elements required, Soil and Fertilizer Research station of Shaanxi Agricultural Department has
worked out the best amount of chemical fertilizer application to guide the farmers to fertilize their
farmlands.(see Table 5-10).
The control Table 5-9 and Table 5-10 can illustrate the N and P fertilizer application conditions, which
are basicallv the best amount of fertilizer application determined by Soil and Fertilizer Research Station.After
91



the implementation of GIIP. the irrigation area of 180 kha will be improved and perfected: and the enlarged
area under irrication wiil be 49.33 .ha 'see Table '-3). In these farmiand sections. anc  wing to the
improvement or irrigation states. planting patterns will be adjusted. For instance. the area to be planted with
veizetables and truit crops will be increased. It can be expected the an amount of chemical fertilizer
application will be increased.. see Table 5-1 1).
Research conducted bv the Northwest A.riculturai Universitv indicates that at present there is a large
amount of mineraiized N accumulation in the depth of 1-4 m of soil layer in irrigated and rainfed farmiands.
of which N03-N accounts for 60-70°/o. Also, research conducted bv Soil and Chemical fertilizer Institute of
Shaanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences indicates that in the case of high N application (375kg/ha), the
leaching- losses are equai to 38.2% of N application. Therefore. after the implementation of GIIP. and with the
improvement of irrization conditions. the leaching losses of N fertilizer will increase in some sections therebv
to bring about some effect upon local water qualities. Accordingly, the following measures should be adopted:
1 I )   It should be strengthed that the monitoring of soil and water : Sampling spots will be perfectIV
ncreased.
It is necessary to controi N-fertilizer use properlv and to practise scientific balance fertilization
in accordance wvith crop N diemand and not to overuse N fertilizer.
Scientific :rrihation must be practiced with the principle of small amount of water use in more
:imes. Flood irrigation should be prohibited. Irrigation must I,e conducted in accordance with crop
;%ater reouirement in combination with fertilizer application so as to ensure crops to make full use of
x\ater and to reduce water losses.
4)      ..Agronomic  measures should be adopted to utilize NO;-N in soil to the fullest extent.  i.e. rhe
rotational  patterns can make crop roots in deep  layer and shallow laver take their  advantages ot
Liluizin- NO,-N in each soil laver so as to reduce leaching layers.

5.o. R\esettlement Action Plan
There \iii a:e 841 persons to be removed for the settlement in 3 reservoir en-ineerina. in baoJixia
reserVoir area. two ways for migrant settlement will be adopted. The first is to remove the mierants afterward
:n ,he newki-de veloped area. viz. leaving their native farmiand not leavingz their township: and the seconc is to
remove a part or miTrants outside the area. The farmlands will be readjusted because the inundated farmiand
can cause the reduction to the farmland heid bv some farmers. Therefore. the engineering measures shouid be
.adopiedd to raise per unit area crop yieid so as to secure Der caoita -rain production and income of migrated
0ousein.1i s ano those in the settlement region no less than those prior to their migration.

It can be seen from the table that population capacity in the settlement area is over the population to be
settled. Through the analvsis of 4 water resources engineering, the cultivated land vields and population
capacitv can satisfv the requirement. After the removement of migrants. the living standard and customs of the
migrants will be affected to some extent in a short period. However. after the implementation of the migration
action plan. the migrants will soon achieve their living standard prior to their removement.

environment is stable and GIIP impiementation will produce no new environmental problems oI various
k-inds.

The survev of the public opinions indicates that GIIP is an engineering that xill produce an act'.e
Law.t uPon natural and social environments. The public are ver! in favor of GIIP and aiso ihold that GiP '.i
.ot aroduce new environmental problems. and .herefore thev are urgent for the starting of t'his benei`c:ai
tnu!n-eerin- project. The migrants are aiso satisfied with the migration settlement arrangement. At the Mame
:ime. the -nvironmental capacitv in the settlement area is able to guaranree that the mi -ranrs' 'ivin2 uuaia%

zjiufed to the mnarket management thereby fixing tne responsibility  of managenment and
m,ainenance so as to raise vater use efficiencv and lower water fee and reduce the farmers heavy
nordcns. The further reforin measures such as siiareholding system. shareholding cooperation
Wvstcm and water user association and other diversified operations suggested in the report are also
:ICe  ractical and feasible. Therefore. the current progress and practical cases shouid  be
;uooicmented in the system reforms of imgation districts.
-. Te expected price level for water fee has been estimated in accordance with No.726
uocumcnt --- <<The management specifications for estimation of water fee cost of water
conservancy engineering>> and some regulations set in << The economic evaiuation specification of
w%ater works construction>> issued in 1994 by the Ministrv of Water Resources in close combination
With the actual conditions in Guanzhong irrigation districts so that water supply cost is 0.276
Yluanimi.. which will be used as the base for working out water fee price after the completion of
GIIP
4.  In accordance wvith << The outline for migrant settlement general action plan (RAP)> of
the wvorld Bank- and «< The migrant settlement regulations for large-and medium sized water
consernancv and hydroelectric power engineering of the People's
Republic of China>>. the detained investigation has been carried out into the reservoir

reservoir construction engineering in Sanvuan counrt  where there needs to make the sertlement
arrangement of nigrants. through the fuill coordination with local governments and the migrants. the
practcal aid I'easible settlement scheme has been w\ork-ed out with reliable measures so that the
migrants can be rightly arranged in their settlement.
5.   The implementation of GIIP will iimpro\e the ability- for agnculture to resist environment
risks. incrcase rcgulating and storaze of water and raise imrgation guarantee efficiency amid produce
the active cflect upon agricultural productloii and the improvement ot' regional eco-envirounment and
LtIere will be no new environment problems.
The cniargemenc and improvement of cngxneenng of the west main canal in Luohuiqu
imgation distnct was originally piannued to carry our thie silting irrgation of 30000 mu saline bank
lands. But owving to the fact that  banLkland area is located in the low-lying but liable to water-
logginig area. and the drainage facilitics are inipoctect. silting imgation x'vill affect drainage in other
oursidc regions. And hence. this oroiect will niot be implemented for the time being through
discussions .
5   This report also suggests that xvater-saviiig irriation teciuiology planning be extended il
he irri-aLion districis. For thils reason. ;he canals at %arious levels should be first lined. the advanced
arodenri water-saving irrigation tecnnolog  shouild be actively introduced so that the demonsrration
zones can be set up to carry out its extension.
7.   The specific Ceasibility studs reports of 7 groups conicernng canal junctions and
rescroirs. canals. pumping statLions. drainage. wvater resources. niediun-iowv yielding farmland
imDrovement. inf'rastructure facilities and nex technoiogv extension for GIIP have been worked out.
.Also. thc collection of design drawings has been completed. Accordingly. the times of rnaior
zn xineering havc reached their iiiiiai design depth. The cost estimanon of engineering has been
aoiioulcd in accordance with the WVorld Banik iatest unit price.
