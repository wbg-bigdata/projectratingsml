Because there are a lot of projects in the improvement enaineering, the
review  scope is so wide and thie en-vironment condition is multiple. it is
difficult to describe in details some typical environment issues in a sinaie
review  report owina to the limit of the report lenath and we compose in
additioii the appendix report in special.
This appendix report .onsists of seven appendices. and the following
issues are described in details. water quality of Weihe river, water qualitv of

Review of Water Qualitv of
Weihe River
Weihe River origins from the Wushu Mountain in Weivuan Count
Gansu Province, flows across three provinces, Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi.
and converges to the Huanghe River at Tongguan. It is the largest branch
with the 8 1 8 km of the length, I- .477km: of the total basin area and 502km
of the length in Shaanxi Province. The annual run-off is 7.63 billion m3 and
the annual sediment run-off is 0.423 billion tons.
At thie middle and dow,n stream of Weille is the rich Guanzhong Plain.
On tihe main stream three irrigyation diversion kev projects have been
constructed and they are Baojixia plateau-up diversion project located at the
Baoiixia narrow, Baojinxia plateau-bellow diversion project located at
XVeiiiabu and Jiaokou project fOr pumping ftrom 'WVeihe River.

The above table 1 -3 indicates that Xi' an. the provincial capital city,
disrinbutes the most to the pollution of Weihe Rivter wvhatever the wastei
water. CODcr or petroleum materials. Xi'an discharges almost half of the
nvaste wvater and other main pollutant, the nex<t three cities are Xiangyang,
Baoji and Weinan. The waste drainage of other counties located in the both
...banks of Weihe River differ a little. So the main pollution sources of Weihe



River are the four large cities.
There are a north main channel and a south main channel in Baojixia
irrigation area. The north main channel get the water from Linjiacun
diversion dam which is 13 km far from Baoji city. So except to the possible
pollution from the upstream Gansu Province, this section of the river almost
hias not been polluted within the border of Shaanxi Province and the water
quality is so good. The south main channel get the water from Weijiabu
diversion dam w-hich is 1 km far from the Meixian Countv. And the water
quality are affected by the industrial waste water and sanitarv waste water
discharged from Baoiji City, Baoji Countv and Qishan County. So the
discharging of the polluted and waste water from Baoji Citv must be
controlled to improve the water quality in this section for irrigation. Now
"Research of the Using of the Waste Water of Baoji Citvy. a  ninth five
subject. is being researched. The water quality of this section of Weihe River
'il be improved if the subject succeed and be applicated.
Jiaokou irrigation area bv pumping water from Weihe River lies on the
border land of Xi'an and Weinan. Except to the pollutant carried from the
upstream. the water quality of this section of the river is mainlv affected by
tile waste water discharged from the near Xi' an and XianLnang. So the
discharging of the polluted & waste water and pollutant from Xianvang and
Xi' an must be controlled to improve the water quality of this section of
Weihe River.
. The review of the existing pollution condition of the water quality of
Weihe River
There are 13 perennial water quality monitor sections located by our
provincial environment departments in the section of Weihe River in
Shaanxi Province, and the water quality data of many years have been
obtained. To analyze the water quality of Weihe River in recent years, we
collected all the water quality data of each section of the wet and dry years



*from  1996 to 1997 with 11 pollution subjects. The data are enough to
illustrate the existing condition of the water qualitv. The results are listed in
table 1-5 and table 1-6. The wet season are July and September, the dry
season are JanLuarv and March, and the medium season are Mav and
November. Two months are monitored in each season and two days in each
month. So the data in the tables are the average values of 4 monitored data
and are statistic.
The standard applicated for the review is the state - Quality Standard
of the Ground Water Environment  '( GB383S-88 ), see in table 1-4. The
review method is comparing. We compare the measured pollutant value of
eaclh section of the river to be reviewxved to the five standards or classes iLn
table 1-I. then judpe the water quality class for each pollutant material of
each section in eachi season. If the standard exceeds the class V. a mark
V ' xiill be used to describe it. The class of the heaviest factor of the
pollution is used as the water quality class of each section. The review
results are ilisred in table 1-7 and table.1-8.
According to table 1-7 and table 1-8, the existing condition of the water
polutI'Otl can be described as the following.
Among the 13 sections located on Weihe River. the water qualitv is
uic' onix at Linjiacun section. Between 1996 to 1997. almost all the
mcn;1:)nnu subjects can meet the class III except that the permanganate
index and non-ionic ammonia exceed it.
e2) SB far the h1eavy metal pollution in Weihe River is not serious. Hg,
Cd and Pb pollution can meet class III, and can meet class I in most of the
time Tlie perennial data also indicate that As, Zn, and Cu pollution is not
senous and the pollution degree is as same as that of Hg, Cd and Pb
although the results have bot been listed in table 1-5 and table 1-6.
(3) The Cr- pollution tends to be more seroius down from the Tieqiao
section. At the section the water quality can meet class I, and the water

Luaiitv of class IV and V appears down from  the section. This may be
because of the drainage from  Xianvang and Xi' an. Also there are some

water guide slots like" I    "             are inserted. Leaching using
water from Weihe is to be proceeded ( keeping the depth of the upper water
layer 2 cm ) .The upper leaching was started at 10:20 on July 31 rn 1998 .
Dripping started from the upper hole at 5:00 on August 1 in 1998 , from the
middle hole at 7:40, and from the lower hole at 9:10 . Drip bottles with the
capacity of 800 ml were placed to collect the water from each :ci-cl. ''n
August 3 in 1998, there had been water of 600 ml in the upper bcotle at 9K:' 5,
in the middle bottle at 16:40, and in the lower bottle at 17:3_. So the
Dripping speed is different. The leaching test used water of 7000O m1 .T-he
;ripp ing speed at each hole were calculated as O. 17 mi/min t:e ,  ^._
mn/min at the middle, and 0. 17 ml/min at the lower.
Th-e weight of the soii used in the leachi..g test s 35.5 kg  T-e W~'i;:e

Agricultural Environment Quality Review
N.                Of Guanzhong Irrigation Districts
The monitoring data of water and soil of the irrigation disti.cts are
applied to review  the agricultural environment which are r-^m  the
environment protection station of Shaanxi Province.
1. The monitoring and analysis method of the agricultural envirz.mer.
1.1 According to the source of irrigation water and the a`- : w:e
review, the sample positions are set in the representative domains in te
lrigatorn districts. There are 12 waLer quality monitoring sec::on"S S5_
soil monitoring positions and 9 crop sampling positions.
1 .2Sa piing method.
Wlater quality samples are collected from the e;hanne's ano .-e
water sources in irrigation seasor, and fixer are added at t-He size. .-e
soil sampies are collected in the harvest season, and the foilowiLg s u-e
mnet o. Around the monitoring position, 5 pieces of lan  re se:ez:c v
soi: sam:pes are zoliectec accordi-.g to tie diagonai -rzcess,  --e-
mix.ng o: -he samples, 1 kg of the mixture soil are col ece, agged
with a label , and took back to the lab. The crop samples are zoilect.ed at
the sa.me i..e and ,si;.g the same method of the soil sam:Ung,  .- _
of the oro sample are collected, 10 kg of the fruit samipe are zo_i:ec..
The detih of the soil sampling is 3-20 cm for crcp     aneit a .;     for
4:r i+4 .1eC.
1 .3 I reatment of the samples.
7he water sampies must be refrigerated and tested as soc- as
prossibie. The soil sampies must be air dried in the lab,
decontaminated, milled, sifted, mixed and finally put into a bottle .c be
tested. The crop samples must be air dried and clean the surface deo-sit
ujilder and then dried, milled, and put into a bottle to be teste.
1.4 Monitoring of the existing condition of environmnetai quality.
Evaluation factor and analysis method. See table 5-1.

2. Existing condition evaluation
2.1 Evaluation method
The pollution index method of single factor and the aeneral quality
index method are applied.
2.2 Evaluation model
Ci
single factor Pi =     . general quality index P = s Pi
Si
in the formula, Pi ----pollution index of single factor
Ci----measured value of pollutant material I
Si----review standard of pollutant material I
P---general quality index
n---amount of the pollutant materials
If Pi > 1, that means the measured value of the pollutant materials
exceeds the standard, and the larger Pi is, the more seriously pollution
appears.
If Pi < 1, that means the measured value of the pollutant material
.,satisfy the standard.
2.3 Review factor and review standard. See in table 5-2.

2.3 Existing condition of ecological environment
2.3.. Vegetation condition
.ne main vegetation is natural second growth. The   fi  :iszt lies
-orm; ally in the districts where people's activity is frequent. :-e -mnain :rees are
oak, poplar, lacquer, pine, apple, walnut, etc. The major meacow is creeping-
grass, wormwood etc. The artificial grass are aifalfa, ciover etc. in general, tne
vegetation of the district is poor, and this is the main reason that there is serious



water & soil loss in the district.
2.3.2 Ecological environment
The home range of the people is extensive around the reservoir.  -e
original vegetation has been destroyed after 30 years of plcugh, ard3 'he ex:st'g
is second vegetation. The animal are oniy mice, hares and snrakes w:± scme
specific wild animals coming from the south Qinling Mountai. r.ii' Wnt+er. There

2.6 Investigation of the pollution source
2.6.1 In Gansu Province
Weihe origins from Gansu province, and flows across the industrial city,
Tianshui City, 40 km away from the border of Baoji County. The industrial
waste liquid of Tianshui is discharged into Weihe. This is the main pollution
3ou.ce so that sometimes there is bubbies and black liquid amPearing about the
section of the border between Shaanxi and Gansu.
2.6.2 in Baoji County
(i 3ndustrial pollution source
According to the investigation, there is no ndustrai ente--ses :n we
zounty, and no poiluticn source. At the left bank of Weihe, there is a nationai
-e..ense storehouse above the elevation of 644.Om and 6km away from the dam.
Trhe waste water from the storehouse is not pollutant because the storehouse
checks itself every year.
() Agricultural pollution source
ne upstream basin of Weihe is winding mountain area of soil and rock
.-. ;Z I-1i:ies. The slc;e is so steep that there s ii..le sClil. he siope area is
1 885.a2 k2 ,and a quarter can be ploughed. The major crops are wheat, corn,
an-. the mnajor economic crops are fruit, crude drugs, etc. The major fertilizer is
farmyard manure. Little chemical fertilizer is applied,  and t.ere is little
residue in the soil.
(3 ) Lives pollution source
The district is wide and the population is not dense. The population density
is 40 people per km2. The lives waste water seeps down into the ground. The
major energy sources for-lives arecrop sterr and firewood, and the- aslr are tcrbe--
used as fertilizer.

increases by 2Jm., the water flow will oe siower, the der.urrage -w:.:. ce onger,
great amount of sediment will silt, the transparency oft-he water st tne a ront
will increase. The sediment particle will absorb organic ard grea: anlt zf
heavy metal while sinking. The absorbed heavy metal is not easy t oe esese. and
will not cause the second pollution.
At the beginning of the filling of the reservoir, s^me wee-s, organic
materials and humic matter will be submerged, and then decay and discomposed.
The nutritional salt will accumulated and is advantageous to the phytoplankton
bloom and development. The oxygen in the water will be consummated. B3ut the



runoff is larger than the capacity of the reservoir, and the turbulent and mixing
fluctuation is strong, the oxvgen will be rapidly added to the waters, and the
water quality of the reservoir will not deteriorated.
The nutrition depends on the concentration and demurrage of the
nutritional salt. After the gate is added , The reservoir is an incomplete annual
adjusting reservoir with the capacity of 32 million m3.When the reservoir
discharae sediment during July to October, the nutritional salt, oxygen and
phosphorous, accumulated in the reservoir will be discharged as the sediment.
The concentration of nutritional salt will be reduced. Germanv and Holland
defines the normal nutrition as COD = 5 m.g/L. The COD concentration in the
water of Weihe is 3.3 mg!L, and will reduce by self-cleaning. So the water of the
reservoir is poorly nutritional.
3.3 Analysis of environmental capacitv of waters
The organic COD is selected to evaluate the environmental capacitv of
waters. The calculation mode is as the following.
W=----((Cs-Co) X V+KCsV-CsQ)
At
In the formula, W----environmental capacity of waters
A t----davs of dry season
Cs-----the water quality controlling parameter
Co----the first concentration
V----the safe capacitv of the reservoir
Q----the adjusting discharge of the reservoir with   safe
capacity
K----the natural decrement of the pollutant material
See the parameters selected for the analysis of environmental capacity of
waters in table 3-1.

3.5.4 Construction waste gas effects on environment
The major waste gas of construction comes from dam slope cutting,
blasting of dam foundation and middle holes. The minor is the toxic gas and
mill dust of the off gas of the vehicle and the fuel oil of the construction
machinery.
The artificial drilling biast is applied in rock excavation. According to the
monitoring in the construction of Longyangxia project, the density ^f MilI dust
is 40 g/m3 while drilling dry pores using air drill ( 20g/rn3 for wet pores), ard
8o-og/m3 wtwhile driiling dry pores in foundation pit, and exceeed -:ne ar
quality standard of environment of GB3095-96.
Some local mill dust of envirn.mental air during czns-c:izn execdeer
the stz..-   ad is 'armfi to the health of "me construcdion wcr-ers. _o
works should be shielded. Some toxic carbon monoxide an:d n-iz.ren Axize W,

work : aces exposes to the natural environment, the constructior, worKs a-e :ar
from .he work face; and the mill dust produced by the i'nsant bleast wil .e
b1owed off to the downstream plain by the gull wind, the miil dust will
influence the environment only instantly.

3.5.5 Noise effects on envirornment
Tle noise comes from  the construction blast, the machinery in {re
auxilierv factories and the vehicles.
The living quarters lies on the terrace 625.0m west to the cottage of Taivin,
and 600m away from the blast position. The noise will not poilute the
environment because of the prevention of the mountains, diffusion and fading in
-he-air ofthe soundwave although the noie6leverrshigYh.See tie n6i-se1 eVe"s of`

3.6 Analysis of the effects on environment
Bacjixia iricgation project is now the largest in Shaanxi  7-,vce. T.e
irrigazion area is 194.81 kha including the two systems                    =C ze  a:ea-z-   C

area of the plateau-below irrigation is 702kha_.
3.6.1 Review of the effects on the irrigation district



According to the analysis of the data of irrigation of 20 years, the
improving the environment is the main function of irrigation. The first, The
irrigation has increased the capacity of combat natural dry adversities, and
offered the people in the irrigation district a stable labor and living environment.
According to an investigation, the yield of the crops is 2290.5 'kg/ha, and --se to
9945 kg/ha, four times of the former yield. The second, the irrigation has
improved the ecological environment of the dry loess -iateau. 3efore e
:rr.gation project started working, there were few trees on the Olatea"    - :e.

T.e irrigation also have negative effects on the envi rn=ent, an ,-, .nator

..n:e:_ :una wa,_r was `5.41m , the minimum was :       a.d -e na~n:m
was i 28.4m  before inigation. Since the irrigation started in  1971. Lhe
unae"Zro und water level began to rise. By 1985, the mean embecdez ze-th of
the u-dnaerround water in the district were 37.2;m, and -he undergrzu1n  vater

anG sometimes naked underground water appeared Locaily. Accor:    o  Iz:-e
.s.taTPic from Baojixia management bureau, the area of -he naked underaround
water was 39 ha in 1980, and developed to 1684 ha in 1983. Srince   R3 sx
drainage system, Duanjia, Zhaogong, Zhousu, Zhaozhen, Dianzhang, and
Dizhang, had been built, and the area of naked underground water has been
controlled, reduced to 390 ha in 1989.
3.6.2 Analysis of the influence of the irrigation' compiement of tfhe
reservoir on the environmenL
(1) The water shortage of the plateau is great. After the gate-added



engineering finished, 80 million m3 of water will be complemented to the
plateau and release the water shortage of the irrigation district. According to the
irrigation experience of the district, the irrigation can greatly increase 'he yields
of grain and oil crops. While the gate-added engineering finished, the reservoir
can complement water, the peasants can irrigate at proper. t:me, 'he agncaltura2
yield will be high and stable. the ecologicai environment will e improved as
well.
(2) According to the monitoring data of the water c:aiiy, a   -e wa-er
.ua. .7y at _L-jiacun hydrolog-cal staticn can m.eet  e o--r      a _

un_.Re-7CoUnc water according to the analysis of the ahydrolgical a-  ecgigcai
conc. nns of the district. Because the underground water will be Increased, the
,ccta 'iseharge wili increase. Following the flow direction o-f the _ .e u..
water of -he district, from northwestern to southeastern, scme of the increasec
ischarged  water will flow  as  underground  runcff, to   _.1_ele.-   the
overexploited underground water of the irrigation area below the plateau.
(4) The underground water level of the irrigation district on the plateau
keeps rising perennially, and the complemented water from the reservoir will
greatly accelerate the rising speed of the underground water. According to the



analysis and calculation of the existing data, the perennial increment of the
rising speed of the underground water is 0.24m. The environmental problems
caused by the rising of the underground water level concent-ated, accordi.ng 'G
the analysis of the land form and geology of the district, in the bottom lands,
such as Duanjia, Zhaogong, Zhousu, Zhaozhen, Dianzharg and Dizhang, etc..
(5) The salt content in the soil in the district is normally low, and no salting
stain has been found while investigating. But the acCuL .uUatizn o^ sa; in ..e

4.2 Measures for water and soil protection
The area is low loess hills west to the reservoir, with deep gulls and steep
--=- -{slopes and-poorvegetationr cover. Thei wate"ancdF soil loss is- seribThels   - 
erosion module is 1200-1500 t/km2. So the water and soil protection should be



proceeded at the upstream of the reservoir to release the har. of the water and
soil loss to the project.
(1) The flat slopes with thick soil layer near cottages should be and built to
be horizontal terrace. Ditch and ridge culture should be deveioec in, t*ne field
which can not be built to terrace field.
(2) The slopes far away from cottages, with the degree ofthe slope mr,ore
than 25 and thin soil layer, should oe returned for far-ming 'o ^_rest. cs e  aliy
planting grasses is effective with little cost.

(4) The construction blasting and the transportation should be arranged at
daytime. When entering to the living areas, the vehicles should sl^w dcwn with
no screaming of the homs to release the disturbing the environment.



(5) The sanitary and medical organization should be established, and the

6. Conciusions of the review
(1) In the area up the Baojixia Narrow, the water quality can meet the class
III of the " environmental quality standard of groundwater" C-B3838-88, and
will not decrease while the project will be constructed.
(2) There is no environmental and geological factor limiting the
construction of the project. The construction of the gate-added engineering will
not seriously influence the environment and geology in the reservoir area.



(3) The construction of the project will increase the agricultural products
and benefit of the irrigation district of Baojixia
(4) In the period of construction, the influence on the environment is little,
but the environment protection in the construction area should be done we'll.
(5) Tne influence of the construction of the project is great on the social
environment. There are 841 to immigrate under the immigration clan.
(6) The investigation of the public views indicates that people are support
the project and hope it be constructed as soon as possible.

Environmental quality standard for salt
(GB 15618-1995)
The standard is implemented to execute " laws of environment
protection of RPC ", protect ecological environment, safeguard the
agriculture and forestry and people's health.
1. Topic contents and scope of application
1.1 Topic contents
The standard defined, according to the soil applicatior. unction,
protecting objects, and the major soii Chlaracters, the highest   -i tteA
contents of poilutant substanrces and the monitoring methods.
1.2 Scope of application
Tie ^Sanard can be appiied for the soil of farmniand, -iege:ale n_--1,
.ea field.  it land, forest land and natural protecticn disr.ct.
2. Terms
2. Soil. is -he !oose layer on the surface of the earth whe-e g-een z:a
live.
:.: i o -.r. exchange capacity of soil, the quantity of cation absor-ed OS vhe
soil ciloid with negative electricity, measured as the totai moies Of the
cation co De substituted in 1kg of soil.
3. Soil environmental quality classifying and standard grades
3.1 Soil environmental quality classifying
According to the application functions and protecting objects, soils can



be divided to three classes
Class I can be applied for the state-defined protection district(except
for that with high contents of heavy metals), collective drinking water
source area, tea land, herding land and other soils in protection land. Tne
soil quality keeps the natural background level.
Class II can be applied for normal farmland, vegetable land, tea land,
herding land, etc.. The soil quality is almost no harmful to and -oiiuLing -he
plants and environment.
Class MT can be applied for forest land, soils with higc cnents -T
poilutant substances and high background values, and ;he farmla near
mineral ore (except for vegetable land). Tne soii quailty U2's iS   n -^
liarmfui to and poiluting the plants and environment.
3.2 Standard grades
-rade 1, is the limited value to protect the locai -a.ra. ecoiegy an'
ieez the soii environmental quality with the naturai background.
Grade 2, is the limit values to safeguard the agricuiture and the
people's health.
G_rade 3, is the limit values to safeguard the agriculture and forestry and
.he living of piants.
-. e eiasses oi'the soil should submit the grdes as the foilowing,
Class I submits grade 1,
Class II submits grade 2,
Class iII submits grade 3.
4.Standard values
