SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1701-PO)
PREFACE
This report deals with the first integrated Small and Medium Scale
Industry (SMI) ProJect financed by the Bank in Portugal. Loan 1701-PO, in
the amount of US$45 million, was approved by the Bank's Board of Directors
on May 17, 1979 and became effective on August 29, 1980. The loan was made
to the Government of Portugal to be alIocated as follows: (i) US$33 million
to be on-lent to participating banking institutions for financing of SMI
investment projects; (ii) US$9.5 million to be on-lent to EPPI for the
development of its Industrial Estates Program; (iii) US$2.5 million to be
used for other activities with potential impact on the development of the
SM sector.
The attached Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared based on
information provided by IAPMEI, EPPI and LNETI, and information available
in the Bank files. No special mission was mounted to prepare the PCR.
Comments received from the Borrowers have been taken into account as
appropriate in finalizing the report and are reproduced as Annex 14.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1701-PO)
uIGELIGHTS
(i)      The project aimed at the modernixation and expansion of SMI through
an integrated package of fitancial and technical assistance, which included:
(a) investment lending, and technical assistance by IAPHEI; (b) development of
industrial estates in less developed regions of the interior; (c) equipment of
LUSTI laboratories, consultants and training; (d) export promotion; and (e)
studies. The project was also expected to influence industrial policies in
Portugal, and to play a catalytic role in attracting other foreign sources of
financing to the SKI sector.
(ii)     Progress under the different components of the prbject was mixed.
While the project was essentially successful in meeting its objectives for the
development of S[Is - including the institutional strengthening of IAPMEI and
the participating financial institutions - it fell considerably short of
meeting the objectives cited under (b) and (d) above. In retrospect, the
project appears to have been too complex in design and ambitious in scope for
the first operatiou of this type in the country (para 3.03). Project imple-
mentation was delayed by difficulties in meeting the numerous conditions of
effectiveness in a timely manner, and was also adversely affected by the dif-
ficult and changing political and economic conditions in Portugal (para 3.04).
The original allocation of Bank funds was therefore significantly amended by
reallocating funds to the SMI credit line component (para 3.05).
(iii)    The project contributed significantly to the modernization and
expansion of SMIs by increasing their access to medium and long-term loans
(para 3.07). The project provided investment financing to 475 firms, and
contributed to the creation of 6,400 jobs at a moderate cost per job
(para 3.10). The operational performance of subprojects has been generally
satisfactory considering the difficult economic conditions in the country, but
export performance has been lower than expected (para 3.14). The financial
condition of the firms has also been affected by cost overruns, high interest
rates, and short maturities and grace periods of subloans; however, only 13S
of the firms had rescheduled their subloans or -.ere in arrears (para 3.15).
(iv)     The project also contributed significantly to the strengthening of
the appraisal capabilities of up to twelve participating financial institutions
(para 4.01). IAPMEI played a very active role of coordination and promotion
under the project, and also made significant progress towards the design and



- v -
implemntation of technical assistance programs to SMIs (para 4.02).  However.
its effectiveness and performance are hampered by its personnel policies
(para 4.03). Institutional strengthening is beinf continued under the, second
SMI project (para 4.04).
(v)      The demand for the industrial es.ates was overestimated.  Construction
of buildings in five estates (the sixth estate was never started) was 342 of
what had been planned (para 3.16). Because of low occupancy of the estates,
low equity contributions, high interest rates, and low rents on some old
contracts, EPPI's financial situation is critical (para 3.17).
(vi)     Purchasing of LNETI's equipment was substantially delayed and funds
for consultants and training remained unused due to budgetary constraints
(para 3.18). The program for export promotion to be financed under the project
lost Government support and was never implemented (para 3.19). Two studies
were successfully carried out under the project (para 3.20).
(vii)    Other points of interest referred to:  the limited effect of the
project on broad policy issues (para 3.02); the effectiveness of the e;emption
of subloans from credit ceilings (para 3.06); the catalytic role of the project
in attracting other foreign sources of funds to the SMI sector (para 3.07); the
effect of the devaluation of the Escudo against the US dollar on withdrawals
from the Bank loan (para 3.09); the concentration of firms in arrears among CGD
clients (para 3.15); and improvements in subproject appraisal and supervision
under the second SMI project (paras 4.03 and 4.04).

sMALL AND MEDrum sCALE INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1701-PO)
I.  INTRODUCTION
1.01     Loan 1701-PO in the amount of US$45 million was designed to develop
the finncial and technical aesistance to Small and Medium Industry (8HI) in
Portugal in order to realixe more fully its potential for growth, exports and
employmnat generation. Institution-building was being combined with improve-
ments in the incentive and policy framework for industrial exports in
preparation for Portugal's accession to the EEC. The loan, approved in May
1979, was the first Bank operation in the SNI sector in the country. It was
complementary to a prior US$50 million Bank loan to Banco de Fomento Nacional
(BFN) for larger industrial projects approved in 1977, and it was followed by
a second SKI loan of US$40 million approved in April 1983.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origins uf the Project
2.01     Following the revolution of April 1974, Portugal's political and
economic systems were substantially transformed. Among the changes, banks and
large companies were nationalized, trade union activity was legalized, and
colonies obtained their independence. The international economic environment
worsened after the first oil crisis of 1974. The Portuguese Government tried
to meet the expectations created by the revolution through rapid increases in
money wages and government transfers. This led to growing balance of payments
deficits, high levels of inflation, falling domestic savings and private
investment, and rising unemployment. A stabilization program was adopted in
mid-1978: the currency was devalued, credit was restricted, interest rates
were increased to marginally positive levels in real terms (although an
interest subsidy scheme was improved), the import tariff structure was
rationalized, and import surcharges were eliminated. SMIs were then expected
to be a key element of the economic recovery.
2.02     In 1977, about 27% of gross output from manufacturing was exported.
Small and Medium Industry (less than 400 workers) accounted for about 50S
of value added and 652 of employment in manufacturing, and was predominant
in export-oriented activities such as textiles, footwear, furniture, fish
processing and metal products (more labor intensive activities). However,
SMIs needed strong financial and technical assistance for improving
productivity and product quality, diversifying production, opening new
markets, and preparing for Portugal's accession to the EEC, then being planned
for 1985. Moreover, deficiencies had been identified in export incentives and
institutional support for manufacturing exports.
Expectations and Oblectives
2.03     The project aimed at reducing some of the deficiencies that
constrained the development of SMI, and it was also expected to play a
catalytic role in attracting other foreign sources of financing to the SMI
sector. More specifically, the project objectives were to:
a) support the modernization and expansion of SMI in the perspective of
Portugal's accession to the EEC;
b) generate foreign exchange earnings or savings;
c)  create and maintain jobs in SMI at a moderate capital cost per job;
d) bring new industries and entrepreneurs to the less develop3d regions
of the interior; and
e) assist the Government in formulating plans for: (i) development of
industrial technology and upgrading of production processes; and (ii)
restructuring and rationalization of the textile sector.

ProJect Description
2.04     The project was the Bank's first SMI development project in Portugal,
and included a Bank4 loan of US$45 million to be distributed as follows:
a) SMI Lending Program: A line of credit of US$33.0 million to finance
SMI investments through the network of Portuguese commercial banks
and specialized financial intermediaries, with the active involvement
of the Institute for the Support of the Small and Medium Industrial
Enterprises (IAPMEI), and with emphasis on export-oriented or labor
intensive subprojects, and subprojects located in the less developed
regions.
b) Industrial Estates Program: A line of credit of US$9.5 million to
help finance selected industrial estate projects by the Public
Enterprise of Industrial Estates (EPPI), and located away from the
congested coastal areas.
c) Technological Assistance Program: US$1.85 million to finance testing
and quality control equipment for the National Laboratory of
Engineering and Industrial Technology (LNETI), as well as for
consultant services and training abroad.
d)  Export Promotion Proram:  US$0.24 million to help finance an ITC
program of technical assistance to the Export Promotion }Fund (FFE)
which included a review of the structure of export incentives, export
marketing studies and the establishment of joint export marketing
schemes.
e)  Studies with Potential Impact on SMI:  US$0.41 million to finance a
textile sector study and a technology policy study which would
provide policy recommendations and would prepare future Bank projects.
2.05      In order to coordinate the above referred programs and enhance their
effectiveness towards the development of the SMI sector, the project also
included a series of complementary activities in the following areas: tech-
nical and technological Assistance to SMIs interested in the industrial
estates; identification, promotion and monitoring of export-oriented sub-
projects; collaboration among SMIs and between SMIs and larger enterprises,
domestic or foreign; creation of a committee to help administer the technolo-
gical assistance component; and preparation of a comprehensive 5-year plan for
the FmE. The Government also agreed under this project to strengthen the
budgetary and human resources of the FFE, to revise the interest subsidies
scheme, and to improve the programs of viability contracts and export
development contracts.

The Loan
2.06     Bank appraisal of the SMI project was carried out in July 1978.  A
post-appraisal mission visited Portugal in November 1978. The resulting
lending operation was approved by the Board on May 17, 1979. The loan was
made to the Government of Portugal, and featured an interest rate of 7.91, a
maturity of 15 years included 2 years of grace, and a fixed amortization
schedule. A special unit was created at Banco de Portugal for administration
of the credit line to be on-lent in local currency to the PBIs on a first-come
first-served basis. IAPMEI was in charge of quality control and processing of
subproject appra4sal reports. Funds earmarked for the industrial estates
program were on-lent to EPPI in foreign currency.
III. PROJECT EXECTrrON
The Political and Economic Environment (1980-84)
3.01     Implementation of the project occurred during a period of difficult
and changing political and economic conditions in the country. In 1980, one
year after the second sharp rise in oil prices, the coalition Government that
came into power was unable to maintain the tight monetary, fiscal and exchange
rates policies, particularly as regards the public sector. This led to an
acceleration of inflation and increasing balance of payments and public sector
deficits. The coalition Government fell in December 1982, and it was followed
by a caretaker Government for the next six months. In June 1983, a new
Government introduced an emergency stabilization program: the Escudo was
devalued, administered prices were increased, credit ceilings were reinforced,
and interest rates, which had been raised by 4% - 51 in March 1983, were
further increased by 2S in August 1983 (see Annex 1). Moreover, since
commercial banks were requiring advance payment of interest on short-term
loans, the effective cost of these borrowings could go up to 13S in real terms.
In September 1983, a new stand-by agreement was signed with the IMF. In June
1984, the interest rate structure was modified, and although the credit
ceiling mechanisms have been maintained in the essential, a more detailed
programming of the financing needs of the public sector, including public
enterprises, rendered decisions on the amounts of global credit easier and
more accurate within the scope of monetary programming, thus improving the
allocation of credit to the private sector. Lending interest rates started to
decline in 1985.
3.02     After a period of moderate but irregular growth durin_ 1980-82, GDP
declined slightly in 1983, and by 1.7% in 1984. The major share of the adjust-
ment fell on investment, which after grow4 i at an average annual rate of 7.7%
in 1980-82, declined by 28% during 1983-t. In manufacturing, export-oriented
industries increased output moderately, but industries oriented towards the
domestic market (e.g., metallurgy, chemicals and engineering) suffered badly.
Although much preparatory work was done during those years to develop a new
framework for industrial policy and investment incentives, only the system of
interest subsidies was slightly modified in 1983; it was made simpler for
small firms, and a greater weight was given to regional development. However,
delays in the payment of the subsidies may have reduced their effectiveness.

Also the banks, facing increasing arrears and a large demand for credit from
public enterprises which were no longer able to borrow abroad, became more
selective in extending credit to the private sector, which declined by 14S in
real termu during L983-84. In 1984 financial programming mechanisms were
adjusted, providing for better control over the borrowing requirements of
public enterprises. Credit ceiling mechanisms, however, were maintained
without change, and the fact that banks were not constrained by the ceilings
in their lending to the private sector had mostly to do with lack of demand
for credit, given the high level of interest rates and domestic economic
recession.
Comglexity of Project Design
3.03     The project was complex in design and ambitious in scope for the
first operation of this type in the country. It involved five government
agencies (IAPMEI, EPPI, LNETI9 mFE and GIT), Banco de Portugal, up to twelve
commercial banks and specialized financial intermediaries, and a large number
of components, subcomponents and interrelated activities. Moreover, the
institutional support for execution of the project was relatively weak and
inexperienced: IAPMEI had been created in 1;75; EPPI had started the
construction of the first industrial estate in 1977; LNETI was just being
reorganized; FFE was an ineffective institution; and commercial banks had just
started doing investment lending in 1977. Thiat constraint had been recognized
at time of appraisal, and supervision missions every six months plus interim
missions by consultants were recommended. However, even frequent missions had
difficulties supervising and assisting effectively on each of the components
and subcomponents of the project.
Start-uD Delavs
3.04     The start-up of the implementation of this project was substantially
delayed due to the institutional complexity, the large number of legal
documents and the numerous conditions of effectiveness. The Subsidiary Loan
Agreement between the Government and Banco de Portugal had to be changed to an
Agency Agreement, and the Bank Loan Agreement had to be accordingly amended
because Banco de Portugal was not authorized under its statutes to grant loans
to other credit institutions for periods over one year. Also the Government
could not reach a decision regarding the proposed new statutes of IAPMEI. The
delay led to a loss of momentum and political support of some of the conditions
and components of the project when the Government changed in January 1980,
seven months after signature of the loan. In particular, the new Government
did not support the proposed statutes of IAPMEI providing for greater autonomy
and better conditions of employment. The Bank finally agreed to waive this
requirement and the loan became effective in August 1980, fourteen months
after signature of the loan. The new Government also decided to revise the
priorities and policies regarding export promotion; thus this component of the
project was abandoned and funds were reallocated to the credit line component.

Comuitments and Disbursements
3.05     The allocation of Bank funde among the project components was the
subject of several,alterations according to their progress and funding needs,
which resulted in the final allocation presented in Table 3.1 below. The main
change in terms of amounts corresponds to a reduction in the EPPI component
from US$9.50 million to US$3.75 million or 39M of the original amount. The
LNETI component was slightly reduced in order to finance the extension of the
technology policy study, and the FFE component was cancelled. The SMI credit
line was then increased th US$5.99 million to US$38.99 million.  The US$50,000
for consultants and training abroad was never used. A total of US$1.46
million of the loan remained undisbursed and was cancelled, mainly due to the
devalvation of the Escudo against the US dollar.

3.06     Commitments under the credit line started slowly, and only 92 was
committed by April 1981, eight months after the loan had become effective.
Most of the participating banking institutions (PBIs) had excess liquidity
from time deposits, and were not interested in refinancing subloans from the
SMI credit line because the interest rate at which Bank funds were on-lent to
them, allowing for a spread of 3.5%, was higher than the return they could get
on their excess liquidity. After Banco de Portugal confirmed in May 1981 the
status of exclusion from credit ceilings for subloans refinanced by the Bank,
commitments grew rapidly to 56X of the credit line by August 1981, and 86% by
April 1982. Nonetheless, the last date of commitments of October 31, 1982 was
extended by 14 months because, first, the SMI credit line had been increased
by US$5.99 million, and second, disbursement delays added to the rapid
depreciation of the Escudo against the US dollar (by 41% during 1981-82 only)
caused partial cancellations in Bank subloans which were committed in US
dollars. In fact, both the number of subprojects and the total amount of the
subloans in real terms were around 40S higher than originally planned, whereas
the effective commitment period was only increased from 36 to 40 months.
3.07     It is difficult to measure the precise net contribution of the
project to the increase of medium and long-term financing made available to



the target group of SMIs elijible under the project, sirnce subloans financed
under the project represented less than 2% of the domestic medium and long-term
lending to manufacturing. However, it appears that the contribution was
substantial. First, commercial banks improved and e.iiarged investment credit
to a significant level in 1977. Second, the exemption from credit ceilings
proved to be an effective incentive for the PBIs. Third, the number of
financed subprojects represented about 52 of manufacturing firms in Portugal
between 10 and 400 workers, and 18% of firms between 50 and 400 workers.
Fourth, a large number of new firms, 113, were financed under the project.
tad fifth, commitments under the SMI credit line increased by 40S in 1983 when
domestic credit to the private sector declined by about 12%. In addition, the
project played a catalytic role in attracting additional foreign sources of
funds to the SMI sector, such as an EEC grant of US$ 10 million in 1982 which
was administered by IAPMEI, and several credit lines from EIB and KfW which
were channelled through BFN, CGDe and SPI. The net contribution of the second
SMI project currently under implementation appears less clear since, after the
credit ceilings mechanisms were adjusted in June 1984, some PBIs are not
constrained by the ceilings for lending to the private sector. As of March
31, 1986, about two-thirds of the second SMI credit line of US$ 40 million was
comnitted, but exclusion of SMI lending from the ceilings is no longer an
incentive for some PBIs. This situation may, however, improve as soon as
interest rates decline and the demand for credit increases.
3.08     Disbursements from the SMI credit line were slower than anticipated
at appraisal (see Annex 2), mainly due tc the postponement of the effectiveness
of the loan, the devaluation of the Escudo, and delays by the PBIs in
presenting the required documentation for withdrawal of funds during the
initial phase of project impl-ientation. Later on the rate of disbursements
increased and the closing u_ e was extended by only 9 months compared to the
14-month extension of the commitment date. The PBIs and IAPMEI were also slow
sometimes in processing subproject appraisal reports, which caused problems
with the rule of maximum 90 days retroactive financing by the Bank. Consi-
dering the additional time required for processing subprojects above the free
limit, the limit of 90 days was increased to 120 days for these subprojects.
The PBIs and IAPMEI have become more efficient in light of the experience, and
subproject processing has improved and is satisfactory under the second SMI
project.
3.09     The problem of low disbursements from the credit line due to the
devaluation of the Escudo was particularly relevant after the last date of
commitment of subloans, when further cancellations could not be reallocated to
new subprojects. Banco de Portugal then realized that, under its instructions,
based on a prior understanding with the Bank, the PBIs had been requesting
Bank refinancing of only 65Z of the subloans made to enterprises which was
generally lower than 65% of the investments in fixed assets (land excluded)
that was allowed under the Bank project. By claiming that difference, an
additional US$4 million was withdrawn, but US$0.76 million of the SMI credit
line still remained undisbursed. In order to avoid this problem under SMI II,
IAPMEI will submit to the Bank a few subprojects in excess of the credit line
amount for technical review and eventual financing by the Bank if funds become
available due to cancellations.

SMI Credit Line
3.10     Characteristics of Subproiects (Annex 3).  The Bank loan helped
finance 475 SfI investment subprojects, of which 113 were creation of new
companies. Very small subprojects (Type C - investment of less than
US$57,000) only represented 302 by number and less than 7% of the credit line
Amount, whereas more than 501 of manufacturing firms in Portugal have less
than 10 workers. The total estimated investment of about US$72 million
equivalent was well distributed among subsectors according to their relative
importance among SMIs in the country. The distribution was: 36% in
engineering, 14% in wood, cork, and furniture, 13% in shoes and leather, 102
in non-metallic minerals, 9% in chemicals and plastics, only 6% in textile and
garments, and the remaining 121 in food, paper and printing, and mining.
Although subprojects in textile and garments only accounted for 61 of the
investments, they were 171 by number and accounted for 241 of jobs created due
to the concentration of less capital intensive garment manufacturing firms
among SMIs eligible under the project. The average investment size was
US$151,000 and -aried from US$55,000 in textile and garments to US$224.000 in
shoes and leather . About 6,400 jobs were to be created at a moderate average
cost per job of US$11,200, similar to what had been expected. The cost per job
varied between a low US$2,900 in textile and garments and a high US$43,300 in
paper and printing.
3.11     Regional Distribution of Subprojects (Annex 4).  About 412 of the
subprojects were ;ocated in the North region (which includes Oporto), 322 in
the South (which includes Lisbon) and 271 in the Center, also very much in
line with the distribution of SMIs in the country. Subprojects in textile and
garments, and shoes and leather were concentrated in the North, whereas food,
chemicals and plastics, non-metallic minerals, and mining were concentrated in
the South. The other sectors, included engineering, were more evenly distri-
buted among the three regions. Larger subprojects tend to be concentrated in
the South, followed by the North, and the Center where subprojects tend to be
smaller on average.
3.12     Utilization of the Credit Line by the PBIs (Annex 5).  The distri-
bution of the credit line among PBIs was a reflection of their relative size
but also of their commitment to the SMI project. Of the 12 PBIs, the two most
active were Banco Portugues do Atlantico (136 subprojects and 22.4S of the
credit line) and Caixa Geral de Depositos (82 subprojects and 20.8 1 of the
credit line). Another four PBIs financed over 30 subprojects each and
accounted for a total of 162 subprojects and used 32.71 of the funds, and the
remaining six PBIs financed only 95 subprojects and used 24.11 of the funds.
PBIs were willing to take a large share of the financing of the investmernts.
Subloans amounted to about US$54 million or 761 of the investments, of which
US$38.2 million or 53% of the investments was refinanced by the Bank loan.
Despite the fact that the project allowed subloan maturities of up to 12 years,
actual maturities were rather short (between 4 and 7 years), and less than 30%
of the subloans had maturities over five years. Caixa Geral de Depositos and,
to a lesser extent, Banco de Fomento Nacional, being institutions that spe-
cialize in medium and long-term lending, granted subloans of longer maturities.



- 9 -
3.13     Imolementation of Subproiects (Annex 6).  Out of a sample of 164
subprojects analysed by IAPMEI, 39% had implementation delays of more than
three months, and 211 of more than six months. As it might be expected,
larger subprojects -tended to experience longer delays. Out of 100 subprojects
for which data on actual investment costs was available, 35 had cost overruns
over 151, and 24 over 251, mainly as a consequence of the implementation
delays referred above, domestic inflation and the devaluation of the Escudo.
It should be noted that PBIs rarely granted additional medium and long-term
loans to help finance these cost overruns, which has contributed, among other
factors, to the tight liquidity condition reported by many of the SMIs. Under
SMI II, IAPMEI has agreed to follow-up more closely the implementation of
subprojects.
3.14     Operational Performance of Subprojects (Annex 7).  Annual sales
generated by the subprojects financed by the Bank have been estimated at about
US$300 million of which about 281 were direct exports, just about the average
for the manufacturing sector in Portugal. Sales targets established in
appraisal reports were acnieved by 591 of the subprojects, and export targets
by 581, which reflects the effects of implementation delays, the difficult
economic situation in the country, and the optimism of the appraisals in some
cases. Jobs to be created were estimated more accurately.. Out of the 164
subprojects sampled, only 401 were reported without problems, another 401 were
facing temporary difficulties, and 202 had more serious problems, mainly
financial and in marketing their products. IAPMEI rerorted that it was
providing direct assistance to some of t4ese firms, mainly to solve technical,
management and financial problems.
3.15     Financial Performance of Subgrojects (Annex 7).  As a result of the
above mentioned operational problems, only 272 of the subprojects reported
profits before interest and taxes at about or higher rates than estimated in
the appraisal reports. Moreover, since medium and long-term loans carry
floating interest rates in Portugal and interest rates increased by 10-11% in
1978-83, only 161 of the companies achieved their net profit targets. Although
40% of the companies reported financial difficulties, only 22 firms, of which
13 were CGD clients, had rescheduled their subloans or were in arrears. The
concentration of arrears in CGD subloans appears to be due to the larger
percentage of new entrepreneurs among CGD clients, the lower quality of CGD's
subproject appraisals, and the more limited financial support provided by CGD
to its clients compared to the commercial banks in terms of short-term loans
to overcome temporary liquidity problems. On the other hand, and despite the
shorter maturities, most subloans by the commercial banks were being repaid
regularly, and their overall performance was better than the average portfolio
of the commercial banks, 161 of which was classified as doubtful accounts in
1983.
Industrial Estates Programs
3.16     The demand for the industrial estates was overestimated and there
were not enough incentives to locate in regions socially underdeveloped and
with poor economic infrastructures. In addition, numerous problems with



- 10 -
contractors, administrative procedures, staffing and funding caused delays
during the construction and made more difficult the promotion efforts by EPPI
and IAPME. Further problems were encountered regarding coordination with the
municipalities, preference of buying versus renting of some entrepreneurs, and
demand for buildings smaller than originally planned. Out of the six estates
planned, only the two estates in more developed areas had some success,
certainly encouraged by a policy of low rents. Construction of buildings was
slowed down as available buildings remained vacant. Of a total of 263,000
square meters of buildings planned in five estates (the sixth estate in Faro
was never started), only 90,000 or 34% was actually built as of September 1984,
of which more than 70% were in the estates of Braga and Guimaraes (Annexes 8
and 9). A total of 65 companies were located in the estates and employed
1,615 workers (Annex 10), compared to 15,800 jobs estimated at appraisal of
the SMI project. Of the US$9.5 million originally allocated from the Bank loan
to this component only US$3.17 million or 33% was actually disbursed, US$ 5.75
million was transferred to the SMI credit line at the request of the Govern-
ment, and US$0.57 million was cancelled.
3.17     EPPI's industrial estates program started in 1977 and it was entirely
funded from the Government's budget. Rents were heavily subsidized and no
provision was being made for adjusting rents with inflation. The Bank project
aimed at establishing EPPI's financial autonomy through a new financing plan
and rental policy. Under this plan, the Government would contribute annually
45% of EPPI's investment program. The remaining 55% would be raised through
domestic and foreign loans (including 20% from the Bank loan). Rentals on new
plots and buildings would be established at such levels a to generate an annual
net revenue of 7 percent of investment costs, on the assumption of a 90 percent
occupancy, and rents would be revised at least every three years in line with
domestic inflation. On that basis, EP?I was expected to have a positive
cash-flow after debt service in 1982, and to make profits over its entire
program in 1986. However, during implementation of the program these financial
projections appeared optimistic. Demand for the industrial estates was only
about one-third of wh- had been expected. In retrospect, it would appear that
the market studies which had been made were excessively optimistic. The Bank
experience itself in industrial estates at that time was not deep enough to
assess potential demand. When it noted this poor performance and also for
budgetary reasons, the Government reduced its contribution to the program to
only 34% of the funds required in 1979-84, and EPPI had to increase its
borrowings from CCG to cover the construction costs (Annex 11). To aggravate
EPPI's financial performance, domestic long-term lending rates increased from
22% in 1979 to 32.52 in 1983, and EPPI had to bear large foreign exzhange
losses on borrowings from the Bank. Thus in 1983 EPPI had a loss of 20% of
-quity, and receipts from rents only covered 28% of its interest obligations.
Also 15% of rent payments were in arrears. At this date, EPPI's financial
situation remains very precarious. The Government is considering a complete
restructuring of the industrial estates program, but no final decision has
been taken yet.

Technological Assistance Pro&ram
3.18     Purchasing of the equipment for LNETI laboratories suffered
substantial delays due to budgetary constraints resulting from the requirement
that expenditures to be financed by the Bank had to be formally included in the
Government's budget. By the end of 1983, the original closing date, only
US$0.5 million out of the US$1.8 million had been disbursed under this
component. Also US$200,000 was reallocated to cover the extension of the
technology policy study. Budgetary allocations were finally made in 1984-1985
and a total of US$1.54 million was disbursed (Annexes 12 and 13). There is
therefore, as yet, no tangible contribution from this component, although
benefits may be expected during the coming years. Also due to the budgetary
allocation requirement, the Us$50,000 for consultants and training abroad
remained unused and was cancelled.
Export Promotion Program
3.19     After the delays of loan effectiveness and the Government changes at
the beginning of 1980, the particular activities for export promotion to be
financed by this component lost government support. The FFE was shifted from
the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism to the Ministry of Industry in 1981. It
was then decided, after a preliminary analysis, that the review of the
structure of export incentives was not a priority, and that the effort should
concentrate on the simplification of administrative procedures. The program
supported by the project was abandoned and its funding of US$0.24 million was
reallocated to the credit line component.
Studies
3.20     The textile sector study was finalized before the Bank loan became
effective. The funds were reallocated for a study of the pulp and paper sector
which was carried out by FAO and finalized by December 1983. The technology
policy study was successfully carried out by MIT. It was extended in scope
and US$200,000 were transferred from the LNETI component to cover part of the
additional costs.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL IMPACT
Participating Banking Institutions
4.01     All nine commercial banks and three specialized financial institutions
participated in the SMI project, although in varying degrees (see para 3.12).
Only since 1977 commercial banks had reached a significant level of medium-
and long-term lending. While some commercial banks in Portugal still have
limited project appraisal capacity, there was considerable development in this
field under the first SMI project of the Bank, and it has been continued under



- 12 -
the ascond SMI project currently under way. By 1982, coimuercial banksi had a
total of moze than 200 professional staff, mainly economists and financial
analysts, redponsible for the appraisal of medium and long-term loans in their
Lisbon and Oporto offices. Appraisal reports are generally of good quality,
mainly focused on the financial evaluation of projects and with lesser emphasis
on techtical, marketing and management aspects. Except for two of the largest
comercial banks, BFN, and CGD, the number of engineers available for appraisal
is limited and banks rely on information provided by the promoters, equipment
suppliers, IAPMEI or independent consultants. The review of all appraisal
reports by IAPMEI has, to some extent, covered these deficiencies. Moreover,
because of increasing arrears from SMlo in 1983-84, PB1s, and particularly CGD,
are currontly more cautious in evaluating investment proposals, specially in
the case of new entrepreneurs. Finally, the Bank project played a role in
reinforcin* the interest of the financial intermediaries in the SMI sector, and
in attracting additional foreign sources of financing to the 8MI sector in the
last five years (see para 3.07).
The Role of IAPMEI
4.02     Since its creation in 1975, IAPMEI has made significant progress
towards designing and implementing programs of assistance to the SMI segment
of the manufocturing sector; in addition, IAPMEI has played a very effective
role in the pr)uotion and coordination of the first SMI project of the Bank,
and its follow-up SMI-Il. Initially involved primarily in SMI financial rescue
operations, IAPMEI has shifted its emphasis over the years towards more funda-
mental long-term support of existing enterprises and promotion of new firms
(e.g., sectoral studies, analysis of incentives, technology and regional
development), and makes more use of outside consultants for ad-hoc inter-
ventions in SMIs. Also collective actions like the development of technical
institutes, subcontracting centers, and organization of training seminars have
enable IAPMEI to disseminate technical assistance to a large'.r number of SMIs
in a more cost effective manner. In order to better respoa. to the needs of
SMIs throughout the country, IAPMEI has decentralized some o. its functions to
the 2 delegations and 8 regional offices. A new regional office in Braga was
also opened during the time of the first SMI project. The number of IAPMEI's
staff increased from 185 to almost 250 during 1978-79, but since then it has
declined to 233, of which 190 professionals, at end-1985.
4.03     An important limitation which has hindered IAPMEI's effectiveness and
performance has been the restriction imposed by IAPMEI's statutes which prevent
recruitment of staff from outside the public sector and impose on them the low
salary scales of civil servants. As a consequence, IAPMEI has been unable to
retain some of its most valuable staff and to recruit new staff with relevant
experience. New statutes were planned for IAPMEI during preparation of the
SMI project. However, after more than a year of discussions (see para 3.04),
the Government declined to make the required changes, and this is still a real
constraint on IAPMEI . Another limitatioi., partly also related to the previous
one, refers to the general reluctance of SMI entrepreneurs to receive outside
assistance, either from IAPMEI or independent consultants. Moreover, financial
institutions have not so far exploited their leverage to ensure that technical



- 13 -
asistance is actually sought and carried out when deemed necessary. Under
the second SNI project of the Bank approved in 1983, IAPMEI agreed to use more
outside consultants to complement its own staff resources, and IAPMI and the
PBIe also agreed tQ pay particular attention to the technical assistance needs
of enteorprises during appraisal of subprojects.
4.04     As regards IAPMEI's performance on implementation of the SMI project,
it has been generally satisfactory. Because of the strong motivation and
effort of IAPMEI's management, the promoticn and utilization of the credit
line were successfully achieved. The quality of IAPMEI's reviews of appraisal
reports was uneven, particularly when financing had already been approved by
the PBil and implnomnt.aion was even underway. IAPMEI had also to compromise
between promoting a Cast utilisation of the SMI credit line and ensuring the
quality of t;e appraisal reports. Monitoring and follow-up of subproject
implementation, including follow-up of the export performance of subprojects,
was weak, although it has been strengthened under the second SMI project.
Other activities assigned to IAPMEI under the project were related to the
promotion of export-oriented subprojects, the promotion of the industrial
estates, the promotion of collaborations between small and large enterprises,
and the improvement of the links between SMIs and LNETI. Various activities
were carried out with these purposes, like the creation of three subcontracting
centers in collaboration with the professional associations, but actual results
have been very limited. In 1985 IAPMEI started to administer a new program of
incentives to SMIs through interest-free loans; the Bank expressed its concern
to IAPMEI and the Government that, under current staff constraints, this new
activity could jeopardize IAPMEI's essential function of technical assistance
to SMIs; more recently, the Government has decided to reconsider the design
and administration of the program.
V. CONCLUSIONS
5.01     The project was very successful in its main objective concerning  the
modernization and expansion of ihe SMI sector in Portugal. It helped finance
investments of about US$72 million equivalent in 475 projects, about 40% more
than planned in real terms, and contributed to the creation of about 6,400
jobs at a moderate cost per job of $11,200. The extensive networks of CGD and
the commercial banks proved to be an effective way of reaching the SMIs, but
very small companies (less than 10 workers) did not benefit commensurately
from this project. Maturities (and grace periods) of subloans granted by the
commercial banks were rather short (mostly up to 5 years), and commercial banks
were more reluctant to extend loans to new entrepreneurs because of tre
greater risk combined with their inability to charge an interest rate premium.
IAPMEI played an important role in assisting those entrepreneurs chroughout
its promotion, technical assistance and guarantees programs. The project also
played a catalytic role in attracting funds from the EEC, EIB and KfW to the
SMI sector. Disbursement under the project were adversely affected by the
devaluation of the Escudo against the US dollar, and also by processing delays.
The latter has been corrected under the second SMI project.



- 14 -
5.02     The performance of the subprojects financed by the Bank was generally
satisfactory considering the difficult economic conditions during the period.
The export performance of subprojects was just about the average for the
manufacturing sector overall, which is lower than what had been expected. Many
of the subprojects reported financial problems mainly caused by the combination
ot cost overruns due to implementation delays and the effects of inflation,
high interest rates, and short maturities and grace periods of the subloans.
However, few companies were in arrears in repaying the subloans, which appears
to indicate that they were being refinanced by short-term credit. Also few
companies reported serious technical, marketing and management problems, and
these were concentrated among new ventures. It appears that the process of
appraisal of subprojects contributed to a better selection and design of
investments. Improvements are still needed, particularly regarding more
realistic estimates of subproject costs and time required to reach the full
production stage, and more attention to management aspects of new enterprises.
5.03     The project also made an important contribution to the development of
the appraisal capabilities of the commercial banks, especially those which had
a greater participation in the project, and to the instiLutional strengthening
of IAPMEI. Commercial banks, however, should be more sensitive to the need to
provide for adequate physical and price contingencies ir the project costs
estimates, and longer time spans for the investments to reRch the full
productior stage. This should translate ir longer and more adequate
maturities and grace periods on investment loans. IAPMEI also played an
effe.tive role in the promotion and coordination of the SMI project, and it
made significant progress towards designing and implementing programs of
assistance to SMIs. However, given the complexity of the project IAPMEI was
spread too thinly. Moreover, its overall effectiveness is still curtailed by
its difficulties in recruiting and retaining higher quality staff under its
current personnel policies as a government agency. Some oorrective actions
were taken under the second SMI project, and IAPMEI has agreed to make more
use of outside consultants for the more specialized and time consuming
technical assistance actions, and to strengthen monitoring of subproject
implementation.
5.04     Bringing industrial enterprises to the less developed regions of the
interior proved to be a much more difficult task than had been envisaged at
appraisal. Moreover, this component of the project was not sufficiently
prepared in terms of the analysis of demand, design of the program, and
incentives offered to firms in the industrial estates. EPPI was also a new
institution wnich had to face unexpected proolems of sta'fing, funding,
administrative procedures, problems with contractors, and lack of collaboration
of some municipalities. Demand w1is greatly overestimated by EPPI. but also
endorsed by 1APMEI and the Bank. As a consequence, only 34% of buildings
planned were actually built, of which 702 in two of the five indust?:ial
estates, and jobs created were less thAn 10% of those planned. The low
occupancy of the estates, added to low equity contributions, high interest
rates and a policy of low rents at the beginning of the program, has led to
EPPI being in a very weak financial situation.

5.05     Purchasing of equipment of LNETI laboratories was substantially
delayed by budgetary constraints and their effects on LNETI's budget. Thus
benefits way only be expected in future years.  Budgetary constraints also
affected the smell.component for consultant services and training abroad which
remined unused. The program for export promotion was reviewed and priorities
were changed during the project, causing this component to be abandoned.
finally, two studies were successfully carried out under the project.
5.06     The final results of the project have been mixed.  While the project
was essentially successful in meeting its objectives for the development of
SZIs, including the institutional strengthening of IAPHEI and the participating
financiAl institutions, it fell considerably short of meeting its objectives
of development of industrial estates in lese develcped regions and export
promotion. Thus in retrospect, it appears that the pioject was too complex in
design and too ambitious in scope for the first operation of this type in the
country. The project involved a larger number of components and interrelated
activities, and the implementing agencies were weak or inexperienced. Project
implementation was delayed by difficulties in meeting the numerous conditions
of effectiveness in a timely manner, and was also adversely affected by the
difficult and changing political and economic conditions in Portugal. Bank
supervision vas intense, but unable to cover effectively the broad range of
activities and agencies involved. The project also proved not to be an
adequate instrument for influe.scing broader issues on industrial policies and
investment incentives.
