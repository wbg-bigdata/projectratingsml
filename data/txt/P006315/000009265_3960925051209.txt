PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BUIL
ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEM COORDINATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1939-BR)
Preface
Thig is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Electric Power
System Coordination Project, for which Loan 1939-BR (US$54.0 million% was
approved on December 23, 1980. The borrower and major beneficiary was
Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, S.A. (ELETROBRAS), the public-sector
corporation which serves as holding company for the federal power utilities
and which performs sector-wide planning and financial functions. The lesser
beneficiary was the federal power utility serving the Northeastern region,
Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco (CHESF).
The project consisted of the first stage of a computerized
supervisory and control systerm, at the national level for interconnected power
operations (SINSC). ELETROBRAS and CHESF completed their project components
in 1989 and 1991, respectively, between five and seven years late.
The Bank declared the loan agreement to be effective on August 5,
1981. The actual closing date of the loan was December 31, 1989, four years
after the original closing date. The last disbursement was on May 18, 1990.
Parts I and III of the PCR were prepared by the Energy anA Industry
Operations Division, Country Department I (Brazil, Venezuela, and Peru). These
Parts were based on, inter alia: (i) final project reports prepared by ELETROBRAS
_..a CHESF; (ii) Bank sources, including the Loan, Project, and Guarantee
Agreements, the SAR and President's Report, supervision reports, internal Bank
memoranda, and Bank-beneficiary correspondence; and (iii) interviews with Bank
and beneficiary staff. Part II of the PCR was prepared by the Borrower.
Preparation of the PRC was started in March 1991. A mission to gather
information on this project returned from Brazil in May 1991. The beneficiaries
reviewed a draft of the PCR and their comments have been taken into account in
this report.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEM COORDINATION PROJECT
(LOAN 19,Z9-BR)
Evaluation Summary
Proiect Description. Loan 1939-BR (US$54.0 million) helped
Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, S.A. (ELETROBRAS), a holding company for
federal power utilities, and its subsidlary, Comphania Hidro Eletrica do Sao
Francisco (CHESF), to finance the first stage of a computerized supervision
and control system at the national level for interconnected power operations
(SINSC). The project consisted of: the supervisory and control systems of
ELETROBRAS and CHESF (Part A); their resrective telecommunications links (Part
B); and tariff studies and a sector training program (Part C) (paras. 4.04-
.06). In due course, some ten major power utilities will be part of SINSC.
Actual and Forecast Cost. Actual and expected expenditures through
1991 amounted to US$114.2 million as compared the appraisal forecast of
US$140.2 million. The lower cost was primarily due to reduced expenditures on
Part B (telecommunications). In the case of ELETROBRAS, reduced expenditures
were due to improvements in the public telecommunications networks, thereby
making such expenditures redundant. In the case of CHESF, reduced
expenditures were due to financial constraint (para. 5.05).
Proiect Issues: Delayed Imol2mentation. ELETROBRAS completed its
component in 1989, five years late (para. 5.06); CHESF completed its component
in 1991, seven years late (para. 5.13). Delays began as a result of late loan
approval, late effectiveness, and the unofficial suspension of disbursement on
all power loans to Brazil in the fall of 1981 (paras. 4.12; and 5.01-.02); and
they continued due to long disagreements between the beneficiaries and their
respective consultant/suppliers as to the work to be done -- disagreements
which had *heir origin at appraisal in an understandable lack of appreciation
on the part of staffs of ELETP.OBRAS and CHESF as to the: (i) complexity
related to the acquisition and development of "hardware" and "software"; and
(ii) impact of continuous technological change on the project. Also
unappreciated at appraisal was the inappropriateness of ICB for this project
(paras. 5.09 & 5.14; 10.02-.04). Like ELETROBRAS and CHESF, the Bank did not
foresee the complexity related to the acquisition and development of
"hardware" and "software", the impact of technological change on the project,
or the inappropriateness of ICB.
The project, because of its dependence on specially designed
technology and specially developed computer programs, more nearly resembled
the intellectual product which one would seek from a consultant than it
resembled what one would seek from a supplier or a contractor (civil works,
equipment, etc.). Given the nature of the project and the fact of
technological change, the process of selecting among bidding consultant/
suppliers through ICS was inappropriate -- that is, the consultant/supplier



- iii -
was selected, the "Work Statement" agreed, and the contract, including a fixed
price, signed, exen though the work to be done was subject to revision due to
technological change. This approach, especially the fixed price, biased the
beneficiaries and consultant/suppliers in different directions -- the
consultant/supplier toward fulfilling his obliga ion at the contract price,
even if it meant not using the mr"st technologically advanced computers and
"software"; and the beneficiaries toward obtaining the most advanced system,
the cost to the consultant/supplier notwithstanding. In these circumstances,
disagreement, delay, and contract revision came to characterize project
implementation.
That the staffs of t&e Bank, ELETROBRAS, and CHESF should have not
appreciated at appraisal the complexity related to acquisition and development
of "software" and "hardware" or anticipated the impact of continuous
technological change on the work to be done and the diverging interests of the
beneficiaries and consultant/suppliers was (and is) understandable, as none of
these entities was (or is) in the business of financing and carrying out
projects requiring familiarity twith s';ch phenomena (para. 10.02).
Although ELETROBRAS recognized that it had no previous experience
in utilizing a system such as SINSC, it disagreed with the judgement on its
not appreciating at appraisal the complexities of implementation: "..we wish
to note that neither ELETROBRAS nor CHESF lacked a realistic concept of what
to expect in the implementation of their projects..." (Part II, Section II,
page 30). Also, ELETROBRAS felt that ICB was appropriate for this projects
"...it is our view that there were many positive aspects to tne process
carried out in conjunction with ICB, and that some flexibility could be
introduced in dea±ing with the specific aspects of acquisition..." (Part I;,
Section III, page 30).
Sector Issues: Financial Performance and Reaulatorv Reaime. As a
reflection of the larger problems of sector financial constraint, the
financial per2ormances of ELETROBRAS and CHESF were poor during the perLid
1980-1989; and their respective capacities to finance investment through
internal cash generation declined dramatically (paras. 9.10-.15). To
interpret adequately the finances of ELETROBRAS and CHESF, one must, given
legal structure of the sector, analyze sector finances, Government policies
toward the sector -- as such policies underlie the financial performance of
the sector, ELETROBRAS, and CHESF -- and the regulatory regime through which
those policies are established.
The regulatory regime prevailing after appraisal (1979) reduced the
authority ofs (i) the Departamento National de Aquas e Energia Eletrica
(DNAEE), a regulatory body which approved tariff levels and individual
projects; and (ii) ELETROBRAS which carried out sector-wide planning
functions, in favor of Government planning agencies which reviewed tariff
decisions and planned investment expenditure levels for consistency with
macroeconomic goals. Final decisions were taken by a meeting of ministers.
The Bank considered this regulatory regime to be an extension of
past trends -- that is, in the late 1970s, the Government had successfully
pressured DNAEE to interpret power tariff legislation in a manner which war



- iv -
consistent with its macroeconomic goals.  This pressure had resulted in
reduced tariffs and revenues for the sector. The review of decisions and
plans of DNAEE and ELETROBRAS by planning groups was expected to stimulate
improved dialogue between regulators and regulated with at least the
possibility of improved communications and speedier decisions. Accordingly,
the Bank accepted the new regime; and sought and obtained Government agreement
on a series of financial rehabilitation programs involving tariff increases
and other measures (paras. 2.05-.11).
In 1981, the Government agreed with the Bank on a plan to
rehabilitate sector finances through tariff increases. This plan (and its
successors) superseded the tariff understandings agreed in connection -' .
Loan 1939-BR.  The Government did not fully implement this plan in 196.   (The
sector has not covered its debt service with internal cash generation since
l982.) In 1983 and 1986, the Government agreed with the Bank on plans to
rehabilitate sector finances through tariff increases and other means. The
Bank supported the sector financial rehabilitate plan of 1986 with the Power
Sector Loan (2720-BR; US$500 million); and ChESF was one of the beneficiaries
of this loan.
None of these plans provided more than temporary relief to the
deteriorated state of sector finances because the Government, in the interest
of fighting inflation, allowed tariff levels to decline. In these
circumstances, over the decade of the 1980s, borrowing and then equity
contributions displaced internal cash generation as the primary source of
sector investment financing (para. 9.02-.09).
During the years 1987-1989, the Bank and the Government earnestly
sought to negotiate a second sector adjustment loan and a loan promoting
environmental reform and conservation policies. Deteriorating macroeconomic
conditions and the choice by the Government of other strategic objectives
frustrated these efforts. In 1990, the Bank conditioned effectiveness for a
new sector investment loan (3227-BR; US$385 million) to a considerable tariff
increase; but since loan approval, the real level of tariffs has declined due
to the failure of the Government to raise tariffs enough to keep up with
inflation. The Government proposes to raise tariffs gradually to the level
required for effectiveness, but only by December 1992. In these
circumstances, the loan agreement remains unsigned and its future is
uncertain.
Lessons to be Learned. Concerning the project, it is clear that
selecting the consultant/supplier through ICB was not appropriate, that it
promoted disagreement and delay. If the Bank is again faced with the
opportunity to finance such a project, it should not insist on the use of ICB.
Instead, the Bank should permit selection on a basis more nearly resembling
the guidelines for selecting consultants, i.e., use of a "short list",
agreement on "hardware", "software", and a "Work Statement" to define the
scope of the work, and then negotiation of a contract price based on the
agreements as to equipment and scope of the work. In the event that
technological change later calls into question these agreements -- contract

2. Sector Background
2.01        Bank Lending.  The Bank has a long history of lending to the Brasil
power sector, including Loan 1939-BR (US$54 million, 1980), the subject of this
report, which helped to finance the first stage of a computerized supervision and
control system at the national level (SINSC) of interconnected power operations.
Since 1949, the Bank has made 42 power loans amounting to about US$4.1 billion,
including: (i) nine loans to Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, S.A. (ELETROBRAS --
para. 2.05) for almost US$2.0 billion (Part III, Table la); and (ii) four loans
amounting to about US$231.2 million to benefit Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao
rrancisco (CHESF), the ELETROBRAS operating subsidiary responsible for generation
and transmission in the Northeastern region. (Part III, Table lb).
2.02        Through relending agreements, almost all of the proceeds of the loans
to ELETROBRAS were used to help finance the projects of state and federal power
utilities -- hydroelectric power stations (before the mid-1970s) and trans-
mission/distribution works (after the mid-1970s). Loan 1939-BR was an exception,
as ELETROBRAS was the major beneficiary of this loan and CHESF was the lesser
beneficiary (see para. 4.06).
2.03        In 1986, the Bank providee sector adjustment financing to promote
financial rehabilitation, conservation, and environmental/social safeguards.
During the next three years (1987-9), the Bank and the Government, due to
macroeconomic, tariff, and other factors, failed to agree on the terms of a
second sector adjustment loan or a loan promoting environmental reform and
conservation.   In June 1990, after the Government implemented major tariff
increases, the Executive Directors (EDs) of the Bank approved a new investment
loan to the power sector in connection with a transmission and conservation
project.
2.04        Organizatiop. The sector consists primarily of a relatively compact
group of state- and federally-owned utilities with primary responsibilities for,
respectively, distribution and generation/transmission. The authority of the
federal Government to supervise sector decision-makLng, especially with respect
to levels for tariff a, borrowing, and investment expenditure, is paramount. Xow-



2
ever, since 1987, in circumetances of growing criticism by state governments of
its sector regulatory policies, the federal Government has not exercised its
authority as firmly and effectively as before, especially with respect to
enforcing collections for the sector ravenue-sharing mechanism (para. 9.07).
2.05        Reoulation and Plannina. Prior to appraieal (1979), the Government
supervised the sector through two agencies under the jurisdiction of the Ministry
of Mines and Energyt Departamento Nacional de Aquas e Energia Eletrica (DNAEE),
a regulatory body which approved, inter _ali, tariff levels and projects of
particular companies; and ELETROBRAS, a mixed-economy corporation created by the
Government to perform holding-company functions for federally-owned power
companies and to carry out sector-wide financial functions and sector-wide
planning based on least-cost criteria (para. 2.01).  These were not _%-dependent
agencies; they were part of the Government. The decisions of DNAEE were expected
to be consistent with the objectives and policies of the Administration. The
same was true with r-spect to ELETROBRAS.
2.06        The power tariff legislation applied by DNAEE provided for: (i)
nationally uniform tariffs set at levels to earn returns of 10-12% on
"remunerable investment" (or rate base); (ii) the transfer of financial reeources
from the stronger utilities to the weaker utilities until the weaker utilities
earned 10% on their rate bases; and (iii) the addition of revenue shortfalls to
the rate base (Compensation Account) for recovery through future tariff
increases. The revenue covenants of Bank loan agreements relied on power tariff
legislation.
2.07        Before 1976, DNAEE applied this legislation in a manner enabling the
sector to earn the legal return (10%) on its rate base and finance a considerable
share of its investment expenditures from internal resources. In the opinion of
the Bank, during the first half of the 1970s, the application of this legislation
produced a financial environment satisfactory for sector development. In like
manner, the Bank felt that the planning and financial operations of ELETROBRAS
contributed to sector development.
2.08        In the  latter  1970s,  the  level of sector revenues began to
deteriorate because DNAEE did not authorize adequate tariff increases. It took
a new approach to the application of power tariff legislation by: (i) redefining
"remunerable investment" in a way which effectively lowered the rate base; (ii)
adopting a methodology for asset revaluation which failed to maintain the value
of the rate base in circumstances of high, rising inflation; (iii) disapproving
some utility operating expense u: and (iv) making more liberal use of the
Compensation Account (para. 2.06).  Underlying this new approach was Government
pressure on DNAEE to reduce electricity tariffs in real terms to contain
inflationary expectations. The Bank maintained an active dialogue with DNAEE on
the bases for its decisions; but it was understood that in the final analysis the
rulings of DNAEE reflected Government policy.
2.09        The planning and regulatory regime began to change in 1979 when the
Government, to align sector policies more closely with its larger macroeconomic
strategy, required the review of the planning agency, Secretaria Especial de
Abastecimento e Precos (SEAP) for tariff increases authorized by DNAEE. Final
approval was taken at a meeting of ministers. This limitation of the authority
of DNAEE to set tariffs was followed by a limitation of the authority of
ELETROBRAS to undertake sector planning. In 1980, the Government required review



3
by the Seocretaria de Controls do Empresaw Eutatais/ Secretaria do Planejamento
(SEST/SEPLAN) for levels of investment expenditures by state- and Government-
owned enterprises, J -luding power utilities. Again, final approval was taken
at a meeting of mir   era.
2.10        The Bank interpreted the new regime am being a continuatton of past
regulatory trends.   While recognizing that the new regime lacked adequate
provision for the long-term view, the Bank accepted, even welcomed, the new
regime which had the potential of increasing dialogue between the utilities,
ELETROBRAS, DNAEE, and the planning agencies.
2.11        Given the unsatisfactory regulatory performance of DNAZE in the late
1970s, the Bank did not seek a reversal of the limitation on the autonomy and
authority of DNAEE.   Instead,  believing that the new regime offered the
possiblilty of dealing dlrectly with those who made decisions, the Bank earnestly
sought and obtained Governmen'-_ agreement to a series of tariff-increase and other
programs which aimed at the financial restoration of the sector. As shown later
(paras. 9.02-.09), during project lmplementation (1981-1991), the Government did
not fully implement these programs; and the sector policies instituted under the
new regulatory regime seriously undermlned the financial health of the sector.
2.12        DeveloMent OblectLves.  In order to reduce dependence on imported
petroleum and to improve the national balance-of-payment situation, the
Government, following the oll crieis (1974), adopted a national energy policy
whlch emphaeLz,.d maximum exploitation of local primary sources, especially hydro.
As some 92,000 NW of hydro-power potential had been identified, thLs policy
accorded well with the resources of the country; but as the implementation of
this policy required the raising of massive amounts of capital -- an increasingly
difficult task -- it became even more important to maximize the efficiency of
power use by interconnecting and coordinating the operation of generation and
transmlssion facilities in the Southern and Southeastern regions. On a practical
baeis, this step involveds (i) constructing and reinforcing lnterregional
transmission links; and (ii) coordinating the interregional operation and use of
generation plants and transmieeion facilities.
2.13        Physical and operational Characterlitice.   In 1968, major power
utilities of the Southeast, in recognition of the beneflts that could be derived
from coordination, voluntarily formed a committee to carry out studies and
establish policies for interconnected operations. It was the responsibility of
thie committee to fashion solutions suitable to the physical and operational
characteristice of the sector -- that is, the sharing of hydro resources by
different utilities through the ownership and operation of power plants in
cascade on the same river. In such circumstances, none of the utilities could
operate its high-voltage transmiseion llnes or adequately monitor and analyze its
system without receiving data on the operations of other utilities.
2.14        In 1974, the Government established reglonal Grupos Coordinadores
para Operacao Interligada (GCOIs) with enhanced legal powers to coordinate system
operations, including the operations of the individual power plant. Headed by
ELETROBRAS, the GCOIs worked toward integrating the interconnected operatlons of
the systems of the South and the Southeast. CHESF became a member of the GCOI
for the Southeast because of the mixed ownership of major reservoirs in cascade
on the Sao Francisco River. One reservoir served the Southeastern system, the
other served the Northeastern power system; but because they were located on the



4
same river, the power systems of the Southeastern and Northeastern regions were
functionally linked.
2.15        By the late 1970s, ELETROBRAS/GCOI had developed annual and monthly
interconnected operation plans and dispatch schedules, established operating
criteria, and performed reviews of system performance. To implement these plans,
the interconnected networks relLed upon telephone directed operator intervention,
as they lacked a computerized supervision and control system at the national
level. Given that the planned expansion of the sector would be on a basis of
mixed ownership and operations, ELETROBRAS/GCOI needed a level of capability for
monitoring, supervising, and processing information far beyond what then existed.
Remote monitoring of the power plantsp substations, and transmission lines at
most company, regional, and national levels was non-existent. To remedy this
situation, ELETROBRAS proposed creating SINSC (para. 2.02); and the project would
be the first stage of SINSC.
3. SINSC - Elements. etc.
3.01        Elements.  In late 1978, with the help of foreign consultants, whose
services were fundea by Loan 1343-BR, ELETROBRAS prepared the program for SINSC;
and began sending documentation to the Bank.  As defined at appraisal, the
central elements of SINSC would consist oft (i) a Real-Time Supervision System
(RTSS) to be located at a national Supervision and Coordination Center (CSC) in
Brasilia, which ELETROBRAS would operate; (Li) Data Acquisition and Control
Systems (DACSs), which major power utilities1 would operate at their respective
Systems Operations Centers (COSs); and (iii) the telecommunication systems
(mainly microwave) linking (i) and (ii).
3.02        The RTSS would consist of computers, peripheral equipment (consoles,
video displays), computer programs, i.e., "software", and interface equipment
between the computers and the telecommunications equipment.  The DACSs would
consist of computer-based master stations, remote terminal units, peripherals and
supporting communication networks necessary for the COSs to control their areas
of operation within the interconnected power system. The computer at the CSC
would communicate with each of the computers at the COBs through the
communication systems. These systems would consist of high quality voice grade
channels.
3.03        Functions.  As foreseen by the consultants and ELETROBRAS, the CSC
would be at the top level of an hierarchical system; and its functions would
include production scheduling and coordination, supervision of the main
interconnected network, interchange accounting and operations analysis and
reporting. At the next level would be the COS8, where the DACs would perform
digital automatic generation control, supervisory control of the transmission
The major power utilities would be the five operating subsidfaries of ELETROBRAS and the power companies
of the states of Ninas Gerais, Sao Paulo, and Rio Grande do Sul. The five operating companies of ELETROBRAS
are: CHESF, Centrais Etetricas Fumes, SA (FURNAS), Centrafs Etetricas do Norte do Brasl, SA (ELETRONORTE),
Centrais Etetricas do Sut do Brast, SA tELETROSUL), and Light Servicos de ELetricidade, SA (LIGHT). The state
power conpanies are: Comparihia Energetica de Ninas Gerais (CENIG), Companhia Energetica do Sao Pauto (CESP),
Etetricidade de Sao Pauto (ELETROPAULO), Compunhia Paranaenee de Energia (COPEL), and Compania Estadual de
Energia Eletrica tCEEE).

system, data acquisitLon, energy management (such as production schedullng, load
shedding, voltage control), and network analyaLs. The computer at the lndlvidual
COS would process, transmlt, and receLve data from the C8C computer. At the
bottom level would be the power plants and substatLons whlch would be monltored
and controlled from the COS. There would be no dlrect communLcatLons between
the CSC computer and the power plants and substatLons.
3.04        Obiective.  The central objectLve of SINSC and of the project, as
foreseen at the plannlng stage, would be to improve sector management and to
reduce and/or postpone lnvestments for future generatlng plants and tranamissLon
lines by providing facilltles to: (a) malntaln and lmprove the rellabillty of
electricity supply wlth lower generatlon and transmLssion capaclty reserve
margins; (b) increase the rational and coordlnated use of exlstlng facilities;
(c) reestabllsh servLce faster than currently possible after an emergency
interruption; (d) ensure full use of hydroelectrlc energy output from ItaLpu; (e)
derive power and energy beneflts from lncreased head water levels at all plants
through water management coordlnation and reduced fuel use; (f) provlde data to
enhance system planning; and (g) provide "real-time" data and lnformatlon to the
Data Bank of ELETROBRAS for operatlon plannlng purposes and also to COBs for
thelr own analysis of securlty of system operatlons on the basLi of the operating
conditions of the nelghborlng systems. The expected completlon dates for the
project and SINSC were, respectively, June 30, 1985 and June 30, 1986.
4. Loan Processina:
4.01        Chronoloav. From the second half of 1978, when ELETROBRAS identifled
the project, through April-May 1980, when the Bank, ELUTROBRAS, CHESF, and the
Government completed negotlatlons, all partles to the project collaborated
efficiently in preparlng, appraLsing, and processing the project and negotiating
the loan. Thereafter, unantiLcpated procurement issues delayed the date for
presenting the loan to the EDs untI the thlrd week of December 1980.
4.02        The Bank dLspatched a preparation misLson Ln May 1979, an appraLeal
mission in September-October 1979, and a post-appraLeal mLssion in December 1979
(Part III, Table 2). These mlsslons concentrated on: (i) njoect lssues such as
participation by other power companles ln 8INSC, the scope of the project, its
content, impact, timlng, cost, justification, related tralnlng needs, and pro-
procurement, (paras. 4.08-.11); and (iL) uector isgueu, especially the low level
of sector tarLffs and the continulng non-compliance by Bank borrowers with
respect to their respectlve revenue covenants (whLch were based on Brazllian
tarlff law) (paras. 4.07-. 10). In addition to these project and sector Lisues,
the post-appraLsal mlssion examLned the flnanclal projections of ELETROBRAB and
CHESF and the capacity of local manufacturers to supply part of the SupervLsory
Control and Data AcquisLtLon (SCADA) equLpment.
4.03        Proiect Issue:t BINSC PartlciLants. Concerning the important issue
of which other power companies besLdes CHEUB would join 8INSC and under what
arrangements, the SAR reported: "...COPRL's (C0OS is already in operatlon... ; the
ELETRONORTE system ....and the CERI  system... wlll incorporate provislons for
lntegratlon into SINSC. The ...specifLcatLons for the COSB of FURNAS, BLETROSUL,
CESP, CEEE, and ITAIPU are still in the process of study ...." The Bank was
satisfied with these agreements. ULETROBRAS agreed to take all action necessary
to ensure that SIN8C would be completed ln accordance wlth sound engineering,
financial, and public utility practlee.

4.04        Pro0ect Issues: SCORe & Cost.  The scope, content and cost of the
project underwent considerable change between appraisal (September-October 1979)
and Board approval (December 1980). For example, Bank staff appraised a project
with a cost of US$304.5 million, including a foreign-currency cost of US$76.9
million; and a scope and content initially defined as consisting of the: (i) RTSS
located at CSC facility at Brasilia and the DACSs located at the COSs of LIGHT
and CHESF (Part A); and (ii) telecommunication links and interfaces to the COSS
of LIGHT and CHESF (Part B) (para. 3.01). Part A also included training programs
on the installation, operation, and maintenance of related equipment and
facilities.   With respect to Part B, because the Government indicated its
intention to reserve bidding for the telecommunications equipment to local
manufacturers, Bank financing would be limited to items procured under
international competitive bidding (ICB), or US$70.0 million.
4.05        From this initial definition, both before and after negotiations
(April-May, 1980), the Bank and local authorities agreed on considerable changes
(mainly reductions) to the project. The changes consisted of: (i) reducing the
proposed CHESF telecommunications system to only that part which would directly
benefit the project; (ii) eliminating the works planned for LIGHT; and (iii)
adding Part C, consisting of sector training (3,060 man-months in Brazil and 525
man-months abroad) and tariff studies (see Annex 1 for further details on project
changes).
4.06        Reflecting the above changes and including physical and price
contingencies, the expected cost of the project was US$140.2 million with a
foreign-cost component of US$58.2 million, including US$4.2 million of foreign-
currency costs for telecommunications equipment (Part B). The Bank loan would
amount to US$54.0 million -- US$32.0 million to benefit ELETROBRAS and US$22.0
million to benefit CHESF; would cover all but a fraction (US$0.1 million) of the
foreign-currency costs of Parts A (US$49.1 million) and C (US$5.0 million); and
would be disbursed against contracts awarded under ICB.  It would not cover
financing costs (interest charged to construction) and foreign-currency costs
related to the telecommunications component (Part B), as bidding for this
equipment would be reserved to local manufacturers. The balance of financing,
US$86.2 million, would be provided as follows: ELETROBRAS, US$36.4 million, ; and
CHESF, US$49.7 million.
4.07        Proiect Issues: Nature of the Proiect.  Bank files do not indicate
an appreciation by the Bank and beneficiaries of the: (i) real nature of the
project, which is a product of intellect -- or what one would seek from a
consultant; (ii) complexities of acquiring and developing "hardware" and "soft-
ware"; and (iii) effect of technological change, which would cause the
beneficiaries and consultant/suppliers to react differently, especially as con-
ditioned by Bank procurement guidelines (see para. 5.09). This is understand-
able, as the Bank and the beneficiaries were not in the business of financing and
implementing "high-tech" projects requiring familiarity with such phenomena.
4.08        Sector Issues: Tariff Levels and Revenue Covenants.  For several
years prior to appraisal (1979), in connection with sector tariff and revenue
levels, the Bank had been concerned about the: (i) methodology of revaluation
which did not maintain asset values in circumstances of high, rising inflation;
and (ii) low level of sector tariffs which did not permit Bank borrowers to
generate revenues sufficient to earn the legal rates of return of 10-12% on
remunerable assets (para. 2.08).   The Government justified the low level of



7
tariffs, which were politically popular, as part of its effort to combat
inflation; and assured the Bank that past and current revenue shortfalls (below
the legal rate of return) would be recovered through future tariff increases.
The law permitted the incorporation of such shortfalls into the rate bases of the
operating companies (para. 2.06).
4.09        The appraisal mission recommended the conditioning of negotiations
to the Government's raising the level of tariffs to permit Bank borrowers to earn
the minimum legal rate of return (10%) on remunerable assets in 1980.  The
mission also recommended the Bank's seeking a revenue covenant which strengthened
the financial soundness of Bank borrowers (i.e., maintained the value of assets,
recognized expenses fairly, and avoided over-reliance on recovering past and
current revenue shortfalls through future tariff increases).
4.10        In March 1980, in connection with another power loan to Brazil (1824-
BR) and after discussion at the highest levels of the Bank and the Government,
the Bank accepted a Government tariff and revenue proposal which they later
agreed to follow in connection with Loan 1939-BR.   Under this proposal, the
Government committed itself to: (i) approximate the 10% rate of return for the
sector in 1980 by increasing tariffs 30% in June 1980; (ii) provide a 10% rate
of return for the sector beginning in 1981 with future tariff increases; and
(iii) allow for recovery of revenue shortfalls in 1980, if any, and accumulated
shortfalls for prior years over a three-year period beginning in 1981. This
agreement explicitly recognized the possibility of a return on remunerable assets
below the 10% legal minimum in 1980, but was acceptable because of the prospect
of compliance in 1981 and subsequent years.   Like other revenue covenants
negotiated with Brazilian power borrowers, the revenue covenant applying to CHESF
would continue to rely on existing provisions of Brazilian law.
4.11        In these circumstances, the Government and CHESF agreed by side
letter to, respectively, provide and seek tariff levels sufficient to earn a 10%
rate of return for CHESF beginning in 1981 and subsequent years. By the time of
Board approval (December 23, 1980), the Brazilians had informed the Bank that:
(i) the financial performance of the sector had deteriorated in 1980 as compared
with what had been expected earlier -- namely, that the sector would earn a
return of about 7%, not 10%; (ii) the Government did not intend to guarantee a
10% return in 1981, only 8%; and (iii) the Government would provide a full 10%
beginning in 1982. In order to continue the dialogue with the Government on
tariff levels, and given the difficult economic circumstances confronting Brazil,
Bank management decided to present the loan to the EDs, but to present no
additional power loans without the Bank's having reached a reasonable agreement
with the Government on sector issues. The language of the side letter was not
amended to reflect the new position of the Government with respect to future
tariff policy.
4.12        Nenotiations.  No major issues delayed negotiation of the loan in
April/ May 1980. However, the project definition underwent a substantial change
after negotiations were completed (para. 4.05), although this change was not the
cause for postponing presentation of the loan to the Executive Directors from
June to July and then from July to December, 1980. This postponement was due to
procurement issues -- namely, the unsuccessful effort of Brazilian manufacturers
to persuade the Government to reserve the bidding on computers. Eventually, the
Government decided that this category of equipment should be procured through



a
ICB. The Bank did not revise estimates for costs and implementation to take into
account the effects of this delay.
5. Imnlementation
5.01        Loan Sianina. Effectiveness, and Tariff Levels.   Loan signing
occurred promptly (January 14, 1981) after approval by the EDs (December 23,
1980); but it was only after the Central Bank abandoned its lengthy efforts to
subject Loan 1939-BR to the disbursement regulations applying to the loans of
foreign commercial banks that the Bank declared the loan agreement to be
effective (August 5, 1981).  This delay to effectiveness contributed to late
project start-up.
5.02        The  next  delay  derived  from  the  Bank-Government  discussions
concerning the continuing deterioration of sector tariffs and finances in 1981.
The day after the Bank declared effective the loan agreement for Loan 1939-BR,
it unofficially suspended disbursements from all power loans to Brazil.   In
September, the Government dispatched a mission to the Bank to explain its
situation and to seek a new agreement on tariffe to supersede that which had been
agreed in 1980.  In October 1981, the Bank and the Government reached a new
agreement on sector tariff levels (para. 9.05)t and the Bank lifted the
unofficial suspension of disbursements.
5.03        Timetable.  Cost.  and Changes:   As compared with the expected
completion date of June 30, 1985, ELETROBRAS and CHESF. commissioned their
respective project components in 1989-1991, between five and seven years late
(Part III, Tables 3a and 3b). Part C, which consisted of training and studies,
was completed between 1984 and 1989.   The underlying causes of delay are
discussed below (paras. 5.09; 5.15; and 10.02-.04).
5.04        As shown in the Schedule 1 on the following page, which summarizes
data set forth in Part III, Table 4, the actual cost of the project is well below
(-18.5%) what was expected at appraisal. Stated in US dollars and reflecting
current prices, actual and forecast project expenditures through December 31,
1990 are, respectively: US$100.8 million vs. US$140.2 million.   Including
expenditures (US$13.4 million) by CHESF in 1991, some of which are estimated, the
project cost would rise to US$114.2 million. CHESF plans to spend an additional
US$101.5 million during the years 1992-1995 to expand its supervision and control
system, but such expansion, when it materializes, would be well beyond what was
contemplated at appraisal.   Given the significant tachnological changes in
computers and "software" which evolved during the long delay between appraisal
(1979) and commissioning (1988-91), a comparison of actual and forecast costs
(US$114.2 million vs. US$140.2 million) in prices of 1979 would not be a
meaningful exercise. As explained elsewhere (para. 7.01), in addition to the
proceeds of Loan 1939-BR, which were reallocated to help ELETROBRAS, additional
Bank financing for this project, about US$4.6 million, derived from a
reallocation of Loan 2564-BR.
5.05        Expenditures for Part B (telecommunications) were substantially less
than expected.  In the case of ELETROBRAS, reduced expenditures were due to
improvements in the public communications networks, making such expenditures
redundant (para. 5.12). In the case of CHESF, reduced expenditures were due to
financial constraint (para. 5.17).

5.06          Parts A & B (3LETROBRASI: Timina and Costs  In 1989, five years late,
ELETROBRAS commissioned the CSC building and the RTSS (paras. 3.01-.02)
(ELETROBRAS, Part A), plus related telecommunications equipment (ELETROBRAS, Part
B). Final integration of the telecommunications facilitLes was completed in 1991
(Part III. Table 3a). Delays to the ELETROBRAS component began with late loan
approval, late effectiveness, and the temporary suspension of disbursements from
all Bank power loans (paras. 4.12, 5.01 and 5.02). Delays continued to plague
implementation due to lengthy disagreements between ELETROBRAS and the
consultant/supplier on the work to be done (para. 5.09).



10
5.07        The actual and forecast costs of the work carried out by ELETROBRAS
under Parts A and B were US$58.0 millions and US$48.5 million, respectively.
Part of this cost increase was due to a devaluation of the US dollar against the
French franc (see para. 7.01).
5.08        In 1981, with respect to the RTSS, ELETROBRAS and a consultant/
supplier signed a contract for providing the computer equipment, and the
development and integration of the "software" to operate the computers, plus
training. This contract was later expanded to include the supply of equipment
for the installation of a software development facility in Rio de Janeiro. As
explained later (para. 10.02-.04), ICB was not suited to this project.
5.09        Having prepared a "Work Statement", which detailed their respective
responsibilities, ELETROBRAS and the consultant/supplier signed the contract,
including an agreed price 2. The impact of continuous improvement of computer
technologies, including the opportunity for upgrading "hardware", led to
disagreement on equipment specifications between ELETROBRAS and the consultant/
supplier.   Also contributing to disagreement were difficult problems of
communication and coordination due to the location of the consultant/supplier in
a distant foreign country. These factors -- technological change, communication
and coordination problems -- led ELETROBRAS and the consultant/supplier to
negotiate corrective Service Orders and other adjustments in 1983, 1984, 1985,
and 1987. Further complicating matters was the inappropriateness of ICB for this
type of project (paras. 10.02-.04).
5.10        The RTSS was commissioned in 1989, five years late.  Preparation of
the application "software" has continued into 1991. The final cost of this
element of the project, which also included training, was US$51.5 million vs. the
appraisal estimate of US$38.4 million. The increase of US$13.1 was due extra
equipment costs (US$5.3 million) and extra consultant costs (US$7.9 million)
offset by a modest reduction (US$0.1 million) in other areas. Both of these
extra costs reflected the devaluation of the US dollar against the French franc
(Part III, Table 5, footnote 3.)
5.11        Construction of the special CSC building was completed in early 1986,
three and one-half years late. Installation of the special auxiliary equipment
(fire prevention, atmospheric control, and uninterruptible, back-up power) was
completed in 1987, almost five years late.   Contributing to the delays in
completing the building were: (i) initial difficulties in securing financing; and
(ii) the later bankruptcy on the part of the contractor. Commissioning of the
CSC building was completed in 1989. The actual and forecast costs of the CSC
building were close: US$4.9 million and US$5.0 million, respectively.
5.12        Final integration (1991) of the telecommunications component (Part
B -- ELETROBRAS), although six years behind schedule, was not subject to the
technical difficulties which affected the RTSS.   This component involved
installing communications links between the CSC and the various COSs through (i)
the public systems; and (ii) the private communications systems of the power
companies participating in the RTSS. The basic function of the voice facilities

was to communicate dispatch orders. There were also telex circuit and circuits
for the transmission of data. Improved performance by the public system led to
greater reliance on rented communications cbannele and a reduced investment in
private  communications  systems.    The  actual  cost  was  US$1.3  million,
substantially less than the forecast level of US$5.1 million.
5.13        Parts A & B (CHESFI: Timinu and Cost:   CHESF completed:  (i)
construction of an enlarged COS building in 1987, almost five years late; (ii)
commissioning of the system for control and supervision and subsystem for
information in 1990, five years late; and (iii) the first stage of a microwave
and UHF system linking the COS with dispatch centers, power plants, and
substations in 1990, almost seven years late. Final integration into SINSC is
not expected until about the first quarter of 1992. In addition to late loan
approval, late effectiveness, and suspended disbursements (paras. 4.12; 5.01-
.02), disagreements with consultant/suppliers and financial constraints
contributed to delayed project implementation.
5.14        After difficult and long negotiations, which again reflected the
"high tech" nature of the project, CHESF signed a contract with a consultant/
supplier for computers and related "software" in December 1983, about 18 months
late.   The next year, there were significant problems with the consultant/
supplier, including the purchase of unauthorized equipment and the use by the
consultant/supplier of CHESF 'hardware" on other projects. After nearly two
years of disagreement between CHESF and the consultant/supplier, the Bank helped
to mediate a resolution. In December 1985, CHESF agreed to an amendment of the
contract.    Because  of  additional  delays  in manufacturing,  testing,  and
installation, full commissioning of the CSC was five years behind schedule.
5.15        CHESF began construction of the COS building in January 1984, about
two years late.  This initial delay was due to problems in securing local-
currency financing. All of the support systems (fire prevention, environmental
control, and uninterruptible, back-up power) were operational in 1988.
5.16        The actual cost of the work completed by CHESF (A & B combined)
amounted to US$49.1 millions as compared with the forecast cost of US$71.7
million (Part III, Table 4). There were major savings due to lower prices for
computers, plus major savings on engineering/administration and consultants, and
lower expenditures for telecommunications. The actual and forecast costs of the
CSC were, respectively, US$36.2 million and US$42.9 million. The actual cost of
the CSC building was US$4.0 million as compared with the appraisal estimate of
US$5.0 million.
5.17        The actual and forecast costs of the telecommunications components
were, respectively, US$8.8 million and US$23.9 million. The reduced level of
expenditures were due to financial constraint.   Additional expenditures are
planned in the 1990s.
5.18        Part C: Tariff Studies and Sector Trainina:  As shown in Schedule 2
below, actual expenditures for Part C (US$6.9 million, including US$4.0 million
of foreign costs) were well (-65.3%) below their expected level (US$20.0 million,
including US$5.0 million of foreign costs). Concerning the sector training pro-
gram, the semi-annual project progress reports provided by ELETROBRAS indicate
a forecast foreign cost of US$4.85 million and a forecast local cost of US$14.988
million. The Loan Agreement (Schedule 1) indicates that the US$5.0 million of



12
foreign costs for Part C would be covered by initial allocations of loan proceeds
amounting to US$4.85 million for sector training and US$0.15 million for tariff
studies. No local currency costs were estimated at appraisal in connection with
the tariff study.

1992, ELETROBRAS maintained that foreign cost of training and tariff study should be, respectivety,

5.19        Tariff Studies.  Actual expenditures for the tariff btudy amounted
to US$526,673 as compared with a forecast cost of US$150,000.
5.20        Tariff studies based on marginal cost principles were initially
funded under Loan 1300-BR.  DNAEE, assisted by a foreigr consultant and in
collaboration with ELETROBRAS, led this effort. The ultimate objective was to
develop tariff levels and structures based on the anticipated cost of supply and
thereby to stimulate the economic use of electricity by customers.
5.21        In March 1979, the initial phase of this study found thatt (i)
existing tariff levels were below tariff levels based on the marginal cost of
supple; (ii) the introduction of seasonal differentials and of different
weighting for capacity charges and energy charges, etc. had economic merit; and
(iii) additional studies were necessary, including studies on the application of
marginal pricing to bulk supply.
5.22        In September 1981, the additional studies financed under Loan 1939-BR
recommended: (a) a detailed timetable of measures and step. for implementing
marginal-cost based tariffs; (b) the substitution of regional "reference" tariffs
corresponding to the North/Northeast, Southeast/Central-Weet, and South for the
existing nation-wide tariff; (c) additional studies on the marginal cost of
supply in each concessionaire; and (d) development of marginal-cost based tariffs
for low-voltage customers. The Bank judged the recommendations of this study to
be sound; and in due course all the recommendations, except (b) were carried out.
5.23        In connection with (a), the Government introduced Decree No. 86,463
(dated October 13, 1981) which authorized the establishment of hourly, seasonal,
and user-related differences in tariffs, changes in metering and billing
practices, and the distribution of the cost of service between capacity charges
and energy charges in such a way that each group of consumers pays for the
fraction for which it is responsible.
5.24        Recommendation  (b)  has  never  been  implemented.    Nation-wide
"reference" tariffs for different customer groups continue to prevail; and the
level of the actual price per kWh paid by any particular user group may be above,
the same as, or below the corresponding level of the "reference" tariff. As a
rule, high and medium voltage customers normally pay more than their
corresponding "reference" tariffs, thereby subsidizing residential, rural, and



13
other customers, who teind to pay less than their corresponding "reference"
tariffs.
5.25        On balance, the Bank judges the new tariff structure to be a success,
especially with respect to its modification of the shape of the load curve on the
part of medium and high-voltage customers. Sector financial results are another
story (para. 9.02-.04).   The Bank has recommended that the Government fully
implement marginal-cost based tariffs with respect to both level and structure.
If such tariff levels and structures materialize, the Bank estimates that demand
would be cut from 10% to 15% by the year 2,000 with considerable investment
savings.
5.26        Sector Trainina. At appraisal, expenditures for sector training were
expected to amount to US$19.838 million, including foreign-currency expenditures
of US$4.850 million. These expenditures would correspond to 3,060 staff-months
of staff training in Brazil supervised by BLETROBRAS and 525 staff-months of
staff training abroad. The trainlng would cover: civil construction, generation,
distribution, transmission, communications, administratLon, economics, finance,
and environment.
5.27        During the period  1982-1989,  expenditures  on  sector training
associated with the project amounted to US$6.42 million, including US$3.499
million of disbursements from Loan 1939-BR. This expenditure financed: (i) 998
man-months of staff training in the subjects listed above (civil construction,
etc.); (ii) 34 staff months of teaching by consultants in BrailI; and (iii)
acquisition of a small technical library. Notwithatanding the lower levels of
man-months and expenditures, the Bank and ELETROBRAS were satisfied with the
results of the sector training program.
6. Performance of Consultant/Sucpliers and Contractors.
6.01        DesPite the problems and delays, BLETROBRAS and CHESF expressed
satisfaction with the performance of their respective consultant/suppliers and
contractors. This reflected understanding of the situations of the respective
consultant/suppliers.
7. Allocation and Disburoements
7.01        The Bank agreed to reallocate the proceeds of Loan 1939-BR to provide
for the increasing costs of the tariff studies and Part A of the project,
including a reallocation of US$4.6 million from CHESF to ELETROBRAS (Part III,
Table 6). There was a corresponding reallocation of the proceeds of Loan 2564-BR
to benefit CHESF in connectlon with the SINSC project. The rationale for the
second reallocation was the identlty of purpose of Loans 1939-BR and 2564-BR.
Due to all the delays related to project implementation, the Bank responded
positively to the requests of BLETROBRAS to extend the closing date of the Loan.
(Part III, Table 2). The final closing date was December 31, 1989 as compared
with the original closing date of December 31, 1985. The flnal disbursement from
the loan was on May 18, 1990 (Part III, Tables 2 & 6).
8.0 Results of the Proiect.
8.01        Intearation into SINSC.  Intogratlon of the operating companies into
SINSC, which was expected to be completed ln June 1986, is behind schedule. For



14
example, according to ELETROBRAS, of the ten companies expected to enter SINSC,
three (FURNAS, CEMIG, and ELETROSUL) are expected to have completed integration
by December 19911 three are expected to have completed integration in 1992 (CESP,
CHESF, and CEEE); two are delayed three to five years (ELETROPAULO and LIGHT);
and two are delayed to the point of being non-scheduled (ELETRONORTE and COPEL)
(Part III, Table 7).
8.02        Internal Rate of Return.  lhe project is substantially completed.
However, the PCR does not include an estimate of the internal rate of return on
the project, as such calculation would be based on assumptions so numerous as to
quantified benefits as to be an unrealistic exercise. However, as set forth at
greater length in Annex 2, the project has produced: (i) fuel savings estimated
at US$4.4 million per year; (i) investment savings estimated at about US$1.2
million per year; and (iii) reduced losses from black-outs at a present value of
US$20.1 million.   When completed, SINSC will be well worth the effort and
investment.
9. Financial Performance:
9.01        Imiact of Government Policy on Sector/Companv Performance.   The
present legal structure of the sector is such that it iL fundamental to analyze
sector finances in order to interpret adequately the finances of ELETROBRAS and
CHESF. Also, given the paramount policy-setting authority of the Government over
the sector (para. 2.04), it is equally fundamental to analyze Government policies
toward the sector, especially with respect to levels of tariffs, to interpret
adequately sector and company financial performance, as such policies underlie
their respective performances. It is also important to understand the regulatory
regime through which those policies are implemented (paras. 2.05-.10).
9.02        Sector Tariffs. Borrowing. and Eauitv Contributions. After 1977 and
continuing through the decade of the 1980s, the Government, faced with difficult
policy choices and complex macroeconomic circumstances, including high inflation,
undermined the health of sector finances by allowing tariff levels to decline in
real terms. This decline, which was politically popular, was justified on the
grounds of fighting inflationary expectations.  From 1977 to 1989, the level of
average sector revenue per kWh sold declined about 39.6%, i.e., from US cents
4.612 to US cents 2.782 (reflecting 1987 prices)3. Borrowing -- some contracted
on terms not appropriate to a power utility implementing projects with long
gestation periods and economic lives -- and then equity contributions displaced
internal cash generation as the primary source of investment financing (see Part
III, Table 8).
9.03        In the early 1980s, the Government agreed with the Bank on programs
to improve sector finances through tariff increases and other means, but did not
fully implement these programs; therefore, the worsening financial trend of the
sector was only temporarily arrested. The real levels of the average revenue
were allowed to decline and hence the real levels of gross internal cash
generation, eroded by high inflation, failed to keep pace with the financial
needs of the sector. Between 1980 and 1984, the financial difficulties of the
power sector were exacerbated by greater reliance on borrowings. These rose from

US$4.1 billion to US$6.3 billion while net consumer-based funding declined from
about US$1.2 billion to -US$1.5 billion. Thereafter, borrowing declined as a
source of financing, except in 1988 and 1989 when it amounted to, respectively,
about US$6.3 billion and US$3.3 billion (including short-term borrowings and
other changes in working capital) while Government equLty contributions played
a larger and larger role in the total financing picture, rising from about US$1.1
billion in 1984 to almost US$6.6 in 1987 and then declining to US$5.1 billion in
1988. Data on equity contributions in 1989 is not available.
9.04        Sector Financial Ratios.  In circumstances of low tariffs, important
financial indicators deteriorateds since 1982, the debt-service coverage ratio
has been less than one and the ratio of net internal funding as a percent of
investment has been negative. Between 1980 and 1988, consumer-based finding as
a percent of total requirements declined from 18.8% to -147.5%; equity
contributions as a percent of total requirements increased from 14.2% to 110.6%;
and borrowing as a percent of total requirements increased from 67.0% to 136.9%.
9.05        Bank Efforts to Influence Government Policy.  By late 1981, due to
low tariff levels, the sector rate of return had declined below the legal minimum
of 10% established by law, and most of the Bank's power borrowers were unable to
comply with their respective revenue covenants which were based on Brazilian
power-tariff legislation. In their initial effort (September 1981) to address
the financial problem. of the power sector, the Government and the Bank agreed
on a tariff recovery plan featuring "real" tariff increases of 3% in 1982 and of
5% annually thereafter until the sector earned a return of 10% on remunerable
assets. The Bank confirmed this agreement by its letter to the Governmert of
December 23, 1981. The letter also provided that the Bank would not enforce the
covenants of previous loans relating to rate of remuneration as long as the
Government and the power companies complied with the plan for sector financial
recovery.
9.06        In 1982, because the Government implemented tariff increases at a
slower rate than needed to raise the "real" level as called for under the plan,
the level of the average tariff in "real" terme was about 10% below the level of
1981; and the sector did not cover its debt service (para. 9.04).  The plan
failed to achieve its objective because political considerations dominated the
thinking of the Government.   Also contributing to this result were defects
inherent in the plan, implementation delays, and high levels of inflation.
9.07        In 1983, the Government and the Bank amended the 1981 plan to reflect
new financial targets and a new timetable for financial recovery; and when the
sector again did not meet the new targets, the Government and the Bank agreed in
1986 on a third plan of financial recovery (Power Sector Recovery Plan -- PSRP)
which the Bank supported with a sector adjustment loan (2720-BR, US$500 million).
The PSRP was part of a larger plan for macroeconomic stabilization, the "Cruzado"
Plan, which featured price controls, including a freeze on electricity prices.
In August 1987, the Bank and the Government discontinued their efforts to
negotiate a second sector adjustment loan due to the re-introduction of price
controls, including a freeze on electricity tariffs. At about the same time,
governments of the more important states of the South and Southeast authorized
their respective power companies to withhold payments to the sector revenue-
sharing mechanism which transferred financial resources from the financially
stronger power companies to the financially weaker companies.   This action



16
eventually forced the Government, very much agaLnet its will, to raised sector
tariffsa  From tim.. to time since 1987, the state governments have protested the
sector policies of the Government by not only withholding payments to the
revenue-sharing mechanism but also withholding payments to the ELETROBRAS
operating companies for bulk slectriclty purchases. Because of the low level of
payments by the financially stronger state companies -- even non-payment --
operations of the revenue-sharing mechanism are at a very low level.
9.08        The Bank and the Government renewed theLr efforts to negotiate a
second sector adjustment loan in 1988 and a loan promoting envLronmental reform
and conservation in 1989 but these efforts failed due to the Government's
choosing other strategic objectives and deterioratlng economic conditions. A
full discussion of the expectations and results for Loan 2720-BR appears in OED
Report No.  267 (dated December 1990).
9.09        During the years 1981-1989, the Bank, noting the difficulty and
complexity of the macroeconomlc and political problems of Brazil, felt that it
would be more useful to help the Brazilians to formulate and implement a credible
plan of tariff and financial recovery than to suspend disbursements or to stop
the proceusing and approval of new loans. Accordingly, the Bank, relying on the
recovery plans agreed with the Government in 1981, 1983, and 1986, continued to
make investment loans (2138-BR, 2364-5-BR, etc.) and a sector adjustment loan
(2720-BR), which benefitted, Lnter _ali, CHESFg and subsequently tried to process
an additional sector loans in 1987-88 and a loan promoting environmental reform
in 1989.   Notwithstanding their disappointing results,  the plans and the
subsequent loan-processing efforts provided a useful vehicle for dialogue with
the Government.   It is likely that they helped to prevent worse financial
deterioration, although thie cannot be proven.
9.10        Throughout this period, the decLisons of DNAEE and BLETROBRAS with
respect to levels for tariffs, investments, and borrowing were subject to review
by SEAP and SEST (paras. 2.05-.11) for consistency wlth the larger macroeconomic
strategy of the Government. Final declisons were taken at the ministerial level
and reflected short-run coneiderations, political, financial, or economic. The
Bank did not object to thie regime.
9.11         BLETROB *AS.  In the above circumetances of financial constraint,
between 1980 and 1985, the period of project implementation expected at
appraisal, the actual financial performance of ELETROBRAS was below forecast
levels. ELETROBRAS, as a holdLng company and investment bank, generates revenues
primarily from dividends paid on its shareholdings and interest paid on its
loans; and during thie period summarized income (Cr$299.9 billion, reflecting
prices of 1979) was almost 21% loes than expected (Cr$379.1 billion) while actual
summarized cash operating expenses (Cr$19.2 billion) were only 17.6% less than
expected (Cr$28.9 billion).  In the years 1986 and 1987, revenues fell from
Cr$56.7 billion to Cr$28.7 billion and thereafter climbed strongly: Cr$49.1
billion in 1988 and Cr$S88.0 billlon in 1989 (69e Schedule 3 on the following
page; and Part III, Table 9).
9.12        The net internal cash generation of ELETROBRAS plus other financial
resources derived from the operations of the power companies (reversion and
compulsory loan) constitutes net consumer-based resources.  Loans and equity
contributions, together with net consumer-based resources, constitute the sources
of funds for the investments of ELETRODRAS: stock or equity purchases, loan and



17
advances, and other.   For the period 1980-1985, the shortfall of summarized
applications (-Cr$156.8 billion) was matched by a corresponding shortfall in net-
consumer based funding (-Cr$410.3 billion) only partially offset by a surplus of
equity contributLons (CrS49.5 billion), borrowing (Cr6166.2 billion), and other
sources  (Cr$37.8 billion).   During the four years 1986-1989, debt service
obligations consumed all but a small part of gross internal cash generation, and
because of a change in tariff legislation reducing the reversion charge and the
sector's share of the compulsory loan, equity contributions and borrowings had
to assume all but a small part of the financing burden.

revenues (CrS54.0 million stated in prices of 1979) were below forecast levels:
respectively, 140.4 MWh, Cr$61.21/kWh, and Cr$86.0 million. Further, the returns
on remunerable assets were below covenanted levels (10%). However, since the
revenue covenants of loan agreements for power projects in Brazil had been
succeeded by a series of sector financial recovery plane, the Bank considered
these low returns to be acceptable, as long as the financial performance of the
sector conformed to the targets and timetables of gradual recovery set forth in
the different plans (see Schedule 4, below; also Part III, Table lOa).

9.14        For the years 1986-1989, sales levels were about 25.8 MWh annually
and average tariff levels trended downward, except in 1988.5 The financial rate
of return (net operation income as a percent of average net fixed assets in
operation) declined from 4.4% in 1986 to -3.2% in 19891 and debt-service coverage
also trended downward: 0.4X in 1987 to 0.1X in 1989.
9.15        Actual and forecast summarized levels of investment and other
expenditure were close (Cr$57.9 million vs. CrS54.9 million, a difference of
Cr$3.0 million). CHESF financed this additional investment expenditure (Cr$3.0
million) plus the shortfalls of negative net internal cash generation (Cr$16.5)
and actual and forecast borrowing (Cr$2.0 million) with additional equity
contributions (Cr$10.8 million) and additional short-term borrowing (Cr$10.7
million). The actual and forecast summary ratios for debt service coverage were
0.5X and 0.7X; the actual and forecast summary ratios for self financing were
both negative. The ratios for borrowing as a percent of investment expenditure
were 127.3% and 112.5%.
9.16        During the years 1986-1989, CHESF experienced major problems with
collections from its customers, the state power companies which withheld payments
from CHESF as an easy way to finance their expansion programs and protest low
tariff levels. Receivables rose from Cr$4.5 billion in 1986 (equivalent to 140
days of revenues) to Cr$7.8 billion in 1987 (equivalent to 356 days of revenues)
and then declined to Cr$3.9 billion in 1989 (equivalent to 198 days of revenues).
CHESF, in turn, simply suspended payments to its creditors and suppliers with the
result that its debt-equity ratios, which declined from 55/45 in 1987 to 48/52
in 1989, are misleadingly low.
10.0 Performance of the ELETROBRAS. CHESF, the Bank, and the Government.
10.01       Proiect Issues.   ELETROBRAS and CHESF responded rationally and
flexibly to their respective circumstances, market and financial.   Their
financial performances reflected the impact of policies set by the Government
(paras. 9.02-.03).  They complied with the major covenants of the Loan and
Project Agreements  (Part III, Table 11).   Their staffs were technically
competent. The changes to the project were appropriate (para. 5.05); but the
performances of ELETROBRAS and CHESF, like that of the Bank, did not indicate at
appraisal an appreciation of the nature of the project, the complexity related
to the acquisition and development of "hardware" and "software", and the impact
of technological change -- that is, how it would impact differently on the
interests of the beneficiaries and the consultant/suppliers (para. 4.07)6 .
10.02       Because the project involved applying the cutting edge of computer
and "software" technologies to the efficient operation of interconnected power
operations, it more nearly resembled what one would seek from a consultant (an
intellectual product) than it resembled a normal power transmission project
(civil works, equipment, etc.).   That the Bank, ELETROBRAS, and CHESF should
have not appreciated the complexities of acquisition and development of such
In its letter of February 21, 1992, ELETROBRAS observed that during the period 1980-1989 CHESF's average
price (or average revenue per kwh sold) declined 28.5X white the Brazil-wide average tariff dectined
30.4X over the same period.
* ELETROBPAS maintains that it and CHESF had a realistic concept of the project at the time of preparation
(see Part 11 Sections 11, page 30).

technologies is understandable, au they are not normally in the business of
financing and carrying out "high tech" projects. It is understandable that they
did not anticipate or appreciate the speed of technological change and its impact
on the project. It is also understandable that they judged ICB to be applicable
to this project when the reverse was the case.
10.03       If the Bank is to avoid in the future the delays which plagued this
project, it is appropriate to expand on thet (a) implementation experience of
ELETROBRAS to acquire and develop "hardware" and "software"; and (b) impact of
technological change on ELETROBRAS and the consultant/supplier, as conditioned
by ICB. Implementation involved four steps: the (l) selection and installation
of computers appropriate to the RTSS; (ii) design of computer-telecommunication
interfaces; (iii) selection of standard "software" to operate the computers; and
(iv) development of application "software" fitted to the characteristics of the
power system. Steps (ii) and (iv) involved preparatory work which was extremely
difficult for the bidder to estimate at an early stage as to effort, time and
cost. The degree of difficulty exceeded that normally associated with estimating
the time and cost of constructing civil works or installing substation equipment.
Since the specifications for civil works and equipment are usually known well in
advance of the bidding process, the bidder can make a reasonable estimate of his
costs and time; and hi selection through ICB is appropriate. But, as explained
below, the selection of the consultant/supplier for the proposed project through
ICB was not appropriate.
10.04       The project involved technology which was continuously changing and
evolving. In such circumstances, once the consultant/supplier had been selected,
a "Work Statement" agreed, and a contract aigned on the basis of ICB, this
evolution had differing impacts on the consultant/supplier and the beneficiary.
That is, in a dynamic situation involving many choices and many unknowns, the
consultant/supplier was biased toward fulfilling his obligations at the contract
price, even if it meant not using the most technologically advanced "hardware"
and "software" while ELETROBRAS was interested in obtaining the most
technologically advanced system, the cost to the bidder notwithstanding. Lengthy
disagreement requiring contract revision characterized implementation following
the selection of consultant/suppliers through rCB. In effect, ICB meant putting
the cart before the horse, i.e., agreeing on a price before final agreement on
the work to be done.
10.05       The procurement procedure which should have prevailed (but did not):
would have involveds (i) selection from a "short list" of qualified consultant/
suppliers; (ii) preparation of and agreement to a "Work Statement" by owner and
selected consultant/supplier; and (iii) negotiation of a price in connection with
the agreed "Work Statement"; and (iv) in the event of technological change
calling into question the agreed "Work Statement" etc., provision for flexibility
to adjust the price on the basis of agreed changes.   What actually happened --
agreement on price in the context of ICB with no allowance for technological
change and price flexibility -- placed bidder and buyer in a situation
encouraging delay (paras. 5.09; 5.15).7
' ELETROSRAS dfsagree with this judgwet (Part 11, Section 1ll, page 30).



21
10.06       The level and extent of Bank supervision war appropriate (Part III,
Table 12). The Bank was successful in mediating in the negotiations between a
major contractor/supplier and CHESP, which effort avoided cancellation of the
contract and further delay to the project (para. 5.15). It was also the opinion
of ELETROBRAS that the connection of the Bank with the project helped to ensure
the cooperation of the consultant/suppliers at difficult moments -- that is, the
consultant/suppliers, besides wanting to receive payment for their work, wanted
to avoid possible penalty attached to abandoning the project, such as exclusion
from future Bank-financed operations.
10.07       Sector Issues. The involvement of the Bank with ELETROBRAS and CHESF
took place in the wider context of its continuing dialogue with the Government
on restoring sector finances (paras. 9.05-.09). Between 1981 and 1986, the Bank,
taking account of the complex economic, financial, and political problems of
Brazil, made a series of investment loans and one sector adjustment loan based
on a series of understandings that the Government would implement three credible
plans negotiated in 1981, 1983, and 1986 for rehabilitating the finances of the
sector. The plans failed to achieve their objective because the Government, in
its effort to combat inflation and due to political considerations plus other
factors (such as short-coming inherent to the plans), did not support the sector
with adequa. 9 tariff levels. Between 1987 and 1989, despite strenuous efforts,
the Bank and the Government were unable to agree on terms for new lending due to
tariff, macroeconomic, and other conditions. In such circumstances, there was
very little that the Bank could do to influence policy.
10.08       During the above years, the Government subordinated the financial
performaace of the sector to its short-run macroeconomic objectives, especially
fighting inflation. The Government also introduced a new regime which displaced
DNAEE and ELETROBRAS as primary decision makers on tariffs and planning. As the
Bank had considered DNAEE and ELETROBRAS to be part of the Government, the new
regime was considered to be an extension of past regulatory trends (paras. 2.0$-
.10; 4.08; 9.05-.08; 9.10).
11. Lessons to be Learned.
11.01       Proiect Lessons.  This project, which involved the adaptation of a
rapidly evolving technology to the needs of a large and growing power system and
the creation of an intellectual product, did not lend itself well to procurement
under ICB.   Indeed,  ICB contributed to disagreements and delays in the
implementation of the project. In the future, if the Bank is again faced with
the choice of financing such a project, it should either agree to employ the
procurement procedures related to the contracting of consultants -- including
flexibility as to price in the event of changes agreed by the borrower and
consultant/supplierl or if that is not possible, it should decline to finance the
project.
11.02       Sector Lessons. The sector lessons relate to the regulatory regime
and Bank lending. It seems clear that establishing the institutional autonomy
of DNAEE (or of a new regulatory agency) is a necesnary first stop toward
insulating   sector  policy  from  *hort-run  political  or  macroeconomic
considerations; and that the Government should begin to consider those steps
leading to establishment. Further, in order to prevent future domination of the
regulators by the regulated, DNAEE or the new regulatory agency should include,



22
in addition to representatives of the Government, representatives of the various
consumer groups.
11.03       The financial performance of the sector during the 1980. illustrates
the need for an autonomous regulatory agency tot (i) enforce power tariff
legislation mandating the level and structure of tariffs in line with the
marginal cost of supply} and (ii) protect the sector from the impact of short-run
policy shifts on the part of the Government.   In the 1980s, the Government
ignored legislation relating to power tariffs and DNAEE in favor of review by
planning agencies. Furthermore, the Government agreed with the Bank on a series
of financial rehabilitation plans which took the place of existing financial
covenants based on the norms of tariff legislation. The substitution of these
plans for the tariff legislation started the sector on a downhill path which
continually allowed for the subordination of the long-term financial needs of the
sector to the short-run (and unsuccessful) inflation-control programs of the
Government.
11.04       Notwithstanding its adverse impact on sector finances, this situation
continues to prevail. For example, between 1987 and 1989, due to macroeconomic,
tariffs and other issues, the Bank and the Government did not agree on the terms
for new loans to the power sector.   In June 1990,  after the Government
implemented major tariff increases to reach 90% of an agreed target level, the
Bank approved a new loan to support a power transmission and conservation
project. Effectiveness and continued disbursement are conditioned on achieving
and maintaining the target tariff level; however, twenty-two (22) months after
loan approval, the target tariff level has not been reached and the loan
agreement has not been signed. The existence of an autonomous regulatory agency
with proper power might have avoided this situation.
11.05       There is another lesson to be learned about the proper circumstances
for Bank lending: continuing to lend despite the record of unkept financial
rehabilitation plans undermined the credibility of the Bank and led to
expectations on the part of the Government that the Bank would not insist on
adherence to either covenants or plans. This message did not contribute toward
implementation of the plans. It seems clear that lending in circumstances of
continuing financial deterioration sends the borrower the wrong message and leads
to a significant risk that agreed plans for financial rehabilitation will not be
observed.

Annex I
Proiect Preparations Chances in Scope, Content. and Cost
1.    At appraisal, the project definition included: (i) the CSC at Brasilia and
the COSs of LIGHT and CHESF (Part A); and (li) related telecommunication
facilities (Part B). The cost was expected to amount to US$304.5 million with
a foreign currency cost of US$76.9 million (see the table on the following page).
The Bank would loan US$70.0 million to cover the foreign cost of items procured
under ICB.
2.    Both before and after negotiations, the scope, content, and cost of the
project were subject to change. For example, before negotiations, in connection
with the first draft SAR (Yellow Cover, dated March 14, 1980), it was agreed to
reduce the scope of Part B -- that is, to reduce the CHESF telecommunications
component to only that part of the planned system which would directly benefit
the project. This was much smaller than what had previously been appraised --
that is, CHESF had planned a telecommunications system serving all of the North-
eastern region, but only a small part of that system would serve the needs of
SINSC.
3.    As a result of this reduction, Bank staff recommended a loan of US$68.5
million to help finance a project costing US$162.7 million with a foreign-
currency cost of US$70.3 million (see the table on the following page -- Draft
SAR, "Yellow Cover"). Since all of the bidding for telecommunications equipment
(Part B) would be reserved to local manufacturers, the Bank would not provide
financing for this component. The Bank loan would cover (i) the foreign-currency
cost of Part A (US$66.1 million, less US$O.1 million for small items not suitable
for ICB); and (ii) the local-currency cost of coneulting services for Part A
(US$2.5 million). The beneficiaries would furnish the financial resources to
cover their respective remaining costs in foreign and local currencies.
4     Later (and still prior to negotiations), there was an another change to the
project: the addition of Part C, which consisted of a sector training program,
3,060 man-months in Brazil and 525 man-months abroad. Part C was expected to
cost US$17.0 million, with a foreign-currency component of US$3.0 million. As
a result of this change, Bank staff recommended a loan of US$69 million to help
finance a project costing US$179.8 million with a foreign-currency cost, US$73.4
million. The Bank loan would cover the foreign exchange costs of Parts A and C,
respectively, US$66.1 million, less US$0.1 million for small items not suitable
for ICB, and US$3.0 million (see Draft SAR, "Green Cover", dated April 9, 1980).
The beneficiaries would supply their respective financing balances in foreign and
local currencies.
5     After negotiations, there was a second agreement to reduce the scope of
Parts A and B (and therefore the cost of the project) by eliminating the
corresponding facilities planned for LIGHT. This agreement had its origins in
the decision of the Government to reorganize LIGHT as two separate companies --
one serving Rio de Janeiro (LIGHT) and the other serving Sao Paulo (ELETROPAULO).
Given this decision of the Government, ELETROBRAS, LIGHT, and the Bank agreed to
eliminate from the loan financing for this component. The operations of LIGHT
would be controlled through the operations center of FURNAS; the operations of
ELETROPAULO would be controlled the operations center of CESP. There was also



24
additional agreement to expand Part C to include funding to continue studies on
the application of tariffs based on principles of the marginal cost of supply.
As finally defined, the cost of the project was expected to amount to US$140.2
million with a foreign-currency cost of US$58.2 million. The Bank loan would
amount to US$54.0 million and wab expected to cover the cost of items procured
under ICB. The table below compares the changes in the cost of the project
corresponding to the changes in the scope and content of the project, as
described above.

R&burn on the Prolact
Backaround.
1.   The need for a computerized supervision and control system at electric
utilities -- sometimes called an energy management system (EMS) -- increases
as the networks expand and installed capacity grows. Due to increased
technical capability, the number of standard functions and options of the EMS
has increased; and due to price decreases even a small electric utility can
now afford some sort of EMS. Despite its obvious operating improvements for
dispatchers, maintenance personnel, supervisors and programming personnel, how
to evaluate the economic benefits of an EMS is not obvious. In essence it is
easy to list a qualitative number of operational benefits attributable to the
availability of an EMS and an educated operations manager may even classify
these benefits in order of importance. Quantifying much benefLts, however, is
a particularly difficult task, because of the complexity of estimating the
likely effects and consequences of having the EMS implemented in the system
(with/without case study).
2.    Tle e:onomic evaluation of the first etage of SINSC is a particularly
diff'l.-:;t task because it includes the central CSC and as many as ten COSs
coordinated in two layers of hierarchical decision levels8. Additionally,
the Bank-financed project includes only the central CSC and one of the CoSe
(CHESF's); it would be difficult to separate the role of the central CSC in
relation to the whole SINSC --which includes supervisory functions over the
huge South/Southeast/Centralweet and the North/Northeast interconnected
systems-- and its role in relation to CHESF's COS, and then to separate again
the role of the CHESF's COS from other utilities' COSe in the North/Northeast
interconnected system. Finally, there is a timing problem with regard to the
actual realization of the benefits as only a few of the COSe are in operation
and others are still in different phases of implementation making it very
difficult to produce a stream of benefits, even assumLng that the
l plementation schedule now foreseen for each of the COS will take place as
planned. Thus, the actual evaluation of economic benefits attributable to the
project becomes an impossible task. The SAR recognized this fact and resorted
to foreign experience9, to estimate that implementation of the SINSC project
would permit 1% investment savings in developing the power systems. Though no
details are provided in the BAR, these investment savings seeml to result in
a 13% ERR. Other benefits related to operational savings and quality of
service improvements are mentioned, but not quantified.
Not to mention a third level, the Regfonal Energy Management Systems that are being Implemented in the
networks of some of the utilities Included In the SINSC system.

3.    Customarily, the PCR updates the SAR economic evaluation and discusses
any possible deviation from the SAR estimate. As noted above, there is little
basis for doing this for the present PCR; it would be an extremely complex and
unrealistic exercise. For theme reasons we do not attempt a true economic
evaluation. Instead, we list the qualitat$ve technical benefits attributable
to the project, and as a way of example, we try to make a quansitative
evaluation of a few of them. From comparing the magnitude of the possible
benefits which can be attained from the implementation of the EMS with its
estimated costs, it becomes clear that benefits will more than offset costs.
Benefits
4.    An EMS results in technical improvements to the electric system's
operation, which, in turn, result in economic benefits. Technical
improvements are provided by the EMS's data acquisition and supervisory
control, automatic generation control, and network analysis capabilities and
the possibilities of better and easier recording and reporting. Economic
benefits are expected in the following areas:
A. Savings due to enerav oRtimization. These can be achieved by
improved operational planning tools made available by the EMS --the
continuous data acquisition from remote sites, such as generators and
sub-stations, and remote control at those sites. Such operational
planning seek: (i) long-term optimization of hydro resources, reduction
of spilling, reduction of thermal generation, and interchange scheduling
(ii) short-term load forecasting and generation scheduling including
optimization of spinning reserve, load management, closer interchange
control, and (iii) reduction of lossees due to low flow optimization.
B. Investment savings. Improved operational planning may result in
reduction --and sometimes postponement-- of investments due, inter alia,
to a reduction in the spinning reserve margin, operating equipments
closer to its rating (e. g. avoiding overloading of transformers and
other major equipments which otherwise would shorten their useful life
or even result in a major fault).
C. Improved maintenance schedulina and safetv. The closer and more
precise coordination of generation and transmission equipment permits to
improve maintenance scheduling, which increases equipment life
expectancy, and increases system reliability. Recloser blocker and
other actions that ensure the safety of field work are easily performed
by the dispatcher and the ability to deenergize a downed line increases
the public safety.
D. ImDroved system security. The periodic review of the system's
security through network state estimation analysis --which is performed
automatically by the application software as often as every seven
minutes-- is able to early detect any possible weaknesses in the
network.



27
E. Imoroved reliability and auality of su22ly. Automatic generation
control and telecommand of sub-stations permits to supply energy with
more stable frequency and voltages which come closer to the nominal
standards. System recomposition --to recover the network from a major
disturbance-- is also shortened by the :elecommand capability of EMSs.
F. Post-disturbance analysis. Immedlate and exact recording permits
the precise analysis of any disturbance and helps the taking of any
corrective actions to avoid the occurrence of future events.
G. Recording and Reportino. Reporting requirements can be easily
tailored to the utilities' needs as the data base in automatically build
up and any data needed for administrative purposes such as energy
transactions and billing are equally recorded and reported. Complete
time-tagged record of each alarm and significant event is provided and
makes easier to recommend and take corrective actions to avoid
contingencies.
Some Cases of Ouantified Benefits
5.    Base on system data and the experience gained so far by ELETROBRAS with
the operation of SINSC in its interim shape and CHESF staff with the operation
of its COS, following we present cases in which, though very rough, some
estimate of benefits is possible. We do not intend to add up these benefits,
as this would give the wrong impression that the figure would represent the
total benefits. We contend that benefits are potentially much higher than any
of these estimates.
H. Enerav Ootimization. Energy generation in the two major
interconnected systems and Itaipu is in the order of 240 TWh/year, of
which 10 TWh/year are thermal and nuclear. Even modest gains in energy
optimization would permit postponing of investments in generating
capacity and fuel savings. Assuming that hydro energy optimization
would permit a 1% reduction in water spilling, or roll over postponement
of about 300 MW of installed capacity, at an estimated cost of about US$
72.0 million/year11. Fuel savings already observed in 1990 amounted to
100 MW thermal capacity for 5 hours/day during summer time or 219
GWh/year, a savings of about US$ 4.4 million/year12.
I. Reduction of Investments. Though difficult to estimate, the scope
for investment saving is clearly high in a system that invest US$ 4-5
billion/year. It is estimated that, only in the South region, better
use of transformers could result in savings of about 200 MW of
transformer capacity or about US$ 1.2 million/year13.
J. Reduction of black outs and recovery time from back outs. The
April, 1984 black out lasted three hours and curtailed 5,000 MW and

15,000 MWh. The estimated cost to the economy of such event is
estimated at US$ 30.0 million --assuming that the cost to the economy of
the non-served energy is USS 2.0/kWh. It is estimated that the
frequency of such events could be reduced from one in every five years
to one in every ten years, while the system recomposltion time could be
reduced to 0.5 hour; thus the expected savings from each event would be
US$ 27.5 million, US$ 2.75/year or US$ 20.1 million present valuel4.

Part I:s Proiect Review from Borrower's P-ersective
[Editorial Note: Attached to a letter dated February 21, 1992 and set forth
below are the Borrower's comments on Part I. Zn the Interest of saving the
reader tiite, the letter IN not reproduced below, as It set forth corrections
with respect to facts, which were minor, and typographical errors.)
The information contained ln Part I of the PCR recounts the
history of the implementation of the SCS and CNOS projects carried out by
CHESF and ELETROBRAS.
We make the following observations as a contribution to the
experience shared with IBRD throughout that process.
I.          Material contained in earller Technical Reports already forwarded
to the Bank
We should first like to note that in our Final Report, dated
October 1990, there is a mistake in the CNOS Project Implementation Schedule
(Annex 4a, p. 1, para. 1.2, "Preparation of Work Statement"). The tasks
referred to in this paragraph were not completed in 1985 but at the time of
signature of the contract with the supplier of the RTSS, as apparent from
earlier Technical Reports sent to the Bank.
As the PCR was based on our Final Report to the Bank, the
conclusion reached with respect to the time taken in preparing the Work
Statement is not surprising.15
II.         Nature o0  the riect
Setting up an energy management system is one of the most complex
kinds of task, whose successful implementation depends on a wide variety of
factors; even limiting ourselves to factors of a technical nature, we are
obliged to recognise that it involves a complicated mesh of multi-disciplinary
knowledge of which contractors and suppliers must be in full command.
CHESF and ELETROBRAS, aware of the high-tech nature of their
projects, contracted with international-level consulting firms, both foreign
and domestic, which carried out a planning study, drew up technical
specifications and provided technical support during the most critical phases
of the projects. Both enterprises also worked in conjunction with suppliers
and consultants in providing technical training for their staff involved in
implementation of the projects.
CHES and ELETROMRAS had no previous experlence in the utilization/
operation of an EMS or similar systems. Since an energy management system
(EMS) is an information system expected to reflect final-user needs accurately,
we regarded the method of developing it as a crucial component inseparable from
the nature of the project. On the subject cE the observations made in the
Part 1, para. 5.09 has been corrected to reflect above comnent.



30
Evaluation Summary of the PCR ("Project Issuess Delayed Implementation"), we
wish to note that neither ELETROBRAS nor CHESF lacked a realistic concept of
what to expect in the implementation of their projects, and that it was not
technical factors which had the greatest impact on implementation schedules.
III.        Selection of consultants and suppliers
In several sections of Part I of the PCR (Evaluation Summary;
Implementation, paras. 5.09 and 5.14; Performance of ELETROBRAS, CHESF, the
Bank, and the Government, paras. 10.02-10.04), the Bank makes a series of
observations on selection of consultant/suppliers. on the basis of CHESF and
ELETROBRAS experience gained in the purchase of EMSs, it is our view that
there were many positive aspects to the process carried out in conjunction
with ICB, and that some flexibility could be introduced in dealing with the
specific aspects of acquisition of an EMS and similar systems. Our suggestion
is that the Bank not decide this question for the moment but that it engage ir
more extensive discussions with the enterprises which received EMS funds, at
the same time seeking a method better suited to i:s own expectations and the
peculiarities of procurement by public enterprises.
In our opinion, current advances in the application of computer
and information technology to the control of industrial processes will lead to
applications for similar financing for other types of industry and not only
for power generation and transmission.
IV.         Performance of consultants and suDpliers
The work done with the consultants was satisfactorily productive
and of benefit to the projects, chiefly during the initial stages of planning
and definition of system requirements. These activities were carried out in
an atmosphere of cooperation and gave access to the consulting teams'
international experience of power generation systems and computer technology,
supplementing that of the CHESF and ELETROBRAS teams.
CHESF has provided a series of observations on its relations with
its supplier (in its "Final Project Report: CHESF Control and Supervision
System," June 1991, Section 7, pp. 28-29) which lay the blame for the delays
that affected development of the system at the manufacturing stage firmly on
the supplier's own organizational and technical problems and on the latter's
failure to abide by the terms of its contract.
V.          ExDerience with IBRD
The Bank's direct intervention in critical negotiations with the
supplier was important in preventing even greater delays in system development
at the manufacturing stage. Specifically, the Bank representative's
attendance at CHESF/supplier meetings served as an additional warranty
supporting the financid. guarantee for conclusion of the project, alleviating
the supplier's concerns in this regard; it also enabled CHESF to pressure the
supplier to be more particular in keeping to contractual deadlines and other
conditions.
Finally, the Bank's understanding of the complexity of the
projects from both the technical and administrative viewpoints, and also of



31
their special nature -- in the sense that they involved development of a
specific product for the user -- led to extension of the period of validity of
the loan, thereby guaranteeing that the project. could be continued and
concluded. We should also like to emphasize that this posture created an
atmosphere of cooperation in which CHESF, ELETROBRAS and the Bank itself can
profit from the lessons to be learned.

1/ The project had originally been envisaged as part of the loan opera-
tions in connection with the SE/NE Regional Interconnection Project.
in mid-1978M folloiwng its decision to postpone indefinitely the Inter-
connection Project, ELETROBRAS proposed that the Bank finance the pro-
ject as part of its next power lending operation in Brazil.
2/ The post-appraisal mission reviewed the status of the feasiblity study
being prepared by LIGHT and the capacity of local manufactures to furnish
SINSC components and the implications for procurement arrangements.
3/ Board presentation was delayed due to slow action on part of Govern-
ment in approving negotiated loan documents.  Underlying this delay
were the ultimately failing efforts of local manufacturers to convince
the Goverrnment to reserve bidding on computers.
4/  Bank delayed declaration of loan effectiveness until the Central Bank aban-
doned its efforts to subject Loan 1939-BR to the reserve requirements applied
to loans of commercial banks.
5/ Bank agreed to extend closing date because the economic justification
remained strong and even increased due to decreasing reliability of
the transmission system -- the result of limited investment and
financial constraints.
