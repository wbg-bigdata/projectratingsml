MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DTVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN ro NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.N.C.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR A MANPOWER TRAINING PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to Nacional Financiera,
S.N.C. (NAFIN) for US$80 million equivalent is submitted. for approval.
l'he proposed loan would be repaid over 15 years, including three years
of grace, at the standard variable interest rate.
2.       Background.  Since the onset of the 1982 financial crisis, the
Goverrment of Mexico has recognized that a return to sustainable growth
would require not only stabilization, but also far-reaching structural
reforms, including restructuring of key industrial sectors and public
enterprises, opening of the economy to international competition, and
technological modernization. Reforms initiated since that time have
already led to significant closings of inefficient enterprises and
consolidation and upgrading of facilities to improve quality and reduce
costs. The process of adjustment is expected to accelerate over the
next few years as the trade regime is liberalized. For these economic
reforms to succeed, it is now essential to expand and improve employment
services and skill upgrading through manpower traini,^O. Improved
retraining and inservice training in basic skills such as bookkeeping
and equipment maintenance techniques is needed particularly to assist
the zountry's 380,000 small-and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs), which
are taking the brunt of the economic adjustment measures but will need
to play an increasingly important role under the liberalized trade
regime. Training programs must facilitate labor mobility, meet the
special needs of workers displaced by restructuring and, in the context
of slow creation of new employment opportunities in the formal sector,
provide skills for self-employment and employmenc in the informal
sector. Th. increased demands placed on the training system as a result
of the restructuring, together with rapid growth of the v .rking age
population, present a major challenge. About 800,000 persons will enter
the workforce annually. Assisted by two Bank loans totalling US$171.0
million, the Government has taken steps since 1978 to strengthen pre-
service training, and in 1984 initiated a program for labor retraining.
Major employers have also begun to increase outlays for inservice
training for workers. Nevertheless, the supply of qualified skilled and
semiskilled labor is vastly insufficient. The main constraints on the
provision of effective employment services and training are:
(a) limited public services for registration of the unemployed,
including counselling, referral and placement In training or jobs,
insufficient retraining for unemployed workers, and difficulties in
recruiting the poorest and most needy into retraining; (b) inadequate
provision by firms, especially SMEs, for inservice training of workers,
(c) institutional shortcomings in the Ministry of Labor and Social
Welfare (STPS) and the State Employment Services (SEEs) which share the
responsibility for monitoring labor market supply and demand, planning
and implementing retraining programs, and promoting inservice training
among enterprises; and (d) insufficient and unevenly distributed
training capacity.



3.       Prolect Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to
address the above problems and assist In implementing the Government's
strategies for economic reform and adjustment by reducing human resource
constraints on growth, increasing labor productivity, and lessening the
social cost of adjustment. It would: (a) strengthen employment
services and, in particular, expand and make the existing retraining
programs for displaced and unemployed workers more effective, including
an innovative and very selective use of stipends to trainees in order to
enable the poorest of the unemployed to be retrained; (b) assist
enterprises, especially SMEs, to provide inservice training for skilled
and semi-skilled workers; (c) strengthen STPS capabilities and systems
for monitoring and analyzing labor market, manpower and training
information; and (d) increase training capacity in critically needed
specialties by upgrading existing training institutions that contract
with Government and firms to provide training.
4.       Project Description.  The proposed project would pursue the
above objecti-es through four components: (a) the employment services
and retraining component (total cost, including contingencies, US$90.3
million) would provide training for 400 staff, data processing
equipment, and related technical assistance to strengthen the State
Employment Services (SEEs); technical assistance to improve the
planning, content, monitoring and evaluation of the existing STPS-
sponsored retraining progrem and related employer participation; and
financing of training costs (including trainee stipends estimated at
US$66.0 million) of an expanded, temporary STPS retraining program for
160,000 displaced and unemployed workers; (b) the demonstration in-
service training and productivity component (US$51.1 million) would
provide financial and technical assistance to 20 Technical Support
Groups for Enterprises (GATEs), to be established by employers'
associations under cost-sharing agreements with STPS and staffed with
consultants engaged under time-limited contracts, to promote and
organize inservice training of about 75,000 workers in 5,000 targeted
SMEs employing about 200,000 workers in selected sectors and regions;
and consultant services and materials for developing promotional
activities and information on inservice training which would be provided
to enterprises through a central group called the Productivity
Information Service (SIP) and targetted at 20,000 additional SMEs with
8")0,000 employees in key regions and economic sectors countrywide.
Tnese services would complement and be coordinated witl the industrial
extension services provided by the Department of Industrial Promotion in
NAFIN under the Bank-financed Fourth Small- and Medium Scale Industry
Project; (c) the STPS institutional strengthening component (US$3.1
million) would provide staff upgrading, technical assistance and
equipment to strengthen the STPS labor market, manpower and training
monitoring and information systems and related analytical capabilities
of staff; and technical assistance for priority studies to guide the
future development of Mexico's training system, including evaluations of
costs and benefits of retraining and inservice training; and (d) the
training institutions upgrading component (US$11.5 million) would
provide complementary equipment and staff training in administration for
500 existing training institutions required to provide retraining
courses in priority areas, under contract with Government.



5.       PzoJ_ct Im lementation and Cost.  The project would be
implemented over five years. STPS would be responsible for project
tanagement, with STPS' Director General of Employment as project
director; implementation capacity has been assessed and judged
satisfactorv. Project funds would be expended under the direct control
of STPS for all components except the employment services and retralning
component; fr that component, the Government has established
procedures, acceptable to the Bank, for the transfer of project funds
from the fedei-al to the state level and for related financial control.
Ilmplemenitation of the retraining and irnservice training components would
Be guided and mionitored by the Council of Employment and Training (CET)
wthich includes representation of employers and workers, and is chaired
by the Minister of Labor and Social Welfare. The costs for operating
the GATEs would be shared equally by Government and participating
enterprises, with Bank financin6 for the Government share allocated on a
declining bea-is The total cost of the project is estimated at US$156.0
million (excluding taxes and duties of US$12.3 million) with a foreign
exchange component of US$15.0 million. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement, the disbursement forecast and the allocation of loan
proceeds are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
eventis and the status of Bank Group operations in Mexico are given in
Schedules C and D, respectiv-','. A map (IBRD-20343) is attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6838-ME, dated August 28, 1987 is being
d1stributed separately.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Within the Bank's overall
strategy to assist economic restructuring and trade liberalization in
Mexico, t e proposed project would help to raise productivity and
improve labor's capacity to respond to changing labor market
requirements. It -would complement two previous Bank loans for
strengthening preservice training (Loans 2042-ME and 2559-ME). The
first of these projects was successfully completed in 3.4 years;
½iplementation of the second is progressing well. The proposed project
is designed to support other Bank operations for industrial recovery,
trade policy adjustments, and promotion of small- and medium-scale
enterprises.
7.       Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, agreement was reached
with the Government of Mexico that it would: maintain CET as an
advisory body throughout the project implementation period; establish
the SIP and the 20 GATEs under cost-sharing arrangements with employers'
organizations according to an agreed schedule; periodically monitor
project implementation using agreed key indicators, select all
recipients of training stipends in accordance with agreed criteria and
an agreed annual program; select all training institutions to deliver
training under the project, as well as all institutions to participate
in the training institutions upgrading program, in accordance with
agreed criteria and an agreed timetable (institutions that will
participate in the first year of the project have been selected in
agreement with the Bank); commence procurement of equipment for the
first 150 institutions to be upgraded, by December 31, 1987; and
undertake a mid-term review of the project in 1989 and effect
recommended measures, taking into account the views of the Bank.

8.       Benefits.  The project would help to improve the productivity
and competitiveness of Mexican enterpriseL, especially SME8, remove
human resource constraints on growth, create more equitable access to
training and employment across regions and social strata, and ease the
social strain of adjustment. It would put particular emphasis on the
provision of retraining for workers displaced as a result of the current
economic restructuring, and would include special measures to ensure the
participation in training of the poorest of the unemployed. Initial
experience with the retraining program confirms that the large majority
of graduates of retraining find employment.
9.       Risks.  Despite the priority giien to the project by the
Government in the context of the current restructuring effort, some risks
exist. Pr,ject design includes measures to minimize these risks. They
are: (a) a possible shortfall in counterpart furds. Thia risk would be
reduced through project design, including cost-sharing by enterprises,
which provides a strong incentive for the Government to provide the
remaining counterpart funds. (For 1987, the Government has approved
adequate budget allocations, including an extraordinary allocation to meet
counterpart commitments related to a PP5). In the event that sufficient
counterpart funds would not be forthcoming in the future, however, the Bank
would have the right to reduce its share of financing; (b) change of
government priorities in connection with the change of administration in
1988. This risk would be small, given the strong interest of state
governments and local interest groups to continue project-supported
activities. The risk would be further reduced by the possibility to adjust
project design or priorities, within the agreed objectives, on the basis of
the mid-term review to be carried out by the r.ew administration in 1989;
(c) failure of graduates of the retraining programs to find productive
emplovment. This risk would be reduced through improved direction of the
program based on project-financed studies of the labor market effects of
industrial restructuring, selection of trainees in accordance with new
criteria designed to identify the most trainable and motivated candidates,
direct involvement of enterprises in the retraining programs, and effective
monitoring of the program; and (d) fai'lure of the project to motivate an
adequate number of employers, particularly in small enterprises, to
undertake inservice training at their expense. This risk would be reduced
through promotion by STPS, close involvement of firms and employers'
organizations in the planning and implementation of inservice training, and
the high quality of consultants to be retained. Experience from
establishing the first GATE ihas demonstrated strong employer interest in
the program.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
