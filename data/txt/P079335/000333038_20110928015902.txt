F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective is to assist war-affected communities to restore
infrastructure and services and build local capacity for collective action. Priority would
be given to areas not previously serviced by the government, newly accessible areas
(those which were under rebel control until January 2002), and the most vulnerable
groups within those areas.

  Key performance indicators to monitor achievement of DO are:

  1. Improved social capital and organizational development;
  2. Increased access to and use of social and economic infrastructure and services;
  3. Proportion of NSAP investments targeted at newly accessible areas;
  4. Proportion of sub-projects that reflect priorities of targeted communities; and
  5. Proportion of sub-projects operative 24 months after completion.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The project development objective is to assist war-affected or otherwise vulnerable
communities to restore infrastructure and services and build local capacity for collective
action, and assist vulnerable households to access temporary employment opportunities,
with priority given to areas not previously serviced by the government, newly accessible
areas (those which were under rebel control until Jan 2002), food insecure areas, and the
most vulnerable population groups within those areas.

that ended in January, 2002. The hostilities began in 1991, when regional actors sought to control
the diamond fields in Sierra Leone and the rest of the Mano River Basin. By the end of the war,
GDP per capita had been cut in half, and infrastructure, businesses, and much of the housing
stock were left in ruins. In September 1998, the government and the Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) agreed to peace building actions that culminated in the demobilization of all combatants
by January 18, 2002, when all parties to the conflict issued a Declaration of End of War.

2.      At the time of appraisal, Sierra Leone had the lowest Human Development Index in the
world and a GNP per capita of only US$130, compared to the average for Sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA) of US$470. Over 82 percent of the population lived below the poverty line and life
expectancy was 38 years. Infant and child mortality was high, and over a third of children and a
fourth of adults were malnourished. Access of the poor majority to food, shelter, employment
opportunities and social services were among the principal constraints to post-conflict
reconstruction, economic recovery and poverty reduction. District recovery assessments revealed
that over 340,000 houses were destroyed during the war and only 10,000 had been rebuilt. The
2000 Baseline Service Delivery Survey reported that between 65 percent and 85 percent of the
population did not have access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities. Estimates in the
most neglected communities of the "newly accessible areas", such as Bombali, suggested that
access to potable water and adequate sanitation were as low as 5 percent and 3 percent,
respectively. Widespread human rights abuses during the civil war included the forced
recruitment of children as combatants, porters and sex slaves. The war disrupted the education of
almost an entire generation of children. This greatly increased the need for the development of
strategic and tailored social service support.

Strategic Context

3.      In 2001, the country started an ambitious recovery and reconstruction program. The
Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) initiated a National Recovery Strategy (NRS), followed by
an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP). The objectives of the NRS were to create
the conditions that would consolidate peace and lay the foundations for longer-term development
through: (i) restoration of state authority; (ii) rebuilding communities; (iii) building peace and
advocating human rights; and (iv) restoration of the economy.

4.      The centerpiece of the I-PRSP was disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of ex-
combatants, resettlement and reintegration of refugees and internally displaced persons, and
rebuilding of community infrastructure. A World Bank Transitional Support Strategy (TSS)
approved in 2002 to support the implementation of the I-PRSP was developed in partnership
with the Government. The main objective of the TSS was to support the transition from post-
conflict reconstruction to sustainable poverty reduction. The TSS focused on three issues: (i)
governance (targeting institutional reform, capacity building that extends to the district level,



                                                1
enhanced participation and community-driven development activities); (ii) accelerating
economic growth; and (iii) expanding access of the poor to basic social services, infrastructure,
and markets.

5.      The National Social Action Project (NSAP) was launched in 2003 as a flagship Bank
lending instrument to support the TSS and assist war-affected communities in restoring
infrastructure and services and building collective action, especially in areas not previously
serviced by GoSL. Priority areas for NSAP focused on: (i) assisting GoSL in reducing the risk of
renewed conflict; and (ii) increasing access to basic social services, infrastructure and markets
through a community driven participatory approach.

6.      The design of NSAP was consistent with the TSS. NSAP also supported GoSL’s
decentralization strategy, including the Local Government Act of 2004. The Act outlined the
devolution of expenditure functions and provided a roadmap for future implementation in the
overall context of the country’s development and partner supported activities.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.      The original project development objective was to assist war-affected communities to
restore infrastructure and services and build local capacity for collective action. Areas not
previously serviced by the government, newly accessible areas (those which were under rebel
control until January 2002), and the most vulnerable groups within those areas were its priorities.

8.      There were five key performance indicators: (i) improved social capital and
organizational development; (ii) increased access to and use of social and economic
infrastructure and services; (iii) proportion of NSAP investments targeted at newly accessible
areas; (iv) proportion of subprojects that reflect priorities of targeted communities; and (v)
proportion of subprojects operative 24 months after completion.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification


9.      First Restructuring. Due to soaring construction costs,1 inclement weather hampering
construction work, and devaluation of the Leone,2 a second-level “adaptive? restructuring was
approved on January 3, 2008. The Project Development Objective (PDO) and three output
indicators were changed and four output indicators were dropped, per recommendations of the
April 2007 regional sector management review. These changes were as follows:

         The change in the PDO was made to ensure consistency across the PAD and the
          Development Credit Agreement (DCA). Given that the formulation of the PDO in the

    In particular under the Community Development Program component and the Shelter Program subcomponent of
    the National Social Action Project (NSAP).
2
    Additional IDA allocations were not an option given the competing demands in the country.


                                                     2
         PAD best captured the rationale and design of the project, the version of the PDO in the
         PAD was retained and the DCA was modified to be aligned with the PAD.

        Changes to the output indicators included: (i) community-based subprojects implemented
         decreased from 1,000 to 600 by project closing; (ii) housing units built decreased from
         1,700 to 1,200; and (iii) roads rehabilitated changed from 100km of feeder roads to
         200km of community access roads. The reduction in (i) and (ii) resulted from large
         increases in construction materials; for example, the NSAP mid-term review report of
         2006 quotes a significant jump in the price of cement, from Le 14,000 in August 2003 to
         Le 32,000 in March 2006, representing 128.5 percent inflation in cement price over this
         period. The change in (iii) realigned NaCSA investments with evolving beneficiary
         needs and enhanced coordination with a Bank funded feeder roads project (Credit No.
         2895-SL).

        Indicators 3e.3, 3e.2, 3d.1, 2a.4 were deleted to strengthen and streamline the M&E
         framework. These indicators related respectively to NaCSA’s performance in its Public
         Expenditures Tracking Survey (PETS) scorecard; the satisfaction of NaCSA staff and
         partners with its management performance; satisfaction of NaCSA staff with quality of
         technical assistance activities; and the level of wages in the pilot public works program.

10.     Second restructuring. Following large price increases in Sierra Leone’s staple food
items3, the Bank responded on August 18, 2008 with a $4.0 million additional grant from the
Food Crisis Response Trust Fund (FPCR TF) for the scaling-up of the Cash for Work program
that had already been piloted under NSAP: A new component was added for the Cash for Work
activities. In addition, as described below, the PDO was amended and the results framework was
modified to take account of the new component:

        The PDO was amended in the FPCR TF co-financing grant agreement to read: “the
         project’s development objective is to assist war-affected or otherwise vulnerable
         communities to restore infrastructure and services, build local capacity for collective
         action, and assist vulnerable households to access temporary employment opportunities,
         with priority given to areas not previously serviced by the government, newly accessible
         areas (those which were under rebel control until January 2002), food insecure areas, and
         the most vulnerable population groups within those areas? (revised sections in italics).

        The new indicators included:

                  (i) Outcome indicators
                       o 75 percent of targeted vulnerable households reporting positive benefits
                           from the cash for work program
                  (ii) Intermediate Outcome Indicators


3
  Food price increases reached crisis proportions in 2008, and prices of most staples continued to increase, albeit at a
slower pace, in 2009. The cost of imported rice in June 2008 was 44 percent higher compared to that in June 2007
while the June 2009 price was 7 percent higher than the preceding year. Similarly, the price of wheat flour in June
2008 was 39 percent higher than a year earlier and the June 2009 price was 62 percent higher than June 2008.


                                                           3
                   o 849,600 person-days of employment created; and 254,880 woman-days of
                     employment created
                   o At least 75 percent of households in targeted areas are aware of the cash
                     for work program

11.     Third restructuring. As staple food prices continued to rise, the Bank made available a
second additional grant of $4.0 million (of which $3.0 million from the FPCR TF, and $1.0
million from the Food Price Crisis Multi-Donor Trust Fund) on November 12, 2009. The results
framework was completely reformulated on the advice of the Africa region results monitoring
team, which noted that the results framework lacked FPCR core indicators, some of its outcome
indicators were really measuring outputs, and other indicators were difficult to measure or were
not well defined. A table explaining the changes made is included in Annex 6. Targets for CFW
indicators established under the second restructuring were raised to specify at least 1,666,160
person days and at least 499,848 woman days provided in labor intensive public works.


1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.    Target Populations included internally displaced people, professionals (teachers, health
workers), demobilized soldiers and unemployed youth, refugees, woman-headed households,
child laborers, orphans, primary school dropouts, and disabled and otherwise traumatized
persons.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

13.     Community Driven Program (CDP): Restore social and economic infrastructure and
services in war-affected communities using community mobilization and collective action to
select, implement, and maintain small-scale subprojects. Special emphasis was placed on
reaching underserved areas including communities in remote or “newly accessible areas.?

14.     Pilot and Special Programs in Newly Accessible Areas: (i) rehabilitate basic chiefdom
and district feeder roads, drainage systems, and other infrastructure through a public works
program that employs demobilized soldiers, unemployed youths, and other vulnerable groups;
and (ii) construct shelter for poor and vulnerable families in newly accessible areas.

15.     Project Management and Innovative Activities: (i) capacity building for communities,
chiefdoms, and district authorities; (ii) IEC activities; (iii) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) at-
the community, district, regional, and central levels; (iv) technical assistance for social
assessments, beneficiary assessments, risk and vulnerability work, micro-finance, financial and
technical audits, Participatory Poverty Assessment (PPAs), environmental studies, and
participatory M&E.

1.6 Revised Components

16.    As noted earlier, a fourth component supporting a scaling-up of the NSAP Cash for Work
pilot was added in August 2008 with an additional grant of $4.0 million from the FPCR TF. This



                                                4
component received further resources from a second additional grant of $4.0 million from the
FPCR TF and the FPCR MDTF. The CfW component sought to provide a short term safety net
to ease the burden on the most vulnerable populations and provide households with incremental
resources to cope, without reverting to mechanisms that would diminish their assets and human
capital base.

1.7 Other significant changes

17.     The decision was made at the mid-term review (MTR) to cancel the shelter pilot
subcomponent. Construction of housing by the two contracted NGOs was significantly slower
than expected and costs had risen well above original plans. The subcomponent was closed and
the balance was reallocated to Component 1.

18.     A reallocation of the original project proceeds was made at the time of the first additional
grant for CfW (see Table 1). The reallocation was meant to adjust expenditure categories vis-a-
vis actual utilization of the credit, in response to the Government’s request dated June 8, 2008.
This request cited the need to: (1) accommodate the increase in construction costs coupled with
devaluation of the Leone and the negative impact of the weather on construction; (2) realign its
investments with the emerging beneficiary needs; and (3) allow for strengthened coordination
with the World Bank Infrastructure Development Project (IDA Grant No. H191-SL).

19.    The closing date of the project was extended twice for a total of two years. The
extensions consisted of two one-year extensions, the first of which was requested in the August
18, 2008 additional financing, and the second in the November 12, 2009 additional financing.
The rationale for both extensions was to provide time for the implementation of the additional
CFW activities supported by the additional grants.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes




                                                 5
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20.     The project built on its predecessor, the Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation
Project (CRRP, IDA Credit 3312-SL, TF 23248). Approved in the midst of the civil war in 1999,
the CRRP, through its Emergency Recovery Support Fund (ERSF) component, catalyzed and
engaged communities using community driven development (CDD) to: (i) facilitate the transition
from conflict to peace carrying out small scale activities; (ii) contribute to modalities for future
conflict prevention by actively engaging civil society; and (iii) rebuild confidence and trust
through self help interventions. The platform facilitated re-integration through consultations in
the selection, design, implementation, and monitoring of subprojects. It contributed to
strengthening social capital formation in beneficiary communities and fostering enhanced
dialogue with local governments. It also significantly built the capacity of NaCSA, which
enabled it to take on responsibility for eventual implementation of NSAP.

21.     The Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA6) review rated the project relevance and
approach and procurement as highly satisfactory, and the other seven criteria as satisfactory.
Bank input and process were also rated highly satisfactory. The assessment recognized the
appropriateness of the community demand driven (CDD) approach in the post-conflict setting
and rated sustainability as likely given the detailed arrangements for operations and maintenance
and the strong Government and donor support. The panel’s concerns related to: (1) limited
capacity of implementing agency staff at the district level and the NGOs tasked with playing a
crucial role in guiding, strengthening and monitoring community participation, and (2) weak
regional project approval committees. These issues were addressed during subsequent missions
and adjustments were made to strengthen capacity among the stakeholders through structured
training programs delivered by NaCSA.

22.     The design took into account lessons learned from in-country expertise while utilizing
global best practice from CDD and public works programs in India and across Africa. The
project was sensitive to, and realistic about, the prevailing socio-political context. NSAP
interventions were evenly targeted at communities affected by the war including areas that were
captured and held by the RUF for an extended period. The design took advantage of the Services
and Opportunities Mapping (SOM) approach to allocate resources efficiently and equitability
across geographical areas (districts, chiefdoms, wards, and communities). A model recognized
for transparent criteria, the SOM strategy helped mitigate political and/or elite interference.


2.2 Implementation

23.     The implementing agency for NSAP and the CfW activities added in 2008 and 2009 was
the National Commission for Social Action (NaCSA). NaCSA is a semi-autonomous agency
that was transformed from an emergency post conflict program to a community driven program
in response to the immediate needs of Sierra Leone. The organization has its roots in the former
Ministry of Reconstruction, Resettlement, and Rehabilitation which transformed in 1998 the
National Commission for Reconstruction, Resettlement, and Rehabilitation (NCRRR). At the
end of the CRRP, the NCRRR became NaCSA, to recognize its evolution into a social fund. In
recognition of its performance and relevance in a post conflict fragile environment, the lifespan



                                                 6
and mandate of NaCSA were recently extended from 2008 to 2018 and to include Social
Protection and Reparations.

24.     The project was categorized as a project at risk (defined as having three or more “risk
flags?) 20044. It was never, however, considered as a problem project in terms of being judged
as having unsatisfactory implementation progress or likelihood of achieving its development
objectives. In response to the project at risk status, the client and the Bank intensified
supervision of the project. Capacity building efforts were strengthened coupled with
improvements in guidance and implementation of project processes and fiduciary arrangements,
The Shelter sub-component was cancelled and funds were reallocated to Component 1 (as noted
earlier).

25.     Project supervision was rated satisfactory by the 2006 Quality of Supervision Assessment.
At this time, QAG identified weak implementation of the shelter component and the need for
improved donor coordination. Changes to address these concerns and others identified by the
Bank and Government were made during the Mid-Term Review (May 9-18, 2006). Based on the
recommendations of the MTR, the Bank and Government: (i) restructured the project to realign
the PDO with its original formulation5 ; (ii) amended output indicators, given the 40 percent
increase in the cost of construction materials; (iii) increased authorized allocations to sub-
projects; (iv) expedited the processing of Withdrawal Applications (WA); (v) reassessed
beneficiary needs; (vi) coordinated NSAP with the roads subcomponent of the new Bank project;
and (vii) and reviewed NaCSA’s role based on an institutional assessment by Kreditanstalt für
Wiederaufbau (KfW) with a view at strengthening existing and future capacity needs.

26.     A decision was also made by NaCSA and the Bank to halt the pilot Shelter Program for
Vulnerable Groups sub-component due to poor performance. This $2.0 million subcomponent
aimed to provide basic shelter to needy households, especially those households headed by
females, amputees, and other disabled population groups as a means of supporting resettlement
and normalization of the economy in "newly accessible areas." The implementation of the
shelter subcomponent was contracted out to two NGOs, Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and
Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA). Both NGOs were selected through a
competitive procurement process. The estimated unit cost was of US$1,000.

27.      The subcomponent originally aimed to provide 1,700 shelter units, but due to a
combination of escalating construction costs and intemperate weather the target was reduced
1,200. Even with the reduced target, however, the subcomponent still showed problematic
performance. Targeting of most vulnerable beneficiaries was an issue; an assessment conducted
at MTR and subsequent discussions showed that contrary to the PAD and to project documents,
the majority of shelters did not target the most vulnerable people in communities6. The two
NGOs were unable to achieve the already reduced objective of 1,200 shelters in the three
districts (800 shelters for CRS; and 400 shelters by ADRA)—at the MTR only 908 shelters had

                                                  7
been completed or were under construction. The MTR argued that costs increases and the bad
road conditions could explain only in part this performance. Moreover, the independent
assessment on the shelter subcomponent indicated that in all three districts the materials provided
by the NGOs were in most instances below the specified requirements. On this basis, NaCSA
and the World Bank agreed to terminate this sub component. The NGOs completed those
projects among the 908 that were still under construction at the time of the MTR, and did not
receive the final tranches specified in their contracts for the completion of the full 1,200 units.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

28.     During project implementation, the key performance indicators were monitored and
tracked in the NaCSA progress reports, Bank mission reports, and in Implementation Status
Reports. NaCSA faced initial challenges working within timelines for progress reports but with
time, built capacity and functioned properly. Multiple monitoring methods were used and
adjusted consistently, based on feedback from Bank supervision missions. One such example, a
project design matrix system, became the basis of enhanced M&E for outputs and: (i) monitored
procedural compliance with the Operations Manual on implementing subprojects, executing
contracts, and managing project accounts; (ii) regularly produced data on project objectives and
budgets, and facilitated reporting to the Board of Directors and GoSL; (iii) reported on findings
from beneficiary and social assessments, annual technical audits, to be integrated into the
NaCSA procedures; (iv) incorporated NaCSA budget and expenditures into GoSL semi-annual
public expenditure tracking survey; and (v) alerted managers to actual or potential problems in
implementation, triggering timely remedial actions.

29.     Communities were involved in monitoring subprojects. A pilot participatory M&E
system was introduced in a representative sample of predominant types of CDD subprojects.
Beneficiary communities identified important quantitative and qualitative indicators that were
combined with standardized indicators to allow for comparisons between communities. These
indicators were measured and assessed over time to distill lessons learned. At Mid-Term Review,
the respective experiences were incorporated as an integral element in the CDD subproject cycle.
NSAP M&E data also fed into the GoSL’s ongoing decentralization and community
development programs financed under various programs (i.e. Islamic Development Bank’s CDD
project) and the MIS system has been linked to various Government MIS systems.

30.    Near the end of the project, the limitations of NACSA’s M&E system for CfW became
apparent as the data from sub-Project Completion Reports (PCRs) was not aggregated in one
comprehensive database allowing for full exploitation of the data on project indicators. Instead
separate databases existed for individual CfW indicators. With assistance from the Bank,
NACSA was able to hire a consultant after the closure of the project to rapidly compile CfW
sub-project data into a comprehensive database, something that in the future should be done on
an ongoing basis over the course of the project, rather than being left to the end.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

31.     An Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) was prepared in 2002 to
identify mitigation measures and a specific action plan for each type of subproject for financing.



                                                8
A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was also prepared in 2002. The documents were
validated and training was carried out in three regions for NaCSA staff and contractors in the
NaCSA database. The checklists presented in the ESMF and RPF formed the basis of the training.
This was later simplified under the CfW component.

32.     An assessment of environmental safeguards practices carried out in early February 2010
revealed weaknesses in the implementation process: (i) use of general versus project specific
checklists; (ii) inadequate technical training to address high staff and contractor turnover; (iii)
weak environmental monitoring indicators; (iv) absence of adequate number of environmental
officers for regions to liaise with local councils on a monthly basis; and (v) inclusion of NaCSA
officials in environmental committees. These issues were addressed by NaCSA through:
intensified training programs; design of simple and tailored environmental procedures and an
EIA Safeguards Manual (2009) with clear criteria and standards for screening subprojects and
putting in place workable plans for implementing mitigation measures; improvements in the
environmental monitoring indicators; increased staffing of environmental officers and
participation of NaCSA officials in the environmental committees; and more vigilant approach to
monitoring project safeguards.

33.     Very few if any instances of negative social impacts of the project came to light during
implementation; indeed one of the main rationales of the project was to rebuild the social fabric
of the country during the civil war. In this regard, the Beneficiary Impact Assessment found that
the underlying reasons for high levels of participant satisfaction had much to do with social
achievements: i.e (i) that the project reflected the collective felt needs of the community; and (ii)
that the project contributed to rebuilding social facilities necessary for social cohesion and
ultimately strengthening community relations which is needed for peace and stability7.

34.      NaCSA’s internal finance department was responsible for all financial management (FM).
Overall, the project met the financial reporting requirements of the Financing Agreement. The
bulk of financial transactions were decentralized to NaCSA’s four regional offices and ten
district offices. The omission of Management Letters and physical verification exercise of the
project sites by the External Auditors caused initial delays in submitting the WAs: Repeated
reminders of the submission deadlines by the Bank led to better planning by the project team and
the External Auditors, and financial reports (Audited Financial Statements and Interim Financial
Reports) were consistently submitted prior to the due dates and in acceptable formats. Systemic
weaknesses were improved by FM implementation support missions and open lines of
communication with the project team. Guidelines and processes complemented these
interventions and allowed for the adequate segregation of functions within NaCSA to guide the
appropriate approval and authorization of project expenditures under the Grant, including the
availability of an Accounts Manual.

35.   Procurement plans were submitted on a timely basis and procedures in the Operations
Manual were judged to be satisfactory and in compliance with Bank requirements. Bid
documentation was found to be complete, covering technical specifications, technical drawings,
and a description of the timeframe required to complete works. An isolated case of mis-

procurement led to the dismissal of contractors and the implementation of stricter monitoring
procedures, including barring contractors from future bids. Mechanisms were put in place to
ensure this risk was mitigated in the future.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

36.     Both the NSAP CDD program and the Cash for Work program are being continued with
other financing. NaCSA’s CDD program, after the decision by the Bank not to finance a follow-
on CDD project for reasons of selectivity, has been financed by the Islamic Development Bank,
which committed $18.45 million to the program in 2010. The Cash for Work program has been
scaled up under the World Bank’s $20 million Youth Employment Support project (YESP),
which contains $10 million of financing for Cash for Work implemented by NaCSA. Following
the food and fuel price rises of early 2011, the Bank and Government agreed to accelerate the
implementation schedule for CfW under YESP by frontloading resources originally intended for
2012 into 2011. This demonstrates that the CfW program has become an effective crisis
response mechanism that is capable of being rapidly scaled-up in the face of economic shocks.

37.      Arrangements for maintenance and sub-project sustainability. For NSAP CDD sub-
projects, NaCSA paid due attention to building operations and maintenance, and sustainability
into: (i) the subproject cycle; (ii) monitoring and evaluation; and (iii) integrating sustainability
issues as part of training and facilitation.

      For most projects, operations and maintenance responsibilities remained in the hands of
       the Operations and Maintenance Subcommittees of the community-based Project
       Management Committees (PMCs), reflecting the concept of community ownership. The
       PMC and its Operations and Maintenance Subcommittee worked in partnership with
       local authorities who formally committed to funding operations and maintenance as part
       of their budget.      Subcommittee members also received training on subproject
       maintenance and sustainability and sharing of experiences and lessons learned between
       graduating communities.
      A maintenance fund under NaCSA was made available from unutilized subproject funds
       (1–3 percent of investment costs). Proceeds were utilized to support activities requiring
       additional or unexpected operations and maintenance support.
      Sustainability was encouraged through: post-implementation supervision, post-
       implementation facilitation, network facilitation, training (included as part of the
       subproject budget) and follow-up on subprojects (to correct deficiencies).
      On the M&E side, ex-post technical audits were undertaken to review sustainability
       arrangements and summaries were prepared on the post-implementation sustainability
       assessments of subprojects.

38.    The Beneficiary assessment confirmed that these arrangements were in fact operational
on the ground and that the communities themselves either through their
committees/subcommittees or volunteers were managing the facilities. An interesting aspect is
that only in a few cases (6 out of 64 communities examined by the BIA) it was reported
management and maintenance were in the hands of the chiefs and elders as opposed to
community members. An exception mentioned by the BIA is the arrangements for roads


                                                10
maintenance in which other stakeholders like the Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA) and
Local Councils were involved due to the level of technical demand and resources involved in
road maintenance of the road.

39.    For CfW, maintenance of the roads rehabilitated is the responsibility of the SLRA and
Local Councils, who are being empowered by the surge in resources they are receiving in the
form of block grants from the central government (in part supported by the World Bank
Decentralized Service Delivery Project (DSDP) to take increased responsibility for roads
maintenance. Maintenance and upkeep of CfW agriculture sub-projects has been the
responsibility of youth or women’s groups.

40.    From the institutional perspective, the project played a catalytic role in building NaCSA’s
capacity as a development organization. NSAP/CfW provided the opportunity to expand
NaCSA’s role in delivering small infrastructure investments within the country’s evolving
decentralization agenda. The project also strengthened NaCSA’s capacity in community
mobilization and participatory local development planning, as demonstrated by the range of
government and donor- financed projects it currently implements. NaCSA continues to be
relevant to the implementation of the country’s social development agenda. The government has
extended the life-span of NaCSA from 2008 – 2018 and expanded its mandate to cover other
areas of intervention such as ‘Social Protection’ and ‘Reparations’ which are integral to the
government’s social development policy..


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Substantial

41.     The project’s relevance and strategic approach were rated highly satisfactory under the
Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA6) review. Over implementation, the project objectives,
design, and implementation remained very relevant to Sierra Leone’s development priorities and
to the Bank’s assistance strategy.

42.     Relevance of Objectives. The project’s objectives of restoring infrastructure and services,
building capacity for collective action, and supporting temporary employment opportunities were
highly relevant to Sierra Leone’s fragile post-conflict context. NSAP not only helped remedy
the deleterious outcomes of war, its works helped to reconcile communities, promoted a culture
of greater accountability at the local level, and created temporary employment opportunities for
youth and other groups, reducing their risk of engaging in violent or aggressive behavior.




                                               11
43.     The objectives were also fully consistent with the country’s National Recovery Strategy
and Interim PRSP, and the Bank’s 2002 TSS8 and 2005 CAS. The Cash for Work component
alone addressed three over-arching objectives of the CAS: reducing the share of the population
living in poverty, eliminating food-poverty, and reducing unemployment. “Ensuring sustainable
human development through expanding access to the basic social services and improving
coverage of the social protection needs of the poor and vulnerable,? is the first priority of the
Agenda for Change and the mainstay of NSAP activities.

44.     Relevance of Design. The project’s design integrated best practices related to CDD and
social funds, and was consistent with the Africa Region's Community Driven Development
(CDD) strategy. Given the recent legacy of the civil war the design recognized the need to
rebuild social capital through training in the use of conflict prevention/resolution techniques and
by empowering and bringing people together to participate in a project or activity that they have
identified as a key priority for their community. This was seen as a way to reduce the risk of
renewed conflict, restore confidence in government, and create the foundations for democratic
and sustainable local development. The usage of transparent criteria for geographical targeting
helped mitigate political and/or elite interference.

45.    Relevance of Implementation. As the project was implemented, it remained relevant to
the country and was flexible enough to accommodate new priorities as they emerged. This is
borne out by the two additional financing grants that were provided to scale up the pilot public
works program in response to global food price rises.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Substantial

46.     To facilitate analysis of whether the Project Development Objectives were attained, the
Project Development Objectives statement can be divided into four dimensions, each of which
will be examined in this section:

            A. assisting war-affected or otherwise vulnerable communities to restore
               infrastructure and services;
            B. building local capacity for collective action;
            C. assisting vulnerable households to access temporary employment opportunities,
               and
            D. giving priority to areas not previously serviced by the government, newly
               accessible areas9, food insecure areas, and the most vulnerable population groups
               within those areas.



8
   A Transitional Support Strategy in lieu of a Country Assistance Strategy was prepared in 2002 and covered two
   years. The Government's June 2001 Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) provided the framework
   for the TSS.

A. Assisting war-affected or otherwise vulnerable communities to restore infrastructure
and services

47.     Both Component 1 (Community Driven Program – CDP) and Component 4 (Cash for
Work – CfW) have made significant achievements in helping poor and vulnerable communities
to restore infrastructure and services. The CDP component delivered 589 of 600 planned
demand driven community subprojects in communities affected by the civil war, most of them in
“newly accessible areas? (those which were under rebel control until January 2002) and
previously un-served areas, and the most vulnerable groups within those areas (see Annex 2).
The CfW component delivered 727 road, agriculture, and environment subprojects in vulnerable
and food insecure communities. In addition, the pilot rural public works program supported
rehabilitation of 164 km of community access roads, and the shelter pilot enabled construction of
908 housing units.

48.   The impact of the project on the restoration of infrastructure and services can be
measured through four of the six principal outcome indicators for the project, all of which
showed significant positive impacts on targeted communities:

   1. People with access to improved health and sanitation facilities. 737,714 people
      gained access to improved health and sanitation facilities as a result of the infrastructure
      built under the CDP. According to the BIA, the investment in health facilities
      significantly improved access to health care given the reduction in distance, cost of public
      transportation, and time it took to access the facility. 33 percent (126 of 381) of
      beneficiaries surveyed by the BIA said they had to use public transportation to access
      health care before NSAP, compared to only 2 percent (8 of 408) after the NSAP
      intervention. The BIA also found that among women with children born before and after
      the construction of the health facility, 29 percent of the women had made two to three
      antenatal visits on behalf of their younger children, whereas only 17.5 percent had done
      the same for their older children born before the NSAP health infrastructure. The
      numbers of health staff in 43 areas sampled in the BIA increased by 88 percent (from 48
      to 92) after completion of NSAP health infrastructure.

   2. Children with access to improved education facilities. 368,136 children gained access
      to improved education facilities as a result of the infrastructure built under the CDP. Not
      only did children get access to improved schools, but the new schools built under CDP
      led to increases in enrollment (particularly among girls) and teacher staffing. For
      example, according to the BIA, in 2006 the construction of 24 schools caused overall
      enrolment to increase in the beneficiary communities from 7,921 to 9,950 students, with
      increases of 29 percent for girls and 23 percent for boys. The teacher complement in
      these schools rose by 30 percent from 132 to 172. In 2007, construction of 55 schools
      precipitated an enrolment to rise from 15,096 to 19,202 students, with increases of 33
      percent for girls and 23 percent for boys. The number of teachers in these communities
      rose by 37 percent from 289 to 395.

   3. Beneficiaries of economic infrastructure projects. 115,597 people were beneficiaries
      of economic infrastructure projects (markets, roads, agriculture, etc.) built under the CDP.



                                               13
       In addition, 579 communities benefitted from 1,150.5 km of rehabilitated roads, and 111
       communities benefitted from 960.7 hectares of agricultural land under cultivation under
       the CfW component. 164 km of roads were also rehabilitated under the rural Public
       Works pilot. The BIA sampled areas that had benefitted from construction of markets
       under the CDP and found that 96 percent of respondents were satisfied with the markets,
       and that they had resulted in decreased travel time and costs for women and a greater
       availability of a variety of goods. No evidence is available, however, on the impact on
       livelihoods of market sellers, other than anecdotal evidence presented in the BIA.

   4. Proportion of infrastructure operational 12 months after completion (Target = 90
      percent). Instead of 12 months, the project gathered data on the percentage of
      infrastructure operational 24 months after completion, a more stringent test of
      sustainability. Results show that 94 percent of sub-projects were operational 24 months
      following completion, out of a sample of 167 sub-projects sampled under the BIA. The
      sample of sub-projects covered five districts: Kambia, Kenema, Koinadugu, Port Loko,
      and Tonkolili. Data on sub-projects operational 12 months after completion was not
      available.

49.     Despite its success in reaching the outcome indicators, the project still fell slightly short
of reaching its output indicator on the number of completed CDP sub-projects. In the end, this
indicator was achieved at 98 percent of the targeted level, with the completion of 589 subprojects.
The project encountered a number of cases where contractors failed to perform up to the
obligations of their contracts, generally in terms of slow implementation performance after
having received a tranche of financing. NaCSA forwarded 18 such cases to be handled by the
Sierra Leone Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC). The Government agreed to provide
additional financing to allow completion of these sub-projects while monies were attempted to
be recovered from the delinquent contractors. However, in the end, 11 sub-projects remained in
various stages of incompleteness (though some were partially functional) due to Government’s
inability to make funding available. NaCSA has now requested Local Councils to consider
making funding available for the completion of these remaining sub-projects.

B) Building local capacity for collective action.

50.    The CDP built significant capacity in the targeted communities which in turn enabled
them to work collectively to implement sub-projects. One of the most obvious signs that this
capacity for collective action was built and effective is the completion of the 589 sub-projects,
each of which required considerable capacity and organization on the part of each community.

51.    Several output indicators measured the extent to which the project had increased local
capacity for collective action:

   -   All supported CDP communities have conducted participatory needs assessments
       and project identification using Participatory Poverty Assessment (PPA) approach
       (CDP only). This indicator was attained. All CDP communities passed through the PPA
       approach as required part of project identification. The PPAs consisted of facilitated
       community meetings where all segments of society analyzed the factors underlying



                                                14
         poverty in their community and developed strategies and priorities to reduce poverty.
         Broad participation in PPAs was ensured by large-scale communication efforts by
         NaCSA 10 . Feedback from beneficiaries in the BIA confirmed that PPAs were truly
         participatory—beneficiaries indicated that it was communities who identified projects for
         NSAP financing, and not NaCSA or local governments.

     -   Percentage of communities that have project management structures in place and
         trained community members (CDP only). As part of CDP design, after the completion
         of the PPAs, a ten-person Project Management Committee (PMC) was formed in each of
         the 600 project communities11. 21,722 community members, including PMC members
         and other beneficiaries, were trained in various skills sets that are relevant to community
         development including Poverty Assessment, Community Environmental Impact
         Assessment, Conflict Transformation, Community Animation and Mobilization,
         Subproject Cycle, Financial Management, and HIV/AIDS and malaria. According to the
         BIA, 80 percent of beneficiaries who received training rated the capacity building efforts
         as satisfactory in terms of levels of participation, content, and implementation plans. The
         skills acquired by PMC members and others will remain of tremendous use to future
         community development endeavors. In discussions with people at several project
         locations, the BIA found that committee members are now looked up to as resource
         persons to guide development activities in their locality. This is a very significant
         contribution to promoting collective action at community level, which the BIA expected
         to ultimately have positive bearing on sustaining CDP benefits.

     -   Proportion of sub-projects that reflect priorities of targeted communities and
         beneficiaries (CDP only). The BIA found strong evidence that sub-projects reflected
         community priorities. For example, about four in five respondents (83.5%) that benefited
         from investments in school buildings said they made the decisions to build schools in
         community meetings. Similarly for health sub-projects, 82% said such decisions were
         made in community meetings. In both cases, about eight percent did not know or were
         not involved, leaving about ten percent of beneficiaries in each instance who felt that
         community priorities were not sufficiently taken in to account, either because elites had
         controlled the process or NaCSA and PMCs had not adequately involved communities.
         The BIA also states that in almost every single project community, interviewees and
         focus group participants emphatically told the study team that their respective


10
   The IEC messaging was tailored to reach literate and non literate beneficiary constituencies in their local
languages and tools were devised to receive constituency feedback; communications between citizens and their
representative government were re-established. Most beneficiaries (90 percent), learned about NSAP through
community sensitization meetings facilitated by NaCSA field staff, radio announcements and jingles, and
announcements at religious gatherings.
11
   The basic functions of the PMC included: project design, planning and preparation of the project application form;
presentation of the project plans and budget at field appraisal; management and supervision of project
implementation; direct handling of and accounting for project funds; entering into contractual agreement for project
implementation on behalf of the community; direct procurement of goods, services and works; facilitating direct or
contracted employment of labor; organizing and conducting project launching and commissioning; preparing and
submitting sub-project implementation progress reports to the community and the District Office; and taking
appropriate action on contractors who are in breach of contract agreement. Members of the Committee were elected
in a democratic, transparent and participatory process involving every community member present in the PPA.


                                                         15
           communities gave full support to project activities, with their ownership being
           demonstrated particularly in supplying local construction materials as well as manual
           labor at no cost.

52.     Unexpectedly, the CfW component has also led to improved capacity for collective
action in some cases. The CfW Qualitative Assessment found that some beneficiaries (mostly
women) managed to save some of their earnings to set up small businesses, which they continue
to manage. One youth group in Kono—the Community Partnership for Development (CoPaD)—
encouraged beneficiaries to pay part of their wages received into a fund, and eventually they
were able to save Le 3,000,000 (USD 700). The group has been loaning this money to its
members, and so far the loans and interest are being repaid.

C. Assisting vulnerable households to access temporary employment opportunities

53.    Assistance for vulnerable households to access temporary employment opportunities took
place in three phases: first, in the pilot Rural Public Works program under Component 2, and
subsequently under the first and second phases of the CfW program ($4.0 million in each phase),
which were added to the project as Component 4. In total, these three phases provided
temporary employment to 42,552 people, for a total of 2,147,328 person days of work.

54.     The pilot Rural Public Works program proved very successful. Its main success, even
more important than the temporary employment it provided to 3,160 people,12 was that it laid the
foundation for scaled-up support in response to global food price increases through the FPCR-
funded Cash for Work program ($8.0 million), which was added to the project in 2008 as
Component 4. The pilot program aimed to rehabilitate community access roads, drainage
systems and other infrastructure through a public works program that employed demobilized
soldiers, unemployed youths and other vulnerable groups in the country's 3 poorest districts:
Koinadugu, Kono and Kailahun. All works were to be demand-driven and specific requests
would originate in relevant chiefdom, district or other local government authority. The request
would have to include a beneficiary contribution (minimum of 10 percent) and a maintenance
plan. The Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA) was brought in at the identification stage to
ensure a coherent approach and approved the roads to be rehabilitated.

55.     The CfW program involved labor-intensive public works in rural, peri-urban, and urban
areas. The first priority was to provide cash transfers to vulnerable individuals and households to
mitigate the effects of global food price increases, with a secondary priority being the creation of
economically, socially, and environmentally beneficial infrastructure. As such, the menu of
works was limited to ensure high labor ratios, with guidelines that a minimum of 60 percent of
sub-project expenditures must be spent on labor, to ensure significant cash transfers to program
participants. All works were demand-driven, with specific requests originating from and/or
confirmed with relevant communities, chiefdoms, districts, or other local government authorities.
Unlike the public works pilot under component 2, the activities were implemented via direct


12
     For the 3,160 beneficiaries, the pilot Rural Public Works program provided a total of 147,600 man-days of labor
     (compared to the target of 80,000). The original target of 800,000 man-days of labor in the PAD was a
     typographical error which was corrected in the first restructuring.


                                                         16
contracting of Implementing Partners (e.g., Youth/Local organizations, local contractors/artisans)
and not through Project Management Committees or LCs. The first phase (2008–2009) targeted
seven priority districts and the second phase (2009–2010) targeted all fourteen; both phases were
sequenced over three successive waves to ensure effective monitoring and supervision.

56.   The project achieved its outcome indicator linked to provision of temporary
employment opportunities:

       -    Beneficiaries of rural public works and cash for work programs (Target = 31,000).
            In total, 39,392 beneficiaries were given temporary employment under CfW phase 1 and
            CfW phase 2 (see Annex 2), and 3,160 beneficiaries worked in the pilot public works
            program under component 2, for a total of 42,552 beneficiaries. This translated into
            2,005,128 worker days of total employment for the phases 1 and 2 of CfW, and 147,600
            for the pilot rural public works subcomponent.

57.     Targeting was carried out at two levels. First, geographic selection of beneficiary
communities was based on poverty, food insecurity prevalence rates, and population13. Second,
targeting of beneficiaries was self-selecting, i.e. the wage rate was set below the market rate so
that only people who were truly in need of the modest income offered would find the
employment attractive. Further, workers were to be selected from within the locality, and only
one member from each household was eligible to participate in the program. In the case of more
potential participants than needed for each project, the contractor was to utilize a transparent
mechanism to select participants; i.e., a lottery mechanism. Given the pervasiveness of
vulnerability among youth, the fact that 75% of worker beneficiaries were youth supports the
idea that the CfW program largely targeted the vulnerable.

58.    The average cash transfer earned by a CfW beneficiary was $105. Earnings were
primarily used to purchase food for the household. Female participants utilized a portion of the
wages to pay for school and medical expenses. In a few cases, some women were able to save a

     The geographical targeting relied on the Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis (CFSVA),
     published in 2008 by the World Food Programme and the Food and Agricultural Organization. Indicators included
     poverty and food insecurity prevalence rate, population size, unemployment and malnutrition rates.

portion of their income and set up small businesses. The BIA also found that the IEC campaigns
had adequately informed target communities of such CfW details as eligibility, targeting,
implementation, and community involvement. Over 75 percent of households indicated adequate
knowledge about the CfW and requested scaling up the program.

D. Giving priority to areas not previously serviced by the government, newly accessible
areas (those which were under rebel control until January 2002), food insecure areas, and
the most vulnerable population groups within those areas.

59.    The geographical targeting mechanisms used for the CDP and CfW programs, as well as
the Rural Public Works and Shelter pilots, aimed to focus project resources on localities that had
suffered the most in terms of service delivery during the civil war, in addition to food insecure
areas. Within such areas, the project aimed to reach the most vulnerable groups. As described
below, the project successfully targeted its interventions to these areas.

60.     This dimension of the PDO statement is covered by one of the project outcome
indicators:

   -   Project investments targeted to newly accessible areas, areas previously not served,
       and food insecure areas (Target = 50 percent). For CfW, 100 percent of sub-projects
       were targeted to food insecure areas, as defined by the Comprehensive Food Security and
       Vulnerability Analysis (CFSVA) of 2008. 48.5 percent of CDP sub-projects were located
       in newly accessible areas or areas previously not served. For the overall project,
       aggregating CfW and CDP sub-projects, 77 percent of all sub-projects were targeted to
       such disadvantaged and vulnerable areas.


3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Substantial

61.     The project’s economic rate of return was not calculated because operations of this type
yield a wide range of external benefits to society that are not readily quantifiable. Moreover, the
demand driven character of the subprojects—and the fact that neither their size nor their type
was known ex ante—precluded the use of traditional methods of cost-benefit analysis. At the
subproject level, although the costs of projects are estimated at the appraisal stage by the NaCSA,
data deficiencies at the community level precluded the quantification and valuation of the wide
range of benefits and externalities generated by subprojects. Therefore, the assessment of
efficiency was focused on studying the cost-effectiveness of a few NSAP subprojects vis-à-vis
those of comparator organizations.

62.    Cost effectiveness comparisons showed that health clinic construction under NSAP was
67 percent less expensive than those constructed under EU projects and 65 percent less than
those supported under GoSL programs; the construction of NSAP classrooms that include water,




                                               18
latrines, staff quarters, and furniture was 50 percent lower as compared to the Ministry of
Education, Youth, and Sports.14

63.   There were substantial improvements in the processes for costing, implementation
completion, and on the structural quality of the projects. The time from application to approval
was reduced from 18–24 months to 6–9 months by completion, although the target was 4–6
months.

64.     The administrative cost for implementing the NSAP (including CfW) was 12 percent of
total program costs, which is comparable with other CDD operations although slightly above the
ambitious original target of 10 percent. The original target of 10 percent was realized to be
overly ambitious during project supervision because of the rise in the price of fuel, a major
operating expense of the project given the numerous sub-projects distributed over a large
geographic area. The cost of fuel rose from about Le. 6,600 per gallon at the time of project
approval to Le. 17,500 per gallon at the time of project closing, rendering the target of 10 percent
for administrative costs unattainable.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

65.     The project is rated satisfactory. The operation’s PDOs were broadly achieved, as shown
in the previous section. Restructuring led to improvements in implementation coupled with
strong support from NaCSA and Bank supervision missions. The targeting was effective in
ensuring infrastructure improvements and social services and employment opportunities under
CfW benefited the poorest communities in remote and isolated areas; the socially vulnerable
including ex-combatants, the elderly, women, and the disabled also benefited from NSAP.
Infrastructure was built at lower cost than by comparator GoSL agencies, and participatory
approaches were adopted to empower communities. Two beneficiary assessments demonstrated
strong support generated from beneficiaries and confirmation that the project significantly
improved their lives. Support to local level institutional capacity building was consistent with
GoSL decentralization and social development strategies, and improved the quality and
sustainability of community investments. The project accomplishments are consistent with Sierra
Leone’s present development priorities and current Bank strategies and goals.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
    (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

66.     Poverty Impacts. Given its primary rationale as a cash transfer mechanism, the CfW
component’s impact on poverty is simpler to measure than that of the CDP. The average transfer
for each CFW participant was $105 for two months of temporary employment. The 2003/2004
Sierra Leone Integrated Household Survey (SLIHS), which gives the most recent information on
poverty in the country, put the food/extreme poverty line at Le 1,033 ($0.34) per day and the full
poverty line at Le 2,111 ($0.69) per day. The average person's total consumption fell short of the


14
     NaCSA MIS, Ministry of Education Youths and Sports MIS, Ministry of Health and Sanitation MIS.


                                                       19
minimum consumption level necessary in order not to be poor by 27.5 percent of the poverty
line, or $72. Using these admittedly dated figures, the transfer appears to been have been
sufficient to move the average poor person above the poverty line, or assuming no other income
or means of support, to fully cover about 10 months’ expenditures at the food/extreme poverty
line and about 5 months expenditures’ at the full poverty line.

67.     For the CDP, the project’s poverty impacts relate more to non-income poverty, in terms
of the increased access provided to basic social services such as education, health care, water,
and rural roads. These impacts are detailed in section 3.2. The economic infrastructure
(markets) likely had some positive impact on livelihoods of market sellers, but there is no
empirical confirmation for this other than anecdotal evidence in the BIA.

68.     Gender Aspects. The project addressed gender in terms of female participation in
prioritization of community priorities, participation in Project Management Committees (PMCs),
provision of temporary employment under the CfW program, and in increasing girls’ access to
education. Education. The proximity of NSAP refurbished schools increased girls’ enrolment
rate by 30 percent compared with 23 percent increase for boys.15 Every PMC was required to
allocate 30 percent of the seats to women, and the BIA confirmed the average was 20-40 percent.
The CfW component’s performance in attracting and employing women was satisfactory,
meeting the CfW requirement of 30 percent participation by women. Female participation in
roads works was only 28 percent, while female participation in agriculture projects averaged 39
percent in vegetable, cassava, and groundnut cultivation. The CfW now underway under the
YESP is encouraging a higher proportion of agriculture sub-projects to increase female
participation, with a target of 40 percent of beneficiaries being women.

69.     Social Development. The project played a significant role in building social capital,
empowering communities through training in conflict resolutions, rebuilding trust, cohesiveness,
and shared beliefs, fostering collective action in planning and implementation, and anchoring
active community engagement in the overall decentralization process and social development
process. Over 90 percent of the beneficiaries found the consultation process useful in building
social capital and enabling communities to better understand the project and their respective
roles; the same percentage noted that the project also fostered a democratic grassroots process
and built trust between community members. Four in every five respondents benefiting from
investments in schools buildings confirmed the decision making process was conducted publicly
and openly according to project guidelines. Similarly for health subprojects, over four fifths
noted that decisions on the selection of health subprojects were made in open community
meetings. The BIA also confirmed that the participatory community demand driven approach
allowed communities to play a proactive role in conducting social audits and monitoring
procurement and financial management.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

70.    The project played a key role in building up NaCSA’s institutional capacity at the central,
regional, and district levels on all aspects of project implementation. Additional staff were

     BIA, August 2010.


                                               20
recruited at the central level and each of the four regional offices to coordinate NaCSA’s
capacity building efforts. NaCSA’s capacity was strengthened over time in order to
accommodate its role as a key agency for undertaking community development and capacity
building at the local government level thus supporting GoSL decentralization and poverty
reduction strategy.

71.     NaCSA played a key role in developing community capacity especially in post conflict
areas to prioritize activities, plan, appraise, set budgets, elect community Project Management
Committees (PMC), manage resources, and implement subprojects. NaCSA provided the most
grassroots-based platform for decision-making relative to other existing interventions. This
signaled a departure from the ERSF model that was largely driven by implementing partners
such as NGOs. Capacity building strategies were introduced to strengthen linkages with line
agencies and ensure consistency with sectoral norms, policies, and technical standards as well as
operations and maintenance. To support GoSL’s decentralization strategy, district technical
teams received training and support from NaCSA to promote local participatory planning,
community training and subproject appraisal, and monitoring and evaluation.

72.     Capacity building activities included: (i) training for local government 16 technical
departments and local service providers to enable them to better monitor and manage subproject
implementation, supervision, and maintenance; (ii) capacity building for local governments to
strengthen participatory planning, conflict transformation, community animation and
mobilization, subproject cycle, and financial management; (iii) capacity building for community
groups to improve processes of civic engagement using PPA, the subproject cycle, conflict
resolution, financial managements, HIV/AIDs and malaria, and community environmental
impact assessment; and (iv) training for NSAP staff to improve their capacity in areas
community development, supervision of tenders, new construction techniques, quality
enhancement, subproject supervision, monitoring and evaluation.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)


3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

73.        A summary of the BIA is provided in Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

74.    The risk to sustainability of the development outcomes is rated Moderate. Both CDP and
CfW sub-projects benefitted from substantial planning during design and implementation in
regard to maintenance arrangements. Projects reflected well the priorities of communities, and



16
     District and chiefdom authorities also gained experience in implementing supporting and overseeing community
     development activities as outlined in the PAD.


                                                        21
their ownership is an asset that will ensure their continued involvement in the maintenance and
upkeep of infrastructure built under the project.

75.    For CDP sub-projects, operations and maintenance responsibilities are in the hands of the
Operations and Maintenance Subcommittees of the community-based Project Management
Committees (PMCs), reflecting the concept of community ownership. The PMC and its
Operations and Maintenance Subcommittee worked in partnership with local authorities who
formally committed to funding operations and maintenance as part of their budget.
Subcommittee members also received training on subproject maintenance and sustainability and
sharing of experiences and lessons learned between graduating communities. The Beneficiary
assessment confirmed that these arrangements were in fact operational on the ground and that the
communities themselves either through their committees/subcommittees or volunteers were
managing the facilities. A sample of 167 sub-projects in five districts found that 94 percent were
operational 24 months following completion.

76.    For CfW, maintenance of the roads rehabilitated is the responsibility of the SLRA and
Local Councils, who are being empowered by the surge in resources they are receiving in the
form of block grants from the central government (in part supported by the World Bank
Decentralized Service Delivery Project (DSDP) to take increased responsibility for roads
maintenance. Maintenance and upkeep of CfW agriculture sub-projects has been the
responsibility of youth or women’s groups.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

       (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
       Rating: Satisfactory

77.     The Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA6) review rated the project design and
implementation arrangements as satisfactory, with multiple indicators being highly satisfactory.
Following the review, missions and structured training programs delivered by NaCSA
strengthened the capacity among identified stakeholders to address the concerns raised in the
QAG review about: (i) limited capacity of implementing agency staff at the district level and
among NGOs guiding, strengthening, and monitoring community participation; and (ii) weak
regional project approval committees.

78.     The project’s design took into account lessons from previous projects in the country,
region, and elsewhere. Appraisal of the commitment of GoSL, the implementing agency, and
potential beneficiaries for the tasks was prepared thoroughly. Technical aspects were carefully
examined, as were the fiduciary elements. Links with other Bank projects, GoSL agencies, and
donors were consistently integrated during implementation. The World Bank team worked
closely with colleagues in transport and urban development to forge a coherent approach with
ongoing as well as forthcoming infrastructure projects financed by the Bank and other partners.
The team coordinated with Ministries of Education, Science and Technology, health and
Sanitation, Development and Economic Planning, Agriculture and Food Security, Sierra Leone



                                               22
Water Company, Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA), and Minister of Local Government and
Rural Development to ensure complementarity and synergies among the support of NaCSA
(rehabilitation) and sectoral ministry (school teachers, health workers, textbooks, and medical
supplies).

           (b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
           Rating: Satisfactory

79.    Project supervision was rated satisfactory by the 2006 Quality of Supervision Assessment.
At this time, QAG identified weak implementation of the shelter component and the need for
improved donor coordination. Changes to address these concerns and others identified by the
Bank and Government were made during the Mid-Term Review (May 9-18, 2006).

80.     The team was correct to recognize the need to close the shelter component at the time of
the MTR, given the poor performance in this pilot program up to that point. The Bank also
performed quickly and responsively to the need for additional financing in response to the food
and fuel prices rises in 2008-2009 by preparing the two additional financing packages to support
CfW. Supervision missions identified linkages to GoSL programs and future activities 17
leveraging NaCSA’s institutional capacity and emerging country needs. The Bank team
prepared detailed Aide-Memoires and good quality Implementation Status and Results reports
alerting management to potential challenges and proposing adequate solutions.

81.    Following the decision by the Bank (as reflected in the FY10-FY13 Joint Assistance
Strategy) not to continue support for CDD in Sierra Leone, the Bank team was concerned that
the implementation capacity and mechanisms to ensure community participation would be lost.
The team alerted the Islamic Development Bank of the possibility of taking over support for the
Community Development program, and then worked with them to ensure a smooth transition of
support. This action ensured the sustainability of the project over the medium-term.

82.     Fiduciary and safeguards issues were well supervised and never became major problem
areas. The Bank team and management worked hard but without success to encourage the
Government to disburse its counterpart funds. By the end of the project, only $2.0 million of the
planned $3.5 million of counterpart funds was disbursed. Given the Bank’s limited control over
this area, though, the team cannot be faulted too much for this outcome. The impact of the
shortfall in counterpart funding was not as severe as it could have been due to the exchange rate
gains experienced by the SDR-denominated IDA credit.

           (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
           Rating: Satisfactory

83.      Based on (i) the positive ratings for Quality at Entry and Quality of Supervision by QAG,
(ii) the technical soundness and relevance of the design; and (ii) the Bank team’s flexibility and
responsiveness in scaling-up the pilot Public works program through the two additional grants

after Sierra Leone suffered from exogenous shocks, the Bank’s overall performance is rated
satisfactory.


5.2 Borrower Performance
       (a) Government Performance
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

84.     The government maintained its commitment to the project during implementation, and
was proactive and cooperated fully with the task team during the restructuring process and the
design of the two CfW additional grants. There was systematic consultation and coordination
between SLRA, the relevant Ministries and NaCSA during the design and implementation of the
subprojects as well as frequent consultations with the donor community supporting the GoSL
development strategy. Sustainability arrangements were ensured through strong Government
support and the 11 subprojects from NSAP operations were financed through the Government’s
budget.

85.     Financial accountability was maintained and follow-up and expenditures were authorized
in a timely manner once the issue of delays related to WAs was addressed. The project met the
financial reporting requirements of the Financing Agreement. There were initial submission
delays in the first few years, but, once resolved, submission of the financial reports (Audited
Financial Statements and Interim Financial Reports) have been consistent (submitted prior to the
due dates).

86.     However, the Government did not follow through on its commitment to provide funding
for the stalled NSAP sub-projects that were referred to the ACC, leading to the CDP’s failure to
reach 100 percent completion of the 600 sub-projects. Early in the project, the Government’s
difficulty in providing its agreed counterpart funding also created difficulties in implementation.
This was systematic issue across World Bank projects in Sierra Leone at the time. In the case of
NSAP, it was a particular problem because NaCSA was excluded from the Government’s
budgeting process, leading to difficulties in ensuring that the counterpart funds were included in
the budget. The shortfall in counterpart funds reached about $1.5 million over the life of the
project, though the impact of this shortfall was more than made up for by exchange rate gains
experienced by the project. While recognizing the fiscal pressures faced by the Government in
the post-conflict period, the difficulties in disbursing committed funds is the primary reason for
rating Government’s performance moderately satisfactory.

       (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
       Rating: Satisfactory

87.     NaCSA was instrumental in supporting the GoSL peace consolidation process through
the implementation of the decentralized “partnership? approach which transferred responsibility
for project identification and implementation to communities and transformed the role of NaCSA
and intermediaries such as NGOs, community based organization, and GoSL agencies to that of
a facilitator; built social capital through community empowerment and training in the use of




                                                24
conflict prevention and resolution; created temporary employment and provision of basic
infrastructure rehabilitation to war affected communities.

88.     Despite staffing challenges during the early years of project implementation,18 NaCSA
was able to re-group and play a critical role in strengthening the capacity of local governments as
well as community groups and mainstream current programs with new approaches while
ensuring full integration with GoSL programs. The NaCSA team was proactive in responding to
changes (closing the Shelter sub-component and requesting a re-allocation of funds) and external
shocks (food price crisis) while working under intensive pressure as a result of the escalating
needs. It successfully coordinated with various agencies despite initial challenges given the post
conflict context. They carried out their work in a professional manner under difficult
circumstances and were responsive to recommendations emerging during Bank supervision
missions designed to strengthen implementation. NaCSA established itself as a credible
implementing entity with demonstrated competence in the delivery of technical, managerial, and
organizational support to the communities and local governments. The findings of the BIA
carried gave the project positive feedback on the quality of services and commitment to work.

89.     NACSA’s major accomplishment, for which it deserves a satisfactory rating, was the
leading role it played in ensuring the project’s physical targets, as well as full loan disbursement,
were achieved by the closing date while adhering to transparent fiduciary and procurement
guidelines. One shortcoming highlighted in the last ISR indicated that project management was
downgraded due to moderately satisfactory due to the overrun of the budget for the final phase of
CfW by the NaCSA team. NaCSA was eventually able to make up the shortfall by using its own
funds, and by shifting some staff salary expenses to the Youth Employment Support project,
which had also absorbed much NaCSA staff time since its signing on July 20, 2010, though this
time had previously only been supported by CfW. Despite this budget difficulty, NaCSA’s
overall performance was strong and critical to the operation’s ability to meet all of its targets in
regard to its outcome indicators.

90.     Another area with room for improvement was in regard to monitoring and evaluation.
NaCSA was not able to aggregate the data from CfW sub-Project Completion Reports (PCRs) in
one comprehensive database allowing for full exploitation of the data on project indicators. Such
a database should have been continuously updated to allow for real-time tracking of key project
indicators and permit analysis of emerging trends. Instead separate databases existed for
individual CfW indicators. With assistance from the Bank, NACSA was able to hire a consultant
after the closure of the project to rapidly compile CfW sub-project data into a comprehensive
database, something that in the future should be done on an ongoing basis over the course of the
project, rather than being left to the end.

borrower performance is also rated moderately satisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned

92.    Importance of pre-existing, scalable safety nets for crisis response. The pilot rural
public works program proved very useful in laying the foundation for IDA to respond promptly
to evolving country priorities and scale up safety nets support in the face of shocks. This
underscored the importance of having scalable safety nets systems in place before the onset of
shocks in order to respond effectively and in a well-targeted manner.

93.    Counterpart funding. In fragile states, requiring counterpart funding from Government
can be counter-productive, especially when other forms of ensuring government ownership are
possible. Government provision of counterpart funding became a problem soon after the project
commenced, as noted in the 2005 CPPR. Government displayed other signs of ownership, and
implementation would have proceeded more smoothly with 100 percent Bank financing.

94.     Importance of capacity building and community participation in identifying,
managing and monitoring subprojects in post conflict environment. The implementation of a
sustained and tailored capacity building program was important in fostering community
participation with local government in all stages of the subproject cycle in a post conflict
environment. The creation of Project Management Committees (PMCs) served as a catalyst in
mobilizing communities to effectively participate and perform their oversight and monitoring functions.
This in turn strengthened a sense of ownership and led to sustained support to operations and
maintenance.

95.     Promoting cohesiveness and rebuilding trust. The restoration of infrastructure and
essential services, in addition to their own merits, also generated social benefits by promoting
cohesiveness, rebuilding trust and fostering community engagement.

96.     There is an important role for institutions like NaCSA in low-income, post-conflict
states. NaCSA proved a good alternative to NGO execution of development and recovery
activities in Sierra Leone. From the institutional perspective, the project played a catalytic role
in building NaCSA’s capacity as a relevant development organization. The project provided the
opportunity to expand NaCSA’s role in delivering small infrastructure investments within the
country’s evolving decentralization agenda. The project also strengthened NaCSA’s capacity in
community mobilization and participatory local development planning, as demonstrated by the
range of government and donor- financed projects it currently implements. NaCSA continues to
be relevant in the development paradigm of the country’s social development agenda and has
become a conduit for donor funds as witnessed by its continued engagement and implementation
of new CDD operations in the country.

97.     Strong coordination among donors can be critical to ensure sustainability. When the
Bank decided not to provide follow-on support for CDD in Sierra Leone for reasons of
selectivity, good coordination with the Islamic Development Bank enabled continued support for
this program which was an important engine of development in the country, both in terms of


                                                  26
building social infrastructure and empowering communities. Without another donor to pick up
support for the program, the potential for the CDP to continue supporting Sierra Leone’s
development would have been lost.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The economic and financial viability of the project is based on an analysis of cost-
effectiveness of NSAP interventions, especially infrastructure sub-projects. The demand driven
character of the subprojects—and the fact that neither their size nor their type was known ex
ante—precluded the use of traditional methods of cost-benefit analysis. At the subproject level,
although the costs of projects are estimated at the appraisal stage by the NaCSA, data
deficiencies at the community level precluded the quantification and valuation of the wide range
of benefits and externalities generated by subprojects. Therefore, the assessment of efficiency
was focused on studying the cost-effectiveness of a few NSAP subprojects, time taken to
complete the sub-projects and allocative efficiency.

2.      Cost efficiency. On the basis of this analysis, NSAP cost comparisons for health clinic
construction was 67 percent lower than those constructed by the EU and 65 percent lower than
those supported under GoSL.20 Other measures of cost-effectiveness included the costs per
beneficiary for education infrastructure, as well as the overhead or administrative costs of sub-
project delivery. On the cost per beneficiary for education infrastructure, NSAP classrooms cost
about US$ 37.51 per beneficiary which is lower when compared to costs per beneficiary in
countries such as Malawi US$(167)21, and Northern Uganda (US$326.86)22 . On the overheads
or administrative costs, NSAP overhead cost was estimated at 10 percent and CfW portion
totalled 13. 5 percent of total program costs, which is comparable with other CDD operations.

3.     Time taken to complete the sub-projects. There were substantial improvements in the
processes for costing, implementation completion, and on the structural quality of the projects.
The time from application to approval was reduced from 18–24 months to 6–9 months by
completion, although the target was 4–6 months.

4.      Allocative efficiency. Allocative efficiency reflects consumer preferences and demand
through a participatory, community planning approach used to identify investments. Experience
with social fund/CDD operations in Latin America and Nigeria where communities generally
choose investments which can be expected to have a high rate of return such as health and
sanitation and feeder roads. This was the case in NSAP, where 51 percent of investments were
allocated to feeder roads, 18 percent to education with 14 percent to health and sanitation and
agriculture productivity respectively and 3 percent to agricultural activities.

5.      All these indicators support the fact, notwithstanding the comparative challenges, NSAP
projects were delivered more cost-effectively compared to other similar sub-projects. Moreover,
sustainability of many sub-projects under NSAP is higher due to greater involvement of the
beneficiaries in the entire sub-project cycle which enhances their ownership.

                     Summary of the August 2010 Beneficiary Impact Assessment

     Objectives: The main objectives of the August 2010 BIA were to: (a) evaluate the achievement
     of the project’s objectives, specifically: (a) establishing and strengthening social capital in war
     affected areas; (b) targeting of NSAP investments into newly accessible and food insecure areas;
     (c) NSAP and CfW’s role in mitigating the risk of renewed conflict; and (d) increased
     community access to social and economic infrastructure. In addition, the BIA assessed
     beneficiary satisfaction with NSAP and undertook a survey of the Cash for Works component.

     Selection and Methodology: A total of 90 sub-projects were selected from 600 CDP sub-
     projects implemented in the country, representing 15% of the total intervention. For CfW, 52
     projects were selected out of 347 implemented projects, accounting for 15% of the total.

     The sampling design involved a two-stage cluster sampling, using random techniques. The study
     utilized primary and secondary data to generate findings. Secondary information entailed a
     review of existing documents, while primary data involved collecting information and data from
     relevant project stakeholders including beneficiaries, Both qualitative and quantitative
     methodologies were employed to solicit primary data. Quantitative data was obtained by
     administering 1,683 questionnaires to households in the beneficiary communities. Qualitative
     data was gathered using a variety of instruments including an observation checklist, in-depth
     interview and focus group discussion guidelines. The quantitative data was analyzed using
     Statistical Packages for Social Scientists (SPSS), while qualitative in depth interviews and focus
     group discussions were entered into Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for analysis.

     Key Findings: Over 78% of all respondents said that the project intervention was satisfactory
     and had resulted in a significant positive change in the living conditions of their community. The
     project was also seen as having a positive impact on strengthening dialogue between local
     governments and communities.

I.      Key Findings Organized by Four NSAP Objectives


        A. Establishing and Strengthening Social Capital for War Affected Areas

     The study found substantial evidence that NSAP design as well as implementation arrangements
     contributed to building social capital in intervention areas. For example, the project design
     emphasized participatory planning and management of NSAP interventions, which were largely
     achieved.

     The creation of Project Management Committees (PMCs) catalyzed community participation.
     PMCs were tasked with oversight and monitoring functions as well as operations and
     maintenance of sub-projects. Participatory processes also deepened community ownership.
     Several members of PMC moved into prominent and leadership roles and youth groups formed



                                                     34
   monitoring groups in their communities. The chairman of the PMC at Bunumbu, Peje West in
   Kailahun district became the focal person for development interventions in the community. At
   Newton, the chairman of the PMC is the current parliamentary representative for that
   constituency and another member is the councilor. Youth at Sembehun, a town in the Bo district,
   southern Sierra Leone established a Development Monitoring Group to follow up on
   development interventions in their communities.
   NSAP required standard procurement and contracting procedures to be applied to all projects.
   Despite a number of complaints coming from communities including dissatisfaction with hiring
   non-locals contractors, the study generally found the PMC and implementation arrangements to
   be satisfactory and in the best interest of the communities. Councils and NaCSA field staff, (two
   key players at the institutional level), expressed satisfaction with the way NSAP was planned and
   implemented.


B. Targeting a Significant Proportion of NSAP Investments into Newly Accessible and Food
   Insecure Areas

   According to the BIA, NSAP CDP interventions were evenly distributed among all 13 districts.
   About two-third (65 percent) of CDP projects were in health and education infrastructure, while
   CfW projects were focused on feeder road rehabilitation and agricultural support. In districts cut
   off as a result of siege by rebels, NSAP interventions were specifically targeted to benefit
   communities affected by the war.
   Communities were well informed about NaCSA and the agency’s contribution to rebuilding the
   post war infrastructure of the country, even though few residents in beneficiary communities
   view NaCSA as another NGO.


C. Mitigating the Risk of Renewed Conflict


   Under the NSAP CDP component, the availability of community Barrays and community centers
   contributed to reducing human rights abuses and the number of “Kangaroo? or illegal courts
   which served as channel for these abuses. In the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)
   report, the issue of Kangaroo courts and illegal fines was highlighted as one main reason for the
   escalation of the conflict. With the reduction of the Kangaroo (illegal) courts, violations were
   reduced as was renewed conflict in these areas.

   The CfW program also contributed to mitigating risk of renewed conflict. CfW provided
   avenues to keep youth off the streets, and provided them and their families with income for the
   duration of the program. Focus group discussants were asked whether the income earned from
   the CfW helped reduce conflict within the community. Beneficiaries, in the Kono district and in
   the Western Area, were convinced CfW provided an avenue for mitigating conflict in the
   community. According to the focus group, in the Western Area, direct beneficiaries were busy
   with the work, which left them with little time engage in a fight. The group also revealed that
   CfW guidelines stipulated that beneficiaries who engaged in any form of violence would no
   longer be eligible to work in the CfW program. According to the beneficiaries, this condition
   averted unwarranted conflict in the beneficiary communities.

    D.        Increasing Community Access to Social and Economic Infrastructure


    The NSAP assets provided services previously missing in the beneficiary communities, and
    increased user access to these services. The education sector for example noted substantial
    progress in Class I enrolment across communities where school construction was undertaken.
    Between 2006 and 2007, enrolment for girl increased by about 30 percent. Likewise, the survey
    undertaken for this assessment found that about a third of respondents had at least one girl child
    in school. Another wider impact that emerged from NSAP is communities which received health
    infrastructure support also reported.

    The data provided suggests more children enrolled in the nearby primary schools after schools
    were refurbished under NSAP. The enrolment rate for girls increased by about 30%. In parallel,
    the number of teachers increased. The data showed an average of 34% increase in staffing
    between 2006 and 2007.
    Respondents with children between the ages of 6-13 years (primary school age) were asked
    whether girls and boys were currently attending the school constructed by NSAP. Likewise
    respondents were also asked about school attendance prior to the construction of NSAP
    supported schools. The findings displayed in Figure 1 suggest that school attendance for the girls
    increased significantly in the project locations across all districts following the construction of
    NSAP supported schools. Of 474 respondents interviewed, 37.3% had at least one girl attending

an NSAP constructed primary school, compared to 19.2% prior to the construction of the school.
Attendance for boys also increased following the NSAP supported school sub-project. The
proportion of respondents with boys in a primary school rose from 27% to 33.2%.

One reason for the increase was attributed to the reduced walking distance to schools. Prior to
the construction of NSAP schools, children spent an average of two hours to access the nearest
primary school.

    2. Health Infrastructure
Improvements in access to health care. The general trend shows a progression in the number of
users accessing NSAP financed health facilities. The data in Table 2 suggests that household
residents were more likely to seek health care from a facility constructed by NaCSA when a
family member was sick. Female beneficiaries in Laiya, Bombali district said: “We are utilizing
the health centre, because now when people are sick, we take them to the health facility.?
Utilization of NSAP supported health facilities was highest for the Port Loko district and lowest
for Koinadugu district, probably due to the difficult terrain in Koinadugu district.

Prior to the NSAP intervention, communities relied on public transport to reach a health facility.
The number of respondents who used public transportation prior to NSAP support dropped from
33% (126 of 381) to 2% (8 of 408). (See Figure 2). As a result of the NSAP intervention,
approximately 98% of the women were able to walk to the NSAP health facility and only 2%
used public transportation compared to 33% prior to the construction of the health facility.

 Increased utilization of health facility for ante natal care: The National health sector strategic
plan23 calls for pregnant women to make at least four visits to a health care facility to receive
antenatal care, in order to track the progress and monitor the health status of the child and mother.
However, many pregnant women were unable to make four visits to health facilities during the
course of the pregnancy due to the high costs associated with transportation. Following the

completion of the NSAP health facility, there was evidence of an increase in the number of
antenatal visits for the younger children. About a third (29%) of women made 2-3 antenatal
visits for the younger child compared to 17.5% for the older child. (Figure 3)

The waiting time to see a health professional for pregnant women and other clients was reduced
as a result of the improved staffing situation in NSAP supported facilities. Table (3) shows data
summarized by NaCSA showing the change in staffing situation for 43 supported NSAP health
facilities.

    3. Water Wells and Toilets
Four communities with water and sanitation projects were sampled. Findings from the study
confirmed an increase in the availability of safe drinking water. However, the BIA also noted
that other sources of drinking water were being used concurrently given the overwhelming
demand for consumption of water.

    4. Shelter
A total of thirty three housing units were built by the project in Tumbudu community, Kono
district. The majority of beneficiaries were satisfied, as the houses protected them from the
harshness of weather conditions including rain and sunshine. Perhaps the most important
outcome that beneficiaries attributed to the shelter project was an increase in housing units that
has in turn contributed to reduction in overcrowding.


                  5. Court Barray and Community Centres




                                                                          40
The majority, (92% of 75 respondents) were satisfied with the court barray and community
centre sub-projects. More women were satisfied than men and there was no difference between
youth and older respondents on this issue. It was evident from interviews and discussions with
beneficiary communities that both interventions led to positive outcomes in their communities.
Communities acknowledged the availability of court barrays allowed them to move away from
the kangaroo system of deciding cases and turned to the court barrays to settle matters. Over
85% of respondents reported that the courts were the principal forum for resolving serious
disputes in their communities. Communities noted that as courts were becoming more functional
and effective, they were beginning to see a gradual decrease in human rights abuse which in turn
promoted peace and supported stability in their communities The focus group participants in
Saahun Kpaka, Pujehun district expressed deep satisfaction in their court barray:
“We use the court barray for many purposes, such as to settle disputes, community meetings, and
disco, receive guests, etc. Before now we use to hold meetings in the mud house that was used, or
we go to the school field and fence it right round… The court barray can now hold all of us in
this community under one roof; it has brought respect to us as a community when dignitaries
visit us. We are quite happy. We promised to maintain the facility though it has not been
officially handed over to the community. Some of our brothers and children living in other places
have promised to help us with the maintenance.?
The sentiment expressed for outcome on court barray intervention is quite similar to the one for
community centres in many parts of the country. For example, in Newton, Western Rural, focus
group participants cited that one profound outcome of the NaCSA built community centre is its
contribution to peace and stability through creating a platform for social functions including
wedding parties, and other social gathering. The community centres created a forum where
people could mingle and network in a sociable and amicable environment. A community in
Kambia said the centre had given them hope for good things to come.

    6. Markets
Three markets sites were visited. About 96% of 101 respondents that resided in communities
where these markets had been constructed expressed satisfaction with the intervention. 94 of
those respondents said they often visited the market centres, with 80% of them saying they came
to the market to buy or sell. Not surprisingly, the study found that of the 94 persons who visited
the market, the majority were women (92%).
The most important outcome from this intervention was the increased access to market facilities.
Another benefit was the increased range of products available locally in the markets and the
ability of beneficiaries to access products locally. This in turn reduced the time and costs
required for people to travel long distances to obtain these products. The study was unable to
measure a direct improvement in the income situation of households selling products in markets.
However, from discussions with a number of women, it was evident that an improvement in their
financial situation had been realized. This in turn could translate into improved income for their
families and improved social status in their respective communities.
II.     Coherence between NSAP Sub-projects and Beneficiary Priorities and Community
Participation in Planning and Implementation
Focus group sessions in almost every community visited confirmed CDP sub-projects reflected
beneficiary priorities and community involvement in the planning and implementation processes.
As reflected in the BIA report, there was a significant number of sub-project beneficiaries who
confirmed that target communities were trained in Participatory Poverty Assessment which



                                               41
formed the basis for the identification and prioritization of the various community needs (see
Table 4, a typical example of the way in which decisions were arrived at in the selection of sub
projects). Beneficiary communities, chiefdom and district authorities received capacity building
training in planning and implementation. The Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) were
contracted to provide NSAP’s community mobilization and facilitation training programs. For
each CDP sub-project, a Project Management Committee (PMC) was created and trained in
handling the overall implementation of the sub-project. The majority (80%) of respondents
selected beneficiary communities confirmed that the capacity building packages provided under
NSAP were successful. Table 4 provides findings on fora in which decisions were reached
regarding the financing of school and health facilities; these two interventions account for nearly
two third (65%) of all CDP sub-projects.

   1. The Project Management Committee and Project Implementation
By design, NSAP entrusted some of the project management responsibility to the communities
through the establishment of PMCs. The BIA confirmed that a PMC was established at the
beginning of the sub-project cycle. The appointment of members was done in a democratic
manner, as required by NaCSA. The selection followed a set of transparent guidelines and
eligibility criteria which included the size, functions, composition and role of PMC members.
Women were elected to fill positions and participation was open to those of varying degrees of
literacy. Local authorities including chiefs and department/section heads were excluded from
participating as committee members.

  2. Community Contribution to CDP Deliverables
In almost all sub-projects community members, household respondents as well as focus group
participants confirmed that their respective communities provided support to sub-project
activities. In Tawuya, Kambia district, participants said:
“As women, we fetched water, gathered stones, cooked for the workers, and did other light work.
Our men provided unskilled labor.?


                                                42
A similar comment was made from Kaponpon, Koinadugu district:
“The community transferred local materials such as stones, sand and sticks. The community also
provided food for the workers.?
In Yabaima, Kenema district, the community recalled their contribution to the project: “We
reside in this town in unity and for that reason we gave our full support to the project. Every able
man and woman in this village was involved in gathering local building materials and
transporting these to thesite. Young men also provided manual labor without pay.?

  3. Ownership of Sub-projects by Beneficiary Communities
As a result of active community participation throughout the sub-project cycle and NSAP’s
responsiveness to community needs beneficiaries expressed satisfaction with the NSAP project.

  4. Quality and Sustainability of Completed Sub-projects
The BIA survey confirmed that 80% of the project facilities sampled were in good or acceptable
state. The remaining 20% of facilities required additional follow up, ranging from maintenance
and repairs for incinerators in health centers and water supply components. NaCSA was quick to
respond to these shortcomings and in partnership with local councils, provided the requisite
repairs needed.

  5. Projects Operative Two Years After Completion
For the five districts (Kambia, Kenema, Koinadugu, Port Loko, and Tonkolili), out of a 167
projects financed between 2004 to 2006, 157 of them were operational two years following
completion, accounting for 94% achievement rate for this indicator.

 6. CDP Contribution to Capacity Building and Promotion of Trust and Collective
     Action in Beneficiary Communities
In addition to providing demand driven basic infrastructure NSAP supported community
empowerment, and strengthened community capacity to undertake collective action. As noted
during focus group discussions, communities confirmed the skills they acquired were relevant
to future community development initiatives. Focus group participants indicated their
respective communities gave full support to sub-project activities, particularly in supplying
local construction materials as well as manual labor at no cost. This form of contribution
promoted collective action at community level and a strong sense of ownership.

 III. Cash for Works
The BIA sampled 15% (52 sites) of CfW projects across all seven districts. The study confirmed
beneficiaries were aware of CfW’s objectives, including the selection processes, gender
considerations, focus on youth, project implementation arrangements, payment mechanisms, and
conflict resolution approaches. Many learned about the program through the radio and
networking with other community members. In Kono, a group learned about the CfW program
through information displayed on the NaCSA office notice board.
CfW sub-projects were demand driven, reflecting community priorities and reflecting CfW
guidelines.

   1. Beneficiary selection including Gender Considerations




                                                43
There were two different approaches adopted in selecting beneficiaries. Beneficiary communities
in Bombali, Kono and Western Area, confirmed that workers were actually drawn from the
community. In contrast in Bo and Moyamba districts, the communities indicated that direct
beneficiaries were recruited from outside the community. There is convincing evidence that
efforts were made to recruit women for the implementation of CfW sub-projects, which is
consistent with project design. The approximate ratio of women to men workers was
approximately 1: 5. Generally, women were allocated lighter jobs, like fetching water and stones,
and preparing meals for the same wage rate.

    2. Community Role in Project and Site Selection
The assessment confirmed that beneficiary communities were sensitized about the overall project
objective and to sub-project eligibility criteria. By and large beneficiary communities endorsed
the support for road works which constituted the main activity sponsored by the CfW
Programme. Road improvement was preferred over other activities because the financing
requirement (of high labor cost intensity to low material cost) was more consistent with the
eligibility criteria under the program.

   3. Appropriateness of the CfW Program and Wider Implication

Creating road networks to link communities with essential services, especially markets, was
endorsed as a priority by all stakeholders. Due to the high labor content under this component,
(the program could not finance any activity where material cost exceeded 40 percent of the
overall budget), community infrastructures with high material cost, such as construction of
schools and health facilities were not eligible to be financed under this component.

    4. Targeting
 The programme targeted 7 out of 13 districts in the country. Projects were approved for
communities by a Project’s Approval Committees, on which Local Council, NaCSA and other
stakeholders were represented. Direct beneficiaries were drawn from project localities, with
males accounting for about 75 percent of the workforce. Rotational work arrangement was used
to select beneficiaries. Contractors and local authorities swiftly altered the approach to
beneficiary targeting, from lottery to rotational methods, in direct response to the high interest on
the part of youths to participate in the program.

   5. Gender Sensitivity

The assessment found evidence that the women constituted a small percentage of the unskilled
workforce (close to 30 percent) given the high labor intensive nature of CfW interventions.

   6. Wage Rate
The analysis revealed wage differentials by district. The range was 4,000 to 7500 Leones. Direct
beneficiaries who worked in projects in Bo and Moyamba districts were offered the lowest wage,
while those in the Kono district received the highest wage. Beneficiaries from the Kono district
(Cemetery Road) provided information on the number of hours worked. Based on feedback –it
was noted that many beneficiaries worked for fewer number of days and for shorter durations.




                                                 44
Amputee beneficiaries reported that they were offered 6,000 Leones a day, worked for 10 days,
but only received pay for four days.

   7. Perceptions about Benefits from the CfW Project

Cash transfer to youths was designed to provide income to address critical needs such as food
and school fees. The proceeds earned from the CfW programs were used for the intended
purpose. Most beneficiaries reported that the income was used to feed their families, pay school
fees and purchase other items needed for schooling as well as cover medical costs. Student
beneficiaries used part of the income to pay college fees, while one female beneficiary
specifically implied that extra cash earned was contributed towards fees for ante natal care
services.

   8. Arrangements for Maintenance of CfW Projects

A maintenance committee was set up to oversee maintenance of the roads constructed under the
CfW component. At the time of the survey, beneficiaries confirmed plans were underway for the
rehabilitation of the road following the rainy season. Youth who were involved with the re-
habilitation of the Bo Baima road had access confirmed they had the tools in place and
organizational structure to clean and maintain the roads. Many relied on the internal self help
approach to keep the road in good condition. Beneficiaries of the Amputee tree planting project
in Port Loko district were committed to transplanting the nursery and monitoring the trees during
the rainy season. In the spirit of collective action and community integration, they were willing
to share seedlings from the nursery and provide land to all involved in transplanting seedlings.

    9. Benefits and Impacts of the CfW Program
Communities where CfW was implemented attributed specific benefits to the program. From the
experience of direct beneficiaries, the program created short term employment opportunities for
which they received income. Income was used on food purchase for the household, thereby
improving food security for these families. Female participants utilized part of the wages earned
to settle school and medical bills. Some women indicated they had saved some of their earnings
to set up a small business. One youth group in Kono, Community Partnership for Development
(CoPaD), also encouraged beneficiaries to pay part of the wages received into a fund, and
eventually they were able to save Le.3, 000,000. The group has been lending money to its
members and loan repayment has been good.

1.0 Introduction 
As part of the World Banks support to the post – conflict recovery efforts of the Government of 
Sierra  Leone,  the  Bank  funded  the  implementation  of  the  Emergency  Recovery  Support  Fund 
(ERSF)  project,  which  laid  the  fabric  for  the  post  conflict  recovery  of  the  country,  after  the 
successful  implementation  of  the  ERSF  and  considering  the  lessons  learned  and  the  gaps 
identified  in  the  implementation  of  the  ERSF,  in  2003,  a  financing  agreement  was  signed 
between the World Bank and the Government of Sierra Leone for the implementation of the 
National  Social  Action  Project  (NSAP).  The  Project  Development  Objective  of  the  NSAP  is  to 
assist war affected communities to restore infrastructure and services and build local capacity 
for  collective  action.  The  project  had  four  components  namely;  (i)  Community  Driven 
Programme, (ii) Rural Public Works Programme (iii) Shelter Programme for Vulnerable Groups 
and (iv) Project Management and Innovative Activities. The NSAP project was initially intended 
to  span  a  period  of  five  years,  at  the  end  of  the  fifth  year,  it  became  absolutely  essential  to 
extend  the  project  duration  for  an  additional  one  year  to  address  some  of  the  problems 
precipitated  by  global  food  price  increases.  Hence  another  component;  The  Cash  for  Works 
(CFW) was incorporated as part of the project. At the end of the project, it became evident that 
most of the performance targets set at the outset of the projects and those agreed upon during 
the  Mid  Term  Review,  were  largely  achieved;  the  project’s  performance  was  consistently 
satisfactory, both with regards to the development objective and to implementation progress. 
With an initial scheduled closing date of 12/31/2008. As of April 2008: (i) 600 community?based 
subprojects  had  been  generated  (project  target  is  600;  (ii)  1200  housing  units  had  been  built 
(project target is 1200); and (iii) nearly 161 km of feeder roads had been rehabilitated (target is 
200 km). Furthermore, more than 145,000 person?days of employment have been created on 
the rural roads component of the public works program alone (project target is 80,000 person?
days of temporary employment).    
  
In  compliance  with  the  reporting  obligations  of  borrowers  as  contained  in  the  agreement 
signed for the receipt of funds from the World Bank, each borrower is obliged to prepare and 
submit  to  the  Bank  at  the  end  of  the  project  implementation  period,  an  Implementation 
Completion  Report  (ICR).  The  ICR  is  an  integral  part  of  the  world  Banks’  drive  to  increase 
development  effectiveness,  through  the  provision  of  a  complete  systematic  account  of 
performance and results; Capture and disseminate experience from implementation of projects, 
accountability  and  transparency  in  the  implementation,  providing  a  vehicle  for  realistic  self?
evaluation of performance and a contribution to databases for aggregation. 
 
This NSAP Implementation Completion Report (ICR)  attempts to transmit a succinct assessment 
of the operation’s objective, design, implementation and operational experience including the 
economic,  financial,  procurement,  social  and  environment  safeguards,  institutional/  capacity 
building, IEC and M&E as well as the implementation and operational results.  
 
 
1.1    Background 
The National Commission for Social Action (NaCSA) was established by an Act of Parliament as a 
successor  institution  to  the  National  Commission  for  Reconstruction,  Resettlement  and 


                                                      52
Rehabilitation  (NCRRR).  The  NCRRR  was  conceived  as  an  emergency  response  government 
structure with the focal responsibility of providing leadership for the delivery of humanitarian 
services to communities and people affected by the war and at the same time acting on behalf 
of government as the main channel for restoring key services to communities after the war. 
 
The  transformation  from  an  emergency?oriented  to  a  medium  and  long?term  development 
institution  was  essentially  anchored  on  the  need  to  have  in  place  a  more  efficient  social 
protection mechanism. NaCSA is, therefore, a Social Fund with the core responsibility for taking 
the  resettlement  and  reintegration  processes  forward;  supporting  the  overall  reconstruction 
and  rehabilitation  of  social  services  and  community  infrastructure;  and  helping  communities 
rebuild their lives and livelihood systems.   
 
In  the  past,  NaCSA  essentially  relied  on  intermediaries  as  Implementing  Partners  to  deliver  a 
wide  range  of  support  services  to  communities.  These  intermediaries  include  local  and 
international  NGOs,  government  agencies  and  a  few  Community?Based  Organisations  (CBOs).  
Experience  gained  during  the  implementation  of  the  International  Development  Assistance 
(IDA)?funded  Emergency  Recovery  Support  Fund  (ERSF)  indicates  that  this  approach  has  not 
adequately enhanced community participation at all levels of the project cycle. The challenge 
for  NaCSA,  therefore,  was  the  adoption  of  an  approach  that  will  transfer  responsibility  for 
project implementation to communities while NaCSA and intermediaries play a facilitating role. 
The purpose of this approach is to strengthen community ownership of the projects and to help 
communities  take  responsibility  for  maintaining  and  sustaining  the  facilities  created  through 
such projects.  
 
The National Social Action Project (NSAP), which replaced the ERSF, provides support to NaCSA 
through: 1) the Community Driven Programme (CDP), using a Direct Community Financing (DCF) 
approach, 2) a pilot shelter initiative and 3) funds for the Public Works Programme (PWP) for 
feeder  roads  and  drainages  and  later  a  Cash  for  Works  segment  that  sought  to  obviate  the 
problems associated with the global increase in the food prices. This report provides insight in 
to the Implementation and completion of the NSAP project. .

received  a  credit  of  SDR  25.4  million  (US$  35  million)  from  the  International  Development 
Association to finance the National Social Action Project (NSAP) for 5 years (2003?2008).  The 
Project was designed to support two goals of the March 2002 Transitional Support Strategy for 
Sierra Leone (a) to reduce the risk of renewed conflict, and (b) to generate sustained poverty 
reduction. The Project Development Objective of NSAP is to assist war?affected communities to 
restore  infrastructure  and  services,  and  build  local  capacity  for  collective  action;  these 
objectives  were  achieved  through  participatory  processes  supported  by  the  National

Commission for Social Action (NaCSA) and include local initiatives to implement projects. These 
included  community  based  sub?projects  (rehabilitation  of  primary  schools,  health  posts, 
community water and sanitation, drainage etc.) rehabilitation of feeder roads and other rural 
infrastructure. Labour intensive techniques and a wide array of capacity building activities for 
communities,  districts  and  chiefdom  authorities.  Priority  was  given  to  areas  that  were  not 
previously  services  by  the  government,  newly  accessible  areas  and  safe  areas  (those  which 
were  under  rebel  control  until  January  2002),  and  the  most  vulnerable  population  groups 
within  those  areas.  The  project’s  objectives  and  expected  outcomes  were  clearly  stated  and 
consistent  with  existing  government  policies  especially  the  National  Recovery  Strategy  (NRS), 
the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) which is presently re?couched as the “Agenda for Change?. 
In addition, the NSAP was consistent with the World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 
theme  that  placed  premium  on  “strengthening  governance?  through  its  emphasis  on 
decentralization and community?based development.    
 
1.2.2    Revised Project Development Objective 
The original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) were slightly restructured during the Mid 
Term Review (MTR) of May 9th – 18th 2006. The change was to realign the PDO as stated in the 
Development  Credit  Agreement  (DCA)  to  be  consistent  with  that  of  the  Project  Appraisal 
Document  (PAD)  as  approved  by  the  Board,  as  followed  during  implementation,  and  as 
supervised by the World Bank. The bases for reformulation of the PDO were as follows:  
    1) The  PDO  in  the  PAD  reflects  the  rationale  of  the  operation  as  it  was  designed  and 
         described in all preparatory documents; and  
    2) The  PDO  in  the  PAD  reflects  the  interpretation  given  to  the  Project  during 
         implementation  by  both  the  Government  and  NaCSA  (National  Commission  for  Social 
         Action), the implementing agency for NSAP 
 
1.2.3     Original Components 
The project had three constituent components which are summarized below; 
 
Component 1. Community Driven Programme (CDP) (Estimated cost at appraisal US$ 28.Million) 
Under the Community Driven Programme component,   direct community financing approach 
(transferring all the funds required for the implementation of the project to the beneficiary communities) 
was  adopted  to  finance  demand?driven  community  based  social  and  economic  infrastructure 
sub  projects,  social  mobilization,  capacity  building  for  community  groups  and  sub  project 
monitoring  and  evaluation.  Special  emphasis  was  placed  on  reaching  under?served  areas 
including vulnerable communities in remote or newly accessible areas that were initially under 
rebel  custody.    The  categories  of  sub?projects  that  were  implemented  under  this  component 
included the following; rehabilitation and/construction and equipment for primary schools and 
health posts, community centres, latrines and public toilets, sewers and drainage, drying floors, 
IEC campaigns, functional literacy programmes, community?based conflict resolution activities, 
community  nutrition,  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  economic  infrastructure  such  as 
markets,  small?scale  water  supply  and  sanitation,  access  roads  and  bridges,  and  natural 
resource  management.  In  all  of  these  categories  of  sub  projects  that  were  implemented, 
communities contributed 10%. 


                                                   54
 
Component  2.  Pilot  Programmes  in  Newly  Accessible  Areas  (Estimated  cost  at  appraisal  US$  4 
Million) 
This component is divided into two (2) sub components these are; (a) Rural Labor Based Public 
Works, and (b) Shelter Programme for Vulnerable Groups. 
    (a) Rural Labor Based Public Works – This component supported the rehabilitation of basic 
          chiefdom and district infrastructure such as critical point rehabilitation of feeder roads 
          and  clean?up  of  drainage  systems.  This  component  mainly  provided  employment  to 
          unemployed youths, demobilized soldiers and other vulnerable groups. The works were 
          carried out using labour intensive methods. The amount utilized under each sub project 
          never exceeded US$ 50,000; all works were demand?driven with requests generated by 
          the  beneficiary  chiefdoms,  district  or  local  government  authority.  This  project  was 
          implemented  in  the  three  poorest  districts  (Koinadugu,  Kono  and  Kailahun)  of  the 
          country. 
    (b) Shelter  Programme  for  Vulnerable  Groups  –  In  terms  of  implementation  of  this 
          component, this shelter programme was sub?contracted to partners who provided basic 
          shelter  to  the  needy  or  vulnerable  households  especially  those  households  headed  by 
          females,  amputees  and  other  disabled  population  groups  as  a  means  of  supporting 
          resettlement  and  normalization  of  the  economy.  The  total  cost  of  the  largest  house 
          provided under this component never exceeded US$ 1,000 
 
Component 3. Project Management and Innovative Activities  (Estimated cost at appraisal US$10 
Million) 
This  component  basically  supported  the  Implementing  Agency’s  efforts  to  coordinate,  plan, 
monitor and supervise a wide range of community driven and poverty alleviation activities. This 
was done through the following channels; 
    (i) Capacity  Building  Activities,  for  beneficiary  communities,  chiefdoms,  Ministries  and 
          NaCSA  staff  in  the  areas  of  conflict  resolution  methodologies,  Environmental  Impact 
          Assessment, Financial Management and sub?. Participatory Poverty Assessments (PPA) 
          was  conduct  in  poorest  communities  as  a  medium  of  bringing  them  together  to  build 
          social capital. 
    (ii) IEC  Activities  –  All  the  sub  projects  implemented  had  IEC  segments  which  were 
          consistent with IEC approaches and materials pre?qualified or endorsed by the various 
          line ministries. 
    (iii) Monitoring  and  Evaluation  –  The  project  design  and  logical  framework  of  the  project 
          guided the monitoring and evaluation of the project throughput its life cycle. In addition, 
          Beneficiary  communities  identified  their  respective  quantitative  and  qualitative 
          indicators  that  they  considered  to  be  useful  in  making  comparisons;  these  community 
          identified  indicators  were  dovetailed  with  standardized  indicators  that  permit 
          comparisons with communities. 
    (iv) Short?term  specialized  technical  assistance  –  in  the  spheres  of  social  assessments, 
          beneficiary assessments, impact evaluations of sub projects, risk and vulnerability work, 
          financial  and  technical  audits,  refinement  of  participatory  assessment  methodologies, 
          micro finance, financial and technical audits and environmental studies.

1.2.4    Revised Components 
 The three components of the NSAP largely remained unchanged,  
 
The expiration of the initial NSAP project duration period – 2008, coincided with the global food 
price  increase  crises.  Upon  the  request  of  the  Government  of  Sierra  Leone,  the  World  Bank 
consented to provide an initial Grants from the FPCR (Food Price Crisis Response Multi?Donor 
Trust Fund) TF and (FPCR MDTF) to finance the continuation and expansion of a “Cash for Work? 
(CfW)  program  responding  to  food  price  increases.  The  project  was  designed  to  ease  the 
burden of the price increases on the most vulnerable populations and provide households with 
incremental  resources  to  cope,  helping  them  to  avoid  reverting  to  adverse  mechanisms  that 
would diminish their asset and human capital base.  
The CFW was regarded as a component under the NSAP project, this automatically increased 
the number of components under the NSAP to four. 
 
Component 4. Food Price Response – Cash for Work (Estimated cost at appraisal US$ 4 Million) 
This component is funded from Grants received by the Government of Sierra Leone from the 
FPCR  (Food  Price  Crisis  Response  Multi?Donor  Trust  Fund)  TF  and  (FPCR  MDTF)  the  Cash  for 
Work (CFW) Programme was created to aid the government of Sierra Leone in responding to 
food price increases. The project was designed to ease the burden of the price increases on the 
most  vulnerable  populations  and  provide  households  with  incremental  resources  to  cope, 
helping  them  to  avoid  reverting  to  adverse  mechanisms  that  would  diminish  their  asset  and 
human  capital  base.  The  CfW  program  was  designed  to  benefit  close  to  31,000  direct 
beneficiaries  (i.e.,  180,000  direct  and  indirect  beneficiaries)  including  unemployed  youth, 
female?headed  households,  and  vulnerable  rural  and  urban  households.  This  translates  into 
about 4 percent of the poorest in Sierra Leone concentrated in the areas most affected by the 
food price increases. In this context, this second additional grant or the Cash for Works Phase II 
employed about 16,515 beneficiaries over a 9?12 month period. This project was designed to 
ease  the  burden  of  the  price  increases  on  the  most  vulnerable  populations  and  provide 
households  with  incremental  resources  to  cope,  helping  them  to  avoid  reverting  to  adverse 
mechanisms that would diminish their asset and human capital base.  
 
The  program  drew  from  the  NaCSA  and  other  in?country  expertise,  while  also  utilizing  global 
best  practice  lessons  from  public  works  programs  in  India  and  across  Africa.  These  labor?
intensive  works  with  a  minimum  of  60  percent  labor  content  to  maximize  benefits  to 
participants. There were several levels of targeting for the selection of works sites: the districts 
were selected based on the food insecurity criteria established by WFP/FAO and the results of 
the 2007 Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Assessment (CFSVA), and intra?district 
targeting  of  sites  were  realized  in  collaboration  with  communities,  the  appropriate  Ministry, 
Department and Agency (MDA) (e.g., SLRA) and LCs based on a relative need and Vulnerability 
index.  Each  beneficiary  was  allowed  to  participate  in  the  program  once  for  duration  of  two 
months  (50  workdays).  Each  household  was  eligible  to  participate  with  only  one  member.  In 


                                                  56
case  of  number  o  f  applicants  exceeding  the  number  of  people  to  be  employed,  a  lottery 
system was utilized to select participants, subject to the stipulation that women should make 
up 30 percent of beneficiaries per project. In urban areas, the works included cleaning drains, 
garbage collection, street cleaning and other urban maintenance works, and in rural areas the 
works consisted of rehabilitation of small access roads, culverts and bridges and small irrigation 
schemes. A portion o f these works are expected to be temporary works designed to facilitate 
access to markets during the rainy season and enable distribution of food aid in remote areas. 
The  works  will  be  implemented  by  private  contractors,  specialized  NGOs  and  civil  society 
organizations, and will be supervised by LCs and NaCSA. The Table 1 depicts a summary of the

1.2.5   Original and Revised Indicators following the Mid Term Review of the NSAP 
At appraisal, the outputs indicators under each of the project component were clearly stated 
and  agreed  upon;  it  became  evident  at  the  Mid  Term  Review  of  the  NSAP  for  some  of  the 
original outputs to be reviewed to reflect the prevailing situation and reality on ground. Some 
of the major changes made to the indicators are outlined below; 
 
Changes in output indicator on Community?Driven Program (CDP) Component:  At appraisal, 
the  target  for  the  CDP  component  was  to  implement  at  least  1,000  community?based 
subprojects by end of the Project.  Based on the first year of experience, the initial proposed 
target for CDP subprojects was reviewed downwardly to 600 at project closure – equivalent to a 
reduction of 40% of the initial target. This reduction is justified by:  
        a)    An  increase  in  subprojects  costs  during  the  first  three  years  of  more  than  40%  in 
        Leones or national currency terms; and  
        b)  a  higher  than  expected  average  cost  per  subprojects  which  is  about  US$48,500, 
        compared  with  an  appraisal  estimate  of  US$28,000,  and  as  a  consequence  of  greater 


                                                     57
        than expected share of expensive projects in the overall portfolio, as prioritized by the 
        communities (primary schools, community health centers and posts against water and 
        sanitation projects, training centers, dry floors, and storages facilities).   
 
Changes  in  output  indicator  on  Pilot  Programs  in  Newly  Accessible  Areas  (Public  Works 
Program) Component: A key output indicator for the Public Works Program (subcomponent Bi) 
is the rehabilitation of approximately 100 km of feeder roads. As of MTR, the implementation 
and  financial  responsibility  of  this  subcomponent  had  been  transferred  to  the  three  District 
Councils of Kailahun, Kono, and Koinadugu under an MOU between them, NaCSA and the Sierra 
Leone Road Authority (SLRA).  District Councils indicated the need to rehabilitate access roads 
to particularly remote and isolated communities. Moreover, a new World Bank Infrastructure 
Development Project (Credit No. 2895?SL) financed the rehabilitation of 400 km of feeder roads 
primarily  in  the  same  districts,  and  coordination  between  the  new  Project  and  NSAP  brought 
NaCSA to focus on community access roads.   On average, rehabilitation of community access 
roads was less expensive than that of feeder roads (US$5,000 per km instead of US$10,000) and 
for this reason the Ministry of Finance proposed an increase to the initial target to 200 km by 
the end of the Project.   
 
Changes in target indicator on Pilot and Special Programs in Newly Accessible Areas (Shelter 
Program):  For  the  Shelter  Program  (subcomponent  Bii),  the  PAD  and  the  DCA  (Supplemental 
Letter No. 2) sets the target of building at least 1,700 housing units by the end of the second 
year  of  project  implementation.    During  project  supervision,  as  recorded  in  the  October  24, 
2004 Aide?Memoire and in subsequent discussions, management agreed – based on significant 
cost increases and on the increase in IDA disbursement percentages to 100% ? that the target 
be lowered to 1,200 units.  It should be noted that the decision to lower the target took place 
prior to MTR when it was concluded that this subcomponent would be postponed. 
3.8       Four indicators Removal of four indicators in Annex 1 of the PAD, including indicators 
3e.3, 3e.2, 3d.1, 2a.4: It is unclear how data on these indicators, in particular those related to 
management performance, were to be collected in a relatively small working environment and 
where organizational culture and management style were being developed.  The deletion the 
indicators under this component strengthened and streamlined the Project’s M&E framework, 
where there were already some 24 output indicators. Moreover, with regards to indicator 3e.3, 
(NaCSA  performance  in its  Public  Expenditures Tracking  Survey  –  PETS  –  score card  improved 
each semester) the monitoring of the PETS fell under the purview of the Ministry of Finance. 
However, the Ministry had little, if any, way to track expenditures made by NaCSA on NSAP. 
 
 
2. 0    Linkage between NSAP and the Cash for Works 
There is a link between the National Social Action Project and the Cash for Works project both 
of which were implemented by NaCSA with funds provided by the World Bank. At the end of 
the prescribe project duration for the implementation of the NSAP, there was an emergence of 
a global food price increases crises which devastatively affected post?conflict countries such as 
Sierra  Leone.    Global  food  prices  had  increased  26%  over  2004  –  2007,  and  food  crop  prices 
were expected to remain above 2004 levels through 2015.  The average export price for rice, 


                                                   58
for example, increased from US$375 per metric ton in January 2008 to US$775 per metric ton 
by June 2008. In Sierra Leone, rice being the main staple food in both urban and rural areas; in 
addition to the fact that the country produces only two thirds of Rice for national consumption 
(355,000 metric tons per year), with the shortfall sourced through imports and food aid. Sierra 
Leone is particularly vulnerable to rising food prices, and the FAO has listed Sierra Leone as one 
of the 8 most vulnerable food deficient low income countries globally in the current food prices 
crisis. Though the government of Sierra Leone had made frantic efforts to respond to the global 
scourge, the World Bank under its Global Food Crisis Response Programme agreed to support 
the Government of Sierra Leone with additional financing to respond to the food crisis. 
The rationale behind the additional financing was to capitalize on the solid performance of the 
IDA?funded  National  Social  Action  Project  (NSAP)  to  put  in  place  and  scale  up  safety  net 
interventions to help the poor cope with the drastic increases in food prices in Sierra Leone.  
 
In light of the perceptible achievements recorded by NaCSA in the implementation of the NSAP 
project,  and  the  strong  ties  established  with  communities  and  local  governments,  and  the 
partnerships with civil societies, the Cash for Works component of the NSAP provided a strong 
platform  from  which  the  safety  net  intervention  in  response  to  the  food  crises  was 
implemented. 
The  CFW  program  was  added  as  an  additional  project  component  under  the  existing  Credit 
Agreement (becoming ‘Part D’ of Schedule II) and its implementation arrangements remained 
essentially unchanged. The program consisted of small labor?intensive public works projects in 
rural, peri?urban, and urban areas. Participating workers received weekly payment, in cash, for 
their  labor.  The  program  built  on  the  project’s  experience  under  its  initial  rural  roads  public 
works  scheme  (i.e.  Part  B  (i)  of  the  Project  as  described  in  Schedule  2  to  the  Development 
Credit Agreement). As with that scheme, all works were demand?driven, with specific requests 
for  small  works  projects  originating  from  and/or  confirmed  with  relevant  communities, 
chiefdoms,  districts,  or  other  local  government  authorities.  However,  the  processes  that 
governed  “Cash  for  Work?  program  were  slightly  different  from  those  of  the  public  works 
component;  for  example,  the  wage  rate  was    lower  (to  capitalize  on  self?targeting),  it  was 
mandated  that  30%  of  employment  be  for  women,  and  communities/localities  will  express 
their interest to participate and nominate works projects through a simplified identification and 
consultation process. Furthermore, the menu of works that was implemented in a community 
was limited to ensure high labor ratios and maximum cash benefits to program participants. In 
rural  areas,  works  focused  on  road  and  small  bridge  rehabilitation,  in  which  case  the  Sierra 
Leone Roads Authority (SLRA) was brought in at the identification stage to ensure a coherent 
approach.    Works  also  included  small  irrigation  schemes,  tree  planting  and  others  that  were 
identified  by  farmers’  organizations  as  priority  needs.  In  urban  and  peri?urban  areas,  works 
included street cleaning, grass cutting, minor spot repairs on roads, cleaning open drains, and 
others, which would be identified in conjunction with urban councils. In essence, the cash for 
work was a component of the NSAP hence they were strongly dovetailed. 
 
 
3.0  Achievement of Project Development Objective (PDO) 
    Outcome / achievement of objective:

After  the  restructuring,  the  implementation  of  the  project  improved  substantially  and  the 
project achieved much in terms of the original Project Development Objective of assisting war 
affected  communities  to  restore  infrastructure,  services  and  build  local  capacity  for  collective 
action. With priority given to areas not previously serviced by the government, newly accessible 
areas  (those  which  were  under  rebel  control  until  January,  2002),  and  the  most  vulnerable 
population groups within those areas.  
NSAP has been successful to a large extent in fulfilling the key outcomes set out in the project 
document. Most important, NSAP interventions were evenly targeted at communities affected 
by  the  war  including  areas  that  were  captured  and  held  by  the  Revolutionary  United  Front 
(RUF) for a long period. The NSAP assets now provide services that were previously missing in 
those communities, and hence resulted to increase user access of those services. As indicated 
in the BIA report, the education sector for example has recorded substantial progress in Class I 
for example, enrolment across communities where school construction was undertaken. Data 
management is poor in most of the schools visited; however, the few available data revealed 
that in 2006 enrolment at Class I was 97 pupils, which climbed to 227 in 2007. Another wider 
impact  that  is  emerging  from  NSAP  is  that  communities  that  received  health  infrastructure 
support also reported improvement. The number of pregnant women who received antenatal 
care from NaCSA health facilities in 2006 was 150, the total for 2007  was 293, and increased 
significantly in 2008 to 938. The number of children treated for malaria cases in NaCSA health 
centres was 64 in 2006; in 2007, it came up to 730 children; and then increased further to 2,696 
children in 2008. The general trend shows progression in the number of users that have been 
accessing  these  facilities  once  they  became  available  to  communities,  see  Table  2  for  a 
breakdown of the number of beneficiaries accessing facilities provided under the project.

The  relevance  of  any  project  deliverable  is  essentially  determined  by  its  usefulness  to  the 
beneficiaries.  It  will  not  be  prudent  for  NaCSA  to  pursue  the  building  of  community 
infrastructure  and  other  assets  that  are  otherwise  out  of  step  with  priorities  of  the  target 
population  and  communities.  100%  of  the  NSAP  deliverables  appeared  to  mirror  beneficiary 
priorities in the vast majority of communities of intervention as reflected in the 2010 NSAP BIA 
report.  From the report it is clearly evident that the bulk (84%) of the interventions preferred 
by  communities  fall  within  the  categories  of  Education,  Health,  Sanitation  and      Community 
Infrastructure (See Table 3 below for details). There is clear evidence to show that  CDP created 
assets  have  been  consistent  with  the  original  NSAP    design    of    re?establishing    basic    social  
infrastructure    and    services    in    war    affected  communities    and    in    the    process    strengthen  
collective  action  and  contribute  to  social  capital formation  in  beneficiary  communities The 
BIA  report  further  noted  that  almost  every  Sub?Project  implemented  under  the  NSAP  were 
identified  by  members  of  the  communities  themselves  in  a  Participatory  Poverty  Assessment 
conducted in each target community. About 75% of the vulnerable Households targeted under 
the Cash for Work scheme reported positive benefits from the programme. 
 
Achievement of Outputs by Components 
 
Component 1. Community Driven Programme 
The principal output of the CDP component is the successful implementation and completion of 
demand driven community sub projects in communities affected by the civil war. The initial CDP 
target was to implement 1000 projects between 2003 and 2008. By 2006, however, this target 
was downwardly reviewed from 1000 Sub Projects to 600 mainly due to escalating project cost. 
The NSAP mid?term review report of 2006 for example quotes a significant jump in the price of 
cement,  from  Le  14,000  in  August  2003  to  Le  32,000  in  March  2006,  representing  128.5% 
inflation  in  the  price  of  cement  price  over  this  period.  It  is  clear  that  the  immediate  postwar 
context  under  which  NSAP  was  implemented  presented  varied  range  of  challenges  for 
managing  such  an  elaborate  programme.  NaCSA  was  successful  in  managing  the  project 
environment,  with  the  result  that  all  600  projects  were  implemented  across  the  country  as 
shown  on  the  Table  3  below.  Five  of  the  600  which  had  problems  mainly  linked  with  the 
performance of contractors have all been completed.

With  regards  to  the  conformity  of  sub?projects  implemented  under  this  component  with  the 
approved  standards,  designs  and  norms  of  the  relevant  Line  Ministries  95%  of  all  the  sub 
projects were in tandem with the prescribed standards etc. It is critical to note that, it was  a 
policy that new schools, health facilities for example, were to be only constructed away from 
existing  similar  facilities  within  specified  radius.  Hence  for  all  the  facilities  that  were 
constructed  in  the  various  communities,  the  receipt  of  a  letter  of  endorsement  from  the 
relevant Line Ministry clearly stating the approval of the relevant ministry for the construction 
to commence after having ensured that the said facility is consistent with the prescribed norms, 
design and standards. 
 
The  design  of  the  Community  Driven  Programme  component  reiterates  the  participation  of 
communities  in  the  identification  and  prioritization  of  their  needs,  for  any  sub?project  to  be 
approved  by  NaCSA,  the  community  must  have  conducted  a  comprehensive  Participatory 
Poverty Assessment (PPA) to ensure that the highly prioritized need translates into the support 
demanded by the said community. It cannot be over emphasized that PPAs were conducted in 
every community prior to the implementation of any sub project.  
 
Component 2. Pilot Programmes in newly accessible areas 
This component has two sub?components; (i) Rural based labour intensive public works and (ii) 
Shelter programme for vulnerable groups, the outputs highlighted under the Rural based labour  
intensive public works was not achieved due to changes effected to the component during the 
MTR.  A  key  output  indicator  for  the  Public  Works  Program  (subcomponent  Bi)  is  the 
rehabilitation  of  approximately  100  km  of  feeder  roads.  As  of  MTR,  the  implementation  and 
financial  responsibility  of  this  subcomponent  was  transferred  to  the  three  District Councils  of 
Kailahun,  Kono,  and  Koinadugu  under  an  MOU  between  them,  NaCSA  and  the  Sierra  Leone 
Roads  Authority  (SLRA).    District  Councils  indicated  the  need  to  rehabilitate  access  roads  to 
particularly  remote  and  isolated  communities.  Moreover,  a  new  World  Bank  Infrastructure 
Development Project (Credit No. 2895?SL) financed the rehabilitation of 400 km of feeder roads 
primarily  in  the  same  districts,  and  coordination  between  the  new  Project  and  NSAP  brought 
NaCSA to focus on community access roads.   On average, rehabilitation of community access 


                                                    62
roads is less expensive than that of feeder roads (US$5,000 per km instead of US$10,000) and 
for this reason the Ministry of Finance proposed an increase to the initial target to 200 km by 
the end of the Project.  Invariably with the transfer of the Labour intensive Public Works to the 
councils,  the  outputs  ((i)  200Km  of  Access  roads  rehabilitated,  (ii)  90,000  person  days  of 
temporary employment created, (iii) 30,000 women days of temporary employment created, (iv) 
90%  of  completed  sub  projects  are  of  satisfactorily  technical  quality  or  better)  for  this  sub 
component were to be reflected in the reports of the respective councils. 
 
The second Sub?Component dealt with shelter construction, the construction of shelters under 
this sub component was sub?contracted to other NGOs. The initial target of 1,700 shelter units 
which  were  to  be  constructed  during  the  project  duration  was  reviewed  downwardly  from 
1,700  housing  units  to  1,200  housing  units.  This  revision  was  in  response  to  an  increase  in 
construction costs. While this subcomponent was delayed at MTR because of poor performance, 
management  agreed  to  support  the  completion  of  the  Program  and  that  the  target  of  1,200 
shelters  would  be  retained.  As  of  September  2007,  908  shelters  had  been  built  under  the 
Shelter Program so the scheme was suspended. In terms of the output of ensuring that 1,200 
housing  units  are  constructed  in  two  years,  it  is  evident  that  only  75%  of  the  houses  were 
constructed.  There  after  the  shelter  programme  was  suspended.  Out  the  75%  housing  units 
that  were  constructed  90%  of  the  completed  shelters  were  resistant  to  rains.  100%  of  the 
constructed houses were for the use of marginalized population (Female headed households, 
disabled and their families) 
 
 
Component 3: Project Management and Innovative Activities 
Under this component, the implementation of the project ensured that both the capacities of 
the communities, chiefdoms, district authorities were built especially in the area of identifying 
and  implementing  projects.  As  reflected  in  the  BIA  report,  there  was  a  preponderance  of 
project  beneficiaries  who  confirmed  that  target  communities  were  trained  in  the  conduct  of 
Participatory  Poverty  Assessment  which  formed  the  basis  for  the  identification  and 
prioritization  of  the  various  community  needs  (see  Table  4  ?  a  typical  example  of  the  way  in 
which  decisions  were  arrived  at  in  the  selection  of  sub  projects).  Beneficiary  communities, 
chiefdom and district authorities were all for training in the tenets of the implementation of the 
project.  The  services  of  Non  Governmental  Organizations  (NGOs)  were  engaged  to  conduct 
community mobilization and facilitation with respect to the implementation of the NSAP. For 
the  Community  Driven  Programme  under  NSAP,  for  each  Sub  Project,  a  Project  Management 
Committee (PMC) was constituted and training in handling the overall implementation of the 
Project. From the two BIAs conducted, the majority (80%) of respondents selected beneficiary 
communities  confirmed  that  the  capacity  building  packages  provided  under  NSAP  were  in  no 
small measure successful.

With  respect  to  Information,  Education  and  Communication  (IEC)  on  the  NSAP  Information 
Education  and  Communication  (IEC)  campaigns  were  undertaken  by  the  Information, 
Communication  and  Technology  (ICT)  division  of  NaCSA  throughout  the  sub?project  cycle.  IEC 
activities are primarily designed to encourage a two?way flow of information with the view of 
involving  key  stakeholders  in  the  development  process,  by  providing  information  to  them, 
listening  to  their  feedback,  and  responding  appropriately.   On  the  one  hand,  NaCSA  provides 
information  to  stakeholders  through  radio  programmes,  information  leaflets/brochures  and 
newspaper  articles,  while  on  the  other  hand,  local  stakeholders  make  their  views  known  and 
provide feedback through face?to?face community meetings and phone?in radio  programmes. 
To increase the effectiveness and impact of communication activities, specific communication 
materials  were  are  provided  for  specific  stakeholders/target  groups,  and  delivered  through 
appropriate  channels,  in  a  systematic  and  sustained  way.  Public  Information  leaflets, 
summarizing content and implementation strategy of the programme are distributed to literate 
stakeholders,  while  phone?in  radio  programmes  in  local  languages  are  organized  to  provide 
information  to  literate  and  non?literate  members  of  the  public  and  encourage  their  feedback 
and  participation.  From  findings  of  the  independent  BIA  conducted,  project  beneficiaries 
indicated that most (90%) of them came to learn about the implementation of the NSAP project 
through the following, Community sensitization meetings facilitated by NaCSA field staff, Radio

announcements and Jingles, announcements in religious gatherings such as church or Mosques. 
From the results of the BIA study, it became clear that the communities were fully sensitized 
about  each  sub  project  prior  to  its  implementation.  Notwithstanding  the  achievements 
highlighted, our efforts to conduct IEC activities in all the target communities were affected by 
the following challenges; 
 
     Differences  in  socio?economic  characteristics  of  the  multiple  target  groups  required 
        multi?media  channels  (radio,  TV,  newspapers,  leaflets,  meetings,  etc)  for  effective 
        communication, monitoring and evaluation. This, however, had cost implications, and in 
        the  face  of  rising  costs  for  utilization  of  various  media  channels,  working  within  the 
        allotted budget for effective communication was very challenging. 
       Limited access to media and communication outlets, particularly in rural areas made it 
        difficult  to  reach  out  to  some  stakeholders.  This  often  left  NaCSA  and  implementing 
        partners with the option of increasing the number of direct community meetings. 
       Deep rooted cultural practices also made it difficult in some communities to engage and 
        get feedback from particular stakeholders, such as women. 
     
In terms of awareness of chiefdoms, district and government on the NSAP coverage, targeting 
methodology, the sensitization meeting and launching of the projects in the respective Regional, 
District  and  chiefdom  Headquarter  towns  were  provided  with  adequate  information  on  the 
coverage, targeting methodology used under the NSAP.

Component 4: Food Price Response – Cash for Works 
The cash for Works programme which was in response to government’s efforts to cushion the 
effects  of  the  global  food  price  increase  was  implemented  as  an  additional  financing  to  the 
existing NSAP. The first phase of the cash for works (CFW) which started in 2008 ended in 2009, 
the second phase started in 2009 and ended in 2010. As a strategy for the implementation of 
both phases NaCSA engaged the services of local contractors (Registered small?contractors, Youth 
Groups/CBOs and  Artisans)  to  implement  the  CFW  sub  projects  in  Urban,  Peri?urban  and Rural 
communities,  the  first  phase  of  the  project  targeted  seven  priority  districts  (Koinadugu,  Kono, 
Kailahun etc..) with the scale?up in the second phase all fourteen districts, the menu  of works that 
was implemented in a community was limited to ensure high labor ratios and maximum cash 
benefits  to  program  participants,  the  types  of  works  undertaken  included  the  following;    In 
rural  areas,  works  focused  on  road  and  small  bridge  rehabilitation,  in  which  case  the  Sierra 
Leone Roads Authority (SLRA) was brought in at the identification stage to ensure a coherent 
approach.    Works  also  included  small  irrigation  schemes,  tree  planting,  land  reclamation  and 
others that were identified by farmers’ organizations as priority needs. In urban and peri?urban 
areas, works included street cleaning, grass cutting, minor spot repairs on roads, cleaning open 
drains, and others, which were identified in conjunction with Local councils. In both phases a 
total number of 727 sub projects were generated and implemented (Table 6), the generation 
and implementation of sub?projects in each of the phases was done in three successive waves 
to ensure effective monitoring and supervision.

In terms of  the number of temporary employments created by the project, at the end of the 
implementation  of  the  second  phase  of  the  implementation  a  cumulative  figure  of  1,666,160  
person  days  of  temporary  employment  were  created,  this  translates  into  a  total  number  of 
31,770 people that were temporarily employed under this project. 
 
In  adherence  to  the  requirement  for  30%  of  the  employees  engaged  under  this  project  be 
women,  our  records  indicate  that  449,848  woman?days  of  temporary  employment  were 
created in labor?intensive public works.

With  regards  to  the  awareness  of  household  in  the  target  areas  about  the  programme,  the 
existing IEC architecture within the Commission was fully utilized to ensure that all the target 
communities were adequately informed or provided with the basic information relating to the 
Cash  for  Work  programme  such  as  details  on  eligibility,  targeting,  implementation,  community 
involvement. The results of the BIA that was conducted indicates that over 75% of households in 
targeted  communities  had  adequate  knowledge  about  the  implementation  and  the 
opportunities that exists under the Cash for Works Programme, thus there is an ever increasing. 
 
In  spite  of  the  remarkable  achievements  recorded  under  the  Cash  for  Work  Programme  the 
programme  had  some  challenges  these  includes;  difficulty  of  putting  the  relevant  documents 
together especially relating to the third party – the contractors; the participation of females in 
the  cash  for  work  in  most  areas  was  always  below  optimal,  in  addition,  seasonality  greatly 
affected the completion of some of the roads projects. 
 
4. 0  Key factors and Events affecting Implementation and Outcome  
The  implementation  of  the  NSAP/CfW  was  faced  with  factors  both  within  and  outside  the 
control of the implementing agency (NaCSA) and the Government of Sierra Leone. Among these 
factors are:  
        o   Factors outside the control of Government or the implementing Agency – NaCSA 
Inflation/global  increases  in  prices  increased  the  cost  of  project  implementation  beyond  the 
project  costs  at  appraisal,  resulting  in  reduction  of  number  of  sub?projects  implemented  and 
delay in the time of project completion.  
 
Weather/seasonality which was also beyond the control of NaCSA affected the completion of 
some projects and in some cases negatively affected the status of completion, for e.g., during 
the heavy rains roads already done were washed and damaged. Redoing such roads was hardly 
possible  as  it  was  not  budgeted  for.    The  success  of  Agricultural  sub?projects  was  also 
dependent on favourable weather conditions.  
 
Expectations  of  communities  across  the  country  for  post?war  development  were  higher  than 
what the project provided. NaCSA was therefore left with the responsibility of managing these 
expectations as and when necessary. 
  
 
        o   Factors generally subject to Government control 
Policies  and  Regulations  that  ensure  transparency  and  accountability  in  the  project 
implementation  was  the  responsibility  of  government.  For  example  the  National 
Regulations/Acts relating to transparent procurement procedures ensures transparency in the 
expenditure of project funds. 
 
The  structure  and  role  of  the  government  local  councils  in  governance  and  service  to 
communities  was  very  useful  in  ensuring  the  participation  of  communities  in  the  project 
implementation and sustainability even after completion of the project. The contribution of the 
local councils financially in maintenance of the projects after handing over to the communities 


                                                  68
increased  the  sense  of  community  ownership,  and  strengthened  relations  between  local 
government and communities. 
 
        o    Factors generally subject to implementing agency control 
Project appraisal and environmental impact assessment were key to the success of the project 
implementation.  NaCSA  had  the  responsibility  of  ensuring  that  environmental  issues,  where 
applicable,  were  identified  and  made  known  to  the  beneficiaries  and  communities  trained  in 
monitoring environmental safeguards. However, in an impact survey conducted during the life 
cycle  of  the  project,  it  was  realized  that  not  all  communities,  contractors  and  local  councils 
were  adequately  trained  to  monitor  environment  and  social  safeguards  of  the  projects.  Also, 
trainings  conducted  in  2009  did  not  cover  the  contractors  and  the  majority  of  the  councilors 
who together with the community members were the primary implementers of the subprojects. 
 
Capacity  building  for  both  NaCSA  staff  and  beneficiary  communities  and  keeping  the 
communities  informed  of  developments  or  changes  in  plans  or  financing  was  important  to 
mutual  understanding  between  the  beneficiaries  and  the  executing  agency.  Capacity  building 
training was provided for beneficiary communities and Local/District Councils in various areas 
including  Participatory  Poverty  Assessment;  Community  Environmental  Impact  Assessment; 
Conflict  Transformation;  Community  Animation  and  Mobilization;  Sub?project  Cycle;  Financial 
Management; and HIV/AIDS and Malaria 
 
 
NaCSA had the responsibility of ensuring that communities claim ownership to the sub?projects 
implemented  in  their  communities.  This  was  ensured  through  the  Community  Management 
Committees, participation of women and vulnerable groups and contribution of 10 percent of 
the  project  cost  in  the  form  of  local  materials.  To  make  provision  for  the  participation  of 
women, 30% of the Project Management Committee for each sub?project comprised of women. 
Even  though  problems  were  encountered  in  some  communities  in  the  provision  of  local 
materials the majority complied. 
 
Control over the quality and pace of the project execution: regular monitoring and supervision 
of  the  project  implementation  process,  including  technical  supervision.  NaCSA  also  had  to 
manage  demands  from  politicians  to  influence  the  allocation  of  subprojects  in  an  inefficient 
manner.  
 
Technical  monitoring  of  civil  works  sub?projects  was  required  to  ensure  quality  work.    The 
Regional civil works officers had the responsibility for technical monitoring, which was done on 
a  monthly  basis  or  at  critical  stages  of  the  construction.    They  ensured  that  the  designed 
specifications for the project were being followed.  They reported findings on the quality and 
pace of work to the DC and RC, as  well as the CDP Director and the regional M&E officers in 
writing.  All  monitoring  reports  were  copied  to  the  PMC  and  the  contractor  and  then  entered 
into the project file.  All subsequent disbursements were based on a Valuation Certificate prepared by 
the  Civil  Engineer  and  counter?signed  by  the  CDO  certifying  the  level  of  accomplishment  of  the  work.  




                                                        69
The certificate was then attached to the community project progress report and disbursement request 
to justify payment of next tranche.  
 
 
       o   Costs, financing and procurement 
The funding for the project implementation was primarily from the Bank and therefore cost of 
the project largely depended on how much funding was provided by the Bank. Careful targeting 
had  to  be  done  to  select  the  most  vulnerable  groups  for  funding  and  sub?project  allocation. 
While  the  government  of  Sierra  Leone  (GoSL)  committed  to  paying  10  percent  of  the  total 
project cost, beneficiary communities were to contribute to 10 percent of the total cost of sub?
project  implemented.  There  were,  however,  delays  on  the  part  of  GoSL  and  beneficiary 
communities in meeting their own part of the agreement which resulted in delay in completion 
of subprojects. 
 
Due  to  inflation,  the  costs  of  project  implementation  increased  above  the  initial  target  cost, 
resulting  in  reduced  number  of  projects  implemented.  In  addition  the  delay  in  the  release  of 
funds either at the start of the subproject or during implementation did not only increase costs 
because  of  price  escalation,  but  also  decreased  the  momentum  of  the  communities  to 
participate  in  subproject  works  as  they  opted  to  undertake  other  activities  depending  on 
seasonal calendar. 
 
At  the  inception  of  the  NSAP,  NaCSA  had  very  little  procurement  capacity,                           
with  no  procurement  unit.  For  efficiency  in  costs  and  financing  and  necessary  checks  against 
corruption  procurement  procedures  previously  used  were  reviewed  by  the  Bank  to  avoid  the 
following: i) Extensive use of sole source method for selection of consultants and procurement 
of works and goods; ii) extensive and repetitive use of procedures, often including same firms, 
iii) unclear procedures for opening of bids and criteria for bid evaluation and contract award; iv) 
post contract negotiations; v)  mandatory use of state insurance company for goods contracts, 
and  vi)  over?centralization  of  procurement  processing  in  the  Central  Tender  Board.  A 
procurement unit was later put in place which was charged with the responsibility of  preparing 
annual procurement plans as part of the annual work plans/budget; procurement planning and 
processing;  supervising  performance  of  contracts  with  suppliers;  ensuring  adequate  stores 
management; assessing procurement capacity of communities prior to signature of subproject 
agreement  and  making  recommendations  for  any  required  improvements;  providing 
procurement assistance to and capacity building/training of communities and supervising and 
ensuring  compliance  with  procurement  procedures  by  communities  and  NGOs.    Procurement 
procedures and award of contracts under the NSAP was in accordance with the procurement 
arrangements and thresholds in the appraisal document, the rules of the World Bank and the 
National Public Procurement Authority of Sierra Leone (See Table 7). The procurement of goods, 
services  and  works  for  the  execution  of  the  project  was  conducted  at  NaCSA  Head  quarters 
through National, International competitive bidding and shopping. Supervision, monitoring and 
management of works contracts were carried out by independent consultants and NaCSA staff 
at  the  districts,  regions  and  Headquarter.  For  CfW,  selection  of  service  providers  was  carried 
out  through  local  shopping  at  district  and  community  levels.  Payment  of  contractors  was

     contracts were done by NaCSA staff at district region and headquarters levels.

     One of the principal reasons for the continued existence of the National Commission for Social 
     Action (NaCSA) is to expedite and ensure effective implementation of projects. NaCSA does not 
     formulate  new  policies  but  rather  monitors  them  to  ensure  that  all  projects  implemented  by 
     the Commission advance national policy goals and promote coherence among sectoral policies 
     at all levels. 
      
     There  is  a  strong  nexus  between  the  Project  Development  Objective  and  the  development 
     priorities and circumstances prevailing. The matrix below transmits this linkage;

      Strategy                                PRSP)  and  the  PRSP?II  have  the  same 
                                              fundamental priorities; governance, re?launching 
                                              the  economy,  supporting  education,  health, 
                                              agriculture, health and promoting gender equity, 
                                              these  priorities  were  reflected  in  the  sectoral 
                                              criteria  established  for  funding  projects  under 
                                              the NSAP. 
                                             Under the province of governance; NSAP using its 
                                              Community  Driven  Process  empowered  local 
                                              community,  chiefdom  and  district  governance 
                                              structures  to  participate  actively  in  the 
                                              development          process       and       promoted 
                                              decentralization. 
                                             Substantial  amounts  of  monies  were  disbursed 
                                              under the NSAP Project and this had an effect on 
                                              the macro?economy and the private sector. 
                                             The delivery of support through the Public Works 
                                              Programme  for  capacity  building  among  local 
                                              contractors,  the  purchase  and  use  of  local 



                                              72
                                          materials  where  possible  and  the  inclusion  of 
                                          Civil  Society  in  the  Board  of  Directors  are 
                                          examples  of  ways  through  which  the  Project 
                                          involved and promoted the private sector during 
                                          implementation. 
3.    Crowding In and Out                There  was  little  or  no  evidence  of  crowding  out 
                                          investments  that  would  otherwise  have  been 
                                          made  by  sector  ministries  or  other  donors.  The 
                                          NSAP  budget  was  small  when  compared  with 
                                          other  investments.  It  was  therefore  only  a 
                                          complement  instead  of  substitute  for  other 
                                          activities.  In  education,  health  and  transport 
                                          sectors,  the  IDA  financed  sectoral  interventions,  
                                          other donors, notably EU, DFID and the AfDB also 
                                          had substantial investments in these sectors. 
                                         The  project  crowded  in  additional  resources  for 
                                          poverty  alleviation,  because  of  the  delivery 
                                          mechanism  and  the  strong  field  presence 
                                          sustained  by  the  NSAP  support.  The  Strategy  of 
                                          participation  of  communities  leveraged 
                                          community resources directly, this was estimated 
                                          at 10% of the total project cost. 
4.    Economic Recovery                  The  investments  in  rural  areas  created  jobs  and 
                                          provided  income  as  part  of  the  economic 
                                          recovery.  The  Public  Works  Component  created 
                                          approximately  800,000  people’s  days  of 
                                          temporary  employment  to  demobilized 
                                          combatants  and  unemployed  youths  of  which 
                                          one?third benefitted women. 
5.    The Case for Public Funding        The  Private  sector  particularly  the  social  sectors 
                                          are  limited  and  mostly  restricted  to  Freetown 
                                          and  few  other  urban  towns.  Almost  all  schools 
                                          and  health  care  units  are  government  assisted. 
                                          The  bulk  of  the  population  actually  relied  on 
                                          these  public  institutions  for  health  care  and 
                                          educational services. Given the project’s focus on 
                                          investments  in  remote  and  newly  accessible 
                                          areas,  there  was  little  or  no  displacement  of 
                                          private service providers, as they were few. 
 
 
6.0 Overarching Themes, other Outcomes and Impacts 
 



                                          73
Poverty reduction impact: NSAP/CfW was primarily to address the following in post?war Sierra 
Leone: Post?conflict reconstruction, Access to food, shelter for refugees and IDPs, employment 
opportunities for youths in particular, social services, access to safe drinking water, improved 
health and sanitation. Since poverty reduction is a rather complex dynamics (in terms of ‘cause?
effect’),  the  relationship  between  project  outcomes  and  reduction  in  poverty  status  of 
beneficiaries  is  not  direct.  Therefore,  proxy  indicators  such  as  number  of  pupil  enrolled  in 
school facilities; number of people accessing health facilities; or access to feeder roads etc. are 
used to show the impact of the project on poverty reduction.  

For example, the 2010 NSAP beneficiary impact assessment report shows that in the education 
sector, following the refurbishment of 24 schools in 2006 in the East, South and North Regions, 
the overall enrolment increased from 7921 to 9950 pupils (25.62%) and in 2007 with 55 schools 
refurbished, the overall enrolment increased from 15,096 to 19,202 pupils (21.39%).  

In terms of access to health facilities, the BIA report shows that with the NSAP intervention, the 
use of public transport to access health facilities dropped from 33% to 2% as a result of close 
proximity of health facilities. The staff strength at health facilities increased from 48 to 92 (88% 
increase). With respect to Job creation under the CfW sub?component, 800,000 person days of 
temporary employment and 250,000 “woman days? was provided with 16,515 beneficiaries. 

The  Community  infrastructures  (community  centres,  health  centres,  markets)  improved  the 
general  livelihood  of  the  target  populations  in  diverse  ways.  Community  centres  enhanced 
better  social  interactions;  health  centres  and  water  and  sanitation  reduced  prevalence  of 
diseases,  maternal  and  child  deaths;  and  the  markets  improved  entrepreneurship  and 
household income among women. The formation of PMC’s at the community level undoubtedly 
gave members the implementation capacity and at the same time inadvertently facilitated the 
identification of potential leaders among the community members. Another benefit is that of 
social cohesion as members of the communities join hands in solving their common problems 
such  as  constructing  of  schools,  community  centres  etc.  Community  members  had  the 
opportunity of developing a sense of responsibility to their communities, particularly regarding 
the use of community resources, gender relations, well?being of the marginalised or vulnerable 
individuals or households and conflict resolution.  
 
CDD  approach  was  partly  used  as  an  instrument  for  target  beneficiaries  to  express  their  felt 
needs  hoping  that  NaCSA  would  help  solving  them.  On  the  contrary  numerous  applications 
were raised and not all were approved leading to frustrations on the part of the communities 
left out especially as they were just emerging from war. 
  
Through the CDD approach target communities have increased their capacity to analyse their 
poverty  situation  and  plan  how  to  solve  some  of  their  socio?economic  constraints.  The 
provision  of  community  infrastructures  to  war  affected  communities  as  highlighted  above 
brought substantial benefits to the target communities in terms of improved social capital and 
increased access to and use of social and economic infrastructure and services.  
 


                                                   74
Even  though  temporary,  the  CfW  provided  much  needed  income  which  some  beneficiaries 
reinvested  for  sustained  income  earning.  Women  especially  had  the  opportunity  of  being 
employed and earning monies on their own.  
 
The construction and rehabilitation of feeder roads increased agricultural trade as vehicles had 
access  to  farm  gates;  motorbikes  which  are  common  means  of  transport  in  Sierra  Leone  can 
now easily make way to communities that were cut off from urban areas. 
 
7.0 NaCSA Exit Strategy  
 

7.1 Sustainability arrangements for NaCSA as an institution 

NaCSA  has  contributed  immensely  to  poverty  reduction  and  local  governance  much  to  the 
satisfaction  of  successive  governments.  In  this  regard,  NaCSA  continues  to  be  relevant  in  the 
development paradigm of the country. Therefore, the government has extended the life?span 
of  NaCSA  from  2008  –  2018  and  expanded  its  mandate  to  cover  other  areas  of  intervention 
such  as  ‘Social  Protection’  and  ‘Reparations’  that  that  are  an  integral  part  of  government’s 
social  development  policy.  As  such  NaCSA’s  continued  existence  is  dependent  on  its 
performance and continued relevance in social development. 

In terms of the NSAP, NaCSA has the responsibility to ensure that all arrangements in terms of 
handing over facilities to the beneficiaries, all outstanding sub?projects are completed and all 
documentations to the bank (project completion report, Financial audits etc.) are done.  Even 
though  NaCSA  largely  depends  on  donor  funds,  it  is  a  semi?autonomous  government  agency 
that  has  transformed  from  an  emergency  post?conflict  program  to  a  community  driven 
program.  NaCSA  has  transformed  from  the  Ministry  of  Reconstruction,  Resettlement  and 
Rehabilitation  in  1996  to  the  National  Commission  for  Reconstruction,  Resettlement  and 
Rehabilitation in 1998 and as NaCSA in 2001 with a mandate to provide service to Sierra Leone 
till  2018.  NaCSA  collaborates  with  relevant  Ministries,  private  sector  partners  and  other 
interested donor partners in the execution of its mandate. Since the facilities provided under 
the  NSAP/CfW  are  not  enough  to  address  all  the  problems  of  the  needs  of  the  poor  rural 
communities, NaCSA will continue to source funds by either scaling up or for new interventions 
that will address the needs of the poor in Sierra Leone. 

7.2 Sustainability of sub?projects   

There  was  a  general  understanding  of  NaCSA’s  exit  plan  by  the  beneficiary  communities.  On 
completion of every sub?project an official commissioning and handing over takes place, with 
the responsibility of sustaining the facility officially handed over from the Project Management 
Committee to the Project Maintenance Committee with the support of the Local Council. The 
concept of community led and ownership was reflected in the arrangements made by NaCSA 
and its partners regarding maintenance of the facilities. For some communities, management & 
maintenance of facilities like water wells and toilets are undertaken either through committees 


                                                   75
formed  by  themselves  or  volunteers.  In  the  case  of  roads  maintenance  arrangements,  in 
addition to youths, Local Council and the Sierra Leone Roads Authority are involved as a result 
of the level of technical demand and resources involved in the maintenance of the roads.   At 
National level, relevant MDAs take over to ensure the facility became functional. For a health 
facility for example, the Ministry of Health is expected to provide the required personnel and 
equipment; for educational institutions, the Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports is to ensure 
teachers,  teaching  and  learning  materials  are  available.  A  crucial  issue  in  sustainability  and 
maintenance  of  the  facilities  is  finance.  Some  of  the  facilities  like  markets  and  community 
centres generate income for maintenance, while some others do not. This aspect is, however, 
either left with the community and Local Councils to decide; otherwise NaCSA a maintenance 
fund is kept from the project fund which is utilised as and when the need arise for maintenance.
