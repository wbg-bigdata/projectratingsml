REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO BANCO DE LA VIVIENDA DEL PERU
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF PERU FOR AN
URBAN SITES AND SERVICES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Banco de la Vivienda del Peru with the guarantee of the Republic
of Peru for the equivalent of US$21.6 million to help finance an Urban
Sites and Services Development project. The loan would have a term of 20
years, including three years of grace, with Interest at 8.85 percent per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Economic Position and Prospects of Peru"
(No. 655-PE) was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 3, 1975.
Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        Since 1968 the Government has followed a development strategy in
which economic growth is linked to a transformation of the society to achieve
broader popular participation in the country's economic, social and politi-
cal life, thus addressing one of the most serious problems of Peru's economy
and society -- the sharp differences in wealth and opportunities between
income classes and geographical regions. As was recognized by the Consulta-
tive Group for Peru, which met in Paris in April 1975, progress has been
made during recent years in implementing this strategy. The land reform in
the coastal areas is advanced and, although greater difficulty has been found
in Improving the lot of the Sierra peasants, efforts to organize production
cooperatives there are being accelerated. In the field of industry most
enterprises have complied with the Industrial Community legislation -- which
provides for a gradual participation of the workers in the ownership of
enterprises -- and a new Social Property Law was approved aimed at promoting
new industrial and entrepreneurial capacity within a system of self-manage-
ment by the employees.
4.        A new government headed by General Morales Bermudez took office in
August 1975. It has been reassessing the progress made since 1968 and has
publicly acknowledged that errors had been committed during the past eight
years in the difficult task of reconciling growth, financial stability and
better income distribution. The main problems that arose were a contraction
in domestic savings, a fall in efficiency in the productive sectors and a
retrenchment in the level of investment by the private sector. The President
has stated the need for important modifications in policies that would leave
the basic long term objectives unchanged, but would call for a more gradual
approach to reforms of the economic and social system, and would emphasize
measures that increase domestic savings, encourage private sector investment
and improve efficiency in production.

5.        GDP grew at an annual rate above 5.5 percent during 1970-74.    Gross
domestlc investment rose from less than 13 percent to almost 17 percent of
GDP between 1970 and 1974, largely because of the increase of public and
private investment in mining and petroleum. However, as consumption also
grew faster than GDP and heavy losses were incurred by public enterprises
marketing imported petroleum and foodstuffs, gross national savings fell
from 15 to 11 percent of GNP between 1970 and 1974. The excessive growth of
aggregate demand combined with the sharp rise In Peru's import prices since
1973 resulted In an acceleration of the annual rate of domestic inflation --
from an average annual rate of 7.2 percent during 1969-73 to over 18 percent
In 1974 -- and an increase in the deficit of the balance of payments on
current account from 0.5 to 6.2 percent of GDP between 1972 and 1974. Net
long-term capital inflows rose from $110 million in 1972 to $840 million in
1974 and allowed a $275 million increase in net international reserves in
spite of the widened resource gap.
6.        During 1975 the Government approved a series of tax and price
measures directed at attacking some of the causes of Peru's financial diffi-
culties, i.e., excessive growth of aggregate demand with a resulting fall in
national savlngs, stagnation of food output and low rate of export growth.
In January 1975 indirect taxes were increased and subsidies on food were
reduced. On June 1975 a second set of measures included: (a) increases in
prices of basic foodstuffs, petroleum (ranging from 25 percent for diesel
fuel to 100 percent for premium gasoline), and other basic goods such as
steel and cement; (b) a 40 percent reduction in prices of fertilizers;
(c) strict controls on salary adjustments in the public and private sec-
tors. Subsequently, in September the Sol was devalued by about 14 percent.
7.        The measures taken did not suffice to stop a sharp deterioration
of Peru's external and internal finances largely because of two factors. In
the first place, export earnings fell because of the decline in world prices
of Peru's exports, adverse weather conditions and labor strikes. The decline
in export demand, together with work stoppages, resulted in a drop in mining
output; ecological conditions limited the recovery of fishmeal production
and reduced the catch of food fish; while bad weather conditions, inadequate
supply and high prices of fertilizers and other production inputs, and in-
adequate price and marketing policies followed in previous years, affected
agricultural output. Secondly, while gross domestic investment rose to
19 percent of GDP, savings continued to drop and the resource gap widened
to over 9 percent of GDP. The fall In savings was principally caused by
the large losses of state enterprises marketing petroleum, foodstuffs and
fertilizers. Import demand grew rapidly not only because of the expansionary
financing of public sector deficits, but also because of the sharp increase
in food and petroleum imports and because the new investments (mainly in
petroleum and mining) had a high import content.   Net long-term capital in-
flows totalled an estimated $1.1 billion in 1975, but were not sufficient to
finance the current account deficit and net international reserves fell from
$680 million in December 1974 to around $127 million in December 1975 equiva-
lent to less than three weeks of merchandise imports.



- 3 -
8.        This year will be a difficult one for Peru's finances.    By March
15, 1976, although gross international reserves were still around $440 mil-
lion, net international reserves had become negative by about $110 million.
A viable financial position will require import cuts since: (a) terms of
trade are not llkely to improve in 1976, while the volume of exports will
remain well below the 1972 level; and (b) Peru may have difficulties In
obtaining substantial additional funds from commercial sources. Both the
President and the Minister of Finance in -recent public statements have under-
lined the seriousness of the economic and financial difficulties and have
emphasIzed,the need to increase both domestic savings and labor productivity.
This has been reflected in a series of measures approved this year. On
January 10, 1976 a package of measures was approved aimed at reducing the
public sector deficit, discouraging imports and stimulating agricultural
production.  Partly because of these measures, the public sector's overall
deficit may fall from 10.9 percent of GDP in 1975 to 8.1 percent in 1976.
However, since a substantial unfinanced gap of approximately 1 percent of GDP
would have remained for 1976, on May 19, 1976 the government approved addi-
tional,tax measures that include: (a) increasing the rates of the sales
tax (from 17 to 20% for the general rate and from 27 to 40% for the rate
on luxury goods); (b) tripling the taxes on yearly automobile registration;
(c) increasing the rate of the cigarette sales tax from 67 to 72.5%; and
(d) reducing the exemptions of import duties on capital goods. Moreover,
the government announced that still further measures to restrict demand
would be taken during the next few weeks. In April the mining and fisheries
sectors were declared in a state of emergency; amonig other things this effec-
tively prohibits strikes. More recently, the President has also emphasized
the importance of a dynamic private sector and the need for a more stable
environment that would.enhance the investment climate. In addition, the tax
rebates on non-tradltional exports were increased in early May to a maximum of
62%.
9.        On March 3 the IMF approved SDR 97.3 million (approximately $112.5
million) of financial assistance (first credit tranche and oil facility) on
the basis of a letter of Intent which refers to additional measures to reduce
the public sector deficit and increase interest rates and puts ceilings on
credit to the private and public sectors. On April 16, an additional
SDR 61.5 million of financial assistance was approved by the IMF under the
compensatory financing scheme.
10.       During 1968-70 commitments of medium- and long-term loans to the
public sector averaged less than $200 million annually. Thereafter, they
rose sharply to an annual average of almost $1.1 billion in 1973-74 and
$0.9 billion in 1975. The rapid increase was mainly the result of the
sharp increase in public investment and during 1974-75 large requirements
of commercial borrowing for balance of payments support.
11.       While total public sector external debt (outstanding and disbursed)
more than tripled between 1970 and 1975 -- from $0.9 billion to $3.6 billion --
average terms deteriorated markedly. Average maturities fell from 17 years
in 1970 to 14.3 years in 1974, since over 65 percent of net disbursements



-4-
durlng 1970-74 came from commercial banks. During 1975, the situation
worsened since commercial banks continued to account for about 70 percent
of net disbursements while their terms hardened. The average terms in
1975 of commitments from commercial banks were: 5.8 years maturity (in-
cluding 2.3 years of grace) and 9.5 percent interest rate. This,situation
reafflrms the Bank's assessment, endorsed by the conclusions of the last
Consultative Group Meeting in April 1975, that the resource transfer
required to support the country's development program is not likely to be
achieved at adequate terms If all external lending from official sources is
restricted to the foreign exchange component of projects suitable for ex-
ternal financing.
12.       The public debt service ratio rose from 22 percent in 1974 to an
estimated 30 percent in 1975 reflecting both a sharp Increase in interest
payments and the decline in the value of merchandise exports. During 1976
the public debt service ratio is expected to fall to 26 percent because of
the expected recovery in exports and a small decrease in debt service pay-
ments. However, given the very serious foreign liquidity squeeze the country
is now going through, this level of debt service will place a heavy burden
on the balance of payments. The Government has committed itself to give
first priority in foreign exchange allocation to debt service payments.
During 1977-80 the public debt service ratio may rise further to 35 percent,
but would decline in the 1980s if the government is successful in increasing
national savings and stimulating nontraditional exports and if more suitable
lending terms are obtained in future years.
13.       Peru is a country with some very serious constraints to its devel-
opment efforts but also with a large untapped resource potential. The Govern-
ment is trying to accelerate growth while broadening the participation of
the population in the development process. It has been caught by a short-
term financial squeeze at a time when some of the unavoidable negative effects
of the structural transformation were being felt. Consequently, the present
situation is difficult. The Government is aware of these difficulties and is
determined to resolve them. The President has called for a process of con-
solidation and re-examination of social and economic policies. Improvements
in the balance of payments position during 1977 and thereafter will depend on:
(a) continued efforts to increase savings, contain import growth and reduce
dependence on foreign borrowing; (b) reducing dependence on imported petro-
leum with the completion of the oil pipeline and with addltional petroleum
exploration; and (c) Increasing export volume with the timely completion of
mining projects now underway and -- since it is now unlikely that Peru will
become a substantial net exporter of petroleum in the foreseeable future --
the expansion of nontraditional exports. On the basis that such Improvements
will take place, Peru will continue to be creditworthy for Bank lending.
The Bank both as a lender and as chairman of the Consultative Group will
continue to monitor developments closely.



PART II - BANK OPERATIONS IN PERU
14.       The Bank has made 30 loans in Peru for a total amount of $470.7
million, net of cancellations. Of this amount 47 percent has been for
transportation (mainly hlghways and ports), 22 percent for electric power,
17 percent for agriculture, 9 percent for mining and industry, and about
5 percent for education.
15.       IFC commitments to date have been about $24.0 million ($15 mil-
lion to Southern Peru Copper Corporation for the Cuajone Copper mining
project and the rest all in industry) of which $15.3 million is held by
the Corporation. Project execution has been generally satisfactory.
Annex II contains a statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of
February 29, 1976, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
16.       On July 25, 1975, the Government nationalized the assets of the
Marcona Mining Company in Peru without making provision for the payment of
compensation. Subsequent negotiations between the Company and the Government
did not reach a conclusion and the matter was taken up for negotiations
between the United States and the Peruvian Governments. Substantial pro-
gress is being made in these negotiations and an agreement Is expected to
be signed in the near future. I intend to review further progress made
on this matter prior to presentation to the Board of other loans now at an
advanced stage of consideration (see paragraph 18 below).
17.       The Bank plans to assist the Government in achieving its economic
and social development goals by aiding in: (a) the expansion of productive
capacity in crucial sectors; (b) the creation of a physical and social infra-
structure capable of sustaining and fostering the evolution of the nation's
productive capacity; and (c) the consolidation of structural and Institutional
reform which will help the socioeconomic transformation now underway. The
Bank also expects to continue to play a role in coordinating external assist-
ance and being a catalyst for new sources of funds for major investment
projects through the mechanism of the Consultative Group.
18.       The Bank's program in agriculture has a two-fold objective:
to raise the standard of living of the large'rural population of the high-
lands (sierra) and-to Increase food production. Following up on the agricul-
tural sector mission which visited the country in 1974, Bank staff and the
Bank/FAO Cooperative Program are assisting the Government in the preparation
of projects for-rural development in the Sierrra and irrigation rehabilita-
tion in the coastal area; a first irrigation rehabilitation project is being
appraised by the Bank. Also, a DFC project is currently being appraised.
In addition, the Bank has identified other projects in the water supply and
transport sectors. Bank loans to Peru constituted about 6.0 percent of
total outstanding debt, including undisbursed, at the end' of 1975, and ab-
sorbed 4.0 percent of the country's external debt service obligations in 1975.
With the increasingly active lending to Peru, the Bank's share in the country's
total outstanding debt is expected to increase but not to exceed 9 percent
by the end of 1980.

PART III - IJRBANIZATION IN PERU
Urban Growth
19.       Traditionally, net migratory movements in Peru have been from the
highlands to the coastal area mainly as a result of the pressure of a fast
population growth in the highlands, where the arable land Is limited, and
of the governmental policies for rapid industrialization which have favored
the urban centers. While Peru's population has increased at 3.1 percent per
annum, the urban population has increased at 5.1 percent per annum. A large
proportion of the population moving to the coast has traditionally settled
in Lima, although other urban centers, Piura, Arequipa, Trujillo, Chiclayo,
Chimbote and Ica have also experienced significant population increases
through migration. Estimates are that Peru's population will increase from
14.1 million in 1972 to 27.2 million in 1990. The urban population as a whole
is projected to increase from 8.4 to 18 million and Lima's population alone
from 3.6 to 8.1 million over the same period.
Pueblos Jovenes
20.       An increasing number of the people who migrate to the coastal cities
live In what has been called Pueblos Jovenes (literally "Young Settlements").
These are population settlements which are established by organized occupa-
tion 1/ of public land, generally in the outskirts of the cities. The popu-
lation of Pueblos Jovenes is largely made up of families with young children,
and living conditions are poor compared to those of all but the worst inner
city slums of Metropolitan Lima and other centers around which they are
located. The population in Pueblos Jovenes has been increasing at 13.7 per-
cent per year in the last decade. In 1975 it is estimated that about 2.4 mil-
lion people lived in Pueblos Jovenes, of which 1.5 million were in the Lima
Metropolitan Area and about 200,000 in,Arequipa.
21.       Because of the present magnitude and expected continuing increase
of their population, Pueblos Jovenes have become a social and political factor
in the policies of the Peruvian government, which has tried to mobilize their
latent potential into constructive activities. Pueblos Jovenes gained
legal status by Law of February 14, 1961. The Government also began In 1963
a program to legalize land tenure of Pueblos Jovenes residents and the pre-
sent government has accelerated this effort. The legalization of ownership
has fostered a sense of community and encouraged the planning efforts of
the residents. A local self-government system has evolved focusing in
successive stages on (a) organized land invasion, (b) economic development
1/   In general, prior to land occupation, a group of squatters form an
association (called Organizacion Vecinal or neighborhood organization)
to organize the settlement, plan the land use, and allot to each family a
plot of land.  The association represents its members before government
agencies for the legalization of the settlement and for the installation
of urban services and community facilities.



- 7 -
through the creation of cooperatives, (c) urban community social develop-
ment, and (d) self-managed communal social, economic, and administrative
development. The structure of self-government within the Pueblos Jovenes
has been formalized, and the Peruvian Government has given acceptability as
well as promotion and direction to the institutions of the Pueblos Jovenes
through the establishment, in April 1972, of the Sistema Nacional de Apoyo a
la Movilizacion Social (SINAMOS) an agency for support of social mobilization.
Through SINAMOS, the Pueblos Jovenes have made their priorities known to the
Government and have made it clear that they attach a much higher prlority to
job creation than to housing. Other basic requirements urgently called for
at this time include the upgrading of services, particularly water supply.
National Urban Policies and Programs
22.       National urban development programs and related infrastructure
investments are coordinated through the Ministry of Housing and Construc-
tion, which is responsible for the formulation of policy, preparation of
urban plans and coordination of public and private housing investments, as
well as for government investments in general construction, water and
sewerage, and infrastructure for low-income areas. Apart from the formula-
tion and subsequent approval by Government of a long-range National Urban
Development Plan to establish 13 urban industrial centers throughout the
country and thus to deal with the excessive concentration of population in
Lima, the Government is also actively engaged in short term programs - such
as the ones under this project - designed to alleviate the current plight of
the large and growing number of Peru's urban poor.
23.       Present Government programs to upgrade Pueblos Jovenes include
credits to individual residents for housing construction and/or materials;
loans for sewerage, water, and electric connections within Pueblos Jovenes,
to be amortized, along with construction costs, through bills for service
to individuals on a monthly basis; improvement of roads both within the
community and outside to connect it with employment areas; construction and
staffing of health facilities; and building of schools and community centers.
24.       The underlying policy of these programs Is to keep costs to a
level compatible with the principle of cost recovery and the capacity of the
Pueblos Jovenes residents. Consequently, the use of self-help and mutual
aid to Pueblos Jovenes dwellers constitutes a major factor in all construc-
tion and public works activities within the communities.
25.       In. addition, the Government is committed to the difficult task
of generating employment opportunities and income in Pueblos Jovenes. To
that end plans have been formulated for the creation of industrial zones
within .elected Pueblos Jovenes by providing the basic infrastructure
required for the settlement of small and medium-size industrles. The
industries proposed for Pueblos Jovenes are designed to have major employ-
ment-creating effects and are to be mostly - but not exclusively - worker-



-8-
managed enterprises set up under the social-property system. 1/ Under this
scheme, Initial capital Is provided by the National Social Property Fund;
the enterprise is then assigned an annual contribution to the Fund to be paid
through the life of the enterprise. The response to these programs for the
establishment of industries in Pueblos Jovenes is encouraging if judged
by the number and quality of proposals submitted to the National Social
Property Fund for consideration. In conjunction with the establishment
of industrial zones, the Government is establishing regional vocational
training centers through SENATI (National Service for Training in Industry)
to provide the skills needed in small and medium-size industries best suited
to Pueblos Jovenes. In Lima, plans include the development of five new
Industrial zones which would provide an estimated 275,000 new jobs In manufac-
turing by 1980. Industrial parks are planned in 13 different cities in the
National Urban Development Plan. Further public investments projected in this
Plan are intended to provide employment for about 16% of the estimated Increase
in Peru's economically active population during the plan period, creating a
total of 680,000 new jobs.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
26.       The proposed project was Identified, within the Government pro-
grams for improving the living conditions of the urban poor in the country,
in November 1974, and subsequently prepared by Government, with assistance
provided by the Bank in the course of two preparation missions in April and
August 1975. The project was appraised in November 1975 and negotiations were
held in Washington in May 10-14, 1976; the Banco de la Vivienda delegation was
led by Mr. Victor de Castro, Director General, and the Government was repre-
sented by Dr. Ulises Montoya, Executive Director of Public credit in the
Ministry of-Economy and Finance. A Loan and Project Summary is attached as
Annex III.
Description
27.       The proposed project is an integral part of the Government's
program aimed at providing the urban poor with basic facilities and employ-
ment opportunities to increase their capacity to be absorbed productively
in the urban economy. The project focuses on three areas of assistance--
1/   The Empresa de Propiedad Social (ESP) is a novel form of industrial
ownership system developed by Peru's Revolutionary Government. It is
still largely in an incipient and experimental phase; the longer term
intention is that it is to coexist with private and public ownership
in manufacturing, agriculture and the service industrles. It is
basically an attempt to create worker managed and owned enterprises,
and to tap the entrepreneurial capacity of large groups - individual
workers' ownership rights are not transferable and cease with their
employment in an ESP enterprise.



-9-
infrastructure, productive Investment, and technical assistance--and instl-
tutionalizes a delivery system for urban services to low-income areas. The
project would consist of:
(a) Infrastructure:
(i)  water and sewerage for Pueblos Jovenes in Lima and
Arequipa provlding about 7,200 household connections;
(ii)  electrification of 16,300 households in Pueblos
Jovenes in Lima and Arequipa;
(iii)  access roads of 86.1 km to connect Pueblos Jovenes
to main roads and upgrade existing roads in these
settlements in Lima; and
(iv)  health and nutritlon centers in Pueblos Jovenes in
Lima.
(b) Productive investments:
(i) industrial sites and services (about 63.5 ha) in
Lima and Arequipa;
(ii) housing and commercial sites and services in Lima; and
(iii) supervised credit in Arequipa.
(c) Technical assistance:
(i)  to establish a unit in the Ministry of Housing
and Construction to assist settlers primarlly in
self-help construction;
(ii)  to provide advisory assistance for the planning,
management and monitoring of the industrial sites
and services in Lima;
(Iil)  to assist in the review of plans and in the pre-
paration of a water supply and sewerage project
in Arequipa;
(iv)  to provide advisory assistance as well as vehicles
and equipment for the development of a training
program for community health and nutrition in
Puebl6s Jovenes; and
(v)  to assist the Banco de la Vivienda del Peru in
overall project implementation, financial plan-
ning and related studies for the mobilization of
additional resources for urban development
program and future projects.



- 10 -
28.       Banco de la Vivienda del Peru (BVP) would be the executing agency
for the project. BVP would enter into contractual arrangements satisfactory
to the Bank, with participating agencies (see below, Paragraphs 19-20) for
speciflc project components as needed (Section 3.02 of draft Loan Agreement).
These contractual arrangements will spell out the responsibilities of the
respective agencies, with regard to the project. The Government will bear
the exchange risk of the proposed Bank loan to BVP (Section 3.04 of draft
Guarantee Agreement). BVP, assisted by the consultant services financed
under the project, will have the technlcal and administrative capacity to
carry out the project efficiently. To help ensure a smooth, and continuous
flow of financial resources during project execution, and particularly to
facilitate the participation of small contractors with limited financial
backing, BVP will establish a revolving fund with an initial sum of at
least US$500,000 equivalent from which it wlll make disbursements directly
to contractors (Section 3.05 of draft Loan Agreement). This fund will be
replenished by disbursements to It by the Bank and Government. The establish-
ment of the fund would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
The establishment of a Technical Assistance Unit within the Ministry of
Housing and-Construction to assist settlers in the construction of dwelling
units or shops/stores, would also be a condition of effectiveness. The pro-
ject is expected to be completed by December 31, 1979.
The Borrower
29.       Banco de la Vivienda del Peru is a state owned semi-autonomous
company which was created in 1962 to establish and administer savings and
loan associations. The savings and loan system has 17 associations with
IIS$172 million (1973) in savings and has been one of the most successful
in Latin America. In 1969 it received authority to mobilize funds (through
Issuance of mutual development bonds) and to extend credits for housing and
construction, including lending to housing cooperatives and public and
private developers, lending for direct programs or urban renewal and rede-
velopment in poor areas, and lending for experimental projects. Total assets
as at December 31, 1974, amounted to S/. 5,743 million ($127.0 million);
share capital reserves and retained earnings amounted to SI. 1,017 million
($22.6 million), long-term debt to S/. 3,063 million ($68 million), and
deposits and accounts payable to S/. 1,294 million and S!. 367.4 million,
respectively ($28.7 million and $8.1 million). BVP accounts for about 40%
of total housing investment by housing finance institutions. Past finan-
cial performance of BVP has been good; of the loans made as of December 31,
1974, only about 5% were in arrears; the amount in arrears represent about
1.5% of the loan portfolio. Operating income, which has been declining in
recent years because of greater use of long-term debt rather than deposits,
thus increasing the borrowing cost, has nonetheless been sufficient to provide
BVP with a positive net income. Financial performance is expected to improve
in the future as net lending is forecast to increase from S/. 3,455 million to
S/. 8,326 million in 1980 with a better interest spread on this lending.

30.       BVP is managed by an eight-member board (four members represent-
ing the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and four representing the Ministry
of Housing and Construction) headed by a president, who also acts as Chairman
of the Board. The present chairman is a banker with more than 25 years of
experience. The senior staff and middle management personnel are suitably
qualified and experienced. Operations are directed by a General Manager,
working through four Central Managers: administration, commercial credit,
operations (medium- and long-term credit) and supervision. In addition,
each of the departments may draw as needed on the services of fout advisory
departments (economic, legal, management and technical) for specific exper-
tise in special situations as they arise. Of particular importance at
this time is the technical department which will be strengthened both in
numbers and technical capability to fulfill the demands that will be put
upon it as BVP expands its activities in large-scale programs of low-cost
housing and related Infrastructure; it has been agreed that at least four
additional technicians be employed In this department (Section 4.02(b) of
the draft Loan.Agreement), and that the employment of such technicians be
a condition of effectiven-ess of the loan.
The Participatlng Agencies
31.       The components of the proposed project involving substantial
self help, particularly water supply and electrification in both Lima
and Arequipa and supervised credit in Arequipa, have been organized by
SINAMOS. The plans submitted to BVP by SINAMOS for these components con-
tain the names of at least 70% of the families who will participate in them.
SINAMOS also recommended the authority, i.e. the ministry or regional agency,
which should execute each plan and be responsible for collections. After
BVP's technical department reviews the plan and evaluates its feasibility,
BVP signs a contract with the authority, whlch becomes the supervisor,
executor and collector for the loan.
32.       A summary follows of the principal ministries and agencles whlch
will aid BVP in carrying out the various subprojects:
(a) Water Supply and Sewerage - ESAL and ESAR in Lima and Arequipa
respectively.
(b) Electrification - ELECTROPERU and ELECTROLIMA in Lima and
SINAMOS and SEAL In Arequipa.
(c)  Access Roads - The Ministry of Housing and Construction.
(d) Health and Nutrition Centers.- The Ministry of Health.
(e) Industrial Sites and Services - The Ministry of Housing
and Construction and EMADI, a real estate public enter-
prise under the Ministry.
(f)  Housing and Commercial Sites and Services in Lima - The
Ministry of Housing and Construction.



- 12 -
(g) Arequipa Industrial Sites and Services - The Ministry of
Housing and Construction and EMADI.
(h) Supervised Credit In Arequipa - SINAMOS.
These ministries and agencies have effectively managed substantial programs
of similar types in the past and are expected to carry out thelr respective
parts of the project efficiently under contracts to be signed with BVP.
Estlmated Cost and Financing
33.       The total cost of the project, inclusive of land cost and con-
tingencies, is estimated at $43.2 million of which about 35%, or $15.2 mil-
lion, represents the foreign exchange component. The summary table below
shows the costs of the various elements of the project:

34.       The proposed $21.6 million loan would finance 50% of the total
project costs, i.e. the foreign exchange component of the project plus $6.4
mlllion of local currency costs. (See para. 11 above for a general justif-
ication of local cost financing in Peru.) The relatively low foreign exchange
component of the project (35%) and its hlgh priority make some local currency
financing in this case appropriate. The balance of the project costs will
be financed by Banco de la Vivienda ($19.1 million of which $12.9 million
will be provided by Government to BVP in the form of equity contribution)
and down payments from project beneficiaries ($2.5 million).

Cost Recovery and Relending
35.       It is an accepted principle in Peru that investments made for
the improvement of the living conditions of Pueblos Jovenes are to be
recovered from the beneflciaries Insofar as feasible. The proposed project
would not be an exception to this general rule; recovery of costs for the
project would come mainly from flnal users. In this connection BVP will
relend a portion of the proceeds of the loan to individual households to
finance (a) 90% of their portion of project costs related to water supply
and sewerage (mainly tertiary distribution and household connections);
(b) 90% of their portion of project costs related to electrification (low
voltage networks and home connections); (c) 90% of their portion of project
costs related to construction and development of sites and services, and
construction of core dwelling units and core shop/stores in Lima; and
(d) the construction of core housing units in Arequipa, within a framework
of mutual aid, through supervised credit.
36.       These subloans to individual households, which represent about two
thirds of the loan, would be made for 20 years at an annual interest of at
least 12%, except electrification where subloans would be made for ten years
(Section 3.04 of draft Loan Agreement). These interest rates are negative in
real terms at the hlgh current rate of inflation but appear acceptable in view
of the high priority social objectives for which the loans are being made and
because it is expected that inflation will subside early enough to ensure
positive real rates over the life of the subloans. Moreover, the proposed
rates are consistent with the Pueblos Jovenes dwellers' current capacity to
repay the loans. The spread between the proposed Bank loan terms and BVP's
average relending terms is considered sufficient to cover administrative costs
and to generate a surplus. Small surpluses would also be generated because of
the somewhat shorter average grace period and repayment term on BVP loans to
indlviduals than on the Bank loan. The surpluses would be relent for projects
similar to the ones financed under the proposed loan (Section 3.06 of the
draft Loan Agreement).
37.       A portion of the loan, mainly for major construction works, would be
relent by BVP to other Peruvian agencies on-the same terms as the Bank loan.
These loans will be mainly to ESAL to finance water supply works in Lima and
to EMADI to aid in financing infrastructure in Arequipa and Lima.    BVP will
also make available part of the loan to finance construction to be carried out
by the Ministries of Housing and Health and for technical assistance; BVP will
be reimbursed these amounts by the Government.
38.       More than two thirds of the project costs will be recovered
through repayments of loans by individual beneficiaries or Government
agencies. Increased tax revenues will also occur as the income earnings
capaclty of the Pueblos Jovenes dwellers rises as an outgrowth of the
project.

Procurement and Disbursement
39.       Contracts for civil works and equipment would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank guide-
lines, except for up to $240,000 worth of locally manufactured equipment and
electrical facilities, because Peruvian legislation effectively prevents
international competitive bidding for Industrial products manufactured in
Peru, as well as for reasons of efficiency, standardization and avallabllity
of repair facilities. Building materials provided by BVP to individuals to
upgrade or erect modest shelter units through a program of mutual aid will
also be procured on the basis of domestic competitive bidding because of the
small size of contracts and the nature of the materlals.
40.       Disbursements would be made on the following basis:    (a) 100% of the
CIF cost of imported vehicles and equipment; (b) 48% of the cost of civil
works and buildings; (c) 50% of the cost of consultants' services; and (d) 50%
of disbursements made by BVP under the supervised credit component. Disburse-
ments would be made for expenditures incurred after December 1, 1975, for
consultants' services for the preparation of detailed engineering of the
proposed works. The amount of this retroactive flnancing would not exceed
$100,000. Based on the project execution schedule, the proposed loan would
be fully disbursed by June 30, 1980.
Justification
41.       The primary objective of the project is to contribute to the econo-
mic and social advancement of residednts of Pueblos Vovenes. The various
components of the project will extend essential services, provide basic employ-
ment and training and increase the productivity of the urban poor. It is
expected that about 6,000 new permanent jobs will be created by encouraging
the establishment of small- and medium-size industries in the Industrial sites
to be provided under the project, together with the provision of industrial
training and capital provided under broader government schemes (see para. 25).
42.       Many of the benefits of the project, such as improved health, com-
fort and social well being of the community, cannot be quantified. Other
benefits, such as reduced cost of services to be provided (water supply sys-
tem and electricity) or savings for road users of the new access roads, etc.,
which are quantifiable have been compared with the present costs to consumers
of alternatives now available, and appear to be substantial. The average rate
of return for these components, which represent over 90% of the project cost,
has been estimated at 30%, the lowest rate of return for individual components
being over 17%. Sensitivity analysis to cost increases by 15% or benefits
decreases by 15% show that such variations would have a limited effect on the
estimated rate of return for the project which would still remain over 26%.
It is to be recognized, however, that these rate of return calculations re-
present only rough orders of magnitude since they are in part based on the
assumption that prices currently paid by consumers and to be paid for services
to be provided under the project reflect their long-term marginal costs and
substantial uncertainties exist regarding these costs.



- 15 -
413.      An important unquantifiable benefit of this project is that it
represents a -step forward in the Government's objective of trying to reduce
investment costs significantly so that the number of Pueblos Jovenes resident-
benefitting under this type of scheme can be substantially Increased. In tl,.
proposed project the average per capita cost of providing 7,200 water and
11,()000sewer connections - exclusive of water production costs - is abovut
Sll0; tlhe average per capita cost of providing 16,300 electricity connection;
is ihout '(30: and the investment to be made in access roads would amount to
about $16 per capita. Under the supervised credit component of the project
the cost per household plot, (i.e.' with water, electricity, sewerage and
ac(:ess roads) and a simple core dwelling unit will amount to about $1,400,
which cotuld be obtained by the beneficiary with a down payment of about $140
and a monthly payment of $14, which Is affordable by the lowest 20th per-
centile in the income distribution curve. These costs compare favorably
with those of most other Latin American countries and, particularly, with
the cost of dwelling units under a previous program undertaken by BVP in
1974 with foreign assistance, which was about $7,400, a price only accessible
to middle-income-families. Apart from making savings in design standards
and methods of construction which have been determined with the active parti-
cipation of the communities served, one other important reason for these reason-
able costs is the use of self-help and mutual aid by the beneficiarles which
the project will help foster. This system of self-help and mutual aid will
aLso generate about 13,000 man-months of employment in the course of imple-
mentation of the project. Because of the low per capita costs fpr improving
existing dwellings by providing basic services or construction of core dwel-
ling units and community facilities the 200,000 Pueblos Jovenes resldents will
be directly affected one way or another by the project. This Is a modest
number if compared with the existing Pueblos Jovenes population In Lima and
Arequipa, but the project Is expected to make a major contribution by promo-
ting further investments, on the basis of low cost, self-help schemes in other
areas of Lima and Arequipa'and elsewhere in the country. This will be aided
by the institution-building aspects of the project through improving the
"delivery system" for urban servlces to low income areas by establishing more
eEfective working arrangements between Banco de la Vivienda and Governmental
agencies to provide capital investment funds for thls purpose.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
44.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Banco de la Vivienda
del Peru, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Peru and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of the draft resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
45.       The draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements conform to the normal
pattern for loans for sites and services projects. Two special conditions
to the effectiveness of the Loan (the establishment of a revolving fund and
the establislhment of a Technical Assistance Unit within the Ministry of



- 16 -
Housing and Construction) are mentioned in paragraph 28 and one (the employ-
ment of four additional technicians by Banco de la Vivienda) is mentioned in
paragraph 30 of this report and reflected In Section 7.01 of the draft Loan
Agreement.
46.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
47.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /
Loan No. 418-PE: San Lorenzo Irrigation Project; US$11 million Loan of June
lo, 1965;  Effective Date: November 2, 1965;    Closing
Date: June 30, 1976
Because of inadequacy of water supply, the Bank agreed to reduce the
project area; consequently, the project was redefined and the original loan amount
of US$11.0 million was reduced to US$6.5 million. (See Memorandum to the Executive
Directors "Peru; Proposed Change in Loan 418-PE", February 28, 1968-33). The
Closing Date, originally June 20, 1967, was postponed four times, first to June 30,
1969, then to December 31, 1973, then to December 31, 1974, and then to June 30,
1976. The last postponement of the Closing Date was granted to allow the Borrower
to use the undisbuarsed amount of the loan (US$350,000) for the replacement of a
valve at the San Lorenzo reservoir, which is important for the overall operation

progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

of the system.  The project has encountered a number of difficulties, both
administrative and technical but these problems are being overcome. Project
management has been strengthened and the last part of the project related to the
drainage scheme is progressing satisfactorily.   The Loan is expected to be fully
disbursed by the revised Closing Date.
Loan 706-PE: Road Reconstruction Project; US$30 million Loan of September 14.
1970; Effective Date: October 26, 1970; Closing Date: March 31, 1977
This Loan was signed only three and a half months after the earthquake
in the Callejon de Huaylas. However, the identification, feasibility study and
final engineering of the roads to be improved have taken much longer than expected
because of a too optimistic assessment at the time of appraisal, because of
administrative and coordination difficulties in connection with the on-going
decentralization of the Central Government, and because of problems with the
consultants engaged to study and supervise the project. Construction of a short
section of road near Huaraz, the capital of the region, is near completion. Work
is well advanced on the two remaining sections along the Callejon; bidding for
the access road has now taken place and construction of this last section has
also started. The road reconstruction element of the project is expected to be
completed by the end of 1976, 15 months later than the original Closing Date of
the Loan, which has been extended accordingly.
Loan 933-PE: Agricultural Credit Project; US$25.0 million Loan of September
12, 1973; Effective Date: December 12, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
The Loan was signed in September 1973 and became effective on December
12, 1973. Although the project had a slow start, progress is now satisfactory.
Disbursements are slightly behind schedule.
Loan 949-PE: Education Project; U $24.0 million Loan of December 5, 1973;
Jfective Date: March 5, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This Loan became effective on March 5, 1974. Serious initial delays
were caused by administrative difficulties with the Project Unit and late appointment
of counterpart staff to the consultants who were to define curricula for the ESEPs
(Escuelas Saperiores de Ensenanza Profesional). The recent change of status of the
Project Unit which has been upjgraded to the rank of Directorate General and the
strengthened management of the project have markedly improved the prospects for
efficient implementation of the project.
Loan 1025-PE: Sixth Highway Project; US$26 million Loan of July 1, 1974;
Effective Date: August 21, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Bids for construction works were invited in October 1974, on the basis
of the official cost estimates, but contractors failed to respond. After an
upward revision of the cost estimates new invitations to bid were issued in March
1975. Contractors response this time has been positive and bids for all sections
have been submitted and contracts were awarded in August 1975. Project
implementation is eight to ten months behind schedule.
