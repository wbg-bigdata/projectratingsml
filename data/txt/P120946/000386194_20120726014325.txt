F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The main objective of the program is to support modern governance, one of the four pillars of
Vietnam‘s Socio-economic Development Plan 2006-10 (SEDP). Specifically, this operation was
designed to assist the Government of Vietnam to strengthen the selection, preparation,
implementation and supervision of public investment projects. With the country facing enormous
demand for infrastructure development, the public investment management (PIM) cycle plays a
key role in ensuring effective translation of resources into improved service delivery. Poor project
preparation and screening, excessive environmental damage and adverse social impacts, fiduciary
risks and pervasive conflict of interest, and an insufficiently developed framework for private
participation in infrastructure have undermined the efficiency of public investments in Vietnam.
These weaknesses need to be addressed regardless of whether projects are funded by the budget
or by development partners (DPs). At the same time, improving the PIM cycle is expected to
result in higher disbursement rates for all public projects including those funded by DPs.
Upgrading country systems in areas such as public financial management, procurement and
safeguards is also expected to pave the way for their gradual use in DPs-funded projects, on a
pilot basis. Another important objective of this program was to facilitate infrastructure
development in Vietnam by developing basic legal framework for Public-Private Partnership
(PPP) projects.

Revised Program Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDO was not revised. However, one Outcome Indicator, namely the number of FDI firms re-
registered under the new Enterprise Law became irrelevant as the Government went beyond the
reform measure proposed in the operation. Decree 102, issued in October 2010, effectively
removed the constraints facing FDI enterprises to be re-registered in expanding their operations
beyond their license that was granted before the 2005 Enterprise Law. The indicator therefore
was no longer valid and hence dropped from the operation. The intended objective of the policy
action was however achieved.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      The Public Investment Reform Development Policy programmatic series was prepared in
response to a request from the Government of Vietnam (GoV) to finance the government‘s fiscal
stimulus package, announced at the height of the global economic crisis in 2009. While the
immediate intention was to help Vietnam avoid the adverse fall-outs of the crisis, the objective of
the operation was to address weaknesses in the public investment cycle, a key long-term goal of
the GoV. Vietnam has been trying to move from an economic growth model that is largely based
on capital accumulation, which is unsustainable given the already high rates of investments, to
one based on improving the efficiency and productivity of capital. Increasing the efficiency and
productivity of investment had been identified as a high priority in prior analytical work, most
notably the 2009 Vietnam Development Report Capital Matters, and then on-going dialogue
under the PRSC series. It was also an emerging priority in the Socio-Economic Development
Strategy (SEDS) 2011-20, the Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006-10, and the
SEDP 2011-15. Since the stimulus measures announced to offset the impact of global economic
crisis was expected to lead to a big boost in public investment, strengthening the PIM cycle
became imperative. The operations, therefore, sought to take advantage of the greater attention of
the senior leadership on this issue, brought on by the global crisis, to gain some reform
momentum in this area.

2.       The global economic crisis led to a sharp slowdown in economic growth and export in
Vietnam in late 2008 and early 2009. The first quarter growth of 2009 was merely 3.1 percent –
the lowest growth rate on record since the beginning of the 1990s. There were concerns that
millions of workers in the export sector would lose jobs, their families would fall into poverty and
some of the developmental gains of the past decades could be reversed. While Vietnam did have
the requisite fiscal space to undertake a large stimulus measure, the global situation did not permit
it to borrow from the international market and funding the stimulus program by curtailing
expenditure on public services was not an acceptable solution either. Therefore, the Government
called for financial assistance from development partners (DPs). A number of DPs, including WB,
ADB, JICA, AFD, and others, provided emergency support to Vietnam – this operation being one
such example.

3.       Having agreed to provide financial support, the Bank decided to use the operation to
support government‘s effort to improve the effectiveness of public investment – a known
weakness. With respect to the medium to long term growth agenda, there had been growing
realization in Vietnam that while the country had achieved rapid economic growth and impressive
poverty reduction over the last twenty years, the growth strategy based largely on factor
accumulation may have run its course. Vietnam has one of the highest investment rates in the
world, averaging around 43 percent of GDP during the past five years; however, the growth rate
has not been commensurate with this high investment rate. Sustaining growth at 7 to 8 percent
rate during the next decade cannot be achieved by raising the investment rate even higher.
Instead, the focus has to shift towards raising the competitiveness of economy, especially the
quality of public investment.

4.      These weaknesses ran the length of the public investment cycle. The legal framework
was fragmented with many and often inconsistent laws and decrees impacting various aspects of
public investments. With the passage of the Law on the State Budget (2002) and the Construction
Law (2003), public investment management had been decentralized to line ministries and

                                                11
provinces for most projects, with the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) responsible for
screening only large nationally important projects. This change had not been matched by building
the necessary mechanisms for project appraisal at the ministerial and, in particular, provincial
levels. The regulatory framework for private participation in infrastructure was weak and the
main reason Vietnam had been unable to attract private financing. Environmental assessments
were not adequately informing strategic planning or specific projects. Cost estimation was weak
due to rigid cost norms, and Vietnam‘s legal framework for public procurement was not aligned
to international standards.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

5.      The main objective of the program is to support modern governance, one of the four
pillars of Vietnam‘s Socio-economic Development Plan 2006-10. Specifically, the reform
supported by PIR 1 and 2 attempts to improve the effectiveness of public investment through
better project selection, implementation, financial management and oversight. The program was
organized around four main thematic areas which are essential to strengthening the public
investment project cycle:
 Project selection (competitive entry, environmental screening, project approval).
    Project implementation (cost estimates, bidding rules, bidding transparency, conflict of
     interest, dispute resolution, land acquisition, environmental management).
    Financial management (reporting and control, administrative costs, environmental budgets,
     subsidies and guarantees).
    Project oversight (project documentation, monitoring and evaluation).
Progress in these areas is expected to improve public investment processes and strengthen
country systems.
6.      A set of ten result indicators covering the aforementioned four areas of the program has
been identified (Annex 5). Given the short time span for the program, and the short time period
since effectiveness of the majorities of issued legal documents, it is difficult to have all
measurable results on the ground.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

7.       The PDO was not revised. However, one outcome indicator, the number of FDI firms re-
registered under the new Enterprise Law, was dropped as the government went beyond the reform
measure proposed in the operation. Decree 102, issued in October 2010 effectively removed the
constraints facing FDI enterprises to-be-re-registered in expanding their operations beyond their
license that were granted before the 2005 Enterprise Law. This indicator therefore became
irrelevant but the intended objective of the policy action was achieved.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

8.      The policy actions under the two operations PIR 1 and PIR 2 are organized around 17
main issues or problems to address. Those 17 issues can be regrouped under four main thematic
areas: project selection, project implementation, public financial management, and project


                                                12
oversight (Annexes 2 and 3). The policy actions under PIR2 are either complements or follow-
ups of the prior actions under PIR 1.

9.       The selected issues are complex, and solving some of them requires the issuance of
several legal documents which may require the involvement of the whole cabinet. Consequently,
the completion of some policy actions took a considerable amount of time, and demanded
concerted efforts from both sides within the short timeframe of the program.

10.      All the measures in the PIR program concern the management of public investment
projects in general, regardless of their source of funding. The project selection area covers the
issues of competitive entry, environmental screening, and project approval. The main objective of
proposed actions in this area is to improve the sustainability of and to reduce the fragmentation of
public investment. Measures in this area support the improvement of the preparation and use of
Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEAs), the re-registration of the FDI Enterprises under the
Enterprise Law 2005, and the preparation of a Law on Public Investment to provide a common
framework for all public projects. The project implementation area covers the issues of cost
estimates, bidding rules, bidding transparency, conflict of interest, dispute resolution, land
acquisition and environmental management. The important policy support in this area includes
measures to narrow the gaps between Vietnamese legal framework for public procurement and
international good practice so as to improve effectiveness and performance of public resource
management. The policy support under the financial management thematic area address the
problems in reporting and control, administrative costs, environmental budgets, payment and
disbursement procedures, subsidies and guarantees of the public investment project, especially
ODA-funded project. The measures are aimed at improving the quality of project preparation and
supervision and mobilizing resources from the private sector. Finally, project oversight area
covers the issues in project documentation and monitoring and evaluation. The key support in this
area concerns the establishment of a consistent M&E framework including standardized
monitoring tools.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

11.     The final prior actions for PIR2 differ slightly from the triggers that were initially
proposed in PIR1. Annex 4 summarizes the changes which mostly are of editorial nature to reflect
more accurately the content of the supporting documents related to the relevant policy actions. In
general, the reform objectives therefore have been kept unchanged despite the revisions.

12.      Annex 4 highlights two notable changes in the policy matrix. The most important change
relates to the submission of Public Investment Law to the National Assembly for review (Trigger
3 as in PIR1). However, the government came to a decision that further research was needed for
the formulation of this law and subsequently requested the National Assembly to withdraw the
Public Investment Law from the legislative agenda of the National Assembly in 2010. As a result,
a draft law was not submitted to the National Assembly in November 2010 for review. The
formulation of a Law on Public Investment was therefore dropped from the PIR 2 operation
despite its importance. Consequently, there are only 12 prior actions in PIR 2 operation instead of
13 as proposed in PIR 1.

13.     The second important change is the revision of trigger No.13 in PIR 1 which is now
labeled as prior action No. 12 in PIR 2 due to the droppage of the Law of Public Investment. The
original trigger required an approval of a Charter establishing an Association of Independent
Investment Evaluators. However, investment evaluator is a new profession in Vietnam.


                                                13
Therefore, establishment of a new association for investment evaluators is time consuming and
needs the establishment of a legal framework for the operation and activities of its members.
Towards the formulation of such a legal framework, the government asked MPI to issue two
Circulars to establish standard templates for project monitoring reports and set up the criteria
legally required for individuals and institutions to carry out investment evaluation. In addition,
the Circular setting up the criteria legally required for individuals and institutions to carry out
investment evaluation is the legal pre-condition needed for the approval of the concerned Charter.
The issuance of these Circulars is included as a policy action for PIR2, replacing the original
trigger of PIR1.

1.6 Other significant changes

None.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix)

14.    The PIR series consisted of two single-tranche operations: PIR 1 was US$ 500 million on
IBRD resources, and PIR 2 was US$350 million, with US$ 262.7 million from IDA and
US$ 87.3 million on IBRD funds. PIR 1 was approved by the Board in December 22, 2009 and
PIR2 was approved in May 24, 2011.

15.     The Agence Française de Développement (AFD) co-financed the series, providing EUR
100 million for PIR 1, approved on January 21, 2010 and EUR 35 million for PIR 2, approved on
May 25, 2011. AFD participated in all technical meetings and completely aligned with the policy
actions agreed between the Bank and the Government.

16.     The size of PIR 2 was reduced from the original anticipated amount of US$ 500 million
on account of: (i) the gradual and calibrated phasing out of stimulus measures resulting in a lower
than expected fiscal deficit and financing gap; (ii) the lack of fulfillment of one trigger, the
submission of the Law on Public Investments, to the National Assembly; and (iii) concern that a
second large development policy loan would quickly exhaust Vietnam‘s limited IBRD exposure.
There was a change to one other policy measure in PIR 2, namely the trigger on the approval of a
charter establishing an Association of Independent Evaluators for public investment projects was
modified to the setting of criteria for the certification of individuals and institutions to carry out
independent evaluation.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

18.     Partnership with the Government: The PIR program is well-aligned with the Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2007-11. The PIR series touched on all four pillars of the CPS: (i)
improving the business environment; (ii) strengthening social inclusion; (iii) strengthening natural
resource and environmental management; and (iv) improving governance.

19.      Overall, the program benefited considerably from the strong collaboration and trust with
the Government line ministries and agencies that had been built over the years through lending
operations, AAAs and policy dialogues. The identification of potential prior actions and triggers
for the program was primarily based on extensive review of analytical works, technical assistance,
and on-going policy dialogues between development partners and government counterparts.
Given the consultative nature of all these activities, this resulted in a high degree of consensus
and support from the counterparts for the proposed policy matrix. Further consultation of the
initial policy matrix within the country team, with six development banks and counterparts had
helped build strong consensus with all stakeholders and facilitate the implementation process
immensely.

20.     Partnership with the government ministries and agencies also proved to be a decisive
factor behind the intensive consultation and dialogue with the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) and
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in the successful formulation of the stabilization package.
Resolution 11, adopted by the government since February 2011, is a complex package including
monetary, fiscal, structural and social measures to restore macroeconomic stability. The
formulation of Resolution 11 took place during the negotiation of PIR2 and benefited from
intensive policy dialogue between the IFM and the World Bank with SBV and MOF.

21.      The PIR program also benefitted strongly from the PRSC series and its implementation
mechanism. The design of the operation drew on the lesson from the PRSC series in identifying
an area in which the leadership was keen to move, where the dialogue was well advanced, and
where capacity to develop and implement policy was in place. This strategy worked well in some
of the policy areas of the program, such as mitigating the environmental impact of projects,
compensation for affected communities, and addressing SOE restructuring, where there was
emerging interest in the Government. However, it also meant that some other important areas,
most notably procurement reform, were off the table as there was major disagreement between
the Government and the donor community on many aspects and quite a distance between the
institutional arrangements for public procurement in Vietnam and what is acceptable to the donor
community.

22.     An important factor behind the smooth implementation of the program is the coordination
role of the SBV. The SBV is also the coordinator for the PRSC series, and therefore is very
experienced in effective arrangements of activities needed for budget support operations.
Successful implementation of the PIR program despite short preparatory period of time can
largely be attributed to the reliance on the PRSC implementation mechanism and strong
commitments of all government counterparts, especially from the SBV.

23.      Government Ownership of the Program: Consultative nature of activities of development
partners that secure active participation or leading role of government counterparts imply that the
policy matrix was part of Government‘s own reform program. There was also high level of
attention on the program preparation and implementation from the Prime Minister, the Deputy
Prime Minister, the Governor of the SBV, and relevant Sectoral Ministers. In particular the

                                                16
measures taken to stabilize the economy in 2011 with the approval of Resolution 11 by the Prime
Minister speak to the high level of ownership. However, there were also some notable
disagreements between key Government agencies, institutional fragmentation, and unwillingness
to relinquish strong controls that compromised the effectives of several key measures. Lack of
consensus within the Government on this complex issue was a key factor leading to the delay in
submitting the Law on Public Investments. The very institutional fragmentation that this Law is
meant to address also implied that MPI and/or MOF could not adequately enforce some the
provisions such as on the use of independent evaluators or adequate incorporation of
environmental impact assessments in project appraisal. The lack of flexibility on cost norms by
the MOF also meant that the problem of unrealistic cost estimates was not properly solved.

24.      Collaboration with other Development Partners: The Bank has an active dialogue and
worked together with the IMF country teams for Vietnam on a range of macroeconomic and
structural issues. They have coordinated their macroeconomic policy messages to the authorities.
The two teams also work together on a number of issues such as surveillance of macroeconomic
situation, joint Debt Sustainability Analysis, technical assistance for financial sector reform,
preparatory work for FSAP, public financial management and tax and customs modernization
reform, preparation of the Bank‗s semi-annual economic update. The collaboration of the Bank
and the IMF was very fruitful in helping the Government in the formulation of Resolution 11 and
in the preparation of FSAP.

25.      Besides the IMF, the World Bank worked closely with the other five development banks
active in Vietnam to select the set of policy actions among the joint action plans for improvement
of performance on ODA projects and programmes among the Government and the six
development banks, namely AFD, ADB, the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA),
the Korean Development Bank, and the German Kreditanstalt Für Wiederaufbau (KfW). In the
process, it led to a deep understanding of current weaknesses in project preparation, selection,
implementation and monitoring in Vietnam. Active consultation with other donors and with non-
government actors also took place as part of analytical work underpinning this program.

26.      The program strongly benefitted from close collaboration between the Bank task team
and the task team of the co-financier, Agence Française de Développement (AFD). Good labor
division and frequent interactions between two task teams took place throughout the program
preparation, implementation and evaluation. One of the two teams took lead in technical meetings
for the prior actions and the other team actively participated and provided technical inputs for the
formulation and finalization of the triggers and prior actions.

27.     Decentralization of Task Team Management: The task team leaders of the two operations
and most of the team members were based in the field office and therefore were able to engage on
a continuous basis with government counterparts. This was a key factor for successful design
implementation of the program, particularly for the first operation given the urgency brought on
by the crisis.

28.      Supporting Analytical and TA Work: The selection of policy measures under the proposed
program results from a combination of analytical and institutional criteria. Key analytical inputs
in the preparation of the proposed program include the Vietnam Development Report 2009
(entitled Capital Matters - World Bank Report to the Vietnam Consultative Group Meeting,
December 2008). The long-standing analytical program of the World Bank and other donors was
used to select the actions deemed more strategic, or with the highest potential impact on the
actual implementation of public investment projects.


                                                17
29.      The analytical inputs from the World Bank and other donors combine insights from the
work program on public financial management and financial accountability, from the joint efforts
of the six development banks to implement the Paris Declaration and the Hanoi Core Statement
on Aid Effectiveness, from the flagship Vietnam Development Report series, and from the
technical assistance work in support of planning reform at MPI, among others. Within the time
frame of the program, the measures were extensively discussed with the relevant line ministries
and government agencies to identify which of them were feasible since April 2009.

30.     A series of core diagnostics and specific studies have been undertaken since 1999 to
provide sound analytical underpinnings to the implementation of the government-led public
financial management reform program. The two most important assessments produced in recent
years are the best-practice Public Expenditure Review and Integrated Fiduciary Assessment
(PER-IFA), completed in 2005, and the 2007 Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA) which was just been finalized. These two comprehensive diagnostics have helped
identify areas in need of further improvement, including the process of budget development,
budget execution control, accessibility of financial information, and accounting, reporting,
auditing and oversight framework. In the meantime, the recommendations from PER-IFA 2004
and CFAA 2007 have formed the basis for policy dialogue conducted in the program.

31.     Another important analytical underpinning for the design of the program was the
Diagnostic Framework for Assessing Public Investment Management, produced in August 20101
by the Public Sector and Governance Unit of the PREM anchor. This study provided a very
useful starting point to design the results framework, an area in which few precedents are
available. Other studies serving as analytical underpinnings for the proposed program included
the Public Investment Management Case Study for Vietnam conducted by the public sector group
in the PREM anchor (PRMPS), in collaboration with the country office in 2008, the 2006
Vietnam Infrastructure Strategy 2 , the analysis of land markets in the Business Vietnam
Development Report, and the piloting process for Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks
(MTEFs).

32.       Several of the actions pursued by the six development banks on-going dialogue with the
Government feed directly into the preparation of the program. On procurement, an independent
assessment of the Vietnamese system was commissioned by MPI in 2007 using the OECD-DAC
methodology. On the use of cost estimates as bid price ceilings, the program included a program
to review of the whole cost norm system to determine whether a reform would be advantageous
for Vietnam. On construction contracts, an Institutional Development Facility (IDF) grant
supports the Ministry of Construction (MOC) to review a critically important decree and prepare
for its replacement. Good progress was also made by the six development banks on the common
policy framework for resettlement and the environment. Regulations on SEAs and EIAs were
thoroughly reviewed, and proposals were made to improve the management of the resettlement of
illegal land users, which has been one of the most controversial issues in the public debate
recently. On streamlining payment procedures and removing non-essential disbursement checks,
the work of the six development banks included a survey of Project Management Units (PMUs)
practices, leading to consultation and discussion with key stakeholders (MOF, State Treasury, and
Vietnam Development Bank).

33.     The technical assistance provided to MPI by the Bank and several development partners
in recent years is aimed at introducing result-based planning and addressing remaining
weaknesses in investment management. Technical assistance has also been provided for the
preparation of legal framework for pilot PPP projects and for e-procurement. Some important
lessons have been derived from this technical assistance work. It appeared clearly that the key
impediment to further breakthroughs in planning reform has been the lack of a sound regulatory
framework that clearly spells out requirements, responsibilities processing, steps and resources
needed for strategic planning. Another important lesson concerns the lack of an effective M&E
mechanism which would not just be based on administrative reporting. At present, there are two
on-going IDF TFs aiming to support the revision of the Procurement Law, reviewing the
regulatory framework for public investment and strengthening MPI capacity in evidence-based
formulation of the legal documents.

34.      The World Bank‘s extensive analytical work on compensation and resettlement in
Vietnam are useful for forming the analytical framework of the program with regard to land issue.
A thematic group on the harmonization of resettlement policies has analyzed the main gaps
between government policies and international practice, and drawn an action plan to close the
gaps. A study conducted in 2008 provided an overview of current land policy-related research,
identifying key issues and suggesting areas for further work. Another study was done in the same
year on illegal land users, to serve as the basis for the policy dialogue with the government.
Another study on land conflict management addresses issues related to compensation and
resettlement3. It identifies constraints to effective land allocation and land use, and proposes
ways to provide incentives for private development, to improve performance in land
administration, and to preserve social equity.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

35.      As acknowledged in the Program Document of the two operations, designing an
appropriate results framework for the series was challenging, given the shortage of relevant
precedents to build upon, absence of adequate data on the quality of the public investment
portfolio and the fact that PFM reform does not lend itself to immediate measurable results.
Previous lending related to public investment management was quite limited and these operations
had a different scope than the PIR series and were either embedded in public financial
management reform or concerned a specific sector (such as roads, for instance) and therefore
their results frameworks did not particularly fit to the one for the program. Operations embedded
in public financial management reform typically rely on outcome indicators for the performance
of public investment management which are tied with measurement of efficiency, transparency
and accountability of the overall public financial management system. These indicators tend to
focus on strategic upstream public investment programming, on its alignment with budget
processes, and on enhancing the associated regulatory framework. But broad indicators of this
sort tend to be qualitative, and usually do not cover implementation and monitoring issues. On the
other hand, in operations with a sectoral focus, outcome indicators for public investment

management tend to emphasize project implementation. These programs are generally designed
with sufficient time frames to allow measuring the outcomes of investment spending.

36.      Another problem facing the task team in designing an M&E framework for the program
is the limited availability of data for assessing the overall efficiency of public investment. MPI
primarily relies on regular administrative reports from all provinces, line ministries and agencies,
as well as state economic groups and general corporations to compile the aggregate data for
investment. Quality of data from these reports is often questionable and there is no evaluation of
economic impact for public investment in general and for projects in particular. Apart from recent
efforts to formulate a set of pilot quantitative indicators for evaluation of ODA projects, MPI is
yet to develop guidelines with specific indicators for project management to replace Decree
12/2009 (guiding the implementation of the Construction Law). Different legal framework
applied to different sources and types of public investment (budget, off-budget, ODA, SOEs, etc.)
and the rapid decentralization in making investment decisions also compounds the data issues in
public investment management, imposing further difficulties for MPI in collecting reliable data.

37.       Collecting data for assessing the impact of the PIR program faces another problem in the
often very short time span between the issuance of legal documents as per the program policy
matrix and their actual effectiveness. In theory, a decree becomes effective two to three months
after its issuance. However, most of them will not be implemented in practice before the issuance
of the guiding documents, usually the circulars. It is not uncommon to have all the circulars
needed for the decree in question in place one year after the issuance of a decree. This is
particularly relevant for Prior Action 6 of PIR 2. This action was completed with the issuance of
Decree 29/2011 in the mid April 2011. But there is little information available about the actual
implementation of this Decree because it has to be followed by necessary implanting circulars.

38.     To overcome the weaknesses in M&E for public investment and data collection, the PIR
program included project oversight as one of the policy areas covered by the program, and there
are 2 policy actions in PIR1 and 1 policy action in PIR2. With the conclusion of the policy
actions, perhaps the important achievement of the program is to introduce, for the first time, a
common legal framework for the M&E of the public investment projects. The issued Decrees and
Circulars include sound guiding principles for M&E of projects and overall public investment.
Nevertheless, further reforms are needed to roll out these principles in practice, especially for
evaluation. Availability of adequate resources for independent evaluation is a commonly cited
problem that prevents the agencies from carrying out genuine independent evaluation.

39.     The monitoring framework (see Table 4) was proposed for the entire program (both PIR
1 and PIR 2) and had already been revised further in the PIR 1 Program Document. In particular,
Indicator 1 (number of FDI re-registered firms) was removed. With the issuance of Decree 102 on
October 1, 2010, the re-registration of FDI firms became unnecessary even if they want to have
operations in areas not specified in their license. As a result, the intended objective of removing
the constraints facing FDI firms to-be re-registered was achieved despite the proposed indicator
was no longer relevant.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

40.     Reform of the management of public investment and SOEs is a long-term process and the
Bank continues to place high priority of its support to Vietnam in this area. The CPS for the
period of 2012-2016 will support selected elements of the strategy for Vietnam‘s progress toward
a middle income country including transition from a focus on quantity toward a greater focus on
quality of production and service provisions; and from a comparative advantage of low-cost labor,

                                                20
with low value added, to one with a growing share of innovation-led and higher value-added
production and services. One of the three pillars of the CPS is strengthening Vietnam‘s
competitiveness in the regional and global economy. Among others, Pillar 1 on competitiveness
addresses Vietnam‘s vulnerability to macroeconomic instability which has structural roots in
distortions in the SOE and financial sectors and in weaknesses in public financial management.

41.      The post-PRSC Economic Management and Competitiveness Credit (EMCC)
programmatic series is expected to continue this reform agenda. The EMCC, which will be the
programmatic series of operations following the conclusion of the PRSC series, is expected to
focus and deepen the Bank‘s engagement on the economic growth agenda, in particular SOE
restructuring and public investment reform. EMCC addresses the need in three policy areas,
namely macroeconomic stability (maintaining fiscal discipline, and protecting vulnerable groups
from instability), a transparent, efficient, and accountable public sector (strengthening revenue
policy and administration, strengthening public expenditure management, improving public
investment management, and improving accountability and external oversight functions), and
enabling business environment (stabilizing banking sector, streamlining administrative
procedures for private businesses, and regulating state enterprises).

42.     Specific on-going TAs to support public investment reform includes two IDF TFs both
aim to strengthen the capacity of MPI. One of the two IDF TFs came into operation during the
preparation of the PIR program and helped the preparation of Circulars 13/2010 and 23/2010,
Prior Action 12 in PIR2. This IDF TF also assisted MPI in collaborating with research institutes
to review the legal framework for public investment and contributed inputs for the preparation of
the Law on Public Investment. The other IDF TF focuses on assisting MPI in the revision of the
Procurement Law, so as to narrow the gap between Vietnam‘s and international procurement
practices.

43.      In terms of AAA activities, the Bank already started a Programmatic Public Finance
Review (PPFR) for FY12-16 to complement ongoing work on public finance management (PFM).
The objectives of this programmatic AAA are to: (i) fill targeted analytical gaps to inform priority
PFM reforms; (ii) provide critical input on PFM policy issues to legislative and executive bodies;
(iii) provide analytical underpinning for PFM-related reforms in investment lending and
development policy operations. The PPFR will finance a core set of priority tasks, which will be
determined on an annual basis through discussion between GoV and the Bank. The upcoming
Financial Sector Development Strategy, the PEFA and DeMPA diagnostics, and ongoing donor
support for PFM reforms and analysis, helps inform activities in the coming years. For FY12, the
following three topics have been identified: Improving fiscal transparency, tax policy measures
for new sources of domestic revenue, and fiscal decentralization. In addition to specific topics
agreed on an annual basis, the PPFR team will conduct more regular fiscal analysis, notably: (i)
analysis of national budget, including macro setting, policy priorities, revenue analysis,
expenditure analysis, and budget financing; (ii) semi-annual fiscal note, including spending and
revenue execution, key trends, major virements, and any policy changes.

44.     In terms of lending, the Public Financial Management Reform Project for Vietnam has
provided support to strengthen the recipient's capacity to plan, execute and report on its budget
and to improve the transparency and accountability of the budgetary systems and processes. A
second extension of the closing date of this credit from February 28, 2011 to February 28, 2013
was approved, extending the project‘s life to nine years.

45.    The Second Power Sector Reform Development Policy Operation Program for Vietnam
began in 2012 with the objective to support the GoV in the design and implementation of a

                                                21
competitive market for electricity generation, restructuring of the power sector and reform of
electricity tariffs that aim to facilitate effective competition, transparency and predictability to
encourage generation investment, and to implement programs and incentives for efficient use of
electricity.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

46.      The PIR operation was prepared in the context of the global financial crisis and the need
for the Government of Vietnam to access $1.5 billion overseas development assistance on an
urgent basis. After considering various options, the Bank chose the PIR series as the most
appropriate instrument that would best achieve the delicate balance between the twin objectives
of short-term crisis response and feasible but meaningful actions to advance the overall
development agenda over the medium term. Inefficiencies in the public investment cycle were
identified, through analytical work, on-going dialogue between the government and the six
development banks, and consultations with sector colleagues implementing investment projects,
as a key constraint to infrastructure development and economic growth in Vietnam. The Bank
sought to take advantage of the increased focus of top-level policy-makers brought on by the
crisis to achieve progress in an area highly relevant to the medium term growth agenda and to
complement the on-going PRSC series, especially where limited progress was made.

47.      The objective of the PIR series was aligned with the Government‘s medium term
priorities and the CPS. The Government‘s SEDS 2011-20, the SEDP 2006-10, and the SEDP
2011-15 all identify improving public investment efficiency as a key priority. The Third Plenum
of the XI Central Party Committee in the end of 2011 instructed MPI to prepare a proposal for
restructuring the public investment management, including improvements in the regulatory
environment, more rigorous medium-term investment planning, increasing the efficiency of the
project cycle, and a more integrated framework for financing public investments through
alternative sources.

48.     In designing the programs to meet this objective, the Program Documents of the two
operations were candid in their assessment of the risks inherent in tackling a difficult area of
reform in the short-time frame necessary for crisis response, and in addressing longer term public
financial management and institutional reforms in the short time span of a development policy
operation. The choice of prior actions also reflected the team‘s attempt to be both pragmatic, with
several more procedural measures, particularly with regards to financial management, that could
be achieved relatively quickly in PIR 1, with more ambitious, and therefore, more risky, reform
measures, such as a new Law on Public Investments and reforming the governance arrangements
of SOEs. The program however refrained from going deeply into other important areas, such as
procurement reform, because of the difficulties in introducing fundamental changes where
substantive differences of views remained.

outcomes)

49.      The program has sufficient characteristics in its overall achievement to be rated
satisfactory. All but one policy actions were completed which made important contribution not
only to strengthening the overall management of public investment in Vietnam but also to
accelerating the reform momentum in this area. The Public Sector Board highlighted the program
as a good example of Bank‘s engagement in PIM reform in its briefing to the Bank‘s President.
The program not only provided timely support for the economic stimulus package but also was a
key policy instrument for the policy dialogue between the Bank, the IMF and the Government of
Vietnam in addressing issues of overheating during the course of PIR 2 implementation. However,
some weaknesses in designing the result framework and the slow progress of the formulation of
the Law on Public Investment lower the ICR‘s overall rating for the achievement of PDOs to
moderately satisfactory.

50.      The timely response of the Bank to the 2008/09 crisis was greatly appreciated by the
authorities. As was repeatedly voiced by key counterparts, the Bank‘s support in a time of need
underscored its role as the ―trusted partner‖ of the government and helped better position the
Bank to provide advice going forward on both public investment reform and SOE restructuring.
For example, the MOF established a high-level Working Group on SOE restructuring and has
requested the Bank for technical assistance. The MPI has requested Bank‘s assistance on its
proposal on investment restructuring legislation such as the preparation of the Law on Public
Investment and the Spatial Planning Law. Prior to the PIR series the Bank had little systemic
engagement on public investment management, despite the PRSCs and the dialogue between the
Government and six development banks on aid effectiveness, and it is expected that the Bank‘s
involvement will accelerate through analytical work, technical assistance, and the new
programmatic EMCC series.

51.     The overall performance of the Vietnamese economy in 2009-11 showed that the
immediate impetus for the program, namely crisis response, was very successful. Vietnam has
weathered the 2008-09 global economic crisis relatively well, in contrast to what was being
projected at the time. After declining to 5.3 percent in 2009, below the historic average of 7.5
percent, the economy grew by an estimated 6.8 percent in 2010 and 5.9 percent in 2011. The
rebound in export growth was particularly impressive and exceeded projections by a wide margin
— for example the IMF Article IV Staff Report of 2008 had projected that exports would increase
modestly from US$ 63 billion in 2008 to US$ 73 billion in 2011, whereas actual exports reached
US$ 96.9 billion in 2011. The timely and large stimulus package helped cushion the adverse
impact of the crisis.

52.      Assessment against the nine outcome indicators of the program shows that the targets for
six indicators were achieved by the time of the ICR mission. At present, target for one indicator is
not achieved and information for the remaining two indicators is not yet available for measuring
the impact of the program. One reason is that the actions were undertaken too recently and the
actual time period of effectiveness for the issued documents is too short for the realization of the
impact. Another reason is that the system needed for actual implementation is yet to be
established. The lack of information for assessment indicates some weaknesses of the result
framework for the program whose quality was apparently affected by the limited time devoted for
program design and the unavailability of relevant experience from precedent similar operations.

53.      In addition to assessing whether the prior actions achieved their stated objectives in terms
of improved outcomes as per the Results Framework, it is important to assess whether the PIR
program contributed to an overall increase in Government‘s commitment to public investment
reform in Vietnam. Beyond the specifics of the measures supported in the series, the most
significant achievement of the programmatic series was the recognition by the government on the
importance of improving public investment management, and the improved dialogue between the
Bank, and other development partners, and the government on this agenda. Improving public
investment efficiency and SOE restructuring are two of three priority areas in the 2011-2015
SEDP, and the Government has taken numerous steps recently, as detailed in Box 1, towards this
objective. Moreover, the implementation of the PIR program helped the Government of Vietnam
strengthen the coordination among its ministries and agencies in conducting macroeconomic
policies. Cooperation between MOF and SBV was facilitated during the preparation of the
stabilization package with active participation of the IMF and the Bank in the context of
negotiation of PIR2. In February 2012, MOF and SBV officially formalized a mechanism for
their cooperation by signing an agreement of collaboration and information exchanges which
marks an important milestone in inter-ministerial coordination in macroeconomic management.

54.     There are also other indicators which show notable improvements in the management of
public investment in Vietnam during the period 2009-2011. Budget deficit fell significantly from
7.2 percent of GDP in 2009 to just 2.7 percent in 2011, largely due to the consolidation in public
investment. Total capital spending (including off-budget) also declined considerably from 16.3
percent of GDP to 9.4 percent over the same period. This illustrated the intention of the
Government of Vietnam to continue fiscal consolidation efforts by targeting more efficient public
investment.

55.     While the withdrawal of the stimulus once growth resumed was delayed, and resulted in
growing macroeconomic vulnerabilities, the Government moved decisively in early 2011 by
issuing Resolution 11 which called for a wide range of monetary, fiscal, and structural policy
reforms to address excess demand. The delay of PIR 2 because of macroeconomic concerns
helped raise the necessary alarm bells and contributed to this important policy measure. In sum

                                                       24
therefore, from the macroeconomic perspective, the two operations helped in both supporting the
fiscal stimulus when it was needed in 2009 and in its withdrawal to avoid further overheating of
the economy.

 Box 1: Government of Vietnam’s recent steps to improve public investment efficiency

 Socio-Economic Development Plan (2011-15) and Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2011-
 2020): The main goal of the SEDP and SEDS is to improve productivity and competitiveness of the
 Vietnamese economy by restructuring the economy and changing the growth model, placing greater
 emphasis on efficiency and value addition. These strategic documents identified restructuring of the
 SOEs and public investment as two of three restructuring pillars. The MPI has been assigned by the
 government to prepare a plan for restructuring the economy and changing growth model. The draft plan
 was submitted to the National Assembly in May 2012 for review.

 Directive 1792/CT-TTG (October 15, 2011) by the Prime Minister on Enhancing Management of
 Investment from State Budget and Government Bonds: Directive 1792 deals with inflated demand for
 public resources by investment projects by emphasizing the consideration of the overall availability of
 resources in project appraisal. The oversight role of the central government will be strengthened by the
 participation of MOF and MPI in appraising the overall resource availability for provinces, line
 ministries and agencies. For the first time, individual responsibilities in investment decision making
 was clearly spelled out. Directive 1792 also requires moving from an annual investment planning cycle
 to medium-term planning and assigns MPI to prepare a Decree on Medium-term Investment Planning.
 The plan is to issue the Decree in the third quarter of 2012.

 Preparation of Plan for Restructuring the SOEs and Plan for Restructuring Public Investment: MOF
 and MPI have been assigned by the Government to take the lead in preparing the plan for restructuring
 the SOEs and restructuring public investment, respectively. Draft plans have recently been presented to
 the Cabinet. The reform of the SOE sector places great emphasis on the State Economic Groups and
 General Corporations. Several measures are listed, including acceleration of equitization process,
 improved separation between state ownership exercising and state regulatory functions, imposing
 market disciplines to the SOEs, and strengthening corporate governance. The proposed plan for
 restructuring public investment focuses on further improving the legal framework, enhanced oversight
 of central government and gradual reduction of public investment together with the facilitation of the
 participation of private sector in infrastructure investment. The promulgation of a law governing public
 investment management and a law for spatial planning has been identified as a major task during the
 next two years.




56.     Moving to the specifics of the PIR program, while all the prior actions were fulfilled,
with one notable exception, progress in implementation and follow-on measures to achieve the
outcomes against each of the policy areas was mixed. These are discussed in more details below,
with progress against individual outcome indicators provided in Annex 5.

Project Selection: Moderately unsatisfactory

57.     Prior analytical work and on-going dialogue between the 6 Development Banks and the
Government had identified numerous weaknesses in the planning, selection, and financing of
public investment projects. Underpinning these problems was a weak regulatory framework with
many fragmented and often conflicting laws and decrees (for example there are different sets of
regulations for projects with and without construction works). Project planning was weak and
fragmented because of lack of environmental screening, lack of inter-sectoral or inter-provincial


                                                   25
prioritization, and limited use of socio-economic cost benefit analysis in the selection of projects.
In particular, in the context of the significant decentralization of public investment decision-
making to line ministries and provinces brought on by the Law of Investments (2006), MPI‘s
authority to appraise and screen investment projects had greatly dwindled and had not been
replaced by any alternative institutional mechanisms.

58.      To improve project selection, the PIR program focused on the preparation of a new Law
on Public Investments to establish a clear and consistent regulatory framework for project
preparation, appraisal, implementation, and monitoring in the context of decentralization.
However, lack of consensus on this law within the Cabinet resulted in delays and the trigger was
consequently dropped from PIR 2. With the growing attention on the potential adverse impact of
fiscal policy in general and public investment in particular on the recurrent overheating of the
economy, a consensus on this law has seemingly reached and the Government has asked the MPI
to prepare this law for the National Assembly in 2012 for review and in 2013 for approval. The
initial proposal of the National Assembly is to merge the Law on Public Investment with the
revised Law on Procurement into a new law entitled the Law on Public Investment and Public
Procurement. But the recent development indicated an inclination to having two separate laws
instead of an encompassing one.

59.     This dropped prior action was a focal point of discussion during the Bank‘s Operations
Committee (OC) meeting on PIR 2 with guidance given to the team to continue support for the
Law through other channels such as on-going trust fund support and analytical work. The size of
PIR 2 was reduced from US$ 500 million to US$ 350 million in part due to this missed action
(the other reasons being the IBRD exposure limit and the smaller Government financing gap
following the economic recovery).

60.      A second measure was improved planning through the integration of Strategic
Environmental Assessments (SEAs) in regional and sectoral master plans. The main problem
being addressed by the prior actions was the poor quality of the SEAs for master plans caused by
the late preparation of SEAs, done almost as an afterthought in the preparation of master plans,
and inadequate funding for their preparation. Lack of effective SEAs has commonly been
identified as one of the main reasons undermining the environmental sustainability of investment
in general and public investment in particular.

61.      To date the SEAs of the master plans of all six regions and the power sector have been
appraised and the corresponding draft master plans have incorporated recommendations from the
SEAs, thus going beyond the program target of four regions and one sector (Outcome Indicator 1).
However, the authorities commented that the initial drafts of some of the regional SEAs were of
inadequate quality and therefore did not have the requisite ―demonstration effect‖ that was the
objective of the reform. The preparation of these drafts broadly followed the instruction as given
in Circular 05/2008 but they are often vague when it comes to the assessment of proposed
alternatives of the master plans and there were no description of specific measures for mitigation
of potential negative impacts or for environmental monitoring and management during the
implementation of the master plans. SEAs reports with technical support from development
partners (two regions and the power sector) are better appreciated by the authorities. The quality
differentials of the SEAs can largely be attributed to the lack of clarity in terms of technical
guidelines on their preparation and the problem of inadequate funding. It was expected that these
issues were to be addressed by the implementation of Prior Action 6 of PIR 2 (under area for
project implementation).



                                                 26
62.      Despite an overall rating of ―moderately unsatisfactory‖ for this program pillar based on
the limited progress on outcomes, credit should be given to the team for taking on a difficult, but
necessary, measure in the Law on Public Investment; it is unlikely that in the current context, a
less ambitious measure would have achieved the objective of strengthening the regulatory
framework for public investment management. In addition, the Bank country team has continued
the policy dialogue and technical assistance with regards to reform of public investment
regulations as committed in the OC meeting. There is an on-going IDF TF that aims to
strengthen MPI capacity in preparing legal documents. A component of this IDF TF is devoted to
reviewing the existing regulatory framework for public investment and arranging consultations to
obtain inputs for the formulation of the Law on Public Investment. Another IDF TF, approved in
2011, provides assistance to MPI in the revision work of the Procurement Law. The VDR 2012
devotes a large section to on examine the performance of SOEs and public investment and makes
several recommendations for further reforms. Together with the Office of the Government, the
Bank in February 2012 arranged a high level workshop to discuss technical issues and policy
options for restructuring the SOEs.

Project Implementation: Moderately satisfactory

63.     Public procurement reform has been a difficult area of dialogue as there is a fundamental
disagreement between the Government and development partners on the principles of public
procurement. An assessment of Vietnam‘s public procurement law and related regulations using
the OECD/DAC criteria revealed significant weaknesses in 14 of 17 dimensions, including the
over-reliance on direct contracting (amounting to almost 50 percent of total state budget
procurement by value in 2009), routine contract negotiations for goods and works, use of re-
bidding, and problems with contract evaluation.

64.      Given this overarching constraint, the program focused on the modest goal of enhancing
bidding transparency through the piloting of e-government in 3 large agencies, namely Hanoi
People‘s Committee, EVN, and VNPT, thereby achieving the program outcome (Outcome
Indicator 2). While the number of the pilot institutions was small, together they cover a relatively
large number of transactions with generally positive results and the government aims to expand e-
procurement to 7 additional agencies in 2012. The draft new Law on Public Investment and
Public Procurement also has a chapter on e-procurement, indicating the government‘s continued
attention on this agenda.

65.      A prior action for the second operation touches upon the transfer of the representation of
state ownership rights in SOEs out of the line ministries and focusing on the general corporations
which were under MOC management. On January 12, 2010, the Prime Minister issued Decisions
52 and 54/QD-TTg on the establishment of two State Economic Groups by restructuring ten
existing general corporations and one independent SOE which used to belong to MOC. The
Prime Minister issued two additional Decisions in February 2010 (Decisions 261 and 262),
appointing the Board members of these two groups. The exercise of ownership rights has been
transferred out of MOC to the Boards of these two economic groups, thus fulfilling the program
outcome (Outcome Indicator 3). This change helps remove the eligibility issues related to
potential conflict of interest that used to prevent the state enterprises under MOC management
from participating in the bidding for construction work owned by MOC.

66.      The momentum of SOE reform continues strongly in MOC. An equitization framework
for the remaining general corporations with 100 per cent state equity under the Vietnam Industrial
Construction Group and Housing and Urban Development was approved by the Prime Minister in
December 2010. The equitization of these general corporations is expected to be completed in

                                                27
2012. At present, there are only four General Corporations under MOC management. Apart from
the four mother companies and four children companies which remain 100 percent owned by the
state, all other children companies of these four MOC general corporations have already been
equitized. Restructuring plans of these four general corporations were approved by the Prime
Minister in March 2012 with Official Letter 283/Ttg-DMDN issued on March 5, 2012. According
to the plans, all mother companies of the remaining four MOC‘s general corporations will be
equitized by 2015 (i.e. Construction Corporation No.1, Building Materials Corporation No. 1,
Vietnam Urban and Industrial Zone Development Investment Corporation, and Vietnam National
Construction Consultants Corporation) and the State will hold more than 50 percent of equity.
The share of state equity in these companies will decline gradually and the target is that the state
does not have the dominant share by 2020.

67.     Many aspects of civil work contracts including content, time requirements, adjustment of
costs, guarantees, insurance and legal obligations of engaged parties were not clearly defined in
the regulatory framework and this problem was aggravated during the post 2006 construction
boom. A prior action of the PIR 2 aims to address these issues and the issuance of Decree 48 in
2010 about contracts in civil work with more than 30 percent capital from the state budget
represents an important progress. In addition, MOC has also instituted a number of specific
templates for different types of contracts in civil work. These changes are expected to facilitate
the implementation of the contracts in civil work.

68.      Land reclamation and compensation are affected by inconsistencies between the various
regulations governing land and real estate. Land is not always valued at market prices, support for
loss of livelihoods is not provided and illegal land users are discriminated against. Under PIR 1
Decree 69/2009/ND-CP was approved by MONRE requiring agricultural land acquisition to be
based on market prices and compensation to include relocation and resettlement support, and
livelihood and production support. There are only negligible differences between Decree 69 and
the Bank regulations for compensation of agricultural land for titled owners. Anecdotal evidence,
for example from the experience of Bank-funded projects, suggests that Decree 69 is being
implemented and satisfaction of displaced people has greatly improved. There is a need for
systematic survey to provide stronger evidence for achievements related to this outcome indicator.

69.      The policy actions under this area also aimed to address the issue of poor quality of
Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs). The EIAs are often conducted at a late phase in
project preparation, hence have limited impact on the decision on whether or not to approve a
project, thereby violating the requirements of the Law on Environmental Protection. Two prior
actions under PIR 2 sought to address this issue through the issuance of Decree 29/2011 on the
timely preparation of EIAs and greater clarity on the need for consultations with the affected
population, and the issuance of circulars to introduce some costs norms for the preparation of
EIAs.

70.      At the ICR preparation stage, the outcomes from these measures are mixed. On the one
hand, the revision of regulation related to EIA preparation has contributed to raising the resources
for EIA significantly, more than the target of 0.5 percent as per assessment of MONRE officials.
With the issuance of Circular 50 which became effective in May 2012 and set the formula for
allocating the budget for EIAs, there will be further improvement and hence this target is
considered to be achieved. On the other hand, Outcome Indicator 5 (on timing of EIA) remains to
be realized. While Decree 29 was a positive step and contains significant changes such as moving
the EIA appraisal authority out of the PMUs, actual implementation, in particular community
consultations, will require time and further technical guidelines to elaborate its provisions. In
addition, Decree 29 only came into effect since June 2011 and Circular 26 guiding the

                                                28
implementation of Decree 29 came into effect from September 2011. There is a very short time
period for actual implementation; hence measuring progress against Outcome Indicator 5 is
practically impossible at the time of the ICR mission.

Financial Management: Moderately satisfactory

71.     Inadequate cost estimates have been a major factor contributing to poor public investment
planning that results in downstream delays in project implementation. The program sought to
address this problem by requiring cost norms for administrative items to be aligned to the market
and to be regularly updated. As per the prior actions under the program the MOF issued Circulars
01/2010 and 97/2010 related to better align some cost norms including norms for travel costs and
workshop arrangements with market prices. More flexibility has been introduced with increased
autonomy for spending units in setting the specific norms up to 20 percent higher than the MOF
norms. Nevertheless, these norms in the wake of on-going high inflation can quickly become
outdated, given that there was no provision for automatic adjustment. Therefore, the underlying
problem of the inflexibility of these cost norms has not been addressed.

72.      The other actions on financial management focused on the recording and audits of
revenues and expenditures from ODA funds. Here the prior actions have resulted in improved
timeliness of recording which is now being done on a quarterly basis together with state budget
revenue and expenditure (thereby meeting Outcome Indicator 6). In meetings with government
officials, it was confirmed that there has been a good compliance in sharing the audit reports with
the SAV.

73.      Private financing for infrastructure will play an increasingly important role in Vietnam
but is currently underutilized due to weaknesses in the regulatory framework for Public Private
Partnerships (PPPs), in particular on how to handle unsolicited PPP proposals and on a clear and
transparent mechanism for government guarantees to address the viability gap in PPP projects.
The prior action for PIR 2, Decision 71 of the Prime Minister issued on November 9, 2010, sets
up for the first time interim regulations for pilot PPP projects with the objective that the
experience of the pilot during a period of 3-5 years would be used to prepare more comprehensive
legal provisions. To date, nearly 30 projects proposals had been submitted by technical ministries
and provincial people committees to MPI for pilot projects and MPI has to coordinate the
selection of pilot projects to be approved by the Prime Minister. However, progress on the actual
implementation of a pilot project has been limited. Currently one road project has been selected
as a pilot, but this is an unsolicited proposal that may not be suitable for achieving the objectives
of demonstrating a transparent Viability Gap Financing Mechanism. The Government is
planning to establish a Project Development Facility (PDF) with the financial and technical
assistances from donors to facilitate the preparation of a series of viable and bankable PPP pilot
projects.

Project Oversight: Moderately satisfactory

74.     MPI has a key role in monitoring and evaluation given the significant decentralization of
authority for project preparation and implementation to line ministries and provinces. The
fragmentation in the legal framework meant that there was no clear M&E framework for public
investment projects. In addition to procedural improvements through broadening the use of
standardized reporting tool for all public investment projects regardless of financing sources, the
program sought to introduce independent evaluation of the outcomes of completed projects. As
per the prior action, the Government issued Decree 113 and several circulars on arrangements for


                                                 29
monitoring and evaluation that included provisions for the use of independent evaluators, and
followed up with a circular specifying the details of the certification process for these evaluators.

75.      However, to date there has been limited progress in the use of independent evaluators for
public investment projects. The original PIR 2 trigger of a charter establishing an Association of
Independent Evaluators proved to be too difficult, and was replaced with the prior action of the
legal requirements for individuals and organizations to be certified to perform evaluation. MPI
has already issued Circulars 13 and 23 in 2010 which outline the procedures for training institutes
to register with MPI and for certification of individuals and organizations engaging in investment
evaluation. There remains, however, a problem with insufficient funding for project evaluation.
As per the regulations, funding for project evaluation has to come from the budget of the
concerned project — there is no separate state budget provision for evaluation. To date, no large
project has been reviewed by independent evaluators, thus missing the target of 7 percent set in
the program (Outcome Indicator 9). But this target appears to be over-ambiguous if taking into
account the time needed for setting up the training institutions with relevant curriculum, training
and certification of independent evaluators as well as the changes needed in the budgeting process
for making resources available for independent evaluation.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

76.      The overall rating of moderately satisfactory is based on weighing (a) the program‘s
contribution to the stimulus package which was successful in helping the Vietnamese economy
avoid a deeper recession; (b) PIR 2‘s contribution to the necessary macro-economic tightening in
2011; (c) the program‘s contribution to the Government‘s clear commitment to prioritizing public
investment reform and the elevation of the Bank‘s engagement as the ―trusted partner‖; and (d)
the less than satisfactory achievement of specific outcomes in the some areas related to project
screening, environmental management, financial management, and monitoring and evaluation
discussed above. Given the medium-to-long-term nature of institutional and financial
management reforms, success will depend on both the Government‘s continued commitment and
the Bank‘s continued focus on this agenda in the next CPS.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

77.     The budget support program was prepared at the request of GOV which needed urgently
resources for a sizeable stimulus package The package was effective in contribution to sustaining
business confidence, economic activity and economic growth momentum. Vietnam had managed
to navigate through the crisis period 2008-09 relatively well. The economy grew at 6.8 percent in
2010 and the crisis seemed to have little impact on the pace of poverty reduction and employment.

78.      In the context of PIR program, the formulation and implementation of Resolution 11 has
played a major role behind the slowing down of inflation and gradually restores macroeconomic
stability. Resolution 11 also pays great attention to social measures and that has helped to
mitigate the potential adverse impacts of tightening policies. It is reported that despite slowing
down in GDP growth in 2011, employment generation and poverty reduction continued to record
positive results. About 1.6 million new jobs were created in 2011 and the unemployment rate of

                                                 30
people in working age living in urban areas was maintained at 3.9–4 percent. The poverty
incidence in 2011 decreased by 2 percentage points and the number of poor district decreased by
4 percent. Significant resources have been prioritized to implementing poverty reduction
measures in 62 poor districts, including the especially disadvantaged communes and villages, and
the national target program on sustainable poverty reduction for period 2011-2015.

 (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

79.      Apart from the issuance of various legal documents, the implementation of PIR program
has reinforced the well-known need for improved coordination among government agencies in
policy formulation and implementation. Perhaps a positive (but unexpected) institutional
development impact was the signing of an agreement between SBV and MOF in coordinating
their activities and information exchange with regards to macroeconomic management.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

80.      Another unintended impact of the PIR programmatic operations is its contribution to
raising the awareness of public investment reforms in Vietnam, not only for MPI but also for the
other line ministries. The implementation of PIR program provided good entry points for further
policy dialogues for a range of issues including land management, environmental protection in
planning, SOE reform and planning reform.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Low

81.     The risk of reform reversal is rated low given that the political consensus at the highest
level was reached on further bold reform measures for both SOEs and public investment. In
November 2011, the Prime Minister issued Directive 1792 which aims to accelerate the reform in
public investment management by strengthening the oversight of MPI and MOF in screening
public projects and imposing individual responsibility in making investment decisions.
Restructuring public investment and restructuring SOEs are two of the three restructuring pillars
of the SEDP 2011-15 and the SEDS 2011-20. This clearly indicates that high priority has been
given to further reform of public investment during the next ten years.

82.     Recent proposal on public investment and SOEs restructuring developed by MPI and
MOF include follow-up measures of reforms undertaken in the context of PIR, such as facilitating
PPP development, strengthening the separation of state ownership exercising and state
management functions, and revising of the Law on Environmental Protection. Both the newly
introduced measures and the proposed reforms in the draft restructuring plans suggest that none
of the changes introduced by the PIR program will be reversed or diluted. The significant decline
of the share of public investment in total investment and in GDP in the last few years provides
further evidence on the determination of the Government of Vietnam to continue fiscal
consolidation by more efficient public investment.


                                                31
83.      The decision to include the Law on Public Investment and the revised Procurement Law
in the 2012 legislative agenda of the National Assembly tenure 13th provides additional proof of
the consensus reached for bold measures in difficult reform areas. Drafts of both laws will be
submitted to the National Assembly at the end of 2012 for review. In addition, a Spatial Planning
Law is being developed, also for the 2013 legislative agenda and aims at improving the inter-
provincial coordination in investment planning. Decision has also been made about moving from
annual to medium-term investment planning in order to reduce the fragmentation associated with
the mismatch between short-term planning cycle and the longer-term nature of investment
projects. A Decree for this change has been prepared by the MPI and is expected to be issued by
the third quarter of 2012.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

(a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

84.      Through the PRSC series, the Bank, together with other development partners, has
established a long and successful history of working closely with the Government on
development policy operations to identify reforms and follow up their progress. Quality at entry
for the PIR series was therefore ensured by this on-going engagement as well as the strong
program of support outside of the operation to help facilitate technical assistance and guidance in
the selection and execution of triggers [see Box 2]. As a result, all but one (trigger on Public
Investment Law) triggers subsequently became prior actions with little modifications as normally
the case for programmatic DPLs, despite the inclusion of a large number of triggers in the two
PIR operations. This demonstrated the strategic relevance, government commitment, and the buy-
in by the senior leadership as well as officials at technical levels. Moreover, throughout the
annual preparation process of the two operations, the Bank was able to meet a tight delivery
schedule, especially considering the depth of the engagement involving a cross-section of
numerous government agencies and personnel.

85.    The two operations were also prepared in close collaboration with the six development
banks, and AFD provided co-financing based on the same policy matrix. This provided a
harmonized approach to policy-based lending and reduced the government‘s transaction costs in
working with its counterparts.

86.     The Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is assessed as moderately satisfactory,
taking into account some weaknesses in the design of the result framework which did not
anticipate fully sufficient time needed for the realization of some targets. The rating also reflects
some weaknesses in the identification of the policy actions which resulted in the droppage of one
trigger and delay in the completion of two other policy actions. This delay has lead to the
temporary four-week suspension of the PIR2 negotiation.

      Box 2: On-going and Planned World Bank TA and AAA Activities on Public Investments

  1. Public Financial Management Reform Project (additional financing, 2011 -2013): The objective of
  the Public Financial Management Reform Project (PFMRP) for Vietnam is to strengthen the
  recipient's capacity to plan, execute and report on its budget and to improve the transparency and
  accountability of the budgetary systems and processes. PFMRP has three main components in addition
  to a project management component: implementation of an integrated Treasury and Budget
  Management Information System (TABMIS); strengthening of state budget and investment planning;
  and strengthening of the Government's ability to manage Vietnam's public debt and to begin
  monitoring fiscal risks that emanate from SOE liabilities. As part of the restructuring, a second two-
  year extension of closing date of the original credit from February 28, 2011 to February 28, 2013 was
  approved, extending the project life to nine years.

  2. Project Preparation Technical Assistance Facility Project (2010-2015): The objective is to increase
  the capacity of Government entities to plan and prepare public investments efficiently up to
  international quality standards. The project has three components: project preparation facility; project
  preparation facility support and capacity building; and incremental operating costs and project
  management expenses.

  3. Financial Sector Modernization and Information Management System Project (2008-2014): The
  objectives are to assist the SBV, the Credit Information Center (CIC), and the Deposit Insurance of
  Vietnam (DIV) to improve the delivery of their main functions in accordance with relevant
  international standards for the banking sector, through: (a) developing a centralized and integrated
  system of advanced business processes and a modern information technology architecture; and (b)
  strengthening their institutional capacity in carrying out their operations. The project has three
  components: functional strengthening and business re-engineering; Information and Communications
  Technology (ICT) platform development; and project implementation management.

  4. Land Administration Project (2008-2013): The objectives are to increase access to land information
  services by all stakeholders through development of an improved land administration system in
  selected provinces in Vietnam. The project has three components: modernization of the land
  registration system; improvement of land registration service delivery; and support for the overall
  implementation of the project through project management monitoring and evaluation.

  5. Vietnam Tax Administration Modernization Project, TAMP (2007-2013): The objectives are to
  assist the General Department of Taxation (GDT) in strengthening governance in tax administration
  and to increase the level of voluntary compliance with the tax system by improving the effectiveness,
  efficiency, transparency and accountability of the tax administration. The project has four
  components: institutional development for the tax administration; operational modernization of the tax
  administration functions and processes; IT development; and project management.




(b)     Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements)

Rating: Satisfactory

87.     As the prior actions were completed before the loan went to the board, supervision was
technically not needed. Instead, in preparation for the next loan, continuing dialogue with the
government and follow-up on the status of triggers served as a de facto form of supervision.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance


                                                    33
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

88.     The overall Bank performance is rated as moderately satisfactory, reflecting the above
rating on the achieved outcomes, the quality of the program design and quality of supervision.
The task team made a strong effort to prepare and supervise a program in a challenging
environment with uncertainty in global environment and recurrent macro instability in Vietnam.
Such effort ultimately allowed the program to deliver on most of its intended development
objectives, but moderate shortcomings in delayed implementations of one key policy action
affected the overall performance efficiency.

Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

89.     Government performance is assessed as moderately satisfactory. While the cooperation
of the related line ministries and agencies was very good, the rating reflects the delay in the
preparation of two policy actions that resulted in a temporary four-week suspension of the
negotiation. A further shortcoming is the droppage of the submission of the Law of Public
Investment as a prior action.

(b)     Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
 Rating: Satisfactory

90.      The performance of the coordinating agency, the SBV is rated as satisfactory. This
reflects the considerable efforts exerted by the SBV in successful coordinating the complex
program over a short period of time.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91.      The overall performance of the Borrower is assessed as moderately satisfactory,
reflecting the assessment of achievements of the development outcomes of the operation earlier
and the ratings in paragraphs 82 and 83.

6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)

92.      An important lesson learned is that it is difficult to achieve significant institutional
strengthening in the short time frame of a development policy operation prepared for crisis
response. The Bank‘s decision to design the crisis response as a thematic DPL focusing on a high
priority reform area was correct and paid off in terms of garnering the attention of top policy
makers on this issue. There is plenty of evidence, as detailed earlier, about the Government‘s
commitment on making progress on reforming the public investment system and restructuring the
SOE sector.

93.     The Bank will need to work effectively with a range of stakeholders, especially in the
public investment area, given the decentralization of decision-making authority on public
investments and the challenge to MPI in leading the reform process in this decentralized
environment. It was not feasible for the Bank to engage more deeply with the other key
stakeholders, in particular the provinces, in the limited time frame of the PIR series, but this
engagement will be necessary going forward with the successor EMCC operation.


                                               34
94.     The experience of PIR 2 also shows that holding the line and delaying the operation was
the correct decision in order to force the issue on macroeconomic stability, as well as reducing the
amount of the operation on account of the missed action on the Law on Public Investments. This
decision was appreciated by key counterparts.

95.      For smooth implementation of DPLs, consideration of potential time needed for the
completion of triggers must take into account the following factors: (i) Borrower‘s procedures for
issuing legal documents and (ii) potential coordination issues among Borrower‘s agencies. The
two programmatic operations had a number of triggers that dealt with issuance or preparation of
legal documents that required a considerable amount of time for the government to complete the
internal procedures not only within the Cabinet but also requires the interaction with the National
Assembly. As a result, the completion of some policy actions was delayed and a key trigger was
missed.

Annex 7: Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Government of Vietnam highly appreciates the support from the World Bank through the two
PIR operations. These operations brought about notable positive results, and helped the
Government meet its planned objectives. Specific impacts of the PIR program include the
following:

Financing: The PIR program is a development policy loan operation so all of the money
(US$850 million dollars funded by the Bank and €135 million funded by Government of Japan)
was merged to the State budget and managed by the Vietnamese Government following its public
investment process and procedure. Thanks to the programs, the Government used the loans
effectively in resolving financial difficulties. Especially, the PIR1 loan was provided to Vietnam
in the midst of the global financial crisis which had severe consequences on Vietnam. The
program provided timely financial support to the Government and the available resources
contributed to Vietnam‘s successful implementation of the economic stimulus packages to
overcome the global economic crisis in 2009.

Reform program: The program was designed with 22 policy actions in the area of public
investment management, related to eight line ministries and agencies, aiming to support the
government in further improvement of quality and efficiency of public investment. The
implementation of the policy actions have contributed to the revision of the regulatory framework
for public investment management, leading to higher efficiency in using public resources and
accelerating the implementation of public projects in Vietnam in general and ODA projects of
development partners in particular, including World Bank funded projects. The contribution to
increase in efficiency of resource usage helps the government of Vietnam achieve better
development objectives in poverty reduction and economic development. The implementation of
the program relied on a collaborative process, that not only emphasized the ownership of Vietnam
in the design, formulate and implement the reform program but also strengthened the partnership
between the Government of Vietnam and development partners.

Coordination with other development partners: PIR program was a budget support operation
initiated by the World Bank. The Agence Française de Développement had joined the program as
a co-financier. The preparation and implementation of the program benefitted significantly from
constructive, cooperative and effective dialogues between all parties on a flexible basis as needed.
As a result, the program was sucessfully implemented within a very short time span, meeting the
objectives and the needs of the Government of Vietnam in a timely manner. In particular, the task
team of the World Bank was very proactive in coordination with the SBV team and related line
ministries and agencies in making relevant amendments for the policy matrix, making it in line
with on-going reform agenda of the government. This had lead to a highly relevant policy matrix
and brought about positive program impacts.

Annex 8: Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders


The Agence Française de Développement (AFD) has joined the six development banks group
(ADB, AFD, JICA, KfW, Kexim and WB) since 2003. The group focuses on the dialogue with
the Government in order to improve concrete projects‘ procedures during projects‘ cycle, in the
spirit of improving aid effectiveness and harmonization of procedures.

In 2009, the World Bank initiated the PIR operation, in response to an official request of the
Government, and invited members of the six development banks group to co-finance the
operation. AFD appreciated the initiative and had been closely working with the task team of the
Bank for the preparation of the PIR1 and PIR2 operations, as well as the evaluation of the
program at completion. AFD has brought its specific contributions on the actions relating
financial management and PPP.

AFD co-financed the program by two budget support credits, the first one of 100 million EUR
approved on January 21, 2010 and disbursed on April 1st, 2010 and the second of 35 milllion
EUR approved on May 25, 2011 and disbursed on December 22, 2011.

AFD strongly appreciates the professionalism of the Bank task team in the dialogue with different
Government stakeholders on various and complex issues covering public investment reform
agenda, especially during the preparation of the Resolution 11. The team had to deal with
different topics during each series of technical meetings in a quite short period of time.

The program received strong contribution and support of the Government. The SBV played its
strong coordination role for the program. While most ministries were strongly involved in the
dialogue process at the highest level with participation of ministerial leaders, some ministries did
not pay sufficient attention and efforts in achieving the targets.

Although some outcome indicators of the program could not be measured due to the short time
period since the effectiveness of the issued legal documents, AFD is convinced that the PIR
operations has strongly contributed to the public investment reform agenda in Vietnam, one of the
key reform pillars that Government is continuing to pursue.

In conclusion, AFD assesses PIR as a satisfactory operation. AFD appreciates this opportunity to
co-finance with the Bank and hopes to continue the cooperation with the Bank in future
operations.
