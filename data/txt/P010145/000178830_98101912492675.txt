SRI LANKA
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
THE SECOND SRI LANKA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
I. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
National Sector Organization and Development
1.01      The Ministry of Local Government, Housing and Construction (MLG) has
primary responsibility for development of water supply and sewerage facilities
throughout Sri Lanka. The Ministry executes its responsibilities through the
principal executing agency in the sector, the National Water Supply and Drain-
age Board (WDB) and through Local Authorities. Other ministries which are
connected with water supply and sanitation are the Ministry of Irrigation,
Power and Highways, and the Ministry of Health. The Ministries of Finance
and Planning, and of Plan Implementation are concerned with the allocation
of funds for sector development and the Ministry of Plantation Industries is
responsible for water supply and sanitation within its estates.
1.02      Since its formation in 1975, from the Department of Water Supply
and Drainage, WDB has been responsible for planning, design and construction
of water supply systems throughout Sri Lanka, although its activities have
been largely confined to water supplies in urban and the larger rural communi-
ties. In order to extend WDB's activities to rural areas, a hydrogeological
section has recently been formed to drill wells for villages located in hard-
rock areas.
1.03      WDB assists local authorities in planning and constructing water
supply systems and frequently retains responsibility for operating the head-
works of such systems. Most local authorities operate and maintain their own
distribution systems and collect revenue, although in some cases this function
has remained with, or has been transferred to WDB. In the Greater Colombo
area, the water sources, transmission and treatment systems are operated by
WDB, and water is supplied in bulk to Colombo Municipality and to five adjacent
Municipalities located to the south of Colombo.  WDB is in the process of
assuming responsibility from Colombo Municipal Council, for the operation
of the Colombo sewerage system, and will also assume responsibility for
operation of the Colombo water distribution system in the near future.
1.04      Of the 1971 Sri Lanka census 1/ population of 12.7 million, 22%
were urban and 78% rural. Some 42% of the urban population received piped
water through house connections and a further 29% used public taps. The urban
population was located in 135 communities, 66 of which had piped water and the
remaining 69 relied on wells and surface water sources of doubtful quality and
poor yield. Only 3 of the piped water systems provided water on a 24-hour
basis, and the quality of water supplied was not always satisfactory. Of the
4 towns outside the project area with populations exceeding 50,000 (Kandy,
Galle, Jaffna and Trincomalee) only Kandy and Galle had a 24-hour piped water
1/   The 1971 housing census provides the only relatively reliable and
consistent data.

service. In rural areas only 1% had house connections, 12% used public taps,
and the remainder drew water from surface water sources or wells.
1.05      Regarding waste disposal, only Colombo has waterborne sewerage
which currently serves only about 50% of its housing units. Of the total
1971 urban population of Sri Lanka, some 23% had flush toilets, 57% had
some other form of latrine, and 20% had no service. In rural areas 2% had
flush toilets, 56% had some other form of latrine, and 42% had no service.
1.06      Water Supply and sewerage/sanitation service levels were relatively
low in 1971 and may have declined since that date. 1/ In Sri Lanka no water
supply system consistently provides safe water because: supplies are inter-
mittent; the standard of treatment plant operation is low; chlorine supplies
are unreliable; and no authority or agency accepts responsibility for monitor-
ing water quality.
1.07      The Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) has attempted to prepare a compre-
hensive sector development plan for water supply and sewerage, but this work
was abandoned in 1976 because of staff shortages. Although GSL supports the
broad objectives set by the 1976 Habitat Conference, 2/ and reaffirmed by the
1977 United Nations (UN) Conference 3/ to supply all communities with piped
water and sanitation by 1990, no specific service level goals have been agreed
upon. However, GSL has linked the water supply and sanitation need to its
urban programs, which include the aim of providing 100,000 housing units by
1984, more than half of which are in the Greater Colombo area, and 75% of which
are intended for low income families.
The Project Area
1.08      The City of Colombo, the national capital and the largest city in
Sri Lanka (estimated 1979 population 0.64 million), forms the central urban
core of the project area. Colombo is the principal commercial and indus-
trial center of Sri Lanka and also the center of a large and rapidly growing
tourist industry; it is well linked to the remainder of the country by a
network of roads, has a large thriving port for international vessels and
has an international airport.
1.09      The project area includes urban development extending to the south
and north of Colombo, designated as Towns South and North, and comprising
ten municipalities as follows:
Towns South:  Dehiwala/Mt. Lavinia, Kolonnawa,
Kotte, Moratuwa, Panadura.
Towns North: Peliyagoda, Wattala/Mabole,
Kelaniya, Dalugama, Hendala.

1.10      The estimated 1979 population of the eleven municipal areas, in
which the project is located, was 1.5 million; the estimated 1979 population
of the project area was 1.1 million. The existing piped water supply system
is designed to serve the whole of the project area (Map IBRD 14818); the
existing and proposed water-borne sewerage system will serve Colombo, part
of Kolonnawa and part of the Dehiwala/Mt. Lavinia municipal areas (Map IBRD
14819).
1.11      GSL and WDB identified the project area from Master Plan and Feas-
ibility Studies of Water Supply and Sewerage Services for the Southwest
Coastal Area. These studies, (subsequently referred to as the UNDP Master
Plan Studies) and the resulting reports, were prepared in 1972 by consulting
engineers 1/ under contract to the World Health Organization (WHO), as exe-
cuting agency for the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). Parts of
the Master Plan and Feasibility Reports were revised in 1979 by engineering
consultants 2/ under contract to WDB, to reflect current population levels
and conditions. Since financial resources, and the implementation capacity
of the government agencies, are insufficient to permit immediate development
of piped water and sewerage services for the whole of the Colombo, Towns
South and Towns North urban areas, these services will be implemented in
stages, with priority given to areas of high population density and greater
need.
1.12      At the time of appraisal of the first Sri Lanka Water Supply
Project (Credit 709-CE), WDB planned to extend the water distribution system
to four additional Towns South (Kehelwatta, Kotikawatta, Kotte-Galkissa and
Maharagama) and four additional Towns North (Ja-ela, Kandana, Ragama and
Kanuwana) in 1983-84. These extension of the area of supply have now been
deferred because of the unexpected and rapid increase in demand for water
in the existing area of supply. It is probable that the Towns North exten-
sion will be completed in 1987 and the Towns South extension thereafter.
These extensions are not included in the proposed project.
1.13      The portion of the water supply plan which is to be implemented
under this project will increase the supply of piped water to the existing
service area, which includes the more densely developed parts of the urban
area (Map IBRD 14818) comprising about 150 square kilometers(sq. k). The
existing sewerage system serves a much smaller area, about 33 sq. k, within
the Colombo municipality. Under the project the capacity of the existing
sewerage system would be increased and the system would be extended to parts
of Kolonnawa and Dehiwala/Mt. Lavinia to serve about 0.65 million people
located in an area of about 40 sq. k.
The Existing Water System
1.14      Colombo and Towns South are the only parts of the project area
currently receiving piped water. Under the first Sri Lanka Water Supply
Project (Credit 709-CE) the level of supply to this area will be improved
and the area of supply will be increased to include-Towns North.

-4-
1.15      Except for small amounts of groundwater from privately constructed
shallow wells, there are three sources of water serving the project area.
Two of the sources are impounding, reservoirs, located in upland catchments
areas (Map IBRD 14818) at Labugama and Kalatuwawa, some 44 kilometers (km)
from Colombo. These sources have been developed to their full potential to
supply about 136 million liters per day (mld) which is equivalent to about
30 million imperial gallons per day (Imgd), of fully treated water.
1.16      Water from these sources flows by gravity through four parallel
mains to distribution reservoirs in the project area. The third source of
supply is the Kelani Ganga, a large river which has an extensive upland catch-
ment area to the northeast of Colombo and which discharges to the Indian Ocean,
close to Colombo. The works which withdraw water from the Kelani Ganga, treat
the water and pump it to the distribution system are located at Ambatale, some
14 km upstream from the coast, and 11 km from Colombo. The first Sri Lanka
Water Supply Project (Credit 709-CE) and the proposed project provide oppor-
tunities to coordinate development of the river water intake, river water
pumping station, components of the water treatment facility and the filtered
water pumping station, parts of which have been funded by various bilateral
aid projects and part by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)
and IDA under Credit 709-CE.
1.17      In 1979 the safe long-term yield of the three water sources was
245 mld (54 Imgd); however, in July 1980 the completion of pumping installa-
tions at Ambatale (under Credit 709-CE) will provide a capacity of 183 mld
(40 Imgd) at the Ambatale works and a total yield of 318 mld (70 Imgd) of
fully treated water from all sources.
1.18      In recent years it has become increasingly difficult to maintain
a 24-hour water supply to Colombo and Towns South and there is a tendency to
draw down the two impounding reservoirs (Labugama and Kalatuwawa) to levels
at which the reliability of these sources is severely reduced. This practice,
and failure of the southwest monsoon in 1976, resulted in a severe water short-
age and a reduction in the hours of supply to 4 to 6 hours per day. An even
more severe water shortage was averted by the temporary installation of pumps
to increase the quantity of water obtained from the Kelani Ganga, at Ambatale,
by about 30 mld (6 Imgd). This water is chlorinated but is not fully treated,
a procedure which does not produce a consistently safe water and one which is
therefore most unsatisfactory.
The Existing Sewerage System
1.19      The present Colombo sewerage system is the only waterborne sewer-
age system in operation in Sri Lanka. It is a separate 1/ sanitary system,
most of which was constructed between 1906 and 1913. Although there have
been limited extensions and renewals in recent years, the system is old and of
inadequate capacity. Small sewage treatment plants, which were part of the
original system and served the northern and southern drainage areas of Colombo,
became partially inoperative by 1918 and were finally taken out of service in
1/   Conveys sewage only and excludes most surface water.

1956. Since this date untreated sewage has been continuously discharged to the
lower reaches of the Kelani Ganga and to the sea.  By 1951 the sewage collection
and conveyance systems were heavily overloaded as the population of the service
area reached almost 0.4 million resulting in flows of about twice the design
capacity.
1.20      The existing sewerage system comprises about 240 km of sewers, 11
pumping stations and two abandoned treatment plants. The pumping equipment
and sewers are poorly maintained; although most of the sewers are structurally
sound their capacity is severely reduced by accumulations of sand, silt and
miscellaneous debris. Some of the poorer areas of the city are not served
by the system because of the relatively high cost of connecting properties
to the system. This deficiency would be corrected under the proposed project
(paragraph 3.10).
Population in the Project Area
1.21      Population data in the project area are based on the 1971 census
adjusted by rates of increase similar to those used in the Master Plan Studies.
Water consumption data are conjectural since bulk meters for the measurement
of water from sources, headworks and distribution reservoirs are only now
being repaired or replaced, and it is therefore not yet possible to formulate
a precise account of water drawn from each source or transmitted to each area
of demand. The consumer metering program under the first project has only
recently reached the stage where meters are actually being installed.
1.22      Three separate population projections are available for the
project area. These were prepared under the UNDP Master Plan Studies, the
Statistical Abstract by the Government Department of Census and Statistics
(1978) and the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Study by the WHO/IBRD Coop-
erative Programme, New Delhi (1978). These studies forecast a marked decline
in the rate of population increase over the period 1963 to 1990. It is pos-
sible that population growth and water demands forecast by WDB may be excessive.
However, this would delay by only a few years the time when additional works
will be required or, alternatively, would enable WDB to bring forward the date
by which the distribution system would be extended to urban areas adjacent to
Colombo, which require piped water.
1.23      WDB's forecasts of the population of the water supply project area
(Table 1.1) include that portion of Towns North which will receive piped water
in 1982 on completion of works under the first Sri Lanka Water Supply Project
(Credit 709-CE), and the area of Towns North to which an extension of the
distribution system is planned to be completed in 1988. The 1988 extension
does not form part of this project because construction work is not scheduled
to begin until 1985 or 1986. Previously proposed distribution system exten-
sions in Towns South have been deferred until after 1988 and are therefore not
included in the project area or in the population projections in Table 1.1.

Water Demand and Consumption
1.24      WDB estimates that about 0.4 million people in the project area
obtain water from public taps. These taps are located in public streets or
within the property boundaries of groups of buildings which house multiple
single room tenements. 1/ The taps are provided by local authorities and
supply water which is free to the consumer; the cost of the water is met by
the Central Government, based upon the estimated or metered quantity consumed.
1.25       In the absence of reliable metering, water consumption data is based
on field measurements obtained during the UNDP Master Plan Studies, subse-
quently modified by WDB and supported by work carried out as part of a recent
tariff study. 2/
1.26      Estimates of per capita water consumption are higher than those
for other countries of South Asia, particularly the consumption of water at
public taps. In Sri Lanka people who use public taps bathe and wash clothes
and utensils at the taps, and carry back to dwellings only a small part of the
water used. This procedure, coupled with an obvious enthusiasm throughout the
community for thorough cleanliness, results in daily per capita water con-
sumption, at public taps, of 50 to 60 liters per capita per day (lcd) or 11
to 13 Imperial gallons per capita per day (Igcd).
1.27      Estimates of current water consumption by connected domestic con-
sumers is also higher than in similar areas of South Asia. In the absence of
metering it is assumed that waste forms a large portion of the 1979 per capita
consumption of 225 lcd (50 Igcd). Per capita consumption is projected to
decline to about 145 lcd as meters are installed and metered tariffs are
applied, followed by a slight increase in later years (1991) as demands
increase with higher incomes and living standards (Table 1.2).

1.28      The figures derived by WDB (Table 1.3) are based on pumping outputs,
field measurement of representative user categories and estimates. The mis-
sion estimates that the figures relating to water available at headworks and
total demand are reasonably accurate but that the estimate of losses and water
consumed by the various categories of consumers are approximate. It is
unlikely that distribution system losses will be reduced below 25% of the
estimated flow to the system; water saved by an effective leakage detection
and control program may be offset by higher losses resulting from improved
pressures and a continuous supply. Losses from distribution systems are
rarely below 20% and, in older systems, frequently exceed 25%.

1984.
/e   Includes transmission and distribution system losses as a
percentage of flow, and use of water at the three treatment
plants as a percentage of water treated.
1.29      The project would enable water demands to be met to about 1990 when
further development of works at Ambatale would be required. The additional
water made available by the project would permit discontinuation of the
emergency supply of partially treated river water and would also allow the
impounding sources to be operated within their design capacity, thus restoring
the reliability of the system. By these means the project would improve the
quantity and quality of piped water to a population of almost 1.5 million
(1984) rising to 2.2 million in 1991. The system would provide water to the
entire community, including the poor (paragraph 5.04), within the project area.
Demand for Access to the Sewerage Service
1.30      An area of about 33 sq. k, comprising 80% of the Colombo municipal
area, is served by the existing sewerage system. About 50% of the housing
units in Colombo are connected to the system. Under the Municipal Council
Ordinance, owners of premises located within one hundred feet (30 meters) of
a public drain (or sewer) may be required to connect to the drain or sewer
and to convert any existing facilities within the premises to a form suitable
for use with the public system. Colombo Municipality has been reluctant to
enforce the ordinance since the system is grossly overloaded. Moreover,
poorer property owners have failed to connect to the system because of the
relatively high cost of doing so and the absence of any mechanism for financing
the costs.



-9-
1.31      Renovation and extension of the sewerage system under the project
would provide sufficient capacity for all properties in the sewered area to be
connected. Furthermore, a proposed program of assistance to property owners
would enable them to afford connections (paragraph 3.10).
1.32      Under the Municipal Ordinance, Councils are required to provide
and maintain adequate public latrines for the use of the general public and
for residents of temporary housing or slums. Although the construction of
latrines does not form part of the project, local authorities propose to
implement a program to improve access to the sewerage system by providing
more public latrines and improving their maintenance standards. Local author-
ities expressed the view that severe difficulties in maintaining public
latrines will persist and that efforts should be made to provide private
latrines for each dwelling unit.
1.33      Local authorities will continue to provide or administer alter-
native services for the disposal of wastes from areas not served by the water-
borne sewerage systems; such services include conservancy services (bucket,
latrines), septic tanks, soakage pits, pit latrines, etc.
II. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
Lending Arrangements
2.01      The recipient of the credit, GSL, will onlend the proceeds of the
credit to WDB, the beneficiary and the implementing agency, under terms accept-
able to the Association (paragraph 4.27).
organization
2.02      Legislation for the creation of WDB was enacted in 1974; it pro-
vides for WDB to operate water and sewerage facilities with a parallel pro-
vision for local authorities to operate their facilities, subject to WDB and
Ministry approval. The 1974 Law also deals with general operational matters,
including rates for water supply and sewerage, and prescribes penalties for
pollution of water sources used for water supply. WDB is a corporate body
consisting of 8 members appointed by MLG; four members are Government officers
and the remaining four members are appointed from among interested citizens
having experience in engineering, finance, public health, administration or
law.
2.03      The headquarters of WDB is located in Ratmalana, a suburb of Colombo.
Several regional offices are maintained in locations throughout the country
depending on the development works being implemented in the various regions.
Although the general manager is nominally the chief executive officer, this
duty is also currently being performed by the chairman. Under the organiza-
tional structure of WDB (Annex 5), four functional deputy general managers
report to the general manager, who in turn reports to the chairman. At the



- 10 -
next level are six assistant general managers, two of whom are responsible
for finance and design, and four of whom are responsible for the geographical
areas. All assistant general managers are located at WDB's headquarters.
2.04      Because the first project (Credit 709-CE) formed a large part of
its total water supply program, WDB formed a special unit, under an assistant
general manager, to implement the project (Annex 5). At negotiations, WDB's
assurances were obtained that it will retain and strengthen this unit, with
staffing functions and responsibilities satisfactory to the Association.
Organizational Staffing
2.05      WDB has capable and experienced engineering staff competent to design
and construct works. The approved establishment for engineers is 160 of which
about 50 posts were vacant at the time of appraisal. During the past 4 to 5
years there has been difficulty in retaining experienced engineers in the face
of more attractive terms of service being offered in some foreign countries.
Suitably experienced engineers are not available for local recruitment and
there are insufficient incentives to attract foreign engineers. Thus the
standard of WDB engineering expertise has declined. This is particularly
noticeable in the higher levels where only 5 of the 22 chief engineer posts
are filled. There appears to be no means of reversing this trend. The Gov-
ernment is concerned over this situation and, in response to a recent request,
has now received three experienced public health engineers from WHO. WDB is
also using the services of engineering consultants to implement part of its
development works program. WDB's staffing position is as follows:

Management and Finance
2.06      Measures to correct deficiencies in WDB's management and finance
functions were introduced under the first project (Credit 709-CE). Agreements
were reached with GSL and WDB to:
-    adequately staff the accounting department and to fill
senior finance posts;
-    establish financial regulations and identify financial
policies and procedures;
-    improve coordination of the engineering and finance
sections of WDB;
-    establish systems for commercial accounting, financial
control, and purchasing and stores.



- 12 -
Although these steps now appear to be quite modest, they were regarded as
major in the situation which existed in 1976 during appraisal of the first
project. At the time WDB had recently been formed from a Government depart-
ment, from which it inherited an accounting system designed for government
departments financed from consolidated government revenue. The accounts were
primarily a record of cash receipts and payments; neither a balance sheet nor
income statement was prepared. The accounting records consisted mainly of
appropriation ledgers with the pr:imary purpose of ensuring that no money was
spent contrary to the intention of the legislature, which placed the emphasis
on the control of cash rather than operating results.
2.07      Because of the inadequacy of accounting information,management
neglected financial control as a management tool in WDB's operation; WDB was
reluctant, or even unable to begin to operate as a commercially oriented
public utility rather than a government department.  It was recognized that
correction of these serious management, financial and institutional deficien-
cies, which existed at the early stage of WDB's development, would take time,
and would only be possible with the gradual appreciation and acceptance by
management of a commercial type of operation.
2.08      Although there has been progress in improving WDB's management and
finance functions, it has been slower than anticipated because of unforeseen
difficulties, primarily associated with the increasing exodus of experienced
professional officers to foreign countries. In addition, WDB is experiencing
increasing pressures from MLG to assume greater responsibilities, and to
implement a very sharply increasing development program. These factors have
tended to prevent WDB from achieving internal reforms, since its entire
efforts have been directed toward satisfying external demands.
2.09      In the light of these difficulties much remains to be accomplished
in the program of needed organizational, management and financial reforms in
WDB. It is now clear that the task is greater and more difficult than-was
originally envisaged. Means of accelerating and intensifying the program
of reforms have been devised and are being implemented; others are included
under the proposed project.
WDB's New Accounting System
2.10      In September 1979, WDB retained a local firm of organization, man-
agement and finance (OMF), consultants 1/ to design and place into operation
a commercial accounting system. The system was brought into operation in
January 1980 and a team of consultants is now training WDB personnel in its
use. The system is suitable for public utility accounting, is designed to
provide financial information to management, and is satisfactory.

Associates of Pakistan.

Organizational and Management Reforms
2.11      To obtain maximum benefit from the new accounting system, WDB
proposes to review its organizational structure and management procedures
to ensure that the organization can respond to the information generated.
To this end, the project provides for a study of the existing organization
by consultants.
2.12      Despite efforts by WDB's management, there has been no significant
progress towards managing the organization as a public utility. Furthermore,
financial planning remains a serious deficiency and development plans for
water supply, sewerage and sanitation for the entire country have not yet been
developed. Specific management and staff responsibilities are not clearly
identified and procedures to achieve coordination of the efforts of individuals
and of departments have not been established.
Water Retailing by WDB
2.13      In addition to its present role as the principal national agency
in the water supply sector (concerned with planning, engineering design, con-
struction and operation of bulk water supply facilities), WDB will assume
responsibility for retail water supply and sewerage services in the Greater
Colombo area, in the near future (paragraph 4.14). This additional task will
require the establishment of a new unit within WDB's organization, especially
trained in meter reading, retail billing and revenue collection. These func-
tions are currently the responsibility of local authorities. Staffing and
staff training will form major parts of the task of establishing WDB's revenue
collection unit, and should be substantially completed prior to the assumption
of responsibilities from local authorities.
Institutional Developments
2.14      To achieve these organizational and management reforms, GSL and WDB
propose an extensive program of assistance from consultants specializing in
organization, management and finance. This program would include not only
a study of organization and management procedures, leading to recommended
improvements, but also extensive training of staff by consultants to bring
the revised procedures into operation. In addition GSL and WDB have agreed
to the Association's proposal that, under the project, a management adviser
be appointed to WDB for a period of two to three years. The adviser would be
assigned at the same level as the Chairman of WDB and would report to both
the Chairman and the Secretary, MLG.
2.15      Assurances were obtained at negotiations, that WDB will retain
consultants specializing in organization, management and finance to:
-    study WDB's organizational structure and recommend reforms;
-    design, and bring into operation, new management procedures,
including associated training of WDB personnel; and



- 14 -
identify the structure of a revenue unit to be formed
within WDB, for billing and collecting revenues from
metered water sales in the project area; assist WDB to
staff this unit and to train its personnel.
The selection and appointment of consultants, acceptable to the Association,
as an initial step in this program would be a condition of credit effective-
ness.
2.16      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that GSL would appoint,
for a period of 2 to 3 years, a management adviser to WDB, acceptable to the
Association and to be in position by January 1, 1981. The adviser would
operate at the same level as, and would report to the Chairman, WDB; the
adviser would also report to the Secretary, MLG.
Financial Staffing
2.17      The significant exodus of experienced technical, managerial and
financial professionals from Sri Lanka during the past five years has par-
ticularly affected WDB.  Its saLaries and benefits are slightly below those
in some other Government departments, and substantially below those offered
by the private sector. The difficulties in staffing WDB's senior financial
posts have therefore continued. Staff tend to leave WDB after a brief tenure,
primarily to obtain better terms of service in the private sector, but some-
times to take positions which do not appear to offer significant advantages;
this suggests that job satisfaction also may be a factor influencing staff
decisions. GSL has not yet been able to resolve this problem since offering
incentives to Government staff merely provokes a similar offer in the private
sector.
2.18      WDB's agreement under the first project (Credit 709-CE), to fill
senior finance posts and to adequately staff the accounting department of
WDB will be continued under the proposed project. Assurances were also
obtained at negotiations that WDB will supplement its staff by retaining a
suitably qualified and experienced firm of accountants, if WDB's finance and
accounting staff is unable to adequately carry out its duties in a manner
satisfactory to the Association.
Computerization of Accounts
2.19      Computerized accounting, billing, stores management and control
functions, as well as the training of WDB's staff in appropriate accounting
have been included under the project.  It is estimated that computerized
systems would be in operation by the end of 1983.
Audit
2.20      Under the first project (Credit 709-CE) WDB agreed to provide
audited financial statements to the Association within six months of the end
of each financial year. Because of the inadequacy of its accounts, WDB could
not comply with this requirement. With improved accounting, audited statements



- 15 -
have significant value to both WDB and the Association.  At negotiations,
assurances were obtained that WDB will furnish to the Association audited
financial statements together with the accompanying auditor's report within
six months of the close of each financial year beginning with the audit
report for 1980.
2.21      WDB has cited that its inability to provide audited statements
on a timely basis resulted from the Auditor General's lateness in performing
the audit. At negotiations, assurances were obtained that WDB will appoint
a suitably qualified, independent auditing firm prior to September 30, 1980
(for the 1980 audit report) and thereafter prior to the beginning of each
financial year to assure that audited statements for such financial year are
prepared and available on time.
Insurance
2.22      WDB agreed that materials and equipment for the project will be
insured as under the first project. All other public utility risks will
be adequately insured in a manner consistent with standard practice in Sri
Lanka and similar to that used in the first project.
III. THE PROJECT
The Water Supply and Sewerage Program
3.01      In 1972, Master Plan Studies to the Year 2000 for Water Supply and
Sewerage for the South West Coastal Area were completed by Howard Humphreys
and Sons, Consulting Engineers of the United Kingdom, under contract to the
WHO as executing agency for UNDP. As part of this contract, the consulting
engineers also completed Preliminary Engineering and Feasibility Studies
of water supply and sewerage requirements for the first five years of the
Master Plan period.
3.02      Parts of the program recommended under these Master Plan and Feasi-
bility Reports were implemented under bilateral assistance from France and the
United Kingdom. Part of the program is being implemented under the first IDA
assisted Sri Lanka Water Supply Project (Credit 709-CE), and part of the pro-
gram is proposed for inclusion in the second Sri Lanka Water Supply and
Sewerage Project.
3.03      The first project was planned for completion by December 1980, but
has now been extended by a period of two years. Credit 709-CE, which became
effective in February 1978, included IDA assistance of US$9.2 million and a
CIDA contribution of US$4.8 million both of which were provided to meet
foreign exchange costs. An additional credit of US$7.0 million in the form
of an EEC Special Action Credit has been approved to meet projected cost over
runs under Credit 709-CE arising from the high inflation of prices, and to
finance part of the civil works costs which were not financed under the IDA
credit.



- 16 -
3.04      The objectives of thie first Sri Lanka Water Supply Project
(Credit 709-CE) were to relieve water shortages in the Colombo Municipal
area and Towns South and to extend the piped water system to Towns North.
The project also provided for new water supply systems to be constructed
to serve the towns of Kalutara, Ambalangoda and adjacent urban areas.
3.05      The first project also provided an opportunity to establish
important institutional improvements, particularly the integration of
water sources, treatment and transmission facilities serving the Greater
Colombo area under the control of one agency, WDB. The project was also
intended to assist the then, newly formed WDB to strengthen its organization
and capacity as a national water and sewerage agency. In addition to the
further aim of providing a safe and continuous supply of water to all sections
of the community in the project: area, the project was designed to extend
consumer metering to the entire connected population in the project area,
thus discouraging waste and excessive water consumption.
3.06      Many unforeseen difficulties were encountered from the beginning
of the first project. Project delays resulted from political unrest and
civil riots which occured between June 1977, when the credit was signed, and
February 1978 when the credit became effective. The new Government was fully
occupied with major national issues during 1978, its first year in office, and
very little was therefore achieved in the first year of the project implemen-
tation period. However, following this period, WDB made remarkable progress
in preparing procurement documents for both the purchase of materials and for
civil works contracts. Despite the continuing loss of professional staff,
very substantial progress in project implementation has been made, as well as
progress in preparing a further program of works, completing a tariff study
and meeting the financial targets identified in the first project (paragraph
4.05).
3.07      Disbursements under Credit 709-CE at March 31, 1980 had reached
US$7.7 million and WDB estimates that disbursements will reach US$10 million
by September 1, 1980. Fourteen of the total of 18 civil works contracts under
the first project (Credit 709-CE) had been awarded at the time of negotiations
of the proposed credit; the remaining 4 contracts are expected to be awarded
by January 31, 1981.
3.08      The augmentation of the water supply to the Greater Colombo area will
be completed by July 1980 and it is estimated that most of the remaining works
under the first project will be completed by December 1982. Although the
implementation of a consumer metering program has not achieved the required
level, sound preparations for an accelerated program have been made (paragraph
3.12). New targets have been agreed upon by GSL and WDB for the implementation
of works and institutional reforms proposed under the first project. Thus the
first project will achieve much of its original purpose, albeit some two years
after the originally scheduled date.

The Project Description
3.09      The principal project elements are illustrated in Maps IBRD 14818
and 14819, described in Annex I and summarized as follows:
Water Supply
(a) Construction of a river water intake on the Kelani Ganga;
the capacity of structure is 305 mld (67 Imdg) and the initial
pumping capacity is 130 mld (28.5 Imgd);
(b) Construction of a transmission main from the intake at (a)
to Ambatale treatment plant, with a capacity 130 mid (28.5 Lmgd);
(c) Construction of two sedimentation tanks, with a combined
capacity of 122 mid (27 Imgd), at Ambatale treatment plant;
(d) Modification of 12 of the existing 18 filters at Amabatale
treatment plant to increase their capacity to 205 mld (45
lmgd) and the plant capacity to 305 mld (67 Imgd);
(e) Provision and installation of additional chemical feed equip-
ment at Ambatale treatment plant;
(f) Construction of a pumping station and transmission main with
a capacity of 30 mld (6.7 Imgd), to convey water to Kolonnawa;
(g) Construction of: a distribution reservoir, capacity 11 ml
(2.4 Img); pumping station, capacity 23.6 mld (5.2 Imgd)
and a 2.5 km long transmission main at Kolonnawa.
Sewerage
(h) Construction of sewage collection and conveyance facilities in
Colombo including: renovation of 4.5 km of sewers, modification
and improvement of 10 sewerage pumping stations, and the con-
struction of 16 km of force mains;
(i) Construction of sewage disposal facilities including two ocean
outfalls;
(j) Construction of sewage collection and conveyance systems in
Kolonnawa and Mount Lavinia including 25.5 km of sewers, 5
sewage pumping stations and 4.3 km of force mains.
Other Items
(k) Provision of replacement and spare parts for existing plant
and equipment, provision of vehicles for construction and
maintenance works, and of miscellaneous items of equipment,
including computerized billing equipment and sewer cleaning
equipment.



- 18 -
(1) Engineering, management and finance consultants' services
for: detailed design of a further group of water supply
and sewerage works; a distribution study for the Colombo
Municipal area and Towns South; a solid waste collection
and disposal study for the Colombo Municipal area; an
organization management and finance study for WDB including
the implementation of recommended management procedures
and policies, establishment of systems and procedures for
computerized billing, and for stores management, financial
accounting and control.
(m)  Training for WDB's finance and management staff, engineers
plant chemists, plant superintendents and operators.
Property Connections to the Sewerage System
3.10      Despite the requirement under the Municipal Councils Ordinance,
that properties within 100 feet (30 m) of a public sewer be connected to the
sewerage system, the requirement is rarely enforced. Connection costs, which
are sometimes as much as Rs 2,000 (US$130), have discouraged lower-income
consumers from connecting to the system. Under new arrangements which GSL
proposes to introduce prior to completion of the new sewerage system, GSL will
provide grants, and/or loans to owners of properties who are required to
connect to the system. At negotiations GSL gave assurances that by January 1,
1982 it will implement a program acceptable to the Association, under which
it will provide assistance to lower income property owners, within the project
area, to meet the cost of sewer connections; such assistance will be in the
form of grants equivalent to 100% of the cost of connections for owners of
properties of lower rateable values but with grants declining as property
values increase. In areas in which WDB has assumed responsibility for sewerage
operations, owners of properties within 100 meters of a public sewer system
are required to connect to that system under Law No. 2 of 1974, the law which
established WDB.
Metering
3.11      A program included in the first Sri Lanka Water Supply Project
(Credit 709-CE), under which water meters were to be installed on all con-
nections to domestic premises, has fallen far behind schedule. Factors
contributing to this delay include: a long delay in the provision of meters
by the United Kingdom Overseas Development Administration (ODA); 1/ a reluc-
tance on the part of local authorities to accept the concept of metering
and associated tariffs and; technical difficulties in installing the meters
associated primarily with the inadequacy of maps and records of connections
and the poor condition of many connections.
1/   At the time of appraisal, some 10,000 meters had been received out of
40,000; the remaining 30,000 are firmly scheduled for delivery in
Sri Lanka in two shipments arriving by April 30 and May 31, 1980.

3.12      These initial difficulties are gradually being overcome.  The
concept of metering is strongly supported by GSL. Local authorities have
begun to accept the need the conserve water and to regard it as a valuable
resource. WDB has obtained technical assistance (paragraph 3.15) to begin the
task of revising distribution plans and consumers' connection records. As a
result of these measures, some 2,400 meters were installed by January 31,
1980. WDB has proposed a revised realistic metering program which will ensure
that, in addition to the 2,400 meters which have been installed, not less than
1,000 additional meters will be installed each month. Under this program,
metering in Kolonnawa, Kotte and Panadura would be completed by December 1981,
Moratuwa by June 1982, Dehiwala/Mt. Lavinia by December 1983 and Colombo by
December 1988.  In addition, meters will be installed on all new connections
as the connections are provided. WDB would also continue its on-going program
to establish an effective meter testing and repair facility. At negotiations
WDB's assurances were obtained that:
(a) consumer meters will be installed on existing connections
in the project area at a rate of not less than 1,000 meters
per month; and
(b) in addition in metered areas, meters will be installed on
all new connections when the connections are provided.
3.13      WDB's assurances were obtained that an ongoing program to install
and thereafter effectively maintain bulk meters, to accurately measure flows
from all treatment plants, major pumping installations, distribution reservoirs
and to accurately measure bulk supplies to local authorities in the project
area will be completed by June 30, 1981.
Distribution System Maintenance
3.14      Under the present conditions of low pressure and intermittent supply,
distribution system losses are estimated to be about 25% of the flow reaching
the distribution system. The losses would be very much higher under normal
system pressures and with a continuous supply. WDB therefore proposes to
intensify its distribution system leakage detection and repair program to
ensure that leakage is controlled as the water supply system is improved
under the project.
3.15      A team of engineers from the Danish Hydraulic Institute, Copenhagen,
has recently completed a study of the required improvements of distribution
system plans, consumers connection records and of the present leakage control
program in the project area, to assist WDB to formulate suitable programs
by which improvements may be implemented. At negotiations, WDB undertook that
it will (a) improve the detection of distribution system losses and improve
the implementation of mains repairs; (b) prepare adequate plans of the dis-
tribution system; (c) prepare accurate registers of water consumers and
consumers' connections; (d) establish system and procedures for keeping these
plans and registers up-to-date, all in accordance with a program to be reviewed
by June 30, 1980 and to be acceptable to the Association.

Financing
3.18      A credit of US$30 million from the Saudi Fund for Development
(SFD) is likely to be available on a parallel financing basis, and an IDA
credit of US$30 million is proposed. The total of the proposed credits, US$60
million, is about 73% of the project cost of US$82 million, excluding customs
duty and taxes, which amount to US$12 million. During negotiations GSL
undertook that if funds are not made available from SFD, then GSL would
arrange alternative financing from another donor or from its own resources.

Project Design, Construction and Supervision
3.19      WDB has overall responsibility for project design and construction.
Project designs and procurement documents have been completed with the aid of



- 22 -
engineering consultants, 1/ financed under the first project (Credit 709-CE).
WDB engineering staff will plan and control project development and supervise
parts of the project construction, particularly the water supply components.
At present, WDB has few engineers with experience in the construction of large
sewerage works and will, therefore, appoint consulting engineers to supervise
the construction of these works (paragraph 3.20). This is a critical item in
the project schedule and the appointment of suitable consulting engineers, who
are acceptable to the Association will, therefore, be a condition of credit
effectiveness.
Services of Engineering and Management Consultants
3.20      Engineering consultants' charges for supervision of construction of
the sewerage components of the project have been estimated as 4% of the base
costs (excluding contingencies, duty and taxes) of construction of these
components.
3.21      It is estimated that the study and report in connection with the
collection and disposal of solid wastes in the Colombo Municipal area will
be completed by two specialists in this field, in a period of 6 months at
a total estimated cost of US$140,000. This includes man-month costs at
US$10,000 per man-month, with additional charges of US$20,000 for printing,
local transportation and miscellaneous minor items.
3.22      The estimated cost of engineering consultants' services for a feasi-
bility report and the detailed en,gineering design of works to be included in a
possible future project is US$1.5 million. This estimate is based on 6% of the
construction cost of US$25 million, which has been updated from the Master Plan
Report.
3.23      The estimated cost of engineering consultants' services for a
detailed study and report on the water distribution system in the Greater
Colombo area, including complete mapping of the system, is US$1.0 million.
A joint venture contract is envisaged (between one local and one foreign
firm) providing for 210 man-months of consultants' services, and the cost of
vehicles, survey, survey equipment, mains flow testing equipment, and minor
items. The average man-month cost (including salary, costs, fees, interna-
tional travel and subsistence) is US$3,640; the average local man-month cost
is US$1,100 (150 man-months) and the average expatriate man-month cost is
US$10,000 (60 man-months). The expatriate personnel input comprises senior
level, high caliber expertise in distribution system analysis.
3.24      The estimated cost of an organization study for WDB, which includes
the design and implementation of management procedures and data processing,
is US$0.7 million. The duration of this study and implementation program
is 3 years. The average man-month cost (including salary, costs, fees,
international travel and subsistence) is expected to be US$1,040; the average
local man-month cost is US$800 (500 man-months) and the average foreign
man-month cost is US$7,000 (20 man-months). The total estimated cost also
includes provision for local transportation, local office expenses and minor
items.

Implementation Schedule
3.25      WDB plans to implement the project over a four-year period, begin-
ning with the award of contracts in the last quarter of 1980 and the first
quarter of 1981, and concluding the work on the project completion date of
September 30, 1984. Project preparation procedures are well advanced; all of
the engineering designs have been completed and are scheduled to be reviewed
by WDB by May 31, 1980. Bids will then be invited for most of the project
equipment, and almost all contracts are expected to be awarded by the first
quarter of 1982.
Procurement
3.26      All contracts for equipment and materials and all civil works
contracts financed by the IDA credit will be awarded under international
competitive bidding procedures in accordance with the Association's guide-
lines, with the exception of items costing less than US$100,000 with an
aggregate value of not more than US$1.0 million. Such items, and civil
works contracts for sewers which are not financed by the IDA credit, would
be purchased under local procurement procedures which are acceptable to the
Association. It is recommended that IDA should review all documents and
proposed awards for all items financed by the IDA credit.
3.27      In evaluating bids for equipment and materials, domestic manu-
facturers would be given a preferential margin equal to 15% of the c.i.f.
costs of the competing imports or the existing rate of customs duty,
whichever is lower. A preferential margin of 7-1/2% would be allowed for
local contractors in evaluating civil works bids. Most, if not all, of the
contracts for equipment and materials supply and most of the major civil works
contracts, for which there is little local expertise, are likely to be won by
foreign contractors.
Disbursements
3.28      The proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed over a four-year
period in accordance with an estimated disbursement schedule (Annex 4).
Disbursements would be made as follows:
(a) Equipment and Materials (US$20.0 million)
For equipment and materials procured after international
competitive bidding, 100% of foreign expenditures for
directly imported goods, or 100% of local expenditures
(ex-factory costs) for locally manufactured goods. For
goods procured under local procurement procedures 60%
of local expenditures.
(b) Civil Works, Excluding Sewers and Force Mains (US$1.5 million)
For contracts awarded as a result of international competitive
bidding, 100% of expenditures.



- 24 -
(c) Consultants' Services and Training (US$8.5 million)
100% of expenditures for training, and 100% of expendi-
tures for consultants' services.
Land Acquisition
3.29      A very small area of land, about 2 hectares (ha), is required
for the project. About 60% of this area is Government land; the remainder
will be acquired under existing legislation. The land requirements would
have no impact on the Government's agricultural program and no significant
resettlement is necessary. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
from GSL and WDB that land for the project will be acquired in accordance
with a program acceptable to the Association.
Environmental and Health Impact
3.30      The sewerage component of the project will improve sanitation and
public health in the area by eliminating overflows of raw sewage to the storm
water drainage systems and streets. Construction of ocean outfalls will
eliminate the present practice of dumping raw sewage into the Kelani river
within the municipal boundary of Colombo and hence also will reduce health
hazards in the project area. Oceanographic studies of the outfall designs
have shown that adequate dispersicon will be achieved and that the likelihood
of surface contamination or shore pollution will be minimized. The water
supply component will ensure present average levels of supply to be maintained
through about 1992. Enlarged treatment and storage facilities will improve
water quality significantly. Introduction of metered charges may improve the
distribution of available water among households and thus the distribution of
health benefits.
IV. FINANCE
Background
4.01       In 1975, WDB was transformed from the government Department of Water
Supply, where it functioned mainly as a technical entity, into a Board with
characteristics of a public utility enterprise. Upon its formation, WDB
assumed title as well as responsibility for the operation and maintenance of
certain water production assets belonging to its predecessor government
organization, including the water treatment plant at Ambatale. Since then,
WDB has assumed responsibility, together with all related assets, for water
production and transmission and sewerage services within the project area;
therefore, WDB's present project area revenue derives from the bulk sale of
treated water to local authorities who have the responsibility for its distri-
bution to the ultimate consumer.
4.02      Outside the project areas WDB has acted primarily as an engineer-
contractor in the development of water supply and distribution projects for
the benefit of local authorities. More recently, as a result of shifts in
government policy, WDB has assumed ownership and operating control over many



- 25 -
of the water supply projects with the result that it now also acts as the
seller of bulk water to many village, town and rural authorities nationwide.
4.03      At the time the first project (Credit 709-CE) was appraised, WDB
was in the early stages of changing from a government type accounting system,
which emphasized the control of cash with little regard for operating results,
into a commercial accounting system appropriate to a public utility. This
changeover was complicated by WDB's lack of suitably qualified and trained
accounting staff, particularly at senior and management levels. The rapid
expansion of WDB's activities, well beyond the scope that had been conter-
plated when the first project was appraised, has further compounded the
accounting difficulties; WDB's limited accounting staff could barely keep
pace with the escalating number of transactions and could neither develop nor
institutionalize the systems needed to provide timely and reliable information
regarding WDB's increasingly complex and geographically diverse operations.
4.04      Because of these continuing difficulties, WDB's accounts provide
an unreliable chronicle of financial events for the years 1976-1979 and are
of limited value as bases for projecting WDB's future. A program to improve
the reliability and timeliness of financial information in the future was
developed in consultation between WDB, GSL and the Association and is currently
in varying stages of implementation (paragraph 2.10).
Past and Present Financial Performance
4.05      Estimates of WDB's financial performance for 1979 in the project
area are provided in Annexes 7-9. Estimates of WDB's consolidated financial
performance for 1978 and 1979 are displayed in Annexes 11-13. These esti-
mates indicate that WDB has complied with the revenue targets for 1978 and
1979 established under the first project (Credit 709-CE). Further, these
estimates reveal several potentially troubling financial trends.
4.06      Whereas WDB has attempted to comply with the first project's require-
ment that accounts for the project area be kept separate from WDB's other
activities, no effort has been made to monitor the financial performance of
those other activities. Thus, while there is evidence that WDB is generating
surplus revenues within the project area as was intended under the first
project, evidence also exists that WDB is realizing substantial losses in those
other activities. It is impossible to identify the extent and nature of these
losses; however, it is clear that WDB has had to divert the surplus revenue
generated within the project area to cover those deficits, a situation which
the first project sought to discourage. GSL and WDB affirm that this situation
has existed because available accounting information was inadequate to permit
the timely identification of both the problems and appropriate remedial actionls.
The new accounting system and the related program of management reforms (para-
graphs 2.10 and 2.11), effectively implemented, are expected to resolve this
deficiency in the future.
4.07      WDB's past accounts do identify some operating losses as attribut-
able to the sale of bulk water outside the project area; however, they have



- 26 -
not provided information about WDB's performance as an engineer-contractor. 1/
Since most of these activities have been funded by GSL based on budgeted cost
estimates increased by a modest (12%) overhead allowance, and since no past
attempt was made to reconcile costs actually incurred with those estimates,
WDB has never realized any recovery of cost overruns, estimated by WDB's
finance department at 30% per project. The new acounting system will
consider each of WDB's regions and its engineer-contractor activity as cost
centers. WDB and GSL can then scrutinize the pricing mechanism prevailing
in each cost center on a regular basis. GSL has indicated its willingness
to adjust these pricing mechanisms to assure each activity's financial
viability. At negotiations, WDB renewed its agreement to take all steps
required to ensure that revenues will be at a level so that operations outside
the project area are not subsidized by revenues from the project area.
4.08      Within the project area, the local authorities have frequently
lacked the liquidity to meet their water bills on time and WDB has frequently
relied on GSL's agreement under the first project to guarantee the prompt
payment of such bills. This has either involved GSL advancing money to the
local authorities so that they may remit the required payment or remitting
payments directly to WDB while making compensating adjustments to GSL's
current accounts with the local authorities. This guarantee remains critical
for assuring WDB of sufficient operating liquidity for its activities within
the project area; therefore, at negotiations, GSL renewed its agreement to
ensure that bills rendered by WDB to local authorities in the project area
are duly and promptly paid.
4.09      In both 1977 and 1978, WDB's finance department allocated 67.5%
of overhead incurred to Construction Work in Progress. The accounting
staff has never clearly articulated its reasons for capitalizing overhead
at such a seemingly excessive rate. The finance department has suggested
that this rate will be reduced to 50% in 1979. During 1980, from information
derived by using the new accounting system, WDB will more precisely identify
the appropriate allocation of overhead to the construction of its new fixed
assets. WDB will capitalize this percentage of overhead and expense the
remainder. WDB will continue to check the validity of this percentage period-
ically to maintain the credibility of its year-end statements.
Fixed Assets
4.10      During the past several years, GSL has ordered the transfer of
title to substantial amounts of aging fixed assets to WDB. Within the
project area, these transfers include the impounding reservoirs at Labugama
and Kalatuwawa together with related treatment and transmission facilities and,
more recently, the Colombo sewerage system. These assets were not catalogued
in detail at the time of construction and WDB and its predecessors were lax
about their maintenance of asset registers. For accounting purposes, WDB
proposed the use of best estimates of the gross value and accumulated depre-
ciation of these assets; this appears acceptable. At the same time, for
1/   A government agency providing an engineering service to local authorities
on a fixed price or fee basis.



- 27 -
engineering and maintenance puposes, WDB will catalogue those assets. At
negotiations, WDB has undertaken to complete the detailed cataloging of all
its fixed assets not later than December 31, 1982 and maintains accurate
asset registers thereafter.
4.11      Since, at the time of appraisal of the first project, WDB was
expected to remain a service organization and asset revaluation was not
accepted practice in Sri Lanka, WDB's financial targets were based on his-
torically valued net fixed assets. Now, however, WDB has fixed assets valued
at more than Rs 330 million (US$21 million) either in operation or under
construction, and plans to increase that value to about Rs 1,200 million
(US$77 million) by the end of 1980. It is therefore increasingly important
that WDB maintain an awareness of the impact of inflation on the replacement
value of its plant and equipment. Accordingly, at negotiations, WDB's agree-
ment was obtained to annual revaluation of its fixed assets in operation in
accordance with a procedure acceptable to the Association.
Retailing 1/
4.12      At the time of appraisal of the first project, numerous discussions
were held between representatives of WDB, GSL, the Association, and officials
of the Colombo Municipal Corporation and Towns South regarding the respon-
sibility for water distribution within the project area. Although it was
considered preferable for WDB to assume this reponsibility, the local authori--
ties strongly resisted an encroachment on their control over municipal
services; accordingly, they retained control over water distribution and the
tax revenue allocated thereto. Since that time, local authority revenues,
which have remained relatively static, are proving increasingly inadequate
to meet the rising costs for water as well as all other municipal services.
Prior to the appraisal of the proposed project, the possibility of a property
tax surcharge within the project area was explored; however, it was rejected
by GSL as politically untimely.
4.13      Under the first project, a tariff study was conducted to develop a
system of retail charges based on consumption aimed at encouraging conserva-
tion and making maximum use of a limited base for cross-subsidization while
falling within reasonable limits of affordability for each consumer category
(paragraphs 4.20, 5.13 and 5.14). With the completion of this study, the
emergence of a tariff acceptable to GSL, and the need for an aggressive
billing and collection activity, the question has recurred as to which
authority is best suited to undertake the responsibility for retailing. The
successful implementation of appropriate tariffs is essential to assure
viability of all organizations participating within the sector.
4.14      During appraisal, GSL provided strong indications that WDB would
soon become the water retailer within Colombo; however, GSL did not give
similar indications regarding retailing in Towns South. For WDB to serve as
retailer in Colombo while local authorities retain that responsibility in the
remainder of the project area has serious drawbacks. Such an arrangement
increases the risk that the establishment of billing and collection procedures
1/   Including distribution of water to consumers and billing and collection
of related revenues.



- 28 -
will become haphazard. Agencies failing to take this responsibility seriously
are likely to affect adversely the parallel efforts of other agencies within
the project areas. At negotiations, GSL gave assurances that WDB will become
the retailer of water and sewerage services for Colombo and Towns South with
the transfer of all responsibilities and related assets being completed not
later than December 31, 1981. Additionally, at negotiations, GSL has under-
taken to obtain the formal acceptance of the project area's local authorities
to this expansion of WDB's responsibilities not later than December 31,
1980.
4.15      WDB brought to negotiations an acceptable program defining the
procedures for realizing revenues to be followed during the interim period,
when some connections are metere(d and others are not. This program will serve
as the basis for establishing consumer billing and collections. At negotia-
tions, GSL undertook to implement this program promptly.
4.16      As soon as WDB assumes responsibility for retailing within the
project area, it must rapidly become effective at billing and collecting
consumer revenues. This is particularly true in view of WDB's substantial
cash requirement resulting from its highly ambitious capital expansion program.
Steps are already in process to organize and systematize WDB's revenue depart-
ment (paragraph 2.13). At negotiations, WDB undertook that in each year after
1983 it will realize collections of consumer, governmental and local authority
accounts receivable at a rate exceeding 90% of that year's billed revenues.
Tariffs
4.17      The majority of Sri Lanka's urban development has taken place
within the project area. This area contains much of the nation's industry,
a higher level of per capita income and, as a result, an identifiable base
for cross-subsidization of poor consumers. Outside the project area, the
larger urban centers operate their own water supply systems while WDB sells
water primarily to towns, villages and rural communities. Because the nature
of these activities is so different from those within the project area and
because the Association is not involved in those activities outside the
project area, the discussion of tariffs and of agreements relating thereto
will focus on the project area.
4.18      Since appraisal of the first project, WDB has realized its project
area revenues by billing each local authority for the estimated volume of
water supplied thereto priced at a bulk rate. This bulk rate, which was
set at Rs 0.60 per thousand Imperial gallons (unit) 1/ at about the time of
appraisal of the first project, has undergone annual increases since 1978
to Rs 0.88 per unit, effective January 1, 1978; Rs 1.13 per unit, effective
January 1, 1979; and Rs 1.35 per unit, effective January 1, 1980.
1/   Although Sri Lanka officially uses the metric system, all past tariffs
have been based on thousand Imperial gallon units. For future tariffs,
GSL has approved a rate structure based on the same unit. This rate
structure is not strictly convertible to metric and GSL as not specified
a metric analogue; therefore, in this discussion, rates are expressed in
thousand Imperial gallon units.



- 29 -
4.19      Within the project area, the local authorities have sought to cover
their costs for distribution, debt service and bulk water charges from the
property tax. Each year, property owners within Colombo are required to pay a
tax equal to 30% of rateable property values; the property tax in Towns South
is set at 20% of rateable values. In the past, 30% of the total property tax
has been allocated to water supply. By late 1978, several among the Towns
South were unable to meet their water costs from these allocations; subse-
quently, it was decided that Towns South would double their allocation to
water supply and GSL would assist those local authorities in meeting the cost
of other municipal services. While this adjustment proved reasonably satis-
factory in 1978 and 1979, GSL's own projections for 1980 and beyond indicate
that the local authorities will require additional revenues to cover their
costs for water. GSL decided to increase local authority revenues by setting
charges for water distributed to commercial and industrial consumers (most of
whom are already metered) at Rs 12.44 per unit and raising the GSL payment for
estimated consumption of water supplied through public taps to Rs 12.44 per
unit. The Association agreed during supervision of the first project that
this approach is acceptable until a consumption-based domestic tariff replaces
the property tax allocation.
4.20      Under the first project (Credit 709-CE), GSL agreed to implement
the recommendations of the tariff study (paragraph 4.13) and has indicated
its intention to implement the recommended tariff (Annex 16), with some
modifications acceptable to the Association, in tandem with implementation of
the metering program. The study computed an average incremental cost of water
at Rs 12.44 per unit which serves as the basis for setting rates applicable to
each category of consumer. In effect, by implementing the tariff described
below, GSL is accepting the principle of marginal cost pricing:
(a) Most commercial and industrial consumers are metered and
will pay Rs 12.44 per unit of water. This rate has been
introduced for collection by the project area's local
authorities. The authorities shall continue accruing
these revenues until they revert to WDB (paragraph 4.15).
(b) Water supplied through public taps will be metered and GSL
will reimburse local authorities at a price of Rs 12.44 per
unit. Until the metering of public taps is completed, GSL
intends to accept and pay bills based on estimated con-
sumption. This rate has been introduced for collection
by the project area's local authorities. The authorities
shall continue accruing these revenues until GSL remits
them directly to WDB (paragraph 4.15).
(c) Domestic consumers will pay for water according to
a three block rate structure. The lowest block is
designed to provide households with their most basic
needs at nominal cost. The second block is intended
to provide households with an additional equivalent
amount at a rate somewhat above the effective rate
being estimated under the property tax. All addi-
tional water consumption is to be priced at marginal
cost. In order to minimize consumer resistance to



- 30 -
the principles of metering and direct tariffs, GSL
will increase the charges per block to full rate
over a five-year period in accordance with the fol-
lowing table:
Table 4:1 STAGING OF THE DOMESTIC METERED RATE 1981-1987
1981   1982   1983   1984    1985   1986   1987
Quantity/Month       - --Rate - Rs/1,000 Ig--------------
First 2,500 Ig       0.50   1.00   1.50   2.00    2.50   2.50   2.50
Second 2,500 Ig      3.00   3.50   4.00   4.50    5.00   5.00   5.00
All additional       6.50   8.00   9.50  11.00   12.44  12.44  12.44
Furthermore, GSL plans either to excuse consumers paying
metered charges from thie 30% of the property tax tradi-
tionally allocated to water supply or provide each metered
consumer with a free allowance calibrated to offset that
property taxation. The decision is still pending; however,
it is expected that GSL will consult with the Association
prior to announcing the chosen option.
(d)  In accordance with WDB's program for making the transition
to retailing of water, domestic consumers in districts which
are not fully metered will continue paying for water through
an allocation from their property tax payments. The local
authorities will collect the total property tax from each
household and WDB will bill the local authorities for its
share of these revenues.
4.21      The aforementioned tariff is based on marginal cost pricing.  Rates
were computed based on constant prices, which are subject to increases based
on inflation; yet, the tariff accepted by GSL contains no provision for infla-
tionary adjustments. Considering Sri Lanka's current high inflation rate, the
tariff risks pre-implementation obsolence unless such adjustments are made.
At appraisal, GSL and WDB were advised that any agreement regarding financial
targets would be based on the assumption of periodic inflationary increases in
the tariff.
4.22      In the foreseeable future, a charge for sewerage in addition to the
newly introduced metered water tariff would be politically impractical, likely
to discourage reasonable use of the service, and exceed most consumers'
ability to pay (paragraphs 5.13 and 5.14). Moreover, both the consumer and the
community at large will benefit from sewerage; thus there is an argument for
significant recovery of costs from general government revenues. At appraisal,
WDB and GSL were advised that the financial targets which would apply to the
proposed project would only be attainable if WDB receives sewerage revenues
(Annex 6).
4.23      At negotiations, GSL and WDB agreed to a system of sewerage charges
sufficient to provide sewerage revenues equal to about 70% of water revenues,
as follows:



-31 -
(a)  until 1984, local authorities which have sewerage services
will pay an assessment equalling 40% of the required
sewerage revenue with GSL paying the remaining 60% directly
to WDB; and
(b)  as of 1984, in addition to the assessments payable by local
authorities, GSL and WDB will introduce a system of user
charges for sewerage which will most likely include the
following:
(i) domestic sewerage charges such that all connected
households would pay a percentage surcharge of
their consumption based water bill; the percentage
would vary with rateable property value to avoid the
possibility of disproportionate charges against lower
income property owners (paragraph 5.13);
(ii) commercial and industrial users would pay sewerage
charges levied as a surcharge on water charges for
consumption exceeding a predetermined level, thus
avoiding disproportionate charges against small
businesses (paragraph 5.14); and
(iii) a requirement that GSL, WDB and the Association will
agree to an exact formula for setting the levels of
user sewerage charges not later than December 31,
1983.
Similarly, as with the pre-1984 interim system, GSL will pay
the remaining required sewerage revenues to WDB.
4.24      In light of the foregoing discussion, at negotiations WDB and GSL
agreed to generate revenues in the project area at a level sufficient to cover
operating costs including depreciation of revalued fixed assets and, beginning
in 1982, provide an annual rate of return on the project area's revalued net
fixed assets in operation exceeding 8%. This target should enable WDB to make
an annual contribution from internally generated cash of 24% of the project
area's capital expansion program during the project construction period
(1980-84). On a consolidated basis, internal cash generation is expected to
finance about 9% of WDB's very ambitious construction program (Tables 4.2 and
4.3).
Financing Plan
4.25      WDB's financing plan for the project area for the period 1980-84
is summarized in Table 4.2 (detailed in Annexes 8 and 10).

is summarized in Table 4.3 (detailed in Annexes 12 and 14).
4.26      The financing plans presented in Tables 4.2 and 4.3 were compiled
at appraisal based on information obtained from WDB. WDB acknowledged that,
in the absence of a sector development plan, most of its capital expansion
program resulted from informal GSL decisions. WDB and GSL have recently
examined the financial implications of these decisions. Since appraisal,
GSL's Ministry of Finance has furnished the Association with a draft of its
"Planned Investment Program 1980-84." This draft includes a total external
financing allocation for the period to the water supply and sewerage sector
of Rs 3,757 million (of which Rs 2,633 million will accrue from foreign
sources). WDB is revising its capital expansion program to reflect these
spending ceilings and will furnish those revisions to the Association as
soon as they become available. It is expected that these revisions will
mostly affect programs outside the project area.

Onlending Arrangements
4.27      At negotations, assurances were obtained that GSL will make arrange-
ments, satisfactory to the Association, to onlend the proceeds of the credit
to WDB for 24 years, including a five-year grace period on principal during
which interest is accrued, at a 9% interest rate; and to make available suf-
ficient funds to complete the project. The terms of onlending are similar 1/
to those applicable to the first project. It is expected that most of the
remaining project cost will be financed on a grant basis. GSL will bear the
foreign exchange risk. An acceptable onlending agreement is a condition of
effectiveness for the proposed Credit.
4.28      Though forecasts show that WDB would maintain a conservative debt/
equity ratio and would have no problem in meeting its debt service, it is
prudent to encourage WDB's caution in incuring debt. During negotiation
WDB's assurances were obtained that it will not incur any debt unless the
net revenues (before charging depreciation) for the prior twelve months shall
exceed 1.5 times the maximum debt service requirements for any succeeding
year on all debt of WDB including the debt being incurred.
1/   Under the first project, interest was waived during the grace period.
As a more mature organization, WDB can sustain interest accrual under
the proposed project.

Future Finances
4.29      Financial projections for the project area for the period 1980 to
1987 are displayed in Annexes 6-10. Projections for the same period for WDB's
consolidated operations are set out in Annexes 11-14. These projections
indicate that, after 1980, WDB's financial performance is increasingly
satisfactory.
4.30      The projected favorable financial performance results largely from
the project area's potential for revenue generation based on the tariff which
GSL has accepted, as modified by the sewerage revenues and periodic inflation-
ary increases. Should significant delays occur in implementation of the meter-
ing program, thereby delaying implementation of retailing, serious adverse
effects on WDB's financial performance will result. If metering and retailing
do occur on schedule, WDB will experience liquidity difficulites until 1983;
however, accelerated integration into WDB's retail system of commercial,
industrial and public tap revenues would offset these liquidity problems.
4.31      WDB's capital expansion program outside the project area is ex-
tremely ambitious; however, it is subject to review to assure conformity with
GSL's "Public Investment Program 1980-84." Most likely, the review will yield
a drastically reduced program. If not, several related problems will require
continuing attention during the period of project implementation. These
include (a) whether WDB has sufficient manpower to control a vastly increased
scope of operation; (b) whether GSL has sufficient financial resources to fund
such an ambitious program; and (c) whether WDB and GSL together have the
planning capability to effectively marshall the resources available. In the
unlikely event that these problems arise, they should not seriously affect
either completion of the proposed project or WDB's institutional development
within the project area because of the safeguards provided by the agreements
reached at negotiations.
4.32      Indicators which will assist in monitoring WDB's performance are
set out in Annex 17. However, to assist in monitoring performance WDB dev-
eloped, and presented at negotiations acceptable reporting procedures. WDB
undertook to use these procedures to forward information (some items annually
and other items quarterly) to the Association for review and comment.
V. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL JUSTIFICATION
5.01      The Colombo area and Towns South face serious threats to health
and economic vitality because of the increasing inadequacy of water supplies
and waste disposal. The Colombo municipality has been served by public, piped
water supplies since the 1860s and by waterborne sewerage since about 1910.
Water supplies were extended to Towns South in the mid 1960s. These systems
are in poor repair and seriously inadequate. Water supplies at public taps
are now available only 2-4 hours a day and at irregular times. Middle and
upper income households maintain continuity of water supply by constructing
storage tanks. Irregular supplies impose significant hardships on low income
households. The quality of water is doubtful; treatment works are operating



- 35 -
beyond capacity and, in order to meet demand, untreated waters are being
pumped directly from river intakes to the bulk water supply. Problems of
availability and quality of water are being addressed by the first water
supply project (Credit 709-CE). However, these investments will be insuf-
ficient from about 1982 when a water deficit is again expected. Government is
introducing metered charges for water in order to encourage conservation. The
sewerage system is severely overloaded and is overflowing in the city into
streets and roadside drains. Raw sewage is being dumped directly into the
Kelani river within the municipal limits of Colombo; outbreaks of cholera and
typhoid have occurred repeatedly over the past decade as a consequence.
5.02      The present project is intended to increase the supply of potable
water and to renovate and upgrade sewerage facilities. In addition, it seeks
to further strengthen the institutional capacity of WDB.
Population Served
5.03      The project will benefit the entire Colombo area, including neighbor-
hoods not directly served by the project, by reducing the threat of epidemics
of water and sanitation related diseases, improving economic opportunities and
reducing the vulnerability of the tourist industry to abrupt loss of markets
due to outbreaks of disease. A total of 1.5 million people (1979) will thus
benefit. The project will also allow 60,000 additional household water
connections to serve approximately 450,000 more people, and will double the
number of public taps -- from 2,220 in 1979 to 4,600 by 1991. About half of
the project's beneficiaries will be served by public taps. Per capita con-
sumption is expected to decrease from an average of 150 mld to 110 mld between
1979 and 1991 as tariffs curtail very high use by connected households.
Impact on Poverty Groups
5.04      A third of the households in the project area reported incomes in
1977 of less than Rs 600 (US$39) a month in a survey conducted by the Depart-
ment of Census and Statistics. Slightly less than half reported incomes
below Rs 800 (US$52) a month. It is expected that households will choose
to connect to the piped water system only if charges can be met from less
than 6% of family income; monthly charges exclusive of connection fees are
likely to be about Rs 47 (US$3) per household. Thus, about half will be
forced to rely upon free, public taps. The doubling of the number of public
taps, while maintaining the present ratio of population served to public taps,
will increase accessability and thereby reduce time spent walking to them.
The curtailment of consumption by connected households, as a result of meter-
ing, will result in greater reliability of supply. Until 1992 supplies are
expected to meet demand. As a consequence, the poor will enjoy continuous
supplies of water. Water obtained at public taps is financed from general
government revenues rather than through direct charges; thus one may view
public tap water as being a subsidy to the poor. Because low income house-
holds have been less able to compensate for defective water quality, through
boiling or other means of disinfection, and have not had the resources to
construct private storage for water, they will now receive greater incre-
mental benefits from improved supplies and water quality than will higher
income households.



- 36 -
Impact on Health
5.05      Sri Lanka enjoys exceptionally high levels of health among develop-
ing countries. Life expectancy, infant mortality and maternal mortality are
approaching the standards of the developed world. The major persistent threat
to health is water related disease. Gastro-enteric infections, soil borne
helminths and skin infections account for about 26% of hospital admissions
and about 16% of deaths in hospitals. Information on diseases seen in clinics
and health centers is not available, but it is probable that common water-
related diseases are presented more frequently at these facilities than at
hospitals. Minor gastro-enteric complaints probably do not routinely receive
medical attention but are likely to disable victims for one to four days per
episode. In 1973-76, an outbreak of cholera appeared in the project area.
Standards of hygiene and water use are high in Sri Lanka; it is likely that
greater availability of water will significantly affect the incidence of
water-related diseases.
Marginal Costs and Tariffs
5.06      Under the first water supply project, GSL agreed to implement a
program of metered charges for house connections and commercial and indus-
trial users of water. A tariff study was undertaken by consultants to estab-
lish a basis for tariff setting. Using information from the Master Plan and
work done in preparation of the first water supply project, the average in-
cremental cost (AIC) of water was calculated as being Rs 12.44 per thousand
Imperial gallons (Rs 2.75 per thousand liters). Government has agreed, in
principle, to the recommendations of the consultants that a tariff structure
be introduced whereby household connections would be billed at a rate of
Rs 2.50 per thousand Imperial gallons (Rs 0.55 per thousand liters) for the
first 2,500 gallons of consumption per month, Rs 5.00 per thousand Imperial
gallons (Rs 1.10 per thousand liters) for the second 2,500 gallons and AIC
for additional use. Other consumers would be charged the full AIC. Rates
would be revised each 2-3 years to reflect changes in the general price level.
Metered charges for water consumed at public taps are to be paid by GSL.
5.07      Sewerage is to be financed mostly from general government revenues
and local authority assessments. The revenues required for collecting and
disposing of sewage is estimated to be about 70% of the charges for water,
or Rs 8.70 per thousand Imperial gallons (Rs 1.90 per thousand liters) of
water consumed.
5.08      The mission has calculated the AIC in July 1980 prices for the
combined water supply and sewerage program to be financed by the project.
If social costs and projected demand are both discounted at a rate of 9% a
year, the AIC for the combined service is Rs 5.72 per thousand liters. If
benefits are discounted instead at 8%, AIC is Rs 4.95 a thousand liters.
These estimates substantially overstate the true AIC because sewerage serv-
ices will also be improved for consumers of pre-existing supplies of water.
Mission estimates may be contrasted with a combined incremental water and
sewerage cost of Rs 4.69 (in November 1979 prices) identified in the tariff
study. The mission concludes that the AIC estimated by consultants probably
somewhat overstates the true AIC.



- 37 -
5.09      The tariff structure adopted by government will yield an average
water tariff of approximately Rs 3.55 per thousand liters or roughly 75%
of AIC. Marginal water rates for all classes of users, except public tap
consumers, will equal AIC.
Economic Rate of Return
5.10      The economic rate of return has been estimated using both market
and border prices. An averaged conversion factor of 0.80 has been employed
in converting the prices of untraded commodities to border prices. Market
wage rates have been used throughout the analysis. All economic analyses
have been conducted in real terms.
5.11      The incremental revenues accruing as a result of investments under
the project have been taken as a first approximation of economic benefits.
Water has been valued at the tariffs accepted by government; sewerage has
been valued at 70% of the value of water. These attempts to quantify the
social benefits of the project neglect all externalities including improve-
ments in public health, greater land values in improved neighborhoods,
expanded economic opportunities and reduced risks to tourism resulting from
outbreaks of disease. Considering only the private benefits of water supply
and payments by government for sewerage, the project produces an economic
rate of return of about 5%. If connected households do not reduce their
consumption as predicted, in response to metered charges, consumption and
average tariffs would increase sharply over project estimates, from 1984
through 1991. Ignoring the effect of higher rates of use on average tariffs,
and considering only the greater volume, results in an increase in the rate of
return from about 5% to about 7%.
Affordability
5.12      About half of the population in the project area is expected to be
served by public taps. This group has incomes of less than Rs 800 a month
for a family of about 7.5 persons (Table 5.1). Expenditures for food alone
absorb more than two-thirds of the income of this group; food, housing,
fuel and clothing combined represent 85-90% of the expenditures. Thus,
households in the lower half of the income distribution are unlikely to be
able to afford to be connected to the public water supply. Moreover,-at
least 175,000 of this group live in temporary structures unsuited for interior
plumbing and, hence, could only connect if housing were also improved. Water-
borne sewerage is impractical for this group. While, in principle, a charge
might be levied for water obtained at public taps, the very modest ability
of the population to pay for water suggests that the rates that are charge-
able are likely to be too small to justify the cost of collection.

Census and Statistics, Colombo, 1977.
/b   Expenditures by households has been used as a proxy for average income
following the usual practice for establishing normal income from survey
data.
5.13      The half of the population that is expected to be served by house-
hold connections had incomes in 1977 exceeding Rs 800 a month per household
of about eight persons. About a third of this group had incomes of Rs 800
to 1,000 a month, while the remaining two-thirds (one-third of the total
population) reported an income of more than Rs 1,000 (an open-ended income
class in the consumer expenditure survey). From estimates of average income
from other sources, one may conclude that the average income for the upper
income group is Rs 1,900-2,000 per household. Food, housing, fuel and cloth-
ing represent about 70% of expenditures of this group, implying that some
discretionary income is available with which to pay for water and sewerage.
Government has accepted a proposal to charge connected households for water
at the following rates:
Quantity Per Month                    Rate Per 1,000 Ig
First 2,500 Ig                              Rs 2.50
Second 2,500 Ig                             Rs 5.00
All additional                              Rs 12.44
With this tariff in effect, persons in the group earning Rs 800-1,000 per
household and consuming the amount projected to be consumed per capita at
public taps would spend less than 1% of their incomes for water. However, if
this group purchased 160 lcd (35 Igcd), expenditures would exceed 8% of income.
A surcharge of 70% would be necessary to cover the revenue required for sewer-
age; the combined water and sewerage charge would exceed 13% of household
income. This represents a larger share of income than clothing and housing
expenditures combined. We conclude that such a combined tariff would very
severely limit house connections and water use, and hence, reduce health
benefits from the project. The group earning more than Rs 1,000 per month
per household would on average spend about 4% of income for water and 7% for
water and sewerage combined, at a per capita consumption of 160 lcd (35 Igcd).



- 39 -
If, as seems reasonable, this group were to maintain its present levels of
water consumption, charges would instead be 6% of income for water and about
11% for water and sewerage combined. We conclude that the proposed block
water tariff together with a 70% surcharge is not affordable except to the
highest income group, which represents less than 30% of the project population.
The potential for further cross-subsidization among household consumers is
negligible.
5.14      Potential for cross-subsidization from industrial and commercial
consumers is limited, first by the fact that this group is expected to
account for only a third of demand and second by the very modest scale of
the enterprises in the group. The largest consumer is a dairy that requires
about 0.73 mld (160,000 Ig per day) followed by a soft drink manufacturer
using about 0.45 mld (100,000 Ig per day). A small number of consumers
(estimated between 25 and 40 connections) require 0.09 to 0.45 mld (20,000
to 100,000 Ig per day). Colombo harbor uses 2.0 mld (450,000 Ig per day).
The hotel sector is expected to expand sharply over the next half decade
from 1,614 to 2,800 graded rooms; water consumption by hotels may be expected
to average about 1.5 mld (340,000 Ig per day) with a peak demand of 2.5 mld
(560,000 Ig per day) at full occupancy. The remaining industrial and com-
mercial consumers are small businesses. Commercial users average about 13 lcd
(3 Igcd) per worker; approximately 250,000 workers are employed in the project
area. The preponderance of small commercial and industrial consumers implies
that efforts to obtain cross-subsidies from this group would impose severe
hardships.
VI. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS

agreements under Credit 709-CE would be extended to the project:
(a)  WDB will retain and strengthen the project implementation
unit (paragraph 2.04).
(b)  WDB will adequately staff the accounting department
(paragraph 2.18).

(g) GSL will provide funds to complete the project and onlend
the Credit proceeds under satisfactory terms (paragraph 4.27).
(h)  WDB will limit debt to a specific level (paragraph 4.28).
6.02      During negotiations, agreements were reached with GSL and WDB on the
following major issues:
(a) WDB will retain consultants specializing in organization,
management and finance (paragraph 2.15) and, if necessary,
will retain a firm of accountants to supplement WDB's
finance and accounting staff (paragraph 2.18).
(b) GSL will appoint a management advisor (paragraph 2.16).
(c) WDB will appoint independent auditors (paragraph 2.21).
(d) GSL will provide grants or loans to property owners to
connect to the sewerage system (paragraph 3.10).
(e) WDB will install meters on existing property connections
at a rate of not less than 1,000 meters per month and
will install meters on new connections in metered areas
(paragraph 3.12).
(f) WDB will appoint consulting engineers to supervise construc-
tion of sewerage works under the project (paragraph 3.19).
(g) GSL will acquire land for the project (paragraph 3.29).
(h)  WDB will revalue its fixed assets annually (paragraph 4.11).
(i)  WDB will assume responsibility for all water and sewerage
services in the project area by December 31, 1981 (paragraph
4.14).
(j) A level of sewerage charges will be set to provide sewerage
revenues approximately equal to 70% of water revenues
(paragraph 4.23), and combined water and sewerage revenues
to provide an annual rate of return of 8% on revalued net
fixed assets (paragraph 4.24).
6.03      Subject to the conditions of effectiveness described in paragraphs
2.15, 3.19 and 4.27, the project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$30 million
on the standard terms.

THE SECOND SRI LANKA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Notes on Financial Projections
General Notes
1.        WDB follows a financial year coincident with the calendar year.
2.        WDB's accounts were sufficiently reconstructable so that it is possibtle
to estimate an annual project area balance sheet starting with December 31, 19793
(Annex 9) and a yearly balance sheet starting with December 31, 1978 (Annex 13)
for WDB's consolidated operations. Consequently, for the project area, the
income and expenditure statement and flow of funds statement (Annexes 7 and 8)
estimate 1979 results only, while the same two statements (Annexes 11 and 12)
for WDB's consolidated operations estimate results for 1978 as well as 1979.
These estimates of historical performance are not audited.
Income and Expenditure Statement Projections
Project Area Revenues
3.        It is assumed that WDB will serve as the retailing entity within the
project area. It is further assumed that WDB will begin realizing retail revenue
in 1981. Table 1 delineates the proportion of water consumers integrated into
its retail system per category.

It is further assumed that retail revenues will follow in accordance with the
tariff approved by GSL modified by a biannual inflationary increase. The rates
used are given as follows:

Consumption       6.50   8.00  13.32  15.31  21.33  21.33  25.81  25.81
Rates are shown for periods during which WDB may not collect retail revenues because
the local authorities may have the retailing responsibility on an interim basis;
consequently, it is assumed that the tariff is in effect from the onset of
retailing.
4.        The assumed bulk water revenues result from applying the bulk rate of
Rs 1.35 per 1000 Ig to estimated amounts of water being supplied to the distribu-
tion system net of consumption by metered connections. These amounts are payable
by local authorities. Although the tariff approved by GSL provides for increases
in the bulk rate, it is unlikely that the local authorities could meet such
increasing charges because of their decreased revenue potential if WDB serves as
the retailer of water within the project area.
5.        Sewerage revenue is projected at 70% of total project area water
revenue of which 40% is payable by local authorities and the remainder by GSL.
After 1984, a comDonent of sewerage revenue will accrue from user charges.
Non-Project Area Revenues
6.        Revenues outside the project area are projected to be sufficient so
that WDB will not be required to divert any cash receipts realized within the
project area to finance non-project area operations. These revenues may accrue
from local authorities or GSL directly; however, GSL indicated that any support
of non-project area expenses would be channelled through the local authorities.
Expenses
7.        All expenses were based on July 1980 unit costs, inflated in accordance
with the schedule shown in Table 3:

Table 3: INFLATION RATES AFFECTING INCOME AND EXPENDITURE STATEMENT

1986                         10%
1987                         10%
8.        Power, fuel and chemical unit consumption is based on information provi-
ded by WDB.
9.        Maintenance costs are estimated at 0.5% of the gross amount of revalued
fixed assets in service at the beginning of each year.
10.       The underlying data from which sewerage operating expenses were pro-
jected was obtained from the final design of the proposed project.
11.       Pre-operating expenses are incurred in 1984 and 1985 because
personnel needed to operate and maintain increments to the sewerage system are
hired and trained prior to placing those increments into operation.
12.       Administration expenditures are allocated equally between operating
expenses and work in progress. The overhead allocated to administration expendi-
tures were further apportioned between the project and non-project areas based
on data available from 1979. Overhead accruing from the sewerage system was
estimated based on data included in the proposed project's final design. All
administrative expenditures for future years are computed from the 1980 project:ed
base, inflated in accordance with Table 3.
13.       Bad debts were assumed at 10% of total project area water revenue.
14.       Depreciation was assumed to follow a straight line basis using a 40
year average life for all assets. Each year's depreciation is based on WDB's
revalued fixed asset position at the beginning of that year.
Flow of Funds
15.       It is assumed that funds from SFD would be made available to WDB on
terms similar to those of the IDA credit, described in paragraph 4.25.



ANNEX 15
- 60-                            Page 4 of 6
16.       In view of liquidity difficulties anticipated during 1980, 1981 and
1982, it is assumed that WDB will obtain a series of ways and means advances
(or overdrafts) to provide it with short term operating cash. It is further
assumed that, even during this period, WDB will contribute to its capital expan-
sion program within the project area from internally generated funds. Thus,
some of the proceeds of the ways and means advances will be applied to WDB's
own contribution to its capital expansion program.
17.       WDB's nationwide capital expansion program is based on information pro-
vided by WDB's engineering and projects staffs. The number and extent of projects
being considered under the large expansion program corresponds to decisions recom-
mended by GSL, most of which are based on political considerations. The value and
staging of individual projects within WDB's capital expansion program is consistent
with WDB's estimates; however, based on estimates provided by WDB's finance depart-
ment, cost overruns and delays in completion, each of about 30% are anticipated.
For parts of the program, sources of financing are already known. It is assumed
that the balance will be provided through a combination of internally generated
funds and assorted GSL loans and grants.
18.        In 1980 and 1981, internaL cash generation will cover a minor portion
of WDB's financing needs. Thereafter, internally generated funds will provide
an average contribution to WDB's project area capital expansion program of 25%
for the period 1980 - 1987, though this percentage may vary from year to year.
The balance of WDB's financing requirements will be provided by GSL on a 75%
grant, 25% loan basis.
19.       The additional funding needed for capital expansion outside the pro-
ject area is projected to be provided entirely from GSL on the same 75% grant,
25% loan basis. No further contribution from internally generated cash is
anticipated.
20.       All loans received from GSL will be of 35 years duration bearing
interest rates ranging from 8 1/2 to 11% with three years moratoria on interest
and principal.
21.       The Colombo sewerage system, recently transferred to WDB, has been
valued by GSL at Rs 125 million. GSL transferred cash or equivalent assets in
this amount to Colombo Municipal Corporation and has obtained an equivalent
value of additional equity in WDB. Though there has been no exchange of cash
by WDB in this transaction, it is shown in the flow of funds statement.
22.       Working capital requirements have been assumed as follows:



ANNEX 15

(a) Inventories are assumed at three month's operation and
maintenance requirements;
(b)  Required cash is assumed at one month's salaries and
overheads;
(c)  Accounts payable are assumed at 10% of chemicals, power
and fuel costs per year;
(d)  Other current liabilities are assumed at 15% of accounts
payable and estimated interest requirements for short term
borrowing; and
(e)  Accounts receivable are assumed as follows:
(i) Receivables due from local authorities are estimated at
25% of related annual revenues, resulting from the three
month billing cycle;
(ii) No receivables are estimated for payments due from GSL
since it will remit payment when billed; and
(iii) Collections for retail revenue will follow the
schedule in Table 4:

Balance Sheet
23.       Until fixed assets are incorporated into operating plant, all
expenditures related thereto are included in work in progress. Any expenses
relating to work in progress are never passed through the income statement.
24.       The balance sheet includes the provision for an annual revaluation
of fixed assets in operation based on the general inflation rates given in
Table 3.
25.       Due to WDB's inability to identify or reconcile certain suspense
accounts related to work in progress outside the project area, the consolidated
balance sheet contains the following two items:
(a) Rs 24 million adjustment reserve, which was combined with
retained earnings, beginning in 1979 and in effect each year
thereafter; and
(b) Other current assets in the amount of Rs 29 million in 1979
and Rs 38 million in 1980 and thereafter.
26.       Certain grants in aid which are expected from foreign sources will be
provided as grants to GSL and are accounted for as GSL equity in WDB's statements.
