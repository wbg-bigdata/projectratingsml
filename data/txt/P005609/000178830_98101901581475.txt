SUMMARY
i.       This report brings up-to-date the situation and prospects of
SNI which were described in detail two years ago in Report DB-53a,
November 10, 1969.
ii.      SNI's operations, which are mainly in the private sector,
have grolwn considerably since 1968; loan approvals in 1970 were about
twice 1968 approvals.  This trend is likely to continue.  SNI's share
of total investment in the economy has increased from less than 1% in
1966 to nearly 3% in 1970; SNI is contributing at present about 12%
of total industrial and hotel investment in Tunisia.
iii.     Although there has been some deterioration in SNI's project
work in the past two years, as a result of loss of senior staff, and a
consequent increase in arrears, SNI's financial position continues to be
sound. The increase in arrears caused SNI's auditors to qualify their
opinion on SNI's 1970 accounts. However, SNI has ample provisions,
and the risk of losses is not such as to imperil SNI's financial position;
SNI is creditworthy.
iv.      In March 1974 Mr. Habib Bourguiba Jr. became President of
SNI, replacing Mr. Moncef Belkhodja. Mr. Bourguiba has started to play
a useful role in SNI. He has shoiwn great understanding of SNI's problems
and set in motion steps to improve SNI's capabilities. Mr. Bourguiba
appointed a new Deputy Director General, who has experience in commercial
banking and hotel development, to carry out day-to-day management tasks.
In addition, SNI has adopted a plan to carry out organizational improve-
ments and to strengthen SNI's technical expertise in appraisal techniques.
It is working, in consultation with the Bank, on developing suitable
methods for improving economic analysis of projects.
v.       SNI has good business prospects.  Its business forecast, based
on these prospects, implies an increase of annual commitments from D 4.4
million in 1970 to D 8.5 million in 1976. The most recent Bank loan is
expected to be fully committed in January 1972, and SNI needs additional
funds to maintain its operations. SNI is attempting to diversify its
resources. The proposed fourth Bank loan of $10 million, together with
the resources which SNI expects to obtain from other sources, should
enable SNI to carry its estimated financing program through the end of
1972. In mid-1972, the Bank will review progress made in improving SNI's
organization, prior to considering further lending.



vi.      The proposed  loan should be made on the same terms and con-
ditions as recent Bank loans to development finance companies, including
the standard commitment charge. The free limit above which Bank approval
of a project is required, should be maintained at $200,000. The aggre-
gate free limit should be $2.5 million. The debt limit as defined in
the previous loan agreement should be retained. The financing of public
sector enterprises should not exceed 25% of the amount of the proposed
loan.



APPRAISAL OF
SOCIETE NATIONALE D'INVESTISSEMENT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Societe Nationale d'Investissement (SNI), established in 1959
and reorganized in 1965 with the assistance of the Bank Group, has so
far received three loans from the Bank totaling $25 million. The most
recent loan, signed on December 24, 1969, amounted to $10 million; of
this amount, $9.4 million have already been authorized for withdrawal.
It is expected that the balance of the loan will be fully committed in
the next few weeks. SNI therefore needs fresh capital soon. This
report appraises SNI for a new loan of $10 million.
II.  SNI'S ROLE IN THE ECONOMY
Background
2.01      Industrial Development.  Tunisian industrial policies during the
1960's favored the development of large state-owned enterprises, primarily
for capital intensive projects in import substitution products such as steel,
refined oil, vehicles, tools and appliances, and secondarily, in upgrading
natural resources like phosphate rock and other mineral ores. Since 1960,
there has been little foreign investment, the Government' s participation
has been dominant and the private sector has accounted for less than one
sixth of total investment in manufacturing and mining. The results of these
policies have been disappointing: (i) cumulative gross fixed investment in
mining and manufacturing totaling D 192 million from 1960 to 1970, contrib-
uted only D 39 million in increased value added during the period 1/,
(ii) the contribution of manufacturing to GNP increased only from 11.4% in
1960 to 13% in 1970, and (iii) several public enterprises were not well
conceived and, despite heavy tariff protection, very unprofitable, posing a
burden for the Government's budget.
2.02      The private sector's industrial activities are generally small-
scale and concentrated in mechanical industries, wood, paper and printing,
food processing and more recently textiles. While the agreement of associa-
tion with the EEC, effective since September 1, 1969, provides for free entry
of 90% of Tunisia's industrial products into the EEC, there are now very few
private sector projects which are export oriented. There has been little
incentive for Tunisian entrepreneurs to invest in industrial projects catering
to exports.
1/   An unusually high capital/output ratio in comparison with most other
countries.



- 2 -
2.03      Development of Tourism.  Over the past ten years, Tunisia has
fostered a rapidly growing tourist industry with substantial and rising
benefit to the economy. In the early years of tourism development, the
Government participated directly in hotel construction through a public
corporation, Societe Hoteliere Tunisienne de Tourisme (SHTT), which erected
a chain of luxury and first-class hotels. During the past six years, how-
ever, the Government has stepped aside and encouraged domestic and foreign
private investments in hotel construction through tax incentives, interest
rebates, subsidization of infrastructure work related to hotels, and pro-
vision of promotional and planning services. Annex 1 shows the impressive
achievements by the Tunisian tourism sector from 1963 to 1970. During this
period, the number of available beds increased from 5,743 to 37,185, the
number of visitor bed nights by over 33% annually, and gross foreign ex-
change receipts from D 3.7 million to D 29 million; tourism became the
leading foreign exchange earning sector for Tunisia. Preliminary statistics
indicate that 1971 should be a record year with an increase in tourist
arrivals of over 30% and of bed nights of about 50%.
Recent Economic Developments
2.04      An analysis of the present economic situation in Tunisia appeared
in the report "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Tunisia", which
was distributed to the Executive Directors under R71-210, dated August 25,
1971.
2.05      Tunisia's economy has recovered slowly from the floods in the
Fall of 1969. The increase in GDP in 1970 was only 3.6%, much lower
than forecast. Agricultural output was about the same as in 1969 and
industrial production was marginally higher; food processing industries were
affected by low agricultural production and construction materials by a
sudden discontinuation of exports to Libya. Tourism was severely affected
by the floods, by several cases of typhus (1969) and cholera (1970) in the
country and by the bankruptcy of two Swedish travel agencies, on which a
number of Tunisian hotels were depending for a large share of their occupan-
cy. While in 1970 the number of hotel beds available increased by 15% (see
Annex 1), tourist bed-nights increased by only 11% (against 25% forecast).
Although some well established hotels were able to operate profitably, most
hotels which opened in 1969 and 1970 experienced difficulties.
2.06      Overal4 gross fixed capital formation remained at high levels,
amounting to D 145 million, or 23% of GNP. Tourism and manufacturing
accounted for D 30 million of investments. In fact, in 1970 investment
in manufacturing decreased by 10%: the main subsectors affected were con-
struction materials, food processing and textiles, while investment in chem-
icals doubled as a result of the construction of a large phosphoric acid
plant. Annex 2 shows the subsectoral distribution of investment in manufac-
turing for 1968-1970 and an estimate for 1971.



2.07       Eonomic growth accelerated substantially in 1971 and GDP is
likely to increase by about 8 percent. Due to good weather conditions,
agricultural crops were excellent and this allowed a recovery in industrial
food processing. Tourism expanded by about 33 percent. The Tunisian Govern-
ment anticipates a continuation of the rapid growth in 1972.
SNI as a Source of Financing
2.08      SNI has been active in the financing of two sectors, manufactur-
ing and tourism. It is the main source of medium and long-term financing
for private industry in Tunisia. It has played a major role in the devel-
opment of the tourism sector, where it has also been the main source of
long-term funds in the country. SNI's role in financing tourism is now
shared with Compagnie Financiere et Touristique (COFITOUR), a tourir±--de--'
velopment finance company established in 1969 and sponsored by'IFC and S4          -
which subscribed respectively 20% and 16.5% of COFITOUR's share capital.
2.09      The important contribution of SNI to overall and to private in-
vestment in Tunisia in the manufacturing and tourism sectors is summarized

2.10      While total manufacturing investment has increased on the average
at less than 5% annually since 1966, SNI's disbursements for manufacturing
projects have increased by about 30% every year; thus SNI's share of total
industrial investment in the country has increased from 5% in 1966 to 12%

in 1970, reflecting the growing role SNI was able to assume since its reor-
ganization in 1965. SNI's growing share of business also reflects the
government controls on suppliers' credits as part of balance of payments
stabilization measures recommenced by the IMF in 1968.  SNI's contribution
to total private investment in industry has averaged 31% in the period
1966 - 1970. This is very high, particularly considering the competition
until 1969 from suppliers' credits and commercial banks at interest rates
lower than SNI's. For tourism, since 1968 SNI has financed about 13% of
total investment. This contribution could have been even higher if SNI
had not decided, in order to spread its risk, to keep its commitments for
tourism projects to less than 50% of its total commitments.
2.11      SNI's financial assistance has been mainly in the form of loans
with terms between five and twelve years, and through equity investments.
SNI's long-term loans have contributed to improve the capital structure of
its borrowers, many of which without them would have had to obtain short-
term financing or unsuitable medium-term suppliers' credits; other projects
could not have moved forward without SNI's financial assistance. However,
the experience acquired in the past two or three years has shown that the
terms of SNI's loans, particularly for hotels, have not always been ade-
quate and have put an excessive burden on some borrowers. SNI has now
started, in appropriate cases, to increase the terms of its hotel loans
from 12 to 15 years, and grace periods from 2 to 3 years.
2.12      Since 1966, SNI's equity investments have been small compared
to SNI's role in lending, although equity investments have been up to the
maximum allowed under its Policy Statement which prudently limits the size
of SNI's equity portfolio to its net worth. The share capital increase
completed in January 1971 will allow a growth in SNI's equity invest-
ments. SNI has made, since 1966, 36 equity investments totaling D 2.3 mil-
lion, of which about D 1.3 million has been in the tourism sector where the
ministerial Investment Commission requires that at least 30% of the cost of
each project be financed with equity funds, and where the scarcity of equity
investors had constituted an important bottleneck for new investment. It is
estimated that at least seven hotels with an aggregate of over 2,000 beds
would not have been built if SNI had not taken equity in them.
SNI as a Mobilizer of Resources
2.13      SNI's Resources.  Annex 3 gives a breakdown of SNI's long-term
resources (net of repayments) on October 31, 1971. For the bu:lk of its re-
sources, SNI has been relying on the Swedish International Development
Authority (SIDA) and the Bank, which have lent US$9 and US$25 million respec-
tively since 1966; SNI has also obtained loans from Tunisian public sector
institutions and the Government. For its share capital SNI has reached a
large number of Tunisian private investors. When SNI increased its share
capital from D 1.5 million to D 3 million during the second part of 1970
(see Annex 4), SNI made a considerable effort to promote the sale of its
shares among about 80,000 Tunisian individuals whose original subscription
to SNI's share capital had been stimulated strongly by a savings scheme for
Government employees; SNI succeeded in 1970 in mobilizing D 242,000 from
many of these investors even with a 10% premium on the new shares. In this



- 5 -
process the number of Tunisian individual shareholders decreased to about
60,000. SNI has also been accepting short- and medium-term deposits which,
at the end of 1972, amounted to only D 2 million. This resource has not
been very significant to SNI because the interest it was able to pay (about
3.5%) is not sufficiently attractive to raise substantial amounts. A deci-
sion of the Government at the end of 1971 now enables SNI to pay about 4.5%,
which is 1% more than rates paid on similar deposits at commercial banks.
SNI therefore hopes in future to raise more significant amounts from deposits.
The average maturity of its time deposits will be about one year. Deposits
will be used to increase SNI's liquidity or to cover the early maturities
of its medium-term loans.
2.14      Catalytic Role.  Since 1966 SNI's aggregate approvals of loans and
equity investments totalling D 21.6 million have been associated with projects
with an estimated total cost of about D 58 million. Although not all these
projects would have failed to go forward without SNI, SNI's catalytic role in
their formation and in assuring the soundness of their financial structure
was important. Reflecting the low level of foreign investments in industry
and tourism in Tunisia, SNI's projects (except COFITOUR and a few hotel
projects) have involved little foreign investment.
2.15      Capital Market.  SNI has not contributed significantly to the
development of Tunisia's capital market.  It has bought and sold securi-
ties to private investors but its efforts in this have been constrained
by the lack of an organized trading market. Moreover SNI was somewhat re-
luctant to push its equity transactions until the end of 1970, because of an
important Convention with the Government which then expired. This Conven-
tion guaranteed SNI for five years the book value of its investments in its
portfolio as of December 31, 1965. It also specified that any premiums
obtained by SNI in its share sales before the end of 1970 would be surrendered
to the Government.
2.16      The Stock Exchange of Tunis started operating in June 1970.
Although the volume of transactions is still thin, 23 issues of Government
and other public sectors bonds and 17 stocks of private and public sector
companies are now quoted in the Stock Exchange. The existence of an organ-
ized market and the expiration of the 1965 Convention should enable SNI to
increase moderately the turnover of its equity portfolio and thus contribute
more effectively to the development of the capital market in Tunisia.
Characteristics of SNI's Investments
2.17      SNI's important share in financing most of Tunisia's private
manufacturing projects of medium and large size permits some general con-
clusions about the development of Tunisian private industry in the last
five years to be drawn from SNI's operations. Annex 5 gives the principal
characteristics of SNI's operations since the beginning and Annex 6 compares



-6-
the salient features of projects financed by SNI from the proceeds of the
Bank's three loans. The main conclusions, which are based on SNI's opera-
tions through the end of 1970, are the following:
2.18      Sectoral and Geographic Distribution.  Tourism has accounted for
the main share (41%) of SNI's activity. Construction materials account for
9% of total approvals; textiles for 7%; transport, food processing, mechani-
cal industries and wood, for 5% each; and other sectors, for the remaining 22%.
Given the fact that SNI is involved in most private industrial ventures in
Tunisia these percentages are in line with the sectoral distribution of in-
vestment in Tunisian private industry, except for the textile sector where
SNI's role has been small because of sizeable existing public sector capacity,
and competition from suppliers' credits. In view of Government's consideration
of export incentives to encourage private investment in the textile, leather
and shoe sector (for which the association agreement with the EEC improves
export possibilities for Tunisia), there should be increasing opportunities
for SNI in these labor intensive industries. Most of the industry supported
by SNI is in Tunis and Sfax, while hotel projects are primarily in the Ham-
mamet-Nabeul area and in DJerba.
2.19      Size.  The average size of SNI's loans has grown from D 96,000 in
1966 to D 112,000 in 1970 (for private industrial projects the average was
D 56,000 in 1970). Despite its increase in operations in the past four years
and despite scarcity of staff, SNI has tried to assist small industrial enter-
prises and has recently increased its processing of applications for loans to
such enterprises. Indeed, the importance of small-to-medium projects in the
Tunisian economy justifies SNI support. Five loans approved in 1970 were
below SNI's normal lower Policy Statement limit of D 15,000 and ten others
were for less than D 30,000.
2.20      Public and Private Ownership.  Until 1969 SNI would not finance
public sector enterprises. It then changed its policy by allowing assist-
ance to government-controlled enterprises up to 25% of its outstanding com-
mitments. This was desirable not only because of their need for capital
but also because SNI could then have a role in ensuring that they would be
soundly appraised and supervised. Since then, SNI has approved eight loans
for D 3.5 million for such enterprises; about 18% of its total business in
1969 and 1970. Most of these loans have been made for projects in the trans-
port (buses) and construction materials sectors.
2.21      Foreign Exchange Earnings and Savings.  A large part (41%) of
SNI's overall financing has been granted to the tourism sector, Tunisia's
leading foreign exchange earner in the past two years. In addition, nearly
20% (by amount) of SNI's loans to the manufacturing sector approved since
1965 have been for projects that are predominantly export-oriented, i.e.
projects that export over half of their production. Altogether, SNI's
operations in both tourism and manufacturing sectors show a favorable foreign
exchange earnings effect for Tunisia.



2.22      Employment.  A pressing issue facing the Government is unemploy-
ment. Although statistical evidence is insufficient, tentative estimates
indicate that total employment has risen little over the last three years,
while the percentage of male unemployment has remained close to 14% of the
labor force. Even after taking account of some 13,000 Tunisian workers
going abroad every year, Tunisia has to create nearly 50,000 new jobs annually.
Some will be found in tourism and in small industry, but a sizable gap will
remain. The Government is therefore giving more attention to labor intensive
activities. SNI estimates that its industrial projects approved between
1966 and 1970 should have added about 4,000 new jobs at a cost of about
$ 12,000 per new job. As to hotels, the generally observed ratio in the
Mediterranean of one job per two beds also applies in Tunisia. In light
of SNI's association with the creation of over 10,000 beds, it would follow
that 5,000 new jobs have been added by SNI's hotel projects at a cost of
about $ 10,000 per new job. Given the magnitude of Tunisia's unemployment
problem, however, jobs created by SNI's projects play only a minor part in
dealing with the problem. It is important that SNI place more emphasis
on the employment effect of its projects.
III. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS OF SNI
Shareholders
3.01      Annex 4 shows the ownership distribution of SNI's share capital
before and after the completion of the share capital increase on January 29,
1971. (Ownership has remained practically unchanged since that date.) The
shareholdings of Tunisian private institutions and individual investors,
which amounted to over 80,000 persons, have decreased from 56% to 42.5%;
this decrease has been partially offset by an increase in holdings by public
sector institutions from 16 to 24% of SNI's share capital. However, 2% of
SNI's shares held by Government-owned banks have been set aside in a syndi-
cate to offer potential foreign investors the possibility to join eventually
SNI's shareholders. Foreign institutions, excluding IFC, own now 13.3% of
the total as compared with 8% before, due to the increase in ownership in
SNI by Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique from 1% to 6%. IFC has
maintained its 20% share in SNI.
Board and Executive Committee
3.02      Annex 7 lists the members of SNI's Board and Executive Committee
as of June 12, 1971, the date of SNI's last General Assembly. Mr. Habib
Bourguiba, Jr., formerly Ambassador and Minister of Foreign Affairs, was
elected President Director General on March 8, 1971, replacing Mr. Moncef
Belkhodja, who continues with SNI as Director with special executive powers
("Administrateur delegu&"). IFC is represented on SNI's Board. SNI's
Board meets three or four times a year and reviews general policy matters.
All loans or investments of more than D 200,000 must be approved by the
Board. Discussions at Board Meetings appear frank and effective, but in the



-8-
past year or so, preparation for these meetings has not been adequate and
often Board members did not receive documents for the meetings early enough
to permit adequate study.
3.03      SNI's Executive Committee has been meeting five or six times a
year. It considers applications for loans and equity investments not exceed-
ing D 200,000 to any single enterprise.
Management and Organization
3.04      Mr. Moncef Belkhodja was SNI's President Director General from Jan-
uary 24, 1969 until March 8, 1971. When Mr. Belkhodja took charge of SNI,
he was assisted by a capable cadre of senior staff.
3.05      The management, organization and the staff strength of SNI began
to weaken in mid-1969, with the departure of several senior officers. Simul-
taneously, SNI's operations and portfolio were growing considerably. These
developments affected adversely the quality of project appraisal and follow-
up work, as well as SNI's loan portfolio.
3.06      Mr. Habib Bourguiba, Jr., has shown quick understanding of SNI's
problems and has set in motion steps to improve SNI's capabilities. Mr.
Bourguiba appointed Mr. Mokhtar Fakhfakh, formerly President of a state-
owned hotel company and more recently of a commercial bank as SNI's Deputy
General Manager. In addition, Mr. Belkhodja has decided to remain, for the
time being on SNI's staff; and Mr. Bourguiba has retained SNI's French tech-
nical advisor who has been with the company since 1964. In recent months,
when there were losses among SNI's experienced staff, the technical advisor
performed a substantial service in assuring a minimum degree of coordination
in the institution. SNI's professional staff has increased from 18 at the
end of 1969 to 27 at present, quite a number of them still needing experience.
3.07      Annex 8 is SNI's organization chart to become effective in January
1972 and designed to remedy earlier short-comings. It will be introduced,
together with other organizational improvements which are discussed below.
3.08      Project Appraisal.  Due to the loss of key staff noted above, the
quality of SNI's appraisals deteriorated in 1970-71. Technical and marketing
evaluations in particular were weak and not backed by adequate examination.
The economic merits of projects were often not well discussed and the Bank
had to pose supplemental questions to SNI on such matters when reviewing sub-
projects.
3.09      SNI engaged early in 1971 and an International Executive Service
Corps consultant to advise it on remedies. With respect to project
appraisal, and based on the comments by the consultant and Bank staff,
SNI has started to carry out a reorganization (to become effective in
January 1972) to improve its project appraisal work as well as to
develop its promotional capability.   The Appraisal Department will



- 9 -
be reorganized to include two divisions: one for financial and economic
appraisal and the other for technical evaluation. This Department will be
headed by the experienced man who previously was an advisor to the manage-
ment of SNI on technical matters. In addition, three engineers have recently
been recruited to form the basis for the engineering group. With respect to
the finance division a new man has been appointed to head the unit and three
new financial analysts have been recruited to strengthen the work of this
unit. SNI has also adopted more refined methods for establishing rates of
return for project selection purposes. It will subject projects to a mini-
mum financial rate of return test of 10%. Moreover, it is consulting with
the Bank on the development of methodology to calculate the effective rate
of protection on its industrial projects; and, in cases where taxes and sub-
sidies are significant, SNI will compute internal economic rates of return.
The Bank will continue to advise SNI on the implementation of more refined
financial and economic analysis in its project appraisal work.
3.10      Investment and Project Supervision.  Steps to improve follow-up
were discussed during negotiations and as a result SNI will create a sepa-
rate division to focus exclusively on follow-up activities. Four new staff
have been assigned exclusively to follow-up in order to bring this aspect of
SNI's operations under control. SNI's follow-up of hotel projects should,
in particular, improve as SNI has agreed with COFITOUR to undertake joint
supervision of hotel projects under construction that are cofinanced by SNI
and COFITOUR.
3.11      These are the main elements of a more detailed reorganization pro-
gram which, on the whole, should provide SNI with the organization it needs
to carry out an expanded financing program effectively. It is clear that
SNI's President is fully behind the reorganization plan and is committed to
improve the quality of SNI's operations. Ile has been open to advice from
the Bank on all aspects of the reorganization. The Bank will closely watch
the progress made.
3.12      Accounting, Disbursement and Procurement.  SNI's accounting and
disbursement systems are adequate. As regards procurement, SNI urges its
borrowers to procure equipment from the most competitive sources and, at
least for large projects, SNI insists that its clients present quotations
from several firms of international reputation. This aspect of SNI's
operation is satisfactory.
Policies
3.13      SNI's Policy Statement is shown in Annex 9.  SNI's operations have
been generally conducted within the framework of these policies. In two
instances, investments have exceeded the Policy Statement's normal limit on
single commitments (15% of SNI's net worth, or D 0.7 million at present);
these were SNI's equity investment in COFITOUR (D 825,000) and a loan to
SNT, a public sector transport company (D 1.2 million).  Both were considered
as exceptions, based on special justification. SNI has also made several
exceptions to its normal lower lending limit of D 15,000.



- 10 -
3.14      SNI's policy limits its lending to tourism to a maximum of 50%
of all outstanding commitments, and lending to public enterprises to a
maximum of 25%. As of December 31, 1970, SNI's outstanding commitments
in tourism represented 47%, and to public enterprises 15%, of total com-
mitments. According to SNI's projections, exposure in tourism will decline
to less than 40% when all investments already approved by SNI are committed.
3.15      Interest rates charged by Tunisia's commercial banks range from
7 to 8% per annum for short and medium term credits. SNI's lending rate
is 9%. However, loans financed with SIDA credit, half of which must be
used for public sector enterprises, are priced at 8.5% per annum under the
terms of the SIDA credit agreement. In its interest rate policy, SNI is
influenced by competing rates of commercial banks, suppliers' credits and
Societe Tunisienne de Banque (STB). The latter has access to small lines
of credit from KfW and USAID, which it relends at 8% p.a. SNI has been
able to maintain a slightly higher interest rate for its loans without harm
to its volume of business because STB's loans are mainly for construction
and for public sector companies and because SNI's foreign exchange resources
are untied.
Relations with the Government, Commercial Banks and Other Institutions
3.16      SNI's relations with the Government are good, and the Government
has left SNI independent in its investment decisions. The Government has
honored its guarantee of SNI's portfolio under the Convention signed at the
end of 1965 (paragraph 2.15) and has bought from SNI its bad equity invest-
ments at their book value of D 430,000. Repayment was made by the Govern-
ment in 1971. The Government has expressed its satisfaction with SNI's
performance in the private sector and has welcomed SNI's occasional financ-
ing of public sector projects.
3.17      SNI has good relations with Tunisian commercial banks, most of
which participated in SNI's share capital increase. Relations with COFITOUR
are good, and coordination on appraisals of projects financed jointly is
beginning. SNI is building up its contact with the National Center of
Industrial Studies 1/. SNI plans to draw more on the Center, particularly
in sectoral studies, technical appraisal of complex and large industrial
projects, and for specialized training of SNI's staff. SNI's reputation
with the business community appears good, judging from the large share of
SNI in the financing of private industrial projects, the considerable amount
of repeat clients, and the sizable subscriptions of Tunisian private business
investors in SNI's share capital increase.

IV. OPERATIONS, PORTFOLIO AND FINANCIAL POSITION
Operations
4.01      SNI's annual loan approvals have increased from D 1.8 million (19
loans) in 1966, and an annual average of D 3.8 million (34 loans) in 1967-
69, to a record D 6.5 million (58 loans in 1970. Approvals at the end of
November 1971 were D 5.9 million and the project pipeline suggests that
overall 1971 approvals should reach the level of 1970. Commitments have
followed approvals with an average lag of eight months a relatively normal
lag in the difficult circumstances prevailing in 1969-1970. SNI's finan-
cial assistance has been mainly in the form of loans with terms between
5 and 12 years. The foreign exchange risk is with the Government. About
80% of SNI's loans have financed imports. Since its reorganization in
1965, SNI's has approved 32 equity investments totaling D 2 million, in-
cluding D 0.3 million in 1970. The most important single equity investment
was for D 830,000, SNI's subscription to COFITOUR, of which D 415,000 was
disbursed in 1969.
Evaluation of Loan and Equity Portfolio
4.02      Auditors' Views.  SNI's auditors, Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co.,
qualified SNI's 1969 accounts, questioning the adequacy of SNI's provisions
for doubtful loans. In 1970, SNI's delinquent accounts increased, and a
total of D 0.7 million in interest and principal was overdue as of December
31, 1970, nearly twice the amount reached a year before. In view of this
large amount, the auditors declined at first to express an opinion on SNI's
1970 accounts until, in September 1971, they could undertake a detailed re-
view of selected clients of SNI in arrears. The auditors subsequently ar-
rived at the opinion that SNI should write off D 16,000 of old accounts
receivable and SNI has agreed to do so out of 1971 income. Otherwise the
auditors concluded that SNI's accounts presented fairly SNI's financial
position, subject to the ultimate collectibility of two hotel loans, which
SNI on good evidence considers sound.
4.03      The problems experienced by SNI with its auditors during the last
two years result from a difficulty in Tunisia in obtaining annual statements
of borrowers in time for SNI's audit 1/.   By law, companies are not required
to issue such statements before June 30. During negotiations, however, an
understanding was reached with SNI to correct progressively the situation.
For that purpose, SNI has agreed to formulate immediately its new loan con-
tracts to require borrowers to provide SNI with provisional financial state-
ments within three months after the end of their fiscal year. For existing
customers, SNI will endeavor to obtain from them financial accounts within
the same three months period. SNI also plans to consult with its auditors,
before the next audit, on how best to proceed so as to minimize the diffi-
culties experienced in 1971.
1/   Loan Agreement between  SNI and the Bank requires that SNI's audit should
be completed each year before May 31.



- 12 -
4.04      Loan Portfolio.  On December 31, 1970, SNI's loan portfolio includ-
ed 101 loans for D 9.2 million of which 14 loans, 7 of which were hotel loans,
for D 1.5 million (or 16.3% of total loan portfolio) were in arrears of in-
terest and principal for more than three months. This is high. The actual
amounts in arrears amounted to D 750,000, about 8.3% of the loan portfolio.
In addition, due to unforeseen delays in project construction, loans for
D 1.64 million were rescheduled by SNI. The majority of loans resched-
uled are to hotel projects which are starting or about to start operations.
In 1971, there has been a change in the picture. About D 800,000 were over-
due in mid-August -- a figure which does not include about D 100,000 overdue
on December 13, 1970 and since rescheduled. Since August, however, SNI has
been very active in collecting overdues and the amounts in arrears were sub-
stantially reduced. At the end of October, while the total loan portfolio
had increased to D 11.3 million since the beginning of 1971, total overdues
amounted to D 571,000 (as compared with D 750,000 at the beginning of 1971).
4.05      In consequence of questions raised by the auditors and because
of the arrears situation, a case-by-case examination has been made of SNI's
portfolio. This shows that SNI's real risk is small. Only two loans are
likely to be partially lost, in an amount totalling D 40,000; and there is
a third where SNI's loss could amount to D 30,000. The rest of the portfolio
is likely to improve and no other losses are expected. Indeed, most of the
delinquent hotel loans are now doing well, and the value of the underlying
assets exceeds substantially the amount SNI has at risk. Security on SNI's
loan portfolio is also satisfactory. However, a peculiar situation has arlsen
which nominally affects the security on loans which SNI has made to 35 hotels.
The problem is a general one in Tunisia: some land on coastal areas is not
now registered as required and some hotels have been built on land which has
been expropriated. As a result, the mortgages SNI holds in 35 cases are not
valid. However, SNI's loans rank pari passu with all other debts of those
borrowers. Nevertheless, SNI is anxious to regularise the situation of the
mortgages affected by this peculiar situation and to get them validated as
rapidly as possible, despite the legal complexities involved. During nego-
tiations SNI worked out with the Government a satisfactory program for
assuring that most, if not all, of the affected loans would be secured by
valid mortgages by the end of 1972.
4.06      Equity Portfolio.  Annex 10 gives details of SNI's equity port-
folio as of December 31, 1970. The sale of unprofitable investments to the
Government under the 1965 Guarantee Convention (see paragraph 2.15) has im-
proved considerably the quality of SNI's equity portfolio, which now in-
cludes 28 investments for D 1.92 million at cost. Seven companies)account-
ing for 16% of SNI's equity portfolio,were unprofitable in 1970. Of these,
only two are experiencing serious difficulties; SNI's investments in them
amount only to D 26,100. The average dividend yield for SNI in 1970 has
been low (about 3%), as most of SNI's investments, including the one in
COFITOUR, have started operations only recently, and will take time to
generate an appreciable return.

4.07      SNI's equity portfolio includes quite a few investments on which
important capital gains could be expected if SNI were to sell them. Al-
though an evaluation of the potential for such gains is difficult given
Tunisia's thin market for securities, under present circumstances such poten-
tial gains should exceed the estimated losses on SNI's bad investments. There-
fore SNI has decided not to make provisions on its equity portfolio.
4.08      Summary Evaluation.  The provision of D 102,000 made by SNI seems
to be sufficient. SNI has reserves of D 1.2 million. SNI has now formulated
a provision policy according to which it plans to make provision on a case by
case basis in the light of recent financial information on its clients. More
emphasis on, and better, follow-up should also help.
Profitability and Financial Position
4.09      Annex 11 shows audited income statements from 1967 to 1970.  Ac-
cording to SNI's income statement for 1970, SNI's net profits for the year
were one third less than in 1969. While 1969 net profits were D 198,600
(13.2% on share capital and 7.6% on average equity), 1970 profits were only
D 135,400 (8.9% on share capital and 5.1% on equity) mainly because:
(a)  Administrative expenses increased by 33% (from D 125,000 to
D 168,200). Three factors were responsible: the cost of
last year's share capital increase, the hiring of several
staff members at the end of 1969, and the fact that the
President's salary, paid in 1969 by the Central Bank, was
paid in 1970 by SNI.
(b) SNI which was tax exempt in 1969 1/, will have to pay D 46,000
as income taxes on 1970 results.
Net profits over the first 10 months of 1971 reached D 131,000. SNI's pro-
jection for net profits of D 142,000 for the whole year 1971 is therefore
well supported.
4.10      Annex 12 shows SNI's balance sheets from 1967 to 1970.  SNI's
financial position at the end of 1970 is sound. At the end of October 1971,
SNI's long-term debt/equity ratio was about 2.4 and the debt/equity ratio
as defined in contracts with the Bank was 2   against a limit of 4  SNI's
liquidity position is strong, with a net working capital of over D 1.0 mil-
lion. Reserves and provisions computed at October 31, 1971 covered about
11% of total portfolio and were considerably higher than hardcore risks in
the portfolio. SNI's Board, on the basis of SNI's unaudited accounts, de-
cided in June 1971 to declare a 6% dividend on 1970 results (5% in 1969).
1/   SNI's tax exemption ended in 1968.  However, by law of December 31,
1962, 50% of SNI's equity investments approved and paid-in during
the year can be deducted from the taxable profits. SNI's investment
in COFITOUR in 1968 (D 414,500) was sufficient to exonerate SNI from
a tax liability in 1969.

V. OUTLOOK
Business Prospects
5.01      During the past five years, annual real economic growth has aver-
aged only about 3-1/2%. After the political and economic difficulties which
culminated in the change of Government in 1969 and the adoption of a new and
more liberal economic policy, Tunisia is now placing more emphasis on the
need to encourage private investment, including foreign investment, and to
foster exports. Near the end of 1970, the Prime Minister presented a re-
vised economic strategy emphasizing higher growth in output and exports to
be achieved mainly through a relaxation of government intervention, greater
reliance on private entrepreneurship and a rise in public savings. To
reach these goals, some trade liberalization and improved incentives have been
introduced and further measures are being contemplated by the Government.
Apart from mining and utilities, the Government does not wish to increase
the share of the public sector in industry and, in some cases, it plans to
disinvest in favor of the private sector.
5.02      Unless economic growth can be accelerated, particularly in agri-
culture, industrial projects for import substitution in Tunisia will face
a saturation in the local market. The size of the Tunisian market (5 mil-
lion) and per capita GDP of $210, indicate that new projects, to be viable,
will have to be increasingly export-oriented. The Government is now taking
steps for promoting industrial exports, taking advantage of Tunisia's favor-
able location, low-cost labor, some mineral resources, and Tunisia's agree-
ment with the EEC. The main possibilities lie in subcontracting in electri-
cal and mechanical industries, and labor intensive sectors such as textiles,
leather goods and shoe making. In October 1971, the Consultative Group for
Tunisia discussed the promotion of export oriented foreign investments and
the Tunisian authorities are now establishing contact with business organi-
zations abroad. The present flow of business to SNI indicates the possi-
bility of a steady growth of investments in the industrial sector of perhaps
5-6% per annum. It is reasonable for SNI to expect that it will maintain
its present share of the market if it continues to make progress in solving
the staff and organizational problems that developed over the last 2 years.
5.03      In tourism, the Government has undertaken a comprehensive study
of the needs and prospects for growth over the next 15 years (1971-85). It
adopted a relatively modest target of 1.5 million visitors in 1985 (as
against 410,000 in 1970), implying the annual construction of about 6,000
new beds so that by 1985 the number of available hotel beds in Tunisia will
be 125,000, a reasonable objective. This implies annual investment of D 14
million. The bulk of the program would be financed by the private sector.
With a planned average stay of 12 days per tourist, the average occupancy
rate (40%) of hotels under this target seems low; but the actual number of
visitors may well exceed 1.5 million in 1985, given Tunisia's strong attrac-
tion to European mass traffic.



- 15 -
Forescast of Operations
5.04      SNI has based its forecast of operations (1971-76) on a modest
growth of approvals in industry at about 4% per annum, and of hotel financ-
ing along the lines of the Government's plans. This would mean a higher
share for SNI's tourism investment than in the past - but given tourism
prospects, this is probable. This forecast growth appears attainable.
5.03      Annex 13 contains SNI's forecasts of operation through 1976.  To-
tal commitments in the 1971-1976 period are forecast at D 40 million. Con-
tractual commitmtents are projected at totals of D 5.2 and D 7.9 million in
1971 and 1972, respectively. This compares with D 4.4 million in 1970.
The relatively large increase in 1972 reflects SNI's large pipeline of pro-
jects already approved in 1970 and 1971 for which commitments were not made
due to administrative and legal delays.
Resources Needed
5.06      To meet forecast commitments of about D 40 million through 1976,
SNI had on November 31, 1971 only about D 2.5 million of uncommitted re-
sources as follows:
(D million)
Funds from increase in share capital
and self generated funds                   1.0
Uncommitted balance of
-  second SIDA credit                      0.8
-  third Bank loan                         0.7
2.5
5.07      SNI thus needs about D 37 million to finance commitments for the
next five years. Some of it will come from its internal cash generation but
the bulk will have to be borrowed. SNI intends to make efforts to diversify
its resources and hopes to obtain more dinar funds from deposits. SNI is
also discussing with the Government the possibility of obtaining bilateral
foreign credits in addition to those that it expects to receive from SIDA
and the Bank. Such efforts may yield some amounts, but they are not likely
to allow SNI to go forward without substantial support from SIDA and the
Bank.
5.08      The third Bank loan will probably be entirely committed in the next
few weeks. By that time, SNI should still have D 0.8 million available from
the second SIDA credit which SNI has already to a large extent earmarked for
projects. (About half of the SIDA loans will as in the past be used for import
financing, and the other half for local currency financing.)



- 16 -
5.09      Normally, the Bank would base its lending on a two-year time hori-
zon. Total commitments over the period from January 1971 through December
1973 will total about D 15.3 million.  Of this total, as shown in Annex 13,
D 11.4 million represent the import element. Funds available for commitments
at the beginning of the period are expected to be D 1.5 and 0.7 million in
local currency and foreign exchange respectively. The gap thus amounts to
D 2.4 for local expenditure and D 10.7 for imports. SNI hopes to cover this
gap by a third SIDA credit of D 4 million equivalent in 1972 (1/2 of which
would finance local expenditures), by cash generation (projected at D 0.6
million over the two-year period) and a fourth Bank loan. In the past,
about four-fifth of the resources needed to finance imports were financed
with Bank funds and one-fifth with SIDA funds. On that basis, and unless
SNI succeeds within the next two years to raise funds from new foreign
sources, SNI would need a Bank loan of about D 8.6 million ($16.3 million);
this would represent about 50% of SNI's overall commitments.
5.10      However, in view of the improvements in organization and procedure
now under way in SNI, a fourth Bank loan should cover SNI's commitments to
finance imports for only a year until December 1972. There will be a fresh
appraisal of SNI in the middle of 1972, when SNI's progress in reorganization
and performance can be assessed. A $10 million loan (D 5 million) would
approximately cover SNI's needs through 1972.
Financial Projections
5.11      Annexes 14 through 16 are SNI's 1971-75 projections of cash flow,
income statements and balance sheets, based on SNI's forecast of operations.
5.12      Two factors will have an important bearing on SNI's profits and
reserves. Starting in 1970, SNI has been subject to a tax of 46.5% on its
operating income. Secondly, the recent 100% share increase of SNI has led
SNI's management to project only a 5% dividend for the financial year 1971,
though SNI expects to be able to revert to a 6% dividend during the 5-year
period starting with the results of 1972. SNI results are thus expected to
evolve as follows:

Gross  Earnings           Net Profit After Tax
as % of Average                  as % of
Total  Assets        Share Capital  Average Equity
Actual:  1970 /1          6.05                   8.9             4.8
Est.:    1971 /2          7.23                   6.3             4.1
1972             7.67                  8.9             6.2
1973             8.06                 12.8             8.7
1974             8.20                 16.9            11.0
1975             8.21                 18.5            11.4

/1   Before share capital increase.
/2   After share capital increase.
If these results are realized, there is no reason why SNI should not pay a
dividend substantially higher than 6% in a few years.
5.13      Projected balance sheets through 1976 (Annex 16) show that total
assets are expected to more than double over the five-year period, from
D 17.6 million in 1971 to D 40.7 million in 1976. SNI's debt limit as
defined in the Bank's Loan Agreements will remain below the 4:1 agreed
limit until 1974. The coverage of SNI's portfolio by reserves over the
five-year period would remain at about 9%. This cushion should be suffi-
cient to meet normal risks in its portfolio.
5.14      Debt service coverage will be sufficient during the period 1971-
1976, particularly taking account of the revolving of SIDA loans whose
amortization schedule is fixed. Annual interest payments on SNI's borrowings
would remain at about 50% of SNI's annual income; the ratio of collections to
principal repayments by SNI will be growing from 1.2 in 1971 to 1.4 in 1975.
If SNI continues keeping in balance the maturities on its present debt and
the repayments on its lendings, this ratio, through the life of another Bank
loan, should not drop below 1 .2.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      Over the past two years, SNI has continued its important role in
the Tunisian economy as the leading source of term financing for private
sector industry and tourism. This has been so, even with the establishment
of COFITOUR, which is taking a growing share of local currency financing of
hotel investment.
6.02      While SNI has, in this period, been able to maintain an increasing
pace of business, its organization and management suffered as a result of
the departure of several experienced senior officers. Project appraisal and
supervision work were affected, and SNI's management became increasingly con-
scious that it had to reverse this trend and introduce needed improvements
expeditiously.  SNI    therefore sought advice and has worked
out a program to bring about important changes in organization and to attract
the staff needed to give support to these reforms. SNI has consulted the
Bank on the measures which, by their nature and the importance that SNI
attaches to them, should bring about soon a noticeable improvement in SNI's
operational performance.
6.03      Agreement, in principle, has been reached with the Bank on improv-
ing SNI's economic analysis of projects. Discussion will continue between
the Bank and SNI to refine methods. SNI is also working out arrangements
to obtain more readily information on its borrowers' financial position.
Furthermore, SNI is working, together with the Government, on validating
the mortgages which it has obtained on some of its loans; this matter is
expected to be resolved by the end of 1972.
6.04      After a period of difficulties, Tunisia's economic outlook has re-
cently improved. There is a reasonably favorable prospect for further growth
of industrial investment, in part stimulated by prospects of exporting to the
EEC. Prospects are better still for further tourism investments. Given
these prospects, and the place SNI has already carved out for itself in
these two important sectors, SNI should look to a growing business in the
next few years. To carry out the business it has forecast in the next five
years, SNI needs to raise about D 40 million. SNI is trying to diversify
its resources, but this effort will take some time to bear fruit in signi-
ficant amounts. Over the next two years, SNI will have to look principally
to SIDA and the Bank to help cover its resource gap in meeting SNI's esti-
mated import financing.
6.05      SNI business forecast is reasonable and SNI requires fresh re-
sources. SNI is creditworthy. It is about to embark on important actions
to improve its organization and the quality of its project work. The Bank
should examine the progress of SNI's reforms in mid-1972. In these circum-
stances, it would be prudent to lend to SNI $10 million, enough, together
with the resources expected from SIDA, to enable SNI to carry its estimated
import financing commitments until the end of 1972.



- 19 -
6.06      The proposed loan to SNI should be made on the same terms and
conditions as recent Bank loans to development finance companies, including
the standard commitment charge. The free limit above which Bank approval
of a project is required, should be maintained at $200,000 for private sec-
tor projects. However, there should be an aggregate free limit of $2.5 mil-
lion. The same debt limit as defined in the previous loan agreement should
also be retained. The financing of public sector enterprises should not
exceed 25% of the amount of the proposed loan.

SOCIETE NATIONALE D'INVESTISSEMENT
Statement of General Policies and Operations
Adopted by the Board of Directors on July 4, 1966 and
Amended on June 7, 1969
I.   Purpose of this Statement
These provisions define the general policies and the guiding
principles governing the operations of the Societe Nationale d'Investisse-
ment.
It is evident that the management may propose to the Board of
Directors of the SNI any necessary amendment which may be justified, in
the light of experience, in order that the SNI may perform its services
to the Tunisian economy with greater efficiency. In view of the impor-
tance of the subject matter to be discussed, the Board shall be given
ample time to study such proposals.
II. Purpose of the SNI
(1) The SNI, through the various forms of operation as specified
in III below, shall endeavor to stimulate the industrializa-
tion of the country and the development of tourism through
productive, economic and financially sound projects.
(2) The SNI shall also seek methods which may reactivate and
develop the capital market and, in particular, broaden the
securities market.
III. Investment Policy
(1) The SNI will assist the Tunisian economy by one of the
following methods, or a combination of several of them:
(a) medium- and long-term loans for the foreign
currency needs of a borrowing company;
(b) medium- and long-term loans for its local
currency needs;
(c) equity investments;
(d) underwriting syndicates for issue to the public of
shares of a borrowing company.
(2) The SNI shall concentrate its assistance in the industrial
and tourism sectors.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
(3) It will provide financial assistance mainly to private
enterprises or enterprises with a majority of private
shareholders. The following may be considered as pri-
vate enterprises or enterprises with a majority of pri-
vate shareholders:
(a) companies where the capital is held solely by
private natural or juridical persons;
(b) companies where more than half of the capital is
held by private natural or juridical persons,
through the remainder is held by the Government
or public agencies, or institutions where the
Government is a majority shareholder.
SNI will also be able to finance companies where
more than half of the capital is held by the Gov-
ernment, by public agencies, or by institutions
where the Government is a majority shareholder
provided that:
- The decision to finance these companies
receives the unanimous approval of the
Board of Directors of the SNI.
- The total amount of financial assistance which
the SNI will grant to these enterprises shall
not exceed at any time 25% of total outstanding
commitments (total amount of equity investments,
medium and long term loans and guarantees).
(4) The total amount of financial assistance which the SNI
shall grant to any single company, in the form of loans
or equity investments, shall not normally exceed 15% of
the SNI's owAm resources (share capital plus free reserves
plus grant plus Government loan ranking pari passu with
the share capital). In exceptional cases, where the finan-
cial assistance of the SNI exceeds such limit, the Board
of Directors shall examine the project particularly care-
fully after a detailed and thorough study conducted by the
Management.
The SNI shall not engage in operations, whether loan or
equity investment, by subscription, requiring less than
D 15,000 from SNI.
No equity investment in an industrial or tourist enterprise
shall exceed 10% of the SNI's own resources as defined above.
In the exceptional cases in which the equity participation



ANNEX 9
Page 3
of SNI will exceed this limit, the Board of Directors will
have the opportunity to study the project in especially
great depth. The total amount of SNI's equity investments
shall in no case or at any time exceed the total of the
capital, free reserves, grant, and the Government loan rank-
ing pari passu with the share capital.
(5) The SNI's equity investments in industrial and tourist
enterprises shall be as diversified as possible between
the industrial and tourist sectors and within a specific
sector.
(a)  With regard to industry, among various groups such
as: mining, chemicals, mechanical industry, tex-
tile industry, food industry, etc.
(b)  With regard to tourism:  both among various types of
hotels (de luxe and intermediate categories), vacation
centers, etc; and between hotels located in the southern,
central and northern regions of the country.
(6) The SNI shall not, as a matter or principle, hold a majority
of shares in a company, except:
(a)  where SNI acts as promoter of an enterprise and expects
to place shares among private subscribers which will
bring its holding down to a minority position (below
50%);
(b)  where the company under consideration is in a difficult
financial situation reqniring the direct intervention
of the STI in the best interests of SI.
As a general rule, the SNI shall not allorT itself to assume
the managerial responsibility of enterprises in which it
shall have an equity investment.
(7)  A loan which the SRI is requested to grant to a company
directed by a memiber of SNI's Board of Directors, and in
which this director holds a large equity participation,
shall be:
orn Fte one hand, granted only after due con-
sideration and approval by the Board of Direc-
tors as a whole;
-  on the other hand, subject to a special report
of the auditors to the next Ordinary General
Meeting, in accordance with the provisions of
the Code of Commerce.



ANNEX 9
Page 4
(8) The SNI will support all initiatives for the development of
the capital and securities markets. In particular, it will
take the following measures:
- it will endeavor to ensure the maximum turnover
of its portfolio by giving preference to the
resale of all or part of the good securities held;
- it will subscribe to share issues, whether the
companies are borrowers or not from the SNI;
- it will take part in the pr,motion of "variable
capital" investment companies (mutual funds) or
any other type of portfolio investment companies.
- it will take part in securities markets operations
to buy shares and any other securities (bonds for
example).
IV. Financial Policy
(1) The SNI shall ensure that the total of medium- and long-term
debts outstanding (i.e. maturing beyond one year) does not
exceed at any time four times the total of its share capital
plus free reserves, plus grant, plus Government loan ranking
pari passu with the share capital.
(2) For each foreign borrowing, the SNI shall protect itself
against any exchange risk arising from loans in foreign
currencies. It shall consider with the proper Tunisian
authorities the measure to be taken in this respect.
(3) The SNI shall obtain from its lending, guarantee and other
operations a rate of interest and commission sufficiently
high for it to be reasonably profitable, build adequate
reserves and distribute a small dividend.
(4) From the profits of each year of operations, the SNI shall,
in addition to the legal reserve, establish a provision for
contingencies and extraordinary reserves reasonably commen-
surate with its commitments and the nature of the risks
involved. It shall also pay reasonable dividends in accor-
dance with its annual profits.

V.   Organization
(1) The SNI shall recruit a highly qualified personnel for the
financial and technical analysis of the projects to be
financed.

technical assistance to its clients and to enable them to
adopt modern management techniques.
