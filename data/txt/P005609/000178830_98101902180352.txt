INTERNATIONAL BANX FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOI1ENDATION OF TIIE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED FOURTH LOAN TO THE
SOCIETE NATIONALE D'INVESTISSEMENT
WITH A GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
1.        I submit the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Socidtd Nationale d'Investissement S.A. (SNI), to be guaranteed
by the Republic of Tunisia, for the equivalent of US$10 million to help
finance lending for industry and tourism. Amortization would conform
substantially to the aggregate of the amortization schedules applicable to
the specific investment projects financed out of th.e proceeds of the loan,
with a maximum period of 15 years from the approval of an investment project.
The interest rate would be 7-'> percent per annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The Bank Group first began lending to Tunisia in 1962 with a
credit to help finance five secondary schools and since that time has been
active in a wide range of sectors including agriculture, fisheries, industry,
transportation, tourism and population planning. Outstanding commitments
of the Bank and IDA now total almost $150 million. IFC has in addition made
investments in a fertilizer plant, the SNI and COFITOUR, a hotel financing
company, with a total amount now held of $11.4 million. A summary statement
of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments is at Annex I.
3.        This perhaps unusually wide range of Bank Group lending in a
relatively small country reflects the fact that although Tunisia's resources
are on a more modest scale than those of her North African neighbors, they
are quite varied. Tunisia has, moreover, a climate and history that have
latterly emerged as the base for a promising tourism industry. Bank Group
assistance has aimed at financing both the infrastructure needed for growth
and the development of resources. Institution building has figured prom-
inently in most operations. A current objective is to assist the Govern-
ment in implementing new economic policies, summarized in paragraph 9
below, designed to achieve higher rates of growth by encouraging renewed
private initiative. The proposed fourth loan to SNI is directly in line
with this objective. Other lending in prospect will focus on projects to
stimulate production in agriculture and industry, support the growth of
tourism and help develop education and urban infrastructure. A power
project and a tourism infrastructure project are scheduled for presentation
to the Executive Directors before the end of the current fiscal year.

4.        Execution of ongoing projects has generally been satisfactory
with some exceptions. A detailed account of the problems encountered in
implementing the Cooperative Farm Project of 1967 (Loan No. 484 and Credit
No. 99) was contained in mr memorandum to the Executive Directors of
November 5, 1970 (R70-213). The Executive Directors approved amendments to
the original Loan and Credit Agreements on November 17, 1970. These amend-
ments became effective on March 24, 1971. Project implementation is now
progressing satisfactorily and disbursements are on schedule.
5.        After initial delays, primarily due to the damages caused by
exceptional floods in early 1970, the Railroad Project of 1969 (Loan No. 606/
Credit No. 150) is now proceeding well and is expected to be completed
by the end of 1973, approximately one year behind the original schedule.
The Highway Project of 1971 (Loan No. 746) is being executed satisfactorily.
6.        My memorandum to the Executive Directors of August 2, 1971
(IDXA71-5 indicated that a substantial part of the Second Education
Project of 1966 (Credit No. 94) would be unexpended as a result mainly of
savings in the cost of construction and equipment, and recommended a
reallocation of part of the proceeds of the credit to finance additional
educational facilities and technical assistance in educational planning.
The Tunisian authorities are now proceeding with procurement and construct-
ion of additional schools. A survey of technical assistance requirements
was recently made by a consultant, and recruitment of experts is to be
initiated shortly.
7.        The fourth SNI project was the subject of field appraisals in
February and August 1971. Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in
Washington in November/December 1971. SNI was represented by Mr. Habib
Bourguiba Jr. and the Government of Tunisia, as Guarantor, by Mr. Mrad.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
8.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Tunisia" (EMA-38a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on August 18,
1971. A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex II. A map of Tunisia is
also attached.
9.        The report stressed the crucial importance of fol'Lowing through
with the development strategy introduced by the Government in November 1970.
Increased production, exports and employment are major objectives to be
achieved mainly by encouraging private initiative, and, to that end,
reducing direct Government involvement in economic decisions, decentralizing
responsibility for the management of the econory and relaxing administrative
regulations.
10.       Production has developed favorably in 1971 because of better
agricultural crops, due to good weather, and a very good tourist season.
Real GDP has risen by about 8 percent. Because of higher export prices






- 3 -
for oil and larger receipts from tourism and workers' remittances, foreign
exchange earnings were substantially hligher than in 1970, preventing a
further widening of the current deficit in the balance of payments despite
the continued increase in imports. As capital inflows remained at a high
level, the gradual improvement in reserves achieved during the last three
years continued.
11.       Industrial development in the last decade has been carried out
mainly by the public sector. Apart from investing throagh publicly-owned
enterprises, the Government extended its control over the industrial sector
through nationalization and purchase of various undertakings which were
formerly owned by foreign firms. As a result, by far the greater part
of industrial capacity is nowT publicly owned. Private industrial activity
is concentrated in small and medium scale enterprises.
12.      M4anufacturing contributes about 15 percent to GDP. The develop-
mert of the sector has focussed, to a large extent on import substitution
and processing of minerals for export. Because of the small size of the
domestic market and deteriorating wiorld market conditions for phosphates,
manufacturing output has grown slowly. Government control over investment
decisions and management of public enterprises, and the extensive regulation
of trade, foreign exchange, investment and prices also hindered industrial
development.
13.       Good opportunities exist for establishing export industries.
The 1969 Association Agreement with the EEC allows most Tunisian industrial
exports duty-free access to the Community, while proximity to Europe and
substantial labor reserves offer scope for foreign direct investment.
14.       Up to 1969 industrial policy had given priority to import
substitution by state enterprises, but over the last year the Government
has decided to encourage private enterprise. ITeasures have been taken to
make industrial protection more selective and to foster competition through
greater reliance on the market mechanism. Mlore recently, the authorities
have prepared new legislation providing substantial incentives for domestic
and foreign firms to establish export-oriented industries. Efforts are
also being made to improve the institutional arrangements for facilitating
foreign investment. IFC will assist the Government in developing contacts
with industrial organizations abroad.
15.       Tourism started from a low level and expanded rapidly in the
1960's.  It has now become a major foreign exchange earner (about $P100
million in 1971), source of employment and means of diversifying the
econory. Demand is likely to continue to expand, and hotel capacity
will remain a main constraint on increased earnings. The Government is
drawing up a master plan for tourism development in seven zones through
1985, and feasibility studies on infrastructure are being completed.
16.       It is within this context of encouragement to manufacturing and
tourism that Bank lending to SMI is important to Tunisia. SRI represents






- 4 -
the major source of long-term local curTency funds and untied foreign
exchange funds for small and medium-sized Tunisian private entrepreneurs
in the manufacturing sector whom the Government is now seeking to encourage.
Similarly, it is a key source of funds for the tourism sector.
17.      Tunisia's foreign debt burden is high: in 1970 the debt service
ratio was about 22 percent. This ratio (including service of new borrowing)
is likely to decline to about 19 percent during 1973-76. The debt structure
has improved thanks to the restraint over the past few years in short and
medium-term borrowing and the availability of foreign aid on favorable
conditions. Tunisia's continued creditworthiness for long-term borrowring
on commercial terms depends on a large proportion of new external assistance
being made available on concessional terms.
18.       The Consultative Group for Tunisia met in October and discussed
the economic position and prospects of the country. Tunisia's new economic
policy objectives were welcomed. It was agreed that Tunisia would need
assistance on concessional terms for several years and the members of the
Group expressed their wrillingness to continue providing such aid.
PART III - THE PROJECT
19.       An appraisal report on the Soci6td Nationale d'Investissement
(No. DB-81a) dated December 28, 1971 is being distributed separately.
A Loan and Project Sumary is attached as Annex III.
Establishment of SNI
20.       The Societe Nationale d'Investissement (SNI) was established
in 1959 and reorganized in 1965 with the assistance of the Bank Group.
After the completion of a 100 percent share capital increase on January 29,
1971, the D 3.0 million share capital is held as follows: Tunisian public
sector 24.2 percent, Tunisian private sector (including about 60,000 indiv-
iduals) 42.5 percent, foreign shareholders 13.3 percent and IFC 20 percent.
The Bank made three loans to SNI, the first for $.`5 million in I-ay 1966
(No. 449), the second for 10 million in September 1967 (No. 512), and
the third also for $10 million in December 1969 (Hio. 648). The Swedish
International Development Agency (SIDA) has made two long-term loans to
SNI, totalling US$9 million. In addition, SNI obtained about D 1.1 million
from banks and the government in Tunisia. The Government has also provided
SNI with a grant of D 0.5 million.
Objectives and Role of S11I
21.       According to its Statement of General Policies and Operations,
S1TI is to stimulate industrialization and the development of tourism in
Tunisia through the financing of sound and productive projects. It also
seeks to help develop the capital market and, in particular, to broaden
the securities market.






-5-
22.       From 1966 to the end of 1970, SNI approved 211 loans and equity
investments amounting to D 21.6 million. SN'I doubled the volume of its
annual operations from D 3.2 million in 1968 to D 6.7 million in 1970.
Approvals for the current year through November 1971 were D 5.9 million.
23.       SNI finance has been mainly in the form of loans, wJhich
represented 84 percent of SN1I operations since 1968. Terms were from
five to twielve years. Normally SNIF charges 9 percent interest. 4hile
interest rates charged by Tunisian banks range from 7 to 8 percent for
short and medium-term credits, SNI has been able to maintain its 9 percent
rate, because its loans are long-term and its foreign exchange loans are not
tied to procurement in specific countries. Horeover, the foreign exchange
risk, when foreign credit lines wrere used, has been borne by the Government.
24.       SNI's equity investments totalling about D 2 million were, at the
beginning of 1971, close to the limit its policy Statement permits, i.e.
the equivalent of its net wJorth. The share capital increase wizll allow it to
continue to expand its equity investments. The most important single
equity investment (D 830,000) was SlJI's subscription to COFITOUR (Compagnie
Financiere et Touristique), in iwhich IFC also is a principal investor.
25.      SWI has been active in financing manufacturing and tourism.
flJhile total manufacturing investment in Tunisia increased on the average by
less than 5 percent annually since 1956, SNI's share in financing industrial
investment increased from 5 percent in 1966 to 12 percent in 1970. SNI
has financed about 13 percent of total investment in tourism since 1968
and tourism now accounts for about 41 percent of SNI's portfolio.
26.       Through the projects it has financed, SFI1 has made a substantial
contribution to Tunisia's foreign exchange position. Tourism is Tunisia's
leading foreign exchange earner and the hotels financed by SMI have had a
marked impact on Tunisia's foreign exchange receipts. In the manufacturing
sector, 20 percent of SNI's funds have gone to enterprises exporting over
half of their production. As the Government increases its incentives for
exports, SNI would be in a position to do even more in this field. Until
1969 SNI did not finance public sector enterprises as a matter of policy.
Since then SNII has approved eight loans for D 3.5 million for such enter-
prises. These loans have been made principally for projects in transport
(buses) and construction materials.
27.       Despite its increasing operational wjorkc load in the past four
years and scarcity of experienced staff, SNI has tried to assist small
industrial enterprises and has recently given increasing attention to
applications for loans to such enterprises. Since new Tunisian entre-
preneurs are to be found mainly in snall and medium-sized enterprises, SFI
is justified in supporting this type of activity.






- 6 -
28.       A pressing issue facing the Government is unemployment. SNI1s
operations have had only a modest impact on the overall problem since they
affect a small part of total economic activity in the country. However,
SNI estimates that industrial projects financed by it have added about
4,000 jobs between 1966 and 1970. The capital cost per job was $12,000.
Jobs created by SNIts tourism investments in the same period total 5,000
at a capital cost per job of $10,000. The capital cost per-job figures
are reasonable given the sectors SNI is financing. SNI has, neverthe-
less, agreed that it will focus more explicitly on the employment impact
in selecting among investment proposals.
Organization
29.       Board of Directors and Executive Committee.  SNIts Board of
Directors has 14 members. Mr. Habib Bourguiba Jr. was elected President-
Director General on March 8, 1971 to replace iMr. Moncef Belkodja, who
has agreed, for the time being, to remain as a Director with special
executive powers on SNI's staff. IFC is represented on SNI's Board.
The Board meets three or four times a year. It reviews general policy
matters and has to approve all loans and investments of more than
D 200,000. Transactions below this level are dealt with by SNIts
Executive Committee, composed of 7 Board members.
30.       Management, Staff and Procedures. The organization and opera-
tional performance of SNI began to weaken in mid-1969, with the departure
of several senior officers at a time when SNIPs operations and portfolio
were growing considerably. These developments affected adversely the
quality of project appraisal; technical and marketing evaluations of
projects in particular were weak, and the economic merits of projects not
well reviewed. Internal coordination also suffered.
31.       During the past year, the new management has initiated measures
to improve SNIIs capabilities. An International Executive Service Corps
consultant was engaged to advise SNI on steps to strengthen its organiza-
tion and administration. Based on the comments by the consultant and Bank
staff, SNI has started to carry out a reorganization to improve its project
appraisal work as well as to develop its promotional capability, essentially
through strengthening its engineering staff. SNI is also strengthening its-
follow-up staff, and is arranging for additional training of other staff.
Organizational changes have been made and senior SNI personnel have
been placed in-assignments more appropriate to their competence. New staff
has been hired, bringing professional staff strength to 27. The Bank will
pay close attention to progress made in the intended improvements.
32.       With respect to project appraisal, SNI has recently adopted
more refined methods for establishing rates of return for project selec-
tion purposes. It is also improving the economic aspects of its appraisal
work and is consulting with the Bank on ways to strengthen its work in
this area.

Financial Results
33.       Net earnings for 1970 were about D 134,000, equivalent to
nearly 9 percent on the then share capital. They were about one-third
less than in 1969, mainly because administrative expenses increased due
to the cost of the share increase and because SNIts tax exemption had
expired at the end of 1969. SNIts 1971 net profits are likely to be
somewhat higher than last year. SNI paid a 6 percent dividend on 1970
results.
34.       Total assets grew rapidly from D 6 million in 1967 to nearly
D 15 million at the end of 1970 and further growth has been experienced
since then. SNI's financial position at the end of 1970 was sound and
its liquidity was strong, with net working capital of over D 1 million.
This figure rose to D 1.3 million by November 1971. SNI's debt equity
ratio as defined in the loan agreements with the Bank stood at tho end
of October 1971 at about 2:1 against a limit of 41L.
35.       Overdues increased in 1970 and the initial audit was incomplete
due to inadequate information. Following this, in the course of 1971,
a thorough appraisal of the situation was made by SNI, its auditors and
Bank staff and the conclusion was that SNI's portfolio is sound. The
hard core loss possibilities are small and amply covered by provisions
for bad debts (D 102,000). SNI is taking measures to reduce arrears, and
has been able to bring-them by the end of October 1971 to about D 570,000
as compared with D 750,000 at the beginning of 1971. Another difficulty
is that on a number of loans, SNI is the major creditor but does not have
a senior security position due to legal complications in registering mort-
gages. SNI and the Tunisian Government are currently working on remedying
this situation and this problem will likely be solved by the end of 1972.
ProJected Operations and Resource Requirements
36.       Forecasts of Operations.  SNI has based its five-year forecast
of operations (1972-76) on an assumed modest growth of investment in
industry of about 4 percent per annum and of hotel financing of about 11
percent per annum which is in line with the Governmentts plans. This would
mean a higher share of SNIts tourism investment than in the past, but
given SNIts capabilities, this appears probable. Total contractual com-
mitments in the 1972-76 period are forecasted at D 40 million, including
D 7.9 and D 7.4 million in 1972 and 1973 respectively.
37.       To meet forecast commitments of about D 40 million through 1976,
SNI has to raise, in addition to the D 2.5 million of uncommitted resources
available at the beginning of 1972, another D 37 million. SNI expects to
fill most of this gap by internal cash generation and by further recourse
to its present foreign creditors, the Bank and SIDA. SNI also will have -
to intensify efforts to tap fresh sources of both dinar and foreign fundss
and it hopes to borrow, with the Government's endorsement, some amounts
from bilateral aid sources. However, in the short run, SNI will have to






-8-
continue to look mainly to SIDA and the Bank. Looking to the end of
1973, a two-year period to which the Bank normally would relate its
lending to a development finance company, SNIts total commitments are
estimated at about D 15.3 million. SNI, to cover these commitments, would
have to find resources of about D 13 million, of which D 11 million would
be required to finance import needs. SNI hopes to obtain a third SIDA
credit of D 4 million in 1972. This plus internal cash generation leaves
a gap of about D 8.6-million. The proposed loan of $10 nmllion, equivalent
to about D 5 million, would, however, cover SNIts commitments for imports
only until about the end of 1972, i.e. for about one year. Limiting Bank
assistance on this occasion to the estimated requirements for only one year
is considered prudent in view of the weaknesses which have arisen in
SNIts work and the need to evaluate SNIts progress in carrying out its
reorganization program. A reappraisal of SNI will be made in mid-1972 with
a view to possible further lending early in 1973.
38.    - Total assets are expected to more than double in the period
1972-76, reaching a level of about D 40 million at the end of 1976. SNi1s
long-term debt will remain below the limit agreed with the Bank. SNIts
earning prospects are reasonably good. Net profits are expected to increase
from about 6-percent of net worth in 1972 to 13 percent in 1976. With
such returns, and continuing prudent appropriations to reserve, SNI should
be able in a few years to distribute dividends higher than the 6 percent
paid out in 1971.
Terms of the Proposed Bank Loan
39.       The proposed loan to SNI follows the terms and conditions of
recent Bank loans to other development finance companies, including the
standard commitment-charge. The free limit above which Bank approval of a
project is required, would be maintained at $200,000. The aggregate free
limit would be $2.5 million. The debt limit as defined in the previous
loan agreement would also be retained. The financing of public sector
enterprises would not exceed 25 percent of the amount of the proposed loan
without the agreement of the Bank.
40.       SNI is, with the Bank Groupts assistance, continuing its important
role in the Tunisian economy. It has recently experienced difficulties
in its organization and staff, but the remedial measures which are being
introduced should enable the Company to cope effectively with the growing
tasks ahead* SNI is creditworthy for the additional financing proposed.

PART IV - IEGAL INSTRUNENYTS AND AUTHORITY
41        The draft Loan Agreemient between the Bank and SNI, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Tunisia-and the Bank, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III$ Section 4 (iii) of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans for develop-
ment finance companies.
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
43.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
