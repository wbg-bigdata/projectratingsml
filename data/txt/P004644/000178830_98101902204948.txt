REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE KOR THE
SECOND SINGAPORE SEWERAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Singapore for the equivalent of US$12.0 million to help finance the Second
Singapore Sewerage Project. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including
5 years of grace, with interest at 4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The last economic report on Singapore (EAP-29) was distributed to
the Executive Directors on January 24, 1972.  An economic mission visited
Singapore in April 1973.  Its report will be circulated shortly.  The mission's
principal conclusions are discussed below.  Country data are included in
Annex I.
3.        Singapore achieved self government in 1959; in 1962 it became a member
of the Federation of Malaysia. Since then Singapore has encountered and overcome
a series of political and economic difficulties. These have included the confronta-
tion with Indonesia between 1963 and 1965, and Singapore's separation from the
Federation of Malaysia in 1965. Moreover, with entrepot trade as a mainstay of
its economy (contributing 17.4 percent of GDP in 1961) Singapore was exposed to
themanyvagaries of international price fluctuations. Then in the mid-1960's,
Singapore was faced with severe unemployment, which was subsequently compounded
by the withdrawal of British forces which at that time provided some 50,000 jobs to the
economy and represented a sizeable contribution - some 17 percent - to GDP.
4.        As a remedial measure, the Government adopted a policy aimed at rapid
development of the manufacturing sector, encouraging a labor-intensive, export
oriented industry mix, while extending a welcoming hand to foreign investment in
the form of fiscal incentives, duty-free import of capital goods and raw material
requirements, as well as tariff protection, on a selective basis and usually for
a specified time period. A further incentive to foreign investors was the growth
and development of Singapore's financial sector. Moreover, changes in labor
legislation adopted in 1968 guaranteed the private investor a high degree of wage
stability and minimized the possibility of labor unrest.
5.        The success of this policy has been evident in the rapid growth of
Singapore's economy in the second half of the last decade. Between 1966 and
1971 overall GDP grew at an average annual rate of 14 percent. The manufacturing
sector, the major source of growth, has averaged some 24 percent annual growth
since 1969, thus doubling its contribution to GDP during the last decade, from
10.4 percent in 1962 to 22.1 percent in 1971. Direct foreign investment has
played the leading role in this remarkable growth, reflecting a high degree of
international confidence in Singapore 's growth potential. Growth in exports of domestic
products,which averaged 22 percent annually between 1966 and 1971, has also been
impressive. Other noteworthy sectors have been construction and tourism whose
annual growth rate between 1966 and 1971 were 26 and 32 percent respectively. A
further measure of the Government's success hag been the cnntinuing reduiction



in the economy's reliance on entrepot trade.    Although entrepot trade still
figures largely in total trade (some 40 percent in 1971), its contribution
to GDP has declined from 17.4 percent to 10.5 percent in the period 1961-71.
6.        However, the Government's policy has not been without problems.
What had been a labor surplus economy (the official unemployment rate in
1965 was 8.7 percent) has been transformed into one which now faces spot
labor shortages, and indeed this is one of the most critical problems which
must be solved if Singapore's recent economic performance is to be maintained.
The Government is well aware of this problem and has prudently adopted a number
of measures which should mitigate this difficulty.    With regard to the lower
skill levels, the granting of work permits to immigrant (mostly Malaysian)
labor has been liberalized.    Estimates of the number of such laborers, who are
largely concentrated in the construction industry, currently range anywhere from
60,000 to 100,000, or 8-13 percent of the domestic labor force.    Moreover,
female participation in the labor force is being encouraged and the adoption
of more mechanized production techniques, particularly in the construction
industry, is increasing.
7.        The Government's cognizance of the economy's manpower constraint is
reflected in its increasing selectivity in the types of new industries coming
lnto Singapore.  Henceforth only those industries which can guarantee a deep-
ening of the industrial structure beyond the simple assembly-type operations,
which have predominated in the past, will be encouraged.    This will imply a
general upgrading of skill levels required throughout the economy with consequent
increases in labor productivity.    The Government has continually stressed that
Singapore's long-term future lies in her human resources, and current policies
aimed at the development of a highly skilled and sophisticated workforce are
consistent with this objective.
8.        While the sixties presented a decade of phenomenal growth, the last
two years showed some slowdown of the economy. In 1972, GDP registered 13
percent growth in current prices as compared with 14 percent in 1971 and an
average of 15 percent between 1967 and 1970. Moreover, while precise data on price
trends do not exist, until recently, inflation was negligible. However, in
1972 unofficial estimates of inflation range between 3 and 5 percent, and thus
real growth in 1972 was probably less than 10 percent.
9.        The major factors in last year's"recession" were firstly, the term-
ination of the Viet Nam War which manifested itself in greatly reduced demand
in the petroleum refining industry, secondly, the decline in British military
spending and thirdly, the uncertainty resulting from two years' of international
monetary crises which are thought to have adversely affected the trade sector
and the inflow of foreign investment.
10.       Public sector finance has been marked by sound management and the
vigorous savings efforts of the C-overnment.   In FY72/73 the current account
surplus was some US$119 million, and it is projected at US$214 million in
FY73/74.   Growth in Government revenue has averaged some 11 percent annually for
the last five years,with increasing reliance on tax revenue, and in particular



- 3 -
on direct taxes, thus making the tax system more responsive to increases
in income.   Public sector investments in FY72/73 totalled US$399 million;
in FY73/74 this is expected to rise to US$52h million.    These investments
are primarily undertaken by a group of well run and financially sound
statutory authorities, which in FY72/73 accounted for 73 percent of total
public investment.
11.       The balance of payments continues to be very strong. Overall surpluses
have been realized every year since 1966; in 1972 the surplus amounted to US$202
million. This had been possible despite a growing deficit in recorded merchandise
trade which has been more than compensated by surpluses in the service account,
long-term capital inflows, and increases in net errors and omissions in Singapore's
favor; it is believed that the latter mainly reflects unrecorded merchandise trade,
particularly with Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines and unrecorded sterlina
capital inflows. From 1971 to 1972, net foreign exchange reserves increased by
Us$334 million to US$1 .8 billion approximately equal to six months imports. A closer
analysis of the components of the balance of payments is not possible due to the
absence of information on the errors and ommissions item. In 1972 this entry amounted
to over US$1 billion. Any reallocation of this item would thus drastically
affect estimates of the current accounts balance and long-term capital inflows.
12.       The major problems which will confront the Government in the near
future appear to be the availability of labor, especially at the skilled and
technical levels, and inflation, particularly imported inflation. The latter
is a growing source of concern since price and wage stability have hitherto been
the hallmarks of the Singaporean economy and a major factor in its ability to
attract foreign investment. The Government is, however, well aware of the labor
and inflation problems and is taking steps to remedy them as far as possible.
Its proposals for ameliorating the labor shortage have been discussed above. The
problem of inflation is more formidable, since insulating Singapore against
imported inflation would imply sacrificing the basic openness of the economy. In
recent efforts to absorb excess liquidity, and thereby prevent excessive overheating
of the economy, the Government has twice raised the minimum reserve requirement
commercial banks must hold with the monetary authority.
13.       The size of long-term private capital inflows will influence official
external borrowing requirements. The current outlook for foreign investment,
except in the oil industry, appears favorable. However, investment in the oil
refining industry, which has represented a major part of foreign investment in
the past is likely to be minimal in the immediate future due to the existence
of excess capacity at the present time. With the further development of the
financial sector it is 2ikely that local capital will play an increasingly
important role in the expansion of existing industries. However, Singapore
remains vulnerable to external economic fluctuations, as evidenced by the
economy's slowdown during the past year.    Given the nature of the economy this
situation will necessarily prevail in the future. This factor, along with
the need for sizeable investments in some kinds of urban infrastructure for
which external project financing may be difficult to secure, but which are
imperative to Singapore's future growth, justifies the continuation of official
project borrowing on a limited scale.



14.       Singapore's external public debt position shows US$i12 million out-
standing (including undisbursed) as of December 31, 1972. About 27 percent of
this is due to the Bank, 17 percent to the Asian Development Bank, and 19 percent
to the UK Government; suppliers credits represent about 5 percent. The debt
service burden arising from this debt was US$32.5 million in 1972, of which
US$8.7 million was due to the Bank , or about 26 percent. The total debt service
in 1972 represented about 2 percent of Gross National Savings and 3 percent
of domestic exports. By 1978 Singapore's outstanding external debt (including
undisbursed) is expected to drop to US$326 million and. the annual debt service
burden is projected to reach US$41.3 million, or about 1.5 percent of domestic
exports. Singapore is thus creditworthy for ex-ternal borrowing on conventional
terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPEELATIONS IN SINGAPORE
15.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's twelfth operation in Sirzganore.
The previous loans were for power, telecommunications, port modernization
and expansion, water supply and sewerage, education, and,through the Develop-
ment Bank of Singapore,for industrial development.  As of April 30, 1973,
the loans to Singapore held by the Bank amounted to US$108.2 million. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans as of April 30, 1973,and notes on
the execution of on-going projects.
16.       The Bank lending strategy aims essentially at providing financial
and technical support to institutions in the forefront of Singapore's develop-
ment process.   Some of the institutions to which we have lent in the past
have now become administratively and technically strong and are able to finance
future expansion from their own resources or borrowings from commercial sources
abroad.   Future Bank lending will therefore be limited to those projects that
continue to require either our technical or financial assistance.   This implies
that the bulk of projects in which the Bank will participate in the future will
be in new and more difficult fields, such as mass transit, pollution control
and urban development,including water supply and sewerage.   The Bank is currently
serving as the Executing Agency for a UNDP-financed project to stud- Singapore's
mass transit requirements. This study could, if its results Pre saxlsfactory,
lead to a series of Bank loans.
PART III - WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SERVICES IN SICGAPORE
17.       The area of Singapore is only- 225 square miles.  Its present
population of about 2.2 million is mostly concentrated in the -rban area of the
south central part of the island.   The current rate of population increase
is sligh-tly less than 2.0 percent and population is estimated to reach about
3.6 million in the year 2000. With such a limited area, careful land use planning
is required to provide for the urban population, industry, agriculture, water
catchment and storage, and recreation.
18.       Water supply in Singapore was initially provided from catchment
areas and reservoirs in the central part of the island.   As demand increased,
sources of supply were developed in the State of Johore in Malaysia, with the
treated water being piped across the causeway to Singapore to supplement local
sources.   In recent years additional surface sources have been developed
locally and plans are underway to develop further local sources to reduce depend-
ence on supply from Malayisa.   However, sufficient groundwater is not available
on the island and the development of surface sources therefore needs careful



planning of land use for water catchment and storage and adoption of conservation
measures. A high degree of waste water treatment is required to reduce pollution
of the water resources and enable the re-use of as much water as possible.
19.       Water supply is the responsibility of the Public Utilities Board,
an autonomous agency, which also operates the electric and gas systems.
More than 80 percent of the population is served by the Public Water Supply
System and only those in the rural areas depend upon private wells and streams.
The water supply system is well operated and maintained; it supplies about
110 million imperial gallons per day.
20.       Until late 1972, a branch of the Public Works Department of the
Government of Singapore was responsible for sewage disposal.    Since then,
the responsibility for collection and disposal of sewage and solid waste
has been transferred to a newly created Ministry of the Environment. Its
Sewerage Department is operating satisfactorily.    With the completion of
the on-going project in the current year about 52 percent of the population
will be served by the sewage collection system, about 12 percent by septic
tank systems and the rest will be dependent on night-soil collection ser-
vices.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
21.       The project is part of an on-going program for improving the exist-
ing sewerage facilities and extending the sewerage system to serve newly
developing areas in Singapore. The first loan (547-SI), made in July 1968,
financed the foreign exchange cost of extensions and improvements to existing
sewerage systems in urban renewal and housing project areas, improvement
and expansion of existing pumping stations and treatment works, and the con-
struction of five new pumping stations.    The execution of this improvement
program has been satisfactory. The proposed second project was appraised
by the Bank in March 1973 and negotiations were held in May 1973 with a
Singaporean delegation led by Mr. Lee Ek Tieng, Acting Permanent Secretary,
Ministry of the Environment.    A Loan and Project Summary is included as
Annex III.  The Appraisal Report, No.160a-SI dated June 11, 1973, is being dist-
ributed separately.
Description
22.       The proposed second project would cover the sewerage works to be
carried out by the Sewerage Department from July 1, 1973 to June 30, 1978.
It would include (a) the laying of about 38 miles of sewer mains, (b)
improvements to eight existing sewerage facilities (pumping stations and
treatment plants), (c) the construction of additional pumping stations and
four sewerage treatment works, and (d) consulting services. The proposed
project would enable the Sewerage Department to extend sewer main services to
an additional 400,000 people, bringing the total population served by the
sewer main system to about 1.6 million in 1978.
Project Costs
23.       Total cost of the project is estimated at about US$29.5 million
equivalent; of this amount, about US$12.0 million or about 41 percent would be in
foreign exchange.   These estimates include a 10 percent physical contingency
and an annual price contingency of 3 percent.



-6-
Implementation
24.       The Sewerage Department of the Ministry of the Environment would be
responsible for the execution of the project and would be assisted by con-
sultants in the detailed design of the project.   The Sewerage Department's
performance under the first loan has been improving.   Nevertheless further
strengthening of the Sewerage Department's administration,staffing, and accounting
procedures will be necessary. Assurances were obtained that the Sewerage Department
will prepare a plan of action to deal with these matters.
Financial Position of the Sewerage Department
25.       Sewerage services in Singapore incurred losses up to FY70.  Since
FY70, however, the financial position of the Sewerage Department has improved
considerably.   Under Loan 547-SI the Government undertook to adjust sewerage
rates so as to produce a reasonable positive rate of return not later than
1972. In &krch 1970, the Government introduced water borne sewerage fees
based on water consumption.   As a result revenues increased substantially
and the Sewerage Department achieved a return of over 8 percent in 1971 and
1972 on its net fixed assets in service.   During negotiations assurances were
obtained from the Government that (a) the Sewerage Department will maintain
its fees for sewerage services at a Level not lower than the present one, and
(b) the Sewerage Department will continue to cover from its revenues its
operating costs, including depreciation, and debt service charges to the extent
they exceed the provision for depreciation. The financial projections indicate
that sewerage operations will continue to earn reasonable returns. The Sewerage
Department's rate of retur', on the net value of its fixed assets in operations
is expected to be between 6 percent and 7 percent throughout the period 1974-
1983.
Financing
26.       The proposed Bank loan of US$12.0 million would cover the foreign
exchange cost of the project.   The remainder would be financed from internal
cash generation. The total capital requirements dtring the project construction
period (FY74-79) are estimated at about US$37.0 million including on-going
investments partly financed under the first project.   Of these requirements
the proposed and existing Bank loans would finance US$12.6 million or about 35
percent, while internal cash generation of the Sewerage Department would finance
the remaining US$24.4 million or about 65 percent.   Internal cash generation
would also permit about US$8 million to be transferred to Government as a return
against past equity investments.
Procurement
27.       All construction and supply contracts would be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
A margin of preference to local manufacturers of 15 percent or the actual
customs duty, whichever is less, would be allowed. Local contractors are
expected to win all construction contracts and local manufacturers are expected
to win the sewer pipe contracts and possibly some contracts for mechanical and
electrical equipment.



-7-
28.       The loan will be disbursed against (a) the foreign exchange component
of the supply and installation of imported equipment whether directly imported
or locallyprocured; (b) a percentage of the cost of locally manufactured mechan-
ical and electrical equipjezt equal to the estimated ex-factory cost of such
equip.entj (c) a percentage of the civil works and sewer pipes contracts equal
to the estimated foreign exchange component and (d) the foreign excheange costs
of consultants' services. Contracts under (b) may amuount to some UJS$25C,OO0
and would involve a very minor element of local cost financing.
Ecology
29.       The extensions of the sewer system should reduce the number of
housing units using night-soil collection.  The collected sewage would be
given complete treatment and the quality of the effluent from the treatment
plants would normally be equal to or better than the quality of the water in
the receiving streams.   No pollution of beaches, fish or shellfish growing
areas will result from the effluent discharges.  The dried sludge will con-
tinue to be used on land as a fertilizer and soil conditioner.
Justification
30.       The expansion and improvement of sewerage services is essential to
Singapore's housing development and urban renewal programs and its continuing
industrial expansion. The project is the least cost solution for sewage col-
lection treatment and disposal given SingaporeIs land constraint.  Apart from
meeting Singapore's expanding requirements for sewerage services, the project
will have an additional benefit in that continued association with the Bank
will further strengthen and improve Sewerage Department's financial and tech-
nical competence.
31.       The sewerage construction program in Singapore is geared to keep
pace with the housing development program and the industrial development of
the country.   The housing development program calls for construction of about
30,000 units anually during the next five years. The sewerage extensions includ-
ed in this project are necessary to meet the needs of the s9panded housing
program and also the needs of the rapidly growing industries.
32.       In the older parts of the city and in the more sparsely populated rural
areas, liquid wastes are disposed of in septic tanks or collected through a night-
soil collection system with final disposal into the sewers. These methods are not
suitable for concentrated urban areas. The multiple-story housing, the urban
renewal projects and the new industrial developments being undertaken in Singapore
result in concentrations of population for which an adequate sewer system for the
removal of liquid wastes has become essential.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS ANDI AUTHORITY
33.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Singapore and the
Bank, the report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed to the Kxecutive Directors separately. The draft
agreements conform to the pattern normally used by the Bank for sewerage projects.



- 8 -
34.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
35.       I recommend that the ixecutive Directors approve the propqsed loan.

B.  PROJECTS IN EXECUTIONL/
Ln No. 462-SI     Singapore Port Project; US$15.0 Million Loarn of August 1i, 1968;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1973
The loan for this project was made in August 1966. Initially the
main part of the project comprised the construction of four deep-water berths.
However, in early 1968, due to rapid increases in the world container -traffic
and demand for such services in Singapore, the projec-t description was re-
vi.sed to allow for the construction of two container berths in lieu of the four
deep-water berths. The project, as revised, also includes construction of one
cross-berth for feeder service ships.  In addition, the project provides for
acquisition of floating craft, mechanical equipment and data processing equipment.
The revision in the project description and the resulting delays required postpone-
ment of the Closing Date from December 31, 1970 to December 31, 1973.  The execution
of the project is satisfactory. Although, as a result of the changes in project
description, the total project costs were about 30 percent higher than the
appraisal estimates, the economic viability of the project has not been affected
since the increases in traffic were considerably higher than the original estimates.
In fact due to rapid increases in containerized traffic, the Port of Singapore
Authority, in addition to the container berths provided under the projects, is now
in the process of constructing a third container berth.
LxI No. 503-SI    Water Supply Project;  US$23.0 Million Loan of July 5, 1967;
Part II        Closir  Date:  June 30, 1973
This project has two parts: one, a power project and another,
-a ter supply project.  The first part has already been corpleted.  The water
suXply project, for which US$6.9 million was included in the Loan amount, is
expected to be completed by June 1973.  It consists of construction of a dam,
installation of pumping stations, improvements to a treatment plantr and extensions
of the transmission and distribution system. The implementation of the project has
been behind schedule by about 15 months due partly to labor and constru.ction material
shortages and partly to changes in the design of transmissiona and primary aistrib-
ution components. Therefore, the Closing Date had to be postponed from March 1,
1972 to June 30, 1973. The cost of the project is expected to be about 20 percent
higher than the appraisal estimates mainly due to changes in the design oL the
didstribution network. These increases are entirely under the local c=rrency comp-
onent.  They will, however, not have any negative impact on the economic berefits
and financial rate of return.  Financial performance of t;he Water Departmenrt has
been significantly better than estimated during the appraisal.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.  They
should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

Ln No. 547-SI     First Sewerage Project;   US$6.0 Million Loan of July 3, 1968;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1973
The project is the first stage of the expansion of sewerage
facilities in Singapore. It consists of extension and improvement of the
existing sewer system in urban renewal areas and industrial estates, improve-
ment and expansion of the existing pumping stations and treatment works and
construction of five new pumping stations. The project has been behind
schedule due to inititial delays in planning and design. Therefore, the
Closing Date had to be postponed from June 30, 1973 to December 31, 1973.
The project costs are expected to be about 25% lower than the original
estimates. These savings are, however, in local expenditures and will,
therefore, have no effect on total disbursements from the Bank loan.
Ln No. 647-SI     Second Telecommunications Project;   US$11.0 Million Loan of
December 19, 1969;  Closing Date:  May 31, 1974
This project covers Singapore Telephone Board's program for
local telephone services for the years 1970 through 1973; it includes expansion
of exchange capacity by about 90,000 lines together with associated junction
and subscriber's lines by about 70,000 lines. Although the progress of the
project has been satisfactory, disbursement of this loan is not expected to
be completed by the present Closing Date, May 31, 1974. The delays in project
execution have been mainly due to the cancellation of the supplier's contract
for switching equipment with Messrs. L.M. Ericsson of Sweden after the latter
decided to close its factory in Singapore. The contract was based on progressive
manufacture of switching equipment in Singapore.
Ln No. 658-SI     Industrial Finance Project;   US$5.0 Million Loan of February 25
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1973
This loan was made to the Industrial Development Bank of
Singapore to supplement the resources of DBS in providing finance to privately
controlled productive enterprises in Singapore. The progress of this project
has been satisfactory. However, at the request of the Borrower about US$900,000
of this loan has been cancelled; disbursement of the rest of the loan is expected
to be completed by the Closing Date, June 30, 1973.
Ln No. 802-SI     Singapore Education Project;   US$9.5 Million Loan of February 25,
1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The project covers the first phase of the relocation of the
University of Singapore; it consists of the construction and furnishing of the
Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Architecture, The School of Accountancy and
Business Administration, central lecture premises, a computer center, administra-
tion and communal buildings and residential facilities for students and supervisory
staff. Preliminary work on the project was delayed by about three months because
the University Development Unit lost same structural engineering staff.   However,



ANNEX II
Page )4 of 4 pages
corrective measures have been taken and the progress of the project is now
satisfactory. Project costs are expected to be about 5% higher than the
appraisal base cost estimates, but they are well within the contingencies
included in the total cost estimates.

Procurement Arrangements:       All construction and supply contracts are to
be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding. A margin of preference
of 15% or the actual customs duty, whichever
is lower, will be allowed for local manufacturers.
Local construction contractors and pipe manufacturers
are expected to win the construction and pipe
contracts.
Consultants:                     Consultants have been and will continue to be retained
for feasibility-studies, detailed design of
mechanical-electrical installations, pumping stations
and treatment works including the preparation of
bidding documents, specifications and construction
drawings.
Rate of Return:                  No rate of return on the project has been calculated
because of the problem of measuring benefits and of
properly attributing to the project its share of the
benefits of an on-going sewerage program. This
expansion and improvement program, which is essential
to Singapore's housing development and urban renewal
programs and its continuing industrial expansion is
the least cost and only practical solution.
