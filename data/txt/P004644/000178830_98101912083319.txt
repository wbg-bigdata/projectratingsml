APPRAISAL OF THE
SINGAPORE SEWERAGE PROJECT - SECOND STAGE
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project to improve and expand
sewage collection and treatment facilities in Singapore for which a loan of
US$12.0 million is proposed. The project is the second stage of an on-going
sewerage program.
ii.       The Government of Singapore will be the borrower and the project
will be carried out by the Sewerage Department (SD) of the Ministry of the
Environment (MOE). The proposed loan will be the second such loan to Singa-
pore. The first loan (547-SI) made in July 1968 was for financing the for-
eign exchange costs of extensions and improvements to the existing sewer
system in urban renewal and housing project areas, the improvement and expan-
sion of existing pumping stations and treatment works and the construction
of five new pumping stations. These works are now being completed and the
loan will be fully disbursed by the closing date, December 31, 1973. An
objective of the first loan was to secure improvements in data collection,
accounting, management and financial performance in respect of sewerage
operations in Singapore and these have been largely realized.
iii.      The objective of the proposed second stage project is to continue
the program to provide sewer service to urban renewal and new housing project
areas and the necessary pumping stations and treatment facilities. The
Housing and Development Board plans to construct 30,000 units a year in
high-rise apartments for lower income groups and these units cannot be
occupied unless the sewage collection and disposal facilities included in
the project are constructed.
iv.       The project consists of extensions of the sewer system in existing
and new housing and industrial areas; the construction of new, and the
improvement and expansion of existing pumping stations and treatment works.
These facilities will provide sewer services to an estimated 400,000 people
not now served.
v.        The project is estimated to cost about US$29.5 million (S$ 75 mil-
lion). The proposed loan of US$12.0 million will cover about 41 percent of
the total project cost which is the estimated foreign exchange component.
Internal cash generation will finance the balance and also provide a surplus
of US$8.3 million equivalent for transfer to Government as a return against
past equity investment. All contracts will be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding. Most of the equipment will be imported
but the pipes will be manufactured locally using some imported raw materials.
The eligible local manufacturers will receive a preference of 15 percent
or the prevailing tariff, whichever is less.



- ii -
vi.       The project is the least cost and the only practicable solution
for collection, treatment and disposal of sewage in the concentrated urban
areas of Singapore.
vii.      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$12.0 million for a
period of 20 years including a grace period of five years.



SINGAPORE
APPRAISAL OF THE
SINGAPORE SEWERAGE PROJECT - SECOND STAGE
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Singapore has requested a loan of US$12.0 million
to help finance the foreign exchange cost of the second stage of an on-going
sewerage program. The project will be carried out by the Sewerage Department
(SD) of the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) which is responsible for all
sewerage works in Singapore. The project is estimated to cost US$29.5 mil-
lion equivalent.
1.02      In July 1968, the Bank provided a loan of US$6.0 million equivalent
(Loan 547-SI) to cover the foreign exchange cost of the sewerage works under
the first stage of a project to extend sewers to new and redeveloped urban areas,
improve sewage pumping stations and expand sewage treatment facilities. Con-
struction under the first project was slow to start due to changes and delays
in planning and design, but has been speeded up and the works will be
completed by December 1973, approximately 18 months behind original schedule.
The costs are well within the original estimate.
1.03      The organization and management of this sector in Singapore have
improved substantially as a result of the Bank's involvement in the first
project. On the basis of a study made under the first project, SD has been
reorganized, sewerage tariffs have been revised, and sewerage operations
have been placed on an entirely self-supporting basis. Improvements in
accounting have been made to enable an adequate analysis of the financial
performance of sewerage services.
1.04      The project has been prepared by SD which will be assisted by
specialist consultants on certain aspects of detailed design.
1.05      Appraisal of the project was carried out by a mission composed of
Messrs. Callejas, Spangler and Kapur who visited Singapore in March 1973.
II. THE SECTOR
General
2.01      The area of Singapore is approximately 225 square miles.  Its
present population of about 2.2 million is mostly concentrated in the urban
area in the south-central part of the Island. The rate of population
increase is now a little less than 2.0 percent; and the population is
estimated to reach about 3.7 million in 2025 (see Annex 1). With such a
limited area, careful land use planning is required to provide areas for
the urban population, industry, agriculture, water catchment and storage,
and recreation.



- 2 -
2.02      Water supply to Singapore was initially provided from catchment
areas and reservoirs in the central part of the Island. Subsequently, as
the demand increased, sources of supply were developed in Johore State in
Malaysia and the treated water piped across the causeway to Singapore to
supplement local sources. In recent years, additional surface sources on
the Island have been developed and plans are underway to develop further
local sources. Ground water is not available in sufficient quantity in the
Island for public water supply purposes. The development of surface sources
requires careful planning of land use for water catchment and storage,
adoption of water conservation measures and the selection of waste water
disposal methods to minimize land use. A high degree of waste water treatment
is also required to enable reuse of water as far as possible.
Development and Organization
2.03      Water supply is the responsibility of the Public Utilities Board (PUB),
an autonomous agency which also operates the electric and gas systems.
Substantially all the population is served by the public water supply system
although some people in the rural areas depend upon private wells and streams.
The water supply system is well operated and maintained and it supplies about
110 million Imperial gallons per day (IMgd) through some 302,000 connections.
The supply is continuous and of good quality. The Bank has made two loans
(Loan 405-MA and 503-SI) to PUB for water supply projects.
2.04      Until late 1972, a branch of the Public Works Department (PWD) of
the Government of Singapore was responsible for sewerage services. Since
then, MOE has been created and made responsible for collection and disposal
of sewage and solid wastes. With the completion of the first project, about
52 percent of the population (about 1.14 million) will be served by the
central sewage collection systems. About 12 percent of the population use
septic tank systems and the rest depend on nightsoil collection services.
Improvements and expansion of existing sewerage facilities and construction
of new sewerage systems for the developing areas are proposed in this
project. These facilities will provide sewer services for an additional
400,000 people, increasing the population served to about 65%.
III. THE PROJECT
3.01      The project is the second stage of an on-going program for improv-
ing existing sewerage facilities and extending the sewer system to serve
the newly developing areas in Singapore. Details of existing installations
including those financed under Loan 547-SI are described in Annex 2.
Description
3.02      The project includes the works to be carried out by SD during the
five years, July 1, 1973 to June 30, 1978 excluding works continuing from
the fist project. Sewage collection systems constructed in 10 different



- 3 -
areas under Loan 547-SI will be further extended and additional areas will be
provided with sewers to serve housing already built or which will be construct-
ed during the project period. The extension of major and minor sewers will
also be carried out in other built-up areas where the existing sewage collec-
tion system is inadequate.  The additions comprise about 29 miles of 12-60
inch diameter main sewers and 9 miles of 6-9 inch diameter branch sewers;
improvements to existing pumping stations and three existing sewage treatment
works; and construction of new pumping stations and four new sewage treatment
works. For the reasons given in paragraph 2.02, the new plants will provide
the same degree of sewage treatment as the existing facilities. Detailed
description of the project is in Annex 3 and the locations of the works are
shown in Map IBRD 10445.
Cost Estimates
3.03      The total cost of the project is estimated at S$ 75.0 million
(US$29.5 million). The estimates are summarized below and are shown in
greater detail in Annex 4.

3.04      The cost estimates are based on preliminary designs prepared by SD
and on contract awards for similar works under the first project (Loan 547-SI).
An overall provision of 10 percent on all items for physical contingencies
has been added and is considered adequate. An annual price contingency of
about 3 percent has been adopted after a review of costs of equipment,
materials and wages over the last three years. The foreign exchange component
has been estimated on the assumption that the mechanical and electrical equip-
ment will be imported and the construction contracts and most pipe supply
contracts will be won by local firms, as has happened under Loan 547-SI.



-4-
Amount of Proposed Loan
3.05      A Bank loan of US$12.0 million, equal to about 41 percent of the
total project cost of US$29.5 million, is proposed to finance the estimated
foreign exchange costs of the project and the consultants' fees.
Planning, Engineering and Construction Supervision
3.06      The planning for the sewage collection systems and the timing of
construction are largely determined by the decisions of the Housing and
Development Board with which close coordination is maintained by SD. The
overall planning of the sewerage program and design of sewers are done by
SD and performance under the first project has been good. Consulting engineers
are retained for feasibility studies and detailed design of mechanical-
electrical installations, pumping stations and treatment works including the
preparation of tender documents, specifications and construction drawings.
Consultants are used for the design of sewers if SD's staff are unable to
handle the workload. For these purposes, SD has engaged Messrs. J. D. and
D. M. Watson (Singapore and UK); Camp, Dresser and McKee (USA); and Lau,
Downie and Balfour (Singapore and UK). These arrangements have worked out
satisfactorily under the first project and will be continued for this project.
Assurances have been obtained that SD will continue to retain engineering
consultants acceptable to the Bank. SD would be responsible for overall
project administration.
3.07      Under the first loan, SD agreed to install flow measurement devices
at various points in the system and maintain a continuous program of data
collection, analyses, investigations and records in order to provide informa-
tion on population served, flow patterns, sewage characteristics and the
effectiveness of treatment. This information provides the basis for design
and operation improvements. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that SD will continue this program of data collection and analyses.
Procurement
3.08      All construction and supply contracts will be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding following the Bank's guidelines for
procurement. Local contractors are expected to win all construction contracts
and local manufacturers are expected to win the sewer pipe supply contracts.
A margin of preference to local manufacturers of 15 percent or customs duty,
whichever is less, is proposed to be allowed as in the case of the first
project.
Disbursement
3.09      It is proposed that the loan be disbursed against (a) 100% of
the foreign expenditures for supply and installation of directly imported
equipment; (b) 85% of the total expenditures for the supply and installation
of imported equipment procured locally; (c) 95% of the local expenditures for
the supply and installation of locally manufactured equipment; (d) the



estimated foreign exchange component of civil works and sewer pipes contracts;
and (e) the foreign costs of consultants' services. The foreign exchange
component of civil works contracts awarded under Loan 547-SI ranged from
about 28 percent to 39 percent, and the weighted average was about 35 percent.
It is, therefore, proposed to disburse 35 percent against civil works and
sewer pipes contracts under this project. An estimated disbursement schedule
.           is in Annex 5.
3.10      Since the project forms part of an on-going program, it is likely
that some contracts included in it will be awarded before the loan is
approved. The awards will be made in accordance with the Bank's procedures
and with its prior concurrence. Disbursements against these contracts will
not be required before the loan becomes effective.
3.11      In the event of there being savings in the loan, the unused balance
would be cancelled.
Ecological Aspects
3.12      The extensions of the sewer system should reduce the number of
housing units using nightsoil collection. The collected sewage will be
given complete treatment and the quality of the effluent from the treatment
plants will be normally equal to or better than the quality of the water in
the receiving streams. No pollution of beaches, fish or shellfish growing
areas will result from the effluent discharges. The digested dried sludge
will continue to be disposed of on land as a fertilizer and soil conditioner.
IV. JUSTIFICATION
4.01      The first project helped to focus attention on the organization
and management of sewerage services in Singapore and has resulted in placing
these services on a self-supporting basis. Operations and maintenance of
facilities have improved and the planning and implementation capabilities of
the Sewerage Department have been strengthened. This second project will
help continue support for the institution building process commenced under
the first loan.
4.02      The sewerage construction program in Singapore is geared to the
construction of housing units and urban renewal schemes under the Government's
development program. The Housing and Development Board plans to construct
30,000 units a year in high rise apartments for lower income groups during
the next five years. The sewerage extensions included in the project are
essential to meet the needs of this expanded housing program and industrial
development in the Island.
4.03      In the older parts of the city and in more sparsely populated
rural areas, liquid wastes are disposed of in septic tanks or collected
through the conservancy system of pail latrines with final disposal into
the sewers. However, these methods are not applicable in concentrated urban



- 6 -
areas to be served by the project, as the multiple-story housing and urban
renewal projects being undertaken result in concentration of population in
these areas for which an adequate sewer system becomes a practical necessity.
4.04      Part of the treated sewage effluent is being used by industries
and the demand is increasing. The use of the treated effluent for toilet
flushing is being tried on an experimental basis in a few housing blocks.
in view of these possible uses for the sewage effluent, the proposed high
degree of treatment of the collected sewage is required (para 2.02). The
treatment proposed is also essential from the point of view of conserving
the quality of water in the streams into which the treated sewage effluents
are discharged and which may be used eventually for water supply purposes.
The method of treatment proposed requires a minimum amount of land which is
an important consideration in Singapore.
4.05      The project areas have been selected on the basis of existing and
projected housing developments and the construction of facilities will be
coordinated with housing in these areas in order to obtain the maximum
benefit from the investments.
4.06      The project is the least cost solution for collection, treatment
and disposal of sewage in the concentrated urban areas of Singapore.
V. THE BORROWER
The Borrower
5.01      As in the case of the loan for the first project, Government of
Singapore will be the borrower. The proceeds of the loan will be applied
exclusively to expenditures on the project described in Chapter III through
the Sewerage Department of the Ministry of the Environment.
The Ministry of the Environment (MOE)
5.02      MOE consisting of two main divisions, the Environmental Health
Division and the Environmental Engineering Division, was created by the
Government of Singapore in September 1972 for the effective coordination of
environmental problems. The former Sewerage Branch of PWD, which was
responsible for carrying out the first project (Loan 547-SI), has been
placed under the Environmental Engineering Division of the new Ministry and
is called the Sewerage Department. An organization chart and a brief des-
cription of the functions of the two divisions of MOE as well as their main
departments and branches are in Annex 6.
The Sewerage Department - Its Organization and Management
5.03      In connection with the first project the Government agreed to
conduct a study of the functions and staff requirements of the Sewerage
Branch of PWD. This study was made by the Organization and Methods Branch



- 7 -
of the Ministry of Finance in 1969. As a result, the Branch (now Department)
was reorganized into three functional sections. An organization chart of SD
is in Annex 7. It is a technical department responsible for planning, design,
construction, operation and maintenance of sewerage services, water pollution
control and waste water reclamation. It maintains facilities for receiving,
treating and disposing of nightsoil collected by the Environmental Health
Department. Plans for construction of minor sewers and secondary treatment
facilities installed by other public agencies or private developers must
be approved by SD. It also operates an industrial water works which supplies
treated sewage effluent to industries for washing, cooling and other indus-
trial purposes. The accounts of SD, like all other Government departments,
are maintained by the Accountant General's Office. In addition, SD maintains
proforma accounts of sewerage operations on a commercial basis (para 5.09).
Most of the billings and collections of sewerage revenues are done by PUB
(para 5.08).
5.04      The organizational changes consequent to the transfer of sewerage
operations from PWD to MOE have had little effect on the administration or
staff of SD. Certain powers relating to sewerage remain vested in the
Director PWD under the Local Government Integration Act. As a temporary
arrangement and until the Act is amended, the Director, Environmental
Engineering Division has been designated Deputy Director PWD to enable him
to exercise those powers.
5.05      The head of SD, a Senior Executive Engineer, is also directly in
charge of construction. He is assisted by a Senior Executive Engineer for
Planning and Design, a Senior Executive Engineer for Operations and Mainte-
nance, a Higher Executive Engineer for the Trade Waste and Sanitary Section,
and a Higher Executive Officer for Administration. The organization study
made under the first loan had recommended that the head of the department
be placed in a grade higher than his assistants and also be relieved of
the direct responsibility for construction. During negotiations, Government
has agreed to relieve the head of the department of the direct charge of
construction and to prepare a plan of action to strengthen SD's administration,
staffing and accounting procedures.
5.06      Although there were some delays in the beginning of construction
of the first project, SD's overall performance on construction supervision
has been good and the sewerage facilities are well operated and maintained.
However, staffing needs to be improved. 22 out of 54 sanctioned posts of
engineers in the department are vacant, and 59, or about 20 percent, of the
technician positions remain unfilled. The shortage of technical personnel
is wide-spread and not limited to SD. The Government is keenly aware of
the problem and has begun the process of making substantial increases in
salary levels. It has also increased the intake of trainees at technical
institutions. SD has attempted to solve the problem to some extent by
recruiting engineers from other countries such as Hong Kong and Sri Lanka
and by extensive employment of consultants for project preparation. But
SD's need for engineers and technicians is bound to increase further with
the proposed large scale expansion of sewerage services in the next five



- 8 -
years. Government has agreed that during the project construction period
MOE will review SD's staffing position annually in consultation with the
Bank to determine measures needed to ensure completion of the project on
schedule.  Special training courses will be organised to improve the
efficiency of SD's personnel.
5.07      The head of SD, appointed in January 1973, is a competent engineer
with considerable experience in the Drainage Branch of PWD. His assistants
are also capable. The management team is qualified, energetic and devoted
and can be relied upon to handle the project efficiently.
Billing and Collection
5.08      Billing and collection of sewage fees are done through PUB which
includes them in its combined monthly bills for electricity, water and gas.
Until March 31, 1970, PUB was given a commission of 5 percent of billing to
cover its costs for billing and collection, as well as for losses due to
tmcollected bills. This has since been reduced to a lump sum of S$ 240,000
per annum, a satisfactory arrangement from SD's point of view. SD itself
bills and collects charges for sale of industrial water, maintenance of
septic tanks, and other services. There are no problems with bad debts.
Accounting
5.09      As a Government Department, SD's accounts are maintained by the
Accountant General's Office of the Ministry of Finance, on a cash basis
customary for Government accounting.  However, in connection with the first
project Government agreed to establish an accounting system on a commercial
basis in order to provide timely information for effective control and
evaluation of the sewerage operations. This has been done, and SD now
maintains commercial accounts on a proforma basis. Assurances have been
obtained that without prior consultation with the Bank, no material modifi-
cations will be made in the accounting system of SD.
5.10      Until recently SD's accounts were slightly delayed, but this problem
will soon be solved because a new accountant has recently been appointed for
SD on a full-time basis. The accounting procedure has not, however, been
~cxc -fied into a manual as yet. During negotiations Government assured that
u Avcounting Manual will be prepared in consultation with the Auditor
-eneral and the Bank to assist SD's saff in compiling its commercial accounts.
5. 11     The question of separating sewerage funds from general Government
funds was discussed during appraisal of the first project in 1968. Govern-
ment, while agreeing to maintain parallel accounts for sewerage operations
on commercial basis, did not conslier the separation necessary.  Experience
siace then indicates that the existing arrangement is satisfactory and,
therefore, no changes are required.
5.12      As a Government Department, SD receives certain free services from
other departments. Examples are -- services provided by State Hospitals,



-9-
Accountant General and the Audit Department. Costs of these services are
not reflected in the accounts of SD. Another element of expenditure not
included is the pension liability for pensionable staff. On the other
hand, SD renders some services free to other Government agencies. The net
effect of this is not known. During negotiations, Government agreed that
SD will establish, in consultation with the Auditor General, estimated values
for such mutual free services and reflect them in its commercial accounts
for 1975 onwards.
5.13      The depreciated value of SD's fixed assets in operation on March 31,
1972 is S$ 128 million. Of this, about S$ 22.7 million or 18 percent represents
the value of assets taken over from the former City Council in 1960, for
which sufficient details are not available in the Assets register. During
negotiations Government agreed to rectify this position.
5.14      Under Loan 547-SI, the Government had agreed to have the accounts
of the Sewerage Branch audited annually by the Government's Director of
Audit or by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank and to furnish
copies of the auditor's reports to the Bank within six months after the end
of the fiscal year. SD's accounts are being audited by the Auditor General
of Singapore. Though there were minor delays in their completion, the
audits have been satisfactory and continuation of this arrangement is
proposed. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that in the
future also SD's accounts will be audited by the Auditor General or by an
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank and the audited financial state-
ments as well as the auditor's report thereon will be furnished to the Bank
within six months after the end of the financial year.
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
General
6.01      SD, as a part of MOE, does not have separate funds or cash balances.
Its revenues are deposited into the Government Treasury and its expenditures
- capital as well as operating - are met from Government budgets. Accounts
are maintained by the Accountant General's office as for other Government
departments.  In addition, SD maintains comercial accounts on a proforma
basis (para 5.09).
Financial Position - Past and Present
6.02      Sewerage services incurred small cash losses (i.e. before depre-
ciation) up to 1965. Including depreciation, the operations showed deficits
up to FY 1970. These deficits were of the order of S$ 3 million every year
in 1962 through 1967, about S$ 1.2 million in 1968 and S$ 0.8 million for
the 15-month period from January 1969 to March 1970. 1/
1/   Fiscal year coincided with the calendar year up to December 31, 1968,
but was changed effective FY 1970 to end with March 31.



- 10 -
6.03      Government's net appropriation 1/ to cover SD's cash losses in
1962 through 1965 and capital requirements through 1970 totalled S$ 64.7
million (US$25.5 million) or an average annual investment of about S$ 8 mil-
lion (US$3 million).
6.04      Since 1970, the financial position of SD has improved considerably.
In March 1970, Government introduced sewage fees based on water consumption
over and above the already applicable charges on sanitary fittings (para
6.11). This increased sewerage revenues substantially and SD achieved in
1971 and 1972 a return of over 8 percent on the net fixed assets in service.
In those two years internal cash generation from sewerage operations amounted
to S$ 28 million which exceeded SD's cash requirements by S$ 8.5 million.
The estimates for 1973 also show a return of 8.7 percent and a net cash
accrual of S$ 2.2 million to Government after meeting SD's requirements.
The financial objective of the first project of putting sewerage services on
a self-supporting basis has thus been fully achieved.
Financing Plan
6.05      The Sources and Application of Funds for the fiscal years 1971 and
1972 and the Estimates and Projections for 1973 through 1983 are in Annex 9.

6.06      The proposed loan of US$12.0 million equivalent does not cover
interest during construction which will be met from operating surpluses.
The loan will be for a period of 20 years including a grace period of about
five years.
6.07      The proposed loan will finance the full foreign exchange component
of the project (estimated at 41 percent of the project cost) or about 32
percent of Singapore's Sewerage Development Program for 1974-79. About 2
percent will come from the current IBRD Loan (Loan 547-SI) for the on-going
project. Internal cash generation will finance the balance of about 66% after
transfer of S$ 21.0 million (US$8.3 million) to Government as a return
against past equity investment. The proposed financing plan is satisfactory.
6.08      During the project construction period, SD's net internal cash
generation after meeting its operating costs and debt service requirements,
(arrived at on proforma basis as though SD were a separate financial entity),
is estimated at S$ 82.6 million. Of this, S$ 61.6 million is assumed as a
source for financing the project (para 6.05) and the balance of S$ 21.0
million as a transfer of funds to Government. SD's cash generation is,
however, notional because operating surpluses are not identified for specific
applications but get merged in the general revenues of Government (para 6.01).
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that Government will make
adequate allocations from its budget for each year and make funds available
to SD, as needed, for meeting capital cost of the project till its completion
and for the recurring costs of sewerage services.
6.09      The proforma Income Statements for the fiscal years 1970 through
1983 and the Sources and Application of Funds statements as well as Balance
Sheets for 1971 through 1983 are in Annexes 8, 9, and 10. The assumptions
for the financial projections are in Annex 11.
6.10      The projections show that sewerage operations will continue to
be financially viable. SD's rate of return on the net value of its fixed
assets in operation will be between 6 percent and 7.3 percent throughout the
period 1974-1983. Its operating ratio before depreciation will be below
40 percent and after depreciation in the range of 54 percent to 62 percent.
The debt service coverage will not be lower than 3.8 times iLn any year up
to 1983. In the ten years, 1974-1983, SD will contribute S$ 27.8 million
(US$10.9 million equivalent) to the Government after meeting its operating
costs, capital expenditures and debt service charges.
Tariffs and Rate Covenant
6.11      Under Loan 547-SI, the Government of Singapore had agreed to make
adjustments in tariffs for sewerage services so as to produce a positive
rate of return not later than 1972. It had also agreed to carry out
before the end of 1971, in consultation with the Bank, a study to determine
a reasonable rate of return for sewerage operations and the nature and
timing of any changes in charges and tariffs which shall be needed to
achieve such rate. With the introduction of sewage fees based on water con-
sumption from March 1, 1970, which almost doubled sewerage revenues in 1971,



- 12 -
the objectives of the agreements were fully realized and a further rate
study was not considered necessary.
6.12      Under the first project, Government undertook to establish by January
1, 1970 a trade waste tariff with charges based on the volume and charac-
teristics of individual industrial wastes and the full cost of their
,llection, treatment and disposal.  Since then, Government has promulgated
rules to regulate the discharge of trade wastes into the sewerage system.
These rules require industries to pre-treat the trade wastes, if necessary,
so that they conform to the prescribed specifications. Because SD's financial
position has improved considerably and the trade wastes do not involve any
additional expenditure to SD, the institution of a separate trade waste tariff
is not considered necessary.
6.13      Fees and charges for sewer services are established by Government
under the Local Government Integration Act. The current tariffs are shown
in Annex 12. The main sources of sewerage revenue are: (i) a fee of S$ 2.00
per month for each sanitary fitting; and (ii) fees of S. cents 4.4 4er m3
for water consumed by domestic consumers and of S. cents 11.0 per m  by
non-domestic consumers. The fees for sanitary fittings apply to all
properties connected to the main sewerage system or to the secondary systems
(with septic tanks or other treatment facilities operated by SD). Those
based on water consumption are payable for all premises to which water is
supplied by PUB. Sewage effluent treated at Jurong Industrial Water Works
is sold to industries at a gradually reducing rate with increase in
consumption. The highest rate is S. cents 16.0 per m3 for consum tion not
exceeding 1,300 m3 per month and the lowest is S. cents 5.0 per m3 for monthly
consumption in excess of 99,300 m . Minor revenues are also derived from
sewer service connection fees, maintenance of septic tanks, sale of sewage
sludge, etc.
6.14      The objective of putting sewerage services on a self-supporting
basis has already been achieved (para 6.04). To ensure SD's continued
financial viability, assurances were obtained during negotiations that
sewerage services will generate sufficient funds to cover operating costs,
including provision for depreciation at reasonable rates, and debt service
charges to the extent they exceed the provision for depreciation. The
current tariffs are adequate and assurances were obtained that unless the Bank
agrees otherwise, Government will maintain its fees and charges for sewerage
services at a level not lower than the present tariffs.  The projections
show that at the existing tariffs, SD will produce an annual financial rate
of return of 6 percent to 7.3 percent on the average net fixed assets in
operation throughout the period 1974-1983.

VII . AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following principal
points:
(a) a plan of action will be prepared to strengthen the
Sewerage Department's administration, staffing and
accounting procedures (para 5.05);
(b) no material modifications in Sewerage Department's
accounting system will be made without prior consult-
ation with the Bank (para 5.09); and
(c) fees and charges for sewerage services will be maintained
at a level not lower than the present tariffs (para 6.14).
7.02      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$12.0 million
equivalent for a term of 20 years including a grace period of five years.

SINGAPORE
SINGAPORE SEWERAGE PROJECT - SECOND STAGE
The Present Sewerage Facilities
The present sewerage facilities are indicated on the map IBRD 10445
and include the additions resulting from the first project.
A.   Sewered Areas- The older built up areas are served by a collection
system of about 400 miles of sewers and pumping mains from 6 inches to 72
inches in diameter. The first project added about 25 miles of main and minor
sewers and pumping mains located in ten areas; two areas in downtown urban
renewal schemes and the other eight on the outskirts of the older built up
city to serve new housing projects. The smaller sewers within the housing
projects are constructed by the Housing and Development Board to the Sewerage
Department's Standards.
B.   Pumping Stations - Because of the low hills in the sewered area, it
is necessary to pump most of the sewage to the two principal treatment works.
The first sewerage project added five pumping stations and improved and
enlarged some of the 23 older ones. The pumping stations are located in
or near the built up areas, and are landscaped and planted to present a
good appearance. The operations and maintenance is very good in order to
prevent complaints.
C.   Treatment Plants utilize the activated sludge process which uses a
minimum of land area and produces a high quality effluent.  The organic
content of the sewage is about 280 mg/l of five-day Bio-chemical Oxygen
Demand (B.O.D.) which is stronger than is usually expected but is probably
due to the campaign to conserve water and not waste it.
1.        The Ulu Pandan plant was completed in 1961 and at that time the
centrally located old Alexandra works were discontinued. The plant takes
sewage from the southern and western part of the urban area. The capacity
of the plant was 24 IMgd which was increased to 30 IMgd with the construc-
tion of additional units under the first loan. The plant generates most
of its power by utilizing digester gas in diesel type engines. The plant
is attractively planted and landscaped, and has an excellent laboratory.
The effluent is discharged to the Jurong river. Part of the effluent is
diverted to the Jurong Industrial Water Works.
2.        The Jurong Industrial Water Works was operated by the Jurong
Town Corporation until June 1, 1971 when it was taken over by the Sewerage
Department. The plant can process 10 INgd but demand is now about 3 IMgd
although it is increasing rapidly. The effluent from Ulu Pandan is



ANNEX 2
Page 2
screened, pre-chlorinated, passed through dual-media filters, aerated and
post chlorinated before being pumped to a system supplying water for
industrial processes and cooling.
3.        The Kim Chuan plant is an older activated sludge plant that has
an average flow of about 30 IMgd and a capacity of 39 IMgd. The older parts
of the plant have recently been improved and upgraded to obtain a better
;>:ality effluent but more modifications are required to get a more adequate
air supply. Gas generated from sludge digestion is the major source of
energy for the plant. The plant receives the sewage from the northern
and eastern parts of the city. The plant is very well maintained. The
effluent from the plant is piped about three miles to discharge into the
Serangoon river about a mile above its mouth. The sludge is pumped about
four miles to the Serangoon sludge disposal plant.
4.        The Serangoon sludge disposal plant is located on the northeast
shore of the Island, near the mouth of the Serangoon river. The sludge
from Kim Chuan is concentrated ia settling basins and then dried on sand-
beds. The dried sludge is all used as a soil conditioner by Government
agencies and private individuals.
5.        A small treatment plant is located near the northeastern tip of
the Island on Telok Paku Road and serves about 10,000 people living in
housing on the former British Army base and in Changi Village.
D.   Secondary Systems - In the outlying areas not reached by the main sewer
system, tnere are about 1,400 small collection systems serving from a few up
to about 200 houses. These use septic tanks or other types of small complete
treatment plants, designed and maintained by the Sewerage Department. The
number of these small systems will gradually decrease as the sewer system
is extended.
E.   Nightsoil Collection - The Environmental Health Department of MOE
operates a nightsoil collection service in the urban areas and the rural
areas are served by private collectors. All nightsoil must be disposed of
into the sewer system collection points established for that purpose.

SINGAPORE
SINGAPORE SEWERAGE PROJECT - SECOND STAGE
Description of the Project
The project includes the following area sewerage schemes; con-
struction of new sewage treatment works; extensions and improvements to
existing treatment works and miscellaneous improvements and extensions (see
Map IBRD 10445).
A.        Sewerage Schemes - Sewer design standards follow British or
Australian practice. The sewer pipes are locally manufactured and are of
good quality. The minimum sewer size is 6 inches. Most pipes are of re-
inforced concrete and up to 27 inches in diameter are made with sulphate
resisting cement or have a high alumina concrete lining. Pipes above 27
inches in diameter have a PVC lining. The minimum design velocity is 2.5
feet per second with the sewer flowing three-fourths full. The minimum
capacity is based on a dry weather flow of 60 gallons per capita per day.
Sewers are designed for three times the dry weather flow. The maximum
spacing of manholes is 300 feet for minor sewers and up to 1,000 feet for
main sewer (12 inches and over) depending upon diameter.
1.   Jurong Industrial Estate:  Main sewers will be provided for
about 9,500 feet along three main roads serving new industrial
sites and associated housing developments. A pressure main
and the first elements of a pumping station will also be
constructed.
2.   Urban Renewal - South:  About 8,000 feet of large PVC lined
sewer pipe will be laid in three major streets in the central
business and residential area south of the Singapore River.
3.   Urban Renewal - North:  Trunk sewers (about 4,500 feet) will
be constructed in three locations to serve a primarily
residential area. The sub-structure of a major pumping station
is now being constructed under the first loan (547-SI) and the
superstructure will be completed as a part of this project.
4.   Kallang Basin:  about 1,500 feet of main sewers in one
location and about 200 feet of trunk connecting sewer will
be constructed to serve a residential and industrial
installation in this urban renewal area.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
5.   Telok Blangah:  This major scheme will provide about
22,000 feet of main sewers and 6,000 feet of minor sewers
plus two main pumping stations and about 8,000 feet of
pressure main to meet the needs of the Telok Blangah
New Town area.
6.   Serangoon and Bartly Road Sub-areas:  About 13,000 feet of
main sewers and 13,000 feet of minor sewers will be
constructed in these two areas to expand the sewer systems
and eliminate a number of existing septic tanks. This will
permit further development of the areas.
7.   Thomson Road:  About 6,200 feet of minor sewers will be
constructed and a subsidiary pumping station in the Thomson
Road and Upper Thomson Road sub-areas. The pumping station
is required for pockets of development where gravity flows
are not possible due to the topography, and will lift the
sewage to the main sewer system.
8.   Upper Changi Estate:  A fourth pump will be provided at the
pumping station and about 1,800 feet of the second rising
main will be constructed to take the increased flow to the
existing sewer along Upper Changi Road.
9.   Queenstown:  About 6,000 feet of minor sewers will be
constructed to serve the housing developments in Queenstown
Neighborhood VII.
10.   East Coast Reclamation:  Sewage services will be provided
for industrial, commercial, residential and recreational
facilities in a strip of reclaimed land from Bedok to
Tanjong Rhu along the East Coast. This stage provides
about 6,600 feet of large trunk sewers, a pumping station
and about 3,200 feet of pressure mains.
11.   Bukit Timah.  About 8,800 feet of main sewers will be
provided for a presently unsewered area. In addition, the
first units of a pumping station will be constructed with
a discharge sewer to the Ulu Pandan treatment works.
12.   Woodlands:  This is a new town area beginning to be developed.
The first sewerage installations will be about 2,200 feet of
trunk sewers, one small pumping station and the first units
of a second pumping station and about 1,000 feet of pressure
mains.
13.   Bedok New Town: This is a cleared area scheduled for rapid
development. About 15,000 feet of main sewers and 4,000
feet of minor sewers are to be constructed, with two pumping
stations and about 11,000 feet of pressure mains to deliver
the sewage to the Kim Chuan treatment works.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
14.   Changi Village Redevelopment:  About 2,000 feet of main and
minor sewers will be constructed to serve a projected
population of about 5,000 in a combined shopping and
residential area. The sewage will be treated in the Telok
Paku Road treatment works.
15.   Ang Mo Kio.  This new town area is scheduled for rapid
housing development. The first sewerage elements required
are about 6,700 feet of main sewers, additional pumping
equipment in two existing pumping stations and about 1,700
feet of additional pressure mains between the two pumping
stations.
B.   Miscellaneous Improvements and Extensions
16.   Extensions of Sewers and Improvements to Pumping Stations:
Outside the area schemes listed above, sewer extensions are
required in several parts of the present system and some
3,000 feet of main sewers and 8,800 feet of minor sewers
are included in the project. Additional equipment and
improvements required at the Paya Lebar, Jurong, Alexandra,
Dunbar Walk and Gilstead Road pumping stations will also be
provided under the project.
17.   The Jurong Industrial Water Works treats some of
the effluent from the Ulu Pandan treatment works so that it
can be used for industrial purposes. Additional equipment is
to be installed to improve the treatment and upgrade the
quality of the industrial water.
C.   Treatment Works - All plants give complete treatment utilizing
the activated sludge process. The sewage treatment plant cost
estimates are based on preliminary designs and the costs of similar
units constructed under the first loan. The consultants are ex-
perienced in treatment plant design and the results obtained during
the first loan have been satisfactory.
18.   Ulu Pandan:  This plant will take additional quantities of
sewage as the area sewerage schemes are developed, particularly
from the Bukit Timah area. A feasibility study is now underway
to determine the necessary renovations and extensions. The
project includes the first units of the proposed extensions,
yet to be defined, and necessary umdifications to the existing
plant.
19.   Kim Chuan and Serangoon:  The principal treatment works are
at Kim Chuan and the sludge treatment facility is at Serangoon.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
(a) Improvements. Initially, Kim Chuan treatment plant
was not designed to treat the sewage to meet today's
higher quality requirements. Many modifications and
considerable additional equipment are now required to
enable the old plant to meet present standards of 20
mg/l of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and 30 mg/l of
suspended solids in the final effluent. The standards
that the plant was originally designed to meet were
50 mg/l of BOD and 50 mg/l of suspended solids.
(b) Extensions. Due to accelerated development of public
housing units and the continuous expansion of the sewer
systermi, it will be necessary to double the capacity of
the Kim Chuan plant over the long term. Included in the
project are the first units of this expansion.
20.   Woodlands:  A new treatment plant will be constructed to serve
the Woodlands, Kranji, Lim Chu Kang and Chua Chu Kang areas of
Singapore in the north-central part of tine Island. The first
stage of this plant will be completed to serve an estimated
75,000 people, in Woodlands New Town and Kranji industrial
estate.
21.   Changi:
(a) Village Area. The Telok Paku Road treatment facility
will not be able to handle the increased sewage load.
Two package plants will be installed adjacent to the
present plant. These new units will be completely self-
contained and capable of meeting the effluent standards.
Each unit will be able to treat the sewage of 3,000
people.
(b) Bedok Works. This will be a new major treatment plant
to serve the eastern part of the Island. The excess
sludge will undergo digestion and vacuum filtration
before disposal. The effluent will be discharged into
the Sungei Ketapang channel. The effluent may be used
for industrial purposes. If required, a short marine
outfall may be added when the plant begins to reach its
ultimate capacity. Included in this project is the first
stage of the plant. The construction schedule of the
entire plant will be geared to the housing development.
22.   Jurong:  This will also be a new major treatment works serving
the western part of the Island including much of the Jurong
industrial area. The works will be constructed in stages, with
an ultimate capacity for a population equivalent of about 600,000
persons. Consultants will be engaged for the planning and design
of the -works and the first stage will be constructed under the
project. This plant will treat some of the sewage that is now
going to the Ulu Pandan plant.

23.   Seletar;  This site will provide for a major plant to treat
the sewage from an area that is largely undeveloped at the
present time. Consulting engineers will be appointed to
undertake a feasibility study and design of the works. The
first stage will be required toward the end of the project
period.

SINGAPORE
SINGAPORE SEWERAGE PROJECT - SECOND STAGE
Assumptions for Financial Projections
REVENUE
1.   Water Borne Sewage Fees
(a) Based on Fittings:
The average number of fittings for 1973 is about 373,300
(Goverment 25,000; non-government 348,300). Based on the
Housing Development Board's program of constructing about
25,000 to 30,000 housing units every year, and a small
increase for private buildings, the number of additional
fittings has been assumed at 29,000 in 1974, 30,000 annually
in 1975 through 1978 and 36,000 annually in 1979 through
1983. For Government buildings a uniform increase of
S$ 10,000 (about 400 fittings) every year has been assumed
through 1983. Revenue has been worked out at the current
rate of S$ 2.00 per fitting per month.
(b) Based on Water Consumption:
Public Utilities Board's projections of water sales to con-
sumers subject to levy of sewage fees show an annual increase
of about 7 percent in 1974 through 1983. In view of the
recent increase in water tariffs and PUB's "save water"
campaign, this assumption appears optimistic and therefore
for the purposes of projecting sewerage revenues, a
conservative rise of only 4% pa during 1974-1979 and
5 percent thereafter has been assumed.
2.   Sale of Industrial Water
Sewage effluent treated at Jurong Industrial Water Works,
taken over by the Sewerage Department effective June 1971 is supplied to
industries. Sales are projected to increase 25% annually in FY 1974, 1975
and 1976 and 10% thereafter through 1983. By that time the plant is expected
to be utilized to its full capacity.
3.   Other Revenue
Other revenue includes connection fees, septic tank maintenance
fees, supervision fees, sale of sludge, etc. Due to expansion of sewerage
system, special connection fees collected from developers of housing



ANNEX 1 1
Page 2
estates are estimated to come down. Revenue is projected to decrease to
S$ 1.37 million in FY 1974, S$ 1.20 million in 1975 and remain constant at
S$ 1 million anually thereafter.
OPERATING COSTS
4.   Salaries, Vages and Allowances
The components of salaries, wages and allowances and projected
estimates for each are as under:

(a)  Estimates of salaries for FY 1974 include 5% for normal
increments, 10% for revision in salary scales, S$ 195,000
towards compensation for reduction in leave entitlements
and S$ 135,000 for additional staff. Normal increments
and additiona:L staff at the same rates are assumed for
FY 1975 through 1978 and normal increments thereafter
through 1983.
(b) Labor wages are projected to increase 5% pa.
(c) Overtime is estimated at 12% of the labor wages. Monthly
rated staff are not eligible for overtime.
(d) Provident Fund contributions are based on 5% of salaries
and 12% of wages.
(e) Traveling expenses are assumed to increase 10% annually.
5.        Fuel and Power costs are projected to go up in proportion to the
volume of sewage handled and increase in fuel and power rates.  Sewage
volume is estimated to increase 10% in FY 1974, 13% in 1975 and in 1976,
11% in 1977 and 6/% in 1978 through 1983. Rate increases already announced
by Public Utilities Board are estimated to raise costs by 30% in 1974. A
further increase of 10% is assumed in 1979.



ANNEX 11
Page 3
6.        Materials and Supplies are also assumed to increase in cost in
proportion to the volume of sewage handled plus a 4% increase due to price
escalation.
7.        Repairs and Maintenance by Contractors and Other Expenses are
estimated to go up 5% annually.
8.        Depreciation has been worked out at 2.5% on the gross value of
fixed assets in operation at the beginning of the year.
SOURCES AND APPLICATION OF FUNDS STATEMENT AND BALANCE SHEETS
9.        Borrowings:
The IBRD loan for the Second Sewerage Project for each year is
assumed equal to the estimated foreign exchange expenditure with a time lag
of three months between payments by Sewerage Department and disbursements
by IBRD.
10.       Debt Service assumes the following terms for the IBRD Loan of
S$ 30.5 million (US$12.0 million):
Period of Loan            20 years
Grace Period               5 years
Rate of Interest           7.25%
Commitment Fee             0.75%
11.       Transfers to Government:
Since the Sewerage Department has no separate cash balance of its
own, the surplus cash generation is assumed to be a transfer to Government,
and a decrease in equity.
12.       Accounts Receivable are projected to comprise about two months
collections through Public Utilities Board, three months revenue from sale
of industrial water and S$ 100,000 for other items.
13.       Inventories are assumed to increase by about 10% annually partly
to cover increases in prices and partly for larger quantities.
