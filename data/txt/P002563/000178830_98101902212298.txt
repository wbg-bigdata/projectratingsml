INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOYMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT T0 THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE SJDAN FOR A THIRD PAILWAY PROJ WET
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Democratic Republic of the Sudan for the equivalent
of $24 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project to improve the
railways and assist in meeting other urgent transport requirements of the
country. US$17.24 million will be relent to the Sudan Railways Corporation
(SRC) at an interest rate of 7-4 percent for 25 years including four years grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission from the Bank visited the Sadan in
November/December 1971 and its report entitled "The Economic Development
and Prospects of the Sudan" (Report, No. AE-27, in four volumes, dated
June 9, 1972) was distributed on June 30, 1972 (R72-179).    This was the firs
full economic mission to the Sudan after a lapse of several years but, owing
to continued political unrest in the southern part of the country at that
time, the mission's coverage was limited to northern Sudan. In March 1972
the Government reached an agreement (The Addis Ababa Accord) with the southern
dissident elements, as a result of which peace returned to the south and a
Southern Regional Government was established in Juba with a large measure of
autonomy.  At this time, the Bank was requested to assist the reconstruction
and develormer1t of the Southern Region wh-ich had suffered much phys-cal
destruction during the prolonged strife. A special economic mission visitea
the Region in November/December 1972, and its report on development problems
and prospects in the Region was distributed on June 25, 1973 (R73-159)
(Report No. 119a-SU, dated June 1, 1973).    Country data are attached as
Annex I.
3.        The Sudan has an area of one million sq. miles and as such is the
largest country in Africa. Much of the land is unoccupied. The soils of
the Sudan are sandy in the northern third of the country, clay in the central
third and lateritic in the southern third. According to the 1955/56 census
the population totalled 10.4 million and with a rate of growth of 2.8 percent
per year, the population at present would be about 17 million. Per capita
GNP is estimated at US$120 and the Sudan is included in the UN list of
Twenty-Five Least Developed Countries.
4.        The Ihite Nile and the Blue Nile have endowed parts of the cournry
with an abundance of water which has enabled it to develop the biggest
irrigation system in tropical Africa. While the gudan has increased its
utilization of the Nile water to 11.7 milliard m,    it still has not reached
its 18.5 milliard m.3 specified in the Nile Water Agreement with Egypt.
Rainfall varies fron about 20mm. in the arid northernmost parts of the
country to 1500mm. in the south. The Sudan thus has a considerable supply
of unutilized water in addition to about 200 million feddansi/ of land
1/   1 feddan = 1.038 acres



-2-
su ta;cle ;or crop and pasto--  farmning.  Unlikse in many developing countries,
-.0 e        -i o po ulatiori pressure on presently developed land and,_ ndeed, in some
ts o-the Sudan  a shortag;e of labor has limited the expansion of agri-
tual production.   As the cultivated area amoun's to no more than 10 per-
_rl o' LIe potentially cult_vable land, for the foreseeable future the avall-
-land will not 'e a limiting factor to the expansion cf agricultural
,oas oral activities.
The Sudanese economy is based largely on cotton.   It is an important
^crducer of long and extra-long staple cotton, and also of gum, sesame and
--ournanuts.  Its considerable lives-ock resources have hardly been tapped.
Tne manuracturing sector is relatively small and, apart from the processing
of some agricultural commodities, it is limited to the production of consumer
goods and some building materials.   There is some potential for mining (chrome,
iron ore and copper).  There have been some exports of chrome ore and the
:easibility of developing tne iron and copper deposits needs to be thoroughly
nves-igated. The inadecuacy olf transport could prove to be the biggest
bottleneck not only in the development of the mining sector cut also in
economic development in general.
6.        Transport in the Sudan is still focussed essentially on its railways.
Sudan Railways have a total route of about 4,750 lan, all of which is an un-
ballasted single-track railway. The railway was originally built for
administrative purposes and "or opening the country, but has performed a very
valuable economic function by carrying the countryrs steadily rising imports
and exports.  however, under the pressure of growing traffic and the inadecuate
utilization of the present stock of locomotives and rolling stock, the railwaysr
capacity is becoming severely strained.   Recently some successful efforts have
been made to improve the railwaystoperating efficiency.   The road system is
virtually non-existent, there being a total of only 300 km of bitumenized roads
outside municipal limits.   The fact that some traffic does move by road reflects
not so much the suitability of roads but the considerable difficulty of getting
wagon space on the railway. IWile River transport could play a more important
role than at present.   improving domestic air transport will require signilficant
investments to imaprove the domestic airports and in particular to provide night
landing facilities which are now available only at Khartoum.
7.        Compared with most other countries in Africa, the Sudan has less of a
problem with regard to the availability of high-level manpower. This is
attributable in part to the fact that the educational systerm has evolved over a
longer period.  One of the features of the system is that, although the n-umber
of children in elementary and secondary scnools is still small in relation to
their total age group a high proportion. progress to universities and other
institutions ofL higher learning and enrollment in them has increased rapidly.
There has indeed been a growing problem in absorbinrg some of the output of the
educational system, particularly university graduates with general arts degrees.
The government has in the past stood ready, as a matter of policy, to hire all
university graduates needing jobs, but this clearly entails considerable waste.
There is an urgent need to proceed with the proper planning of the educational
system so as to make it more responsive to the requirements of economic development.



- 3 -
8.        The public sector has long been dominant in the Sudanese economy.
It embraces all modern irrigation facilities, the railways and virtually all
power and water supply. After the nationalization measures of 1970/71, a
significant proportion of industry, commerce and finance was also transferred
to the public sector, so that an estimated 50 percent of the GDP is now
generated within this sector.
9.        During the period 1965-72, the Sudanese economy was characterized
by low growth, bordering on stagnation. It suffered from a declining level
of investment - private and public - a marked decline in external assistance,
excessive monetary expansion resulving in complete depletion of its net foreign
assets and in inflationary price increases. The main reason for this poor
performance - despite relatively favorable conditions - was the preoccupation
of the government with acute political problems, among which was the problem
of dissidence in the south which not only divided the country but was a drain
on its resources.
10.       The 1971 Bank economic mission concluded that the country's economic
stagnation could be overcome if the Government were to increase public savings so as
to make possible the financing of investment magnitudes comparable at least to
the levels achieved in the early 1960s. This could be achieved by curtailing
the growth of recurrent expenditures which have been increasing faster than
revenues. The IMF has had a series of stand-by arrangements with the Sudan,
the latest of which covering the period up to July, 1974,provides 24 million
SDRs. In both the IMPF's consultations and the Bank mission's discussions
with the government, specific recommendations have been made regarding budgetary
and fiscal measures needed to improve the economic situation; the stand-by
agreement with the IMF stipulates credit ceilings and hence acts as a check on
unbridled increases in public sector expenditures. Moreover, with the success-
ful solution to the internal strife in the south and with the adoption of the
new Constitution, it is felt that the government has the opportunity of turning
its full attention to the tasks of development.
11.       The key problem of the Sudanese economy is the low level of
investment which is causing the present stagnation and hence the most important
task is to step up the volume of investment and to ensure its financing in a
manner which will not lead to a serious debt burden. It is estimated that to
increase GNP at 4 percent per year in real terms over the period 1973-77 which
would be a very modest target, considering the population growth rate of 2.8
percent - would require minimum investment of the order of US$ 250 million per
annum. If half of this is financed by private sources, as is the government's
hope and expectation, public sector investment would have to increase to US$ 125
million per annum from its present level of US$ 81 million. This would be a
sharp increase in public sector development expenditure but it is no more, in
monetary terms, than was achieved in the early 1960s. Considering the general
price increase over the last decade, such a level of public investment would
in real terms still be less than what was achieved ten years ago.
12.       Assuming the public sector can increase its volume of annual
development expenditures, the problem is to mobilize domestic and external
resources to finance such a level of expenditures. At present public savings
are not adequate to finance even half of the projected level of development
expenditures and the potential for a sharp improvement in the near future is
slim. Consequently the level of public sector investment in the Sudan over
the next few years will be to a great extent a function of the inflow of
externa2 assistance.



To ste-D u  the level of investment and to mobilize internal and
ex.,ernal rescurces reQuires an adecuate pannirg mechanism and procedures.
- erefore, th.e 3ank is executing a planrning project financed by the INMDP
st-rengthren rthe central planning organization in the country.  The Bank
_- a-so sending a mission to review the statistical system of the Sudan and
', prepare a plar to fill the gaps in it.  This should result in further
(-3...verents in the planning and evaluation functions.
IL.       The financial and administrative problems of the public sector
preclude a sharp increase in its development program in the short run.
T'herefore, the role of the private sector in maintaining growth is crucial.
Although the public sector plays a major role, historically the attitude
towards private investment has at most times been favorable. The decline in
private activity since 1965 was mainly due to the unstable political environ-
ment and the feeling of uneasiness ifollowing the nationalization and confis-
cation measures of 1970 and 1971. The government has taken the necessary steps
to settle the comnpensation claims, has returned some confiscated property and
has enacted Legislation providing incentives and guarantees for private enter-
prises - foreign and local.
15.       A: the end of 1971, the Sudan's total exterral public debt was
US$ L78.9 million equivalent, including undisbursed commitments of US$ 137.h
mlIlion.  The breakdown of the total debt outstanding by source shows that
the Bank Group, Arab bilateral sources and China are the three principal
creditors with shares of 27.6, 22.3 and 18.5 percent respectively.  Debt
service payments on long-term debts amounted in 1971 to 12.1 percent of the
value of exports of goods and non-factor services.
16.       The Sudan's capacity to serv-ice additional loans on conventional
terms over the next few years is severely limited by its budgetary and foreign
exchange position which are likely to remain strained for some time.  The
Central Govermment current surplus which averaged about Ls 8 million a year in
the period FY-1962-71 has turned into an increasing deficit, reaching Ls 17
million in FY73.  While the Sudan has a good record in meeting its recayment
obligations, such obligations over the next few years will strain the avail-
ability of foreign exchange, particularly if full account is taken of the
transfer of the compensation payments forI the nationalized assets.  Sudan's
export earnings are expected to grow at the modest rate of 3.5 percent annually,
but being heavily dependent on cotton production, they are subject to fluctuation
on account of weather, pests and international prices. The net foreign reserves
of the country have been depleted since 1968 and at present they stand at a
negative figure of US$l15 million.  Imports, partic-ularly of capital goods
have to expand in propbrtion to the projected increase in investment, private
and public. Therefore, while a rapid increase in private and public capital
inflow is essential, it is paramount that the terms of public capital inflow
should be as soft as possible.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE SUDAN
17.       Since the Sudan's independence in 1956, the Bank Group has helped
finance various development projects with commitments totalling $214.5 million
and has been the country's largest source of foreign aid. A major portion of
our past lending was to help finance irrigation and railway projects; in
addition we also helped with one power project and an education project. Annex
II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments
as of October 31, 1973 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
18.       While no loans or credits were made to the Sudan between September
1968 and June 1972, largely because of the government's failure to take
measures necessary to overcome its economic difficulties, we believe the
situation is improving. The government has given more attention to the
resolution of its domestic economic and political problems. The ending of
the conflict in the south has been a major achievement. Although it is bound
to add to the immediate development resource requirements of the country, there
should be some offsetting reductions in military expenditures. The financial
measures taken under the continuing stand-by arrangements with the IMF are
further evidence of the government's determination to find solutions to the
Sudan's pressing problems. These initial steps and the pressing needs of the
south are strong justification for more active Bank Group operations in the
Sudan.
19.       Our economic missions have enabled us to prepare detailed analyses
of the major economic sectors and identify several high priority projects, some
of which could be suitable for Bank Group lending. While the Southern Region
has special rehabilitation recuirements, it is evident that our lending strategy,
for the country as a whole, in the near future should continue to emphasize
agriculture and transportation, which hold the key to increasing both production
and exports, and should support the revitalization of industry. The Rahad
Project approved in March 1973 is a major irrigation project which is expected
to help agriculture significantly. The recently approved credit for the Industrial
Bank of Sudan will help reactivate the private industrial sector. Transportation
will benefit by the present project designed to improve rail transport and certain
related transport facilities. In preparation for the near future are further
power and highway projects, a domestic aviation project and a project for
agricultural rehabilitation in the Southern Region.
20.       In response to a specific request by the Sudanese government to re-
activate the Consultative Group for the Sudan which, established in 1963, has
been largely dormant since 1964, a meeting of the Consultative Group was held in
July. Most of the original member countries as well as some new countries
participated in the meeting and expressed positive interest in helping the Sudan.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
21.       Improvement of the transport network is indispensable to economic growth
in the Sudan which, with an area of 2.5 million so. km., is the largest country
in Africa   (see map).  The terrain is essentially flat with a vast desert in the
north, a large clay plain in the center and tropical forests and savannas in the
south.



- 6 -
One of the world's largest swamps, the Sudd, separates the central portion
of the country from the southern region which is linked only by the Nile
River system to the rest of the country.   The population of about 17 million
is relatively densely distributed along some stretches of the river banks
and close to the capital, Khartoum, at the confluence of the White and Blue
Niles.  However, scattered centers of population exist in almost all regions
of the country with the exception of the desert tracts in the northwest.
Agriculture continues to be the country's major economic activity, presently
accounting for about 40 percent of the gross domestic product and almost all
export earnings.  With the expansion of agriculture to new areas, the average
distance crops must travel from areas of production to those of consumption
and for export has been increasing and will continue to increase steadily.
The harsh climate and long distances make the provision of cheap, efficient
and reliable transport particularly difficult, but such facilities are
essential if the country's major potential for agricultural development is to
be realized.
Transport Modes
22.       The railway is the primary transport mode, both for moving produce
to Port Sudan for export and for distributingj imports to domestic consumers
?.oad and rivcr transport serve as feeders to the railway. The government has
begun to devote more attention to road development. With the settlement of
the southern problem, river transport is bound to become more important in
serving the southern areas of the country.   Aviation has presently only a small
share of total transport but, with growing economic development, should become
increasingly important for rapid passenger service as distances are great and
surface travel is time-consuming. Port Sudan, on the Red Sea, is the country's
only important deep-water seaport.   The expected increase in traffic may strain
its capacity and proposals to improve port facilities are being considered by
the government.  Some immediate requirements for the port are included in the
present project.
Planning and Coordination
23.       The F77O-FY75 Development Plan as originally drawn up was not much
more than a listing of uncoordinated projects proposed by various ministries,
and the government has since decided to review and revise the Plan arnnually.
The review mechanism, however, continues to be handicapped by inadecuate
planning efforts,   and in the case of the transport sector, this has meant a
low level of investment in co,caxison with needs. As a result transport is be-
coming a major constraint to current economic activity as well as to plans for
raising future levels of production, especially in agriculture. The government
has -_,Iized that transport planning has become critically urgent and both the
ongoing highwa- project and the present project contain components for studies
to help transport planning and coordination.
24.       The coordination of transport modes in the Sudan, unlike some other
countries, is not an immediate problem since most transport services in the
country are complementary. The only duplication at present is between Khartoum
and Wad Medani (185 km) where a paved road parallels the railway.   In the future,
specific issues on which well-informed decisions would be needed are (a) a pro-
posal to continue new road construction between Wad Medani and Port Sudan over
the next few years, and (b) the proper relative roles of rail and river services



- 7 -
linking the rest of the country to the Southernr Region, itself in need of
more feeder connections.  The government has recently decided to construct,
with Kuwaiti financing, a pipeline to carr- whi-te ol- from the refinery at
Port Sudan to Khartoum. When completed in 1970, the pipeline will reduce
much of the bulk netroleun traffic on the railway on its Port Sudan-Khartoum
line. Fowever, this is not expected to affect the Sudar RailNws Corporation's
finances seriously arn the railway will still have to move substantial volumes
of oil from Khartoum to the rest of the country.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       A repcrt entitled "Appraisal of the Third Railway Project - Sudan't
(No. 253-SUa, dated Niovember 3D', 1973) is being circulated separately.  A
Credit and Project Summary is provided in Annex I1I.
26.       The project was appraised in December 1972 and negotiations were
held in Washington in November 1973.   The Sudanese delegation was led by Dr.
Nasreldin Mubarak, Director General of the National Planning Commission, and
included Mr. Wasfi, General Manager of the Sudan Railways Corporation.
27.       Few countries in the world still rely so heavily on their railways
as the Sudan. Until the establishment by statute of the Sudan Railways
Corporation (SRG) in 1967, the Sudan Railway was a government department
under the Minister of Communications and was responsible not only for the
railway but also for Port Sudan, Nile steamer services and a number of hotels
and rest houses. In 1971 the railway hotels were turned over to a newly
created Hotels Corporation and in mid-1Q72 the new River Transport Corporation
took over the steamer services. Port Sudan, though almost wholly a rail-served
port, will shortly be set up as a separate organization. With the roads in an
early stage of development and artiouated river services, both of which serve
as feeders to the rail system rather than offering alternatives to it. the
railway is by far the most important mears of transport on the trunk routes.
Covering a length of about 4,750 km, the railway track capacity is potentially
adequate to meet traffic demands expected for a long time to come. The long
distances to be covered and the density of bulk traffic on the trunk routes are
such that a properly ran railway system would definitely have clear economic
advantages over other modes of transport. However, inefficient operations
combined in particular with a shortage of motive power and an inadequate
commrunications system, have reduced the effective capacity cf the railways in
the Sudan to such an extent that it represents a major constraint to the
economic development of the country.
28.       The proposed project will be the Bank Group's third lending operttion
for the Sudan Railways. The first loan (202-SEU, 1958) of $39 million and a
second loan (440-SEU, 1965) of $31 million helped finance the railways' 1059-60
and 1966-68 development programs respectively. Though there were delays in
implementation, both projects were completed satisfactorily. The present
project is designed essentially to improve the railways' operational standards
and to provide the capacity needed to meet expanding travel demands on the
trunk rouutes. Efforts to improve the railways do not detract from the need to
develop other transport modes in the country, and the rroposed project includes
equipment, studies and technical assistance designed to assist river transport
and civil aviation, as well as measures to improve operations in Port Sudan.



£ ,       SSRC1s investrrent program as originally drawn up under the
-:'71-Y75 Development Plan was Ls 15.0 million comprising 's l4.i million
or railways, Ls 0.1 million for Port Sudan and Ls 0.9 million for river
-bransport, since separated from SRC.  The Bank's 1971 economic mission
.uggested that these allocations were far short of reouirements if forecast
-Ca2 affc d4emands were to be met.  In consultation with the Bank Group the
Government and SRC have prepared a revised Investment Plan envisaging a total
investment in railways and ports of Ls 30 million over the five-year period.
The proposed IDA project will include the last three years of SRC's development
program under the Plan. The physical investm,ents proposed are track renewaL
consisting of timber sleeper replacements, drainage improvements, siding
installations and the beginning of replacement of existing track by heavier
rails on some of the branch lines. Minor additions and improvements to
railway buildings and workshops and to workshop equipment are included.
Measures to be taken will also include the improvement of communications
equipment for better traffic operations and train control.   On the basis of
expected traffic the requiremnents of locomiotives have been assessed and as a
step toward ultimate elbiination of steam traction, the project provides for
rehabilitation of tne existing diesel fleet and for buying a further 10
main-line and 20 shunting diesel locomotives.   The proposed project also
includes the purchase of new, and imlprovement of existing, rolling stock to
meet the expected increase in freight and passenger traffic.   At Port Sudar.
the proposed project would improve facilities by providing cargo handling
equipment and additional storage.
30.       The technical assistance components in the project include the
establishment of a new railway training schoo:L at Atbara as recommended
in a recent ILO report. Also included would be technical assistance for
improvement of Port Sudan operations and a study of the long-term port
development requirements.   In view of the increasing importance of river
and air transport, the project also provides for technical assistance
to the recently created River Transport Corporation to ensure coordination
with railway services and tc increase the efficiency of river fleet opera-
tions, particularly in the South. Similarly the project also includes
the services of consultants to undertake engineering and economic analyses
for the development of airports in the Southern Region and at Port. Sudan
with a view to these pre-investment studies becoming the basis for a future
airport construction project suitable for Bank Group financing.   Consequent
on the Auditor General Chambers Act of 1970 the Auditor General's respon-
sibilities have been greatly expanded and made to include all oublic works
and corporations. To meet the greatly increased work load additional staff
has been recruited and some senior officers are being trained under an
arrangement with the Egyptian Governrnent.  However, to avoid delays in the
completion of the audits of public corporations, including those of SRC,
it is desirable to include in the proposed project financing for additional
training programs for the Auditor Gerneral's staff.

Cost Estimates
31.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $79.7 million, of
which the foreign exchange component would be $44.1 million. The cost
estimates are based on recently received quotations and bids, updated for
1973 prices, together with estimated local taxes. Contingencies have been
provided for all items not yet covered by firm contracts on the basis of
a physical contingency allowance of about 5 percent and a price contingency
of about 10 percent per year. The cost of technical assistance has been estimated
on the basis of man-month requirements and recent experience in the Sudan.
Financing
32.       The proposed IDA credit of US$24.0 million will meet about 30
percent of the total project costs and about 54 percent of the foreign
exchange costs. The balance of the foreign exchange cost will be met by
credits from various foreign sources, with the local costs and taxes being
met by SRC and the Government. The proposed financing pattern for the project
is summarized below:

33.        The British credit i s to rehabilitate and improve 55 English
Electric locomotives supplied from Britain between 1961 and 1963. The
existing credit from the Federal Republic of Germany is for (i) 10 main
line diesel locomotives for which bodies, frames and bogies are to be
built in Germany, with diesel engines and electrical transrrissions being
supplied by General Electric, successors to English Electric, in Britain,
so as to continue standardi zation of this equipment which has proved
suaccessful in the Sudan; and (ii) 20 diesel hydraulic shunting locomotives
to be obtained from Germany for which a second long-term credit has been
been agreed in principle. Tne ADB's first and second loans are to
finance freight wagons and underframes for coaches and service vehicles to be
procured on the basis of international competitive bidding. The contract
under the first ADB loan has been placed in Spain and a Spanish supplier's
credit has been obtained tc, finance the balance of the foreign cost.
34.       Of the total amomnt of the proposed IDA credit of $24.0 million a
total of $17.24 million equivalent will be relent by the Government to SPRC on
normal Bank terms with SRC assuming the foreign exchange risk. The balance
will be retained by the Government to cover the foreign exchange costs of
equipment and technical assistance for Port Sudan operations, river services,
airport studies and training of the Auditor C-eneral's staff.
Procurement and Disbursement
35.       Imported ecuipment f inanced by the proposed IDA credit will be
obtained through international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA
guidelines. Items covered will be workshop machinery and handling equipment,
commuT;nications and train control equipment, roller bearings and draw-gear
for rolling stock, components for about 620 freight wagons, e-quipment for the
new railway training school, equipment and material for Port Sudan, and oil
barges. Retroactive financing of about $250,000 is proposed for meeting the
starting cost of airport stttdies undertaken after November 1, 1973.
36.       The SRC contribution will cover the local cost of its investment
program including customs iduties and exchange taxes on all imported goocs.
The Government, however, has agreed to defer payment of the customs duties
($l3.-,4 million ecuivalent) by SEC unt-l 1977.
37.       Disbursements from the -DA credit will be made on the basis of
the c.i.?. . cost at Port Sudan of imported equipment and materials and of
the foreign cost of consulting and technical services.
Fro j0ec,G Execution
:o.       The Ministry of Transport will have overall responsibility for
execution of the project and for coordinating the work of the other
ministries and departments concerned with parts of the project.  SEC is
competent to carry out all parts of the project with which it is directly
concerned and will be provided technicaL assistance on railway operations.
For this purpose, under a UNDP project the Australian CommorLwealth Railways
have sent a team of experts with practical railway operating experience
under desert conditions comparable to those in the Sudan. As improvement



- 11 -
of the railways' operating efficiency is fundamental, a number of operational
targets have been agreed and a system of monitoring will be established to
permit regular evaluation of progress. Suitable consultants will also be
engaged for technical assistance connected with Port Sudan and the airport
pre-investment studies. Similarly, appropriate technical assistance will
also be obtained for starting the new railway training school and to advise
the River Transport Corporation.
SRC's Finances
39.       SRC had operating surpluses from railway and port services over
the 1968-1972 period, but incurred annual deficits from river and hotel
services which resulted in small net losses in 1968 and 1969 for the
corporation as a whole. The financial situation improved in 1970 with
increases in traffic which more than offset cost increases, and overall
surpluses were achieved in subsequent years. Responsibility for the hotel
services was transferred to a separate corporation on December 1, 1971, and a
similar transfer was made of river steamer services on July 1, 1972.   SRC's
main financial problem has been with receivables, largely from government
departments and public corporations. The Bank Group has repeatedly stressed
the need for settling these accounts and the Government has agreed to take
measures to ensure prompt monthly settlement of accounts for services rendered
by SRC after February 1974 and settle the overdue accounts by June 1977.
The Government and SRC have, in the light of increasing costs, agreed to
implement overall tariff increases of about 16 percent. In order to ensure
that SRC's cash position would remain satisfactory it was agreed that until
the Closing Date of the proposed credit, SRC would limit major investments
to those included in the project and take steps to achieve by fiscal 1975
a return of at least 6 percent per annum on net fixed assets in use. The
financial implications of the recent sharp increase in petroleum fuel prices
will be kept under review.
Economic Justification
40.       The main justification for the proposed project is that it would
enable SRC to carry the forecast increases in traffic which would otherwise,
largely, not move at all since on all important routes, especially the Port
Sudan - Khartoum corridor, there is now virtually no other effective means
of transport. This project is also expected to permit reductions in operating
and maintenance costs mainly of locomotives, and in the case of Port Sudan,
to provide the needed additional capacity to meet growing traffic requirements.
The estimated economic return for various components of the project ranges
from 12 to 22 percent. The whole program has a satisfactory minimum economic
return of 14 percent.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AIJTHORITY
41.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Democratic
Republic of the Sudan and the Association, the draft Project Agreement
between SRC and the Association, the recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association
and the text of a draft ResoLution approving the proposed credit are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.   The draft Development
Credit and Project Agreements conform substantially to the pattern of the
Association's agreements for transportation development projects.
42.       I am satisfied thatl the proposed development Credit and Project
Agreements would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
43.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
The Bank and IDA have so far made six loans and five credits to
the Sudan.  Disbursements are in progress or will shortly commence for
five projects.
Loan No.522 Power Project; US$19.0 Million Loan of January 15, 1i68;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973
The 1968 loan to the Central Electricity and Water Corporation
(CEWC), a semi-autonomous government agency, was for a power project
comprising a 90 MW hydroelectric powerhouse at Roseires, related transmission
lines and substations, as well as management consulting services. The project
is now completed, but accounting and administrative inadequacies of the CEWC
continue to require special attention of supervision missions. The project
has successfully made additional power available to the Khartoum area.
Credit No.122 Education Project; US$8.5 Million Credit of June 24, 1968;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Major elements of the project are about 36 months behind schedule.
Delays have been caused by belated appointment of consultant architects,
difficulties in establishing project implementation procedures, weaknesses
in management, excessively high quotations received for construction items
necessitating re-tendering of certain project institutions, difficulties in
obtaining deliveries of materials, and late arrival of technical assistance
personnel. Although these problems were to a large extent beyond the
control of the Project Units, their capability to deal with problems has
improved. Extensions of the Closing Date and cost overruns are likely.
The project should continue to be monitored closely.
Credit No.311 Mechanized Farming Project; US$11.25 Million Credit of
June 12, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 197H
The first mechanized farming project (Loan 556-Su) to e<tablisn
about 1L40 farms of 1000 feddans each (I feddan = 1.038 acres) was completed
in July 1971, one year ahead of schedule and with substantial savings.
Ehccuraged by this success the area of the original project was extended
by 75,00' feddans and a sec3nd mechanized farming project covering a further
420O000 feddans was approves for which Credit 311-SU was signed on June 12,
1972. The Credit became effective on April 24, 1973. Efforts are being
. zAto speed up the allotment of farms.
I/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encourtered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengtns and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 3 of 3
Credit No.331 Highway Project; US$7.0 Million Credit of September 29, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project comprises assistance to the Department of Roads (DOR)
in improving its organization, in preparing a highway betterment and
maintenance program and purchases of related equipment spares and materials.
Also included are feasibility studies of about 500 km of roads followed by
detailed engineering of about 350 km and technical assistance to the Ministry
of Transport in transport planning and training of DOR staff. The Credit was
signed on September 29, 1972 and became effective on February 6, 1973. The
Consultants have commenced work and their report on a road maintenance program
is expected shortly.
Credit No.364 Rahad Irrigation Project; US$42 Million Credit of
March 30, 1973; Closing Date: June 20, 1978
The project is expected to irrigate an area of about 300,000 acres
which are now sparsely populated semi-desert on the East Bank of the Rahad
River. It would use water pumped from the Blue Nile and would include the
construction of irrigation supply, distribution and drainage works, the
provision of agricultural processing equipment, storage facilities, and
the settlement of about 14,000 tenant families (about 70,000 people) with
all the necessary infrastructure and supporting services. The Kuwait Fund
and USAID are participating in the financing of this project by providing
a loan of US$11 million each. The Credit became effective on August 29, 1973.
Consultants have already commenced work.
