THIRD IRAILWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Few countries in the world still relv so heavily on their railway
as the Sudan. With only 330 km of paved roads in the whole country (the
largest in Africa) and with roads and river transport serving as feeders to
the rail system rather than offering alterr.atives to it, the railway is by
far the most important means of transport on the trunk routes.
ii.       The railway's track capacity is notantially adequate to meet traffic
demands expected for a long time to come, but its inefficient operations, com-
bined in oarticular with a shortage of motive power and an inaaequate comnuni-
cations system, have reduced its effeccive capacity to such an extent that it
represents a major constraint to expansion of the economy as a whole. It is
not surprising that this situation has encouraged proposals for constructing
highway and other transport facilities to duplicate and compete with the rail-
way in spite of the inherent advantages of rail transport over the long dis-
tances involved.
iii.      The project is designed essentially to improve the railway's opera-
tional standards, and to provide the capacity needed to meet expanding demand
on the trunk routes. The project in no way detracts from the need to develop
complementary transport modes as speedily as possible, a point which is empha-
sized by the approval of an IDA credit for highways in 1972 (331-SU) and
assistance to river transport and civil aviation included in the proposed
project.
iv.       This report appraises the 1971-75 investment plan of the Sudan
Railways Corporation (SRC), including investments for Port Sudan, the
country's only deep-water port. These investments, together with operational
assistance being financed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),
are designed to meet increasing traffic demands and allow the railway to play
its proper role in the country's economic development. The project covers
all remaining items in the five-year investment plan as revised during the
past vear in consultation with Bank Group missions. The economic return on
the investment is estimated at a minimum of 14%, based on calculations which
could well grossly understate the overall effects it can have in removing a
major constraint on the country's development. The major items include
procurement of (a) diesel locomotives to meet increasing traffic needs, (b)
freight wagons to replace old units and exzand capacity, and (c) additional
ecuipment and technical assistance for Port Sudan.  Project investments will
be complemented by improved operational efficiency, targets for which were
agreed with the Government and SRC during negotiations.
v.        In addition to railway and port investments, the project includes
equipment and technica'l assistance for the River Transport Corporation,

experts for a new central railway training school, shore and floating equip-
menc, technical and consulting services for Port Sudan, equipment and techni-
-sl. assistance for the River Transport Corporation as well as the other con-
sulling services and training included in the nroject.  All the items financed
by IDA will be procured in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines. Retroactive
tfnancing of about US$0.25 million is proposed for consultants' services
rendered since November 1, 1973.
viii.     SRC has earned overall financial surpluses during recent years, with
a return on net fixed assets in use of 3.7% in 1972 and 3.3% in 1973 (exclud-
ing the river transport and hotel services transferred to separate corpora-
tions in 1971 and 1972).  Its main financial problem has been with outstand-
ing debts, largely from Government departments and public corporations, which
have increased sharply since 1970.  A solution with safeguards for the future
was agreed with the Government during credit negotiations. For the future,
early and selective increases in tariffs to maintain financial viability were
also agreed. No further major tariff changes are likely to be required before
1979 and a return on net fixed assets in use of about 6% should be feasible
in 1975 and succeeding years, though in 1977 this is expected to fall to
4.6% owing to the initial effect of competition from a new oil pipeline.
:x.       The project provides a suitable basis for an !DA credit of US$24.0
m: 5 on to the Democratic Republic of the Sudan.



SUTDAN
APPRAISAL OF TFE ThHIRD RAILWYA PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The railway is by far the most important long-distance carrier for
both freight and passenger traffic in the Sudan, providing the main link
between Port Sudan and Khartoum, as well as with the major agriculturai. areas
south and east of the capital.  It tlhus plays a vital role in the country and
in its economic development (see the-report 1/ of a Bank Economic Mission to
Sudan in November/December 1971).
1.02      The proposed project will be the Bank Group's third lending opera-
tion for the Sudan Pailways.  The first loan (202-SU, 1958) of US$39 nillion
to finance the railway's 1959-1960 development program was successfully com-
pleted in 1964. The second loan (440-SU, 1965) of US$31 million was for the
railway's 1966-1968 development program. Its execution was much slower than
originally expected and the loan was not fully disbursed until mid-1972, some
three vears later than originally scheduled. Princinal reasons for the delay
were (i) closure of the Suez Canal in 1967, affecting deliveries, (ii) changes
in the loan items to suit changes in traffic Datterns, (iii) procurement
problems, and (iv) political circumstances in the country.  Conditions under
both loan agreements were adequately met.
1.03      The only other Bank Group lending for transport in Sudan has been
an IDA credit (331-SU, 1972) of US$7.0 million, primarily directed to the
improvement of highway maintenance but also including technical assistance
in planning and coordination of the transport sector as a whole (para. 2.12).
1.04      Despite past investment in track and equipment the railway is not
able to satisfy the rapidly increasing demands for its services and, since
virtually all sectors of the economy depend on the railway, this is seriously
hampering economic growth in the country as a whole.  Further substantial
investments are now undoubtedly needed but they must also be accompanied by
efforts to increase the railway's efficiency. The Government, fully aware of
this, has agreed that outside experts should be employed to recommend and help
implement measures to improve operations (para. 3.13). This together with the
supplementary technical assistance and equipment included in the project,
given reasonable cooperation from SPC staff, should enable the railway to ful-
fill the important role it must continue to play in the economy of Sudan.
1.05      The project consists of (a) the 1973-1975 investment program of the
Sudan Railways Corporation (SRC); (b) equipment and technical assistance for
Port Sudan; (c) equinment and technical assistance to the newly formed River
Transport Corporation; (d) airport preinvestment studies; and (e) training
for the staff of the Auditor General. The total cost is estimated at
1/   "The Economic Development and Prospects of the Sudan" (four volumes),
Report No. AE-27 dated June 9, 1972.

US$79.7 million with a foreign exchange component of UTSS44.1 million (55%).
About US$20.i million of the foreign currency requirements are expected to be
provided by various financial sources either already agreed or under negotia-
tion. The Association will finance the remaining US$24.0 million of foreign
exchange expenditures, which is about 54% of foreign costs or about 30% of
total project costs.
1.06      This report is based on information suDpltLed by the Government,
SRC and the 1971 Bank Economic Mission, and on the findings of appraisal
missions in December 1972 and August 1973 consisting of Messrs. C. Buratti
(engineer), J.M. Kesson (consultant engineer), M.S. Parthasarathi (economist)
and K.C. Rodley (financial analyst). The report was edited by Miss J. Murphy.
2. THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR
A.   Economic Setting
2.01      The Sudan, covering about 2.5 million km , is the largest country
in Africa. The terrain is largely uninhabited desert in the north and tropi-
cal forests and savannas in the south. It is traversed by the Nile Rivers
cl,se to which most of the population (about 16 million) live, though other
settlements are scattered throughout the south and west. The harsh climate
and long distances make the provision of cheap, efficient and reliable trans-
port particularly difficult. Agriculture dominates the economy, accounting
for over 40% of the gross domestic product and almost all export earnings.
Economic activity is largely concentrated within 400 km south and east of
Khartoum where the land is fertile and well-irrigated. Where water is avail-
able the potential for increased agricultural production is substantial, but
more and better transport facilities are needed if this is to be realized.
B.   The Transport Modes
2.02      The railway is the primary transport mode, with road and river
transport serving as feeders to it; their roles are becoming increasingly
important, however, with the extension of cultivated areas and the longer
distances that crops must travel to consuming areas or to Port Sudan.
Railways
2.03      The railway consists of 4,757 km of 1.06 m (3.5 ft) gauge, single
track line. The most heavily travelled section is the desert route between
Port Sudan and Khartoum via Atbara (787 kin) which represents only about 17%
of the network but accounts for about 60% of total freight traffic carried.
(Railway traffic densities are shown in Chart 7302R, attached.) There is an
alternative route between the port and the capital via Kassala, and branch
lines north to Karima and Wadi Halfa, west to El Obeid and Nyala, and south



- 3 -
to Wau; the last two were completed about 12 years ago with Bank Grouo assist-
ance. The system provides potentiallv effective links between most of Sudan's
widely scattered productive areas. Further details of the railway and its
operations are given in Chapter 3.
Highways
2.04      The highway network is still in a very early stage of development,
and road density is very low compared with almost any other country in the
world.  There are about 18,500 Io of roads and tracks, of which less than 2%
are paved (most near Khartoum), 13% are gravel-surfaced and 85% are earth and
sand tracks. Most gravel roads are in the three southern provinces where
laterite material is available; they have been inadequately maintained since
their construction some 30 to 50 years ago and are now in poor condition.
The tracks, cut periodically by vehicles moving cross-country, are mostly
usable only outside the rainy season (June-Seotember). The registered motor
vehicle fleet is only about 52,400 vehicles, but between 1961 and 1969 it
increased at an average annual rate of 8%. It is serving present demand
adequately, but the demand is severely constrained by the limitations of the
road network.
Inland Waterways
2.05      River services operate on two stretches of the Nile River system:
the 1,400 km long Kosti-Malakal-Juba section between central and southern
Sudan and the 290 km long Karima-Dongola section in northern Sudan.  Three-
quarters of river traffic is on the former with nearly all freight moving in
the southbound direction. Kosti is used as the freight transfer point between
rail and river because of navigational difficulties between Khartoum and Kosti.
Due to operational problems and to the directional imbalance of traffic flows,
the services oterate at high cost and in deficit. Experts from Romania have
recently reported on the technical aspects of the river navigation problems;
if these problems can be overcome, river transport should provide dependable
transport for some areas, particularly the remote southern region. The most
urgent need in terms of equipment is for additional barges to transport petro-
leum products to the southern region. The present capacity shortage is esti-
mated at 25,000 tons/year; barges to satisfy this shortfall will be provided
under the project. River services were operated by SRC until 1972 when they
were turned over to the semi-autonomous River Transport Corporation, newly esta-
blished under the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Technical
assistance will be provided under the Droject to help the new corporation to
improve its operations and to promote better coordination with the railway.
Ports
2.06      Port Sudan, on the Red Sea, is Sudan's only important deep-water
seaport. Fewer ships have been calling since the Suez Canal was closed in
1967, but average cargo loaded or unloaded per ship has substantially increased,

--;:f-     or more before facilities are available.  The existing

e_ :_.OL _-e ?°: -anc its oY?eration are given in Chapter 3.
'C0-    The Sudan Shinping Line, originally a joint operation of the Gov-
arn-enz;s of thk- Sudar. and Yugoslavia, has been wholly owned by the Sudan
e 1967.  Its five shins provide services to North Sea and Atlantic Ocean
ports in Europe, and to Yemen and Saudi Arabia. A service to the Far East
may shortlv be inaugurated when two new ships on order arrive. The company
s cperated on sound commercial principles and its profitability has been
el-hanaced since Zhe Suez Canal was closed as it does not have to compete with
;_he nur.erous other lines formerly using the Canal and serving Port Sudan en
rouce .
Aviation
2.03      The Sudan Ainrays Corporation, founded in 1947, is the national
carrier, its fleet of eight aircraft providing both domestic and international
services. Twenty airports and airstrips in Sudan are served by scheduled
flights, but only Khartoum can handle large aircraft and night landings.
Airnorts at Port Sudan, Juba, Geneina and Kassala also handle some regional
services; the others are used exclusively for domestic flights. Th principle,
the airline is onerated as a commercial enterprise though the Minister of
Transport and Communications can direct it to provide services regardless of
profitability, and in recent years the airline has operated at a substantial
loss. While international services presently account for more than two-thirds
of total revenue, it is the domestic and regional routes which of.er a more
promising basis for the corporation's future.  Air transport is expected to
be used increasingly instead of first and second-c' ass passenger service by
rail, particularly over long distances.  Preinvestment studies fcr airport
development are included in the project.
Pinelines
2.09      The Government has recentl'r decided to construct a nipeline with
utaita t   fiinancing;, to carry white otis from  t-e refinery at Port Sudan to
-Cnhatoum. Al.anougn a pipeline could be de_erred for a few years on strictly
econoni c criteria, in view of the railway's past nerformance and the serious
oil snortages uncountrv that have resulted, the Government nas concluded
th'at a more reliable node of movement of these basic commodities is needed.
Mhen t;-e pipeline is completed in 1976, the railway will lose much of its



- 5 -
bulk petroleum traffic on the Port Sudan-Khartoum line (about 600,000 tons in
1977, or 15% of total rail freight). While the effect on SRC's finances will
be substantial, the railway will still have to move substantial volumes of
oil (about 300,000 tons in 1977) from Khartoum to the rest of the country.
C. Planning and Coordiaation
2.10      The Development Plan for 1970/1-i974/5, as ori4nally conceived in
1970, was an uncoordinated listing of projects proposed by ;Ministries, not
based on economic nriorities. The Government has since decided to review
and revise the plan annually, out the review mechanism continues to be
handicapped by inefficient planning efforts at the sector level.  For the
transport sector this has meant a low level of investment in comparison with
needs, with the result that transport has become a major bottleneck to current
economic activity as well as to plans to increase production, especially in
agriculture. Effective transport planning is now critical in the Sudan's
overall efforts in economic development.
2.11      Transport coordination, on the other hand, is not likely to pose an
immediate problem since most transport services in the Sudan are complemen-
tary; the only duplication at present is between Khartoum and Wad iMedani
(185 km) where a bitumen road parallels the railway. With the expansion of
transport demand, however, the need for proper planning and coordination of
future investments in infrastructure is increasing. Specific areas which
may require attention are (a) a proposal to extend the road from Wad Medani
to Port Sudan over the next few years and (b) the proper roles of rail and
river services linking the southern regions to the rest of the country and
the need for more feeder connections.
2.12      To deal with coordination problems and to advise on planning in the
transport sector, highway Credit 331-SU includes financing for the services
of two transport specialists to be attached for two years to the Ministry of
Transport and Communications, which has resnonsibility for all modes except
aviation. In addition to advising on current issues, the experts will help
establish a unit in the Ministry to carry on this work. They are being
recruited and are expected to begin work early in 1974.
3.  TEE SUDAN RAILWAYS CORPORATION
A.   Organization, Management and Staff
3.01      Until its incorporation in 1967, SRC was a Government department
under the direction of the Minister of Transport and Communications, respon-
sible not onlv for the railway but also for Port Sudan, River Nile steaner
services, anc a number of hotels and rest hAouses.  In 1971 its hotels were
turned over to a newly created Hotels Corporation, and in mid-1972 the new



-6-
River Transport Corporation zook over the steamers. Yora recently, in May
1973, the Government placed Port Sudan under the Ministry of Defense and
appointed a committee for separating the railway and the port, with the inten-
tion of creating a separate corporation for handling port operations, probably
from July 1, 1974. A recently promulgated Sudan Railways Corporation Act
(No. 26 of July 12, 1973) omits all reference to SRC's resnonsibilities for Port
Sudan, but during negotiations the Government stat-ed twat SRC would continue
to ad-inister Port Sudan until there is an af-ective ports aurhority.  Also,
the Government agreed to give IDA the opportuniLty to comment upon the proposed
Port Act before enactment.
3.02      The new SRC Act provides for a Board of eleven members, consisting
of a full-time Chairman, the General Manager of SRC, and three Government, two
union and four user representatives.  The Chairman and the General Manager are
appointed by the President after consultation with the Minister of Transport
and Communications who selects the other members.  'Under the Act, the Board
has reasonable autonomy and can delegate functions to the Chairman.
3.03      While SRC's senior officials are technically comoetent, their work
is hampered by a management structure which lacks clear lines of authority
(Chart 8081); there has also been insufficient contact between SRC headquarters
at Atbara and the principal users mainly in and to the south of Khartoum.
The new Board is to review the management arrangemients by December 31, 1974,
and SRC agreed during negotiations that the Associacion will be given the
opportunity to comment upon any new proposals before implemention.
3.04      SRC's staff strength has been stable since 1969 at about 36,000, of
which about 4,000 are normally engaged on capital and renewal works and 2,000
on port operations, leaving about 30,000 for railway operations (Table 1).
Staff remuneration is based on civil service salary scales and includes a
cost-of-living allowance and low-rental housing. Two unions were created in
1971 from a former total of 17 unions; one is for professional and clerical
staff and the other for unskilled labor. Strikes are illegal but slow working
has resulted from dissatisfaction over Government policies and salaries.
Increments, stopped since 1969, have recently been granted (para. 6.09) and
morale is improving.
3.05      Training schools exist for new entrants and for lower grade staff.
Technical school graduates are given practical training in workshops, and
newlv graduated engineers receive three to four years training, about half
of it abroad. Despite these efforts, however, SRC's requirements are not
being adequately met.  Lower-level staff training is uncoordinated and
training for staff advancing to junior and senior supervisory posts is in-
adecuate. A renort 1/ on SRC's training by the International Labour Office
(ILO) has recommended establishing a central training school at Atbara. The
school's initial technical assistance and equipment requirements are
included in the project.

Republic of Sudan," G.P. Miagov, January .972.

B. Budget, Accounts, Audit and Insurance
3.06      The SRC Board is empowered to approve annual caDital and revenue bud-
gets. In addition, revised estimates are submitted for Board approval as soon as
possible after six months of the financial year have elapsed. Annual accounts
are sent to the Minister together with an auditor's report and a general re-
port on SRC's activities for the vear; these are furnished to the legislature.
The accounts follow an. acceptable commercial -format.  Por: Sudan's finzances
are, for the most nart, accounted separately zrom the railway; revenue and
most expenditure are identifiable and port assets and liabilities are separated
in supporting schedules on SRC's balance sheet. No charge is made against
port revenue, however, for port-related administrative and financial work
undertaken at SRC's headquarters. SRC's internal audit division is adequately
staffed.
3.07      Under the Auditor General Chambers Act, 1970, SRC's accounts are
audited by the Auditor General who is responsible to the Revolutionary
Comm.and Council. This Act, which extended the Auditor General's responsi-
bilities to all public bodies and corporations, greatly increased izs work-
load, and comnletion of some audits, including those of SRC, has been
considerably delayed. To alleviate the situation additional staff have been
recruited, and some senior officers are taking part in a training program
arranged with the Egyptian Government. Further training of personnel from
the Auditor General's staff is desirable, and provision is made under the
project to finance training in the USA and the UK, tentative plans for which
have already been made.
3.08      In common with most other railways, SRC is self-insured, and claims,
which have been negligible, are met out of revenue. However, in respect of
Port Sudan, the Government agreed during negotiations to engage competent
insurance experts to advise on insurable risks and, not later than January 1,
1975, take such action to provide for insurance as shall be agreed with the
Association following review of the experts recommendations.
C.   Property
Railway
3.09      The main track infrastructure has been improved during the last
few years, assisted in Dart by the Bank Group, and is now sound and able to
carry considerably more traffic than forecast up to 1974/75.  Speeds are
relatively low and the existing earth and sand ballasts are adequate for the
time being, but for the future, improvements should be nossible (such as
stone ballasting on sections not subject to wind blown sand, use o' welded
rail joints and better methods of local timber sleener impregnation).
Signalling is adequate for the traffic and speeds, but train control and
telecommunications equinment is mostly old and unreliable, and needs to be
improved for the principal routes and between the main centers. Buildings



- 8 -
and workshops are generally adequate, although maintenance could be improved.
A brief description of the railway track, buildings and equipment is given
in Annex 1.
3.10      The locomotive fleet is partly steam and partly diesel (Table 2).
Availability has been poor, particuLarly of the diesel locomotives, and this
has le6 to a serious shortage of motive power. The poor availability of
diesels stems nrincipally from (a) inahiliyv _o meet t.-e difficult operating
anc clImatic conditions, (b) insufficient sDares supply, and (c) defects in
design 'see Annex 2). However, locomotive availability has shown improvement
in the last few months, reflecting SRC's determination to imDrove its level
of efficiency. Polling stock (Table 3) is reasonably maintained.
Port Sudan
3.1,      The port lies on a natural sea inlet and has ten general cargo
berths, an oil jetty, a grain berth with silo, two old coal berths now used
for export cargo and crude oil imports, and shallow draft facilities. There
are 11 transit sheds and 15 other storage sheds in the port area, but most
are too small for efficient use of modern cargo-handling equipment. The
fixed assets are generally adequately maintained, but the wharf surfaces,
roads and stacking grounds need relevelling. The floating and shore mech-
ical equipment, which includes too many individual types, is not well main-
tained. The experts providing technical assistance to the Dort under the
project will assist in reorganizing the dockyard and the mechanical
equipment depot to correct this. Details of the facilities at Port Sudan
are given in Annex 3.
D. Operations
Railway
3.12      The railway has been favored by a virtual monopoly and by a pre-
dominance of long-haul bulk traffic, but on the other hand, is adversely
affected by factors such as the pronounced seasonal demand (December to June,
during the cotton and grain harvest season) and harsh desert conditions, giv-
ing rise to considerable technical and operating problems. Some operating
performances (Table 4), such as average load per freight train, average load
per freight wagon, and freight ton-km/year per available wagon, are good
compared with railways elsewhere; but others, such as locomotive utilization
and freight wagon turnaround time, are poor. There are numerous accidents and
failures of equipment in operation which result in considerable delays; late
running is an everyday occurrence, compounded by poor communications and
inadequate operating control.
3.13      The need to improve operations has been stressed in various reports
over the years, including a report in 1963 by the French consultants SOFRERAIL.
At the time of the Second Railway Project in 1965, it was felt that the rail-
way could, by itself, overcome these deficiencies, but SRC has been slow to



- 9 -
achieve any change. Improvement in train operations and in utilization of
equipment is fundamental if SRC is to carry increased traffic, and the Govern-
ment has now employed outside siecialists to improve SRC operatior,s.  These
specialists are being provided by the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), with the Bank as executing agency, under a contract with the Common-
wpealth Railways (Austra_ia), which operates under similar desert conditions.
The snecialists began work in the Sudan in Au:,ust 1973 for an 18-oroth. period.
Tne results to be obtained will de?end considerably uDon the cooperat_on and
effort of SRC management and staff.  During negotiations the Government and
SRC agreed to take all necessary step,s to _mprove the railways's operating
efficiency after review of the specialists' recommendations w ith IDA.  A
number of operational targets (given in Annex 4) have been agreed and a
system of monitoring will be established to permit regular evaluation of progress.
Port Sudan
3.14      Port productivity (Annex 3) is good, averaging 155,000 tons of
dry cargo per effective berth and 88 tons per meter of wharf in 1972. The
port is, however, operating near capacity, in terms of both berthing space
and cargo handling. There is considerable congestion on shore due to slow
clearance by the railway. The average volume awaiting movement is about
100,000 tons pkas 400-500 loaded freight wagons.
3.15      Loaded freight wagons (including oil wagons) out of Port Sudan
average about 16n daily (equivalent to 6.6 normal freight train loads), though
to keep the nort reasonably clear the railway needs to move about 200 wagons
per day (or eight freight trains daily). Marshalling facilities are currently
inadeuuate, but when reception and dispatch yards are completed in 1975 they
should meet the port's operating needs for some years.
E.   Traffic
Railway
3.16      Revenue-earning freignt increased from 2.9 million tons in 1969
to about 3.1 million tons in 1971, but dropped back to 2.9 million tons in
1972 (and is expected to amount to only 2.8 million tons in 1973) due primarily
to the railway's inability to meet the total demand because of adverse weather
conditions, locomotive and wagon breakdown and labor unrest. About 80% of
the traffic is to or from Port Sudan, mostly export/import traffic. The
principal export commodity is cotton, while Detroleum products constitute the
major item transDorted from Port Sudan, where the refinery is located, to the
rest of the country. Details of railway freight traffic are given in Table 5.
3.17      Future traffic forecasts are based on projections prepared by &.e
Bank Economic Mission and by SRC's Research Denartment, updated during
appraisal. These indicate that. assuming the railway has sufficient capacity,
revenue-earning freight will increase to about 3.8 million tons in 1976 and



- 10 -
to about 4.2 million tons in 1980, reflecting a growth of about 4.5% p.a. in
total traffic. Details of the forecast are given in Table 5 and are summarized
below:

3.18      The average length of freight haul has been about 900 km per ton
of freight for the past few years and is expected to continue at this high
level in the immediate future, but to decline to about 850 km from 1977 on-
wards when the oil pipeline goes into operation and SRC loses a substantial
volume of long-distance oil traffic.
3.19      The railway's passenger traffic (Table 6), after recording a sub-
stantial increase in 1970, has decreased since then, due apparently to a de-
terioration in service. The number of passengers in 1972 was 3.2 million,
about the same as in 1969. For the future, a modest growth of 2% per annum
is projected (more or less in line with expected population growth) in the
expectation that service will show some improvement.



- ii -
Port Sudan
3.20      Traffic through Port Sudan (Table 7) follows th.e nattern of rai L
traffic to and from the port. The only exception is petroleum traffic: im-
ports include crude oil which is refined in Port Sudan before shipment by rail,
while exports include surpluses of certain petroleum products.  Total port
traffic in 1972 amounted to 3.1 million tons, of which 1.4 million tons was
bulk petroleum and refined products anc the baLance of 1.7 million cons dry
cargo. Traffic through the port is expected zo grow az about 5% p.a., anr to
exceed 4.5 million tons, including 1.9 million tons of bulk petroLeum pro-
ducts, by 1980.
F.   Tariffs and Costs
3.21      Details of ra-lway freight and passenger rates and fares, and of
Port Sudan tariffs, are given in AXnnex 5. SRC is empowered by law to fix its
own tariffs after obtaining ministerial approval. Current rail and port ta-
riff levels were, for the most part, established in 1969, when rates for a
number of goods and services were raised. A 1970 study by SOFRERAIL of railway
costs and tariffs indicated, however, that some commodities were still not
covering variable costs and further increases were made in 1972.
3.22      Passenger fares were increased bv 20% to 28% in 1969 and are now
estimated to cover the variable costs of these services except on verv short
distances.  After including a reasonable contribution to overhead costs,
however, only about 70% of total costs are covered, but the Government is
unlikely to sanction any further increases at this time.
3.23      SOFRERAIL made a number of recommendations to improve the tariff
structure, which is not related to the costs incurred for the transport of
individual goods. After critical examination of the report by SRC, the con-
sultants revised and expanded thleir original findings in 1972.  On the basis
of the second report, and of additional costing and statistical data, SRC has
completed a general review (termed Project 84) of the rail tariffs to base
them more effectively on cost and market considerations. The Government
agreed during negotiations that, not later than February 1, 1974, new tariffs
based on the cost of providing individual services and facilities will be
introduced by SRC, taking into account the rate of return covenant (para.
6.12) and the desirability of recovering at least the marginal cost.
3.24      On the basis of financial forecasts to 1978, Port Sudan's tariffs
yield adequate revenue. However, quay dues for imports are ad valorem and
also unrelated to service costs.  The tari-fs should be reviewed to ensure
that thev are cost-based and that the economic savings and benefits enjoyed
by foreign ships using ?ort Sudan are recovered so far as is reasonable and
practicable. The Government agreed during negotiazions to complece such a
review by July 1, 1976.

G.   The SRC Investment Program
3.25      As originally conceived, the Government's Five-Year Plan for 1971-
1975 allocated LSd 15.0 million to SRC, of which LSd 14.1 million was for the
railways, LSd 0.1 million for the port and LSd 0.8 million for river trans-
port (since separated from SRC). The Bank's 1971 Economic Mission suggested
that these allocations were far short of requirements if forecast traffic
demands were to be met.  The Bank Groun recomnended, however, that, prior
to further SRC investment, outside experts should be emploved to advise SRC
on railway operations, to which the Government has since agreed (para. 3.13).
In consultation with the 3ank Group, a revised Investment Plan (Table 8 and
Annex 6) has been prepared by SRC and approved by the Government. It calls for
a total investment in railways and ports of LSd 30.1 million over the five-year
period. The proposed IDA credit will help finance the remaining items in
SRC's development program, involving a total outlay of about ISd 26.7 million.
The investment needs have been estimated on the assumption that by 1975 the
railway's operating efficiency will improve as shown in Annex 4.
4. THE PROJECT
A. Description
4.01      The project items are as follows:
(a) SRC's investment program up to 1975, including
(i)  for the railway:  track renewal, structures and
communications, locomotives and rolling stock,
and a central training school; and
(ii)  for Port Sudan:  cargo-handling equipment,
facilities and structures, and technical
assistance;
(b) equipment and technical assistance for the River Transport
Corporation;
(c) preinvestment studies for future airport development; and
(d)  training for the staff of the Auditor General.
Railway Investments
(i) Track Renewal
4.02      Track renewal under the project will consist mainly of timber
sleeper replacement, drainage improvements and siding installations. A



- 13 -
beginning will also be made on SRC's program to replace 50 lb/yd (appoxi-
mately 25 kg/m) track in poor condition on branch lines with available
secondhand 75 lb/yd (37.5 kg/m) rail.
(ii) Structures and Communications
4.03      The project includes minor additions and improvements to railway
buildings and workshops and to workshop equipment and handling fac'.:zies.
Another very important element is the provision of better communications for
the Port Sudan - Khartoum routes to improve traffic operations and train and
freight car control.  The detailed measures to be taken and communications
equipment to be provided will be determined after review of operatioi.s by SRC
and the technical experts orovided by the UND? (para. 3.1-3), and with the
cooperation of the Posts and Telegraph Department.
(iii) Locomotives and Rolling Stock
4.04      On the basis of expected traffic, a detailed assessment has been
made of the railway's requirements for locomotives and rolling stock through
1980 (Annex 7).  In accordance with :his assessment, with nrojected expend-
itures under the 1971-1975 Investment Plan, and as a further step toward ul-
timate elimination of steam traction, the Droject provides for rehabilitat-
ing the diesel fleet and for buying 10 main line and 20 shunting diesel
locomotives. The Government had proposed that the entire locomotive fleet
be dieselized during the current plan period but, in the opinion of the As-
sociation, a more gradual changeover would be prudent, since problems of
maintaining and operating the diesel fleet have still to be resolved, and
the ultimate number of locomotives required is difficult to determine be-
cause it depends in part on the extent to which the railway can improve
the utilization of the existing fleet. Completion of dieselization has
therefore been deferred to the next plan period.
4.05      Under the project, 620 freight wagons will be provided to replace
small-capacity wagons more thin 40 years old and unsuited to carrying bulk
cargoes over long distances. An additional 380 wagons will also be provided
to satisfy increases in freight traffic, including about 100 oil tank wagons
required to carry increased tonnages of oil products until the proposed white
oil pipeline from Port Sudan is completed in 1976. From 1977, there is expec-
ted to be an overall surplus of some 270 tank wagons, but these will be
mostly absorbed within 3 to 4 years by (i) increasing white oil traffic on
routes other than Port Sudan - Khartoum, (ii) increasinijkHT5   raffic
(which SRC will continua to carry), (iii) increasing vegetable oil and mo asses
traffic, and (iv) replacing old, small capacity units which will be scranpec.
Any surplus can be converted to general use as open wagons by removing the
tanks. Additional passenger coaches, mostly for lower class travel, will
also be provided under the project to meet forecast passenger traffic needs,



- 14 -
and the normal replacement program of passenger coaches and service vehicle
bodies will be continued; most are of timber, fabricated locally in SRC work-
shops, and are replaced every 20 years. SRC is carrying out a program to
reduce failure of trains in service bv providing all rolling stock less than
20 years old with roller bearings and improved couplers; the program will
be completed under the project.
(iv) Trainine
4.06      The new central railway training school at Atbara recommended by
the ILO (para. 3.05) will be established under the project, and equipment
and initial foreign expert assistance provided. SRC will provide buildings.
Port Investments
(i)  Equipment, Facilities and Structures
4.07      Port Sudan is operated efficiently, but is working close to its
present capacity. This can be exDanded on a limited scale as a short term
solution, and to speed up cargo handling the project includes the purchase
of new and replacement shore and floating equipment. Additional storage
sheds will also be provided and the dockyard surfaces, which have deterio-
rated as a result of inadequate maintenance, will be relevelled.
(ii) Technical Assistance
4.08      Consultants will provide technical assistance to improve port man-
"Agement and to reorganize maintenance. They will also examine the medium
wad long-term port requirements of Port Sudan.
X9 er Prolect Items
,4.9       The project includes the provision of equipment and technical as-
sistance to the recently created River Transport Corporation (para. 2.05) to
ensure coordination with railwav services and to increase the efficiency of
fleet operations, particularly in the South. It also includes the services
of consultants to undertake engineering and economic analyses for the further
development of airports at Port Sudan, Wau, Juba and Malakal; these preinvest-
ment studies are expected to form the basis for a future airport construction
project suitable for Bank GrouD financing. Additionally, as outlined in para.
3.07, assistance in training senior staff of the Auditor General employed on
SRC and other public enterprise auditing is desirable and will be provided
under the project.

B. Cost Estimates
4.10       Total project costs are estimated at LSd 27.8 million (US$79.7
million) of which LSd 15.4 million (US$44.1 million) is in foreign exchange;
LSd 6.9 million (US$19.9 million) represent local taxes and duties; and
LSd 5.5 million (US$15.7 million) comprise other local costs. The estimated

4.11      The cost estimates for the raiway and port items (showm in detail in
Table 8) are based on recently received quotations and bids for similar equip-
rent, updated for 1973 prices, together with estimated local taxes.  Contin-
gencies have been provided for all items for which firm contracts have not yet
been received: a physical contingency allowance of about 5% and a price contin-
gency of about 10% a year are included.
C.   Financing and Procurement
4.12      The IDA credit of USS24.0 million will meet about 30% of the total
project costs and about 54%1. of the foreign exchange cost.  The balance of the
foreign exchange cost will be met from various sources, with local costs and
taxes being met by SRC, Port Sudan and the Government. Of the total credit,
iJS$17.24 million enuivalent will he relent iv the Government to SRC on normal
Bank terms, the balance being retained by the Government to cover the foreign.
costs of equipment and technical assistance for Port Sudan, river services,
training of the Auditor General's staff, and airnort studies (paras. 6.14
and 6.17). Details concerning the financing of SRC railway and nort invest-
ments are given in Table 8; thie financing of oroject costs is summarized as

4.13      The U.K. credit is to rehabilitate and improve 55 English Electric
locomotives supplied from Britain between 1961 and 1963. The credits
from the Federal Republic of Germany are for (i) 10 main line diesel locomo-
tives for which the bodies, frames and bogies are being built in Germany,
with the diesel engines and electrical transmission being supplied by Gen-
eral Electric (successors to English Electric) in Britain, so as to continue
standardization on this relatively successful equipment in the Sudan and vii)
20 diesel hydraulic shunting locomotives to be obtained from Germany. The
second long-term credit has been agreed in Drinciple.  The African Develop-
ment Bank's (ADB) first and second loans are to finance freight wagons and
underframes for coaches/service vehicles, to be procured on the basis of
international competitive bidding; the contract under the, first ADB loan has
been placed in Spain and a Spanish supplier's credit has been obtained to
finance the balance of foreign cost.
4.14      Imported material financed bv the proposed IDA creeit will be ob-
tained through international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA
guidelines; items covered will be worksnop machinery and handling equipment,
communications and train control equipment, roller bearings and draw-gear
for rolling stock, about 600 freight wagons and components, equipment for
the new railway training school, equipment and material for Port Sudan, and
oil barges. Retroactive financing is proposed for payments due on consultant's
services rendered after November 1, 1973, and prior to credit signature; the
amount involved is about US$0.25 million.
4.15      The SRC contribution covers the local costs of its investment pro-
gram. Like all Sudan state and private enterprises, SRC is required to pay
customs duties and a 'bank exchange' tax on all imported goods; the customs
duties on railway and port equipment vary between 30% and 45%, while the
bank exchange tax is 15%, making a total charge on imports of between 45%
and 60%; these will be financed entirely by SRC although customs duties will
be deferred. The Government will finance the local cost of equipment
and technical assistance to the River Transport Corporation, and of the
airport preinvestment studies.
D.   Disbursements
4.16      Disbursements from the IDA credit will be made on the basis of the
c.i.f. (Port Sudan) cost of imported equipment and materials and of the for-
eign cost of consulting and technical services. The schedule of estimated
disbursements is given in Table 9. Any savings on the items to be financed
by the credit should be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of similar
items, should these be found necessary in subsequent reviews of the Plan and
of the project, subject to review and approval by the Association.
E. Execution
4.17      The Ministry of Transport and Communications will have overall res-
ponsibility for execution of the project, coordinating with the appropriate



- 18 -
Ministry/Department concerning those project elements which are not its direct
concern. SRC is competent to carry out all parts of the project with which
it is concerned, with technical assistance on railway operations. Track and
other local works and assembly of imported freight car components will be
carried out by SRC. Consultants acceptable to the Association will be engaged
to give technical assistance to Port Sudan, to carry out the master plan study
on future port development, and to carry out the airport preinvestment studies.
Technical assistance acceptable to the Association will be obtained for start-
ing the new railway training school and to advise tne River Transport Corpora-
tion.
5.  ECONOMIC EVALUATION            -
Benefits of the Investment Program
5.01      Because of the size of Sudan in relation to its sparse population,
economic development is hindered by the considerable distances between poten-
tial areas of Production and consumption. With only 330 km of bituminous-
paved roads in the whole country, the rail network dominates the transport sys-
tem. The railway transports into the interior most fuel, food and essen-
tial consumer goods, as well as capital goods for development works, and also
moves most of the country's exports to its only seaport. The investments
proposed in the 1971-75 program are designed to reduce the existing constraints
and augment SRC's ability to meet the growing demands made on it.
5.02      For purposes of estimating the benefits attributable to SRC's
investment program, three different but mutually consistent approaches have
been adopted as follows:
(i)  If the railway is unable to meet the total traffic demand,
an additional agricultural production of about 300,000 tons
in 1976, and at least that much annually thereafter, will
be lost. This would involve a loss of a minimum of LSd 6.0
million in net value added to the national income of Sudan
in 1976 and in every year thereafter. The real benefit of
the project is that it will help the country avoid this
loss.
(ii)  Alternatively, if a reasonable road connection were to exist
between Port Sudan and the rest of the country, the traffic
which SRC could not carry would most likelv move bv road.
For the 600,000 tons of export-import traffic involved, this
would mean an annual cost, in 1976, of about LSd 9.0 million,
compared with LSd 3.0 million or so by rail. Transport by
rail would thus result in savings of at least LSd 6.0 million
per year, even before taking account of the heavy investments
needed to build the road in the first place.



- 19 -
(iii) A third approach is based on the princinle that if people
are willing to pay for a transport service, its value to them
must be at least as hign as the sum of money they are willing
to exDend. Thus, if the 600,000 tons of traffic which cannot
be carried without the prolosed investments can stand the rail
tariff of about LSd 5.0/ton on the average, it is reasonable
to conclude that this represents a measure of the minimum
real value added by the rail movement which would otherwise Ue
lost. The loss of benefits so involved would amount to LSd 3.0
million in 1976, growing thereafter with general traffic grpwth
The loss of benefits to passenger traffic is not included in
this evaluation.
The benefits of the major components of the program are evaluated below and
described in some detail in Annex 8.
5.03      Track Renewal:  Almost all work on track and structures consists of
normal maintenance and minor upgrading. In combination with the other parts
of the program, better communications will improve train operations, reduce
turnaround time for rolling stock and thus raise overall efficiency.
5.04      Diesel Locomotives:  The planned purchase of 10 heavy main line
diesel locomotives and 20 shunting locomotives is part of the continuing
program of gradual dieselization of the locomotive fleet. The rehabilitation
of some diesel locomotives purchased earlier will involve overhauling and
improving certain features for more reliable operation in the conditions
prevailing in the Sudan. The savings from this part of the 1971-75 program
will be about LSd 820,000 per year in operating and maintenance costs.
5.05      Rolling Stock:  Of the 1,000 wagons to be purchased under the program,
620 are to replace old, obsolete wagons and 380 are additions to capacity to
meet expanding traffic demands. Replacement of the obsolete wagons will not
only contribute to operational efficiency by reducing breakdowns, but also
avoid substantial and increasing maintenance costs. SRC will continue with
the program of providing roller bearings and stronger couplers for the remain-
ing wagons in order to reduce breakdowns. The additional passenger coaches
are also partly for replacement and partly for additions to meet the forecast
modest growth in traffic.
5.06      Port Sudan:  The allocations for Port Sudan are orimarily for
deferred maintenance and for purchase of ecuipment both for replacement ard
for additions needed for efficient operation. These would improve the port's
dry cargo handling rate by approximately 10%, raising capacity by approximately
200,000 tons a year, and enabling it to handle the additional dry cargo fore-
cast during the next three or four years, thus avoiding costly shipping and
cargo congestion, or alternatively, eliminating the need to invest LSd 4 to
5 million to provide equivalent additional berth capacity.



- 20 -
Economic Return
5.07      The completion of the proposed investment program will enable SRC to
carry tne additional traffic which would otherwise not move at all, thereby
avoiding a net loss in the Sudan's national income. Other benefits would
include reductions in operating and maintenance costs (mainly in locomotives).
In the case of Port Sudan, urgently needed additional capacity will be provided
at minimum cost to handle the growing foreign trade and railway traffic
volumes. The proposed diesel locomotive program will produce a minimum
economic return of 22%, with a first year return of 15%. The whole of the
SRC program will have an economic return of at least 16-22% depending on how
the benefits are measured (para. 5.02) and a first year return of 12-1i%.
5.08      For purposes of estimating the above returns, the economic cost of
the project has been assumed to exclude the import and exchange taxes on the
foreign exchange component of the cost of the SRC program. If these taxes
are included on the cost side, which would probably reflect more accurately
the economic value of foreign exchange to the Sudan, the economic return
declines to a minimum of 14-18% for the whole program and to 17% for the
locomotive part.
6. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   Background
6.01      SRC had operating surpluses from railway and port services over
the 1968-1972 period, but incurred annual deficits from river and hotel serv-
ices which resulted in small net losses in 1968 and 1969 for the corporation
as a whole. The financial situation improved in 1970 with increases in traf-
fic and revenues, which more than offset cost increases, and overall surpluses
were achieved in subsequent years. Responsibility for the hotel services was
transferred to a separate corporation on December 1, 1971, and a similar
transfer was made of river steamer services on July 1', 1972.
6.02      Until recently, SRC was required to pay 4% interest on the Govern-
ment's capital investment (currently LSd 20 million, or 33% of total equity),
the balance of net revenues being available to finance investments, replacements
and debt servicing. Under Loan 440-SU the interest rate on equity was to be
raised to 6-1/2Z, but in view of the subsequent cash constraint the Bank agreed
in 1970 that the rate would remain unchanged until the financial situation im-
proved. On July 1, 1973, the Government raised the rate for all public
corporations to 5%, but during negotiations agreed to defer the application
of this rule to SRC until project completion -n fiscal 1977. SRC receives
assistance for investments from long-term foreign loans and suppliers' credits,
and short-term local finance from the Bank of Sudan.

in 1q68, improved to 3.5 and 2.6 respectively in 1970 but declined to 2.3 and
1.6 in 1973. The rate of return on average net fixed assets in use increased
from 0.8% in 1968 to 4.2% in 1971, declining to 2.6% in 1973. The main
causes for the deterioration in 1972 and 1973 were (a) a decline in freight
traffic due to SRC's poor operational performance; (b) increases in prices and
staff costs 2/ inadequately compensated by tariff adjustments; (c) an ill-
conceived staff bonus award made in 1972 to spur verformance which was not
matched by a corresponding increase in revenue; and (d) acute labor problems
with railway staff at Port Sudan in April/May 1973.

monthly rated staff (whose average pay is LSd 640 p.a. compared with
LSd 270 p.a. for each daily rated personnel) increased from about 4,600
to 6,000 (by 30%) since 1968.

6.06      The inventory of LSd 13.3 million at 1973 fiscal year end is high,
due partly to increased delivery time since the Suez Canal closure and the
inclusion of about LSd 3 million worth of capital items, some of which would
be better classified as work in progress. Nevertheless, consumable stores
are too high and a progressive reduction is expected during the next four
years.
6.07      The short-term  debt, a loan from the Bank of Sudan, became neces-
sary due largely to Government departments and public corporations delaying
payment for SRC services. Consequently, receivables increased from LSd 7.24
million in 1970 to LSd 16.0 million in 1973. The Association has repeatedly
stressed the need for settling these accounts as the interest payments on
the loan, now averaging LSd 400,000 annually, are a considerable burden to



- 23 -
SRC. The Council of Ministers is considering a scheme to repay the debts
over a period of four years. During negotiations the Government agreed to
take measures to settle overdue accounts by June 30, 1977, and to ensure
prompt monthly settlement of accounts for services rendered by SRC after
February 1, 1974. The financial position disclosed by the balance sheets
is otherwise satisfactory.
C.   Future Prosnects
6.08      SRC is aware of the need to adjust tariffs, particularly in-the light
of increasing costs and, in late 1972, as an interim measure, sought Government
approval to raise freight rates for certain commodities which are not now
covering variable costs (para. 3.21). This proposal would have increased
freight revenue by 8% overall. However, the Government decided to defer tariff
amendments pending completion of a full adjustment of the tariff structure and
rates based upon costs. In the meantime wages and salary awards were granted
and inflation raised other expenses. Consequently, new proposals based upon
current costs were recently prepared by SRC.  Termed Project 84, these will,
when implemented, initially raise annual freight revenue by LSd 2.8 million
(equivalent to an overall increase of 16%). During negotiations, the Govern-
ment agreed that SRC would implement tariff increases based largely upon
Project 84 by not later than February 1, 1974.
6.09      The forecast income accounts are based on projected traffic
growth (Tables 5 and 6), on increases in staff wages in July 1973 with only
normal incremental awards in other years, on increases in price levels of
5% per annum, and on the Project 84 tariff increases mentioned above. The
principal assumptions underlying the financial forecasts are detailed in
Annex 9. The forecast income accounts are summarized as follows:

6.10      SRC's financial target, as per its legislation, is to generate funds
adequate to cover its operating expenditure and debt service obligations and
to finance a reasonable part of investment needs, including replacements.
The forecast cash flow for 1974-1978 (Table 12) envisages SRC meeting
LSd 12.74 million, or 42% of investment during 1974-1978.  Tnis includes
1Sd 4.68 million for import duties on capital goods purchased during the period
1974-1976, payment for which by arrangement with the ('overnment will not occur
before 1977.  SRC's cash position should remain satisfactory in the period if



- 25 -
investments proceed at the rate forecast. To ensure this, during negotiations,
SRC agreed to limit investments to those included in the project up to the
Closing Date of the proposed credit, except for small items not exceeding
LSd 200,000 per annum in total, unless the Association otherwise agrees.
6.11      The Government's decision to defer raising the present 4% interest
rate on Government capital invested will assist SRC to meet capital financing
commitments. This is considered reasonable in view of the fact that repay-
ment of debts owing to SRC is being spread over 3-4 years (para. 6.07) and
the absence of a Government subsidy to compensate SRC's annual loss on
passenger services.
6.12      In terms of a return on net fixed assets in use, a financial target
of at least 6% per annum in 1975 and subsequent years is considered appropriate,
and it was agreed during negotiations that all necessary steps will be
taken to achieve this for fiscal 1975 and thereafter. However, due to the
loss of oil traffic after an oil pipeline is completed, the return is expected
to decrease to 4.6% in 1977, but to recover to 6% in 1978. If there is any
change in the level of staff wage increases and general price increases (para.
6.09) or if there are other events affecting SRC, the tariff adjustments
indicated in nara. 6.08 above may be inadenuate to achieve the outlined finan-
cial targets. To ensure any necessary remedial action, SRC agreed during
negotiations to review its financial situation in March of each year, com-
mencing in 1975, and to furnish promptly the results of such reviews to the
Association. If a review indicates an adverse change in SRC's financial
situation, SRC will, in consultation with the Association, take appropriate
action.
6.13      SRC should maintain a reasonable relationship between net cash
revenue and debt service requirements, and during negotiations agreed,
unless otherwise accented by the Assocation, not to incur any debt if its
net cash revenue for the fiscal year or the 12 consecutive months immediately
before the date of the occurrence, whichever is greater, would be less than
1.5 times the maximum debt service requirements of any succeeding fiscal year.
6.14      During negotiations the Government agreed that USS17.24 million
of thle proposed credit will be relent to SRC with reDayment over 25 years
(including a 4-year grace period) at 7-1/4% interest per annum.
6.15      The forecast balance sheet data are in Table 11.  The current ratio
is lowest in 1974 at 2.6, thereafter improving to 2.9 by 1978. The liquid
ratio declines to 1.2 in 1977 but improves to 1.4 in 1978. The debt equity
ratio would reach a peak of 39/61 in 1q75 and imorove to 26/74 by 1978.
Times interest ratio and debt service coverage (Table 10) would not fall
below 2.5 and 1.6 respectively, which is satisfactory.



- 26 -
6.o6      Fo-recast _ncez.e accwun_s .or Por-: Sudan (Table 10) show very satis-
factory operating ratios of 63%-66% between 197'5 and 1978, and a high (20%)
rate of return on net fixed assets when the project is completed. Forecast
balance sheets and cash flow (Table 13) show current, liquid and debt equity
ratios to be most adequate. In the absence of definitive major port develop-
ment plans and cost estimates, only IDA-financed capital investments and
other minor items have been included in these forecasts. The financial pro-
jections show a cash balance of ISd 6 million by end 1978, most of which is
expected to be required for capital investment.
6.17      During negotiations the Government agreed to transfer to the new
port organization ownership of the port facilities and items financed under
this credit on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association.
6.18      As the fixed assets inventory will be re-examined and value changes
made upon transfer to the new port organization, it is inappropriate at this
juncture to specify a financial target in terms of a return on net fixed
assets. During negotiations the Government agreed that such a target will
be agreed with the Association by July 1, 1975, for fiscal 1976 and thereafter.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED hND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      The following are the principal matters on which agreement was
reached during credit negotiations:
(a)  with the Government and SRC:

port facilities and items financed under this credit
(para. 6.17), and
(vi) Port Sudan's financial targets (para. 6.18).



- 27 -
7.02      Retroactive financing of approximately US$250,000 is recommended
for expenditure on consulting services (para. 4.14).
7.03      The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$24.0 million to
the Democratic Republic of the Sudan.

THIRD RAMWAY PROJECT
Brieif Description of Rallwa:' Property
Tracks and Stz'actures
1.        The principal rail route between ?ort Sudan, Atra ard Khartoum
was relaid in recent years (partly under Loan 4U0 -SU) with 90 lb/yd (45 kg/m)
rail on timber sleepers.  The other principal routes, Haiya-Yassala-Sennar
and Kharto=m-Sennar-Xosti-EL Obeid, have 75 lb/yd (37.5 kgAM) raJl on timber
sleepers. The tracks are laid on the local sand or soil; there is no stone
ballast and no welding of rail joints. Crossing stations are of adequate
length (mostly giving 640 m clearance). The track infrastructure on these
lines is in good condition and is adequate for the speeds in force and for the
volumes of traffic for a decade or so ahead. Stone ballasting and raiL joint
welding in areas not subject to excessive wind blown sand will improve speeds
and mainienance conditions but are not priority needs at present and can follow
in succeeding investment periods.
2.        Branch lines - to Roseires, Irala and Wau - have lighter, re-ased
50 lb/yd (25 kg/m) rail partly on steel and partly on timber sleepers; their
condition, particularly on the line to Roseires, is not good but again improve-
ment work is not of high priority because of the low traffic volumes. Second-
hand 75 lb/yd (37.5 kg/r) rail is, however, available from the Port Sudan-
htartoum relaying, as is surplus labor. A start with relaying on the branch
to Roseires, where tuaffic is increasing, is consequently proposed in the current
investment period.
3.        Wayside crossing station buildings, signalling and other installations
are adequate. Cammunications and train control facilities are not adequate,
however, and need to be reviewed and reconstructed to provide better train and
wagon control and general information on traffic operations.
4.        Buildings and workshops at major centers are generally reasonable,
although maintenance could be better. Bridges and culverts are of sizbsTantial
construction.
Motive Power
5.        The railway has been pursuing a policy of grad-;al dieselization siLce
1961 and still bas a maixed stock of steaza and diesei locnmotives.  Details of
the present fleet are given in Taple 2. Sumiarized, the =a3mber of:
Main '-ne steam locomot_vas   = 96  /
Main line diesel locmo-oives  = 103
Shunting steam locomotive     = 31
Siunting diesel locomotives   = 59
According to SRC, only 43 were in full time use at July 1973.



Page 2
6.        There have been substantial di. :  icuI;s W-1  the various diesel
:ocomotives (see Annex 2) and availability has been poor. The situation has,
ho-weve,, imroved considerably in receant months.
7.        Additional main line (10) and siunting (20) diesel locomotives are
proposed in the project to continue the policy of dieselization. This will
leave steam traction to cover only secondary operations, and final conversion
(requiring some 20 small, main line locomotives) is proposed for the next
r,vastment period, after 1975. All these new locomotives should be carefully
d,asigad using the exa3rience gained -with the existing diesel fleet to meet
the onerous operating conditions in the Sudan.
Rolling Stock
8.       The railway has some 5,500 freight wagons for public traffic and
about 400 coaches for passenger and baggage use. Details are given in Table 3.
Freight wagons are mostly steel bodied and predominately bogie. The railway
has been pursuing a policy, with wagons less than 20 years old, of substitating
roller for friction bearings and of providing stronger couplings of the auto-
matic type. Completion of this work, which is important to the railwaytsaefforts
to reduce operating failireG, is covered in the project. Provision  is also
made for replacing wagons over 40 years old by larger capacity units more suited
to the predominately long distance haulage of bulk commodities in the Sudan.
Passenger coach bodies are of timber, locally fabricated but using imported
underframes and bogies. The bodies are replaced at intervals of about 20 years.
Both freight wagons and coaches are reasonably maintained although better results
could be obtained without mnch additional effort.
Workshops
9.       The main repair shops for motive power and rolling stock are concen-
trated at Atbara. They are well equipped but will need reorganizing for the
better maintenance of the eventual fully diesel locomotive fleet. Diesel running
sheds at the main centers also need some development to cater for full diesel
operations. The steam maintenance facilities in the main workshops should be
abandoned In the near future, and the running sheds, which are in poor condition
and obsolete, should be closed as soon as possible.

THIRD RAILW.AY PROJECT
Diesel Locomotive Problem.s
1.       SRC's main line diesel locomotive fleet consists of three classes:
No. Units      Horse ?ower
Class 1000 - English Electric          65              i,850
Class 1200 - Cockerill-Ougree          15              1,850
Class 1500 - Hitachi                   20              1,850
There are also two Hitachi Class 1400 and one Henschel Class 1600 locomotives
obtained on a trial basis in 1964/65.
Class 1000 - English Electric
2.       This forms the most efficient part of the SRC fleet.  Availability
ranged from 85% to 70% between mid-1970 and 1972, dropping to 64% in
December 1972. The decline was due solely to lack of spare parts, due
in turn to delivery delays from the suppliers in the U.K. No major
overhauls were completed between March and September 1972, but spares
arrived in early 1973 and the backlog on overhauls had been eliminated by
mid-1973. Availability from May to October 1973 has averaged 85%.
Class 1200 - Cockerill-Ougree
3.       The weak point of these locomotives is the cooling system of the
thermic engine, which leads to overheating. Consequently, engine components
wear out rapidly; in particular, 23 crankshafts have had to be changed,
which is particularly unacceptable for locomotives operating in severe
climatic conditions and far from the supplier. Complete new coolirg systems
have been fitted to five of the locomotives and so far these are operating
well. SRC has deciced to proceed with a program to modify the other 10
locomotives, to be completed during 1974.  Availability is improving as
the work proceeds (55% in 'May-October 1,973) arn  should reach about 80%
Irom late 1974 onwards.
Class 1500 - Hitachi
4.       The present (October 1973) availability a; 60  is low
considering that most were supplied in 1969/70. The principal failure



ANNEX 2
Page 2
has been with the governor of the thermic engine, with repercussions on
various engine components, particularly destructive if allied to failure
of the lubricating oil circuit. There are about 10 other failure items
recorded; the high frequency of failures requires additional spare parts
from Japan and delivery delays keep-the locomotives inactive for long
periods. Future availability wilL depend on the final correction of the
governor defects and the arrival of spares from Japan, both started but
time of final completion is not yet kno--n.
Other Units
5.      SRC also has the following diesel powered units:
No. Units
Shunting locomotives - Class 100 - Bagnall                     6
- Class 400 - English Electric           5
- CLass 450 - Henschel                  4
- Class 460 - Henschel                 21
- Class 600 - KSK                       23
Total:                   59
Railcars - Hitachi                                          = 3 sets
6.       In December 1972, 20 out of the 59 shunting locomotives were out
of service awaiting spares; of these one was English Electric (British),
eight Henschel (German; mostly supplied in 1964) and eleven KSK (Japanese;
supplied in 1968). Spares for the KSK locomotives are in course of delivery
and the position is improving.
7.       None of the railcars is in operation, the main failures having been
with gearbox breakages, due to insufficiently hard gear teeth, and abnormal
wear of roller bearings on the driving axles. Units have been awaiting
replacement parts, mostly since mid-1972 but in the case of two cars,from
early 1969. There is a need for expert identification of the causes of
the most frequent failures and this is being dealt with.
General
8.       Overall, diesel units on the railway have given poor operational
results with high costs for repairs and maintenance. Low availability is due
largely to the unreliability of the units, arising in some cases from defec-
tive manufacture and in others from inability to meet the local arduous
operating conditions. In future, on bidding for locomotives, SRC will require
suppliers to provide improved and adequate demonstration and guarantees as to
reliability.



ANN2X 2
Page 3
9.       The problem of air filtration in the Sudan is particularly difficult.
Operating in frequent sand storm conditions between Port Sudan and Khartoum,
the Class 1000 locomotives need to have clogged air filters changed in the
workshops every time they pass through Atbara. Under normal operations,
locomotives shouldbe able to travel through frcm Port Sudan to 3hartoum;
to make this possible, new locomotives 4ill be required to have a device
which wil' permit the drivers to change the filters without the locomotives
having tp go to the workshops.

THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT
Port Sudar. - Background Data
General
1.        Port Sudan, the country's only deep water tort, has a
satisfactory location free from silt and adequately pro-tected from
the relatively small waves generated in the Red Sea. The port is pre-
sently working at its optimum capacity level (see data oelow), while
the zraffic forecasts indicate increasing volumes to be handled in the
future.
2.        The existing port facilities are oriented for railway operation
on the landward side, the railway providing almost the only connection
with the interior of the country. The wharf areas and the layout of port
facilities are not well suited to the efficient operation of mobile cargo
handling equipment or for cargo movements by road vehicles.  The immediate
needs are to provide for working areas more suited to such operations and
to renew and increase the shore handling and floating equipment.
3.        Although the over-the-auay performance of the port is good, it
is almost always seriously congested by accumulations of cargo on the
shore, due primarily to the inability of the railway operations to
provide a sufficient supply and clearance of wagons throughout the year;
these operations are expected to improve with the assistance to the railway
by UNDP-financed technical experts.
Shipping Data
4.        Traffic through the port from 1967 to 1972  was as follows, the
change after 1967 being due to the closure of the Suez Canal:
1967    1568    1969    1970    1971    1972

be worked by pontoon.
6.        There are eleven transit sheds on the wharves and fifteen other
storage sheds in the port area. Most are small and only six are of reasonable

additionally about 90 privately-owned warehouses outside the port area, mostly
used for cotton exports, and with an appraiaate capacity of 800,000 tons.

most part adequately maintained. The wharf surfaces, roads and stacking
grounds are adequate but need to be relevelled for better use of mobile
equipment. The float4Lng and shore mechanized equipment consists of too many
different types and ls poorly maintained; the dockyard and mechanical equip-
menT, depot need to be reorganized.
Operations
9.        Port operating efficiency is good as shown by the following
statistics for 1972:
DRY CARGO
Total, imports and exports                1,784,000 t
Equivalent deep water berths available      11.5
Cargo ner eouivalent deep water berth       155,000 t
Length of berths for cargo handling           2,032 m
Cargo handled per meter of berth                 88 t
Hatch hours                                 126,160 hr
Cargo handled per hatch hour                   14.1 t
Appliance hours (crane and derrick)         116,000 hr
Cargo handled per appliance hour               15.4 t
OIL CARGO
Import - crude oil                        1,063,000 t
- white oil                            7,000 t
- Subtotal                        1,070,000 t
Export -                                    272,000 t
Total, import and export                  1,342,000 t
10.       The dry cargo output is good and is assisted by (i) many ship
movements to maximize use of berta space, (ii) double banking at the main
berths with cargo working to pontoons on the seaward side, and (iii) pontoon
working for ships at the anchorages. No data are kept on berth occuizancy
or on ships' waiting time but the latter is reported to be reasonable.
Future Development
11.       There is no open ground suitable for further development at the
existing port site:   rlile there are three areas wnich could be adapTed for
better use, conversion would add to the difficulties of cargo working and

cause a temporary lowering of the throughput. The development of a second
port, near Suakin and 40 km south of Port Sadan, has been considered by
Yugoslav consultants; the site, an elongated lagoon with deep water and an
excellent entrance channel, is good, but is isolated and will require complete
supporting services. Detailed proposals are yet to be prepared, and will take
several years to implement. An early study is therefore required to examine
the medium term possibilities of development at Port Sudan, including (a) re-
development within the existing port area and (b) provision of offshore faci-
lities for oil tankers.  The consultants to be provided under the project will
carry out this study and develop outline plans for the solution selected.

Railway and Port Tariffs
A.   Railway
1.        Current -rail tariff levels are, for the most part, those established
in January 1969 when prices of the least expensive classes for goods were
raised:  5% for class 6; 10% 'or classes 7 to 15; c asses 2.6 anac 17, which
were lower than cost, were abolished.  At the same time passenger fares were
raised by 20% for first, second and third classes and 28% for fourtin class.
On July 1, 1972, goods class 15 was abolished due.to increased costs.
Freight Rates
2.        All goods shipments weighing a minimum of 10 kg up to full carloads
are now assigned to one of 14 classes and the rates per kilometer fall sharply
as distances increase. Some commodities, however, comprising about 30% (900,000
tons annually) of total traffic (notably cotton and petroleum products), are
transported under special contracts at agreed rates. Examples of non-contract
rates are gec;cn below:

period of 24 hours or part, rising to  LSd 10.0  after three demurrage days.
4.        Rates for parcels weighing up to 100 kg are also subject to a
tapered scale, examples of which are as follows:

Passenger Fares
6.        There are four classes of passenger fares and a surcharge for
sleeper accommodation, based upon the following charge (in LSd) per head
per kilmanter of rateable distance (minimum fares between any two stations
are also shown):
Classes
Sleeper     First     Second     Third      Fourth

On this basis the rail fares from Khartoum to Port Sudan, for example, a
distance of 785 Im (487 mi), are:
ISd                        4.710      9.420     4.710      2.355     1.810

7.        There are various exceptional fares for children, students and
organized groups. Furthermore, traders who !n any 12 month period have
paid the railway at least LSd 1,000 in freight charges are eligible for
first and second class fares at, 75% of the normal rate. The number of
such concessionary tickets is pro-rated with their annual value of freight.
For example, LSd l,CC qualifies for 3 concessionary tickets; ISd 10,000
for 12; and ISd 2C,0C0 for 17, etc.

8.        Recent tariff levels were established in January 1969 when
increases over then existing levels (originally established in 1965) were
made. These increases ranged from 25% for most services to 50% for porter-
age. Existing port tariffs are the following:

THIRD RAThWAY PROJECT
Notes on SRC Thresbtment Plau
(197 1-1975)
Infrastructure - Track
1.        On the main traffic route, Port Sudan - Atbara - Khartoum, the
track material, and spacing and length of crossing loops, are adequate to
carry in each direction about 3.6 million net tons of traffic. In 1972,
the maximcum Port Sudan - Khartoum traffic wa.s 1.i6 million net tons, while
the raximm forecast in either direction is about 1.8 million net tons to 1980.
There is consequently no need for major infrastructure works on the route.
The other maZ: lines of the system, Haiya - Kassala - Sennar and Ehartoum -
Sennar - Kosti - E. Obeid, are also adequate. Stone ballasting, on sections
not affected by blown sand, with a start on the Red Sea Hills section Porv
Sudan - :aiya, is proposed by SRC; this w11 not solve the immediate opera-
tional problems although it will assist eventually in reducing dust, and thus
equipment maintenance costs, and will also allow higher operating speeds.
A start with this work should await the next Plan period and no allowance is
made in the current Plan.
2.        The bramch lines, Sennar - Roseires and Rahad - Babanusa to Myala
and Wau have 50 -o/yd tracks, some in poor conditions, particularly the former.
SRC proposes to relay to Rose-res and to Babanzsa with second-hand 75 lb/yd
rail mostly avai_able fron the completed Port 3udan - Khartoum relaying, with
the balance to come from future relaying with 90 lb/yd rail on the Kharto=m -
Sennar section.  ,ain tih-s work is not essential to-4ards meeting the present
problems and can mainly wait until the next Plan pe7-_od; however to utilize
labor and ra; as* flable, a start could be made :n 197,-7$, (probably on the
Sennar - Roseires branch), and an allowance is accordinagly :ncluded in 'he
current Tnvestmnent F-an.
3.        The other frnds allowed under Track are mostly for normal timber
sleeper renewals carr?ed out aE a continuou3 nrogram, using local t4mber'
processed Lr the SRC workshops.
Structures and Ser7-ces
4.        No rajor items are proposed, except for comzunications where the
existing facilities -for management, operations and train control are inadequate.
A review of communications is being made by SRC in zonsanction with the state
Posts ard Telegraphs Department, while an expert to review the infornation and
traln control equinment is inoluded in the tech-ical assi-stance on operati-ons:
the work to be done and equipvnment to be provirFed '   SRC WF ' be decided when
the results of these reviews are avaiLable.

Locomotives
5.        The aim of SPC is to complete the conversion from steam to diesel traction
as early as possible. The needs are assessed (Annex 7) at 10 additional main line
diesel locomotives of 2,500 EP for use on heavy rail, 20 of 1,500 HP for use prin-
cipally on light tracks but also for ancillary services, and 20 shunting diesel
locorotives.  The financial case for corplete conversion is reasonable, but
eventual traffic requirements are not yet" certain. .ore importantly, in
the judgment of the Association, the problems with the mamitenance and-overation
of the existing diesel fleet need to be overcome as a first priority and the
completion of diesellsation should follow thereafter. Therefore, provision
for 10 heavy main line diesel locomotives and for 20 shunting locomotives is
proposed in the current plan, with the balance to follow in the succeeding Plan
(post-1975).
Rolling Stock
6.        SRC has been carrying out a program of providing all freight wagons,
less than 20 years old, with roller bearings and improved couplers. Provision
is made in the Plan for completion of this work, necessary to reduce "hot box"
failures which have become common with plain bearings, and coupler failures
which result from the heavier trains being employed.
7.        Freight wagon requirements are assessed (Annex 7) at about 380 addi-
tional units to meet the forecast increased traffic and 620 units to replace
existing wagons over 40 years old and of small capacity not suited to modern use
for bulk haulage on long heavy trains.  Arrangements already made by SRC, through
two ADB loans and a Spanish credit, cover about 400 units, leaving some 600
still to be obtained, financed by the IDA credit.
8.        Passenger coaches and service vehicles are mainly to meet require-
ments, with some additions to cover forecast passenger traffic increases in
the lower classes of travel. The timber bodies are manufactured by SRC,
while the underframes and bogies are imported.
9.        A report on training requirements for SRC by an ILO expertv
has recommended establishment of a central training school at Atbara.  Provisimr
for this is made in the ELan, the building to be designed and constructed by
&RC with equipment and initial foreign expert assistance being provided from
Bank Group sources.
Port Sudan
10.       The principal requirement for Port Sadan is a feasibility study to
examine the alternative possibilities of expansion at the existing port
(where room is limited) or to seaward (for bulk oil discharge). Provision
,is made in the Plan for the cost of consultants to carry out this study and
then to develop outline plans for the selected solution.

Democratic Republic  of Sadan," G.P. Miagov, January 1972.



3age3
11.       At the same time there is a need to develop an improved port ma.nage-
ment structure for the separation of the port and railways into two corporations.
The cost of technical assistance for this work is also included in the invest-
ment Plan.
12.       To 3eet :LTmediate requirements in the port, provis:on is ,nc'ud;d
tor shore and floating equipment, most of the items being repbace-rts bv
some are additional, such as twentiy forkklift trucks, two 20-ton quay czranes,
plant for mechanical workshops, two 200-ton barges for cattle and cargo
loading and a pilot launch, all required to improve the handling of ships and
output of cargo.

Fifty-six additional tank wagors, financed by the first ALB loan, are
c-i order. Another 56 are proposed in the second ADB loan, making a total of
11.  T- F.minplies a shortfall of 24 wfagons in 1976 which should be taken care
of    impr rnp oved turnaround time.
in view of the shorter average haul once white oil between Port
Sv,cdan and Khartoum has been diverted to the new pipeline, average turnaround
time will decrease. Assuning a turnaround time of 9 days, the total number
of tank wagons needed                         =   40 000 x 9
31- x 365-
= 430
and number available = 595 + 105
(112 less 6% for maintenance)              =  700
thus, surplus                                 =  270
Of these, about 110 tank wagons are over 30 years old, with average capacity of
20 tons; scrap these or convert to service water tanks, then total becomes
590 and surplus reduces to                    =  160
For 1980, number of tank wagons required      =  700,000 x 9
35 x 365
=  493
that is, the surplus amounts to about 95 wagons by 1980. New major developments
proposed south of Kosti may produce additional demand for molasses tank wagons
about 1977-78, while any surplus wagons can be converted to general use by re-
moving the tanks.

THflRD RAILWAY PROJECT
Basis of the Economic Evaluation
Benefits of Dieselization
1.        The benefits of diesel traction compared with steam include
savings in fuel, maintenance and other operating costs, as fo'lows:
(a)   Fuel Cost                                   1971      1976
Total traffic in tons (million)          3.0      4.0
Main line locomotive-km (million)        6.65      8.90
Shunting locomotive-km (million)         1.60     2.00
(i) If no additional diesel locomotives were purchased, the
1976 situation would be as follows:
Distance Covered         Fuel Reauired
(km '000)               (tons)
Steam     Diesel      Fuel Oil  Diesel Oil
Main line locomotives       1,300      7,800       47,700      37,900
Shunting locomotives          900      1,100       23,600       3,600
2,200     8,900        71,300     41,5O0
With fuel oil cost of LSd 6.99/ton and diesel oil, LSd 12.815/
ton at Port Sudan (according to the fuel oil company), total
fuel cost would be: LSd 498,000 + 532,000 = LSd 1,030,000
(ii)  With the purchase of additional 10 main line and 20 shunting
diesel locomotives as proposed in the project, the 1976
situation would be:

Distance Covered         Fael Requared
(km '000)               (tons)
Steam     Diesel      Fuel Oil  Diesel Oil
Main line locomotives       600       8,500       22,000     41,200
Shunting locomotives          0       2,000            0      6,500
600     10,500       22,000      47,700
Fuel cost would be:  LSd 15i,00o + 611,000   ISd 765,ooo
(iii)  F?uel cost saving = LSd 265,000 per year
(Savings will actually be larger than this, since diesel locomotives
can haul longer trains arn will not have to work the same number
of kilometers as steam locomotives for the same volume of traffic.
In addition, diesels work fewer locomotive-km for a given number
of train-km, owing to less frequent trips for servicing.)
(b)   Haulage of Fuel
Reduction in tonnage to be hauled annually    =  43,100 tons
Average haul                                    =  750 km
At LSd 0.005/ton-km                             =  43,100 x 750 x 0.005
Total saving   =  LSd 162,000 per year
(c)   Material for Repair and Maintenance
Average annual cost of maintenance and
repair of main line or shunting locomo-
tives, diesel or steam                         =  LSd 5,000
Number of new diesel locomotives                =  30
Number of steam locomotives no longer needed  =  55
Reduction in cost (25 x 5,000)                  =  LSd 125,000 per year
(d)   Labor Costs
Reduction possible in locomotive workshop
labor force with dieselization of locomo-
tive fleet                                     =  60% minimum
Present total annual wage                       =  Lsa 354,000
Approximate saving                              =  LSd 200,000
Reduction possible in onerating staff           =  80 persons
Annual savings from reduction in
operating staff                                =  LSd 55,000
Total labor cost saving                         =  LSd 255,000 per year
These savings will come about partly through attrition and partly by
an actual reduction to the extent alternative employment becomes
available, such as in alternative modes.



ANNE5X 8
Page 3
(e)   Water Supplies
Savings due to closing of watering stations = LSd 15,000 per year
Thus, the total savings due to diesel-
ization are estimated at                       =  LSd 822,000 Der year
2.        All the above savings will increase with traffic growth but this
has not been taken into account. The savings yield an economic return of
over 22% on the economic cost of about LSd 4.0 million.
Benefits of Railway Program as a Whole
3.        The program as a -whole is primarily designed to improve overating
efficiency and capacity on the critical Port Sudan - Atbara - XCnartoum corridor
which is now operating at a low efficiency level due to shortagge of motlve Sower
and wagon capacity, to frequent train failures and to obstruction of track by sand
drift; consequently, operations are close to effective capacity. The proposed
track works, purchase and improvement of rolling stock and locomotives, and opera-
tional technical assistance will help to improve SRC's capacity and enable it to
carry the additional traffic volumes forecast to 1978-80. This traffic, which
otherwise would not move, is expected to amount to a minimum of 600,000 tons in
1976, rising gradually thereafter, half of which will be exports and half imports.
It is estimated that the annual net loss in national income if the export traffic
were not moved would be at least LSd 6.0 million; the traffic so lost would includi
cotton, oilseeds, oilcake, foodgrains and chrome ore. The failure to move imports
would also have serious effects on the economy in general but these have not been
evaluated due to lack of information. The quantifiable benefits yield a return
of about 21% on the investment of about LSd 24.7 million.
4.        Although no real road transport alternative exists in the Port
Sudan - Khartoum corridor, an alternative evaluation was made of the addi-
tional transport cost likely to be involved if such a road were to exist
and were used to carry the 600,000 tons of traffic annually. Road transport
cost is estimated to be at least LSd 0.015 per ton-km compared with a rail
cost of about LSd 0.005 per ton-km. With an average length of haul of 1,000
km for the traffic involved, the additional road cost would be about LSd 6.0
million per year. Again, this does not take into account the capital cost
involved in building a road. On this calculation also, the economic return
on the invuestment would be about 21%.

Principal Assumptions used in SRC Financial Forecasts
The financial projections are based on the following princippaJ
assumptions:
1.   Railway freight traffic increases as forecast in Table 5 aid
Port Sudan traffic increases as forecast in Table 7.
2.  Total railway passenger traffic increases at 2% per annum.
3.   Staff remuneration levels based on salary revisions during JuL-
1973, no increase in subsequent years to 1978 apart from normal
meri.t increments and cost of living allowance adjustments
(according to current practice) which are assumed for each year.
4.  The overall total staff strength and the ratio between monthly
and daily rated categories existing at January 1, 1973, are
maintained.
5.   Material prices increase at 5% per annum, offset by a reduction
in maintenance costs of 1% from 1975 onward due to modernization
and improvements provided by the project.
6.  Additional revenue is secured by tariff increases with effect
from February 1, 1974, as shown in Table 10.
7. Revaluation of fixed assets is not anticipated.
8.  Foreign exchange rate of ISdl-US$2.872 is assumed for debt
service and investments.
9.   The L% p.a. interest rate on Government capital in SRC is
retained.
10. ISd6.01 million of the IDA credit is relent to the SRC on Bank
terms of 25 years repayment including four years grace at 7j%
per annum.

Notes on Railway Traffic Forecasts
A. To Port Sudan:
Cotton: Based on the latest expectations of the Agriculture Miznistry on probable completion
dates for its principal programs and projects which would affect cotton production and export.
Cotton Seed: No increase in exports commensurate with cotton production and exports is
projected since domestic consumption is expected to take up the additional supplies.
Groundnuts, Other Oilseeds and Oilcake:  A small increase is anticipated based on the
Agriculture Nlnistry's plans for production.
Maize and Millets:  Exports are forecast to grow with anticipated growth in domestic production.
Gums: A modest increase is projected.
Fodder: No increase is forecast as domestic livestock will absorb all increases in supplies.
Cement: No increase is expected.
Chrome Ore: A modest increase is projected based on known reserves and existing and potential
production capability. Should planned geological studies identify additional reserves and production
increase as a result, the economies may be such as to make construction of a ferro-chrome plant
close to the mine attractive. Such a plant would reduce the volumes to be moved by the railway.
Miscellaneous: A modest increase is anticipated.
B. From Port Sudan:
Petroleum Products: Forecasts based on refinery and oil companies' plans for production and
distribution. Assumes pipeline operation by mid-1976.
Fertilizers and Insecticides: A moderate increase to cater to expanding farm production is
allowed for.
Wheat: The growth forecast takes into account the changes in food habits currently noticeable
and expected to continue.
Sugar: No growth is forecast as domestic production is expected to cater to the increases in
requiremen=s.
Other Commodities: A moderate growth overall is forecast more or less in line with population
growth.
C. Local Traffic:
Cotton Seed: A steady growth in domestic consumption is expected.
Maize and Millets: Domestic consumption is expected to stabilize at current levels.
Cement: A steady growth is forecast.
Other Commodities: An upward trend in line with past experience is expected.
D. Livestock
A steady increase in livestock exports through Port Sudan is expected.
E. Service
SRC's service traffic is generally based on its forecast of requirements.
