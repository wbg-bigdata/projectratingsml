                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER



  A. SUMMARY

1.     The proposed restructuring seeks the approval of the Regional Vice President
(RVP) to extend the closing dates of the Original Financing (Grant No: H230) and of the
Additional Financing (Grant No: H590) to December 31, 2013, in order to (i) allow
completion of certain Project activities, (ii) reallocate proceeds between disbursement
categories within Grant No. 230, (iii) expand the scope of financing of H590 to
Component 3 (Expansion of Effective Access) of the Project in order to finance civil
works that were initially to be financed from H230, and (iv) adjust the results framework
to amend some targets as commensurate with sectoral progress and to be better aligned
with the slightly adjusted project activities. The proposed restructuring has been
requested by the Government of The Gambia (“Recipient?), in a letter dated November
15, 2012.

2.     The original financing (H230 of SDR 5.6 million – US$8 million equivalent) to
finance the Third Education Project was approved by the Board of Directors on June 1,
2006, became effective on February 28, 2007 with a closing date of March 31, 2011. The
additional financing (H590 of SDR 3.7 million - US$5.5 million equivalent) was
approved by the Board of Executive Directors on June 29, 2010, became effective on July
8, 2010, with a closing date of December 31, 2012. At the time, the closing date of the
Original Financing was extended for 21 months up to December 31, 2012.

3.      During the latest mission supervision carried out in June 2012, it was determined
that there was a financing gap under the Original Financing, due to a previous
reallocation which had decreased the amount planned for civil works for the benefit of
operating costs, which had seen an overrun. While the available amount to construct two
basic cycle schools and eight multigrade schools is US$957,003, the June 2012
supervision mission concluded that US$1.266 million was actually needed to finance the
civil works program, which results in a financing gap of US$308,997.

4.      At the same time, an amount of US$158,792 under the Additional Financing,
which was originally allocated for printing supplementary materials, and materials and
stationary for tutors among others, will not be necessary to support these activities, as
some of the longer term technical assistants are no longer required and thus, these funds
can be made available to finance the school construction gap.


                                           1
5.     The remaining gap in support of civil works will be covered by the Government
Local Funds (GLF) as well as the financing of the boreholes and wells which were
excluded from the estimated US$1.266 million cited in paragraph 3.

Project Status
6.      The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve access of underserved
communities to, and quality of, education in The Gambia, with a particular focus on
primary education (lower-basic education) and teacher quality. With the extension of the
both grants’ closing dates, the PDO continues to be achievable. The Project is currently
rated Moderately Satisfactory with regard to PDO achievement and Implementation
progress. There are no fiduciary or safeguards issues, nor pending audit reports. Under
the original grant, US$7,593,072 or 88.9 percent of a total of US$8 million, and under the
AF, US$3,436,390 or 60.9 percent of total of US$5.5 million have been disbursed as of
November 15, 2012. The overall financial management performance of the Project is
rated Satisfactory as the FM staff in place remains adequate, the bookkeeping is updated
and expenditures are properly justified by supporting documents. Procurement
performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory due to some post review requirements that
were not fully met. As a result, the remaining outstanding contracts will be subject to
prior review, in order to ensure that World Bank procurement guidelines are properly
flowed.

7.    A proposed action plan for the remaining time of Project implementation until
December 2013 was discussed with and provided by the Recipient and accepted by the
Bank.

8.      Results Achieved: With regard to the five PDO indicators, two have already been
met. These are (i) direct project beneficiaries, which have an end target of 8,800, of
which 40% female: there are a total of 14,534 beneficiaries that benefited from the
Project to date (4,839 adult literacy beneficiaries, 529 head teachers, 2,565 teachers in-
service face to face program, 5,598 teachers in in-service teacher training (original IDA)
and 912 education personnel benefited from training at the levels of certificates, bachelor
and master's degrees). The target of 40% of female beneficiaries has been met (current:
40%), and (ii) Learners attending literacy courses that have completed 300 hours which
has an end target of 3,000 has already been exceeded and stands at 4,839 (2,469 in
literacy classes, and 2,370 in post literacy classes of which 95% are female).

9.      Two other indicators are on track and expected to be met by the end of the
Project. These are (i) additional students enrolled in lower-basic education (Grade 1-6) in
targeted under-served areas with an end target of 2,200. The two basic cycle and eight
multi-grade schools will be completed before the end of the Project, and the target will
thus be met by July 2013; and (ii) Targeted teachers obtaining WASSCE credits in
English and/or mathematics with an end target of 30%. The number of teachers sitting
the WASSCE, and passing the WASSCE are key indicators for the in-service training.
The expectation was that in the first cycle of in-service training, 50% of the teachers at
Level 3 would sit the WASSCE, and 30% would pass. From the scores received in the
in-service training program, this target is likely to be met for English, but not for
mathematics this year. To date, 480 out of a total of 651 teachers in level 3 English and
                                            2
 140 out of a total of 525 teachers in level 3mathematics sat for the WASSCE in October
 2012. Since the WASSCE results will become only available in December 2012 it is
 difficult at this stage to predict how much this indicator will progress. The extension of
 the closing date until December 2013 would allow for additional in-service teacher
 training support and the availability of one more cohort of teachers being able to sit for
 the WASSCE.

 10.     The last indicator: completion rate of lower basic education (grade 6) with an end
 target 75%. This indicator is not a project specific indicator but rather a system wide one.
 According to the recent guidelines referring to the core sector indicators (July 2012),
 primary completion rate is a tier 1 indicator and is tracked at the corporate level. Thus the
 decision was made to drop this indicator from the project.

 11.    School improvement subgrants will no longer be financed by the Project because
 the budget support will finance the amount equivalent to informal levies charged by
 schools. Department for International Development - DfiD’s program supported the
 provision of school improvement subgrants until 2010 whilst the Bank conducted an

the government budget and thus no longer financed under the current Project.

          Proposed restructuring of the Additional Financing (H590):

12.     As mentioned above, the freed amount of US$158,792 is available and no cost
overruns are expected under the Additional Financing. Thus, this freed amount will be
redistributed to finance the school construction under the Component 3 of the Project in
order to close the financing gap and ensure that the PDO is achieved. The remaining
expected costs which are to cover the boreholes and wells will be borne by the Recipient
who agreed to cover these costs under the national budget, as per letter from the
Government dated August 28, 2012. In order to prevent a similar scenario from
reoccurring in the future, Project Coordination Unit operating costs will henceforth be
included in the Government budget.

 Project Costs under the Additional Financing (US$)
 Components 1: Improving conditions for teaching and learning
                                                    Current             Proposed

 Components 3: Expansion of Effective Access
 Redistributed to Component 3: Construction of 2 0                      158,792
 basic cycle schools and 8 multigrade schools

13.     Closing date: The extension of the closing date for twelve months from
December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013 will ensure that the construction of two basic
cycle schools and eight multi-grade schools will be completed by the project closing date.
The Project originally had a closing date of March 31, 2011, which was extended to
December 31, 2012 (current closing date) with the AF. For the AF, this is the first
extension.

14.     Implementation arrangements: The name of the implementation agency has
changed from Department of State for Education (DOSE) to Ministry of Basic and
Secondary Education (MOBSE). However, it is solely a name change and it does not
change the arrangements in practical terms. The partnership with the University of The
Gambia has improved over the course of implementation; however, MOBSE has been
taking more of the leadership of the work than originally planned. One of the key ideas
in setting up the partnership was that the expertise of content experts in the university
would be used. However, in practice the design of the modules and the training of tutors
were mainly done by experienced secondary teachers. In the long term, this partnership
may not be the most effective way to conduct this work. Thus it was agreed during the
June 2012 mission to transfer the responsibility originally planned for University of The
Gambia (UTG) to MOBSE.

and two intermediate indicators will be revised and three intermediate indicators will be
dropped in order to better align with the revised education sector program. The details are
described in ANNEX 1: Results Framework and Monitoring.
