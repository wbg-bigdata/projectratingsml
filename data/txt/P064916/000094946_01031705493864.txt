A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The development objective of the proposed project is to improve Nicaragua's disaster management capacity by:
(a) strengthening institutional capability in disaster management at the national level;
(b) building institutional capacity for disaster mitigation at the national level;
(c) promoting disaster awareness and "preventive thinking" through public sector education and awareness
programs;
(d) building local capacity to manage disaster emergencies, to assess risk and to identify mitigation
measures; and
(e) implementing vulnerability reduction and mitigation measures at the local level.
2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
Success in achieving the project's development objective will be assessed by tracking outcome and impact
indicators that measure: increased capacity of the National System for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation and
Response (hereafter "the System" or the "National System") in performing its assigned functions and
responsibilities, improved technical knowledge, increased local government capability for disaster management,
and reduced vulnerability of the population in highly vulnerable municipalities. Outcome indicators include,
inter alia, a fully operational coordinating body for the National System, namely the Executive Secretariat for
Disaster Prevention, Mitigation and Response (hereafter "the Executive Secretariat"), which should have, by the
end of the project, adequate human and physical resources, full funding of its recurrent costs from the national
budget or independent sources, and clear operational and procedural manuals. Performance levels of the
Executive Secretariat, and the National System, will be measured during the life of the project through the
evaluation of selected disaster management activities (including emergency simulation exercises, management
of the emergency operations center, organization of the local disaster management committees, etc.), the
National System's actual emergency responses (if, unfortunately, the occasion arises), and the work of the
National System's intersectoral and territorial commissions.
Project impact will be assessed through evaluations to measure the success of the national disaster awareness
campaign and the mainstreaming of disaster themes in formal education curricula, on the one hand; and througlh
impact evaluations of preventive planning exercises and mitigation measures carried out in the eligible
municipalities, on the other. The latter will look at indicators such as the total number of people targetted in
rural and urban areas, total square kilometers of hazardous areas protected from future development, total
number of schools retrofitted, total cost of investment per capita, etc.
Key output indicators by component are detailed in Annex 1. These include, inter alia, the following: key staff
of the Secretariat identified, hired and trained by the first year of project; new facilities for the Secretariat,
including the Emergency Operations Center, ready by third year of project; vulnerability studies and mitigation
strategies developed for Managua, key watersheds and a review of building codes leading to development of a
national disaster mitigation plan by end of project; 2000 school teachers trained in disaster awareness by end of
project; at least 150 local disaster management committees organized by end of project; hazard and
vulnerability assessments, identification of mitigation measures and preventive planning activities undertaken in
at least 25 eligible municipalities by end of project; and mitigation measures completed in at least 15 eligible
municipalities by end of project.

B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: IDA/R98-32 (IFC/R98-41)         Date of latest CAS discussion: 4/9/98
The proposed project is fully consistent with IDA's emergency and recovery strategy for Nicaragua which was
designed to assist the country in responding to the effects of Hurricane Mitch. That strategy, described and
discussed in the context of the Hurricane Emergency Project approved following the hurricane in December
1998, set out the longer-term objective of supporting the strengthening of Nicaragua's institutional capacity for
disaster preparedness and management, either through a freestanding technical assistance operation or through a
component of an existing or future operation.
The proposed Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project responds to the objectives of IDA's Country Assistance
Strategy through supporting continued economic growth by reducing the toll in lost lives, property and
infrastructure from natural disasters that set back development and cause declines in GDP growth. The most
recent CAS focuses on three core themes: (i) private sector development; (ii) rural sector development and
environmental protection; and (iii) development of human capital and poverty alleviation. The proposed Disaster
Vulnerability Reduction Project is linked to each of these as follows:
i  Private sector developnent Natural disasters cause losses in property, income, and investments as well as
in human lives. The frequency of catastrophic natural events in Nicaragua discourages private sector
investment and hampers its growth. Measures taken to reduce the adverse impact of catastrophic events
would contribute to a more conducive environment for private sector development.
*  Rural sector development and environmentalprotection Like private sector development, rural
development is also set back whenever natural disasters occur. Hurricane Mitch, for example, dealt a major
blow to the agricultural lands, severely damaging export crops, such as bananas, sugar and affecting also the
production of basic grains. Besides providing planning tools and financing mitigation measures to protect
lives and property in vulnerable communities of rural municipalities, the project will also finance an
initiative specifically focused on rural sector development and on environmental protection. A vulnerability
analysis for a major watershed would establish a methodology for watershed management from the point of
view of disaster management and would identify environmental protection measures to reduce disaster
impacts.
*  Poverty alleviation Poor communities are most vulnerable to natural disasters. In Nicaragua, the
communities hardest hit by Hurricane Mitch directly overlap with the priority zones on the country's
poverty map. It is widely recognized that vulnerability to natural disasters reinforces the "vicious circle" of
poverty in Latin America. Mitigation measures can help to break the cycle and to reduce the risk of
accelerated poverty in the event of natural disasters in highly vulnerable communities.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Vulnerability to Natural Disasters:
Nicaragua's history has been punctuated by devastating natural disasters which have set back the country's
social and economic progress. Its geographic location makes it a target for hurricanes, droughts and fires,
volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, and especially severe earthquakes. (Annex 11 includes a chart of recent disasters
in Nicaragua and Annex 4 describes macro-economic effects of Nicaragua's recent disaster history.) Among
Central American countries, Nicaragua stands out in both the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes. On
average, annual deaths due to disasters in Nicaragua stands at some 3,340 between 1970 and 2000, and the
number of persons injured or left homeless runs to some 60,000 per year, according to figures of the
International Red Cross. Each disaster has left the country more vulnerable to the next round of natural



catastrophes. Based on the history of the past 50 years, the International Institute for Advanced Systems
Analysis has estimated that Nicaragua "should expect to lose approximately 0.4% of capital stock, that is 240
million cordobas (20 million USD) annually from natural catastrophes, with possible extreme events reaching
9,600 million cordobas (800 million in USD) in direct losses," assuming that no mitigation measures are
undertaken. National vulnerability to natural disasters thus underlies sector issues listed below.
(1)     Needfor Institutional Coordination for Disaster Prevention, Preparedness and Response
Until now, Nicaragua has had no overall system for disaster management or coordinating agency to
promote disaster prevention and emergency response. It still lacks defined emergency procedures and a
plan for long term disaster mitigation and prevention. Throughout the last 25 years, successive
governments have established structures and laws focused on disaster response, leaving preparedness,
mitigation and prevention unattended. But, as Mitch proved, even with a fairly well trained emergency
search and rescue capability in Civil Defense, the lack of preparedness in the form of an overriding
authority and of established procedures led to costly delays and gaps in the response of organized disaster
response agencies. Moreover, the failure to maintain and train local emergency committees between
disasters has resulted in unnecessary losses in even well-organized communities. While many existing
agencies in public and civil sectors can and should contribute to disaster preparedness and response, from
the fire departments to the church and the Red Cross, a permanently established national agency with
sufficient authority has been urgently needed to assure that efforts are not duplicated, and that all agencies
have a clear notion of their role when a disaster strikes. At the same time, an agency is needed with a clear
mandate to promote and support mitigation and prevention activities both at national and local levels. As
Chart I shows, similar disaster management agencies exist in other countries in the hemisphere. Nicaragua,
with a record of 3-4 major natural disasters occurring per year (as of this writing, 2000 saw major floods
in two areas, a volcanic eruption, and an earthquake) has yet to build up a permanent disaster management
capability as its neighbors have.

(2)    Needfor a National Disaster Mitigation Program and Strategy
Nicaragua has no disaster mitigation programs. This stems in part from the lack of a coordinating disaster
management agency, as mentioned above, but it is reinforced by the fact that sector agencies such as
INETER (Institute for Research on Earth Sciences), MAGFOR (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry), MTI
(Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure) and MARENA (Ministry of Environment and Renewable
Resources) have limited technical capacity to forecast, gather, analyze and share information on natural
hazards. Furthermore, basic studies (vulnerability and policy assessments) need to be carried out in key areas
of: watershed management; building codes; seismic risk (particularly for Managua) and involuntary
resettlement. These studies could lead to development of a national mitigation strategy and programs.
(3)    Public Awareness of Disaster and of Prevention Limited
Notwithstanding the frequency and impact of natural disasters in Nicaragua's national history, disaster
awareness and a "culture of prevention" is largely absent from the formal education system and from the
media. By the same token, few national agencies and ministries take natural disaster emergencies into
account either in their outreach programs or in their internal planning.
(4)    Emergency Preparedness, Hazard Analysis, Vulnerability Assessments not Carried out at Local
Levels.
Despite their vulnerability to disasters, local governments do not include hazard analysis or emergency
preparedness in municipal planning exercises. Local governments in Nicaragua are currently assuming more
responsibilities for their own development planning and, with support from different agencies, are increasingly
identifying and carrying out priority investments for social and environmental needs through participatory
methodologies. Vulnerability analysis, and mitigation actions, however, have yet to be included in the planning
process or among priority investments, as emergency response plans and preparedness have been relegated to
the national agencies. Lacking technical capacity to evaluate risks and to specify appropriate measures, local
governments have not been able to take needed steps to identify areas at risk and to avoid the growth of
settlements in these areas, or to encourage appropriate land use and building standards.
(5)    Lack of Financing for Disaster Mitigation Measures at Local Level
Nicaragua's municipalities continue to depend on national budget transfers and on national programs to finance
investments. Thus, investment financing generally conforms to sector programs set by line Ministries. To date,
these have not included disaster mitigation. Although FISE and INIFOM work closely with local governments
to encourage responsible development planning and a municipal development fund (FONDEM) has recently
been established by INIFOM to assist with income transfers, neither agency includes risk analysis in its planning
procedures. While funding from either institution could be used for disaster mitigation purposes, the traditional
focus on social investments for FISE and environmental and economic development through INIFOM has
tended to undercut possible investments in disaster mitigation measures.
Government Strategy
Following Hurricane Mitch, the Government took decisive measures to reduce Nicaragua's vulnerability to
natural disasters. To deal with the short term, the Government, with help from IDA, identified specific critical
areas endangered in the aftermath of Mitch, and carried out priority mitigation measures through two on-going
projects implemented by FISE and INIFOM (PROTIERRA).
Looking to the long term, the Nicaraguan Government decided to develop a national disaster management
system. With help from UNDP, the Governments of Spain and Colombia, a task force headed by the Vice
President designed a plan for a National System for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation and Response. The plan led
5



to the passage of Law 337 of 2000, published in the National Gazette April 4, 2000 which created the Sistema
Nacional para la Prevenci6n, Mitigaci6n y Atencion a los Desastres (hereafter "the System"). To coordinate
the System's members, the Law established the Executive Secretariat for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation and
Response (hereafter "the Secretariat") lodged within the Office of the Vice-Presidency and appointed an
Executive Secretary, who at the moment is the same person who managed the national response effort during
and immediately after Hurricane Mitch. The regulatory framework required to apply and execute Law 337 was
established through Decree 53/2000, which became effective on June 28, 2000. At the same time, the detailed
responsibilities of all entities comprising the National System were assigned officially through Decree 98/2000
(effective since October 5, 2000).
Among the priority actions identified under the Law #337, the Secretariat is charged with:
*  making the System operational, ensuring appropriate staffing of the Secretariat and of member agencies;
*  preparing and activating a National Emergency Plan, clarifying policies, procedures and standards to be
applied, and training System members in the Plan and, specifically, in their respective roles in disaster
response, prevention and mitigation;
*  establishing a Disaster Management Fund to assure sustained financing for emergency response and relief;
+  establishing and maintaining a data base, supported by geographical information systems (GIS), relevant to
disaster management, including information on hazard and vulnerability assessments, as well as on
programs, projects and actions relevant to disaster prevention, mitigation and response; and
*  establishing and coordinating working committees on sector issues and on territorial issues to support
disaster prevention and mitigation through national agencies and local governments respectively.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project will assist the Nicaraguan government to address the five major sector issues outlined above.
At the national level, it will strengthen disaster prevention, preparedness and response, through support to
the National System and the Executive Secretariat, which will include technical assistance, equipment, key
studies and initial operating costs.
To address the need for a national mitigation strategy, the project will support the System's inter-
institutional commission (which include technical agencies such as INETER, MAGFOR, MARENA and
MTI) through provision of an information management system and through financing of key studies to
define both mitigation policies and future mitigation activities.
Regarding the need to bring disaster awareness into public practice and to civil society, the project will
finance the development and implementation of curricula for the formal education system. It will also
finance a disaster awareness campaign for the general public through the media.
At the local level, the project will support emergency preparedness by assuring the organization, training
and equipping of emergency response committees in all municipalities. In addition, the project will provide
mitigation help to twenty five municipalities, selected as most vulnerable to natural disasters, by carrying
out technically supported risk assessments and vulnerability analyses and subsequently developing
"preventative" land use plans and specific disaster mitigation programs.
Finally, the project will provide financing to implement a small number of high-impact, priority mitigation
measures identified in the twenty five target municipalities. In the process the project will leave a capacity in
place to review such projects technically and environmentally.
Three strategic choices should be mentioned. First, the decision to support a relatively short (three year) project
as a first measure in the longer term goal of making the National System operational, reflects a measured
approach. While a longer project (both as an APL and standard format) was considered, the project team elected
a strategy of attending urgent start up needs, while the System and the Secretariat are still new, with
6



vulnerability assessments and studies which could lead to further support under a possible follow-on operation.
The project strategy also calls for development of plans and studies which could lead to future activities, or
projects, and for an evaluation of the Secretariat's performance at the beginning of the final year of the project.
This evaluation should indicate whether the Secretariat needs additional fortification in disaster management,
particularly disaster preparedness and response, and whether it is ready to undertake major new activities in
mitigation and prevention.
Second, the project has been designed to complement the work of other donors, based on careful review of the
technical assistance for disaster management currently being provided to or planned for the country. In
particular, investments in sophisticated weather and flood monitoring and early alert systems (with the exception
of simple, community managed, systems), which have relatively high operation and maintenance costs, are not
included in the project since several donors - notably Spain, the United States (through USGS and NOAA) and
Finland - have made or will be making contributions in these areas. A matrix in Annex 14 shows donor support
by sector.
Finally, regarding the local vulnerability reduction component, project coverage has been defined following a
careful study of comparative vulnerability among Nicaragua's 151 municipalities (see Annex 13), and an
assessment of institutional capacity within the National System. While a key objective is to cover all the
municipalities in the country in terms of emergency preparedness and response, the complementary but more
costly activities associated with prevention and mitigation will initially be focused on the twenty five most
vulnerable of the country's municipalities. Coverage of the remaining municipalities would be carried out under
a follow-on project or through other donor support.
C. Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):
A. Strengthenina of National System Capacity for Disaster Management
This component would be carried out by the Executive Secretariat through its Planning Department.
It would assure the sustainable establishment of the National System while strengthening its
capacity to respond to, prevent and prepare for natural disasters through the following sub-
components:
A. 1.  Institutional Strengthening of the Executive Secretariat through: (a) Organizational
Development and the Establishment of Capabilities in Planning and Project Management, which
will finance: consultancies to carry out specific tasks for organizational development and project
management; training for Secretariat and System personnel in disaster management and in the
maintenance and use of specialized equipment; and operating costs of the Secretariat on a declining
basis; (b) Improvement of Physical Plant and Equipment which will finance: engineering designs
and the civil works involved in refurbishing a building donated to the National System; purchase
and installation of furnishings and equipment for the Secretariat's use, including computer and
communications systems; purchase and installation of specialized equipment for an Emergency
Operations Center (EOC); and training in the use and maintenance of the EOC.
A.2.  Strengthening of the National System through: (a) Development of National Emergency
Plans, (b) Improving National Emergency Response Capability; and (c) A National Program of
Emergency Simulations. The sub-component will finance consultancies to design procedural guides,
to work out legal agreements, to carry out diagnostics of emergency response equipment, and to
prepare plans and programs under (a) and to assist in design and implementation of simulation
exercises under (c). It will also finance purchase and distribution of emergency response equipment
7



for the National System and of supplies for emergency simulation exercises under (b) and (c).
Finally, it will include training activities in emergency procedures, including disaster simulations, in
the use and maintenance of equipment.
B. Development of National Miti!ation Proaram and Strateg
This component will be the responsibility of the Inter-Institutional Commission of the Executive
Secretariat, which will work closely with technical agencies such as INETER, MAGFOR,
MARENA and MTI. The objective is to improve the capacity of key technical agencies to gather,
analyze and share scientific knowledge and to develop studies leading to the development of
mitigation policies and strategy. In addition to a Sectoral Coordinator to manage the component, the
following sub-components would be financed:
B. I   Mitigation Information System through: (a) consultancies to design and set up an
information management system linking key technical agencies of the National System; and (b)
acquisition and installation of needed hardware and software, and training to staff from the
participating agencies.
B.2    Development of a resettlement policy for application in cases of homes at risk from natural
disasters.
B.3   Strategic Mitigation Studies to define a national mitigation program through consultancies
to: (a) prepare a Seismic vulnerability assessment for Managua; (b) Assess watershed vulnerability
overall and to carry out a pilot mitigation plan in a priority watershed; and (c) Review and update
the national building codes.
B.4   Preparation of a long term National mitigation program and strategy based on findings of
other studies.
B.5   Provision of Expert Technical Assistance in local vulnerability analyses and identification
of mitigation measures in support of sub-component D.2.
C. Building Public Awareness of Disaster Prevention
This component is focused on making disaster prevention a part of daily life and culture and will be
managed by the Public Relations Department of the Executive Secretariat. In addition to a Public
Relations expert to manage the component, various activities under the following sub-components
would be financed:
C. 1   Mainstreaming Disaster Awareness into Formal Education: In conjunction with the Ministry
of Education (Direcci6n Didactica) this sub-component would include: (a) consultancies to update
methodological guides for teachers to design and produce instructive materials for application in
formal school programs; and to evaluate the incorporation of disaster awareness into the formal
education system; and (b) training for teachers in the use of the new methodological guides and
teaching plans.
C.2   Public Awareness Program, covering (a) consultancies to design a public awareness
campaign, including information on disaster management and the National System and to design
graphic, radio and visual programs to promote disaster knowledge; and (b) production of multi-
media materials and dissemination through the media.
8



C.3   Strengthening Disaster Knowledge in the Communications Media through: (a) training for
journalists and communications employees; and (c) consultancies to review and propose reforms in
the education curricula for communications professionals.
D. Strengthenina Local Capacity for Disaster Risk Management
The Territorial Commission of the Executive Secretariat will be responsible for the implementation
of this component, in coordination with local governments, FISE, Civil Defense, and supported by
an advisory group from INETER. In addition to financing a Territorial Coordinator to manage the
component, the sub-components listed below would be financed with the objective of reducing
vulnerability at the municipal level:
D. 1   Consolidation of Committees for Disaster Management. Responsibility for disaster response
in Nicaragua rests with local governments. The objective of this subcomponent is to organize, equip
and train committees for disaster emergency response throughout the country's municipalities. The
Executive Secretariat will work with the Civil Defense in the purchase of emergency response and
disaster prevention equipment (first aid needs, search and rescue materials, communications
equipment and uniforms). It will also finance the Civil Defense to carry out training of two kinds:
(a) organization of the committees, including distribution of equipment for emergency response; and
(b) training in use of equipment and in emergency response including development of local
emergency response plans, and local simulation exercises.
D.2   Promotion of "Preventive Planning." With the objectives of strengthening municipal
planning and technical units in disaster prevention, this component will introduce techniques of
vulnerability assessments and mitigation planning to a pilot group of 25 municipalities, identified as
the most vulnerable to natural disasters. (See Annex 13). Financing under this sub-component will
support consultancies for teams which combine technical expertise in disaster assessments with
experience in participatory planning and community development to (a) carry out hazard analyses,
vulnerability mapping, identification of mitigation measures and prioritization of these measures in
each selected municipality; and (b) prepare long-term land use plans which identify areas at risk and
actions to avoid inappropriate land use in future developments.
E. Implementation of Local Vulnerability Reduction Measures
This component would be the responsibility of FISE, but would be supervised by the Territorial
Coordinator of the Executive Secretariat. Support to FISE for project financial management will be
provided through Component F. FISE will develop annual operating plans in conjunction with the
Territorial Coordinator for municipalities participating in subcomponent D.2 (see above) and will
carry out activities described under the following sub-components:
E. I   Selection of Sub- Proiects and Preparation of Municipal Investment Plan: Following FISE's
normal planning sequencing this component will finance consultancies to supplement FISE's work
with local governments on municipal investment plans (MIP), to prioritize and to incorporate the
mitigation measures identified earlier (under Subcomponent D.2) into the "MIP." FISE's
consultants will also review proposed mitigation measures according to agreed on economic,
technical and financial criteria (see Annex 2 and also Summary Analysis) and select those which are
eligible for implementation.
E.2   Implementation and Evaluation of Mitigation Measures. Measures to be implemented under
this sub-component will be limited to an agreed upon amount in each municipality. Projects should
focus on preventive planning, i.e., limiting future losses by avoiding construction on areas at risk
and on retrofitting key buildings and infrastructure before considering protective works. As such,
9



protective works would be chosen after comparison of costs versus the number of persons and
constructions directly protected. As per FISE's standard implementation practices, this
subcomponent would finance: (a) consultancies to develop engineering designs and bid packages for
mitigation measures and to evaluate the proposed mitigation measures, from technical, financial and
environmental point of view, (including contracting of specialists in the case of protective works, to
assure that adequate standards are applied); and (b) implementation of mitigation measures which
are not on the "negative list" (see Annex 2).
F. Proiect Financial Management
This component refers to the development of project financial administrative capacity to take
responsibility for procurement, contracting and acquisitions, flow of funds, disbursements,
payments, internal and external auditing and financial reporting to IDA. As shown in Annex 6, Chart
6-1, financial administration will be shared between the Public Sector Reform Project Unit -
UCRESEP (components A-D) and FISE (component E), both of which will report to the Planning
Department in the Executive Secretariat, which is charged with project management. Both
UCRESEP and FISE are experienced in financial management and in implementation of IDA
projects. Under this component, the project will finance their additional needs for staffing, office
equipment, hardware and software, and training. Financing will cover costs of: (a) consultancies to
cover additional procurement and accounting needs for UCRESEP; (b) acquisition of software,
computers and office furnishings; and (c) consultancies to cover additional procurement and
accounting needs for the Executive Secretariat.
A projected sequence of activities for each Component and Subcomponent is presented in Annex 2,
Chart 2-2.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The principal institutional reform supported by the project concerns the establishment of the National System
for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation and Response, and of the Executive Secretariat as its coordinating authority.
The creation of a new institution under the Law #337 of 2000 represents an important policy change insofar as
the Executive Branch of National Government has taken responsibility for disaster management and made
preparation and mitigation issues a matter of public sector mandate. Consequent institutional and policy reforms,
as affecting local government jurisdictions and procedures, public sector performance, incorporation of disaster
10



awareness into on-going programs, and private sector involvement will also be promoted through an effectively
established system for disaster prevention, mitigation and response. Annex 12 summarizes a longer institutional
analysis done of the National System as part of project preparation. Chart 2 below shows the conceptual
organization of the National System with the Executive Secretariat at its center.

At present the Secretariat is a small organization with six permanent professional staff and 5 support persons.
One project goal will be to keep the Secretariat small and focused on effective coordination of the existing
agencies that comprise the National System. During project implementation staff will increase to a maximum of
17 professionals, including consultants, and 9 support persons but will drop to a total of I11 professionals and 7
support persons after project completion, as explained in greater detail in Annex 12.
Policy reforms will have greatest impact at the local level. The incorporation of vulnerability analysis and
disaster planning into land use and municipal development plans represents a mnajor reform, as will the adoption
of vulnerability analyses and mitigation measures into municipal planning practices as promoted by FISE.

3. Benefits and target population:
Populations at risk from natural disasters are the target beneficiaries of the project. Given the pattern of natural
events in Nicaragua, most groups living at risk occupy marginal urban settlements and rural communities and
are poor. The selection process used to identify highly vulnerable municipalities included a poverty analysis as
well as hazard risk mapping. (See Annex 13.)
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The Executive Secretariat will be responsible for overall project management and, ultimately, for its successful
implementation. Within the Secretariat, project management will be the direct responsibility of its Planning
Department, as shown in Chart 3, below. The Planning Department of the Secretariat will also be responsible
for the implementation of Component A, relying on its various units, on the Secretariat's Department of Finance
and Administration and on Civil Defense for implementation of specific sub-components as shown in Chart 3.
The remaining project components are each the responsibility of different Departments of the Secretariat or
agencies of the System, as follows: Component B, Sectoral Coordination Department of the Secretariat;
Component C, Public Relations Department of the Secretariat; Component D, Territorial Coordination
Department of the Secretariat; Component E, FISE and Component F, UCRESEP. These departments and
agencies together form the Technical Committee for Project Implementation, which is headed by the Planning
Department of the Executive Secretariat.
Technical Committee members will prepare annual operating plans and budgets, and project progress reports for
submission to the Planning Department of the Secretariat, which will pass them to UCRESEP for use in
financial management. Technical Committee members will also prepare terms of reference for contracts
financed under the project and submit them to the Planing Department of the Secretariat for approval. The
Planning Department will, in turn, pass them to UCRESEP which will obtain a "no objection"' from IDA and
carry out the appropriate procurement process. The Planning Department of the Secretariat is responsible for
passing on approved operating plans, budgets, and terms of reference to UCRESEP in a timely way so that
UCRESEP can manage procurement and financial reporting. The Planning Department of the Secretariat will
receive PMRs (Integrated Project Management Reports) from UCRESEP, review them and share them with
IDA and with the Technical Committee and will also be responsible for presenting semi-annual progress reports
to IDA.

D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Longer Time Frame and Broader Project Scope: Both a longer time frame (five to six years) and broader
project scope (disaster management activities in a majority of Nicaragua's municipalities) were considered
before opting for a short project period (three years) and a more focused approach (helping to start up the
Executive Secretariat on a sustainable path while targeting the country's 25 most vulnerable municipalities for
local mitigation / prevention activities). The alternatives which made for a larger project were rejected, as
explained earlier, due to the fact that consolidation of the System has just begun, and the Secretariat, as its
coordinating body, has not been fully established. In addition, overriding short and medium-term needs must be
attended first in order to improve disaster management capacity effectively. For example, a national disaster
management plan and basic emergency plans and procedures should be prepared, and pilot mitigation and
prevention efforts at the local level must be piloted, before moving into a full-scale mitigation and prevention
effort. There is also the need to consolidate and complement existing scientific knowledge and technical
information currently dispersed across key agencies, to feed into a long term mitigation program and strategy.
The final choice reflects the team's assessment that this first experience will provide an opportunity for the
Secretariat and the System to become firmly established, to learn through various emergency preparedness and
response activities, as well as small scale mitigation experiences, and to evaluate its performance and
incorporate any required changes. This way, the System will progressively become capable of undertaking a
sustainable long range mitigation and prevention program.
Size and Role of the Secretariat: During project preparation several alternative organizational scenarios and
development strategies were developed and analyzed for the National System, and in particular, for the
Executive Secretariat for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation and Response. The model which has been chosen
rejects an initial proposal which called for the creation of regional offices of the Secretariat, plus permanent
information and technical departments for a total of about fifty permanent staff. Instead the project as proposed
designates the Secretariat as coordinator of other agencies and of local governments, comprised of a small core
staff and supported by consultants as needed. On completion of the project, however, the Secretariat will have
developed capability to coordinate disaster response and sectoral and local mitigation and prevention efforts.
Technical Assistance without Civil Works: The decision to include limited financing for civil works in the
project, in addition to technical assistance, responds to several factors. In the first place, Mitch altered river
courses and weakened hillsides in many areas of the country. Adequate reparations have not been taken and
many communities remain vulnerable to a new round of disasters. A second argument comes from both national
and local government representatives in Nicaragua, asking what benefit can come of analyzing risks if
prevention and mitigation measures (structural and non) are not implemented. To this it should be added that
experiences with local planning and investment, even in the recent wake of Mitch suggest that unless funds are
specifically targeted, local governments will postpone investments in disaster mitigation and prevention. Finally,
the proposed project's development objectives will be better served by piloting the National System in its full
role as promoter of disaster mitigation.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Project design and content draw on several lessons learned from the Bank's experience in emergency disaster
operations as well as IDA experiences garnered under the thirteen project portfolio in Nicaragua.
In terms of disaster response operations, ex-post evaluations emphasize the importance of investing in measures
which enable the borrower to better nmtigate the effects offuture disasters. This project will focus significantly
on mitigation and prevention, as distinct from reconstruction (the traditional focus of the Association's post-
disaster projects) and relief (the focus of emergency assistance agencies like the Red Cross). It should result in a
mainstreaming of disaster awareness and disaster prevention measures in local planning and in future IDA
operations as well. Ex-post reviews have made two other strong recommendations for local ownership and for
strong government commitment in project design. In this case, the project has been developed on the basis of
the Nicaraguan government's proposed National Plan for Risk Reduction and in response to a law enacted by
the Congress. The components for municipal investment call for participatory planning to build local ownership
of measures identified and implemented.
A final lesson which emerges from the post-disaster reviews concurs with Association experience in Nicaragua:
strengthening existing institutions rather than creating new ones. In this case, while the National System and
the Executive Secretariat clearly constitute new institutions, the project components for national and local
support will be carried out through existing agencies, through the Executive Secretariat's working groups for
sector issues and for territorial issues. The fortunate existence of strong institutions like FISE, INETER and
Civil Defense working successfully with and through local governments means that the Secretariat can rely on
experienced support and focus on a role as coordinator or emergency response and promoter of long-term
mitigation.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The recent passage of a Law #337 of 2000, creating the National System for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation,
and Response, underlines the Nicaraguan Government's long term commitment to prioritize risk reduction and
natural disaster preparedness. Subsequent to passage of the law, the Secretariat has presented a budget to the
Ministry of Finance for first year operations. In a recent letter to the World Bank of December 14, 2000, The
Minister has reconfirmed Government's intentions to support the full establishment of the National System and
of the Secretariat, and emphasized the importance of the project in a letter to the Country Director (see letter,
Annex 12). The Executive Secretary for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation, and Response has made three trips to
Washington to meet with Bank officials and to discuss project content and scheduling. He and his management
team has also visited Washington and the Bank informally while consulting with other agencies (FEMA,
NOAA, NASA, among others.) During his second visit (November 13 - 17) the Executive Secretary was joined
by the Director of the Planning Department, as well as by the Sectoral and Territorial Coordinators, as well as
by planning directors from FISE, Civil Defense, INETER and UCRESEP.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The Bank will be able to bring technical expertise from other countries and experiences from involvement with
other disaster management projects to help the Nicaraguan government orient its policies and investments. In
addition, IDA support will foment overlap and transference of disaster concerns into other IDA supported
projects related to themes of local development and environmental protection.

E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
The economic benefits of investments in disaster mitigation and prevention are perceived in reduced
losses when catastrophic events occur. While no empirical data is maintained which quantifies the
relationship between investments in preparedness and mitigation and reduced disaster losses,
comparisons of the experiences of developed versus undeveloped countries tends to confirm that prior
investments in response capability and in vulnerability reduction disasters yield extensive returns in
terms of lives saved and property damage avoided. Investments in mitigation, (structural and non-
structural measures) and in emergency response have been identified under the project according to
their high impact on avoided losses of life and property, as discussed below and in Annex 4. Additional
investments, to be proposed by municipalities, would be analyzed individually in terms of costs versus
disaster insurance premiums.
The history of Central America and, in particular, Nicaragua, repeatedly attest to the high cost of
natural disasters, and to the fact that losses and impact is heightened by lack of investments in
preparedness and mitigation. Nicaragua, in particular, has been hit by two major hurricanes in the past
five years (Joan and Mitch, classified as catastrophic or one hundred to one thousand year events), by a
volcano, and forest fires. Recovery will be difficult in a country still feeling the combined effects of a
debilitating earthquake and war during the 1970s and 1980s respectively. The actual price paid by
Nicaragua for not investing in disaster management is detailed in a "Case Study of Natural Catastrophe
Risk in Nicaragua" by Paul K. Freeman, Landis MacKellar, Leslie Martin, Reinhard Mechler and Koko
Warner of the International Institute for Advanced Systems Analysis, commissioned as part of project
preparation on file. As mentioned earlier in section B.2, the study concludes that annualized exposure
to catastrophic events represents a total value of US$20 million/year or 0.4% of capital stock. It also
concludes that failing to account for natural catastrophes means overstating GDP levels each year by
240 million Cordoba or by 0.4%. Failing to account for natural catastrophes also leads to
underestimating future debt service payments each year by US$300 million.
Summary of Benefits and Costs:
Investment in mitigation can take two forms: structural measures and non-structural measures. The benefits
of certain structural measures have been analyzed in the Caribbean. A draft OAS review of the return on
investments in disaster resistant structures implies that the payoffs from investment in mitigation are high. In
a recent study of natural catastrophes in the Caribbean, John Pollner cites estimates from civil engineering
experts to the effect that, on average, an increased investment in vulnerability reduction measures of 1% of a
structure's costs will reduce the "probable maximum loss" from wind damage by at least one third. Detailed
data suggests that retrofitting residential buildings at costs running from 1.8% to 3.4% of total building
value, will reduce "probable maximum loss" by 50%. For commercial buildings the same impact is expected
from investments of 2.0% - 3.8% in structural retrofitting.
Non-structural measures were the subject of a second study undertaken as part of project preparation. Using
data from losses after Mitch in Central America Professor Harold Cochran of the University of Colorado at
Boulder proposed three damage functions: property damage, lives lost and casualties, examined in scenarios
with and without mitigation measures and concluded that hazard mapping and land use restrictions as the
areas of highest impact for investment in disaster mitigation by a rate of return on the order of 180%. His
findings suggest that some US$ 800 million in property loss could be avoided over the next forty years
merely by avoiding settlement on land susceptible to flooding and landslides.
17



A summary analysis of returns on project investments appears in Annex 4. It concludes that:
*  Because this is one of the country's first initiatives in disaster management it would address the protection
measures that have the larger payoff. For instance following the findings of a Cochran's study, the project
investments are focused on preventative planning and avoiding growth in areas at risk, including flood
prone areas, areas susceptible to landslide, and to volcanic, seismic and wind events. This measures can
render an IRR of 25% or more.
*  Furthermore, where amenable, the project will perform cost benefit analysis of sub-components, like in the
case of protective investments for specific buildings and other investment proposals in mitigation measures
(with the exception of the pre-established investments under Component 5)
*  Finally considering the disaster-related indirect costs this project has the potential to reduce by '/4
Nicaragua's annual need of external financing for post-disaster reconstruction, and to cut by half the risk of
setbacks in GDP growth and poverty alleviation that natural disasters entail.
2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
The main assumptions relating to project financing of the project are described in Annex 6.
Fiscal Impact:
Project funds will be distributed as follows:
5 1% to local governments for risk analysis, emergency planning and mitigation measures
27% to the Executive Secretariat for investments, technical assistance and training
14% to national agencies for developing long term mitigation plans for mainstreaming disaster awareness
into on-going programs
5% for Project Financial Administration
3% to the Executive Secretariat for recurrent costs
The greatest portion of funds will be directed at measures which translate into avoided losses of lives and
property during natural disasters.
As is in the interest of developing the newly created National System for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation
and Response, the project will contribute to the annual operating costs of the Executive Secretariat on a
declining basis, as follows: 60% of the annual budget request presented to the Ministry of Finance during the
fiscal year prior to project effectiveness, to a maximum amount equivalent to US$ 300,000; 40% of the
annual budget request presented to the Ministry of Finance during the first fiscal year of project
effectiveness to a maximum amount equivalent to US$ 200,000; and 20% of the annual budget request
presented to the Ministry of Finance during the second fiscal year of project effectiveness to a maximum
amount equivalent to US$ 100,000.
Recurrent costs represent 11% of project costs. Of these 72% will be borne by the Government as its
counterpart contribution.
3. Technical:
Specialized technical expertise will be required under Components D and E (Strengthening Local Capacity
for Disaster Risk Management and Implementation of Local Vulnerability Reduction Measures) to assist in
vulnerability analysis and risk mapping at the local level and to assess the financial, environmental and
structural feasibility of sub-projects proposed. For the vulnerability analyses and risk mapping, as well as for
the review of proposed mitigation works from the point of view of structural resistance to disasters, a team of
expert advisors will be provided under the project. They will work with technicians from relevant
Nicaraguan institutions (INETER, MTI, MAGFOR) offering technical advice to planning teams
collaborating with local governments. Regarding design and implementation of mitigation works, standard
designs have been prepared for certain works and costs estimates prepared (parks, playing fields and
18



alternative uses for areas at risk, retrofitting of schools, and of medical centers), while standard procedures
have been developed for technical, environmental and cost reviews have been elaborated for other works.
The range of works and different review procedures are indicated in Annex 2, Table 2-1 under Component E.
For the most part, however, the project will rely on standard procedures applied by FISE for technical and
environmental reviews of proposed works. FISE has ample experience with local works and have received
positive evaluations from the Association. As a condition of credit effectiveness, FISE will present complete
guidelines for sub-project evaluation for inclusion in the project operations manual.
4. Institutional:
4.1 Executing agencies:
The principal executing agency, The Executive Secretariat for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation and Response
has been in existence only since April, 2000 and will be a principal beneficiary of this project in terms of its
own institutional development. Insofar as it is housed in the Vice-Presidency of the Republic with strong,
experienced leadership which enjoys support from the executive branch, the Executive Secretariat's staff and
position counterbalance certain risks stemming from its lack of institutional history. The Executive
Secretariat will require close supervision during project implementation, although it will rely on support
from other agencies: UCRESEP, in particular, will manage financial administration; FISE, will carry out
civil works; INETER; and the Civil Defense which have long experience in disaster information gathering
and in emergency response, respectively.
4.2 Project management:
The National System for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation and Response consists of key ministries and
agencies (including NGOs and private sector companies) which participate according to their particular
areas of strength. The Executive Secretariat will channel financing through key agencies. Since most such
agencies are well known to the Association through other projects, the main institutional issue concerns
the capacity of the Executive Secretariat to effectively coordinate and build consensus and to manage the
project while also establishing its role in disaster management.
4.3 Procurement issues:
Assessments of procurement and financial management capability in FISE and UCRESEP have been carried
out by Bank specialists prior to appraisal. Both FISE and UCRESEP are currently managing IDA credits and
have recently had positive assessments of their work. While no major problems are foreseen, a re-assessment
of UCRESEP after six months of project implementation has been recommended. Given its current
commitments, UCRESEP will be supporting three IDA projects during the next three years. Financing is
included for two persons to assist in the procurement process, and for training and software to upgrade to an
integrated project management capability. A re-assessment should re-examine whether additional staffing or
training is required to manage the financial aspects of the project.
4.4 Financial management issues:
Both UCRESEP and FISE, as financial managers of the project, have presented plans to become LACI
compliant prior to loan effectiveness. The Secretariat will be responsible for receiving and reviewing project
management reports and procurement of technical assistance, goods and services as prepared by UCRESEP.
Flow of funds is shown in Chart 6-1 in Annex 6.
19



5. Environmental:                  Environmental Category: B (Partial Assessment)
The project is considered to be a Category "B" project, as recommended by the QAT clearance memo dated
July 6, 1999. The majority of civil works will involve restoration and protection of the environment,
retrofitting of existing infrastructure, and are not expected to have any negative environmental effects.
Although the project will not finance any physical resettlement, only feasibility studies and cost estimates,
the Government's policy guidelines, and experience in resettlement will be analyzed in Component B as part
of a study to develop a resettlement policy acceptable to the Association.
As the agency charged with implementing Component E, FISE will be charged with assuring that no adverse
environmental impact results from the mitigation measures. FISE's task will be aided in part by the
maximum of US$100,000. for expenditure on any one municipality, which necessarily limits the size and
impact of projects. Furthermore, FISE will implement only projects which do not appear on the "negative
list" (shown in Annex 2) and which are in compliance with a checklist requiring impact analysis of certain
types of projects. The checklist, which appears in Annex 2, shows projects which require independent
environmental assessments. As noted, the majority - expected to comprise all of the sub-projects - conform
to standard works with no adverse environmental impacts.
Through experience acquired in the implementation of past and on-going operations, FISE is well aware of
the Bank's policy on environmental impact and FISE has already established a capable staff and adequate
procedures to evaluate environmental risks linked to sub-projects. Its Environmental Unit has been in place
since 1997, staffed by three professionals (two environmental engineers and one ecologist) who are
responsible for monitoring environmental issues. Among other tasks, this unit is responsible for: (a) review
of a sample of projects (both desktop and in the field) to ensure that environmental impacts are identified and
mitigated throughout all stages of the project cycle; (b) reviewing proposals for projects that have more
significant environmental impacts (i.e., water and sanitation, roads, etc.); (c) designing and managing
environmental projects (reforestation, watershed protection, and solid waste management); (d) providing
training to both FISE staff and external supervisors in environmental impact assessment and mitigation; (e)
producing monthly reports on the state of environmental issues related to the FISE. The Association has
regularly supervised this system, such as under the Nicaragua Poverty Reduction and Local Development
Project, and found it adequate, meeting IDA requirements, as provided for in OP 4.01 paragraph 9 (January,
1999).
As part of the recently negotiated FISE operation, FISE's Environmental Unit (UA) is finalizing
environmental indictors to be incorporated into its overall Management Information System (MIS). The
FISE credit effectiveness for the Poverty Reduction and Local Development Project (FISE V) requires
further that these indicators be finalized and agreed with the Association and incorporated into FISE's
MIS. The indicators would be ready in time to be used to monitor and evaluate environmental impact of
the Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project.
6. Social:
6.1 Key social issues:
No major social issues are foreseen. Ongoing research suggests that disaster impacts may be felt differently by
gender and by indigenous groups. Annex 12 describes the concerns for gender impact which will be taken into
consideration in participatory planning exercises. As regards indigenous people, all the components of the
project, specially C and D will be developed considering the multiethnic and multicultural characteristics of the
country and of each municipality. In component C, the media will be selected and the messages will be
designed according to the language and cultural characteristics of target communities. In component D the
strengthening of local capacity for disaster risk management will be carried out through a broad participation of
all the different ethnic groups.
20



The project will foster the definition and official adoption of a policy for resettlement to reduce disaster risk,
but does not at this time include resettlement. Land tenure will not be affected per se, although in providing
maps, vulnerability assessments and land use plans for undeveloped land, future urbanization patterns will be
affected. The results should be positive, insofar as preventive planning promotes identification and
urbanization of adequate supplies of land not at risk or environmentally sensitive to accommodate new
population growth.
The primary beneficiaries: communities at risk, local authorities, and local civil society will be involved in
and will sign off on local risk assessments, on emergency preparation plans, and on preventive development
plans and proposals for mitigation works which are identified. Procedures have been defined to merge
vulnerability mapping and risk assessment into the participatory planning exercises carried out by FISE as a
key step in defining its municipal investment plans. Evaluation of the experience of the Technical Team for
Rapid Response (which visited some 40 communities at risk of floods and landslides before the 1999 rainy
and hurricane season) has indicated that projects which were "imposed" by experts without participation
from local authorities and communities were rarely and poorly maintained.
Efforts will be made to ensure a gender-sensitive approach to the participatory process. Studies have
shown that including men and women together in the participatory process stirnulates effective
coordination between the sexes in the disaster emergency phase, and results in more effective coping
strategies for disaster prevention and mitigation (see Annex 15 for additional information on gender
and disaster). This gender-conscious approach has been applied to a similar disaster mitigation
project in Honduras, with positive initial results.
6.2 How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society organizations?
NGOs are foreseen as likely participants in participatory planning exercises designed to bring communities
and local governments together to identify priority mitigation measures under component 4. Annex 14 lists
donor agencies and relevant ongoing projects in Nicaragua.

F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Sustainability of project objectives depends on two key variables; one the successful mainstreaming of
disaster awareness concerns into operations by other Ministries and agencies; and two, the ability of the
National System to operate during and beyond the next two presidential administrations. Regarding the
first, supervision teams from both this and other projects should review the adoption of risk analysis and
disaster planning in standard municipal development plans, and in the participatory planning exercises
21



carried out by FISE and local governments in all municipalities. Continued IDA involvement in
decentralization projects and in participatory planning exercises will certainly encourage the sustained
application of disaster analysis and mitigation to local governments. Regarding the second, the three year
implementation period should give a clear impetus for establishing the Secretariat and the System it
coordinates.

Annex 2: Detailed Project Description
NICARAGUA: Natural Disaster Vulnerability Reduction
A detailed breakdown of costs with contingencies is presented at the end of this annex.
Project Component A - US$4.82 million
Strengthening of National System Capacity for Disaster Management
The need to coordinate sector and local efforts to establish and implement prevention and mitigation policies,
programs and projects, and to improve disaster preparedness and response, led the Government of Nicaragua
to enact Law # 337 in April 2000, which created the National System for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation,
and Response (the National System). While in the past the emphasis had been disaster response and relief,
the newly established System, as its name indicates, has a mandate that covers all the phases of the disaster
management cycle, and a clear goal of reducing vulnerability to natural disasters. The System brings
together government actors at all levels (sector agencies at ministerial level, regional and municipal
authorities), and representatives of private sector and NGOs. Law 337 also created the Executive Secretariat
of the National System for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation, and Response (the Executive Secretariat), a
centralized coordinating body to guide and focus the work and activities of the various participants in the
National System (Annex 12 describes the institutional history of disaster management in Nicaragua). The
Executive Secretariat is located in the Office of the Vice Presidency, and is intended to provide the
coordinating capability to mobilize the System, and to promote disaster management though varied
initiatives. The Executive Secretariat is part of the central nucleus of the System, which also includes the
National Committee (a political body), INETER (a decentralized entity under the Presidency of the
Republic), and the Civil Defense (under the Army of Nicaragua).
The objective of this component is to strengthen the institutional and organizational capacity of the National
System, to assure its sustainability and, in particular, to establish the Secretariat as System coordinator and to
support selected core agencies so that they can begin to fulfill their assigned roles and responsibilities.
Implementation of the component is the direct responsibility of the Planning Department of the Executive
Secretariat, with support from other offices, departments and agencies as noted. The component will carry
out the following activities through two sub-components.
Sub-component A.1: Institutional Strengthening of the Executive Secretariat
This sub-component will build capacity within the Executive Secretariat to coordinate the National
System, including the overall planning, coordination and supervision of matters related to disaster
prevention, mitigation, preparedness and response, as defined by Law 337. It will also support the
Executive Secretariat's management capability to carry out the project. Under this sub-component,
the project will finance consultants, equipment purchase and installation, civil works and training as
noted beneath each activity.
(a) Organizational Development and the Establishment of Capabilities in Planning and
Project Management
This activity, under the aegis of the Executive Secretariat's Planning Department will
promote and sustain five specific programs throughout the project: Legal, International
Cooperation and Sustainable Financing, Information Systems, Norms and Procedures, and
Internal and Inter-institutional Training. Specific tasks for each program include,
respectively: (i) Coordination of legal aspects of institutional responsibilities of the National
System, including the design, setting-up and regulation of the National Disaster Fund,
regulations for sector work commissions, and assistance in legal matters related to Law 337;
(ii) Design and development of a Central American and hemispheric relations program, and
28



of a strategy to promote external financing; (iii) Definition of standards and procedures,
including production and distribution of operations manuals, and maintenance and
evaluation of an inventory of the National System's emergency response equipment and
supplies; (iv) Development of information systems, including a web page for the Secretariat,
a data base on natural disasters for Nicaragua, damage assessments, and a system for
management of operational information; and (v) Professional training and development,
including a risk management library and data base, and preparation and supervision of
training plans.
The project will contribute to costs of consultants to carry out activities (i), (ii), (iii) and data
management implied in (iv). It will also cover training costs under (v).
As it is in the interest of developing the newly created National System for Disaster
Prevention, Mitigation and Response, the project will also contribute to the annual operating
costs of the Executive Secretariat on a declining basis, as follows: 60% of the annual budget
request presented to the Ministry of Finance during the fiscal year prior to project
effectiveness, to a maximum amount equivalent to US$ 300,000; 40% of the annual budget
request presented to the Ministry of Finance during the first fiscal year of project
effectiveness to a maximum amount equivalent to US$ 200,000; and 20% of the annual
budget request presented to the Ministry of Finance during the second fiscal year of project
effectiveness to a maximum amount equivalent to US$ 100,000.
(b) Improvement of Physical Plant and Equipment
Supervised by the Planning Department, but under the direction of the Department of
Administration and Finance, this activity will provide the Executive Secretariat with
adequate facilities and equipment for its operation, covering: (i) Rehabilitation of a building
donated by the National Government to the National System, conditional on the titling (or
long term leasing) by the National System, to provide office space for the National System,
including, inter alia, headquarters and office space for the Executive Secretariat and for the
sector working groups, and for the Disaster Management Operations Center (DMOC)
(indicative cost US$0.8 million) and (ii) Provision of equipment and vehicles for the
Secretariat, including office equipment, furniture, and files for a staff of 28; computers,
software and printers; and 6 small trucks.
Under (i) the Project will provide financing for the necessary engineering designs and civil
works. Under (ii) it will finance purchase and installation or distribution of goods.
Sub-component A.2: Strengthening the National System
The activities included in this sub-component aim at improving the National System's operational
capacity, especially its emergency preparedness and response capacity. Although the Executive
Secretariat's Planning Department is directly responsible for implementation of this component, it
will receive support from other agencies and Departments as noted.
This sub-component will finance: consultants to develop a National Emergency Plan, including
procedural guides and legal agreements, and emergency response equipment diagnostics and to assist
in design and implementation of simulation exercises under activity (c); training in emergency
procedures, including disaster simulations, in equipment maintenance and use under activity (c); and
(c) acquisition of emergency response equipment for the National System under (b) and of supplies
for emergency simulation exercises under (c) as described below.
29



(a) Development of National Emergency Plans
Under this activity, the direction of the Planning Department will manage consultants to
design a National Emergency Response Plan, counting on assistance from international
experts and will include publication of 2,500 copies of the plan itself and of instruction
guides for application. The plan will be prepared through a consultation process involving
key preparedness and response agencies, NGOs, and other concerned stakeholders.
(b) Improving Emergency Response Capacity
In order to improve emergency preparedness and response capacity of the National System,
the following tasks will be implemented: Acquisition of needed emergency equipment,
following an inventory and diagnostic carried out by consultants for an inter-agency task
force. The Department of Administration and Finance in the Executive Secretariat will be
responsible for this activity, although the diagnostic would be under the aegis of the Office
of Norms and Procedures, and both will report to the Planning Department. The same
inventory/diagnostic would identify emergency response equipment needs for key search,
rescue and first aid agencies (Volunteer Fire Brigades, National Fire brigades Police, Civil
Defense). Following the completion of the diagnostic, The Department of Administration
and Finance in the Executive Secretariat, under the coordination of the Planning
Department, would purchase equipment (mainly shelter supplies, search and rescue, and
communications equipment, no vehicles) for the use of agencies members of the National
System, under the responsibility of the Office of Norms and Procedures. As a condition for
disbursement against the purchase of emergepcy equipment, the Secretariat will present a
plan for storage, maintenance, distribution and utilization of all emergency response
equipment acceptable to the Association and will enter into such legal agreements with
agencies and members of the National System as the Association requires to assure
appropriate usage of emergency equipment to be purchased. Equipment to be provided under
this task can include, but would not necessarily be limited to the following items:
- Personal protection equipment such as: life vests, hard hats, boots, smoke masks, gas
masks, harnesses, oxygen tanks
- Underwater rescue equipment: diving equipment, motor boats
- Fire and explosive protection: liquid foams; portable water pumps
- Electrical generators and solar energy plants
- Sirens
- Communications equipment
- Rescue equipment (brake bars, ropes, pulleys and rappel lines, carabiners, gate openings,
gurney and stretchers, portable resuscitation systems, rescue and retrieval systems for
combined spaces, Petzl Hanoled Ascenders, rechargeable flashlights, portable rescue saws,
hot line cutters, extrication and rescue tools, lifting bags, rescue pulleys, multi-purpose gas
detector, water containers, portable winches)
Tents and mobile shelters, sleeping bags, foam mattresses, army kitchen, camping trailers,
portable johns and shelters.
(c) National Program of Emergency Simulations
Under this activity, administered by Civil Defense, four emergency simulations will be
carried out at the national level as follows: one in year one, two in year two, and one in year
three. Tasks include contracting international and national experts to design simulation
exercises, development and purchase of special equipment, including computers, software,
communication equipment, office equipment, etc., training in the operation of the EOC and
30



the use and maintenance of key equipment, mobilization of National System personnel
engaged in the exercises, and evaluations of the exercises.
Project Component B - US$1.65 million
Development of a National Mitigation Program and Strategy
This component will be the responsibility of the Inter-Institutional Commission of the Executive Secretariat,
which will work closely with technical agencies such as INETER, MAGFOR, MARENA and MTI. The
objective is to improve the capacity of key technical agencies to gather, analyze and share scientific
knowledge and to develop studies leading to the development of mitigation policies and strategy. In addition
to a Sector Coordinator of the Executive Secretariat, whose costs are included under this component to
manage the component, the following sub-components would be fnanced:
Sub-component B. 1: Design of a Mitigation Information System
The objective of this sub-component is to promote information sharing across key technical and
scientific agencies of the National System, such as INETER, MAGFOR and MARENA, and
facilitate consolidation and dissemination of existing knowledge. It will finance consultants to
identify needs and to design an information management system linking key technical agencies of
the National System (principally the Secretaria Ejecutiva, MAGFOR, MARENA, MTI, INETER,
and Defensa Civil.) Under this sub-component information experts would be contracted to review
and identify, inter alia, information needs, existing systems to be made compatible and protocols to
be designed to permit necessary sharing of information for disaster management and mitigation
planning.
Sub-component B.2: Development of a National Policy for Involuntary Resettlement to Reduce
Risk from Natural Disasters
Focusing on the possibility of involuntary resettlement from areas at risk, this activity will generate
an involuntary resettlement policy acceptable to the Government of Nicaragua, in accordance with
the directives of the IDA, following: (i) A diagnostic study to identify national resettlement
experiences; (ii) development of a policy, including strategies, methodologies, procedures, and
design of institutional arrangements to carry out resettlement of persons at risk of natural hazards;
(iii) Workshops to obtain the input and support of agencies and sectors of civil society in the
formulation of the policy for involuntary resettlement from areas at risk; and (iv) Development of a
strategic plan to make the new policy operational. International experts will help the Executive
Secretariat and an advisory group comprised of INIFOM, AMUNIC and relevant ministries in the
development of this policy.
Sub-component B.3: Strategic Mitigation Studies
The activities of this sub-component are designed to produce information vital to the advancement of
mitigation efforts for both practical program identification and policy development. It will be based
on consultancies to carry out key studies to define a national mitigation program. Disbursement for
these activities will be conditional on approval of an action plan showing a detailed description and
phasing of sub-activities and tasks and indicating the agencies' and sub-departments responsible for
each. Specific activities follow:
(a) Vulnerability Assessment of Managua
Managua houses 20% of Nicaragua's population. The city has been hit by two serious
earthquakes in this century. Three recent studies (two with funding from Norway and
31



Sweden, one nationally financed) have analyzed and quantified risk factors (soil and slope
conditions, micro-zoning and flood hazards) but none, as yet, has mapped and/or quantified
the precise neighborhoods and buildings at risk. A full vulnerability assessment is therefore
proposed which will analyze the resistance factors of existing buildings and designate
standards for developing areas. It will take special account of lifeline infrastructure
(hospitals, schools, public refuge, water and electricity mains), their construction quality and
needs for retrofitting. This activity will develop a methodology to apply to Managua (and to
other municipalities in Nicaragua) to analyze existing and future building patterns and to
produce seismic risk maps and retrofitting plans following the information from micro-
zoning and other studies.
(b) Watershed Vulnerability - Overall Review and Pilot Assessment
Accumulated natural phenomena combined with deforestation and road construction, among
other factors, have made Nicaragua's watersheds increasingly susceptible to flooding and to
landslides. Hurricane Mitch both revealed and increased their vulnerability as it changed
river beds and destabilized slopes. A comprehensive review of Nicaragua's watersheds has
never been carried out, although INETER now has information available to allow a
comparison of vulnerability and identification of affected watersheds, prior and post-Mitch.
Identification of the watersheds at greatest risk, would be the first phase of the proposed
study. As a second phase of this activity, INETER proposes to carry out a detailed
assessment of vulnerability in a particular watershed (of the Estero Real River) to develop a
replicable methodology for identifying and mapping areas at risk and for providing local
governments and communities with information and disaster mitigation planning assistance.
(c) Review and Revision of National Building Codes
Nicaragua's building code dates from 1983, based mainly on analyses carried out following
the Managua earthquake of 1972. Since then additional data has been gathered concerning
geomorphologic conditions in different parts of the country. Also, subsequent events have
changed requirements for construction standards. Using information developed from micro-
zoning maps and vulnerability studies by INETER, the MTI proposes to carry out a review
and up-date of Nicaragua's building codes. This activity involves development of new
minimum standards for construction in concrete, masonry, steel, wood and adobe (earth) as
well as the introduction of new regulations for training and preparing not only formal sector
construction companies and engineering consultants, but also informal builders. Among
other deliverables, this activity would produce: an updated national map showing risk areas
anid code applications for seismic risk, volcanic risk, wind event risks, guidelines for
structural calculations for construction in concrete, masonry, steel, wood and adobe (earth)
buildings, and a micro-zoning map for seismic risk in Managua.
Sub-component B.4: Preparation of National Mitigation Program and Strategy
Using the results of the foregoing studies, plus short-term local and international consultants, the
Department of Planning of the Executive Secretariat will develop a long term plan to promote
disaster mitigation in Nicaragua in the third year of project implementation. An action plan to
develop such a program will be presented to the Association prior to disbursement for this activity
which will include workshops to discuss and promote the objectives of the program and its strategy.
32



Sub-component B.5: Expert Technical Assistance in Vulnerability Analysis
Studies proposed above and vulnerability analyses to be carried out under other components,
specifically D.4 will require technical advice from experts in hydrology, geology and related earth
sciences. This activity will finance input from experts to assist in reviewing risk assessments,
studies, proposals and terms of reference as well as training INETER professionals in disaster risk
assessment and mitigation planning.
Project Component C - US$ 0.97 million
Building Public Awareness of Disaster Prevention
This component is focused on making disaster prevention a part of daily life and culture and will be managed
by the Public Relations Department of the Executive Secretariat. In addition to a Public Relations expert to
manage the component, various activities under the following sub-components would be financed:
Sub-component C.1: Updating Formal Education Curricula on Disasters
The Secretariat will work in conjunction with the Ministry of Education (Direcci6n Didactica) to
implement this sub-component, which would include the following. To the degree in which
instruction is offered indigenous languages, materials and programs will be developed accordingly:
(a) Updating of Methodological Guides for Teachers
The Ministry of Education prepared a Methodological Guide for Teachers on Disasters in
1994, which preceded the enactment of Law 337, and thus is in need of updating. Moreover,
based on its previous limited application, several changes have been identified. This activity
will include updating of the guide with the help of international experts, as well as the
graphic design and publication of the new guides. The preparation of the new guide will be
coordinated with the design and production of instructive materials discussed under Activity
(c) below.
(b) Training for Teachers
Teachers from primary and secondary schools will be trained in the use of new
methodological guides and instructive materials, and in innovative ways to educate kids and
young adults on disaster management and its relevance for a country like Nicaragua. The
activity involves the design and implementation of a training program through which
teachers will be presented with new or revised techniques and methodologies, based on a
review of lessons learned from previous experiences in Nicaragua and other countries in the
region. Special attention will be given to techniques and methodologies that focus on hands-
on and interactive educational tools.
(c) Design and Production of Instructive Materials
This activity includes an assessment of instructive materials that have been used in
Nicaragua and other countries in the region; and design, production and dissemination of
revised and/or new instructive materials considered adequate for the new methodologies and
techniques to be applied by teachers.
33



(d) Impact Evaluation and Exchange of Experiences in the Formal Education System
This activity includes the following tasks: (i) follow up and impact evaluation of the use of
the new guideline, instructive materials and educational techniques. This task will be carried
out by international experts; (ii) exchange of experiences with other countries; and (iii)
implementation of a pilot project in 5 schools to promote involvement of students in
community-based disaster management efforts.
Sub-component C.2: Public Awareness Program
The purpose of this sub-component is to bring a basic awareness of disasters and better
understanding of mitigation and prevention activities which can be taken from the household to the
public at large, through extensive publicity and media campaigns. This program should take into
account cultural and language differences to fully and adequately include indigenous peoples. In
addition to financing a director for the office of Public Relations, activities under this sub-
component include:
(a) Design and Development of a Communications Strategy
Based on a recently completed study financed by the Inter-American Development Bank and
CEPREDENAC, and taking into account the various hazards prevalent in the country, a
Communications Strategy will be developed to guide the implementation of periodic public
awareness programs. The objective of the strategy will be to promote a "Culture of
Prevention" in Nicaragua. As such, the strategy's design should: assess risk perception of
the public at large, identify the main factors affecting risk perception (positively and
negatively); and identify adequate ways to validate local knowledge and introduce scientific
knowledge and technical information. The strategy should provide specific measures to
reach out clearly identified target audiences, and will identify indicators to measure its
impact. Due to its nature, this activity will be carry out by a multidisciplinary team of
international and national experts.
(b) Production and Dissemination of Materials
This activity includes the following tasks: (i) preparation of a production plan in close
coordination with the Communication Strategy. This plan, to be prepared by a consultant
firm, will identify the type and amount of materials required to undertake the first public
awareness program. These materials include videos, audio messages, posters, etc. (ii)
design and production of materials; and (iii) dissemination through the recommended
medium (TV, radio, newspapers, etc.).
Sub-component C.3: Strengthening Disaster Awareness in the Communications Media
Focused on improving relations with the press and the public, this sub-component will strengthen the
communications capacity of the National System, and promote disaster awareness in the
communications media through:
(a) Production and Dissemination of Information on Risk Analysis
This activity involves design and production of a set of official materials related to disaster
management to be distributed by the Secretariat's Public Relations Department and other key
agencies of the National System to journalists, decision makers, private sector
representatives, and civil society groups, to ensure that a consistent and informative message
34



will be disseminated. Official materials will include, inter alia, updates on the various
activities implemented by the Secretariat and other key agencies, information on natural
hazards in Nicaragua, opportunities for risk reduction, and success stories related to
prevention and mitigation.
(b) Training for Journalists and Communications Employees
Under this activity, the Project will support the organization of a series of workshops at the
national and regional levels for journalists and communications employees. The objective of
the activity is to familiarize journalists and communications specialists with basic concepts
related to disaster management, with the role that the media can play in developing a
"Culture of Prevention" in the country, and with ways to improve reporting of emergencies
and disaster prevention activities.
(c) Review and Reform of Education Curricula for Communications Professionals
With the help of experts, a review of existing curricula in journalism and communication
schools in the country and the region will be undertaken, identifying any previous efforts to
introduce the disaster management theme. The consultants selected for this activity will also
provide recommendations on how to proceed to promote the introduction of the disaster
management theme in the curricula of journalism schools, especially those located in public
universities.
Project Component D - US$3.69 million
Strengthening Local Capacity for Disaster Risk Management
The Territorial Commission of the Executive Secretariat will be responsible for the implementation of this
component. Local governments will be the main partners, supported by FISE, Civil Defense and the
advisory group from INETER. In addition to financing a Territorial Coordinator (US$ 0.2 million) to
manage the component, the sub-components listed below would be financed with the objective of reducing
disaster risks at the municipal level:
Sub-component D.1: Consolidation of Committees for Disaster Management
This sub-component supports Nicaraguan legislation requiring the creation and maintenance of
committees on prevention, mitigation and response at different territorial levels (municipal,
departmental and regional). It also follows traditional practice of local emergency management headed
by local authorities, hailing from both government and civil society, including adequate representation
of different indigenous groups. Developing a local emergency response capacity entails two steps:
(a) Organization of and Equipment for Local Emergency Committees and Brigades
This activity involves purchase and distribution of emergency response equipment, training
expenses for organizing, and training emergency committees in up to 15 departmental, 2
regional, and 98 municipal committees. Consistent with the responsibilities assigned under
the National System, organization, training and equipping of the committees will be done by
the Civil Defense, through field trips, and information and organizational meetings to
distribute equipment. The project will provide financing to Civil Defense: a) for training
purposes which will cover logistical costs of mobilizing the Civil Defense trainers and b) for
acquiring teaching materials and needed training equipment. After Mitch, the World Bank
supported the organization and equipment of some 45 municipalities at risk from floods and
landslides and therefore, the full 151 municipalities do not require organization and training
35



for emergency committees. A total of 107 municipal committees and 124 emergency
brigades will require training. Training will take into account the local customs and
languages to assure full participation of the indigenous peoples in each community. Each
emergency brigade oversees four specialized brigades, as follows: 1) first aid; 2) search and
rescue; 3) fire prevention; and 4) communications. This activity also includes the purchase
and distribution of equipment to the specialized brigades and training in its use and
maintenance.
(b) Monitoring of the Committees
Follow-up on emergency committee training to assure that the committees remain operative
will include monitoring of equipment maintenance, development of local "Disaster
Response Plans", and preparation and carrying out of simulation exercises. This activity will
be under the responsibility of Civil Defense together with the Municipal Committees and
will cover logistic costs including the provision of eight vehicles to cover mobilization needs
for monitoring the committees.
Sub-component D.2: Promotion of "Preventative Planning"
The objective of this sub-component is to strengthen planning and technical capacity for disaster
mitigation and prevention in at least 25 highly vulnerable municipalities, as per an agreed upon list
ranking Nicaragua's municipalities in order of vulnerability. The list presented in Annex 13 shows
the 110 municipalities identified as most susceptible to disaster risks (superimposing risks from
floods, landslides, volcanoes, seismic and wind events). Disbursement against this component will
be conditional on presentation of a selection criteria for municipalities, based on factors such as
historical records of frequency and impact of disasters, population growth, poverty levels, and access
to services, to permit objective listing of vulnerable municipalities.
(a) Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping
The objective of this activity is to help the eligible municipalities identify their most
prevalent hazards, determine the vulnerability levels of their population, infrastructure and
productive activities, and identify the most feasible structural and non structural mitigation
measures. The main partners in this activity are the local government, community leaders,
NGOs, and local private sector representatives. International and national experts in risk
analysis will be selected to work together with local consultants and NGOs experienced in
community development and land use planning to apply a methodology that will facilitate
validation of scientific knowledge and technical information vis-a-vis local knowledge and
risk perception through primary and secondary data gathering, a series of community
workshops and field visits. The consultant teams will work closely with local officials from
the technical, planning and environmental units of the municipality to ensure transference of
knowledge. Hazard and vulnerability analysis and mapping will be used, through this
methodology, as an opportunity to train local technical officials and to educate community
members. The final outputs by municipality will include a hazard and vulnerability
assessment, including identification of the main factors contributing to vulnerability; GIS-
based hazard and vulnerability maps at a scale of 1:50,000 (municipal level) and 1:5,000
(urban level); and recommendations on feasible structural and non structural mitigation
measures.
36



(b) Long-term Land-Use and Mitigation Planning
Using a process of public consultation, and working together with municipal officials, NGOs
and community leaders, the consultant team which carried out Activity (a) will help the
same municipalities to prepare a long-term development plan (considering a minimum of
twenty years future growth) that identifies areas at risk and indicates appropriate land uses.
The goal of this plan will be to promote sustainable social, economic and environmental
growth in the municipality by including natural hazard risk in future land use planning. The
outputs of this activity by municipality will include a land use and mitigation plan, including
maps at 1:50,000 (municipal level) and 1:5,000 (urban level) identifying risk levels as well
as "safe" growth areas, and recommendations on feasible measures such as zoning
ordinances, alternative uses (for example, parks and sports fields in areas at risk), building
standards, "living" maps etc. to ensure that the recommended land use plans are
implemented. The long-term mitigation plan will incorporate the recommendations on
feasible structural and non structural measures identified under (a).
Project Component E - US$4.16 million
Implementation of Local Vulnerability Reduction Measures
FISE will be responsible for carrying out all activities under this component. FISE will, however, report to
the Territorial Coordinator of the Executive Secretariat who will in turn present progress reports to the
Planning Department which integrate the PMRs for this component. Activities fall into two sub-components,
one to screen mitigation measures to qualify for sub-projects and to prepare municipal investment plans, and
one to actually implement the sub-projects.
Sub-component E.1: Selection of Sub Projects and Preparation of Municipal Investment Plan
Under this sub-component, FISE will review recommended mitigation measures emerging from the
vulnerability analyses and "preventative planning exercises" (see component D.2) as per its normal
project evaluation cycle and will select eligible sub-projects, subject to the following criteria: 1)
Subprojects must not appear on the "negative list" shown below; 2) The total amount of any single
sub-project does not exceed equivalent of US$100,000 and the total number of sub-projects for any
one municipality may not exceed an amount to be specified in the Operations Manual, times the
number of inhabitants; 3) Municipalities must have presented acceptable land use development
plans, which include programs to check development or settlement of land identified as at risk; 4)
Subprojects must apply standard FISE designs at pre-established costs and pass standard
environmental screening procedures, unless the Guidelines for Selection and Evaluation of
Mitigation Measures call for additional procedures. Disbursement for this sub-component will be
conditional on FISE's presentation of designs, costs and environmental screening procedures
acceptable to the Association for standard sub-projects (listed as type "I" in the attached chart) and
of procedures or terms of reference acceptable to the Association for non-standard sub-projects
(listed as "2"or "3" in the attached chart).
Priority mitigation measures identified as feasible financially would be integrated into an investment
program to be included in the Municipal Investment Plan. To accomplish this objective, FISE would
follow its participatory planning methodology, which promotes leadership on the part of the
municipal government, and close partnerships between the local government and central agencies
and ministries, and civil society.
Financing for Implementation of sub-projects (component E.2) will be conditional on FISE's
presenting the following formulae found acceptable by the Association:
37



1. For evaluating project costs: Pre-established costs for standard items as noted in guidelines,
Maximum cost per person protected, or formula for costlbenefit analysis based on insurance or
reconstruction costs
2. For evaluating environmental impact: Terms of Reference for an independent environmental
impact assessment
3. For evaluating technical design: Codes to be applied in cases of construction in areas at risk of
flood, landslide, wind and seismic events and Terms of Reference for special review by experts in
disaster resistant construction
Negative list
The project will not finance any subproject which will be classified as category A under the
Bank's EA policy, or subprojects which are implemented in violation of Nicaragua's
environmental laws and environmental impact assessment procedures, or Nicaragua's laws
on treatment of cultural heritage. Nor will any physical or economic involuntary
displacement (as interpreted in accordance with the Association's Operational Directive
(OD) 4.30) take place as a consequence of the execution of the Subprojects; specifically, no
person shall have - as a consequence of the execution of the Subprojects - his or her: (i)
right, title or interest in any house or any other fixed or movable goods acquired or
possessed, temporarily or permanently; or (ii) business, occupation, work or place of
residence or habitat adversely affected;
Specifically, subprojects involving the following activities will be excluded from financing:
Dam construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation or strengthening.
Activities affecting natural protected areas recognized by central, departmental, regional or
municipal governments (or buffer zones thereof), other than to rehabilitate areas damaged by
a previous natural disaster.
Land reclamation (i.e., drainage of wetlands or filling of water bodies to create land).
Land clearance and leveling (when affecting natural habitats and natural land contours,
natural habitats for this purpose being those water or land areas where most of the original
plant and animal species are still present), except for clearing of debris resulting from an
emergency. (For more details on natural habitats, Bank Operational Policy (OP) 4.04 can be
consulted at www.worldbank.org).

countries other than Nicaragua, in such a manner as to in any way adversely change the
quality or quantity of water flowing to or bordering said countries; and (b) activities
involving the installation or construction of facilities which, when operated after their
construction or installation, will affect, or involve the use of, water of rivers or of other
bodies of water (or their tributaries) which flow through or are bordered by countries other
than Nicaragua, in such a manner as to in any way adversely change the quality or quantity
of water flowing to or bordering said countries (unless such bordering countries have
formally expressed in writing to the Bank and to the Guarantor their no-objection to the
activities referred to in (a) or (b) herein).

NICARAGUA: Natural Disaster Vulnerability Reduction
4.1. The Context
Nicaragua's history repeatedly attests to the high cost of natural disasters, and to the fact that losses
and impacts are heightened by lack of investments in preparedness and mitigation. In the last five
years Nicaragua has been hit by hurricanes Joan and Mitch (classified as catastrophic events), by a
volcano eruption, and several major forest fires. Chart 4-1 presents some of the economic effects of
these recent natural disasters plus the infamous 1972 Managua earthquake.

Summary of Benefits and Costs:
4.2 The Economic Cost of Disasters
The economic costs of natural disasters' impacts can be classified in a) direct costs, mostly in terms of
lives, property and income losses; and b) indirect costs, mostly in terms of reduced economic prospects,
increases in poverty, social disruptions, etc. A study commissioned as part of this project helps estimate
part of these costs to Nicaragua: Freeman P. et al (2000) "Case Study of Natural Catastrophe Risk in
Nicaragua" IIASA, Vienna, (available in the project's file). Among direct costs the study only considered
property losses to storms, flood and earthquake. Among indirect costs the study focus on the impact of the
same set of natural disasters upon GDP growth and poverty prospects. Its main findings were:
* Direct costs: taking into account the probability of occurrence, Nicaragua annual average loss of capital
due to major storms, floods and earthquakes is approximately $20 million or 0.4% of the country's
capital stock (in the year 2000). Absent investment in disaster management this $20 million figure would
grow at the same pace as the capital stock (1% to 3% annually). Again, this figure does not include the
economic costs of deaths and casualties that are particularly high in Nicaragua (see above Chart 4-2).
* Indirect costs: to consider dynamic impacts, the likelihood of natural disasters was incorporated into the
Bank's Revised Minimum Standard Model (RMSM, the modeling tool used by the Bank to develop its
Country Assistance Strategies). Three post-disaster hypothesis were used: a) that Nicaragua has access to
external additional financing so that it can immediately reconstruct all its lost and damaged properties; b)
that external additional financing only add to 50% of the reconstruction needs; and c) that no additional
external financing is available. As could be expected, if external funding for post-disaster reconstruction
is plenty and ready available, long term impacts can be contained. Otherwise the disaster impacts could
be long lasting. Taking 1998 as the baseline, the Bank's RMSM model for Nicaragua predicts that ten
years without annual additions of external funding for disaster reconstruction would: a) cut the GDP
growth rate by half, from more than 6% to less than 3%; b) increase the number of people in poverty by
almost 25%, from 1.8 to 2.2 million; c) increase the number of people in extreme poverty by more than
45%, from 0.4 to 0.6 million.
4.3. Investing in Preparedness and Mitigation
The magnitude of the damages associated with natural disasters call for preparedness and mitigation efforts,
and while no agreed methodology exists to assess the overall returns of these type of investments, there are
many partial evidences to the effect tat the returns exist and are high.
Pollner (2000) "Managing Catastrophic Risks Using Alternative Risk Financing and Insurance Pool
Mechanisms" cites estimates from civil engineering experts to the effect that, on average, an increased
investment in vulnerability reduction measures of 1% of a structure's costs will reduce the "probable
maximum loss" from wind damage by at least one third. Detailed data suggests that retrofitting residential
buildings at costs running from 1.8% to 3.4% of total building value, will reduce "probable maximum loss"
by 50%. For commercial buildings the same impact is expected from investments of 2.0% - 3.8% in
structural retrofitting.
In the U.S., FEMA has done extensive work to demonstrate the benefits of the use of building codes and has
developed a computer program (Hazards U.S. or "HAZUS") which is used as a decision-support tool to
calculate returns on investments in building construction to lower probable maximum loss from earthquakes.
In a study commissioned as part of this project preparation, Professor Harold Cochran of the University of
Colorado at Boulder considered Hurricane Mitch's impact in terms of property damage, lives lost and
casualties, and examined scenarios with and without mitigation measures (timely warnings, channel
improvements and land use restrictions.) The study focused on flood damages and identified ranges of high
45



medium and low damage for different areas of the country based in environmental vulnerability, population
at risk, and the feasibility of mitigation measures. Cochran's conclusions identified hazard mapping and land
use restrictions as the initiatives that render the highest benefits in terms of disaster mitigation.
Main Assumptions:
4.4. Costs Avoided Versus Investing in Preparedness and Mitigation. Rates of Return and Net Present
Values
With respect to the question: How much should Nicaragua invest in disaster management, the above
discussion leads to the following conclusion. Given the figure for property losses due to natural
disasters: $20 million per year (from section 4.2 above), only one of several measures of the costs of
natural disasters, and setting a relatively conservative target for investments in disaster management -
to cut these losses by half - the following figures show required investments for the ten years horizon.
Chart 4-3
Investing in Disaster Management to Avoid 10 Million Dollars of Annual Property Losses
8%                                  9.4                          4.0
10%                                  9.1                         5.5
15%                                  8.7                         6.5
20%                                  8.3                         7.1
25%                                  8.0                         7.2
This is simply an illustrative exercise based on two major assumptions: a) a very modest project target,
reducing property losses due to major natural disasters by half. (In fact, international experience suggests
that reducing death and casualties is both more important and more easily achievable); b) a very ambitious
effectiveness goal, that the investment in disaster management actually attain the proposed target Actually
the last assumption is part of any project proposal, but risks of not achieving the expected effectiveness grow
with the complexity of the project.
Comparatively, the present project is a) much smaller in its investment; but, b) has wider aims,
encompassing investments in emergency preparedness, and mitigation measures (structural and non-
structural) to reduce loss of property and life immediately after natural disaster events strike. Therefore it is
safe to say that it its expected rate of returns in the higher range of chart 4-3, considering that:
*  Because this is one of the country's first initiatives in disaster management it would address the
protection measures that have the larger payoff. For instance following the findings of Cochran's study,
the project investments are focused on preventative planning and avoiding growth in areas at risk,
including flood prone areas, areas susceptible to landslide, and to volcanic, seismic and wind events.
This measures can render an IRR of 25% or more.
*  Furthermore, where amenable, the project will perform cost benefit analysis of sub-components, like in
the case of protective investments for specific buildings and other investment proposals in mitigation
measures (with the exception of the pre-established investments under Component E
*  Finally considering the disaster related indirect costs (see above section 4.2) this project has the potential
to reduce by 1/4 Nicaragua's annual need of external financing for post-disaster reconstruction, and to cut
by half the risk of setbacks in GDP growth and poverty alleviation that natural disasters entail.

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
NICARAGUA: Natural Disaster Vulnerability Reduction
Procurement
Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with World Bank "Guidelines:
Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits", published in January 1995 (revised January/August
1996, September 1997 and January 1999); and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by
World Bank Borrowers" published in January 1997 (revised in September 1999 and January 1999), and the
provisions stipulated in the Credit Agreement.
Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement Procurement
Procurement for the Project would be carried out by the Executive Secretariat for Disaster Prevention,
Mitigation and Response (the Secretariat) which is lodged within the Office of the Vice-Presidency. The
Secretariat will be responsible for the project including procurement and financial management, with the
assistance of two agencies: For activities in Components I through 4, UCRESEP - which presently performs
these same activities for other ongoing Bank operations and for Component 5, the Emergency Social
Investment Fund (Fondo de Inversion Social para Emergencia, FISE) for all activities relating to
implementation of local mitigation measures under the project and which will directly implement
Component 5, i.e., procure goods, works and services. UCRESEP would be in charge of consolidating the
information on the part of FISE in order to ensure that project information for purposes of evaluation
financial, procurement and disbursement in the project, and for auditing activities.
A procurement assessment of UCRESEP was done under the Competitiveness LIL Project and filed as
required in LCOPR. The results of this assessment indicated an average to high risk in the Competitiveness
project because UCRESEP has expanded its support activities to several Bank projects but its installed
capacity is at its limits. The action plan for this project will include provisions to hire additional
procurement and accounting staff in UCRESEP. Notwithstanding, the action plan, closely coordinated with
all parties involved in the use of the services of UCRESEP on the part of the Bank, should include a
condition to update of the assessment of UCRESEP vis a vis its support commitments with all Bank projects
to ensure that its installed capacity is sufficient to serve the needs of all projects in time and quality, as
required in their implementation plans. The update to the assessment should be conducted no later than 3
months into project effectiveness. On the basis of this background, and while the update is completed, the
risk assessment for this project should be registered in the high mark. Also, it is noted that arrangements for
procurement supervision on the part of the Bank should be strategically planned to designate, if at all
possible, only one PAS to provide procurement support to all projects in UCRESEP's portfolio. Indeed, this
should provide grounds for a uniform and consistent approach to procurement notices and to monitor the
work plan of UCRESEP in the different projects.
UCRESEP was originally established as an entity of the GON under the direction of the Vice President's
Office. Its terms of reference encompassed the technical supervision of the GON's projects within the scope
of the public sector reform, with some activities in financial and procurement, basically at the level of
coordination. In recent years, UCRESEP has moved more into a role of administrative, financial and
procurement support to new projects in the sphere of public sector and policy reform. As of November
2000, UCRESEP administers approximately US$60 million of financing proceeds from IDA and other
financiers. In addition, the recent agreement to involve it in the Competitiveness LIL, its administration
responsibilities were increased to US$65 million. UCRESEP has a core team composed of Project
Coordinator, two procurement officers, and financial-administrative officer, are all knowledgeable of IDA
operations and financial and procurement policies and procedures. UCRESEP assumes directly the
responsibility of all procurement activities and direct management of funds under the recently approved
48



Competitiveness LIL and the Economic Management Technical Assistance Project, including management
of Special Accounts.
In view of UCRESEP's participation in project administration of this project, it is proposed that, except for
the technical inputs required in the request and evaluation of proposals, the Executive Secretariat will not be
engaged in any procurement activity. Notwithstanding, its technical staff will be responsible for the quality
of technical documents and products delivered by consultants, or physical inputs financed under the project,
as a result of any contracting done by UCRESEP on its behalf.
A procurement manual or a chapter of the Project Operational Manual focusing on procurement should be
prepared and adopted prior to effectiveness. The manual should describe, as a minimum:
Staffing of the procurement unit.
Organization of the procurement function including a detailed description of individual
responsibilities and appropriate internal control procedures.
Thresholds for different types of procurement of goods and works and for selection of consultants
Thresholds for prior review.
Procedural details of the various procurement methods which are going to be used for the Project.
Procedures for planning and monitoring/supervising procurement actions.
Reporting requirements (internally and to IDA).
The Project's filing system and procedures to ensure its control, security and confidentiality.
In addition, the agencies would prepare standard formats for shopping.
A consultant is preparing a system for filing, monitoring and reporting procurement actions. However it
will not be ready on time for negotiations. Consequently the UCRESEP, as Financial Management Unit for
the Executive Secretariat is INELIGIBLE for PM-based disbursements on procurement reporting grounds.
Such situation will be re-assessed when the consultant work is completed.
Procurement Plan. At appraisal, the Borrower developed a procurement plan for project implementation
which provided the basis for the aggregate amounts for the procurement methods (per Table A). This plan
was approved by the RPA and is in the project files. At the beginning of each calendar year, the Borrower
will update the Procurement Plan with a detailed procurement schedule for the coming year.
Frequency of Procurement Supervision. Procurement supervision missions should be carried out every
year by a Procurement Specialist (PS) or Procurement Accredited Staff (PAS) and include a review of: (i)
the PCU capacity; (ii) the procurement plan for the project, including a timetable for procurement actions
anticipated during the next 12 months; (iii) the PCU monitoring system for the purposes of the Project; and
(iv) complete records for one in every five contracts (for goods, works, and consulting services,
respectively). The PS or PAS should perform selected physical inspections of the goods received and meet
with selected suppliers/contractors, whenever possible.

Financial Management Responsibility
UCRESEP will be responsible for the implementation and maintenance of a financial management system,
in order to efficiently manage the Project's funds and timely prepare the Project Management Reports
(PMR). The financial management system will include policies, norms and procedures for Planning,
Budget, Procurement, Accounting, Reporting, and Auditing, to ensure the provision of accurate and timely
information to the Executive Secretariat and to the Word Bank, regarding Project funds resources and
expenditures, as required by OP/10.02. The system will provide information on physical performance,
according to Project's out-put and indicators included in Annex 1.
FISE will execute Component 5 and will be responsible for implementing and maintaining the financial
management system designed by UCRESEP in order to provide uniform, accurate and timely information to
UCRESEP regarding Project finds resources and expenditure, procurement and monitoring.
The Project financial management system must be in place within six month period, after Project
effectiveness. A Bank Financial Management Specialist will carry out a financial management review, in
order to assess the system accuracy.

Disbursement Procedures
Until a PMR compliant financial management system is in place UCRESEP will follow traditional
disbursement procedures for withdrawal of funds under the credit agreement in accordance with the
guidelines set in the Disbursement Procedures Handbook. SOEs documentation will be maintained by
UCRESEP for post-review and audit purposes. Reimbursement requests should be sent to the IDA on a
monthly basis. Once the accounting and financial management system is deemed compliant with LACI
requirements, and is certified as such by the Association, a migration to a LACI type of disbursements
may be implemented as described hereafter.
To facilitate project implementation, credit proceeds would be deposited in a Special Account to be
opened in US Dollars at a commercial bank acceptable to IDA.
Each application for disbursement shall be supported by a PMR or SOE. Upon receipt of each application,
IDA would deposit into the Special Account an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) the amount so requested;
and (b) the amount which IDA has determined, based on the PMR, is required to be deposited in order to
finance eligible expenditures during the six-months period following the date of the PMR; provided,
however, that the amount so deposited, when added to the amount indicated by said PMR to be remaining in
the Special Account, shall not exceed an amount equal to US$3.5 million.
The Special Account is only to be used for eligible expenditures under the credit (under no circumstances
may funds in the Special Account be used to cover the share of expenditures corresponding to the
counterpart and/or other financiers). Transfers from the Special Account to other bank accounts will only be
performed to meet eligible expenditures for a limited period of less than 30 days
Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):
The IDA and the Borrower have agreed that if by Project effectiveness, UCRESEP has not fully
implemented a financial management system to produce the PMR required by IDA, the traditional
disbursements procedures will apply for the first two quarters of Project implementation. IDA funds will be
disbursed to a Special Account at the Central Bank, according to the categories and percentages shown in
the attached charts.
The Association may require withdrawals from the Credit Account to be made on the basis of statements cf
expenditure for: (a) goods and works costing less than $150,000 equivalent per contract; (b) consulting
services provided by firms costing less than $100,000 equivalent per contract; (c) consulting services
provided by individuals costing less than $50,000 equivalent per contract; (d) Subproject expenses; (e)
training expenditures; and (f) expenditures for incremental operating costs under such terms and conditions
as the Association shall specify by notice to the Borrower.
Project funds can be used to reimburse expenses made after November 30, 2000 and prior to signing, for
consultancies, training and goods under the project up to a total of $500,000 (SDR 390,000).
Use of Project Management Reports (PMRs)
The PMRs will serve as disbursement requests. Transition to PMRs will be subject to the satisfactory
results of new financial management and procurement assessments. Once UCRESEP becomes PMR
compliant, disbursements would be in accordance with guidelines set in the Loan Administration Change
Initiative (LACI) Implementation Handbook. Each application for withdrawal should separately identify
the funds requested from the credit account, and would be supported by a PMR or such other documents
54



and evidence as the Association may request. PMRs should be submitted within 45 days from the
preceding quarter. Upon receipt of each application for withdrawal, the Association, on behalf of the
Borrower, shall withdraw from the credit account and deposit into the Special Account an amount equal
to the lesser: (a) the amount requested; and (b) the amount the Association has determined, based on the
PMR accompanying the application, is required to be deposited in order to finance eligible expenditures
during the six month period following the date of the report, but in no case should exceed 20% of the
total loan funds, without prior authorization from the Loan Department.

Auditing Arrangements
An external auditor, acceptable to IDA, will be contracted by the Executive Secretariat to carry out the
annual review of the Project financial reports, as required by OP/BP 10.02. The auditor will be selected
according with the Bank's Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of consultants by the World Bank
Borrowers dated January 1997, revised in September 1997, so that the audit can be performed throughout
each year of Project implementation.
The Project financial statements, Special Account Statement, SOEs (if applicable) and the PMRs will be
review and audit report will be submitted to IDA within 120 days of the close of the year ending in
December 31. The Guidelines and Terms of Reference for Audits of Projects with Financing by the World
Bank in Latin American and the Caribbean Region should be followed when preparing the terms of
reference (TORs) for the audit and these guidelines should be provided to the selected auditors.

Summarv History of Natural Disasters in Nicaragua
Devastating natural disasters have repeatedly highlighted Nicaragua's need for effective disaster management.
Although over the past 25 years the national government has increasingly assumed operational and
organizational responsibilities in this respect, the main focus has been disaster response and relief. Moreover,
there has been little coordination and sustainability of programs due to the lack of a comprehensive disaster
management system. A historical breakthrough has recently taken place, however, with the creation of a
National System for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation and Response, through Law No. 337 (officially published
on April 7, 2000). The law's ratification has, for the first time, placed coordination of disaster management
with a civilian organization, the Executive Secretariat, while also giving a major emphasis to prevention and
mitigation.
A Chronology of Natural Disasters in Nicaragua
Geographic location combines with weather, temperature, pressure and geological conditions to make
Nicaragua one of the world's most disaster-prone countries. According to the Office of the Vice Presidency,
major catastrophic events since 1970 have accounted for 10,529 deaths, 200,858 disappearances, and more
than US$4 billion in losses. (Dictamen de creacion del Sistema Nacionalpara la Prevenci6n, Mitigaci6n y
Atencion a Desastres, pp. 4, Oct. 11, 1999)
A series of natural disasters in the twentieth century, at the rate of one major disaster every two years, severely
affected Nicaragua. In 1926 Nicaragua suffered a strong earthquake, destroying 80 percent of the buildings in
Le6n, and damaging 50 percent of housing stock in Managua. Likewise, in 1931, an earthquake measuring 5.9
on the Richter scale left at least 1,000 people dead and 2,000 injured. On December 23, 1972 three more majo-
earthquakes occurred in the Managua metropolitan area, all measuring above 5.0 on the Richter scale. The
earthquakes resulted in 10,000 deaths and 20,000 injuries. Managua required extensive rebuilding and
replacement of critical infrastructure.
In May 1982, Hurricane Alleta destroyed 60 percent of the country's corn crop, and disabled 90 percent of
cotton production resulting in US$480 million of economic losses. In 1988, Hurricane Joan destroyed
Bluefields Island, Rama Island, and Corn Island. The economic loss amounted to US$840 million.
In 1992, the Cerro Negro volcano erupted, throwing thousands of cubic meters of volcanic sand and ash over
several thousand farming fields. The ash devastated more than 500 houses and caused more than US$19
million in damages.
An earthquake reaching 7.2 on the Richter scale at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean in the same year caused
waves of 8 to 15 meters. The Tsunamis affected approximately 250 Km of coastal inland along the pacific
coast resulting in an economic loss of US$25 million.
September 1993 brought Tropical Storm Bret, which caused major infrastructure damage. The storm affected
more than 65,000 people and incurred more than US$5 million in damages.
In 1995, intense rainfall beginning on September 24 and ending on October 11 affected 1,300 people. Floods
and mudslides caused US$17 million in damages, of which US$11 million corresponded to the agriculture
sector.
Hurricane Cesar's heavy rainfall in 1996 effected more that 6,000 people damaging the Inter-American
highway, local roads, and Leon neighborhoods. The following year a prolonged drought resulted in substantial
agricultural losses in Leon, Chinandega and Madriz. Estimated economic loss totaled US$93 million.
64



Hurricane Mitch struck on October 1998 as the country began to emerge from a lingering economic depression
extending back to the civil war. Hurricane Mitch caused almost 3,000 deaths and significantly affected more
than 368,000 people. The hurricane also destroyed a significant portion of the national transportation
infrastructure including 1,363 Km of non-paved roads and 1,125 Km of paved roads.
Infrastructure losses, future revenue loss, and physical damage impacted all sectors of the economy. The
agricultural market, particularly the coffee sector, lost 80 percent of production. The hurricane destroyed 325
education centers and 23 bridges. Electric systems and telecommunications incurred serious damages;
however, authorities rapidly restored basic services. The economic loss amounted to US$3.8 billion. The
extent of damage and the difficulty in responding more rapidly to the devastation of Hurricane Mitch
influenced the government's decision in establishing the National System.

Additional Annex 12
Institutional History of Disaster Management in Nicaragua
The institutional history of disaster management in Nicaragua dates back to the enactment of the 1976 Civil
Defense Law, passed in the aftermath of the 1972 Managua earthquake. According to the Law, the High
Command of National Civil Defense would be the permanent institution for disaster response, through
National Committees for Emergencies (usually established during an emergency). Ever since, the Civil
Defense has carried out disaster response activities with cooperation from the Army, Police Forces,
community members, and the Red Cross. Government rehabilitation and assistance have usually followed
the immediate response actions, coordinated individually by the administering agencies. Moreover, the Civil
Defense has directed significant efforts at creating municipal and local committees for disaster response.
During the 1980s, the National Emergency Committees continued to serve as the principal coordination
agency in disaster response. The government, however, redefined the Committee to include representatives
of all government agencies and encouraged the participation of state and local entities. The efforts led by
Civil Defense during these years increasingly demonstrated the value of organizing communities to improve
local disaster response.
In the 1 990s, under the auspices of the United Nations International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction
(IDNDR), the government formed a National Committee integrated by representatives of the public and the
private sector to promote prevention and mitigation activities. The Committee, led by Civil Defense, was the
country's first permanent body with an expanded role beyond immediate disaster response. The principal
government agencies included INETER, the Ministry of Foreign Relations, MARENA, the Ministry of
Health, and MAGFOR. In accordance with IDNDR objectives, the Committee was charged with assessing
prevalent hazards and naticnal vulnerability levels, identifying prevention and mitigation actions,
establishing a legal framework for disaster management, and promoting disaster awareness. Several studies
were carried out, and some pilot initiatives implemented, but the impact of these efforts was not as
widespread as expected. However, recent efforts to create the National System have built on the lessons
learned under IDNDR.
In 1995 the Government of Nicaragua joined CEPREDENAC, which was created as a coordinating center
for disaster prevention in Central America. As a result, a National Commission of CEPREDENAC was
established to define and coordinate a national strategy for disaster management, including prevention and
mitigation.
Despite previous government efforts, the extent of Hurricane Mitch damage in October of 1998 revealed the
lack of both local response capacity and of coordination to manage a more integrated national response. In
the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch, the Vice Presidency, through the National Emergency Committee,
established a civilian task force to coordinate the response of government agencies. The task force's
experience along with the government's previous experience provided important lessons. The Committee, in
particular, indicated the urgent needs for vulnerability reduction programs, and for strengthening the
infrastructure for large-scale response. The Mitch experience also revealed to the Committee that inter-
agency coordination was inadequate, making it difficult to allocate resources or to promote relief and
rehabilitation programs and activities at a national scale. The Vice President's Report of November 24, 1998
indicated many of the same lessons, recommending the establishment of a National Disaster Management
System and a renewed emphasis on prevention and mitigation.
In June 1999, the government organized a campaign named "Building a Culture of Prevention" in Managua.
During this campaign, representatives of civil society confirmed their agreement on the need to establish a
national disaster management system, and on the need for all sectors of society to start taking effective
actions to reduce vulnerability. The campaign resulted in a series of recommendations including the
66



promotion of public/private sector participation in disaster management, risk and vulnerability assessment,
regional cooperation, and of disaster awareness.
The National System for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation and Response
The momentum created by Mitch facilitated the legislative process that culminated in the passage of Law
No. 337, which created the National System, and defined the role for its coordinating entity, the Executive
Secretariat. A proposal to create a National Prevention System had been introduced in 1995 into the
National Assembly, but it was not evaluated by the latter's Commission of Defense and Government until
December 1998. Almost a year later, on October 1999, and after several revisions, the proposal was looked
over jointly by the same Commission and the Committee on Central American Integration. A consultation
process was simultaneously carried out, which included seminars in Honduras (February 1999) and
Dominican Republic (May 1999). Moreover, in June 1999, and with support from UNDP, formulation of a
National Risk Reduction Program was initiated. The National Assembly approved Law 337 on 8 March
2000, which went into effect on April 7, when it was published in La Gaceta, Diario Oficial.
Since the passage of Law 337, Nicaragua's legislature has continued to develop the related legislative
mandates (laws and decrees) to clearly articulate the government's support for disaster management, and the
roles and responsibilities of the different members of the National System. This Project has been seen as an
opportune means of highlighting the importance the National System, as confirmed by a letter from the
Nicaraguan Minister of Finance, Estaban Duque Estrada, to the World Bank (see letter at end of annex). The
following table summarizes the current status of the laws and regulations that guide the System and
Executive Secretariat.
ENABLING LEGISLATION
LAW/DECREE OBJECTIVE STATUS
Law 337: National for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation, and Response System. Establish the necessary norms,
dispositions, and general instruments to create, and allow the functioning of, an inter-institutional system
focused on reducing the impact of natural or induced disasters through prevention, mitigation, and response
activities. Became effective on 7 April 2000
Decree 53/2000: Establish the regulatory framework needed to apply and execute Law 337. Became effective
on 28 June 2000
Decree 98/2000: Assigns responsibilities to participating entities of the National System. Became effective on
5 October 2000
To be determined: Creation and Implementation of the National Disaster Fund FND). Being prepared by
Executive Secretariat
The National System does not include new agencies (excepting the Executive Secretariat). As designed, the
System actually integrates (i) government agencies and ministries horizontally to facilitate intersectoral
coordination and consolidation of disaster management efforts at the national level, and (ii) regional and
local government and civil society groups vertically to facilitate territorial coordination and promotion of
"4coordinated decentralization" based on improved local capacities and private sector participation. The
Executive Secretariat, as the coordination body, is thus supposed to lie in the intersection of the horizontal
and vertical integration promoted by the System. As such, Article 4 of the Law establishes the "National
System" as "an organic and linked group ofstructures, operational relations, methods and procedures
amongst different Ministries and Public Sector Institutions, and between the different social and private
sectors, and departmental, regional and municipal authorities. "
Specifically, the system is comprised by the following: (a) The National Committee, which is a political
body headed by the President of the Republic, and integrated by representatives of several ministries and
agencies; (b) the Executive Secretariat, which is the System's coordinating entity; (c) Relevant government,
semi-autonomous agencies, ministries, private sector firms, and NGOs, some of which participate also
67



through work commissions on key issues (i.e., education, natural hazards, infrastructure, etc.) or as link
entities; and (d) regional and municipal committees, which ensure territorial coordination at their respective
levels. The central core to make the System operational in the near future is integrated by the National
Committee, the Executive Secretariat, Civil Defense and INETER. Other key System's members include,
inter alia, MAGFOR, MARENA, INIFOM, Ministry of Education and the municipal governments.
The Executive Secretariat
Law No. 337 places the Secretariat within the office of the Vice Presidency as an independent agency. The
Secretariat's general role includes intersectoral coordination (horizontally across government ministries and
agencies) and territorial coordination (vertically through the Departmental, Regional and Municipal
Committees). In this respect, the Secretariat is expected to integrate and promote disaster management
policies, programs and activities, and facilitate the improvement of disaster management capacity at all
levels. Moreover, the Secretariat should serve in an advisory capacity to the National Committee,
developing, implementing, and updating in the future the National Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Plan
and the Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan. Finally, once established, the Secretariat will manage,
in coordination with the National Committee, the National Disaster Fund required under Law 337.
The full scope and responsibility of the Executive Secretariat are described in Article 10. The article outlines
the Secretariat's 11 specific functions and defines its organizational structure (See Attachment at the end of
this Annex for specific details).
Several disasters, including the floods of September 1999 and the eruption of volcano San Cristobal of April
2000, occurred during the legislative development of Law No. 337. The Civil Defense continued to
coordinate the disaster response with limited cross-governmental support. Shortly after the enactment of the
law and the establishment of the Secretariat, the earthquake at Messiah (July 6, 2000) and Hurricane Keith
(September 2000) struck Nicaragua without warning. Both events initiated the Executive Secretariat's role
as the central coordinating body of the National System, initiating also functional working relationships with
the territorial participants.
During the period of legislative review, the Executive Secretariat commenced internal work on staffing for
key positions. The Secretariat has also taken a lead in developing and promoting the establishment of an
Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to serve as the centralized location and command post for integrating
and coordinating the activities of the System's members during national emergencies. The Secretariat has
been cooperating closely with the US Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) for technical
support and assistance in developing the EOC infrastructure and operational capabilities.
The Executive Secretariat is currently in the process of attracting external financing for institutional
development. The Secretariat currently operates with support from the Office of the Vice Presidency,
UNDP, and staff on administrative loan from cooperating agencies (e.g., Ministry of Economy). The present
staffing includes the Executive Secretary, ten professionals, six support staff focused on territorial issues,
technical advisors, legal advisors, administrative management, and financial management. The institutional
development plan for the Executive Secretariat anticipates an expansion of its functional capabilities to
include public and external Relations. A fully functional planning capability including management of the
National Disaster Fund is also expected. Overall, the Secretariat requires a final organizational configuration
integrated by the Executive Secretary, 16 professionals, and six support staff.
Recurrent operating costs to support the Secretariat's institutional and operational role over a three year
period are estimated at USD$1,677,000. The estimate includes salaries of core personnel and expected
operating expenses such as services, materials and additional training. The following table shows a
breakdown of categories and recurrent costs.

Additional Annex 13
Comparative Vulnerability Among Nicaraguan Municipalities
The following chart lists the I 10 most vulnerable municipalities in Nicaragua, as determined by a study
conducted by the Spanish consultancy firm PYCSA. The study took into consideration landslide vulnerability,
volcanoes, earthquakes, floods and access to lifeline infrastructure, as well as population growth and poverty. A
series of overlays were then developed to determine which municipalities were most vulnerable to
environmental disasters. Five of these maps, ranking municipalities by flood risk, landslide risk, volcanic risk,
seismic risk and accessibility to hospitals, are presented in the map section at the end of this document.

Gender and Disaster
A recent World Bank study indicated that including gender in disaster projects holds the promise of substantial
benefits at minimum cost. The study, entitled Gender and Post-Disaster Reconstruction: The Case of Hurricane
Mitch in Honduras and Nicaragua, showed that gendered perspective in disaster mitigation is significant because
(i) men and women have different vulnerabilities to disasters, (ii) men and women tend to have different risk
perceptions and (iii) men and women tend to cope differently in the aftermath of a natural disaster.
Vulnerabilities to disaster Biological factors, such as pregnancy and lactation, can increase women's
vulnerability to the negative impacts of disaster. Additionally, different social roles for men and women result in
different vulnerabilities between the sexes. Men face an increased risk of morbidity and mortality due to their
social role as protector and defender of the household. They are more likely to participate in search and rescue
operations than women are, and are less likely to evacuate to shelters in the short term. For women, their social
vulnerabilities to disaster can relate to their inferior position in the social structure, including lack of access to
transportation and communication. Such vulnerabilities can prevent women from learning about evacuation
warnings and utilizing shelter options. Single headed households can be more vulnerable to the negative
impacts of disaster since the single parent tends to be less mobile, given their role as caregiver. Besides, the
single parent has to combine caregiving and meeting the economic needs of the household. The Hurricane Mitch
experience showed that the amount of female headed households tends to increased considerably immediately
after a disaster.
Risk perceptions Men and women have a differential perception of risk. Women seem to have a lower
threshold of risk tolerance than men do. Consequently, women are quicker to heed disaster warnings and
evacuation alerts than their male counterparts. They are also more likely to perceive the probability of disaster
resurgence.
Coping strategies with disasters Men and women tend to cope differently during and after a disaster. Women
tend to cope by mobilizing formal and informal social networks in order to meet the needs of family, children
and the larger community. Women are more likely to evacuate to shelters in the short term than men. Men, on
the other hand, often seem to rely upon strategies that take them away from their families and communities.
These include: seeking external employment, temporary or permanent migration, and, sometimes, abandoning
the family.
A gendered perspective in disaster mitigation would include: (i) ensuring that training needs for disaster
preparedness for both men and women are met, (ii) ensuring communication strategy includes mechanisms to
reach both women and men and, (iii) ensuring participation of both men and women in the development of
disaster awareness curricula and campaigns, risk mapping and analysis, emergency response preparation and
local disaster mitigation plans. Participation of both men and women in the participatory assessments would
stimulate effective cooperation of men and women in the disaster emergency phase and would assure the
inclusion of different needs and priorities of men and women, resulting in a more efficient coping strategy for
disaster prevention and mitigation. Under the Programa de Apoyo de Administracion Rural (PAAR) project, for
example, community-based disaster prevention in forests in Honduras utilized a participatory assessment with
the whole household and specifically integrated men, women and children. The communities that had these
mechanisms in place prior to Mitch have responded more quickly and more cohesively to the post-disaster
challenges.
