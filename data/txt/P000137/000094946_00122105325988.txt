SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Agricultural Background
Ecological Regions
1.        Botswana has three major ecological regions:  (a)  The Eastern Zone
(Hardvelt), coincides with the tropical ferruginous soils and the higher
rainfall areas of the country; it ranges in width from about 50 km to 300 km
running along the entire eastern border of the country. Natural vegetation
consists of deciduous forest in the north, mixed mopane bushvelt in the center
and mixed acaci/combretum tree savannah in the south. It is the most fertile
and least arid of Botswana's three ecological regions and, by consequence, the
most diensely populated and intensively farmed. More than 80% of the country's
inhabitaalts live here mainly in villages sited around communal wells or bore-
holes; (b)  The Okavango Swamp, located in the north central area, west of   2
the Plakarikari Salt pan. Water flows into the northern end of the 15,000 km
swamp, through several rivers originatinig in Zambia and Angola and flows out
at the southern end into the Kalahari Desert through the Ngobe and Botletle
rivers. In between, a maze of waterways meanders through grass savannah and
aquatic grasslands. The region is infested with malaria and trypanosomiasis
and is better suited to wildlife and tourism than agriculture at present.
Agricultural activity is confined to the fringes of the swamp and consists
of subsistence cropping on receding flood plains and grazing in areas where
tsetse fly has been controlled. (c) The Kalahari Desert (Sandvelt) includes
all of Botswana south of the Okavango Swamp and west of the Hardvelt. Nat-
ural vegetation is largely determined by rainfall and consists of arid shrub
savannah in the very dry south western corner of the country (less than 250
mm annually), Kalahari bush savannah in the southern and central parts (250-
350 mm) and Kalahari tree and bush savannah in the northern and eastern
parts (350 - 500 mm). All three types of vegetation provide acceptable
grazing for livestock, and the region as a whole is suitable only for live-
stock production. There are few permanent year-round sources of surface
water, rainfall is too low, soils are loo porous and evaporation rates too
high for bodies of water to accumulai- ,is the surface; wildlife migrate out
to the fringes of the desert during the dry winters.
Soils
2.        There are four major soil types of agricultural importance in
Botswana:



ANNEX 18
Page 2
a)   Ferruginous Tropical Soils:  have well developed
profiles but their clay content differs giving
them a texture that ranges from loamy to sandy
clay loam. They are found along the entire
eastern border of the country with Rhodesia and
South Africa in a belt ranging from about 50 km to
around 300 km in width.
b)   Hydromorphic Soils:  young, poorly developed soils
associated with alluvial deposits around the Okavango
Swamp and the Makarikari Pan in the north central area,
and of generally low fertility.
c)   Desert and Sub-Desert Soils:  poorly developed and
extremely fragile sandy soils covering more than 70% of
Botswana's land area west of the ferruginous
soils and south of the hydromorphic soils; they are
unsuitable for cultivation but produce reasonably
nutritious grazing mainly because of their ability
to retain rain water in the upper surface layers.
d)   Calcimorphic Soils:  sandy type soils lying over
limestone subsoil which are found as an outcrop in the mid
west around Ghanzi; they produce good bush savanna
grazing.
Botswana's soil types contain high levels of sand and are particularly
susceptible to over stocking and over grazing.
Land Use
3.        The Ministry of Agriculture's estimate of present land use is as
follows:
Category                             Area (km )      Percent of Total (%)
Arable                                       13,600                2.3
Grazing (Freehold)                           29,300                5.0
Grazing (Tribal)                            410,530               70.6
Swamp and Open Water                         24,000                4.1
Forests                                       3,200                0.6
National Parks and Game Reserves            100,000               17.3
Urban and Industrial                            600                  .1
581,230              100.0



ANNEX 18
Page 3
Only part of the total tribal grazing lands are actually used for livestock
producti n at present; other areas are limited by lack of water.
4.        Botswana lacks reliable and continuous data on agricultural produc-
tion. For arable and subsistence production the best information comes from
the annual agricultural surveys; the 1971/72 agricultural survey remains the
most recent comprehensive source for such data. A smaller survey was under-
taken in 1972/73 but its findings are subject to wide margins of error; no
survey was carried out in 1973/74 due to staff shortages but questions were
included in the 1974/75 survey covering production in the previous year. In
the future the agricultural survey will be carried out annually and in 1980
an agricultural census will be conducted as part of the United Nations World
Census of Agriculture. Accurate information is available for livestock
slaughter and marketing at the Botswana Meat Commission. Cattle censuses were
carried out by the Department of Animal Health annually until 1969 and there-
after sample censuses were conducted in 1972 and 1973. A valuable new source
of information on agricultural production is the 1974/75 Rural Income Distri-
bution Survey.
Crop Production
5.        Areas suitable for crop production in Botswana lie principally in
the Hardvelt Region and, to a lesser extent, in the fringes of the Okavango
Swamp.  Current estimates set the total a ea of land suitable for cultivation
throughout the country at about 13,600 km , but no more than 15% of this area
is planted in any one year. The most common crops are maize, sorghum, millet,
beans and cowpeas, with sunflower steadily increasing in popularity.  Table 1
gives data from the 1973/73 Agricultural Survey; it indicates that only 966 km
were planted and 657 km harvested. About 7% of arable land was utilized, and
crop failure was about 32%. Per hectare yields are extremely low which to-
gether with the high rate of crop failures reflect the risks involved in
growing crops.
6.        Apart from unfavorable climatic conditions, crop production in
Botswana is beset by many constraints. These include:
(a) Shortages of rural labor created by better paying
employment in the urban centers and abroad.
(b) Dependence on borrowed or rented work oxen for land
preparation which frequently results in delays in land
preparation, late planting, low yields, crop failures
and an inability to capitalize on the meager rainfall.
Information gathered during the last agricultural
census showed that about 90% of the farmers plowed
with oxen but only around 38% of them owned their own
animals. The remainder had either to borrow or rent
work oxen from relatives or neighbors. The owners give



ANNEX 18
Page 4
priority to their own fields and make their animals
available to other members of the community only after
they have finished plowing. This problem is of par-
ticular importance for rural families headed by
women.
(c) Poor technology resulting in high losses which usually
result from factors such as failure to apply fertili-
zers, lack of weed control, and destruction of crops
by birds, insects and disease.
(d) Poor transporation facilities, rendering communications
between villages and fields difficult and time-consuming.
This greatly reduces the amount of attention paid to
the crops planted and creates problems in the transport
of inputs and products.
(e) Insufficient storage facilities which results in high
losses from spoilage and destruction by pests and ro-
dents.
7.        Agricultural production depends heavily on rainfall.  1972-73
was a drought year, followed by two favorable years. The 1974 harvest of
sorghum and grain was an all-time record of 106,000 tons; the 1975 harvest,
however, was only 63,000 tons despite good growing conditions, as farmers
carried large stocks of grain into the following year. There has been a marked
shift towards growing maize; it accounted for 46% of total grain production in
1974-75, compared to 18% in 1970-71. Sunflower seeds and pulse production
appear to be increasing.
8.        The Government's ultimate aim is to achieve self-sufficiency in
food crops. The country imported P 2.6 million and P 3.5 million (US$3.0 and
4.0 million) worth of maize and maize meal, respectively, in 1974 and 1975.
Several avenues for increasing crop production are currently being investiga-
ted by Government including the provision of credit for the purchase of work
oxen, the introduction of early maturing, drought-resistant plant varieties,
the possibilities of using chisel ploughs instead of ordinary ploughs to
reduce water losses from the soil, the development of new low-draught ox-drawn
implements, and the opening up of irrigated land principally along the fringes
of the Okavango Swamp. All these proposals indicate that emphasis will
continue to be laid on work oxen doing the bulk of the field work, despite
present over-stocking in virtually all areas where arable agriculture plays a
significant role.

Size of the National Cattle Herd and Extraction Rates
Introduction
1.        The major sources of livestock statistics in Botswana have been
livestock censuses--a byproduct of Anthrax campaigns--and agricultural sur-
veys, conducted on an enumeration basis by field staff of the Division of
Animal Health. For livestock censuses, all stock holders were required to
bring their animals to crushes to be counted; in surveys, information was
collected by interviewing holders on a sample basis. Recent experience and
studies have shown that both census and survey results in Botswana under-
estimated the livestock population in the traditional sector because of
incomplete coverage and response errors. In view of this limitation, the 1972
cattle census was conducted in two stages: a) cattle holders were required to
bring their cattle to crushes in selected areas where animals were counted by
age-sex categories and painted; and b) two days following the count, a check
survey was conducted at sample watering points associated with the crush and
for two consecutive days enumerators observed the number of painted and
unpainted cattle. The 1972 national cattle population of the traditional
sector was estimated to be about 1.9 million head falling within 1.6 and
2.2 million with 95% confidence. In 1975, the Animal Health Division carried
out an additional livestock census which gave a total population of 1.9 mil-
lion. This figure was readjusted by the Central Statistics Office, which
estimated the cattle herd to be around 2.7 million head (2.3 and .4 million in
the traditional and freehold sectors respectively). As might be expected,
there has been considerable discussion on which is the "correct" figure.
Estimating the National Cattle Herd from Offtake Information
2.        Export slaughter and live animal exports are known accurately
from data collected by BMC. Internal beef consumption, however, is not well
known. BMC's and other offtake were projected forward via a linear regression
on years fitted to offtake data 1/ from 1965 to 1975; the results for the
period 1976-1980 are shown below:

1980                    224                 55                    279

zi = 11.20 + 2.77 (-  .26) year ; 1976   12,....1980 = 16
/2   Local consumption and live animal exports.
This projection is of limited value since changes in price levels, climatic
conditions and disposable income are not explicitly incorporated in the
model except in a proxy and aggregated manner through year to year variation,
because of the difficulties inherent in forecasting future income and price
levels as well as climatic conditions.  On this basis, Botswana's offtake from
the national cattle herd would be expected to increase by about 10,000 head/
year; of this, 7,000 and 3,000 head per year would be the rates of increase of
BMC's slaughter and local consumption (plus live exports) respectively.
Size of the National Cattle Herd
3.        The size of the National Cattle Herd can be predicted by observing
that
Yi + Zi
u   =            x 100      (1)
Ni
which implies
Yi + Zi                  ,  where
x 100   (2)
AA



ANNEX 19
Page 3
Ni is the national cattle herd in the ith year, and yi and zi are the pro-
jected offtakes from BMC slaughter and other sources, respectively.  The
denominator (u) is the average effective extraction rate 1/, which can be
estimated as follows:
MI55
=Ars            -:9. Lio f  
I I
with
fi8 (                -j  I    = 3.8345  (4j)
10
4.        Equation (4) provides the information necessary to place confidence
intervals on yearly offtake rates. A 90% confidence interval for u; (the
offtake rate of the jth year) would be approximately given by:
u + 1.64 . V3.8345           (5)
with a low bound equal to 9.4 - 3.21 = 6.19% and an upper bound equal to 9.4
+3.21 = 12.61%. In (5), 1.64 indicates the abscissa of a standard normal
curve such that the area between minus infinity and -1.64 is equal to 5%
and that between 1.64 and plus infinity is also 5%.
5.        By taking 6.19% and 12.61% as lower and upper bounds for the ex-
traction rates in a given year-- such that Probability (6.19<u<12.61) = 90%,
where u is the "true" offtake rate -- the size of the cattle herd can be
predicted by applying formula (2) to the offtake data calculated before. On
this basis, the 1975 cattle herd would number around 2.5 million head and
between 1.8 and 3.7 million with 90% of confidence. Likewise, by 1980 the
national herd would be about 3.0 million and between 2.2 and 4.5 million with
90% probability (Table 1).
Probabilities associated with predicting the Natiional Cattle Herd
6.        A vector of projected offtake from 1975 through 1980 was
estimated by fitting a linear regression on past data (para 2). These
estimates can be mapped on extraction rates by using the transformation:
u = (Y + z) 100/N (6) where u, y, z are as before and N is the desired herd
size. For example, if in 1975 the herd of cattle is believed to be 2 million
animals, instead of 2.5 million, what extraction rate would have been necessary
for that to be true. The answer would be 231 x 100/2000 = 11.55% (figures in
thousands).

7.        Since the extraction rate was assumed to be normally distributed
(see equation 5) with parameters (9.4, ';.33), probability statements on the
size of the herd can be made by varying N and mapping on to extraction rates
as in equation 6. Letting N1 and N2 be two herd sizes and N the true
herdsize, Prob. (N1<N<N2)   Prob. (y + z x 100<u<y + z x 100)

where al and a2 are abscissa points of the standard normal curve associ-
ated with N2 and N1 respectively. In 1975, the national cattle herd
would be between 2.0 and 3.0 million with 68% probability and between 2.0
and 2.5 million with 41% probability; it should be borne in mind that still
the "best" point estimate would be 2.5 million. In subsequent years, the
probability that the herd is less than 2.5 million would decrease gradually
(Table 2). Thus, in 1980, the probability of the herd numbering above 2.5
million and 3.0 million would be 82% and 48%, respectively.
Deterministic Projection of the Cattle Herd in the
Traditional and Freehold Sectors
8.        Opening inventory figures were those reported in the 1975 census
as adjusted by the Statistics Division (para 1). The adjusted figures
were 2,295,000 and 370,000 head of cattle in the traditional and freehold
sectors, respectively; hence, the total cattle herd would be 2,665,000.
There is a qualitative difference between the composition of the traditional
and freehold herds 1/; freehold farmers purchase young stock from traditional
producers for finishing; hence, in the freehold sector, the proportion of
tollies 2/ is greater and the percenioa8E of cows less than in the traditional
sector. For the 1972 data, there was a statistically significant difference
between the structure of the freehold and traditional herds (chisquare = 38.7;
probability less than 1%). However, when the category "tollies" was excluded
from the analysis, the difference was no longer significant.
1/   See Annex 1, Table 5.
2/   Tollies are young steers.



ANNEX 19
Page 5
9.        BMC's 1975 throughput was approximately 190,000 head of which
95,000 came from freehold farms and 95,000 from traditional farmers; in the
same year, non-BMC offtake was estimated to be about 42,000 head. As an
approximation, this would give an extraction rate of (95,000 + 21,000)/
2,295,000 = 5.1% for the traditional sector and (95,000 + 21,000)/ 370,000 =
31.4% for the freehold farms. The latter figure clearly overestimates the
extraction rate from the freehold sector due to the above mentioned transfer
of cattle from traditional cattle posts. Likewise, the true extraction rate
of the traditional sector would be underestimated.
10.       The cattle population was then projected forward from 1975 to
1980 for each sector using the following model:
Nt = Nt_1 + Bt - Dt  o °t        (8)
where Nt is the closing inventory at year t; Bt, Dt and Ot are the
births, deaths and offtake realized during year t, and Nt-1 is the closing
inventory at year t-1.  Bt and Dt can be computed by multiplying Nt.I
by a birth rate and a death rate, respectively, for each of the sectors (see
Table 3). Using equation 3, it was estimated that the average extraction rate
is about 9.4% and the following relationship should hold:
Et 2,295  + Ef  370   =  9.4%           (9)
2,665      2,665
This simply states that the extraction rate in the traditional sector (Et)
multiplied by the proportion of the national herd in this sector plus the
extraction rate on freehold farms (Ef) times the proportion of cattle in
that sector should equal the average extraction rate, 9.4%. By rearranging
equation (9), we can generate a "feasible" region, i.e. all the extraction
rates that hold this relationship; then:
Et = 10.92 - .16 Ef            (10)
From (10), it is clear that the extraction rate in the traditional sector
cannot be larger than 10.92%. By assigning values to Et (which reportedly
varies between 7 and 9%), we can estimate the extraction rate in the free-
hold sector using equation (10).
II.       The choice of extraction rates that satisfies equations (9) and
(10) has to adhere to two constraints, namely:
(a) The extraction rate in the freehold sector cannot be
lower than that in the traditional sector; and



ANNEX 19
Page 6
(b) The extraction rate in the freehold sector cannot be
greater than the natural increase rate in this sector
(birth rate minus death rate: 18.3 - 4.7 = 13.6).
This is so because the freehold sector has been growing
historically at a positive rate; it could be argued
that this might be due to a transfer of tollies from
the traditional cattle posts, but a positive growth
rate has been also observed in the number of breeding
cows within freehold farms.
In view of these constraints, it would appear that the extraction rates of the
traditional and freehold sectors would be around 9 and 12%, respectively as
shown below:
Et              Ef
7.0             24.5
7.5             21.4
8.0             18.3
8.5             15.1
9.0             12.0
9.5              8.9
10.0              5.8
10.5              2.6
11.0            -  .5
This would imply that in 1975 the traditional sector (86% of the cattle)
provided about 82% of the total offtake and not 50% as indicated by BMC's
figure.
12.       The results of projecting Botswana's cattle herd are shown in
Table 4. By 1980, the mid-year inventories of the traditional and freehold
sectors would be 2,464,000 and 409,000, respectively. The total cattle herd
would grow from an initial 2.7 million at mid-1975 to 2.9 million at mid-1980.
The growth rates per year would be 1.3% for the traditional herd, 1.8% for
the freehold sector and about 1.4% for the national herd. The corresponding
doubling time would be:  54 years for the traditional herd, 39 years for
the freehold herd and about 50 years for the total herd. These figures do
not agree with past trends observed in the Botswana cattle herd. For example,
the cattle population almost doubled from 1965 to 1975 as reported by the
Central Statistics Office. However, their projections were based on two
disconnected sets of data and on considerably lower mortality rates 1/ than
those used in this report.

Analysis of Ranch Development Models
A. Background
1.        This annex describes proposals for ranch development in areas zoned
"commercial" under the TGLP, and presents the results of analysis of herd
development and financial results under a variety of "with" and "without"
Project scenarios. In summary, proposed ranch developments aim at the
transformation of "cattle posts", located outside village areas, mostly in the
sandvelt, on land that will be zoned commercial, into ranches similar to those
now operated in freehold farming blocks and in APRU's network of ranches. It
is assumed that overstocking and, consequently, degradation of the range is a
problem on many of these cattle posts.
2.        The analysis presented is based on:
(a)  Research by APRU on existing cattle posts and demon-
strated results of APRU's ranches run under their
system of "reasonably acceptable management". These
indicate that, before development, the typical
operation of a cattle post is one of a complete
cycle, i.e. breeding - fattening, with some sales of
younger steers to be finished in freehold ranches.
Cattle management standards are low: estimates of
production parameters are 45% calving rate, 10% calf
mortality, slow pre- and post-weaning growth (around .4
kg and .3 kg a day, respectively), and extraction rates
around 7-10%, because it takes 5-7 years for the
animals to reach slaughter weight. Research results
indicate that productivity can be doubled with provision
of external and sub-divisional fencing (3-4 paddocks),
maintenance of proper stocking rates, disease prevention
and control, mineral supplementation, seasonal breeding,
and early weaning;
(b) Experience with freehold land ranching under similar
ecological conditions; offtake remains relatively high,
and ranching operations of this type have been carried



ANNEX 20
Page 2
out in Botswana for decades with apparent financial success.
There is no evidence that tliis production system has caused
significant range deterioration; and
(c)  Observations by the mission, which visited a number of
cattle posts, and supplemented surveys and interviews
conducted by the Project preparation team of the
Botswana Government.
3.        The analysis is subject to many uncertainties.  Foremost, since no
leases under the TGLP have yet been allocated, it is particularly difficult to
assess: (a) the carrying capacity of the land in which the prospective ranches
would operate; (b) the current status of the range; (c) the likely size and
structure of the pre-development herd; and (d) the financial position of
-ttle post operators. Further, knowledge about range degradation, and above
i1 range recovery has many limitations and gaps.
B. The Models
4.        Ranch models presented here are tentative and hypothetical and may
not provide an answer for all production circumstances encountered in the
rangelands of Botswana. The base line, "pre-development" position for cattle
posts and the models for ranch development were estimated under varying
assumptions, as summarized in Table 1. Two production systems are compared
against a baseline cattle post: the multi-camp model and the ranch model;
these are described in greater detail below (paras. 10-11). This triplet was
simulated under two assumptions of potential carrying capacity (475 vs. 400
animal units 1/), two assumptions on range status, and two alternatives of
pre-development sales 2/ (steers only vs. steers plus tollies).  Thus, there
would be 3 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 24 different combinations, of which 12 are discussed
in this report, namely those under the assumption of 475 animal units (A.U.)
of potential carrying capacity. Technical and financial results associated
with the 400 A.U. models are available ini a working paper. It should be noted
that the carrying capacity of 475 A.U.'s corresponds approximately to the 400
A.U. 's used in thu preparaLion Leport, jbt- to different weightings of age
categories.  With this adiustmenit, the :,Azt- of the final herd inventory in
developed ranches is approximately the same as that used in the preparation
document; the opening inventory in the present report is 18% larger.
1/   In this report, one Animal Unit (A.U.) would correspond to any animal
older than 12 mionths of age; ages OtiOW 12 months correspond to zero
A.U.
2/   This for Year 0 only.  Thereafter, it is assumed that cattle posts
sell cull females also; this because pre-development sales of this
category were not established in the preparation report.



ANNEX 20
Page 3
5.        Given uncertainties about the pre-development situation for the
average cattle post owner, and because there is likely to be consider-
able variation in actual ranch development plans, given different geographic
conditions and pre-development positions, the analysis considered a range
of assumptions and a less intensive, more gradual investment model.
Opening Inventory
6.        The pre-development herd would have about 570 animals (474 A.U.);
its structure is presented below:
Number of
Category                   Animals                 %

1-2 hr. Steers                     48                  8.4
2-3 yr. Heifers                    35                  6.1
2-3 yr. Steers                     30                  5.3
3-4 yr. Heifers                    27                  4.7
3-4 yr. Steers                     19                  3.3
4-5 yr. Steers                     22                  3.9
5-6 yr. Steers                     18                  3.2
Total                        570                100.0
These assumptions were obtained by surveying a limited number of cattle posts
in areas where leases for commercial development are likely to be granted, it
is therefore, not fully representative of the average herd in the traditional
sector. For example, the 1972 census indicates that the average traditional
herd had about 40% cows, 2.1% bulls, 17.7% calves, 16.4% heifers (22% in the
hypothetical herd) and 23.7% tollies and oxen (24.1% in the hypothetical
herd). Since the opening herd was not in equilibrium, cattle post models
were projected throughout the lifetime of the project to provide an adequate
baseline for comparison; hence, "with" and "without" Project tests are based
on intra-year comparisons between the development proposal in question and the
appropriate cattle post rather than against a fixed pre-development situation.
Another peculiarity of the opening inventory of the hypothetical herd is that
within a given age category, there is always a deficiency of males. Other
than the sampling variation occurring from surveying a limited number of herds,
this might be a reflection of sales of immature males ("tollies") for finishing
in freehold ranches. To account for potential sources causing this "unbalance"
two assumptions on "modes" of pre-development sales were made, as discussed
below in para 8.
Assumptions on Initial and Final Range Status
7.        In models with codes 1, 3, 5 and 7 (Table 2) it is assumed that the
virgin carrying capacity of the range is maintained constant due to main-
tenance of adequate stocking rates. Models where range degradation occurs



ANNEX 20
Page 4
(2A, 4A, 6A and 8A, - Table 2) correspond to hypothetical cattle posts where
there is overstocking. In these cases, it is assumed that the initial carry-
ing capacity is 20% lower than the potential carrying capacity of 475 A.U.
(Models 2A and 4A) or 400 A.U. (Models 6A or 8A). In subsequent years, the
range deteriorates at a rate of 8 A.U. per anuum due to continued overstocking
and stabilizes when a further 20% of the initial carrying capacity is lost.
Thus about 36% of the virgin carrying capacity is lost throughout the process.
1/  In cattle posts where there is overstocking before development and improvet
management is introduced (Models 2B, 2C, 4B and 6B, 6C, 8B, 8C - Table 12), it
is assumed that the range recuperates its potential carrying capacity in six
years. Intermediate points are obtained by fitting a growth function as
indicated in Table 2. It is also assumed that multicamp and ranch systems
recuperate the range at the same speed.
Assumptions on Pre-Development Sales
8.        The survey of cattle posts which furnished the baseline data for
the predevelopment situation indicated a sales level of 34 and 40 steers
older than 5 years for the carrying capacity models of 400 and 475 A.U.
respectively; sales of culled females could not be quantified. In this
report, there were two variations of cattle post sales (Tables 12 and 13):
(a) Old steers and culled females (10% of the cow herd p.a.)
are sold throughout the life of the cattle post and
the extraction rate fluctuates around 7-10%, and
(b) Same as in (a) plus younger steers ("Tollies") sold
at a rate consistent with the sex unbalance detected
in the opening inventory as follows:
% of steers to be sold
Age (years)         in following year

The fact that cull cow sales are ignored in year 0 of the project does not
affect "with" and "without" project tests since ranch developments are
compared intra-yearly against a changing cattle post rather than against a
static predevelopment situation.

Assumptions on Production Systems
(i) The Cattle Post
9.        Four cattle post models for about 6,400 ha each are discussed
here (IA, 2A, 3A, and 4A - Table 1), which represent combinations of two
range statuses with two modes of sales. The technical coefficients asso-
ciated with projecting such cattle posts are presented in the "Cattle Post"
column of Table 3. Weaning rates of 50% and 45% are assumed in undegraded
and degraded cattle posts, respectively. These are somewhat higher than the
average weaning rate in the traditional sector; it was assumed that those
cattlemen requesting loans provide a somewhat better standard of management
than that available in the average cattle post. Adult mortality is assumed to
remain constant at 10% to cover against drier periods. Fixed operating costs
represent labor, and maintenance of watering facilities, fences, yards and
existing buildings; variable operating costs represent veterinary care, sup-
plementation, water operation, miscellaneous, stock purchases and contingen-
cies. Details of costs are in Annex 9.
(ii) Ranch Models
10.       Four ranch models (IC, 2C, 3C and 4C - Table 1), representing
combinations of range status and modes of pre-development sales are presented.
Ranches are of 6,400 ha (8 km x 8 km) and have complete boundary fencing and
internal subdivision into 4 paddocks for cows/heifers, weaners, bulls/steers
and an additional one to allow for some rotational grazing and/or adjusting of
stocking rates in the remaining paddocks. There would be firebreaks parallel
to the boundary fences which would be extended to bisect the ranches each
way to make four potential grazing areas (total: 48 km of firebreaks per
ranch). A kraal and crush would be provided as well as buildings, tools and
supplies and upgrading of current watering facilities (Annex 9, Table 1).
Technical coefficients associated with projecting these ranches (Table 3)
are based on data from APRU and would call, inter alia, for an increase in the
weaning rate from 50% to 70%, a decrease in adult mortality from 10% to 7%,
increased cow and heifer culling rates, lowering of age at breeding and
finishing and above all, maintenance of correct stocking rates. Technical
coefficients are shown in Table 3.
(iii)   Multicamp Models
11.       The four multicamp models (lB, 2B, 3B and 4B; Table 1) represent
combinations of range status and models of pre-development sales. These
models would be similar to ranch models except that instead of edternal and
internal subdivision a weaner camp (1 Km ) and a bull camp (1 Km ) would be
provided. Since there has been no documented experience in Botswana with
these multicamp models, the adopted pathway of technical coefficients (Table
3) is tentative. However, this model is presented to illustrate an invest-
ment alternative.

C.  Model Outputs
12.       Six different herd projections associated with models 1A
through 4C are presented in Tables 4-9. They consist of four cattle
post projections (1A, 2A, 3A and 4A), one multicamp projection (IB, 2B, 3B and
4B) and one ranch projection (IC, 2C, 3C and 4C). The reason for this was that
the range recuperation projections (2B, 2C, 4B, 4C) behaved similarly to their
steady state counterparts; this was due to the fact that herd increase pro-
ceeded more slowly than pasture regeneration (see Table 12). Furthermore,
multicamp and ranch models were not affected by making different assumptions
on modes of pre-development sales; this, of course, had a marked effect on
cattle post projections.
13.       The basic principle underlying ranching development is that manage-
ment standards are increased by providing the means to control stocking rates
thirough fencing and firebreaking, early weaning, seasonal breeding, vigorous
culling of unproductive females and availability of improved watering facilities.
As illustrated below, offtake levels could be doubled through the effect of
improved management in increasing weaning rates and lowering mortality, age
at breeding and finishing as indicated in Table 13.
(i) Ranch and Multicamp vs. Cattle Post in Undegraded Range
14.       Ths comparison is presented in Tables 10 and 12 for the two predev-
elopment sales assumptions. A cattle post with about 570 animals (474 AU)
in year 0 (Table 10), selling steers and cull cows throughout and extracting
7-9% of its herd, would gradually reduce the inventory due to the fact that
the techinical coefficients would not allow it to replace itself. For this
reason, only 77% of the potential carrying capacity of 475 A.U. would be
utilized after 20 years and the sales would decline from 40 to 37 animals.
On the other hand, the cattle post selling steers, cull cows and tollies
throughout (Table 12) would present a similar picture, except that the final
herd would be smaller, the extraction rate would fluctuate around 10% and
predevelopment income would be considerably reduced by year 20. Multicamp and
ranch systems would considerably increase sales, extraction rates and range
utilization.  Compared ag2alist the baseline of cattle post IA, ranching
development would be financially attracsive both compared with the predevelop-
ment situation or on a "without" vs. "'with" basis. In the latter case, the
rates of return for multicamp and ranch models would be about 18% and 14%
respectively. Compared against the baseline of cattle post 3A, where steers,
cull cows and tollies are sold throughout, multicamps and ranches would not be
financially attractive when contrasted with the pre-development situation but
would yield a rate of return of 9.7% lic;d 9.8%, respectively on a "with" vs.
"without" basis.
(ii) Ranch and Multicamp vs. Cattle Pjst in Degraded Range
15.       This comparison is presented in Tables 11 and 13 for the two pre-
development sales assumptions. A cattle post selling steers and cull cows



ANNEX 20
Page 7
throughout (Table 11), in which the range is gradually degraded, would end up
utilizing only 55% of the carrying capacity due to a considerable reduction in
herd size. In 20 years, the sales would decrease from 40 animals to 27 animal
and the net income would be reduced by about 40%. Improved systems would
significantly increase sales, extraction rates and range utilization. Com-
pared against the baseline of cattle post 3A (Table 11), ranching development
would be financially attractive both compared with the pre-development situa-
tion or a "with" vs. "without" test. In the latter case, the rate of return
both for multicamp and ranch would be about 14%. Compared against the baseline
of cattle post 4A (Table 13), multicamps and ranches would not be financially
attractive compared against the predevelopment situation but would yield a
rate of return of 11.6% and 11.5% respectively on a "with" vs. "without"
basis.
(iii) Stocking Rates
16.       Models 2A and 2C (which provide the basis for the analysis of the
Project as carried out in Volume I of this report) were further analyzed to
illustrate the occurrence of stocking rate differentials in the "with" and
"without" project situation.
17.       As indicated in Table 1 of this Annex, in the case of Models 2A
and 2C it is assumed that the range has 20% destruction before development,
i.e. a cattle post with a potential carrying capacity of 475 A.U., has an
actual carrying capacity of 380 A.U. If overstocking in the cattle post
continues unchecked, the range deteriorates at a rate of 8 A.U. per year
and stabilizes when a further 20% of the initial carrying capacity is lost,
that is, at 304 A.U. On the other hand, if improved management is intro-
duced, it is assumed that the range gradually recovers until it reaches
its potential carrying capacity of 475 A.U. The transition from 380 to
475 A.U. is simulated via a growth curve as shown in Table 2. Although
range research in Botswana has not yet obtained data on the likely pace
of range recovery following the introduction of improved management, the
mission collected empirical information supporting the assumption described
above. For example, the competent Rhodesian manager of the Makalamabedi
ranch indicated that he observed much more dramatic cases of range recov-
ery under similar conditions within his country.
18.       In conjunction with the "with" and "without" project herd projec-
tions (Tables 1 and 2 of Annex 6 or 6 and 7 of this Annex), the foregoing
assumptions allow to project stocking rates as presented in Table 14. In
terms of has. per A.U. there is a clear advantage for the ranch model. Over
a period of 14 years (excluding year 0) the weighted average stocking rates
are 14.3 and 12.0 has./A.U. for the "with" and "without" project situations,
respectively. This is particularly true for the earlier years of develop-
ment for which the amount of herbage available - as indexed by has. per A.U. -
would be 20-30% higher for the ranch model.

a/ Stocking rates are at or below potential carrying capacity which is 400 A.U.
(Models 5A, 5B, 5C, 7A, 7B, 7C) or 475 A.U. (Models LA, 1B, 1C, 3A, 3B, 3C).
Animals below 12 months of age are equal to 0 A.U. Animals above 12 months
of age are equal to 1 A.U.
b/ In cattle posts where there is overstocking, it is assumed that the initial
carrying capacity is 20% lower than the potential carrying capacity of 400 A.U.
(Models 6A, 8A) or 475 A;U. (Models 2A and 4A). In subsequent years, the
range deteriorates at a rate of 8 A.U. per annum due to continued overstock-
ing and stabilizes when a further 207% of the initial carrying capacity is lost.
Thus a 36% of the potential carrying capacity is lost throughout the process
(400 x .2 + 320 x .2 = 144 and 144/400 = .36. Likewise, 475 x .2 + 380 x .2
171 and 171/475 = .36).
c/ In cattle posts where there is overstocking before development and improved
management is introduced (Models 2B, 2C, 4B, 4C and 6B, 6C, 8B, 8C), the
range recuperates in six years. Intermediate points are obtained from fitting
the growth curve:
(A-B/t)
Yt = e           such that  Y1 = 320 or 380 and Y7 = 400 or 475
Note that: Yl corresponds to "before development" since the growth
function is not defined for t = O. It is also assumed that multi-
camp and ranch systems recuperate the range at the same speed.

SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Service Companies
Background
1.        The preparation report proposed that the Project support the
development of 12 "service companies", each with about 13 member ranches.
Ranchers were expected to purchase equity in the company (financed by a
loan); a board consisting of one representative from each member ranch
was to decide on services the company should offer, fees, and to appoint
a company manager. On behalf of member ranches, the service companies
%ere to engage in material purchasing and delivery, construction of water
facilities, buildings, fences and firebreaks, provision of stand-by pumps
and engines, the service and repair of equipment, and management assistance
in planning, budgeting and breeding. The initial capital cost of establish-
ing a service company was estimated at P 52,000, or P 4,000 per ranch; annual
fees and charges would be about P 1,000 and P 995, respectively, per ranch.
In addition, it was expected that an expatriate general manager and accountant
would oversee development, and supervise 12 service company managers; total
management costs were estimated at P 1,237,500.
2.        The Government's proposals for service company development were
modelled on an existing service company in Kenya, Allied Ranching (Taita)
Ltd., which appears to be functioning successfully. This company is prin-
cipally owned by seven participating ranches in Voi, Coast Province. There,
a total of over 700 shareholders participate in the ownership of the ranches
(whose development was financed under an IDA credit). Allied Ltd. provides
overall management guidance to the complex. Technoserve, Inc., a private
aid agency based in Connecticut, USA, has provided technical and management
support to Allied Ltd., and holds a share in the company's equity. The
Government of Botswana therefore approached Technoserve, requesting that
they consider providing comparable support for service companies under
the project. It was hoped that Technoserve would establish a base in
Botswana, acting in a private capacity, and negotiate directly with
potential service companies seeking their assistance; they would require
a permanent general amanger and accountant, and would identify, recommend,
supervise, and pay managers of service companies.
3.        During the TGLP consultation, the service company concept was
broached with groups of livestock owners; it was also explicitly discussed
during project preparation and appraisal. In order to test the legal and
sociological, and general feasibility of the idea, the Project preparation
team worked with farmers who were likely to secure leases to the Nojane
ranches developed under the first livestock development project; they
reportedly responded enthusiastically, and agreed to form the "Dong Dong



ANNEX 21
Page 2
Service Company". At the time of appraisal, the ranchers were discussing
legal aspects of incorporating as a service company, and had begun to
recruit a manager for it.
Conclusions of Appraisal Mission
4.        Technoserve, Inc. at the invitation of the Government of Botswana,
participated in the appraisal of the Project, with a view to possible involve-
ment in service company development; the general manager of Allied Ranching,
Inc., of Kenya was made available for the appraisal. The mission discussed
service company development with potential ranchers and Government officials.
5.        In general, the mission concluded that, while there is clearly a
critical need for services and management support, the service company
concept as presented is not feasible or financially viable at this stage of
development and Technoserve indicated that they cannot support the program
as proposed. The principal problems are:
(a) Costs would be too high in relation to ranch size and
expected benefits;
(b) Service companies would be too small to provide adequate
economies of scale;
(c) The interest of ranchers in service company development was
unclear; the concept of forming a company and purchasing
equity seemed quite alien except where very extensive
discussions had occurred. Needs varied widely from region
to region. Willingness to finance the companies remained
unproved; and
(d) Likely membership of service companies remained uncertain;
if service companies could benefit relatively small farmers,
then the initial high cost of development might be justified,
whereas if wealthy cattlemen stand to benefit, such support
is more problematic.
6.        Despite these reservations, the mission supported the underlying
concept and objective of service company development - to encourage ranchers
to share facilities and equipment and to seek management advice and support.
However, it appears that a flexible program, based initially on effective
extension efforts by NDB aimed at convincing farmers of the need for such
developments would be essential.
7.        In July 1977, the Government agreed without reservation with the
suggestion that the service company component be entirely deleted as a part
of the Project. Although Technoserve had not replied formally to the Govern-
ment on the request for assistance, direct contacts between Technoserve
and Bank staff clearly indicated that assistance would not be provided along



ANNEX 21
Page 3
the lines originally proposed. However, it was agreed that the spontaneous
development by ranchers of service companies or other grouping should be
encouraged and that the design of the Project should incorporate such
flexibility.
8.        Although the provision of services to new ranchers remains the
most problematic aspect of the proposed Project, there have been encouraging
developments which provide a framework of support for ranch development.
For example, the existing network of Livestock Advisory Centers (LACs) is
being expanded and their scope of activity widened in conjunction with a
project being considered by EDF designed to strengthen basic extension
services and infrastructure for livestock in the communal zones. The
LACs, should in the future, be able to supply most materials required for
ranch development and operation. Further, the Ministry of Agriculture has
recently created a ranch management capability which would enable to provide
technical support for ranch development.

SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
National Policy on Tribal Grazing Land:
Government Paper No. 2 of 1975 (July, 1975)
PART I: INTRODUCTION
General
'[he time has come to tackle a subject about which there has been a lot
of talk but not much action - the better use and development of our land.
AE our human population and the numbers of our cattle and other live-
stock increase there is a growing danger that grazing will be destroyed
by uncontrolled use of communal grazing areas by ever growing numbers of
animals. Once grazing has been destroyed it is extremely difficult to
get grass re-established. And under our communal grazing system it
is in no one individual's interest to limit the number of his animals.
If one man takes his cattle off, someone else moves his own cattle in.
Unless livestock numbers are somehow tied to specific grazing areas no
one has an incentive to control grazing....  We are faced with a situa-
tion which demands action.' (Address by the President, Sir Seretse
Khama, to the fourteenth Annual Conference of the Botswana Democratic
Party at Mahalapye, 28 March 1975.)
2. Proposals are made here for implementing Government policy on grazing
land development. This means changing the traditional system of land
tenure in the tribal grazing areas. It will change the Botswana way of
life; it will affect, directly or indirectly, virtually every Motswana.
3. It is vital that the need for change and the reasoning behind the Gov-
ernment's proposals are fully understood.
4. It is proposed to change only present practices regarding use of grazing
land, not the way arable lands are allocated or used.
Background
5.  The Government's policy on tribaL land development was set forth in
Government Paper No. 2 of 1973, National Policy for Rural Development.
It is further explained in the National Development Plan 1973-78. The
main issues were set out in Government Paper No. 1 of 1972, Rural Devel-
opment in Botswana and by the consultants R. Chambers and D. Feldman in
their Report on Rural Development (1972). The aims are to stop over-
grazing and degradation of the veld; to promote greater equality of
incomes in the rural areas; and to allow growth and commercializa-
tion of the livestock industry on a sustained basis.



ANNEX 22
Page 2
6.  Not much has been done until recently about making the policy a real-
ity. While what should be done was clear, it was hard to decide how
it should be done. Mistakes made at the beginning could be hard to
correct later on. In particular, there is a need from the start to
protect the smaller stockowners and those who own no cattle. They
must be given a chance along with the large owners to benefit from
development of the cattle industry.
7.  The Government now intends to bring in the new policy for grazing
land. There are people who fear what can happen if the old ways of
land holding and land use are changed. For example, some fear that
the small owners will be forced to move and the rich will come to
control all the land. The Government recognizes that these fears
exist but is convinced that through careful planning and consulta-
tion with the people the dangers can be avoided. Planning will aim
to ensure that land development helps the poor and does not make them
worse off.
PART II: THE PRESENT SYSTEM AND WHY IT SHOULD BE CHANGED
Present Opportunities
8.  The Ministry of Agriculture has developed an improved system of range
management. Although it is simple to use it allows us to raise many
more cattle on the same amount of land. At the same time favourable
beef prices offer tempting profits and higher incomes than ever before.
9.  There has been a dramatic response to the favourable beef prices.  The
cattle population has risen rapidly to nearly two-and-a-half million
head, and the BMC has slaughtered and maarketed an unprecedented number
of animals. Unfortunately, these increases have had two bad effects
under the present system.
Range Deterioration
10. Increased herds, under the system of uncont:r3lled grazing, have led
to serious overgrazing around villages, surface water sources and
boreholes. Overgrazing has led to sheet erosion and bush encroach-
ment which reduces the amount of good grazing. This is worst for
the small cattle owners, most of whose herds graze in the village
areas.
Wealth and Poverty
11.  As a result of the pressure on village grazi,g areas, richer people
are drilling more and more boreholes for cattle posts in sandveld
areas which used to be empty. Borehole rights have been granted to
any tribesman who can obtain finance.  T1 i cily centrol is the rule



ANNEX 22
Page 3
calling for five miles between boreholes. Under the present system,
the wealthier cattle owners secure virtually exclusive rights to the
land around their boreholes. More and more grazing land gets taken up
by a few large cattle owners. Meanwhile those who own only a few live-
stock stay where they are in the village areas with little hope of
improvement. As the numbers of people and their cattle increase
year by year, good grazing becomes scarcer. It therefore becomes
more important to ensure that the available grazing is properly used
and equitably distributed.
12. Improved systems of management and allocation of land will deal with
these problems. One of the bad effects of the present system is that
no one, rich or poor, can reap the benefits of improved management.
In the communal grazing areas, only basic veterinary care is possible.
Even the larger owners with remote cattle posts can do little without
fencing. The result is low returns for all.
13. We must alter the old system. If we go on as we are doing now, not only
will production and profit per hectare go down every year, but the gap
between rich and poor will grow bigger. If we can remove the limita-
tions of the communal grazing system, everyone will benefit.
14. This does not mean that a completely different system should be ir, -o-
duced. There are good aspects of the traditional system which must
preserved. Most important is the right of every tribesman to have as
much land as he needs to sustain himself and his family. The grazing
land policy will protect this right.
15. The policy will also protect the rights of those who have been granted
allocations under the old system. These have been made according to
the terms of the Tribal Land Act, as will allocations under the new
system.
PART III: THE ALTERNATIVE - IMPROVED GRAZING AND LIVESTOCK MANAGEMENT,
MUCH MORE MONEY, BETTER DISTRIBUTED TO MORE PEOPLE
16. The aim of the Government's grazing land policy and the proposals out-
lined in Parts IV and V below is clear.  It is to provide cattle owners,
large and small, with ways of increasing their farming incomes. To
achieve this, better range management is essential.
17.  The output and profit from cattle can be more than doubled by using
very simple methods of management (rotational grazing, controlled
breeding, early weaning, daily watering, bonemeal feeding). Correct
stocking rates, and paddocking to permit some rotational grazing, will
halt deterioration, allow the grass to improve, and provide standing
hay for the dry season. All that is needed is some fencing and some
piping of water. Land can carry more cattle if it is fenced and



ANNEX 22
Page 4
watered than if it is open. Properly run group and individual ranches
can carry twice as many head as under uncontrolled grazing. The im-
proved system also provides more incentive and makes it easier to
build fire breaks and control veld fires.
18. Improved management, especially fencing, allows land to be used to the
full, with the best returns to the farmer. But farmers who have or
can get money to invest must have an incentive. Under the traditional
system there is no incentive - it is in no one person s interest to
conserve the grazing in a particular area. It is a free for all.
Stockowners should be given complete control over the areas where
their animals graze. They will then have an interest in looking after
that grazing.
19. The next section describes how the present land allocation system can
be changed so that improved management is possible.
PART IV: HOW THE ALTERNATIVE CAN BE ACHIEVED -
BY A NEW SYSTEM OF LAND ALLOCATION
Objectives
20. The basic objectives of changing the present system are:
(a) To make grazing control, better range management
and increased productivity possible. The improved
management system must start with fenced areas
and land over which exclusive rights are recog-
nized. Therefore under certain conditions,
groups and individuals must be granted exclu-
sive rights to land.
(b) To safeguard the interests of those who own only
a few cattle or none at all.
21. To meet both these aims, Government will encourage Land Boards to
divide the tribal grazing areas into three zones - Commercial Farming
Areas, Communal Grazing Areas, and Reserved Areas. The terms of tenure
and the type of development permitted will be different for each zone.
Commercial Farming Areas
22. In these areas, groups and individuals will be given exclusive rights
to specific areas of grazing land. A defined number of hectares of
land will be allocated, not simply the use of a borehole as is now
the case. Ranch development will be encouraged, including fencing
and piping of water.



ANNEX 22
Page 5
23.  Leases will be granted in Commercial Farming Areas, and land in these
areas will cease to be held in the traditional way. Rents will be
payable to the local authorities in return for the exclusive rights
given in the lease.
24. Proposed rules for allocation and development in Commercial Farming
Areas are set out in Part V. These areas are not meant only for the
large individual cattle owners. First priority will be to help groups
of smaller owners to run commercial ranches. Preference will be given
to such groups in making allocations.
Communal Grazing Areas
25. In these areas the traditional communal grazing system will not be
changed and no rent will be paid. These will be mainly the present
communal grazing areas near villages.
26. Although tenure in the communal areas will not be changed, we must
find ways to teach people better management and how to solve the
problem of overgrazing. Until stocking rates are brought into line
with the carrying capacity of the land in all communal areas, it will
be impossible for farmers in those areas to make any real progress.
Reserved Areas
27. These areas will be set aside for the future. They are safeguards
for the poorer members of the population. Suitably large areas of
grazing will be reserved and guaranteed for future use by those who
have only a few cattle at present. In addition to reserved grazing
areas, land may be reserved for alternative uises such as wildlife,
mining and cultivation.
Better Income Distribution
28. Closing the gap between rich and poor depends on the smaller owners
having the opportunity, the knowledge and skills to increase their
herds.  Thie opportunity -Will be provided by tlle rules which will be
laid down for allocation and land use. The Ministry of Agriculture's
extension services will supply the knowledge and skills. It is also
essential that Land Boards should bear the interests of the poorer
people constantly in mind, especially when considering how much land
should be reserved for future use, when working out ways to help
groups of smaller stockowners and in collecting rents to use in de-
veloping the communal areas.
29. It is urgent to tackle the problem of overgrazing in the village areas.
Stocking rates will be brought into line with the carrying capacity
of the land by:



ANNEX 22
Page 6
(a) encouraging the larger owners to remove their
herds and start commercial ranches, and
(b) by land boards controlling the amount of stock
which may be kept in the communal areas. Mafisa
cattle will be counted as belonging to the holder.
When the larger herds have gone, small owners
will have more opportunity to improve manage-
ment and increase production.
30.  The use of existing and new private dams, wells and boreholes for
watering livestock in communal areas will be restricted. Individ-
uals will not be allowed to have private water sources for watering
more animals than the maximum laid down by the Land Board. Persons
wishing to have a private water source for watering more animals than
the maximum set by the Land Board will be required to seek a commer-
cial allocation. The only exception is that groups or co-operative
ranches will be permitted in communal areas whenever there is full
agreement within the community. These groups will be encouraged to
fence and develop water supplies for their ranches.
31.  Private boreholes used for domestic or arable agriculture purposes
will be permitted.
32.  The Ministry of Agriculture is working out how best to form groups
of small cattle owners. Pilot projects will be set up in different
parts of Botswana. People will be told how to copy the successful
systems.
PART V: THE RULES FOR ZONING, ALLOCATION AND LEASES
Responsibilities
33.  Carrying out the policy will be the task of the Tribal Land Boards.
This section shows how Land Boards will:
(a) Zone land.
(b) Allocate land within each zone.
(c) Grant leases.
34.  Government will guide the Land Boards in the execution of this policy.
It will give advice and then allow each Land Board to decide how to
implement the policy in the light of conditions existing in its area.
Each Land Board area has different characteristics and zoning and allo-
cation policies will differ accordingly.



ANNEX 22
Page 7
How Tribal Land will be Zoned
35. Zoning will be the first step. The objectives of zoning are:
(a) To manage the land in the best interest of the people and their
descendants.
(b) To provide security for subsistence farmers with respect to
arable land, grazing of draft animals, milk production, and
smallstock, now and in future.
(c) To preserve village grazing areas now under communal use.
(d) To induce people to move cattle out of overstocked areas.
(e) To encourage fencing and improved management on existing cattle
posts in order to improve offtake and carrying capacity.
(f) To reserve areas for national purposes, including wildlife,
mining, etc.
(g) To reserve areas for future ranching and/or communal use.
36. To achieve these objectives the following RULES will apply:
(a) Existing areas of communal use will be kept communal.
(b) Areas where people already have control of blocks of land, such
as sandveld cattleposts, will be classified commercial, unless
there is a special reason for including them in communal zones.
(c) If communal areas are already overcrowded, they will be made
bigger.
37.  A series of practical steps needs to be taken.  We must have the facts
about the present situation, before deciding how big the commercial
areas can be. The steps will be:
(a) Map the actual boundaries of existing grazing and lands areas.
(b) Map all existing and potential water sources and collect other
survey data.
(c) Decide which areas are best for different purposes.
(d) Assess potential demands for different categories of land over
the next fifty years.



ANNEX 22
Page 8
(e) Decide how much land is left for commercial development after
taking into account communal, reserved and national needs.
38.  An interim policy is needed for allocating grazing.  In special cases
commercial areas will be allocated in 1975 and 1976, even before public
consultation has been completed, and while the main programme is getting
under way. This is necessary to avoid bringing new investment in the
livestock industry to a halt during the planning period.
How People will Use the Communal Areas
39. Under the new system the following RULES will apply in the communal
areas:
(a)  Each Land Board will say how many livestock units may be kept
by one person, family or group on various communal land areas.
Those who exceed the maximum allowed should move to commercial
farming areas.
(b)  Permission will continue to be granted for fencing of arable
lands.
(c)  Livestock management groups of small owners will be permitted
to fence land allocated to them in communal grazing areas. (In
practice 'small owners' will be those who have fewer cattle than
the limit fixed by the Land Board for individuals in the communal
area.)
(d)  In enforcing the maximum number of cattle which can be kept
in a communal area, cattle kept under the mafisa system will
be counted as belonging to the holder.
(e)  New individually-owned private boreholes will not normally be
permitted in communal areas, except where an individual requires
a borehole for domestic and agricultural purposes and watering a
few stock on his lands. In such cases no-one will be permitted
to water his stock in excess of the limit laid down by the Land
Board. Individually-owned boreholes where owners are watering
more stock than the limit laid down will be phased out over
time. This will be done by helping such people to move to
commercial areas, or by requiring them to form a syndicate or
group with other stockowners, where this can be done within the
carrying capacity around the borehole.



ANNEX 22
Page 9
How Land will be Allocated in Commercial Areas
40.  The objectives of the allocation policy are:
(a) To encourage fencing and improved management on existing cat-
tieposts and to improve offtake and carrying capacity.
(b) To encourage movement out of presently overstocked areas.
(c)  To encourage and promote groups of smaller cattle owners to
participate in commercial ranching.
(d) To control the amount of tribal land occupied by any one owner.
(e) To encourage resident management.
(f)  To allow access to watering facilities for all cattle owners.
41. To achieve these objectives the following RULES will apply:
(a) Cattle owners in areas zoned for commercial ranching will, over
a period of time, have to take out leases over their holdings.
All new allocations in commercial areas will be the subject of
leases.
(b) No borehole permissions will be granted to people who have
drilled without Land Board permission.
(c) Allocations in commercial areas will only be made to individuals
and groups who own a specified minimum number of livestock.
(d) Where a group owns enough cattle to get land in a commercial
area, it will be given preference over an individual.
(e)  Where a group or an individuial owns enoough cattle to get land
in a commercial area, preference will be given to those who
have not already got one or more cotmcrcial leases.
(f)  Preference in allocating will be given to people from the most
heavily overstocked communal areas, subject to paragraph 41 (c),
(d) and (e) above.
(g) Each Land Board will say how many land holdings and what total
area an individual may have, taking into account the total land
holding of the individual in all parts of Botswana. This will
mean that those who own large numbers of boreholes may have to
surrender some.



ANNEX 22
Page 10
(h) Where persons or groups wish to have more land than the Land
Board allows, Government will take positive steps to enable
them to secure holdings in freehold and state leasehold areas.
(i) No commercial lease will be given over any existing borehole
-until satisfactory watering arrangements have been made for
owners of all stock currently using that borehole if any of
them are to be excluded from the commercial lease.
(j) A proper legal framework will be devised for groups or syndicates
of farmers to enable them to obtain commercial leases.
(k) All borehole applications including those already approved but
for which boreholes have not been drilled will be reviewed
and evaluated in accordance with these rules.
(1) If a cattlepost owner is required to move under these rules,
compensation will be payable.
Terms of Leases
42.  Leases will be granted, as at present, under Section 21 of the Tribal
Land Act, as common law leases.
43.  The objectives of the terms of leases are:
(a) To give the security of tenure necessary for the taking and
granting of loans and for the introduction of improved manage-
ment systems. Leases must be for a sufficient length of time
to allow holders to recover their investments and some profits.
(b) To retain ownership of land by the Tribal Land Boards.
(c) To encourage and enforce improved management systems and to
avoid destruction of tribal land through overgrazing and ero-
sion.
(d) To avoid speculation in leases and failure to use the leasehold
for the purpose intended.
(e) To ensure that local authorities receive a return from those who
acquire the privilege of exclusive use of tribal land.
44. To achieve these objectives the following RULES will apply:
(a) A period of fifty years, after which the lease will be
renewable, is generally recommended although circumstances
in a particular area may require shorter leases.



ANNEX 22
Page 11
(b) Leases will be revocable only under clearly defined terms and
procedures provided for in law.
(c) Rents will be charged and effectively collected.
(d) There will be restrictions on the transfer of leases, subject
to safeguards for those who have provided loan finance.
(e) Leases will be inheritable for the duration of the lease.
(f) Subletting, and sub-division of holdings will only be permitted
with the approval of the Land Board, which approval will not
unreasonably be withheld.
How the Rules will be Applied in Different Areas
45.  As stated above, it will be necessary to adapt the proposed rules
to the circumstances pertaining in each tribal area. The rules
outlined have been determined primarily with the large tribal
areas of Ngwato, Kweneng, Ngwaketse, and Tawana in mind. The
smaller areas such as the Tati, Kgatleng, Rolong, Malete, and
Tlokweng may find that the demand for land in their areas ex-
ceeds the total land available. It will therefore be necessary
to be flexible in the application of the rules.
PART VI: STAGES AND TIMING OF IMPLEMENTATION
46.  The changes described in this Paper will not happen overnight.
Land development, especially if it is to be consistent with
social justice, is a very long-term process which will con-
tinue not just for years but for decades. What is important
now is to make a start.
47. The grazing land development programme may be described as a
series of steps:
Step Number                Action to be Taken
Preliminaries
1                    Provision of base maps
2                    Sandveld survey
3                    Village areas survey
4                    Ground and surface water survey

8                    Lease arrangements
Development
9                    Formation of groups and
organization of communal
projects
10                    Loan funds and administration
11                    Ranch development
12                    Marketing arrangements
13                    Enforcement and monitoring
Steps I to 4 should be taken as soon as possible over the next few
years, so that the new system can start on a properly planned basis.
Some districts will complete this stage faster than others as they
have already done much of the work. Zoning and allocation can begin
as soon as the facts are known. The Ministry of Local Government and
Lands, in consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture, will examine
each Land Board's overall zoning and allocation proposals to ensure
that they conform with national planning and policy principles.
48. Although Land Boards will be responsible for carrying out the policy,
they are badly in need of more trained staff, technical expertise,
and advice. They will be strengthened as quickly as possible, but
will need a lot of help from Government in the early stages.
49. As indicated in paragraph 38, the first areas for commercial devel-
opment will be identified quickly, to allow a start to be made on
removing some of the larger herds from the communal village grazing
areas and to allow those who acquire commercial allocations to begin
developing their ranches.
50.  It will take at least two years to plan and raise money, to give
loans, and to put in boreholes, water reticulation, fencing and
extension support in the commercial areas. A planning team will
prepare this project.  In the meantime, while the public is being
informed and consulted about the policy, local authorities and



ANNEX 22
Page 13
fLiela staff will press on witih making proposals for such ranch
development as is possible and desirable in 1975 and 1976 with the
mcney and manpower already available.  Some livestock owners will
be able to develop commercial ranches with minimal assistance and
their efforts will be guided to fit in wi.th the overall policy.
51.  There are a nuimber of issues and implications which arise from this
programme which will be further studied and dealt with.  These are
the availability of puiblic transport, water equipment and fencing
materials, the requirements for roads, borehole maintenance, physi-
cal and social infrastructure and the implications for settlement
patterns of the future. The implications of this programme for
freehold and state land policy must be considered.
52.  It wil'l be necessary to monitor and evaluate the changes in land
use under this policy, and their effects, from the outset. The
key matters to be considered are:
(a) Thie changing size and distribution of land hold-
ings under the policy.
(b) The effects of the policy on the ecology in
communal and commercial grazing areas.
(C) The efficiency of the process of allocating
Land by Land Boards.
(d) The effects of the policy on rural incomes.
(e)  The state of public opinion and the effec-
tiveness of public consultatio-n about the
progralamme.
(f) Tihe efficiency of group and co-operative ranch
development in both communal and commercial
areas.
PART VII:  PUBLIC CONSULTATION ABOUT THE NATIONAL
POLICY ON TRIBAIL GRAZING LAND
53.  As was emphasized at the beginning of this Paper it is vital that
the public be informed of the need for change and the reasoning
behind the Government's proposals. The implications, consequences,
costs and benefits - from the poi-it of view of the livestock owner
and the villager - must be sufficiently clear for general public
understanding. It is most important that the dangers of misunder-
standing be recognized and avoided.



ANNEX 22
Page 14
54. Therefore, before implementation begins the Government will mount
a nation-wide public discussion of the programme and the issues
involved. People at every level will be fully informed and con-
sulted before the process of change is set in motion.
55.  The purpose of the public information campaign must be made quite
clear. It is not intended to steamroller public opinion. Most
members of the public know nothing about land development policy.
We have now reached the stage of deciding how to implement grazing
land policy, provided it receives widespread public support. But
more than explanation is involved. Government wants to encourage
wide public discussion of the policy. And so the first aim of the
public information programme is to provide information on the
policy. But it has three other aims as well: to stimulate public
discussion; to provide information to Land Boards, District Coun-
cils, and Central Government on how people feel the policy should
be implemented locally; and to start a long process of helping
people to know how they can benefit from the policy by, for exam-
ple, forming groups or syndicates of small cattle owners. Thus
the programme of information and consultation will encourage com-
ments, ideas and reactions from the districts, in order to make
implementation as smooth as possible.
56. Parliamentary Debate will be followed up immediately by a programme
of radio talks and public speeches by Ministers at Council and Kgotla
meetings. A multi-media consultation programme, based on this Govern-
ment Paper, will be launched. It will use radio programmes, with
printed materials, and will be co-ordinated with the work of exten-
sion and other field staff. Councils, District Development Commit-
tees and VDCs will be asked to encourage public discussion, and take
note of it, as part of this programme. Extension staff will help
to organize the systematic feedback of public reactions to the pro-
gramme.
57. Having obtained the views of the public in the ways described above,
the Government will take appropriate action to give effect to these
views. If necessnrv, it will revise the policy set out in this paper
and present for Parliamentary approval the changes brought about by
the process of consulting the people.
