1. General Description
1.1 Project Background
1.1. 1 Project Source
The proposed Luan-Shucheng-Sanhe highway section is one of the highway
maintenance component of Anhui Province applying for the World Bank loan. This
component is selected from more than 400 highway sections totaling 8000km long,
based on the comparison conducted by Anhui Provincial Communications
Department of China. The criteria of selection for the highway maintenance
component are: ( 1 ) Beneficial to the economic development in the poverty stricken
areas; (2) Favorable to transportation centralization and decentralization of the main
route (Hefei-Anqing Highway ) ; (3) Fitted for the provincial 10t five-year plan of
highway improvement, and priority given to the sections which have started
construction and completed tasks of subgrade widening or land acquisition under the
9' five year plan so as to improve efficiency of the whole route and the highway
network; (4) The existing road sections cannot meet the increasing demand for
transportation and need rehabilitation. (5) The average indicators (PQI) of road
pavement quality are low and pavement is poor.
Luan-Shucheng-Sanhe section is located in the middle and west areas of Anhui
Province where the major transportation relies only on road for there is no railway to
reach these areas. Therefore the improvement of road pavement and the increase of
the communication capacity directly relate with the local economic development and
people's living quality. As the economy develops and the transportation increases, the
existing road with narrow pavement and poor quality cannot mect the demands of
economic development and transportation. Thus, Anhui Provincial Communications
Department is applying for the World Bank loan (remaining savings) to support the
rehabilitation of Luan-Shucheng-Sanhe highway section for the sake of improving
the condition of transportation to the outside in the poverty stricken area, stimulating
local economic development and bettering the people's life.
According to the requirement of Anhui Provincial Communications Department of
China, in July, 2001, Anhui Provincial Highway Administration Bureau entrusted the
job to Hefei Design & Research Institute, Ministry of Coal Industry, of environmental
assessment and preparation of the environmental impact assessment on Luan-
Shucheng-Sanhe section of highway maintenance.
1.1.2 Status of Environmental assessment
The assessment unit, after accepting the entrustment, set up an environmental
assessment group in July 2001. The group together with Anhui Provincial Highway
Administration Bureau and Anhui Provincial Highway Survey and Design Institute
carried out field visits and public participation and consultation along Luan-
Shucheng-Sanhe highway section. The group conducted deep field investigation
relatingts environmental status and environmental protective targets along the section.
Based on the site visits, data collection and further study of the project feasibility
I



study report and under the direction and assistance of the environmental experts of the
World Bank, the group worked out the draft "Environmental Impact Report of Luan-
Shucheng-Sanhe Section of Highway Maintenance Component of the World Bank
financed Anhui Provincial Highway Project of China". Now the report is submitted to
the World Bank for review.
1.2 Aim of the Environmental Assessment
The report shall make qualitative or quantitative anticipation analysis and assessment
on the possible environmental impact caused by the project construction, on the base
of the investigation into the natural and social environment and enviromnental quality
within the assessment scope of Luan-Shucheng-Sanhe section, and combined with
the understanding of the environmental status and relative environmental issues along
the section. The report shall point out the potential problems and propose effective
and reasonable alleviating measure correspondingly. The alleviating measures shall be
put into practice to reduce the environmental impact during the project construction
and operation to the lowest degree. The following targets shall be reached as well.
( I ) Possible environmental impact during the construction as well as the impacted
scope range and degree shall be fairly and objectively identified.
( 2 ) Investigation result shall be presented in the report based on the understanding of
the public opinions via the investigation along the section.
(3 ) Various measures of prevention, alleviation and reduction to the lowest degree of
the negative impact shall be proposed, established on the result of environmental
impact anticipation and applicable compensation methods shall be proposed as well.
The aim is to identify negative impact before the construction, raise attention in
finalizing the design document and bid contract, and carry out the alleviation methods
during the construction period.
(4) The Environmental assessment shall work as decision making reference,
provided to the highway administration departments and local government institutions
along the section in making environmental administration plan and environmental
development programs.

3. Environment Description
3.1 Natural Environment
3.1.1 Topography
Luan-Shucheng -Sanhe section is located between Huai river and Changjiang
river and belongs to Jianghuai hilly area, high in the northwest and low in the
southeast. The front part is generally hilly, up and down, while the later part is plain
of smooth terrain.
3.1.2 Meteorological Phenomena and Climate
Luan belongs to warm temperate and monsoon climate zone which has the climate
features described as evident monsoon, clear four seasons, changeable spring, rainy
summer, clear and crisp autumn, cold winter. The climate is suitable for the growth of
wheat, oil crop, bean that prefers cold weather and proper for the growth of paddy rice
and cotton that prefers warm weather on the contrary. Table 3-1 shows the major
meteorological parameters of project areas.

Note: Data are extracted from national economtc statistics of the year 2000 of Luan City and
Shucheng County
3.1.3 Soil Vegetation
Yellow and brown soil is the main soil of the local soil type and the paddy soil is the
second.
The whole area is classified as the vegetation belt mixed of deciduous leave, broad-
leaved evergreen and coniferous forest. There is little natural vegetation due to the
long time of human activities. At present, most existing vegetation on both sides of
the road and around houses are planted, namely white poplar, ailanthus, pagoda-tree,
locust, platen, paulownia; Farming crops are wheat, paddy rice, bean, oil crop, peanut,
cotton, vegetable, melon and fruits.
3.1.4 Soil Erosion Status
China is one of the countries that lose soil and water seriously. As is published, the
lost soil and water has reached 367X 104km2, accounting for 38% of the total land,
among which, soil erosion of Changjiang River amounts to 62 X 104km2, occupying
16.9% of the total.
According to the Class of soil erosion type of China, Luan belongs to southern red
13



soil hilly area, having hydrodynamic erosion as the main feature. It is identified in the
data provided by Luan Municipal Water Resource Bureau, local soil erosion modulus
is 2150tIkm2 . a, ranking as slightly eroded. The soil loss amount exceeds 500Stkm2
* a of soil unit loss allowance set by the state.
3.1.5 Water Resources Status
(1) Pavement Water
There are two major water systems in Luan area. Pi river, Shi river, Feng river, Ji river
and Dongfei river originate in Dabie mountain and are interior rivers, flowing from
south to north and into Huai river, belonging to Huai river system. Hangbu river and
Fengle river also originate from Dabie mountain and flow from west to east into
Changjiang river by way of Cao lake, belonging to Changjiang river system. As
reported in "Anhui Province Statistics", local amount of pavement water resource is
about 9.21 billion m3 in total in the normal year. Per capita occupation is 1 650m3. The
volume of water crossing this region is about 320-530 million mi3. The storage of 5
natural lakes of Chengxi lake, Chengdong lake, Wabu lake etc. in the middle stream
of Huai river amounts to 780 million m3 in the normal year. The water that could be
used is about 500 million m3. However water resource scatters unevenly, with much in
the south while less in the north, much in the mountains while less in the hills, much
in the summer while less in the winter.
(2) Underground Water
The underground water storage in the west of Anhui (Luan district) is estimated at 695
million m3/a. The underground water with good quality and rich quantity, is mainly
replenished with rainfall and constrained by climate, topography and geology
structure and generally buried under 3-10m. Most residents along the highway
section drink the underground water according to the investigation.
3.1.5 Natural Resources
The natural resources along the highway are fine iron sand, alta-mud and comish
stones and their storage are 8 million tons, 0.94 million tons and 2.4 million tons
respectively. The mines of the resources have been conducted in a small scale. The
other resources such as lime, marble and dolomite are located near Dabie
mountainous area and the shortest distance from the highway is about 30km.
3.2 Ecological Environment
3.2.1 Natural Ecological Environment
The project is located-in the slight hilly areas between Jianghuai Plain and Huaibei
Plain where the history of human activities is very long and there is not any group of
large-sized wild animals and large belt of natural vegetation. There is few rare wild
animals or vegetation to be protected in this place. The man-planted vegetation and
small wild animals could be seen within 200 m away from the highway, including
forestry in the mounds, green belts on both sides of the highway, farming crops in the
fields and various small wild animals as frogs, snakes and insects as well.
14



3.2.2 Agricultural Ecological Environment
The project covers the areas of Luan City, Shucheng County and Sanhe Town which
are featured for agricultural farming areas. The main crops along the section are
paddy rice, wheat, oil crop, com, sweet potato and cotton and there is also forest in
some areas. The crop output is usually high due to the suitable climate, rich soil and
convenient irrigation. The paddy rice output is 500 kg/mu. The wheat output is about
300 kg/mu. The oil crop output is about 150 kg/mu. The corn output is about 400
kg/mu.
The people living nearby raise livestock and fowls, including pigs, cattle, sheep,
chicken, ducks and geese etc.
The raised aquatic products of the project areas are fishes like bighead, silver carp,
crucian, carp and grass carp.
The trees along the road are man-planted as poplar, platen, paulownia and willow and
grow fine. Arbors are planted in the town and villages along the road and nearby, such
as poplar, platen, paulownia, elm and metasequoia etc. Besides, there are some tea
gardens, fruit trees of peach, pear, apple and so on. Local farmers plant various
vegetables as greens, peppers, pumpkins and white gourds etc.
The implementation of the project would not involve with any land acquisition and
resettlement. There would be little impact on the agricultural ecological environment,
natural vegetation and ecological environment along the highway. Certain amount of
trees shall be destroyed during the construction and would be replanted once highway
rehabilitation is completed in accordance with the designed greening program.
3.3 Social Environment
The project covers the areas of Luan City and Shucheng County. The basic
information of the project areas is shown in table 3-2.

The project is located in the west of Anhui Province uhere is less developed. Highway
is the major way of transportation. In addition, Luan City (county level) and
Shucheng County are listed as the state poverty stricken countries. The local per
15



capita GDP is compared with per capita GDP of the whole province presented in the
Table 3-3.

Note: The data are extracted from "Anhui Provincial Statistics in 2000"
The above table presents that per capita GDP of Luan City and Shucheng County only
accounts for 58.2% and 53.4% of per capita GDP of the province. The project is
believed to improve the existing transportation capacity and condition, increase the
flowing in and out of the goods and people, create more opportunities for the poor
countryside with less developed communications, in particular, to benefit social
economic development along the highway.
3.4 Living Quality
The investigation shows that municipal and county governments pay much attention
to education. There are 15 middle and primary schools along the highway and
students reach more than 7960. Around 99 % of proper aged children are educated
in the school. Most schools have the buildings of 2-4 floors. One of the schools is a
private school named Luan City Nanshan School and has about 600 students and
occupies 46600m2 land. Various social resources and channels are mobilized to
promote people's cultural knowledge. In addition to the schools set up by the
governments, all kinds of training classed are held to update people's skill and
capacity. Table 3-4 shows enrollment ratio of primary schools and middle schools in
Luan City and Shucheng County.

Note The data are extracted from Statistics m 2001 of Luan City and Shucheng County.
There are 3 township hospitals along the road, containing 18 ward beds and curing
common diseases. Serious patients must be sent to city /county hospitals. In the past,
16



patient's safety was greatly challenged subject to inconvenient transportation. The
road improvement could better the healthy condition of rural residents and benefit the
immediate save of senrous patients in this sense.
The living quality of local residents would be impacted due to the poor pavement of
the highway and noise of the vehicle.
To sum up, the project shall improve the pavement quality, better the transportation
condition, decline TSP and noise of traffic. As a result, the social economic
development and local people's living quality shall be much improved.

The environment noise of daytime 46.8-54.7dB (A) , nighttime 35.7-39.8dB (A)
presented in the table 4-1, basically meets the limit of Class I stipulated in
"Environmental Noise Standard in Urban Areas" (GB3096-93) . The quality of
environment noise along the highway is good.
4.1.2 Status of Environment Air Quality
Luan City Nanshan School and Qianrenqiao Middle School along the highway were
selected as monitoring points for the assessment of environment air. The monitoring
record is shown from the table 4-2.

Table 4-2 shows that average daily concentration value range of TSP of major
pollutants is 0.04-0. l 6mg/m3  and average hourly concentration value range of NO2
and CO of major pollutants are 0.006 - 0.058mg/m3 and 2.29 - 5.34Mg/m3
respectively. The daily top value of TSP and hourly top value of NO2 and CO are
both below the limits of Class 1 set out in "Environment Air Quality Standard",
which means the quality of environment air of sensitive points along the highway is
good.
4.1.3 Status of Pavement Water Environment Quality
Table 4-3 shows the monitoring record of major rivers crossed over by the highway.

Table 4-3 presents that concentration value of COD0, and BOD5 of the major
pollutants contained in the water body of Luli river and Baojia river is below the limit
of Class V classified in "Pavement Water Environment Quality Standard". The water
body of major rivers along the highway is proved good quality.
4.2 Investigation into Industrial Pollution Generators
According to the investigation into industrial pollution generators, there are not any
large sized constant industrial pollution generators along the highway, except for
some small brickyards, township agricultural side products processing plants and
social service sectors. Due to the poor pavement of the highway, much instant TSP is
produced when vehicles pass by. This impacts air environment of the highway to
some degree but the impact is limited. Meanwhile, air whistle loud speakers are used
frequently so that noise dB exceeds the limit instantly.
4.3 Special Environmental Investigation
According to the investigation along the highway and consultation with Luan
Municipal Cultural Relics Administration Sector and Luan Municipal Forestry Bureau,
there are not any natural protective zones, cultural relics, historic sites or wild animals
or plants which need protection, within 200m away from the central line of the
highway. Further investigation shows there is not any natural protective zone within
20km away from the highway either. However, in case any buried ancient graves or
historic ruins are discovered, the contractor shall report to local cultural relics and
historical site administration bureaus. The contractor shall not go on constructing until
relative departments complete concerned work.
The evidential documents of the investigation provided by relative units are attached
to the report.

5. Forecast and Evaluation of Potential Environmental Impact
5.1 Construction Period
The road pavement "rehabilitation" of Luan-Shucheng-Sanhe section covers a
whole length of 80km. The existing width of the subgrade of Luan-Shucheng-
Sanhe section is 15-18m and the width of the pavement is 6-14m. It is designed to
widen the road pavement to 14.0 m with asphalt macadam on the basis of the existing
subgrade during the construction period. Therefore, this project does not involve in
land acquisition or settlement. The negative impacts of the construction on the nearby
environment would cover the following aspects:
5.1.1 Impact on Acoustic Environment Quality
(1) Noise from the machinery in the construction period
During the construction of this project, various machines and vehicles would be used
and the tested noise values are showed in Table 5-1. The main machinery contains
shovel loaders, road rollers and paver buckets that would make unavoidable noise
during the construction. The transportation of construction materials like cobblestones,
sand, cement and asphalt macadam would increase the traffic volume and impact a
larger scope. Besides, the construction concentrates on widening and strengthening of
the road pavement. As the mixing process of asphalt macadam would be done in the
station, the transportation of pavement materials would cause traffic noise increasing.
Nevertheless, the adding value of noise is rather small compared to the existing traffic
volume.

Note The construction machmery and the noise values are extracted from "Standards for
Environmental Impact Evaluation in Highway Construction (Trial Implementation)" (JTJ005-96)
Most of the section passes through open fields and the rest passes through towns and
villages. During the implementation of the project, the noise of construction and
traffic would impact the quality of the residents' life on both sides of the road.
Occasionally the noise in the daytime might slightly surpass the limit [ >55dB (A) ].
The investigation shows that the construction of Luan-Shucheng-Sanhe section
comes across 18 major environmental sensitive points, such as Luan Nanshan School,
Baoqiao Primary School, Qianrenqiao Middle School and Qinqiao Clinic. The details
are presented in the following Table 5-2. Because the sensitive points of noise impact
22



on schools and hospitals on both sides of the road is generally between 30-160m, the
noise of construction and traffic might generate negative effect on the teaching of
schools and acoustic environment of wards of hospitals.

Attenuation type of point sound source would be applied considering the types of
machines and their noise. Vehicles for transportation would be regarded as sound
source in the construction. The following Table 5-3 is the estimate of noise level
generated by main machines and vehicles to different distances during the
construction.

"Noise Limits of Construction Site" (GB12523-90) stipulates: noise of construction
site is limited to 70-75dB (A)  in the daytime and 55dB (A)  at night. Table 5-3
shows that impacted distance by the noise of machinery is within 50m in the daytime
and the distance beyond 50m meets the regulated noise limit. At night, the distance
beyond 300m can basically meet the noise limit.
According to the investigation, within the distance of 50m to the sensitive points of
noise on either side of Luan-Shucheng-Sanhe section, Luan Nanshan School,
Huangnidian Primary School, Lianhuayan Primary School, Baiynag Primary School,
Shucheng No.3 Middle School, Baoqiao Primary School, Baiyang Hospital and
Hangbu Hospital will be impacted, and the rest of schools and hospitals are beyond
the distance of 50m. Thus, the noise of construction (mainly the noise from the wheel
shovel loader) in the daytime might generate certain impacts on part of the schools
and hospitals.
(2) Noise from the asphalt mixing station
The asphalt mixing station will be set up at the maintenance squad during the
construction. On the investigation of the site, there are no environmental sensitive
points (such as schools, residential areas, sanatoriums or hotels) to be protected within
200m. Based on the analogy monitoring to the asphalt mixing station by Hefei
Environmental Monitoring Station, the actual tested noise values are shown in Table
54.
The actual tested values show the noises of the asphalt mixing station ( the machine is
about 40m away from the site boundaries) are 53.4-54.6dB (A) in the daytime and
41.9-44.8dB (A) at night at the places 1.0m from the boundaries. So the noise
values in the daytime and at night are both lower than the "Noise Limits for Site
Boundary of Industrial Enterprises" (GB12348-90) Class I

standards
By the analogy monitoring, the noise of the asphalt mixing station can meet the
requirements of "Urban Areas Environment Noise Limits" Class I. Therefore, it is
believed in the evaluation that the noise will not impact the environment and people
nearby.
5.1.2 Impact on Environment Air Quality
(1) Road dust
During the construction period, the flying dust is mainly caused by the wind erosion
on the bare road pavement. The flying dust depends upon the travel speed of the
vehicles passed by, the wind speed, the dust volume on the road and the dust humidity,
among which the wind speed directly depend on the transmission distance. According
to the monitoring to the Beijing-Tianjing-Tangshan Highway in the construction
period by the Highway Institute of MOC, the TSP density was 5.093 at the distance
150m leeward, exceeding the "Environment Air Quality Limits " (GB3095-1996)
Class 11. The analogy monitoring on the flying dust in the similar condition is shown
in Table 5-5.
TSP of the Construction Road

The table shows that the necessary watering will reduce the flying duct 50%-80%
during the construction. The impact on air environment will be distinctly decreased.
(2) Tail gas
As the transportation increases, the NO2 and CO in the tail gas by vehicles increase as
25



well. The analogy monitoring conducted within the distance of 30m on either side of
the road shows that the average density per hour of NO2 and CO is 0.037-0.066
mg/m3 and 0.95 - 1.65 mg/m3, which meet the limits of Class Ir set in "Environment
Air Quality Limits" (GB3095-1996). Therefore, it can be said that the NO2 and CO
in the tail gas by the increasing vehicles will not pollute the air environment on either
side of the road.
(3) Asphalt lampblack
In this project, the asphalt macadam used to pave the road pavement needs heating.
When heated and paved, asphalt lampblack is created and impacts the air environment.
The major pollutants are THC, TSP, BaP and etc., in which BaP is poisonous. In the
relevant documents, the closed decocting technology will keep the density of BaP less
than S0.0001 pi g/m3 at the distance 5Om leeward, lower than the standard value 0.01
hg/m3 in the "Environment Air Quality Limits" (GB3095-1996) Class ll. As long
as the mixing station is kept 50m away from the sensitive points, towns or villages,
the major pollutant BaP will not impact anywhere. But, taking the unfavorable
meteorological conditions into account, it is considered in the evaluation that the
station should be set up at the distance 200m leeward away from the sensitive points,
towns or villages.
(4) Construction campsite
The main pollutants in the construction campsite are TSP and SO2 from the cooking
stoves. As the campsite is set at the distance 200m leeward away from the
environmental sensitive points, the impact on the air environment is slight.
5.1.3 Impact on Ecological Environment
In case of the implementation of the project to widen and reinforce shoulders of the
existing road into road pavement, there would be little impact on the biological
environment. Some weeds on the shoulders and part of bush vegetation would be cut
and destroyed. Around 5300 trees in the investigation might be cut in the course of
widening the road. There is not any grassland along the road. Since no land
acquisition occurs, vegetation of fanning field on either side of the road would remain
the same as before. The vegetation beyond the both banks of the road would be
protected through stressing the environmental ideas among the workers to reduce the
impact to the lowest degree.
In addition, some TSP pollutants would be generated due to the mixing of pavement
materials during the construction and would land on the vegetation and leaves of
crops. Thanks to the rich rainfall in this area, the TSP landed on leaves would be
rushed away with the rainwater and would not stay long, the impact on the growth of
plants is negligible.
5.1.4 Impact on the Pavement Water
During the construction period, the impacts on the water environment involve in the
following aspects: the residential wastewater and garbage in the construction campsite,
the wastewater of washing machinery and the dropped machine oil in maintenance,
26



and the watering when rolling the road.
(1) Watering in the construction
During the works of rehabilitation of pavement, water content would be kept for
pavement reinforcement in the rolling to reach the required degree of enforcement.
Limited water would be used for the mixing of reinforcing materials and rolling. The
water would be absorbed by materials of pavement and leave little water into the side
ditches and farming land. Consequently there is no impact on water environment.
(2) Residential wastewater in the construction campsite
There are 2 contract sections in this project, and each has set upl campsite, so there
are 2 campsites. On the basis of the existing construction rules, each section has about
40 workers. The water used is limited, for there is no bathroom in the campsite and
the toilet without water (dry toilet). In the investigation to the actual water
consumption in the Hefei-Anqin Highway, the maximum water used is about 60 I/p/d,
that is, the water consumption in each campsite comes up to 2.4m3/d and the
wastewater is about 2.0m3/d. Therefore, the residential wastewater has little impact on
the pavement water. As long as necessary measures are taken, the impact on water
environment can be reduced to very little.
(3) Wastewater of washing machinery and dropped machine oil in maintenance
When the machinery needs repairing and washing in a rainy day, the water used is just
a little. Generally it can go directly into the ground, with little impact on the pavement
water.
There is no maintenance station in the construction, and all the repair work is done at
the maintenance shops in the city or county. As result, no dropped machine oil in the
construction site will impact the pavement water.
(4) Residential garbage in the construction campsite
The residential garbage of the workers is rather little. It amounts to about 20kg in each
campsite in term of 0.5kg/p/d. It is collected in a garbage bin, and then carried to the
treatment stations in the nearby city or county. Therefore, the residential garbage will
not impact the pavement water.
5.1.5 Impact on the irrigation system
During the works of rehabilitation of road pavement, the road will pass through some
of the irrigation system in the farmland. Attention will be paid not to block the ditches,
canals or culvert with the construction materials so as to let the water through. So the
construction will have no impact on the water environment and the irrigation system.
5.1.6 Impact on traffic in the bridge construction
The major rivers passed by this project are Fengle River, Wuli River, Qianrenqiao
River, Baojia River, Luli River, Yaoxi Branch Canal, Shigang Branch Canal and
Laoyan River. Along the whole road, 9 large or medium bridges will be built with a
hole diameter of 13-20m and a length of 580.08m. 13 small bridges will be built
27



with a hole diameter of 10 - 16m and a length of 291.66m. The vehicles and people
can pass through the existing bridges in the construction. So the bridge construction
will not impact traffic. It has been considered in the design that the vehicles and
people can go by a temporary path while small bridges are under construction. There
will be some impacts, but very little.
In addition, the structure of the bridge base will be enlarged by stone concrete, a small
part of it will be piles. Consequently attention must be paid not to drop the materials
into the river when pouring the concrete, avoiding polluting the water of the river.
5.1.7 Impact on Soil and Water Conservation
This project lies in tiny hills between Changjaing and Huai Rivers and the impacted
area is small, so soil erosion caused by loss of soil and water in the construction is not
serious. According to the documents provided by Luan Irrigation and Power Bureau,
the soil erosion modulus in this area 2150t/km2 . a, and it belongs to light erosion. In
terms of 2150thkm2 . a, the total volume of soil and water erosion will amount to
2890t in this construction. Some measures will be taken in order to decrease the loss
of soil and water.
5.1.8 Traffic Environment and Others
In order to keep the traffic open during the construction, half of the road is under
construction which might inevitably cause jam and impact traffic environment to
some degree. However the negative effect is only temporary.
5.2 Operation Period
5.2.1 Impact from Traffic Noise
This project will come into the operation period once the project is completed. As the
traffic condition is improved, the traffic volume of various vehicles in Luan-
Shucheng-Sanhe section will increase year by year. The traffic volume would
increase from the average 3121 no./ d in the year of 2001 to 12439 no./d in the year of
2025. The noise impact of traffic would rise as the traffic volume grows. However,
the traffic condition would be greatly improved after widening the pavement of the
road. Although the towns and villages along the road would be impacted, most of
houses on both sides of the road are for commercial purpose. As a result the number
of directly impacted people by the traffic noise is restricted.
15 primary and middle schools and 3 hospital are located on either bank of the road
within 200m. All of these schools and hospitals have enclosing walls as high as 2m
which are 30-160 m away directly from the road. Although the pavement of the road
and its condition is improved after the construction, the traffic noise would increase as
the traffic volume grows. Estimate of environmental sensitive points of traffic noise in
Luan-Shucheng-Sanhe section is presented in the Table 5-6.

The estimate shows that, in the year 2005, the impact of traffic noise on the
environmental sensitive points at the distance of <50m        outdoors would exceed the
requirements of "Urban Areas Environment Noise Limits" (GB3096-93 ) Class I by
0.7-4.3dB (A) in the daytime and 1.5 -7.OdB (A) at night. After the year 2010, the
impact of traffic noise on Nanshan School, Huangnidian Primary School, Lianhuayan
Primary School, Baiyang Primary School,Shucheng No.3 Middle School, Baoqiao
Primary School, Baiyang Hospital and Hangbu Hospital at the distance of <50m
outdoors would exceed the requirements of "Urban Areas Environment Noise Limits"
(GB3096-93) ClassIbyO.5-5.ldB              (A) inthedaytimeand2.3-7.8dB            (A) at
night. The maximum exceeding value in the daytime and at night will be outside the
classroom of Baoqiao Primary School, 30m away from the center of the road.
5.2.2 Impact on Environment Air
During the operation of the project, the increasing emission of NO2 and CO would
29



grow on environment air along the road corresponding to the rise of traffic volume by
years. The forecast of the traffic volume in the operation period would be average
5671 no./d in the year of 2010 and 9885 no./d in the year of 2020. Table 5-7 shows
the forecast of the tail gas in Luan-Shucheng-Sanhe section.

NO,       0 0042   0 0015   0.0005   0 0071   0.0026   0.0010
The forecast shows that, as the traffic volume increase in the operation period, the
forecasted density of NO2 and CO emitted by vehicles will be lower than the limits in
the Class II (GB3095-1996). Moreover, the road lies in the tiny hilly area with 3m-
wide green trees on both sides. This design can make full use of the green belt to
absorb the air pollutants. And this is beneficial for air diffusion. Consequently the
emission of NO2 and CO generated by vehicles would slightly impact the air
environment.
After the completion of Luan-Shucheng-Sanhe section, the traffic condition of the
road would be improved greatly. The TSP produced by vehicles would decrease
correspondingly compared with the existing road. The impact of TSP on the sensitive
points would decline as well.
In conclusion, the potential environmental impact of this project are traffic noise and
slight tail gas.
5.3 Other Environmental Problems
On the basis of the features of this "rehabilitation" project and the description of
environment, the evaluation group thinks that the suggested project involves no
sensitive areas, therefore, the impacts on the following environmental problems are
tiny or can be neglected:
(1) There is slight impact on wild animals, for there are no species of wild
animals.
(2) There are no natural protection areas, scenic spots, cultural relics or histonc
sites along the road.
(3) The "rehabilitation" project will not fetch or discard the earth, so there are no
ecological problems.
(4) This project involves no land acquisition or resettlement.

6. Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan
6.1 Environmental management Organization
Anhui Provincial Communications Department will be responsible for the overall
environmental management. Luan Highway Administration Bureau will be in charge
of implementation and operation. Ahui Environmental Protection Bureau, Luan
Environmental Protection Bureau and Shucheng Environmental Protection Bureau
will be responsible for the routine supervision. The environmental supervision plan is

6.2 Possible Environmental Impact Compensation Measures
6.2.1 Design Period
6.2.1.1 Keep Building Materials and Mixing Station Far Away from Environmental
Sensitive Points
Luan    Shucheng   Sanhe section is a rehabilitation project of widening and
strengthening on the basis of the existing highways. On the analysis of the potential
environmental impact factors, the stacking sites of the building materials carried from
outside and the material mixing station should be kept far away from towns,
residential areas, schools, hospitals and beyond 200m leeward when designed.
The site for the mixing station is selected in the sandy dyke 5km southwest of
Shucheng. The mixer is made in Quanzhou, Fujian Province, equipped with dust-
provention apparatus. The asphalt will be melted in an oil tank with a volume of 200t
and a hot-oil conducting device. This kind of mixer can effectively stop producing
asphalt lampblack and reduce the flying powder.
6.2.1.2 Dig Side Ditches and Build Road Slopes
In the design, side ditches and culverts along the road will be improved, and the
slopes of the subgrade will be built with bricks and vegetation.
32



6.2.1.3 Water to Reduce the Road Dust
In the material mixing and the construction procedure, watering equipment must be
designed in order to water the easily-dusting materials and decrease the dust. In the
dry weather, it is necessary to water 4 times to reduce the dust pollution to the nearby
environment.
6.2.1.4 Greening
In the design, 3m-wide green belt outside the road shoulder on both sides of the
highway and the slope protection works have been taken into account. In addition, 3
rows of arbors and bushes will be added in the sensitive points, such as schools and
hospitals. The varieties of vegetation should be properly selected.
6.2.1.5 Safety Signs
71 sets of traffic signs and 4395 warning posts have been designed in the crosses,
sensitive points, main sidewalks and etc.
6.2.2 Construction Period
The potential environmental impacts in the construction period involved in the traffic
are noise and road dust. The following mitigation measures are suggested:
6.2.2.1 Select a Site for the Asphalt Macadam Mixing Station
The mixing station will be set up, in line with the design, 5km away from Shucheng
and the sensitive points. Central yard mix is suggested and the mixed materials will be
carried by trucks to each section for pavement so as to reduce the noise radiation to
the residents along the highway, especially to the schools, hospitals and towns passed
through and reduce the impact of the asphalt lampblack on the people's health.
6.2.2.2 Control the Construction Dust
In the construction period, it is necessary to water the easily-dusting sections and
materials in a fixed time, especially in the sections passing through villages and towns,
4 times/day according to the design, in order to reduce the dust pollution to the nearby
environment.
6.2.2.3 Store Bulk Materials and Prevent Dust
Bulk materials must be stored 200m away from the sensitive sites of schools,
hospitals, towns and villages. In dry days with strong wind, the easily-dusting bulk
materials must be covered by canvas or plastic cloth to prevent the air pollution in the
construction sections.
6.2.2.4 Treat Wastes
Owing to all the building materials carried from outside, there are few wastes. If any,
the action of central disposition in each section will be taken to conserve the water
and soil.
6.2.2.5 Protect Crops
The construction unit has the responsibility to tell the staff and workers to pay
33



attention to protecting the fields and crops along the route and not to destroy the
farmland, so as to decrease the damage to the crops.
6.2.2.6 Ensure Traffic Order
The half-side pavement will be used in the rehabilitation project, thus traffic block
will not be avoided. In the construction sections, warning signs or detour signs must
be put to ensure the project quality and keep the traffic in good order. There must be
assigned persons in charge of conducting the traffic.
6.2.2.7 Water and Soil Conservation
When working with the fill or excavation, the exposed slopes must be done with
vegetation. Some slopes and side ditches must be built up with bricks or stones, as
designed, to stop the water and soil being washed away in the operation period.
6.2.2.8 Prevention Measures in Bridge Construction
It is suggested in the bridge construction that the surplus earth be used to strengthen
the embankment of the river to reduce the block of river course and loss of water and
soil. Moreover, it would be better to build the bridge in a dry season, if possible, to
reduce the loss of water and soil. After the construction, the construction unit must
clear up the reminders in case of blocking the river.
6.2.2.9 Cultural Relic Protection
The on-the-spot investigation and the document provided by Luan Cultural Relic
Sector show that there are no cultural relics and historic sites within 200m along the
highway. If any cultural relics are found in the earth, work must be laid aside and the
spot must be protected while reporting to the related sector. Only after the cultural
relics are unearthed, the work can go on by the approval of the cultural relic sector.
6.2.2. 10 Road Signs
By the end of the construction, the construction unit must set up the road signs in line
with the design. There will be 80 milestones and 802 boundary stones along the
highway. Most of all, the sign of no whistling must be placed at the distance of 100m
in the front of schools and hospitals within 200m on both sides of the highway to
reduce the traffic noise. When the highway goes through villages and towns and there
are schools and hospitals on the sides of the highway, signs of speed limit, village,
sidewalk must be set according to the rules to avoid or reduce traffic accidents. The
expense is already included in the construction cost.
6.2.2.11 Greening
As the highway goes through the sensitive sections of villages, towns, schools and
hospitals, 3 rows of arbors and bushes will be added and attentions must be paid to the
selection of tree varieties to lessen the pollution and beautify the environment. The
greening works must be finished together with the main project. About 5300 trees of
arbors and bushes will be cut down when widening the highway, however, 60750
trees (17244 arbors and 43506 bushes) will be planted after rehabilitation. 23.022 X
104m2 of turf will be planted, and the length of 3m-wide green belt will come up to
34



158.26km on either side of the highway.
6.2.2.12 Discharge the Water on the Road
The slopes of the subgrade and side ditches will be improved. The easily-washed
slopes will be laid with bricks or planted with vegetation to protect soil erosion.
6.2.2.13 Environmental Sanitation and Disease Prevention in Campsites
It is essential to pay attention to environmental sanitation and disease prevention. (1)
toilets must be placed; (2) deposit tank must be set up to collect the residential
wastewater; (3) daily garbage must be centralized to fill in spare places; (4) clean
fuels will be used in cooking stoves to decrease the smokes; (5) propaganda column
must be set up to prevent contagious disease, venereal disease (especially AIDS); (6)
the contractor must check the workers' health and send the patients with contagious
disease or AIDS to hospital at once; (7) no drug taking or whoring, if any, the one will
be expelled and sent to public security organs.
6.2.2.14 Set Accusation Signs for Environment Pollution
The construction unit must set up accusation signs for environment pollution in the
sensitive points, with the name of the construction unit, telephone number, the person
in charge and the telephone number for the local EPB to solve the environmental
problems in time if something occurs.
6.2.3 Operation Period
6.2.3.1 Measures to Prevent Traffic Noise
Through the noise forecast in the operation period, after the year 2010, the impact of
traffic noise on the environmental sensitive points outdoors would meet the
requirements of "Urban Areas Environmental Noise Limits" (GB3096-93) Class I,
except the schools and hospital at the distance >SOm to the road center. The rest (at
the distance of <50m from the road center) would exceed the limits to different
degrees byO.5-5.1dB (A) inthe daytime and2.3-7.8dB (A) at night.
In order to lessen the interference of the traffic noise to part of the schools and
hospitals 50m away from the road center, the existing enclosing walls of Nanshan
School, Huangnidian Primary School, Lianhuayan Primary School, Baiyang Primary
School,Shucheng No.3 Middle School, Baoqiao Primary School, Baiyang Hospital
and Hangbu Hospital will be increased from 2m to 3m. Furthermore, the windows and
doors of the classrooms and wards along the highway can be properly shut to reduce
the noise by 10-20dB (A) . By this way, the noise in the classroom and wards can
meet the requirements, kept below 45 dB (A)
6.2.3.2 Maintain Greening and Slopes
In the operation period, close attention must be paid to greening, side ditches and
slope protection to keep the ditches through. If the green belt or the slope have any
damage, new trees will be replanted and the slope will be repaired in time. The green
belt will be cultivated and pruned, and the harmful insects will be killed regularly. It is
necessary to let the residents know the importance of road protection.
35



6.2.3.3 Maintain Road Signs
Various kinds of road signs will be set up by the end of the construction. And the
signs must be immediately changed or replaced if they are damaged or missing in the
operation period.
6.2.3.4 Monitor the tail gas
The highway management sector must cooperate with the local environmental
monitoring station and check the tail gas from the vehicles at a regular time. The
unqualified vehicles are banned to travel on the highway.
6.2.3.5 Manage Environment
The highway squad is directly in charge of maintaining the road pavement, the ditches
and slopes as well. Meanwhile the squad is responsible for repairing the damaged
water conservation and greening. A management plan will be made for the
responsibility in each section so as to keep the highway and environmental protection
in good order.
6.2.3.6 Monitor Environment
In both construction and operation periods, the environmental monitoring plan in the
EIA must be taken into great accounts, moreover, be implemented in accordance with
the requirements.

6.5.2 Environmental benefits
The greening works on the sides of the highway can not only change the scenery,
improve the ecological environment and reduce water lose and soil erosion, but also
decrease the road dust pollution owing to the fallen tree leaves. The environmental
monitoring can find out the degree of noise impact on the sensitive sites so as to take
effective mitigation measures if necessary. Therefore, the greening works and
environmental monitoring are tenefacial for ecological environment and human
health. There are distinct environmental benefits.

3 It is necessary to strengthen the education on "Highway Laws" to raise the puslsc
awareness of takng care of the highway.
The following is the summary of the public opinions:
1. 100% of the participants support the rehabilitation of Luan-Shuchen-Sanhe
section. They think first priority should be given to the construction of road in the
process of becoming rich. To build road would benefit both the county and the
people as well.
2. Participants think that construction of road could promote the traffic conditions,
stimulate the economy, and improve the residents living quality. The respective
percentage is 71%, 22% and 7% respectively
3. 33% and 21% participants think the impact of the road building are traffic noise
and dust. 46% participants think trees should be planted in case that the existing trees
might be cut in the construction of pavement.
4. 40%, 45% and 7% participants think traffic jam, dust and safety of pedestrians
would be the focus people most concern in the construction period. Another 8%
47



participants have not expressed any comments. The focuses that people most care
during the operation period are traffic noise, polluted air and sidewalks. The
corresponding percentage of participants is 70%, 5% and 12%.
7.1.3 Public Opinion and Suggestions
The investigation shows, although some participants think the construction and
operation of the highway might produce negative effects such as traffic noise, dust
and polluted air on the residents, this negative effects would be alleviate by way of
planting trees on both sides of the highway after construction. In a word, the
construction of the project would produce much more positive effects than negative
ones.
Most participants wish the project start the sooner the better so as to let the highway
contribute earlier to society, environment and economy. In addition, it is suggested
that   highway      administration    departments      should    enforce    the    highway
administration,     maintenance and greening as well for the purpose of keeping the
highway in good condition.
To sum up, 100% participants expressed their positive attitude toward the project,
which plays a good foundation for the project. Highway administration departments
and construction units shall fully concern the public opinions and suggestions and try
their efforts to bring the project into full play.

the highway is in full operation after completion of the project until far future (after
cn



2010). As for the environmental sensitive points 50m away from the central line of
the highway, the top noise value of daytime and nighttime is estimated to reach
60. IdB (A) and 52.8 dB (A) respectively. The noise shall impact sensitive points
to some degree. The improvement of the pavement will better the traffic condition and
reduce dust during the operation period and shall not produce negative impacts on
environment air of the residential areas. The green belts of both banks of the highway
shall be the beneficial measures to alleviate the polluted air generated by vehicle and
flying dust.
* Information 4-Alleviation Measures Plan of Environmental Impacts
(1) Designing stage: select proper place for storing building materials and for
mixture, over 200m away from environmental sensitive points: carry out regular
maintenance to noise machines; equip spraying vehicle to control dust; improve
greening belts on both banks; complete road drainage, slope protection and highway
facilities suchas signs of waming, information and highway alignment etc.
(2) construction stage: Building materials for road pavement like asphalt macadam
shall be centralized for mixture and delivered by vehicle to each construction site.
Strong noise machines shall stop working at night in the places where there are
environmental sensitive points. Spraying shall be done in the places with much dust
whenever needed. The planting of green belts of highway shall be finished at the same
time of the completion of major construction work. The temporary wastewater
treatment facilities shall be established for the treatment of centralized residential
wastewater and waste of construction site.
( 3 ) operation stage: Luan Nanshan School, Huangnidian Primary School,
Lianhuayan School, Baiyang Primary School, Shucheng NO. 3 Middle School,
Baoqiao Primary School, Baiyang Hospital and Hangbu Hospital shall promote their
enclosing walls along the highway from existing 2m to 3m.; The environmental
sensitive points with distance 50m away from the highway shall pay proper
attention to the opening time of doors and windows. In addition, three lines of arbor
and bush shall be added in the section near sensitive points for the purpose of
declining noise. The warning indication signs shall be set up in the sensitive places.
Highway Environmental management, environmental supervision institutes and
environmental monitoring report system shall be reinforced. Highway environmental
protection targets and environmental management plan shall be established as well.
* Information 5-Conclusion of Environmental Impact Assessment
The monitoring results of major sensitive points along the highway shows daytime
46.8-54.7dB (A) , and nighttime 35.7-39.8dB (A) basically meet Class I set in
"Environment Noise Standard in Urban Area" (GB3096-93) , which reflects the
quality of environment noise along the highway is good. The monitoring of air
environment shows daily concentration value of pollutant TSP of sensitive points
along the highway is between 0.04-0.1 6mg/m3, and hourly concentration value of
pollutants NO2 and CO is 0.006-0.058mg/m3 and 2.29-5.34mg/m3 respectively.
The daily top value of TSP and hourly top value of NO and CO are both below the
51



limits of Class II set in "Environment Air Quality Standard", which means the quality
of environment air of sensitive points along the highway is good. Concentration value
of COD,r and BOD5 of the major pollutants contained in the water body of Luli river
and Baojia river is below the limit of Class V classified in "Pavement Water
Environment Quality Standard". The water body of major rivers along the highway is
proved good quality.
The noise of construction and dust in the implementation of the project shall produce
certain effect on the sensitive points nearby, but the limited effects shall not last long
Environment pollution shall be controlled by various measures on the construction
site and some action shall be taken to prevent from infectious disease and local
diseases. Simultaneously propaganda and education shall be emphasized.
Although traffic noise and polluted air generated during the operational period shall
cause negative effect on the sensitive points along the highway, such impacts shall be
limited once the alleviation measures are put into practice and green belts on both
banks of the highway are built. Besides, more efforts are needed on the environmental
management and maintenance.
7.2.2 Infonnation Disclosure Channels
For the sake of further collection of comments from the public, the environmental
assessment group sent the printed draft Environmental Assessment Report, results of
public participation and social organization consultation to the cultural activity center
or displayed in the libraries of Luan City, Shucheng County and Qianrenqiao Town.
The display lasted one month from November to December of 2001, which was easy
for public access to the report and supervision and also for the purpose of integrating
public opinions into the Report. Before the display, broadcast regarding the time and
place of the display of the draft EIA was announced three times every day via the
broadcasting stations of Luan City, Shucheng County, Qianrenqiao Town etc.
Information disclosure channels are presented in Table 7-4. The locations of the
information display are identified in the Drawing 7-1.

8. Conclusion
The proposed "rehabilitation" project of Luan-Shucheng-Sanhe section highway is
one of the highway maintenance component of Anhui Province proposed to apply for
the World Bank loan. The total length is 80km. This component is also one of the
highway improvement projects in the 10W five-year plan. This is the action to promote
transportation condition of poor areas in the west of Anhui Province and lay better
foundation for local economic development and flow of goods and people.
The civil works of the project shall implement within the range of existing reserved
subgrade, thus there is no requirement for land acquisition or demolition or
resettlement. According to the investigation and consultation with Luan Municipal
Cultural Relics Administration Sector and Luan Municipal Forestry Bureau, there are
not any special environmental sensitive objects requiring protection along the
highway such as natural protective zones, cultural relics, historic sites, tourist
landscapes, wild animals and plants.
The project implementation has sound social basis and natural environment. The
monitoring results of major sensitive points along the highway show that noise of
daytime and nighttime basically meet Class I set in "Environment Noise
Standard in Urban Area" (GB3096-93) , which reflects the quality of environment
noise along the highway is good. The monitoring of air environment shows the daily
concentration value of TSP and hourly concentration value of NO2 and CO are both
below the limits of Class II set in "Environment Air Quality Standard". Concentration
value of CODC, and BOD5 of the major pollutants contained in the water body of
rivers is below the limit of Class V classified in "Pavement Water Environment
Quality Standard" . Therefore environment quality of water, air and noise are
basically good. The other ecological environment and social environment shall not
produce constraining impacts.
During the implementation, noise and dust generated by the construction shall
produce certain effect on the sensitive points along the highway, but the impacts are
temporary and limited. The environmental action plan describes the measures to
alleviate environmental impacts to the least degree.
Traffic noise and polluted air generated during the operational period shall cause
negative effects on the environmental sensitive points along the highway. The impacts
shall be limited to the least degree once the "three simultaneousness" is put into
practice, highway environmental management, supervision system, environmental
monitoring data management and report procedure shall be reinforced meanwhile.
The total cost of the rehabilitation of Luan-Shucheng-Sanhe section is estimated at
RMB169,866,690 yuan, in addition, the cost of Environment Action Plan is
RMB1,071,400 yuan. The project is planned to start in May 2002, and complete in
April 2004, covering the period of 24 month.
To sum up, this project would produce negative effects on the resident's life, school's
study and hospital's wards. However as long as the mitigation measures proposed in
53



EIA are actually taken, the unfavorable effects will be effectively controlled and
decreased to the lowest degree. Through the comprehensive assessment, the social
benefits and economical benefits are considerable. 100% of the people along the
highway support the project. Therefore this project is feasible in conclusion.
