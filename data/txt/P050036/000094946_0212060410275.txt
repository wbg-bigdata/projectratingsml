1. General Description
1.1 Project Background
1. 1. I Project Source
The proposed S328 Nanzhao-Funan-Yangqiao highway section is one of the
highway maintenance component of Anhui Province applying for the World Bank
loan. This component is selected from more than 400 highway sections totaling
8000km long, based on the comparison conducted by Anhui Provincial
Communications Department of China. The criteria of selection for the highway
maintenance component are: (1) Beneficial to the economic development in the
poverty stricken areas; ( 2 ) Favorable to transportation centralization and
decentralization of the main route (Hefei-Anqing Highway ) ; (3) Fitted for the
provincial 1IOh five-year plan of highway improvement, and priority given to the
sections which have started construction and completed tasks of subgrade widening or
land acquisition under the 9' five year plan so as to improve efficiency of the whole
route and the highway network; (4) The existing road sections cannot meet the
increasing demand for transportation and need rehabilitation. (5) The average
indicators (PQI) of road pavement quality are low and pavement is poor.
S328 Nanzhao-Funan-Yangqiao section is located on the north of Huai River of
Anhui Province where the major transportation relies only on road for there is no
railway to reach these areas. Therefore the improvement of road pavement and the
increase of the communication capacity directly relate with the local economic
development and people's living quality. As the economy develops and the
transportation increases, the existing road with low grade, narrow pavement and poor
quality cannot mect the demands of economic development and transportation. Thus,
Anhui Provincial Communications Department is applying for the World Bank loan
(remaining volume) to support the rehabilitation of S328 Nanzhao-Funan-
Yangqiao highway section for the sake of improving local condition of transportation
to the outside. stimulating local economic development and bettering the people's life.
According to the requirement of Anhui Provincial Communications Department of
China, in July 2001, Anhui Provincial Highway Administration Bureau entrusted the
job to Hefei Design & Research Institute, Ministry of Coal Industry, of environmental
assessment and preparation of the environmental impact assessment on S328
Nanzhao-Funan- Yangqiao section of highway maintenance.
1.1.2 Status of Environmental Assessment
The assessment unit, after accepting the entrustment, set up an environmental
assessment group in July 2001. The group together with Anhui Provincial Highway
Administration Bureau and Anhui Provincial Highway Survey and Design Institute
carried out field visits and public participation and consultation along S328
Nanzhao--Funan- Yangqiao highway section. The group conducted deep field
investigation relatingts environmental status and environmental protective targets
along the section. Based on the site visits, data collection and further study of the
I



project feasibility study report and under the direction and assistance of the
environmental experts of the World Bank, the group worked out the draft
"Environmental Impact Report of S328 Nanzhao-Funan-Yangqiao section of
Highway Maintenance Component of the World Bank- financed Anhui Provincial
Highway Project of China". Now the report is submitted to the World Bank for
review.
1.2 Aim of the Environmental Assessment
The report shall make qualitative or quantitative anticipation analysis and assessment
on the possible environmental impacts caused by the project construction, on the base
of the investigation into the natural and social environment and environment quality
within the assessment scope of S328 Nanzhao-Funan-Yangqiao section, and
combined with the understanding of the environmental status and relative
environmental issues along the section. The report shall point out the potential
problems and propose effective and reasonable alleviating measure correspondingly.
The alleviating measures shall be put into practice to reduce the environmental impact
during the project construction and operation to the lowest degree. The following
targets shall be reached as well.
(1) Provide basis for the decision making relating the project, fairly and
objectively identify and describe possible environmental impacts during the
construction as well as the impacted scope and degree, so as to assure the
rationality and appropriation of the construction and operation of the project.
(2) Investigation result shall be presented in the report based on the understanding
towards the public opinions via the investigation along the section.
(3) Various measures of prevention; alleviation and reduction to the lowest degree
of the negative impacts shall be proposed, established on the result of
environmental impact anticipation and applicable compensation methods shall
be proposed as well. The aim is to identify negative impact before the
construction, raise attention in finalizing the design document and bid contract,
and carry out the alleviation methods during the construction period.
(4) The environmental assessment shall work as decision making reference,
provided to the highway administration Bureaus and local government
institutions along the section in making environmental administration plan and
environmental development programs.

2.6 Project Directly Impacted Areas
According to the investigation, the affected towns are identified as follows. Nanzhao
Town, Huatuomiao Town, Huanggang Town, Miaoji Town, northern district of Funan
County, Zhaoji Town, Huilong Town, Lvzhai Town, Huaji Town, Laoji Town, Fanji
Town and Yangqiao Town etc. There are 12 towns and districts in total.
2.7 Sources of Building Materials
The "rehabilitation" construction does not require a big quantity of earthworks. The
major works shall be the pavement widening and intensification. Major materials shall
be rubble, macadam, sand, lime, asphalt, cement and so on. All these materials shall
be procured from markets.
Except for that sand to be procured from Huaibin County Sand Pit of Henan Province,
macadam, lime, cement shall be procured from Fengtai Stone Pit, Fengtai Lime Pit,
and Fengtai Cement Plant etc. Asphalt oil shall be obtained from Wuhu Huanyu
Asphalt Material Company. According to "Environmental Protection Law of the
People's Republic of China", building materials such as stones, sand should be
provided by those who have the mining licenses. The environment issues produced by
the sand pits and stone pits are the business of the owners who is responsible for the
rehabilitation of its ecological environment in consistence with the relative 19th
regulation set in the above law. The Law stipulates "excavating natural resources
should be taken with measures of protecting ecological environment". Thus the
project would not consider the environmental problems caused by sources of the
materials of sand and stone pits. Table 2-2 shows the sources of the major materials
and ways of transportation.

activities is very long and there is not any large-sized wild animals or large-belt
natural vegetation. There is few rare wild animals or vegetation to be protected in this
place. The man-planted vegetation and small wild animals could be seen within 200 m
away from the highway, including forestry in the mounds, green belts on both sides of
the highway, farming crops in the fields and various small wild animals as frogs,
snakes and insects as well.
3.2.2 Agricultural Ecological Environment
The region is Huaibei cultivated area. The main crops along the section are wheat,
bean, kaoliang, corn, sweet potato, oil crop, peanuts and sesame and also fruit and
melon. National economic statistics of 2000 says that the farming land in Fuyang City,
Funan County and Linquan County volumes to 642,000 ha/a.
The people living along the route raise livestock and fowls, including chicken, ducks
and geese, pigs, cattle, sheep etc.
The trees along the road are man-planted as poplar, platen and paulownia. There are
some trees of pear, peach and apple too. The land for forestry of Fuyang City, Funan
County and Linquan County volumes to 1190 ha, shown in the national economic
statistics of 2000.

The environment noise of daytime 46.8-54.7dB (A), nighttime 35.1 -40.2dB (A)
presented in the Table 4-1, basically meets the limit of Class I stipulated in
"Environmental Noise Standard in Urban Areas" (GB3096-93) . The quality of
environment noise of major environmental sensitive points along the highway is
good.

Table 4-3 presents that concentration value of CODCr and BODs of the major
pollutants contained in the water body of the rivers is below the limit of Class V
classified in "Pavement Water Environment Quality Standard". The water body of
major rivers along the highway is proved good quality.
4.2 Investigation into Industrial Pollution Generators
According to the investigation into industrial pollution generators, there are not any
large sized constant industrial pollution generators along the highway, except for
some township agricultural side products processing plants (small-sized) and social
service sectors. Due to the poor pavement of the highway, much instant TSP is
produced when vehicle passes by. This affects air environment of the highway to
some degree but the impact is limited. Meanwhile, air whistle loud speakers ane used
frequently so that noise dB exceeds the limit instantly.
4.3 Special Environment Investigation
According to the investigation along the highway and consultation with Fuyang
Municipal Cultural Relics Administration Office and Fuyang Municipal Forestry
Bureau, there are not any natural protective zones, cultural relics, historic sites and
wild animals and plants which need protection, within 200m away from the central
line of the highway. Further investigation shows there is not any natural protective
zone within 20km away from the highway either. However, in case any buried ancient
graves or historic ruins are discovered, the contractor shall have to report to local
cultural relics and historical site administration Bureaus. The contractor shall not go
on constructing until relative Bureaus complete concemed work.
The evidential documents of the investigation provided by relative units are attached
to the report

5. Forecast and Evaluation of Potential Environmental Impact
5.1 Construction Period
The road pavement "rehabilitation" of S328 Nanzhao-Funan-Yangqiao section
covers a whole length of 94.73km. The existing width of the subgrade is 16-22m
and the width of the pavement is 6.0-9.0m. It is designed to widen the road
pavement to 12.0 m with asphalt macadam on the basis of the existing subgrade
during the construction period. Therefore, this construction period does not involve
land acquisition or resettlement, excavation or fill. The negative impacts of the
construction on the nearby environment would cover the following aspects:
5.1.1 Impact on Acoustic Environment Quality
(1) Noise from the machinery in the construction period
During the construction of this project, various machines and vehicles would be used
and the tested noise values are showed in Table 5-1. The main machinery contains
shovel loaders, road rollers, paver buckets and dumpers that would make unavoidable
noise during the construction. The transportation of construction materials like
cobblestones, sand, cement, asphalt oil and etc. would increase the traffic volume and
affect a larger scope. As the mixing process of asphalt macadam would be done in the
station, the transportation of pavement materials would cause traffic noise increasing.
Nevertheless, the adding value of traffic noise is rather small compared to the existing
traffic volume.

Note. the construction machinery and the notse values are adopted from "Standards for Envtronmental
Impact Evaluation in Highway Construction (Trial Implementation)" (ITJO05-96)
Most of the section passes through open fields and just a few passes through towns
and villages. During the implementation of the project, the noise of construction and
traffic would affect the quality of the residents' life on both sides of the road.
Occasionally the noise in the daytime might slightly surpass the limit [ >55dB (A) ].
The investigation shows that the construction of S328 Nanzhao-Funan-Yangqiao
section comes across 21 middle or primary schools and hospitals within 200m on both
sides of the highway. The details are presented in the following Table 5-2.
Because the sensitive points of schools and hospitals on either side of the road lie at
the distance of 30-170m from the road, the noise of construction and traffic might
generate noise impact on the classrooms of schools and the wards of hospitals.

Attenuation type of point sound source would be applied considering the types of
machines and their noise. Vehicles for transportation would be regarded as sound
source in the construction. The following Table 5-3 is the estimate of noise level
generated by main machines and vehicles to different distances during the
construction.

"Noise Limits of Construction Site" (GB12523-90) stipulates: noise of construction
site is limited to 70-75dB (A) in the daytime and 55dB (A) at night. Table 5-3
shows that impacted distance by the noise of machinery is within 50m in the daytime
and the distance beyond 50m meets the regulated noise limit. At night, the distance
beyond 300m can basically meet the noise limit.
According to the investigation, within the distance of 50m on either side of S328
Nanzhao-Funan-Yangqiao section, the sensitive points of noise are only Tianguai
Dongliang Middle School and Shenqiao Primary School. Thus, the noise of
construction (mainly the noise from the wheel shovel loader) in the daytime might
generate little impact on the schools and hospitals, except the above-mentioned two
schools. But strong noise of machines and operations is forbidden at night.
(2) Noise from the asphalt mixing station
The asphalt mixing station will be set up at the maintenance squad during the
construction. On the investigation of the site, there are no environmental sensitive
points (such as schools, residential areas, sanatoriums or hotels) to be protected within
200m. Based on the analogy monitoring to the asphalt mixing station by Hefei
Environmental Monitoring Station, the actual tested noise values are shown in Table
54.
The actual tested values show the noises of the asphalt mixing station ( the machine is
about 40m away from the site boundaries) are 53.4-54.6dB (A) in the daytime and
41.9-44.8dB (A) at night at the places L.Om from the boundaries. So the noise
values in the daytime and at night are both lower than the "Noise Limits for Site
Boundary of Industrial Enterprises" (GB 12348-90) Class I.

standards
By the analogy monitoring, the noise of the asphalt mixing station can meet the
requirements of "Urban Areas Environment Noise Limits" Class I. Therefore, it is
believed in the evaluation that the noise will not affect the environment and people
nearby.
5.1.2 Impact on Environment Air Quality
The major impacts in the construction period are identified as the flying dust caused
by the transportation of the materials, the exposed wind-eroded road pavement and
the NO2 and CO by vehicles. These have some impacts on the air environment on
either side of the highway.
(1) Road dust
During the construction period, the increasing volume of vehicles increase the flying
dust. According to the monitoring to the Beijing-Tianjing-Tangshan Highway in the
construction period by the Highway Institute of MOC, the TSP density was 5.093 at
the distance 150m leeward, exceeding the "Environment Air Quality Limits "
(GB3095-1996) Class IL However, the necessary watering will reduce the flying
duct at least 70%. The analogy monitoring on the flying dust in the similar condition
is shown in Table 5-5.
TSP of the Construction Road
Table 5-5
Distance to the road (m)         0         20         30         100        200

24



The table shows that the necessary watering will reduce the flying duct 50%-80%
during the construction. The impact on air environment will be distinctly decreased.
(2) Tail gas
As the transportation increases, the N02 and CO in the tail gas by vehicles increase as
well. The analogy monitoring conducted within the distance of 30m on either side of
the road shows that the average density per hour of NO2 and CO is 0.037-0.066
mg/m3 and 0.95-1.65 mg/rn3, which meet the limits in "Environment Air Quality
Limits" (GB3095-1996) Class II. Therefore, it can be said that the NO2 and CO in
the tail gas by the increasing vehicles will not affect the air environment on either side
of the road.
(3) Asphalt lampblack
In this project, the asphalt macadam used to pave the road pavement needs heating.
When heated and paved, asphalt lampblack is created and affects the air environment.
The major pollutants are THC, TSP, BaP and etc., in which BaP is poisonous. In the
relevant documents, the closed decocting technology will keep the density of BaP less
than S0.0001 I' g/m3 at the distance 50m leeward, lower than the standard value 0.03
i. g/m3 in the "Environment Air Quality Limits"  (GB3095-1996) Class II. The
density of THC at the distance 60m leeward is <0. 16 mg/m3 (At present, there are
no air environment limits and discharge standards set for THC in China) the
construction materials will be mixed in the station, and the station is kept 200m away
from the sensitive points and residential areas. Therefore, the asphalt lampblack will
not affect the air environment.
(4) Construction campsite
The main pollutants in the construction campsite are TSP and SO2 from the cooking
stoves. As the campsite is set at the distance 200m leeward away from the
environmental sensitive points, moreover, the discharge is at intervals and limited, the
impact on the air environment is slight.
5.1.3 Impact on Ecological Environment
In case of the implementation of the project to widen and reinforce shoulders of the
existing road into road pavement, there would be little impact on the ecological
environment. Some weeds on the shoulders and part of bush vegetation would be cut
and destroyed. Around 9000 trees in the investigation might be cut in the course of
widening the road. There is not any grassland or woods along the road. Since no land
acquisition occurs, the farmland on either side of the road would remain the same as
before. The vegetation beyond the both banks of the road would be protected through
stressing the environmental ideas among the workers to reduce the impact to the
lowest degree.
In addition, some TSP pollutants would be generated due to the mixing of pavement
materials during the construction and would land on the vegetation and leaves of
crops, as a result, the photosynthesis and the unit yield will be affected. The
stimulated test of dust proves that the impact is slight. In addition, the TSP landed on
25



leaves would be rushed away with the rainwater and would not stay long, the impact
on the growth of plants is negligible.
5.1.4 Impact on the Pavement Water
During the construction period, the impacts on the water environment involve in the
following aspects: the watering when rolling the road the wastewater of washing
machinery and the residential wastewater in the construction campsite.
(1) Watering in the construction
During the works of rehabilitation of pavement, water content would be kept for
pavement reinforcement in the rolling to reach the required degree of enforcement.
Limited water would be used for the mixing of reinforcing materials and rolling. The
water would be absorbed by materials of pavement and leave little water into the side
ditches and farming land. Consequently there is no impact on water environment.
(2) Wastewater of washing machinery and dropped machine oil in maintenance
When the machinery needs repairing and washing in a rainy day, the water used is just
a little. Generally it can go directly into the ground, with little impact on the pavement
water.
There is no maintenance station in the construction, and all the repair work is done at
the maintenance shops in the city or county. As result, no dropped machine oil in the
construction site will affect the pavement water.
(3) Residential wastewater in the construction campsite
There are 3 contract sections in this project, and each has set upl campsite, so there
are 3 campsites. On the basis of the existing construction rules, each section has about
40 workers. The water used is limited, for there is no bathroom in the campsite and
the toilet without water (dry toilet). The maximum water used is about 60 I/p/d, that is,
the water consumption in each campsite comes up to 2.4m3/d and the wastewater is
about 2.0m3/d. The wastewater mainly contains BOD5, CODCr and oil. Therefore, the
residential wastewater has a little impact on the pavement water. As long as necessary
measures are taken, the impact on water environment can be lessened.
(4) Residential garbage in the construction campsite
The residential garbage of the workers is rather little. It volumes to about 20kg in each
campsite in term of 0.5kg/p/d. It is collected in a garbage bin, and then carried to the
treatment stations in the nearby city or county. Therefore, the residential garbage will
not affect the pavement water.
5.1.5 Impact on the Irrigation System
During the works of rehabilitation of road pavement, the road will pass through some
of the irrigation system in the farmland. Attention will be paid not to block the ditches,
canals or culvert with the construction materials so as to let the water through. So the
construction will have no impact on the water environment and the irrigation system.
5.1.6 Impact on Traffic in the Bridge Construction
26



The major rivers passed by this project are Taozi River, Jienan River and etc. they are
all seasoning rivers and the width of the rivers are 10- 15m or so in winter. Along
The whole road, I extremely large bridge with a length of 160.04m, 2 medium
bridges with a length of 153.53m and II small bridges with a length of 251.3m will
be built. The vehicles and people can pass through the existing bridges in the
construction. So the bridge construction will not affect traffic. It has been considered
in the design that the vehicles and people can go by a temporary path while small
bridges are under construction. There will be some impacts, but very little.
In addition, the structure of the bridge base will be enlarged by stone concrete, a small
part of it will be piles. Consequently attention must be paid not to drop the materials
into the river when pouring the concrete, avoiding polluting the river water and the
farmland. In building extremely large and large bridge, as the steel concrete grouting
is designed for the lower structure of the bridge, it would flow into the river and
pollute the water or farmland if the sludge in the base drilling is not reused or
enclosed with cofferdam.
5.1.7 Impact on Soil and Water Conservation
This project lies in the plain and there is no slope. Furthermore, as the widening of the
road is based on the existing subgrade, there is little excavation and fill. So the
affected area is small, and the soil erosion caused by loss of soil and water in the
construction is not serious. According to the documents provided by Fuyang Irrigation
Bureau, it belongs to a preventive area with light erosion. In terms of the soil erosion
modulus in this area 1800-2000tlkm2/a, the total volume of soil and water erosion
will volume to 2540-2820t in this construction.
5.1.8 Traffic Environment and Others
In order to keep the traffic open during the construction, half of the road or the two
halves in tum is under construction which might inevitably cause jam and affect
traffic environment to some degree. However the negative effect is only temporary.
In addition, certain impact would be generated by busy traffic of transportation on the
construction site and would certainly bring inconvenience to the production activities,
travel, living and rest of the residents along the road. But the impact is limited and
could be acceptable.
To sum up, the main potential impacts of this project during the construction period
would be the impact of traffic noise, the TSP pollutants in the construction and the
pollutants in the campsite.
5.2 Operation Period
5.2.1 Impact from Traffic Noise
This project will come into the operation period once the project is completed. As the
traffic condition is improved, the yearly traffic volume of various vehicles will
increase. The traffic volume would increase from the average 1030 no./d in the year
of 2001 to 1868 no./d in the year of 2010. The traffic volume would increase from the
27



average 2431 no./d in the year of 2015 to 3806 no./d in the year of 2025. This shows
the noise impact of traffic would rise due to the traffic volume grows and the high
speed of vehicles.
18 primary and middle schools and 3 clinics are located within 200m away from the
road. All of these schools and hospitals have enclosing walls which are 30-170 m
away directly from the road. Traffic noise declines at a geometrical level, and the
impact varies with the transmission distance to the classrooms or the wards. Estimate
of environmental sensitive points of traffic noise in S328 Nanzhao-Funan-
Yangqiao section is presented in the Table 5-6.

The estimate shows that, in the year 2005, the impact of traffic noise mainly on
Tianguai Donliang Middle School and Shenqiao Primary School outdoors exceed the
limits by 0.4-2.4dB (A) in the daytime and 2.5-5.0dB (A) at night. After the year
20 10, as the traffic volume increases, the impact of traffic noise on the environmental
sensitive points at the distance of (50m outdoors would exceed the requirements of
"Urban Areas Environment Noise Limits"  (GB3096-93) Class 1 by 1.2-2.9dB
(A) in the daytime and 1.5-5.5dB (A) at night. The maximum exceeding value in
the daytime and at night (year 2010) will be outside the classroom of Tianguai
Dongliang Middle School, for it is closer to the road in distance. The forecast of the
rest is lower than the limits of Class I both in the daytime and at night.
Therefore, the increase of the enclosure of the schools and hospitals, the properly
shut-down of windows and doors of the classrooms and wards along the highway and
the addition of green belt can separate or decrease the noise from the traffic.
5.2.2 Impact on Environment Air
During the operation of the project, the increasing emission of NO2 and CO would
grow on environment air quality along the road corresponding to the rise of traffic
flow by years. The forecast of the traffic volume in the operation period would be
average 1868 no./d in the year of 2010 and 3096 no./d in the year of 2020. Table 5-7
shows the forecast of NO2 and CO in the tail gas.

I NO,    0.0052   0.0012   0 0003   0.004    0.0019  I0 0005
The forecast shows that, as the traffic volume increase in the operation penod, the
forecasted density of NO2 and CO emitted by vehicles under different conditions is
lower than the limits in the (GB3095-1996) Class II. Moreover, The design of green
trees on both sides can make full use of the green belt to absorb the air pollutants. And
this is beneficial for air diffusion. Consequently the emission of NO2 and CO
generated by vehicles would slightly affect the air environment.
During the operation period, the traffic condition of the road would be improved
greatly. And the TSP produced by vehicles would decrease correspondingly compared
with the existing road. The impact of TSP to the sensitive points would decline as
well.
29



In conclusion, it is considered in this evaluation that the potential environmental
impacts of this project are traffic noise and the tail gas.
5.3 Other Environmental Problems
On the basis of the features of this "rehabilitation" project and the description of
environment, the evaluation group thinks that the suggested project involves no
sensitive areas, therefore, the impacts on the following environmental problems are
tiny or can be neglected:
(1) There is slight impact on wild animals, for there are no species of wild
animals.
(2) There are no natural protection areas, scenic spots, cultural relics and historic
sites along the road.
(3) The "rehabilitation" project will not fetch or discard the earth, so there are no
ecological problems.
(4) This project involves no land acquisition or resettlement.

6.2 Possible Environmental Impact Compensation Measures
6.2.1 Design Period
6.2.1.1 Set the Site for Building Materials and Mixing Station
This project is a rehabilitation project of widening and strengthening on the basis of
the existing highways. On the analysis of the potential environmental impact factors,
the stacking sites for the building materials such as cobblestones, sand and lime,
carried from outside should be kept far away from schools, hospitals, residential areas,
towns and streets beyond 200m leeward when designed.
The site for the mixing station is selected at Shuangbei, 200m north suburb of Funan,
without environmental sensitive points or residential areas. The mixer is made in
Qianzhou, Fujian Province, equipped with dust-provertion apparatus. The asphalt will
be melted in an oil tank with a volume of 200t and a hot-oil conducting device. This
kind of mixer can effectively stop producing asphalt lampblack and reduce the flying
powder.
6.2.1.2 Dig Side Ditches and Build Road Slopes
In the design, side ditches and culverts along the road will be improved, and the
slopes of the subgrade will be built with bricks and vegetation.
32



6.2.1.3 Water to Reduce the Road Dust
In the material mixing and the construction procedure, watering equipment must be
designed in order to water the easily-dusting materials and decrease the dust. In the
dry weather, it is necessary to water 4 times to reduce the dust pollution to the nearby
environment.
6.2.1.4 Greening
In the design, a whole length of 188.32km green belt and outside the road shoulder on
both sides of the highway and the slope protection works have been taken into
account to protect the slope and lighten the loss of water and soil. The varieties of
vegetation should be properly selected in the natural conditions.
6.2.1.5 Safety Signs
245 signs and warning posts have been designed in the crosses, sensitive points, main
crosswalks and etc.
6.2.2 Construction Period
The potential environmental impacts in the construction period include in the traffic
noise and road dust. The following mitigation measures are suggested:
6.2.2.1 Select a Site for the Asphalt Macadam Mixing Station
The mixing station will be set up at Shuangbei, 200m north suburb of Funan. Central
yard mix is used and the mixed materials will be carried by trucks to each section for
pavement so as to reduce the noise radiation to the residents especially to the schools
and hospitals along the highway. If road mix is used in the building material "three-
mixed" within 200m away from the sensitive points, night work (22:00-6:00 at night)
would be forbidden so as not to affect the study, living and rest of the students,
patients and residents.
6.2.2.2 Control the Construction Dust
In the construction period, it is necessary to water the easily-dusting sections and
materials in a fixed time, especially in the sections passing through villages and towns,
4 times/day according to the design, in order to reduce the dust pollution to the nearby
environment.
6.2.2.3 Store Bulk Materials and Prevent Dust
Bulk materials must be stored 200m away from the sensitive sites of schools,
hospitals, towns and villages. In dry days with strong wind, the easily-dusting bulk
materials must be covered by canvas or plastic cloth to prevent the air pollution in the
construction sections.
6.2.2.4 Treat Wastes
Owing to all the building materials carried from outside, there are few wastes. If any,
the action of central disposition in each section will be taken to conserve the water
and soil.
33



6.2.2.5 Protect Crops
The contractor has the responsibility to tell the staff and workers to pay attention to
protecting the fields and crops along construction sections and not to destroy the
farmland, so as to decrease the damage to the crops.
6.2.2.6 Ensure Traffic Order
The half-side pavement will be used in the rehabilitation project, thus traffic block
will not be avoided. In the construction sections, warning signs or detour signs must
be put to ensure the project quality and keep the traffic in good order. There must be
assigned persons in charge of conducting the traffic.
6.2.2.7 Water and Soil Conservation
When working with the fill or excavation, the exposed slopes must be done with
vegetation. Some slopes and side ditches must be built up with bricks or stones, as
designed, to stop the water and soil being washed away in the operation period.
6.2.2.8 Prevention Measures in Bridge Construction
It is suggested in the bridge construction that the surplus earth be used to strengthen
the embankment of the river to reduce the block of river course and loss of water and
soil. Moreover, it would be better to build the bridge in a dry season, if possible, to
reduce the loss of water and soil. In addition, drilling cofferdam and deposit tank for
sludge must be set up so that the sludge cannot flow into the river and affect the
growth of crops. After the construction, the construction unit must clear up the
remainders and not discard the remainders in case of blocking the river.
6.2.2.9 Greening
A length of 188.32km green belt on both sides of the road will be finished during the
construction period, and 47188 trees will be planted after construction. 3 rows of
arbors and bushes will be added in the sensitive sections of schools and hospitals.
Attentions must be paid to the selection of tree varieties to lessen the pollution and
beautify the environment. The greening works must be finished together with the
main project.
6.2.2.10 Discharge the Water on the Road and Protect the Slopes
The slopes of the subgrade and side ditches will be improved. And trough for rush
water will be set up in the easily-washed slopes. The slopes will be laid with bricks or
planted with vegetation to protect soil erosion.
6.2.2.11 Road Signs
By the end of the construction, the construction unit must, in line with the design, set
up the road signs of crosswalk, warning, village and so on at the distance of I 00m in
the front of schools, hospitals and towns to reduce traffic accidents.
6.2.2.12 Cultural Relic Protection
If any ancient tombs or cultural relics are found in the earth, the contractor must
report to the related sector at once. Only after the cultural relics are unearthed, the
34



work can go on by the approval of the cultural relic sector.
6.2.2.13 Environmental Sanitation and Disease Prevention in Campsites
It is essential for the contractor to pay attention to the living environment, treating the
residential wastewater in the temporary septic, collecting daily garbage in a bin and
carrying out to fill.
The cooking stoves will use clean fuels to decrease the smokes that will be discharged
into the air environment.
The contractor will be responsible for the workers' health and prevent local,
contagious diseases, AIDS and etc.
The contractor must check the workers' health. If patients with contagious diseases or
AIDS are found out, they must be sent to hospital at once or separate for treatment.
Drug taking and whoring are banned, if any, the one will be expelled and sent to
public security organs.
6.2.2.14 Set Accusation Signs for Environment Pollution
The construction unit must set up accusation signs for environment pollution in the
sensitive points, with the name of the construction unit, telephone number, the person
in charge and the telephone number for the local EPB to solve the environmental
problems in time if something occurs.
6.2.3 Operation Period
6.2.3.1 Measures to Prevent Traffic Noise
The forecast in the operation period, after the year 2010, the impact of traffic noise on
the environmental sensitive points outdoors would basically meet the requirements of
"Urban Areas Environment Noise Limits" (GB3096-93) Class 1, except Qinghe
Primary School, Huanggang Junior Middle School, Huanggang Primary School,
Zhanggucun Primary School, Liuzhai Junior Middle School, Jizhuang Primary School,
Chengjiaxiang Middle School, Zhaoji Middle School, Lvzhai Middle School, Huajie
Primary School. The environment noise in the rest schools and hospitals outdoors
would exceed the limits by 1.2-2.9dB(A)in the daytime and I .5-5.5dB(A)at night.
It is suggested in this evaluation to increase the existing enclosures of Tianguai
Dongliang Middle School (40m) and Shenqiao Primary School (30m) from 2m to 3m.
Furthermore, the windows and doors of the classrooms and wards along the highway
can be properly shut to keep the noise below 45 dB (A) . In addition, 3 rows of arbors
and bushes will be added on either side of the road to decline the noise impact on the
schools and hospitals.
6.2.3.2 Plan the Buildings on Each Side
During the operation period, It is suggested that no residential area (Class II) within
I OOm and no schools, hospitals or sanatoriums (Class I) within 200m be set up on
either side of the highway in the local plan.
6.2.3.3 Maintain Greening and Slopes
35



As the highway goes through the sensitive points of schools and hospitals, attentions
must be paid to the selection of tree varieties and the arrangement of higher or lower
trees to lessen the pollution and beautify the environment. Responsibility must be set
up in each section and let the residents know the importance of road protection.
6.2.3.4 Maintain Road Signs
Various kinds of road signs will be set up by the end of the construction. And the
signs must be immediately changed or replaced if they are damaged or missed in the
operation period.
6.2.3.5 Manage Environment
The highway squad is directly in charge of maintaining the road pavement, the ditches
and slopes as well. Meanwhile the squad is responsible for repairing the damaged
water conservation and greening. A management plan will be made for the
responsibility in each section so as to keep the highway and environmental protection
in good order.
6.2.3.6 Monitor Environment
The highway management sector must cooperate with the local environmental
monitoring station and check the tail gas from the vehicles at a regular time. The
unqualified vehicles are banned to travel on the highway.
In both construction and operation periods, the environmental monitoring plan in the
EIA must be taken into great accounts, moreover, be implemented in accordance with
the requirements.

held to promote staff's awareness of environmental protection. During the
implementation, another training would be held on environment law and regulations
combining with the practice. Anhui Provincial Communications Department is
responsible for the training. The training is planned to be in mid-May of 2002 and
(before the implementation) and May of 2003 respectively. The training would need 2
days for each in the home country. The attendants would come from the city and
county highway administration bureaus and their branches, construction units and
supervision units. The training is designed to cover environmental protection laws,
regulations and environment standard and related environmental protection
knowledge. By way of training, attendants would understand the potential
environmental problems during the implementation of the project, the importance of
ecological environmental protection and possible measures to alleviate and prevent
the pollution, promote their awareness of environmental protection. The sense of
environmental protection would penetrate into all the staff in the work. Table 6-7
shows the training plan.

The greening works on the sides of the highway can not only change the scenery,
improve the ecological environment and reduce water lose and soil erosion, but also
decrease the road dust pollution owing to the fallen tree leaves. The environmental
monitoring can find out the degree of noise impact on the sensitive sites so as to take
effective mitigation measures if necessary. Therefore, the greening works and
environmental monitoring are benefacial for ecological environment and human
health. There are distinct environmental benefits.

3. It is necessary to strengthen the education on "Highway Laws" to raise public
awareness of taking care of the highway.
The following is the summary of the public opinions:
1.  100%   of the participants support the rehabilitation of S328 Nanzhao-Shuchen-
Yangqiao section. They think first priority should be given to the construction of road
in the process of becoming rich. To build road would benefit both the country and the
people as well.
2. Participants think that construction of road could promote the traffic conditions,
stimulate the economy, and improve the residents living quality. The percentage is
74%, 23% and 3% respectively.
3. 54% and 12% participants think the impacts of the road building are traffic noise
and dust. 34% participants think trees should be planted in case that the existing trees
might be cut in the construction of road pavement.
4. 28%, 49% and 12% parttcipants think traffic jam, dust and safety of pedestrians
48



would be the focus people most concern in the construction period. Another 11%
participants have not expressed any comments. The focues that people most care
during the operation period are traffic noise, polluted tail air and sidewalks. The
corresponding percentage of participants is 85%, 8% and 4%. In addition, 3% of
participants think it is necessary to strengthen the administration of highway
operation.
5. 80% participants expressed their concern for highway facilities and greening.
7.1.3 Public Opinion and Suggestions
The investigation shows, although some participants think the construction and
operation of the highway might produce negative effects such as traffic noise, dust
and polluted air on the, residents, this negative effect would be alleviated by means of
planting trees on both sides of the highway after construction. In a word, the
construction of the project would produce much more positive effect than negative
ones.
Most participants wish the project start the sooner the better so as to let the highway
contribute earlier to society, environment and economy. In addition, it is suggested
that highway administration departments should enforce the highway management,
maintenance and greening as well for the purpose of keeping the highway in good
condition.
To sum up, 100% participants expressed their positive attitude toward the project,
which plays a good foundation for the project. Highway administration departments
and construction units shall fully concern the public opinions and suggestions and try
their efforts to bring the project into full play.

Plan is RMB1,465,100 yuan. The project is planned to start in May 2002, and
complete in April 2004, covering the period of 24 months.
* Information 3- potential environmental impact of the project
(I ) The noise and dust during the construction shall have negative effects on the
sensitive points along the highway. The construction shall bring inconvenience to the
nearby residents in their daily life. The residential waste and wastewater of the
construction sites shall affect environment. However the construction shall not affect
the rivers and irrigation system of farming land.
(2) The noise along the highway shall increase as the traffic volume increases once
the highway is in full operation after completion of the project. In the far future (after
2010), as for the sensitive points, the top noise value of daytime is estimated at 57.9
dB (A) , exceeding the limit of Class I by 2.9dB (A), set out in "Environment Noise
Standard in Urban Areas" (GB3096-93) and the top noise value of nighttime is
estimated to reach 50.5dB (A) , exceeding the limit by 5.5dB (A).  The noise shall
affect sensitive points to some degree. The improvement of the pavement will better
the traffic condition and reduce dust during the operation period and shall not produce
negative impact on environment air of the residential areas.
* Information 4-Alleviation Plan of Environmental Impact
(1 ) Designing stage: select proper place for storing building materials and for
mixture, over 200m away from sensitive points: carry out regular maintenance to
noise machines; equip spraying vehicle to control dust; improve greening belts on
both banks to alleviate the impact of tail air and dust; complete road drainage, slope
protection and highway facilities such as signs of warning, indication and highway
alignment etc.
(2) construction stage: Building materials for road pavement like asphalt macadam
shall be centralized for mixture and delivered by vehicle to each construction site.
Strong noise machines shall stop working at night in the places of sensitive points.
Spraying shall be done in the places with much dust whenever needed. The planting
of green belts of highway shall be finished at the same time of the completion of
52



major construction work. The temporary wastewater treatment facilities shall be
established for the treatment of centralized residential wastewater and waste of the
construction site.
(3) operation stage: Waming signs shall be set up at the place near the sensitive
points. On the other hand, those sensitive points, such as Tianguailiandong Middle
chool and Shengqiao Primary School, at the distance 5Om away from the highway
shall promote their enclosing walls from existing 2m to 3m and pay proper attention
to the opening time of doors and windows. In addition, three lines of arbors and
bushes shall be added in the section near sensitive points. Highway environmental
management, environmental supervision institutes and environmental monitoring
report system shall be reinforced. Highway environmental protection targets and
environmental management plan shall be established as well.
- Information 5-Conclusion of Environmental Impact Assessment
The monitoring results of major sensitive points along the highway shows daytime
46.8-54.7dB (A) and nighttime 35.1-40.2dB (A) basically meet Class I set in
"Environment Noise Standard in Urban Areas" (GB309693) , which reflects the
quality of environment noise along the highway is good. The daily top value of TSP
and hourly top value of NO2 and CO are both below the limits of Class II set in
"Environment Air Quality Standard" (GB3095-1996), which means the quality of
environment air of sensitive points along the highway is good. Concentration value of
CODC, and BODs of the major pollutants contained in the water body of rivers is
below the limit of Class V classified in "Pavement Water Environment Quality
Standard" (GHZB-1999). The pavement water environment along the highway is
proved good quality.
The noise of construction and dust in the implementation of the project shall produce
certain effect on the sensitive points nearby, but the limited effects shall not last long
Environment pollution on the construction site shall be controlled by various
measures such as temporary facilities of treatment and some action to be taken to
prevent infectious disease, local disease and AIDS. Simultaneously propaganda and
education shall be emphasized.
Although traffic noise and polluted air generated during the operational period shall
cause negative effects on the sensitive points along the highway,such impacts shall be
limited once the alleviation measures are put into practice and green belts on both
sides of the highway are built. Besides, more efforts have to be made on the
environmental management and maintenance.

8. Conclusion
The proposed "rehabilitation" construction of S328 Nanzhao-Funan-Yangqiao
highway section is one of the highway maintenance component of Anhui Province
proposed to apply for the World Bank loan. The total length is 94.73km. This
component is also one of the highway improvement projects in the 10 five-year plan.
This is the action to promote transportation condition of Huaibei Plain of Anhui
Province and lay better foundation for local economic development and flow of goods
and people.
The civil works of the project shall implement within the range of existing reserved
subgrade, thus there is no requirement for additional land acquisition or demolition or
resettlement. According to the investigation and consultation with Anhui Provincial
Cultural Relics Administration Bureau and Fuyang Municipal Forestry Bureau, there
are not any special environmental sensitive objects requiring protection along the
highway such as natural protective zones, cultural relics, historic sites, tourist
landscapes, wild animals and plants.
The project implementation has sound social basis and natural environment. The
monitoring results of major sensitive points along the highway showthat noise of
daytime and nighttime basically meet Class I set in "Environment Noise
Standard in Urban Area" (GB3096-93) . The monitoring of air environment shows
the daily concentration value of TSP and hourly concentration value of NO2 and CO
are both below the limits of Class II set in "Environment Air Quality Standard".
Concentration value of CODCr and BODs of the major pollutants contained in the
water body of rivers is below the limit of Class V classified in "Pavement Water
Environment Quality Standard" . Therefore environment quality of water, air and
noise is basically good. The other ecological environment and social environment
shall not produce constraining impacts.
During the implementation, noise and dust generated by the construction shall
produce certain effects on the sensitive points along the highway, but the impacts are
temporary and limited to the acceptable level. In the operation period, due to the
increase of traffic, noise and polluted air generated shall cause negative effects on the
sensitive points along the highway. The impacts shall be limited to the least degree
once the "three simultaneousness" is put into practice, highway environmental
management, supervision system, environmental monitoring data management and
report procedure shall be reinforced meanwhile.
To sum up, this project would produce negative effects on the resident's life, school's
study and hospital's wards. However as long as the mitigation measures proposed in
EIA are actually taken, the unfavorable effects will be effectively controlled and
decreased to the lowest degree. Through the comprehensive assessment, the social
benefits and economical benefits are considerable. 100% of the people along the
highway support the project. Therefore this project is feasible in conclusion.
