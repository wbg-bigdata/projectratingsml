1. General Description
1.1 Project Background
1.1.1 Project Source
The proposed G31 8Huaining section (1 ) Beneficial to the economic development in
the poverty stricken areas; (2 ) Favorable to transportation centralization and
decentralization of the main route (Hefei-Anqing Expressway ) ; (3) Fitted for the
provincial 0I five-year plan of highway improvement, and priority given to the
sections which have started construction but not completed yet in the 9gh five year
plan so as to improve efficiency of the whole route and the road network; (4) The
existing road sections cannot meet the increasing demand for transportation and need
rehabilitation. (5) The average indicators (PQI) of road surface quality are low and
surface is poor.
G3 18 Huaining section is located in the south central areas of Anhui Province where
the major transportation relies only on road for there is no railway to reach these areas.
As the economy develops and the transportation increases, the existing road of narrow
surface and poor quality cannot match the demands of economic development and
transportation. Thus, Anhui Provincial Communications Department is applying for
the World Bank loan (remaining savings) to support the rehabilitation of G318
Huaining highway section. The project is of great significance for improving the
condition of transportation to the outside in the poverty stricken areas and stimulating
local economic development and bettering the people's life.
At the request of Anhui Provincial Communications Department of China, in July,
2001, Anhui Provincial Highway Administration Bureau entrusted the job of
environmental assessment and preparation of the environmental impact assessment on
G318 Huaining section of highway maintenance, to Hefei Design & Research
Institute, Ministry of Coal Industry.
1.1.2 Status of Environmental Assessment
The assessment unit, after accepting the entrustment, set up an environmental
assessment group in July 2001. The group together with Anhui Provincial Highway
Administration Bureau and Anhui Provincial Highway Survey and Design Institute
carried out field visits and public participation and consultation along G318 Huaining
highway section. The group conducted deep field investigation relating environmental
status and environmental protective targets along the section. Based on the site visits,
data collection and further study of the project feasibility study report, the group
worked out the draft "Environmental Impact Report of G318 Huaining Section of
Highway Maintenance Component of the World Bank financed Anhui Provincial
Highway Project of China". The group got assistance from the environmental experts
of the World Bank in the preparation of the report. Now the draft report is ready for
the World Bank review.



1.2 Aim of the Environmental Assessment
Qualitative or quantitative anticipation analysis and assessment are made on the
possible environmental impact to be brought by the project construction. The work
has been done on the base of the investigation into the natural and social environment
and environmental quality within the assessment range of G3 18 Huaining section, and
on the base of the combination with the understanding of the environmental status and
relative environmental issues along the section. The report shall point out the potential
problems and propose effective and reasonable alleviating measure correspondingly.
The alleviating measure shall be put into practice to reduce the environmental impact
during the project construction and operation to the lowest degree. The following
targets shall be reached as well.
( I ) Possible environmental impact during the construction as well as the impact
range and degree shall be fairly and objectively identified.
(2 ) Investigation result shall be presented in the report based on the understanding of
the public opinions via the investigation along the section.
(3) Various measures of prevention, alleviation and reduction to the lowest degree of
the negative impact shall be proposed, established on thc result of environmental
impact anticipation and applicable compensation methods shall be proposed as well.
The aim is to identify negative impact before the construction, raise attention in
finalizing the design document and bid contract, and carry out the alleviation methods
during the construction period.
(4) The environmental assessment shall work as decision making reference,
provided to the highway administration departments and local goverrnent institutions
along the section in making environmental administration plan and environmental
development programs.

3. Environment Description
3.1 Natural Environment
3.1 1 Topography
The project area has complicated topography due to the impact of Dabie highland and
Changjiang valley, sloping from northwest to southeast. The terrain is divided into
eroded low mountains and piled hills because of denudation around mountains.
3.1.2 Meteorological Phenomena and Climate
Huaining belongs to the north subtropical zone with warm temperate and monsoon
climate that has the features described as evident monsoon, clear four seasons, warm
whether, rich rainfall, enough sunshine and long frost-free season. Table 3-1 shows
major meteorological parameters of project areas

Note: Data are extracted from national economnc statistics of the year 2000 of Huaimng County
3.1.3 Soil Vegetation
Yellow and brown soil is the main soil of the local soil type and the paddy soil is the
second.
The whole area is classified as medium sub tropical zone in the south with the
vegetation belt mixed of deciduous leave, broad-leaved evergreen and coniferous
forest. There is little natural vegetation due to the long time of human activities. At
present, most existing vegetation on both sides of the road and around houses are
planted, namely white poplar, ailanthus, pagoda-tree, locust, platen, paulownia;
Farming crops are wheat, paddy rice, bean, oil crop, peanut, cotton, vegetable, melon
and fruits.
3.1.4 Soil Erosion Status
According to the classification of soil erosion type of China, Huaining county belongs
to southem red soil hilly area, having hydrodynamic erosion as the main feature. It is
identified in the data provided by Huaining County Water Resource Department, local
soil erosion modulus is 1500 t/cm2 . a, ranking as slightly eroded grade. The soil loss
volume exceeds 500tIkm2 . a of soil unit loss allowance set by the state.
3.1.5 Surface Water Status
13



There are two major rivers in this area, Zhuliu river and Sanqiao river. Both rivers
belong to Wan river system. The district is rich in surface water resources, about
483,000 m3 on average, per capita 1133 m3 and per mu of land 1375 m3 in the normal
year. However water resource scatters unevenly, with much in the south while less in
the north, much in the mountains while less in the hills, much in the summer while
less in the winter.
3.2 Ecological Environment
3.2.1 Natural Ecological Environment
The project is located in the slight hilly areas of Jianghuai Plain and Huaibei Plain
where the history of human activities is very long and there is not any group of
large-sized wild animals or natural vegetation. There is few rare wild animals or
vegetation to be protected in this place. The man-planted vegetation and small wild
animals could be seen within 200 m away from the highway, including forestation in
the mounds, green belts on both sides of the highway, farming crops in the fields and
various small wild animals as frogs, snakes and insects as well.
The trees along the road are man-planted as poplar, platen, paulownia and willow and
grow fine. Arbors are planted in the town and villages along the road and nearby, such
as poplar, platen, paulownia, elm and metasequoia etc.
According to the investigation along the highway and consultation with Huaining
County Cultural Relics Administration Sector and Huaining County Forestation
Bureau, there are not any natural protective zones, cultural relics, historic sites and
wide animals and plants which need protection, within 200m away from the central
line of the highway.
3.2.2 Agricultural Ecological Environment
Most part of the project area is farming land. The main crops along the section are
paddy rice, wheat, oil crop, corn, sweet potato and cotton and there is also forest in
some areas. The crop output is usually high due to the suitable climate and rich soil
and convenient irrigation. The people living nearby raise livestock and fowls,
including pigs, cattle, sheep, chicken, ducks and geese etc. The raised aquatic
products along the section are bighead, silver carp, crucian, carp and grass carp.
Besides, there are some tea gardens, fruit trees of peach, pear, apple and so on. Local
farmers plant various vegetables as greens, peppers, pumpkins and white gourds etc.
3.3 Social Economy
The project covers the areas of Huaining County. The basic infornation of the project
areas is shown in Table 3-2.

Note: The data are extracted from Statistics in 2001 of Huaining County.
According to "Anhui Provincial Statistics in the year 2000" (see Table 3-2), per capita
GDP of Huaining County is lower compared with per capita GDP of Anhui Province
and Anqing City, only accounting for 76% and 86% respectively. Less developed
transportation is thought as one reason for the low GDP of the county. The project is
believed to create more opportunities for local farmers to enter the market and
participate in the competition so as to get rid of poverty.

GDP (%)
The transportation relies on the highway in the county. Railway and waterway are less
developed. It is known from the investigation that all the towns and villages have
simple road connecting the state highway or provincial highway and have access to
electricity and telephones as well. The local township govermnents and villages
always lay emphasis on water conservation, so agricultural irrigation system is quite
good and the towns and villages have certain capacity of flood control and drainage
and resisting against drought.
3.4 Living Quality
The investigation shows that over 99 % of proper aged children in this area are
educated in the school. Local governments pay much attention to education. In
addition to the schools set up by the governments, all kinds of training classed are
held to update people's skill and capacity. Various social resources and channels are
mobilized to promote people's cultural knowledge.
There are 3 township clinics along the road, 3 middle schools and 6 primary schools
A clinic is usually equipped with 10-20 wards and cures common diseases. Serious
patients must be sent to city /county hospitals. The road improvement could better the
healthy condition of rural residents and benefit the immediate save of serious patients
15



in this sense.
3.5 Natural Resources
The district is located in the down stream of Changjiang river with main metal mines
like copper, iron, gold, silver, lid, zinc, molybdenum and tungsten. There are also
various energy resources such as soft coal, hard coal and uranium. Besides, there are
many building materials like marble, tabular spar, lime, Baibei Stone and quartz
stone.

4. Environmental Status Investigation and Assessment
4.1 Monitoring and Assessment of Environment Quality
4 1.1 Acoustic Environment
For the purpose of obtaining the information of environment noise, the environment
sensitive points were monitored from Jan. 22, 2002-Jan. 30, 2002 along the highway.
The distribution of monitoring points is shown in Drawing 4-1. Table 4-1 shows
monitoring record of environment noise Status. The environment noise of daytime is
48.0-56.2dB (A) and nighttime is 38.6-46.3dB (A) . The environment noise of
daytime and nighttime of 7# Shijin Town Clinic exceeds the limit of Class I
stipulated in "Environmental Noise Standard in Urban Areas" (GB3096-93) by
1.2dB(A) and 1,3dB(A), because the clinic is so near the highway. The clinic has
taken some measures by equipping alufer windows. The noise metered in the patient
ward declined to 47.2dB(A) in the daytime and 39.2dB(A) at night with window
closed. Except for this clinic, all the other sensitive points meet the limit of Class 1 of
"Environmental Noise Standard in Urban Areas" (GB3096-93),    which means that
traffic noise does not have much impact on the sensitive points along the highway.

4.1.2 Environment Air
Xioushan Hospital and Sanqiao Hospital were selected as representatives along the
highway to be monitored for the assessment of environment air. Xioushan Hospital is
located in the village surrounded by farming land. The monitoring result could
represent the environment air quality of the villages near the highway. Sanqiao
Hospital is in Sanqiao Town along the highway. The monitoring result could represent
the environment air quality of towns on the banks of the highway. The monitoring
lasted for 3 days from Jan. 22, 2002-Jan. 24, 2002. Sampling was taken 4 times a
day. The distribution of monitoring points is shown in Drawing 4-1. Table 4-2 shows
monitoring record of environment air Status showing the value of TSP, NO2 and CO
meet the limits of Class II set out in "Environment Air Quality Standard"
(GB3095-1996).

4.2 Investigation into Industrial Pollution Generators
According to the investigation into industrial pollution generators, there are not any
large sized constant industrial pollution generators along the highway, except for
some small brickyards, township agricultural side products processing small-sized
plants and social service sectors. Due to the poor surface of the highway, much instant
TSP is produced when vehicle passes by. This affects air enviromnent of the highway
to some degree but the impact is limited. Meanwhile, air whistle loud speakers are
used frequently so that noise dB exceeds the limit instantly. In a word, the poor road
and noise of vehicle shall cause some impact on the residents' life near the highway.
4.3 Special Environment Investigation
According to the investigation along the highway and consultation with Huaining
County Cultural Relics Administration Sector and Huaining County Forestry Bureau,
there are not any natural protective zones, cultural relics, historic sites and wild
animals and plants which need protection, within 200m away from the central line of
the highway. Huaining County Cultural Relics Administration Sector and Huaining
County Forestation Bureau presented the documents for evidence. See Annex 2 and
Annex 3.
However in case any buried ancient graves or historic ruins are discovered, the
contractor shall have to report to local cultural relics and historical site administration
departments. The contractor shall not go on constructing until relative departments
complete concerned work.

5. Forecast and Evaluation of Potential Environmental impact
5.1 Construction Period
The construction type of G318 Huaining section is classified as "rehabilitation", that
is, to widen and reinforce the road surface and subgrade, with cement to pave the road
surface. The existing road surface will be widened from 9.0m to 12.0 m on the base of
the existing subgrade. G318 Huaining section covers a whole length of 31.830km. In
the design document, the project does not involve in land acquisition and settlement.
During 2 years' construction period, the negative impact of the construction on the
nearby environment would cover the following aspects:
5.1.1 Impact on Acoustic Environment Quality
5.1.1.1 Impact of Mechanical Noise on Both sides of the Highway
During the construction of G318 Huaining section, various machines and vehicles
would be used. The main machinery contains shovel loaders, road rollers, paver
buckets and dumpers that would make unavoidable noise during the construction.
Dumpers are used to transport construction materials like cobblestones, sand and
concrete, which would increase the traffic volume and affect to a larger scope. Table
5-1 shows the noise levels of various machines and vehicles.

Note. he construction machinery and the noise values are adopted from "Standards for Environmental Impact
Evaluation m Highway Construction (Trial Implementation)" (JTJO05-96).
Most of the section passes through open fields and the rest passes through towns and
villages. There are just a few houses on both sides, and most are used for commerce.
Therefore, the direct noise impact on people is not serious. During the implementation
of the project, the noise of construction and traffic would affect the quality of the
residents' life on both sides of the road.
G3 18 Huaining section covers a whole length of 31.830km, crossing the areas named
Yeshan Town, Shiqiao Town, Shijing Town, Duxiu village, Huangdun Town, Sanqiao
Town, Zhongliang village, Xiaoshi Town and etc. Many of the houses are for
commercial use. The middle and primary schools and hospitals within 200m away
from the road are presented in the following Table 5-2.

"Noise Limits of Construction Site" (GB 12523-90) stipulates: noise of construction
site is limited to 70-75dB (A) in the daytime and 55dB (A) at night. Table 5-3
shows that the distance within 40m in the daytime meets the regulated noise limit. At
night, the distance beyond 200m can basically meet the noise limit.
According to the investigation, 9 middle and primary schools and 3 clinics will be
affected within the distance of 40m- 120m by the noise on both sides of the road of
Huaining section. The construction noise might affect the sensitive points, but add
little to the existing traffic noise. Thus, the construction noise in the daytime might
generate slight impact on schools and hospitals. The strong noise of machines is
forbidden at night in the places of adjacent hospitals. But night work will be done to
reduce the daytime noise when the highway goes through a school without night
students.
5.1.1.2 Impact of Mechanical Noise from the Mixing Station on the Environment
The concrete mixing station will be set up at K22+600, the maintenance squad during
the bridge construction. On the investigation of the site, there are no environmental
sensitive points (such as schools, residential areas, sanatoriums or hotels) to be
protected within 100m.
Based on the analogy monitoring to the concrete mixing station by Hefei
Environmental Monitoring Station, the actual tested noise values are shown in Table
54. The actual tested values show the noise values of the concrete mixing station are
55.4-57.6dB (A) in the daytime and 42.9-46.8dB (A) at night at the places 1.0m
from the boundaries. So the noise values both in the daytime and at night exceed the
"Noise Limits for Site Boundary of Industrial Enterprises" (GB 12348-90) Class I.
I-lowever, by the estimate, the environment noise at 60m away from the concrete
mixing station can meet the requirements of "Urban Areas Environment Noise
Limits" Class I. Because there are no sensitive points within 100m of the site, it is
believed in the evaluation that the noise will not affect the environment and people
nearby.

5.1.2 Impact on Environment Air Quality
5.1.2.1 Impact of Road Dust on Air Environment
During the construction period, the flying dust is mainly caused by the wind erosion
on the bare road surface. The flying dust depends upon the travel speed of the vehicles
passed by, the wind speed, the dust volume on the road and the dust humidity, among
which the wind speed directly depend on the transmission distance. Table 5-5 shows
the analogy monitoring to the flying dust in the similar condition that the necessary
watering will reduce the flying duct 50%-80% during the construction. The impact on
air environment will be distinctly decreased. And the TSP density at the distance 30m
leeward can meet the "Environment Air Quality Limits " (GB3095-1996) Class
I.
TSP of the Construction Road
Table 5-5
Distance to the road (m)  0       20        30        100       200
TSP density  No watering  3 64   0 95      0.38       0.28      0.18
(mg/m3)    Watering    0.70     0.46      0.22       0.20      0.10
5.1.2.2 Impact of Tai Gas on Air Environment
As the transportation increases, the NO2 and CO in the tail gas by vehicles increase as
well. According to he analogy monitoring conducted within the distance of 30m on
both sides of the road, the average density per hour of NO2 and CO is 0.037-0.066
mg/m3 and 0.95> 1.65 mg/M3, which meet the limits of Class II set in "Environment
Air Quality Limits" ( GB3095-1996). Therefore, it can be said that the NO2 and CO
in the tail gas by the increasing vehicles will not pollute the air environment on both
sides of the road.
5.1.2.3 Impact of Concrete Mixing Station on Air Environment
It is planned to lay 381960 m2 of cement on road surface. The major pollutant is TSP
when mixed, but the volume is very little. According to the analogy monitoring to the
concrete mixing station by Hefei Environmental Monitoring Station, the average
density per day of TSP is 0.11 mg/m3 and 0.08mg/M3 respectively at the distance 50m
and 100m leeward of the mixing station, which is quite lower than the "Environment
Air Quality Limits" (GB3095-1996) Class II. Therefore, as long as the mixing
station is set up leeward away from the sensitive points, towns or villages, the major
pollutant TSP will not affect anywhere. As there are no sensitive points within lOOm,
it is considered in the evaluation that the mixing station will have no impact on air
environment.
5.1.2.4 Impact of Construction Campsite on Air Environment
The main pollutants in the construction campsite are TSP and SO2 from the cooking
24



stoves. As the campsites use the house of the maintenance squad and it is in the wild
field, and there are a small number of workers, the impact on the air environment is
slight.
5.1.3 Impact on Ecological Environment
The implementation of this project is to widen and reinforce shoulders of the existing
road into road surface, there would be little impact on the enological environment.
Some weeds on the shoulders and part of bush vegetation would be cut and destroyed.
Around 4200 trees might be cut in the course of widening the road. There is not any
grassland along the road. Since no land acquisition occurs, vegetation of farming field
on both sides of the road would remain the same as before. The vegetation outside of
the road shoulders would not be affected.
In addition, some TSP pollutants would be generated due to the mixing of surface
materials during the construction and would land on the vegetation and leaves of
crops. Thanks to the rich rainfall in this area, the TSP landed on leaves would be
rushed away with the rainwater and would not stay long, the impact on the growth of
plants is negligible.
5.1.4 Impact on the Surface Water Environment
During the construction period, the impact on the water environment involve in the
following aspects: the residential wastewater and garbage in the construction campsite,
the wastewater of washing machinery and the dropped machine oil in maintenance,
and the watering when rolling the road.
5.1.4.1 Watering in the Construction
During the works of rehabilitation of surface, water content would be kept for surface
reinforcement in the rolling to reach the required degree of enforcement. Limited
water would be used for the mixing of reinforcing materials and rolling. The water
would be absorbed quickly by materials of surface and leave little water into the side
ditches and farmland. Consequently there is no impact on water environment.
5.1.4.2 Residential Wastewater in the Construction Campsite
There are 2 contract sections in this project, and each has set upl campsite, so there
are 2 campsites. On the basis of the existing construction rules, each section has about
40 workers. The water used is limited, for there is no bathroom in the campsite and
the toilet without water (dry toilet). In the investigation to the actual water
consumption in the Hefei-Anqing Highway, the maximum water used is about 60
I/p/d, that is, the water consumption in each campsite comes up to 2.4m3/d and the
wastewater is about 2.0m3/d. Therefore, the residential wastewater has a little impact
on the surface water. As long as necessary measures are taken, the impact on water
environment can be reduced to very little.
5.1.4.3 Wastewater in Washing Machinery and Dropped Machine oil in Maintenance
When the machinery needs repairing and washing in a rainy day, the water used is just
a little. Generally it can go directly into the ground, with little impact on the surface
25



water.
There is no maintenance station in the construction, and all the repair work is done at
the maintenance shops in the city or county. As result, no dropped machine oil in the
construction site will affect the surface water.
5.1.4.4 Residential Garbage in the Construction Campsite
The residential garbage of the workers is rather little. It volumes to about 20kg in each
campsite in term of 0.5kg/p/d. It will be classified and treated in different ways.
Therefore, the residential garbage will not affect the surface water environment with
proper measures taken.
5.1.5 Impact on the Irrigation System
As the project works on the rehabilitation of road surface, no river is involved.
However, the road will pass through some of the irrigation system in the farmland.
The irrigation canals, which come across the highway, will be increased in length,
without changing the direction of water flow and flow volume. As long as attention
will be paid not to block the ditches, canals or culvert with the construction materials
so as to let the water through, the construction will have no affect on the water
environment and the irrigation system.
5.1.6 Inpact on Soil and Water Conservation
This project lies in hills. On base of the "Standards for Classes and Grades of Soil
Erosion" (SL190-96) by the People's Republic of China, it belongs to southern hills
with red soil. The allowable loss of soil and water is 50OVtkm2 . a. Owing to the
rehabilitation of the existing road surface, the affected area is small. According to the
documents provided by Huaning Irrigation Bureau, the soil and water erosion
modulus in this area 1 50Vt/km2/a, the total volume of soil and water erosion will
volume to 573t in this construction. So soil erosion caused by loss of soil and water in
the construction is temporary and not serious.
5.1.7 Impact on Traffic in Bridge Construction
5.1.7.1 Impact on Traffic
It has been considered in the design that temporary paths will be set up to let the
vehicles and people pass through. So the bridge construction will have some affect on
the traffic, but very little.
5.1.7.2 Impact on Construction Machinery on the Environment
There are no schools and hospitals with 100m of the bridges to be built Therefore, the
noise of bridge construction will have slight impact on the sensitive points.
5.1.7.3 Impact on the Loss of Soil and Water
Because the base of the bridge will be dug down widely, the dug-out earthwork may
cause loss of soil and water. However, the dug-open area is small and the loss of soil
and water is relevantly small. The rivers crossed by the highway are all seasoning
rivers, and they flow almost dry in winter. If the work is done in the dry season, the
26



loss will be reduced to lowest degree. Therefore, the loss of soil and water in bridge
construction is slight.
5.1.7.4 Impact on Water Quality in the Rivers
No wastewater will be discharged in bridge construction, so it will have no impact on
the water quality.
5.1.8 Traffic Environment and Others
In order to keep the traffic open during the construction, half of the road is under
construction and the two halves in turn which might inevitably cause jam and affect
traffic environment to some degree. However the negative effect is only temporary.
There must be assigned person in charge of monitoring the traffic to ensure the
project's quality and traffic order.
In addition, certain affect would be generated by busy traffic of transportation on the
construction site and would certainly bring inconvenience to the production activities,
travel, living and rest of the residents along the road. But the impact is limited and
could be acceptable.
To sum up, the potential impact during the construction would be affect of traffic
noise and TSP pollutants generated on air environment. As long as necessary
measures are taken, the impact on the environment will be reduced to the lowest
degree. In Chinese tradition, road repair has been considered as a kind of charities, so
nobody would complain about it.
5.2 Operation Period
5.2.1 Impact from Traffic Noise
When this project comes into operation, the traffic condition would be greatly
improved after the completion of the project. The forecast of the traffic volume in
G318 Huaining section in Table 2-3 shows that traffic volume would increase from
the average 3309 no./d in the year of 2001 to 6393 no./day in 2010, and from the
average 8649 no./d in the year of 2015 to 14083 no./day in 2025. The noise affect of
traffic would rise as the traffic volume grows. The major affected residents are in:
Yueshan Town, Shiqiao Town, Shiqing Town, Dunxiu Village, Huangdun Town,
Sanqiao Town, Zhongliang Village, Xiaoshi Town. Most of houses on both sides of
the road are for commercial purpose. As a result, the number of direct affected people
by the traffic noise is restricted.
When China Highway Project conducts EIA, Class I and IV of "Urban Area
Environment Noise Limits" (GB3096-93) are used. The specific limits are shown in
the Table 1-2.
4 primary schools, 4 middle schools and 3 hospitals are located within 200m on either
bank of the road, and 30- 120 m away directly from the road. Estimate of
environmental sensitive points of traffic noise from G318 Huaining Section is
presented in the Table 5-6. Compared with the "Urban Areas Environment Noise
Limits" Class I, the estimate shows there are some impact of traffic noise on Datang
27



Primary School, Shijing Primary School, Sanqiao Primary School, Sisong Primary
School and Shijing Clinic. The impact on Shijing Clinic is the most serious, that
would be 4.6dB (A) in the daytime and 7.8 dB (A) at night in 2005, and 5.3dB (A)
in the daytime and 8.8 dB (A) at night in 2010.

5.2.2 Impact on Environment Air
During the operation of the project, the increasing emission of NO2 and CO would
grow on environment air quality along the road corresponding to the rise of traffic
flow by years. Nevertheless, the road is in the plain area with trees on both sides and
good vegetation that is beneficial to air diffusion.
Table 5-7 shows the forecast of the tail gas in G318 Huaining section based on the
designed traffic volume. Compared with the "Environment Air Quality Limits"
(GB3095-1996) Class II, the emission of pollutants NO2 and CO beyond lOm on
both sides of the highway can meet the standards. Therefore, the impact is slight on
the environment along the road.
28

After the completion of G318 Huaining section, the traffic condition of the road
would be improved greatly. The TSP produced by vehicles would decrease
correspondingly compared with the existing road. The impact of TSP to the sensitive
points would decline as well.
In conclusion, the potential environmental impact of this project is from traffic noise
and slight tail gas.
5.3 Other Environment Problems
On the basis of the features of this "rehabilitation" project and the description of
environment, the evaluation group thinks that the suggested project involves no
intensive rehabilitation activities or sensitive areas, therefore, the impacts on the
following environment problems are tiny or can be neglected:
(1) There is slight affect on wild animals, for there are no species of wild
animals.
(2) There are no natural protection areas, scenic spots, cultural relics and historic
sites along the road.
(3) The "rehabilitation" project will not fetch or discard the earth, so there are no
ecological problems.
(4) This project involves no land acquisition or resettlement.

6.2 Possible Environmental Impact Compensation Measures
6.2.1 Design Period
6.2.1.1 Store Bulk Materials
In design, the stacking site of the building materials carried from outside and the
material mixing station should be kept as far as possible away from towns, residential
areas, schools and hospitals and when designed. The easily dusting power materials
must be covered.
6.2.1.2 Design the Culverts
In the design, because the road surface is widened, the length of the culverts crossed
with the highway must be relevantly added. The diameters or sections in part of the
culverts are increased in order to guarantee the water flow.
6.2.1.3 Control the Road Dust
In the construction procedure, watering equipment must be designed in order to water
31



the easily-dusting materials and decrease the dust.
6.2.1.4 Select the Site for the Concrete Mixing Station
Yard mix is designed for the concrete of the road, and the site for the mixing station
will be selected in accordance with the requirements of EIA. The maintenance squad
is used for the station. There are no sensitive points within 100m. The mixer is
equipped with dust-protected apparatus to reduce the flying powder.
6.2.1.5 Greening
In the design of the rehabilitation project, the green belt outside the embankment on
both sides of the highway, the slope protection works and side ditches must be taken
into account. The varieties of vegetation should be properly selected in the design. All
this must be designed with the main project.
6.2.1.6 Set Road Signs
Road signs at crossed have been considered in the design, such as no whistling for
towns, schools and hospitals, speed limit, pedestrian crosswalk, road bend and etc.
6.2.2 Construction Period
The potential environmental irnpacts in the construction period involved in the traffic
noise and road dust. The following mitigation measures are suggested:
6.2.2.1 Mixing Concrete
Central yard mix of concrete must be used to decline the impact on air environment
and acoustic environment. In the design, the site for the mixing station and the mixing
equipment of environmental protection are selected. The construction must be in
keeping with the design
6.2.2.2 Control the Construction Dust
In the construction period, it is necessary to water the easily-dusting sections and
materials in a fixed time, especially in the sections passing through villages and towns.
In dry days, it is necessary to water 4 times a day in order to reduce the dust pollution
to the nearby environment.
6.2.2.3 Store Bulk Materials and Prevent Dust
Bulk materials must be stored 200m away from the sensitive sites of schools,
hospitals, towns and villages. In dry days with strong wind, the easily-dusting bulk
materials must be covered by canvas or plastic cloth to prevent the air pollution in the
construction sections.
6.2.2.4 Treat Wastes
Owing to all the building materials carried from outside, there are few wastes. If any,
the action of central disposition in each section will be taken to conserve the water
and soil.
32



6.2.2.5 Protect Crops
The construction unit has the responsibility to tell the staff and workers to pay
attention to protect the fields and crops along construction sections and not to destroy
the farmland, so as to decrease the damage to the crops.
6.2.2.6 Ensure Traffic Order
The half-side pavement will be used in the rehabilitation project, thus traffic block
will not be avoided. In the construction sections, warning signs or detour signs must
be put to ensure the project quality and keep the traffic in good order. There must be
assigned person in charge of conducting the traffic.
6.2.2.7 Water and Soil Conservation
When working with the fill or excavation, the exposed slopes must be done with
vegetation. Some slopes and side ditches must be built up with bricks or stones, as
designed, to stop the water and soil being washed away in the operation period.
6.2.2.8 Prevention Measures in Bridge Construction
Temporary paths are considered in the design in order to reduce the impact on the
traffic. It is suggested in the bridge construction that the surplus earth be used to
strengthen the embankment of the river to reduce the block of river course and loss of
water and soil. Moreover, it would be better to build the bridge in a dry season, if
possible, to reduce the loss of water and soil. After the construction, the construction
unit must clear up the reminders in case of blocking the river.
6.2.2.9 Cultural Relic Protection
The on-the-spot investigation and the document provided by Huaining Cultural Relic
Sector show that there are no cultural relics and historic sites within 200m along the
highway. If any cultural relics are found in the earth, work must be laid aside and the
spot must be protected while reporting to Huaining Cultural Relics Sector. Only after
the cultural relics are unearthed, the work can go on by the approval of the cultural
relic sector. Before the construction, the contractor must tell the workers that all the
cultural relics and historical sites are state property. Everybody has the responsibility
to protect it and hand in the cultual relics that are found to the local cultural relics
sector. Anyone cannot snatch in an uproar and hide in private.
6.2.2.10 Road Signs
By the end of the construction, the construction unit must set up the road signs in line
with the design. Most of all, the sign of no whistling must be placed at the distance of
100m in the front of schools and hospitals within 200m on both sides of the highway
to reduce the traffic noise.
When the highway goes through villages and towns and there are schools and
hospitals on the sides of the highway, signs of speed limit, village, crosswalk must be
set according to the rules to avoid or reduce traffic accidents.
6.2.2.11 Greening
33



As the highway goes through the sensitive sections of villages, towns, schools and
hospitals, attentions must be paid to the selection of tree varieties to lessen the
pollution and beautify the environrment. The greening works must be finished together
with the main project. About 4200 trees will be cut down when widening the highway,
however, 25265 trees (6493 arbors and 18772 bushes) will be replanted after the
rehabilitation.
6.2.2.12 Drainage of Road Surface
The slopes of the subgrade and side ditches will be improved. The easily-washed
slopes will be built with ditches and laid with bricks or planted with vegetation to
protect soil erosion.
6.2.2.13 Environmental Sanitation and Disease Prevention in Campsites
It is essential to pay attention to environmental sanitation and disease prevention. (1)
toilets must be placed; (2) deposit tank must be set up to collect the residential
wastewater; (3) daily garbage must be centralized to fill in spare places; (4) clean
fuels will be used in cooking stoves to decrease the smokes; (5) propaganda column
must be set up to prevent contagious disease and venereal diseases.
During the construction period, the contractor is responsible for the worker's health
check. If anyone is infected with contagious diseases or AIDS, the one must be sent to
hospital at once or be separated for treatment. The contractor must tell the workers the
knowledge of disease prevention and good health habits. Drug taking and whoring are
banned to avoid contagious diseases or AIDS. If found, the one will be expelled and
sent to the public security organs.
6.2.2.14 Set Accusation Signs for Environment Pollution
The construction unit must set up accusation signs for environment pollution in the
sensitive points, with the name of the construction unit, telephone number, the person
in charge and the telephone number for the local EPB to solve the environmental
problems in time if something occurs.
6.2.3 Operation Period
6.2.3.1 Measures to Prevent Traffic Noise
Through the noise forecast in the operation period, the impact of traffic noise on the
environment sensitive points outdoors would meet the requirements of "Urban Areas
Environment Noise Limits" (GB3096-93) Class I.
6.2.3.2 Maintain Greening and Slopes
In the operation period, close attention must be paid to keep 100% of the replanted
trees alive. Meanwhile, side ditches and slope protection must be maintained to keep
the ditches through. If the green belt or the slope have any damage, new trees will be
replanted and the slope will be repaired in time. The green belt will be cultivated and
pruned, and the harmful insects will be killed regularly. It is necessary to let the
residents know the importance of road protection.
34



6.2.3.3 Maintain Road Signs
Various kinds of road signs will be set up by the end of the construction. And the
signs must be immediately changed or replaced if they are damaged or missed in the
operation period.
6.2.3.4 Monitor the tail gas
The highway management sector must cooperate with the local environmental
monitoring station and check the tail gas from the vehicles at a regular time. The
unqualified vehicles are banned to travel in the highway.
6.2.3.5 Manage Environment
The highway squad is directly in charge of maintaining the road surface, the ditches
and slopes as well. Meanwhile the squad is responsible to repair the damaged water
conservation and greening. A management plan will be made out for the responsibility
in each section so as to keep the highway and environmental protection in good order.
6.2.3.6 Monitor Environment
In both construction and operation periods, the environmental monitoring plan in the
EIA must be taken into great accounts, moreover, be implemented in accordance with
the requirements.
6.2.4 Preventive Measures to Environmental Impacts
6.2.4.1 Table 6-2 shows the action plan for the environmental protection in G318
Huaining section. Table 6-3 shows the mitigation measures to the major
environmental impacts.

The cost estimate of environmental protection and environmental benefits of G318
Huaining Highway Section in the construction period and operation period are shown
in Table 6-8.
6.5.2 Environmental benefits
The greening works on the sides of the highway can not only change the scenery,
improve the ecological environment and reduce water lose and soil erosion, but also
decrease the road dust pollution owing to the fallen tree leaves. The environmental
monitoring can find out the degree of noise impact on the sensitive sites so as to take
effective mitigation measures if necessary. Therefore, the greening works and
environmental monitoring help ecological environment and human health. There are
distinct environrmental benefits.

7.1.1 Investigation Method and Interviewees
As required by the 253rd order "Environmental Protection Management Rules" issued
by the State Council dated on Nov.29, 1998 and EIA, the assessment institute
conducted investigation into government departments, organizations, schools of G3 18
Huaining project areas and residents along the highway in August, 2001. The staff of
the institute visited over 5 villages and 6 schools and 3 hospitals that might be
affected by the project, focusing on the attitude of the residents, teachers and students
towards the project of "rehabilitation" and their comments on contrary strategies to
alleviate the impact.
The investigation consisted of various forms like meetings, visits, written interviews
and inquiries. Up to now 2 meetings have been held, 142 people have been inquired
52 papers of written interview have been distributed and 52 papers have been
collected back. The general background of people involved with the investigation is

3 It is necessary to educate the "Highway Laws" to raise the realization of taking care
of the highway
The following is the summary of the public opinions:
1. 100%    of the participants support the rehabilitation ofG318 Huaining section. They
think first priority should be given to the construction of road in the process of
becoming rich. To build road would benefit both the country and the people as well.
2. Participants think that construction of road could promote the traffic conditions,
stimulate the economy, and improve the residents living quality. The respective
percentage is 100%, 100%        and 57.7%.
3. 38.5%     and 13.5%    participants think the impact of the road building is traffic noise
and dust.
4. 34.6% and 61.5% participants think traffic jam and dust would be the focus people
most concern in the construction period. Another 9.6% participants have not
expressed any comments. The focus that people most care most during the operation
period is traffic noise, vehicle tail air and sidewalks. The corresponding percentage of
47



participants is 76.9%, 9.6% and 5.8%.
5. 86.5% and 13.5% of the participants expressed their active attitude towards the
protection of the road and greening of sides of the highway.
7.1.3 Public Opinion and Suggestions
The investigation shows, although some participants think the construction and
operation of the highway might produce negative effects such as traffic noise, dust
and polluted air on the residents, this negative effect would be alleviate by way of
planting trees on both sides of the highway after construction. In a word, the
construction of the project would produce much more positive effect than negative
effect.
Most participants wish the project start the sooner the better so as to let the highway
contribute earlier to society, environment and economy. In addition, it is suggested
that highway administration departments should enforce the highway administration
and maintenance and greening as well for the purpose of keeping the highway in good
condition.
To sum up, 100% participants expressed their positive attitude toward the project,
which plays a good foundation for the project. Highway administration departrnents
and construction units shall fully concem the public opinions and suggestions and try
their efforts to bring the project into full play.

assessment group published information 14 in the activities of public participation.
After the completion of draft EIA, Information 5 was provided to concerned social
organizations. All the information were printed and issued to the concerned people or
organizations that were inquired.
* Information 1 - Construction Target
The project name: G318 Huaining Section of Highway Maintenance Component of
Anhui Provincial Highway Project of China. The project is the subproject of Hefei-
Anqing Expressway. The first target is to improve transportation conditions of the
poor areas of the provincial west. The second is to promote the surface quality and
traffic capacity to assure the safety of drive. The third is to increase people's life level
and encourage local economy via the rehabilitation.
* Information 2- Project Description
G3 18 Huaining section lies in the middle and south of Anhui Province, starting at the
Yueshan Town in the east and ending at Chezhousi, covering the total length of
31.830 km. This section is the main access to Gaojie Expressway for most towns of
Huaining County, and also a very important road leading to the tourist landscape of
Tianzhu Mountain in Anqing City. The affected towns of the county are as follows
Yueshan Town, Shijing Town, Duxiou Village, Huangdun Town, Sanqiao Town,
Zhonglian Village and Xiaoshi Town. The sensitive points are identified as 9 schools
and 3 hospitals, namely, Datang Primary School, Shijing Center Primary School,
Tashui Primary School, Xiusban Primary School, Sanqiao Primary School, Zhonglian
Primary School, Xiwang Middle School, Sisong Primary School, Xiaoshi Middle
School, Shijing Town Clinic, Huaining No.4 Hospital and Sanqiao Hospital.
G318 Huaining section traffic volume estimate(converted to medium sized vehicle):
the year 2005, 4606 no./d; the year 2010, 6393 no./d; the year 2020, 11 226no./d; the
year 2025, 14083 no./d.
The total cost of the rehabilitation of G3 18 Huaining section is estimated
RMB67,064,378 yuan. The project is planned to start in May 2002, and complete in
April 2004, covering the period of 24 month.
* Information 3- potential environmental impact of the project
(1 ) The noise and dust during the construction shall have negative effects on the
sensitive points along the highway. The construction shall bring inconvenience to the
nearby residents in their daily life. The residential waste and wastewater of the
construction sites shall affect environment. However the construction shall not affect
the rivers and irrigation system of farming land.
(2) The noise along the highway shall increase as the traffic volume increase once
the highway is in full operation after completion of the project. The top noise value of
daytime and nighttime in the year 2010, is estimated to reach 60.3dB (A) and 53.8dB
(A) in Shijing Town Clinic. Now the Clinic has equipped alufer windows and doors.
The noise of patient wards in daytime and nighttime is anticipated to be lower than
the limit value when the windows and doors facing the highway are closed. As for
50



Datang Primary School that has no facilities of noise barriers, some action needs to be
taken by building enclosing walls of 3m high and 30m long located at the place 5m
away from classrooms. Then traffic noise shall not affect the sensitive point. After the
improvement of the highway, traffic condition shall be better, dust shall be less and air
environment along the highway shall be cleaner.
* Information 4-Alleviation Plan of Environmental Impact
(I) Designing stage: select proper place for storing building materials and for
mixture, over lOOm away from sensitive points: carry out regular maintenance to
noise machines; equip spraying vehicle to control dust; improve greening belts on
both banks; enforce road drainage, slope protection and highway facilities like signs
of warning indication and road direction etc.
(2) construction stage: Building materials for road surface shall be centralized for
mixture and delivered by vehicle to each construction site. Strong noise machines
shall stop working at night in places where sensitive points are located. Spraying shall
be done in the places with much dust whenever needed. The planting of green belts of
highway shall be finished at the same time of the completion of major construction
work. The temporary wastewater treatment facilities shall be established for the
treatment of centralized residential wastewater and waste of construction site.
( 3 ) operation stage: Highway environmental management, environmental
supervision institutes and environmental monitoring report system shall be reinforced.
Highway environmental protection targets and environmental management plan shall
be established as well.
* Information 5-Conclusion of environmental impact assessment
The monitoring results of major sensitive points along the highway shows noise of
daytime and nighttime basically meet Class I set out in "Environment Noise Standard
in Urban Area" (GB3096-93) , except for that of 7 # Shijing Town Hospital slightly
exceed the limit. The monitoring of air environment shows TSP, NO2 and CO of
sensitive points along the highway below the limits of Class II set out in
"Environment Air Quality Standard".
The noise of construction and dust in the implementation of the project shall produce
certain effect on the sensitive points nearby, but the effect shall not last long and be
limited. Environment pollution shall be controlled through various measures on the
construction site and some action shall be taken to prevent from infectious disease,
local disease and AIDS. Simultaneously propaganda and education shall be
emphasized.
Although traffic noise and polluted tail air generated during the operational period
shall cause negative effect on the sensitive points along the highway, this impact shall
be within the limit range. The impact shall be controlled once the alleviation measures
are put into practice and green belts on both banks of the highway are built. Besides,
much effort has to be made on the environmental management and maintenance.

8. Conclusion
The proposed "rehabilitation" project of G3 18 Huaining section highway is one of the
highway maintenance component of Anhui Province proposed to apply for the World
Bank loan. The total length is 32km. This subproject is also one of the highway
improvement projects in the 0th five-year plan. This is the action to promote
transportation condition of poor areas in the west of Anhui Province and lay better
foundation for local economic development and flow of goods and people.
Huaining County per capita GDP accounts for 76% of the per capita GDP of the
province. Less developed transportation constrains the growth of local economy. The
improvement of the highway shall create more opportunities for local farmers to enter
the market and participate in the competition. More agriculture products and side
products shall appear in the market and more technical and scientific information shall
spread in the towns and villages. The construction of the project shall bring typical
social benefits and economic benefits. Investigation and public participation show
100% support the project, which means the project is so important to the local
development.
The civil works of the project shall implement within the range of existing reserved
subgrade, thus there is no requirement for land acquisition or demolition or
resettlement. According to the investigation and consultation with Huaining Cultural
Relics Administration Sector and Huaining Forestation Bureau, there are not any
objects requiring special protection along the highway such as natural protective
zones, cultural relics, historic sites, tourist landscapes, wild animals and plants.
The project implementation has sound social basis and natural environment. The
monitoring results of major sensitive points along the highway shows noise of
daytime and nighttime basically meet Class I set out in "Environment Noise
Standard in Urban Area" (GB3096-93 ), except for 7# Shijing Hospital that exceeds
the limit. The monitoring of air environment shows the daily concentration value of
TSP and hourly concentration value of NO and CO are both below the limit of Class
II set out in "Environment Air Quality Standard". The other ecological environment
and social environment shall not produce constraining impact.
During the implementation, noise and dust generated by the construction shall
produce certain effect on the sensitive points along the highway, but the impact is
temporary and limited to the acceptable level. The traffic noise and vehicle tail air
caused by the increase of traffic volume shall not much affect sensitive points along
the way. However during the operation period, environmental management,
supervision system reporting procedure of monitoring should be strengthened so as to
alleviate environmental impact to the lowest degree.
To sum up, this project would produce certain negative effects on the resident's life,
school's study and hospital's wards. However as long as the mitigation measures
proposed in EIA are actually taken, the unfavorable effects will be effectively
controlled and decreased to the lowest degree. Through the comprehensive
53



assessment, the social benefits and economical benefits are considerable. 100% of the
people along the highway support the project. Therefore this project is feasible in
conclusion.
