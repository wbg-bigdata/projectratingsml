IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ECONOMIC RECOVERY CREDIT
[CR. 2590-BUR]
BURKINA FASO
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Economic Recovery Credit (ERC) in
Burkina Faso, for which Credit 2590-BUR in the amount of SDR 18 million equivalent was approved on
March 29, 1994 and made effective on June 24, 1995.
The Credit was closed on June 30, 1995. The first and only tranche in the amount of SDR 18
million was released upon effectiveness. The credit was fully disbursed by July 29, 1994.
A substantial part of the program under the ERC was incorporated in the Structural Adjustment
Credit (Cr. 2281-BUR) as an additional condition for release of the final tranche. Both credits had the
same closing date and the preparation of the ICRs for both credits was begun during the Bank's completion
mission, April 17 to May 5, 1995. They are based on material in the project file, including the President's
Report, the Letter of Development Policy and related documents. The borrower contributed to preparation
of the ICRs by expressing views during the initial discussions as reflected in the mission's aide-m&noire
and commenting on an earlier draft of the report. Because this report is issued simultaneously with the ICR
for Cr.2281, and because of the formal linkage, cross references are made where appropriate. The
borrower provided comments that are included as an appendix to the ICR.
The ICR was prepared by Hans-Martin Boehmer, Country Operations Division, and reviewed by
Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Country Operations Division Chief, and Franz Kaps, Operations Adviser, West
Central Africa Departnent.






ECONOMIC RECOVERY CREDIT
[CR. 2590-BURl
BURKINA FASO
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    Immediately following the devaluation of the CFA franc on January 12, 1994, the Government of
Burkina Faso put in place a comprehensive package of reform measures. At the same time, the
Government updated and revised its medium-term program of structural reforms and began discussions
with the World Bank for an Economic Recovery Credit that was aimed at supporting this program. The
new country assistance strategy that was developed following the devaluation focused on: (i) human
resource development, (ii) natural resource management, and (iii) public and private institutional
development.
Statement of Project Objectives
2.    The main objective of the Economic Recovery Credit was to support Burkina's post-devaluation
adjustment program as outlined in the Government's Statement of Economic and Social Policy, whose main
objectives are private sector led growth and the alleviation of poverty. A second objective was to provide
support for measures taken in the aftermath of the devaluation to deepen the Government's adjustment
strategy. Given the historic nature of the devaluation, it was crucial to support the Government quickly to
provide the financial means necessary to implement the ambitious post-devaluation reform program.
Assessment of Outcomes
3.    Based on the Bank's ex-post evaluation norms, the ERC is classified as 'highly satisfactory" This
assessment is based on the following elements: (i) the program succeeded in restoring price stability
quickly following the devaluation; (ii) substantial progress was made in the areas of education and, to a
large extent, in health; and (iii) the price regime, which was temporarily controlled to limit the impact of the
devaluation, was quickly liberalized in its aftermath.
Key Lessons Learned
4.    This credit was a successful operation largely because of its simple design. The Burkinabe
economy had just experienced a major external shock in the form of the devaluation, and this credit helped
the Government adapt to the new environment. Reform measures had, by and large, been implemented in
advance, and as a result, the credit became effective soon after Board approval and was fully disbursed
shortly thereafter.
5.    Emergency Recovery Credits, and one-tranche operations in general, lend themselves well to
support policy reforms that depend on concrete policy decisions, where implementation is not a long
process. ERCs seem much less adequate to support reforms that must be implemented over an extended
period of time, such as banking reform, privatization programs, and improvements in the public financial
management system.






ECONOMIC RECOVERY CREDIT
ICR. 2590-BURl
BURKINA FASO
PART I -- PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.  BACKGROUND
(i)    Macroeconomic Setting
1.    Immediately following the devaluation of the CFA franc on January 12, 1994, the Govenmment of
Burkina Faso put in place a comprehensive package of reform measures.' At the same time, the
Government updated and revised its medium-term program of structural reforms in the third Policy
Framework Paper for 1994-96, and began discussions with the World Bank for an Economic Recovery
Credit that was aimed at supporting this program.
(iii)   Bank's Role
2.    The Bank followed closely the move of the Government as well as the other partners of the franc
zone towards the devaluation of the CFA franc and was therefore well positioned to provide immediate
support in its aftermath. Preparations for this credit began in tandem with the devaluation and were aimed
at ensuring the necessary conditions for a favorable supply response following the devaluation while
continuing IDA support to human resource development. The new country assistance strategy that was
developed following the devaluation focused therefore on: (i) human resource development, (ii) natural
resource management, and (iii) public and private institutional development.
B.    STATEMENT AND EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
(i)    Project Objectives
3.    The main objective of the Economic Recovery Credit was to support Burkina's post-devaluation
adjustment program as outlined in the Government's Statement of Economic and Social Policy, whose main
objectives are private sector led growth and the alleviation of poverty. A second objective was to provide
support for measures taken in the aftermath of the devaluation to deepen the Government's adjustnent
strategy. In addition to the devaluation of the CFA franc from 50 to 100 CFAF/1 FF, the major measures
were: (i) increasing the producer price of prime cotton by 40 percent, (ii) a program of measures to
attenuate the negative social effects of the devaluation, (iii) prudent demand management policies to reduce
absorption by the public sector and limit wage increases, and (iv) implement key measures to increase the
coverage and quality of primary education and health services in the context of a priority Action Plan for
1994.
For developments prior to the devaluation on January 12, 1994, please refer to the ICR for the Structual Adjustment
Credit (Cr. 2281-BUR).



2
4.     The overall program was already supported through a combination of adjustment (both SAC and
SECALs) and project lending, especially in human resource development and preservation of natural
resources. In addition to the first structural adjustment credit, which provided general support to the
Government's adjustment program since 1991, policy reforms in the agricultural sector were implemented
under the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (Cr. 2381 -BUR), the privatization program was supported
by the Private Sector Assistance Project (Cr. 2472-BUR), public financial management reforms were
deepened under the Public Institutional Development Project (Cr. 2378-BUR), and a better resource
allocation in transport and education was achieved with support from the Transport Sector Adjustment
Credit (Cr. 2332-BUR) and the Fourth Education Project (Cr. 2244-BUR).
(ii)    Evaluation of Objectives
5.     Given the historic nature of the devaluation, it was crucial to support the Government quickly to
provide the financial means necessary to implement the ambitious post-devaluation reform program. At the
same time, given the on-going adjustment program that began in 1991 and was still supported by numerous
IDA operations, reforms under the ERC had to build on the progress made earlier. With its focus on
human resource development and private sector led growth, the ERC was fully consistent with the on-going
reforms. Thus, both objectives were fully appropriate.
C.   ACHIEVEMENT OF MAJOR OBJECTIVES
6.    As discussed below, the objectives of the ERC have been achieved. In particular, the main
objective of the devaluation was to restore external competitiveness, which required that the expected initial
surge in inflation would be brought under control effectively within a few months. This was achieved and
the long-term sustainability of gains in external competitiveness seem assured. Other specific reforms were
intended to reinforce the Govermment's commitment to the adjustment process begun under SAC I and were
based on the overall program as described in the Policy Framework Paper for 1994-96.
7.     Macroeconomic Objectives. The principal macroeconomic objectives of the program as outlined in
the Statement of Economic and Social Development Policies was to: (i) increase real GDP growth to at
least 3.3 percent; (ii) limit consumer price increases to 31 percent; and (iii) reduce the current account
deficit by US$80 million to about US$370 million in 1994. Although the Government did not achieve its
GDP growth objective, the macroeconomic performance in 1994 was solid and substantial progress was
made in restoring macroeconomic balance.2 The reforms put in place during 1994 have thus built the
foundation on which growth is expected to accelerate to around 5 percent per year over the medium term.
8.     Social Policy Measures and Development of Human Resources. The devaluation provided a
unique opportunity for the BurkinabW Government to recommit itself to the priority sectors of health and
2   More details on the macroeconomic performance in 1994, as well as during previous years, can be found in the ICR for
the Structural Adjustment Credit (Cr. 2281 -BUR).

education. It did this in the form of a Priority Action Plan for Primary Education and Health.3 However, it
was also anticipated that the devaluation would have a significant negative impact on the standards of
living for the urban population. Thus, in tandem with the devaluation, the Government introduced: (i)
temporary price controls on kerosene and school supplies, and (ii) limited increases in prices for certain
basic consumer goods through lower taxation. Fully in line with the conditions for credit effectiveness, the
Government removed all price controls prior to April 30, 1994, with the agreed exceptions of petroleum
products, public utility rates and school supplies. In addition, the Government introduced, as anticipated, a
national price list for essential and generic drugs.
9.    As regards the agricultural sector, the price for rice remained regulated, which was agreed to by
IDA in view of the reform measures anticipated to take place under the Agricultural Sector Adjustment
Credit. In addition, to benefit local agricultural production, producer prices of cotton were raised by 40
percent from CFAF80/kg to CFAF112/kg, immediately following the devaluation. This resulted in a real
producer price increase of just over 10 percent. Following a substantial improvement in the financial
performance of the cotton parastatal (SOFITEX), during 1994/95, the Govermnent decided to increase the
producer price further to 140 CFAF/kg, bringing the real price increase following the devaluation to about
40 percent.
D.  MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROGRAM
10.   There were no major factors affecting the prograrn, as it was a quickly executed program in
response to a major shock to the economy.
E.    PROGRAM SUSTAINABILITY
11.   The reforms introduced in the immediate aftermath of the January 1994 devaluation are likely to
lead to a sustained improvement of Burkina Faso's external competitiveness. In the social sectors,
Government commnitmnent remains strong-the objectives set out in the Priority Action Plan for Primary
Education and Health have thus far been achieved-and the outlook for a continued successful
implementation of the Action Plan are good. In agriculture, the sustainability of the reforms is not yet
assured. Despite the price increases for cotton introduced following the devaluation, producer prices in
Burkina Faso have remained relatively low compared with its neighboring countries.
F.  BANK PERFORMANCE
12.   Preparation for this credit began in conjunction with the preparation of the devaluation of the CFA
franc. Therefore, a well planned post-devaluation program of immediate actions was already available
prior to first formal discussions of the ERC. As a result, internal processing of this credit proceeded
unusually quickly, taking a mere two months to Board approval. The rapid processing, however, was the
result of a recognition of the historical importance of the devaluation, which allowed similar credits for
most CFA franc zone countries to be prepared and presented to the Board virtually at the same time.
Because of the quick disbursing nature of this credit, and the timely implementation of agreed measure, no
supervision mission took place. However, a joint Bank/Fund mission supervised key components of the

post-devaluation program in May 1994 during which the implementation of the program was found to be
broadly satisfactory.
G.  BORROWER PERFORMANCE
13.   The borrower performed well under the program. Policy actions were taken as planned and the
program experienced no significant delays in its execution. All legal covenant were complied with.
H.    ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
14.   Based on the Bank's ex-post evaluation norms, the ERC is classified as "highly satisfactory". This
assessment is based on the following elements: (i) the program succeeded in restoring price stability
quickly following the devaluation; (ii) substantial progress was made in the areas of education and, to a
large extent, in health; and (iii) the price regime, which was temporarily controlled to limit the impact of the
devaluation, was quickly liberalized in its aftermath.
1.    FUTURE OPERATIONS
15.   Future operations are the key to the sustainability of the adjustment program. While basic
macroeconomic performance is monitored under the Fund's ESAF program, sectoral achievements hinge on
the conclusion of existing projects as well as the next generation of projects. The reform agenda is clearly
not finished in Burkina. This is particularly the case for the agricultural sector where reforms are still
continued under the first sectoral adjustment credit, but will be deepened under a proposed second
operation which will focus on eliminating remaining barriers in rice, sugar, and cotton, to stimulate a strong
supply response.
16.   Most importantly, the private sector still has to become the engine of economic growth. A first
step will be the a proposed FY96 mining sector project. It will further improve the incentive framework for
foreign investment in the mining sector, which holds the promise of substantially boosting Burkina's mining
production. Ultimately, however, the private sector can only become the driving force behind Burkina's
development if the Government is fully committed to privatization of state enterprises and a strong private
banking sector, while substantially improving the management of the public finances to provide adequate
support to the activities of the private sector. These areas of reform would be the focal points of a
proposed FY97 second structural adjustment credit.
J.    KEY LESSONS LEARNED
16.   This credit was a successful operation to a large extent because of the simple nature of its design.
The Burkinabe economy had just experienced a major external shock in the form of the devaluation, and
this credit was purely designed to help the Government adapt to the new environment. Reform measures
had, by and large, been implemented in advance as they had been prepared in conjunction with the
devaluation. As a result, the credit became effective soon after Board approval and was fully disbursed
shortly thereafter.
17.   Emergency Recovery Credits, and one-tranche operations in general, lend themselves well to
support policy reforms that depend on concrete policy decisions, where implementation is not a longer
process. ERCs seem much less adequate to support reforms that must be implemented over a extended

ECONOMIC RECOVERY CREDIT
[CR. 2590-BURl
BURKINA FASO
APPENDIX A - MISSIONS'S AIDE- MEMOIRE
Burkina Faso
Rapport d'Achevement
du Premier Credit d'Ajustement Structurel (CAS I)
et du Credit d'Appui a la Relance Economique (CARE)
Mission du 17 avril au 9 mai 1995
Aide-Memoire
Une mission de la Banque mondiale conduite par Monsieur Hans-Martin Boehmer, Economiste, Division
des Operations, Departement de l'Afrique du Centre-Ouest, a sejourne au Burkina Faso du 17 avril au 9
mai 1995 en vue de la preparation du rapport d'achevement du premier Credit d'Ajustement Structurel
(Cr. 228 1-BUR), et du Credit d'Appui a la Relance Economique (Cr. 2590-BUR). La mission a travaille
en etroite collaboration avec le Secretariat Technique Permanent du Programme d'Ajustement Structurel et
en coordination avec Monsieur Mbida-Essama et Madame Berthe, qui se sont rendus au Burkina dans le
cadre de la preparation de la deuxieme Revue des Depenses Publiques. La mission a beneficie du soutien
du personnel de la Mission Residente; le Representant Resident, Monsieur Albert Osei a pris part a toutes
les reunions importantes avec la mission.   La mission exprime toute sa gratitude a Monsieur Joseph
Sirima et a son equipe pour leur assistance dans 1'examen de cette premiere experience d'ajustement
structurel au Burkina Faso.
Evaluation Globale
La mission a passe en revue les resultats et les lecons issus du premier Credit d'Ajustement Structurel
(CAS I) et du Credit d'Appui a la Relance Economique (CARE), bases sur les objectifs fixes dans la Lettre
de Politique de Developpement du Gouvernement du 17 mai 1991 du CAS I et de la Declaration de
Politique Economique et Sociale du 7 mars 1994 du CARE. Les principaux objectifs et les mesures
specifiques a mettre en oeuvre sont resumes dans l'annexe I.
L'experience generale et les resultats du premier CAS du Burkina Faso sont mitigees. On peut noter un
progres significatif en matiere de liberalisation et d'amelioration de l'environnement externe, de levee des
controles des prix, de reduction de la participation du secteur public dans les activites economiques
productives et d'orientation des politiques publiques vers les secteurs de l'education et de la sant.
En revanche, les progres realises dans le domaine de la gestion du secteur public et d'encouragement a
l'investissement prive sont moins encourageants que prevus. De plus, le programme d'execution du plan
de reforme a connu des retards importants dus, en partie a la transition politique de 1992/93 mais aussi a
une capacite limitee de mise en oeuvre et une progression lente des operations de suivi (voir para 5. ci-
dessous).



18
Conception du Cr6dit d'Ajustement
Etant donne qu'il s'agissait du premier CAS, il etait necessaire de mettre en oeuvre une large gamme de
r6formes pour faire passer l'economie du Burkina Faso d'un etat de forte predominance du secteur public a
un etat oii le secteur prive deviendrait le principal agent de croissance. Le SAC I a e  deliberement concu
pour etre une operation "parapluie" dont les differentes composantes seraient par la suite appuyees par
des missions de suivi. Les operations directement issues du CAS I et ensuite du CARE, furent le Credit
d'Ajustement du Secteur Agricole (PASA), le Credit d'Ajustement du Secteur des Transports (PASECT),
le Projet d'Appui a l'Administration (PAA), le Projet d'Assistance au Secteur Prive (PASP), et le 4eme
Projet Education.
Vu l'ampleur des reformes ndcessaires a cette periode, une telle approche semblait prometteuse bien qu'elle
presente certains risques. L'analyse retrospective confirme l'adequation entre les domaines de reforme et
les objectifs gen6raux du programme. Cependant le succes de la mise en oeuvre des composantes
particulieres dependait fortement du respect des delais prevus pour l'execution successive des operations.
Le Gouvemement a signifie que pendant la preparation et ensuite l'execution de diverses composantes, trop
peu de temps avait e  consacre aux discussions sur (i) les grands objectifs des reformes, (ii) les differentes
options possibles, et (iii) les modalites specifiques en particulier dans le domaine de l'entreprise publique et
de la reforme bancaire, avaient e  de trop courtes durees. Le Gouvemement eut aussi l'impression que la
mise en oeuvre et le decaissement des tranches avaient ete retardes du fait de divergences d'opinions sur sa
responsabilite dans l'application des reformes.  En outre, le Gouvernement percevait le credit comme
moyen d'atteindre les objectifs economiques auxquelles il s'etait engag6, alors qu'il lui semblait que la
Banque mondiale suivait une logique plus legaliste et orient6e vers l'execution.
Le programme d'ajustement du Gouvemement avait deux objectifs principaux: (i) r6former la gestion du
secteur public au plan financier pour ameliorer l'utilisation des ressources et les concentrer vers des
secteurs economiques et sociaux prioritaires; (ii) encourager l'investissement prive par des reformes du
secteur public et du secteur bancaire, ainsi que par la liberalisation du commerce, des prix et du cadre
reglementaire.
Ameinoration de la Gestion du Secteur Public
Gestion des Deenses
Ce domaine de reformes fut trds tot appuye par une Revue des Depenses Publiques qui fit de nombreuses
recommandations dans les domaines du Programme d'Investissement Public, de la Gestion de
l'Information, du Developpement Institutionnel et de la Gestion des Depenses. Bien qu'il y eut initialement
des progres dans (i) la reaffectation des depenses aux secteurs prioritaires, (ii) la reduction de la masse
salariale du secteur public, (iii) I'elimination des projets d'investissement non-economiques, la gestion des
depenses publiques ne s'est guere amelioree. Aucune des recommandations relatives au Programme
d'Investissement Public (PIP) n'a ete executee et le PIP n'est toujours pas un instrument utile de
planification. La gestion financiere qui est actuellement soutenue par le PAA, ne connait pas encore
d'amelioration sensible.  Le Gouvemement a estime que les objectifs dans ce domaine de r6formes
n'avaient ete definis suffisamment clairement au depart et ne ciblaient pas l'ensemble du systeme de gestion
financiere, mais plutot ses composantes.



19
L'evolution .des depenses publiques pendant la periode 1992-94 est l'objet de la deuxieme Revue des
D6penses Publiques qui est actuellement en preparation.
Secteurs Prioritaires
Des progres importants ont e  realises dans les secteurs de la Sante et de I'Education, notamnment depuis
I'adoption d'un Programme d'Actions Prioritaires pour I'Education Primaire et la Sante dans le cadre du
CARE, qui a ensuite et integre sous forme d'arnendement au CAS 1. Les efforts du Gouvernement ont e
particulierement efficaces dans l'introduction des medicamnents generiques et le recrutement d'instituteurs
supplementaires dans les ecoles primaires. L'affectation budgetaire au secteur de I'education semble avoir
baisse ces dernieres annees, mais une analyse plus detaillee devra attendre les resultats de la deuxieme
Revue des Depenses Publiques.
Creation d'un Environnement pour l'Investissement et la Croissance du Secteur Prive
Bien qu'un certain nombre de reformes aient ete prises pour ameliorer 1'environnement du secteur prive,
l'investissement prive et la croissance n'ont pas encore donne les resultats escomptes. Le Gouvernement a
exprime le point de vue selon lequel les reformes en ce domaine avaient plutot pour but de desengager
l'Etat des secteurs productifs de 1'economie que de faire comprendre comment augmenter la productivite et
l'efficacite du secteur prive. Trop peu de temps avait e  consacre au developpement d'une approche
coherente de la privatisation, basee sur une comprehension par toutes les parties des objectifs recherches et
des options possibles.
Reforme de l'Entreprise Publique
Des progres ont e  faits en matiere de restructuration des entreprises du secteur public et de reduction de la
participation de l'Etat dans les secteurs productifs de l'economie. Douze entreprises ont e  privatisees ou
liquidees au cours du programme et les subventions budgetaires de l'Etat aux entreprises publiques ont e
reduites. Une autre liste de dix-neuf entreprises a privatiser a e  approuvee par le Parlement. Toutefois,
l'impact de cette reforme sur le transfert des biens de production au secteur prive afin de stimuler
investissement et croissance est reste faible jusqu'a present. Selon le Gouvemement, on aurait trop mis
l'accent sur la reduction du r6le du secteur public et pas assez sur l'accroissement de l'efficacite et des
activites productives des entreprises.
Reforme du Secteur Bancaire
L'objectif de reduire la participation de l'Etat dans chaque banque a un maximum de 25% a et a peu pres
atteint. Les banques ont par ailleurs fait l'objet d'un programme de restructuration par un nettoyage de
leurs portefeuilles et abandon des prets non-performants. Le BRCB a atteint son objectif de recouvrer 30%
des prets recouvrables.  L'intermidiation financiere et la mise a disposition de ressources pour
l'investissement priv6 n'ont cependant pas atteint le niveau souhaite. Les banques continuent d'accumuler
d'importantes liquidites et n'accordent que des montants limites au financement de l'investissement prive.
Une analyse plus detaillee de l'evolution du systeme bancaire au Burkina Faso depuis la mise en oeuvre du
programme d'ajustement a fait l'objet d'un rapport actuellement diffuse aupres du Gouvernement.
Reforme Reglementaire



20
ll fut particulierement difficile d'atteindre un veritable consensus sur les actions a mener dans ce domaine,
notamment en matiere de Code du Travail et de fixation des prix des produits petroliers. Le Gouvernement
a jugd ce secteur particulierement difficile car il a fallu du temps a toutes les parties pour apprendre a
travailler avec les nouvelles institutions democratiques. Alors que des progres etaient intervenus en matiere
de liberalisation du Code du Travail, certaines autorites gouvemementales ont introduit des restrictions
additionnelles qui ont augmente les charges patronales. Tandis que l'on s'attendait a certains de ces
problemes lors de la phase de conception du programme, et que le Gouvemrnement s'6tait engage a
supprimer les barrieres structurelles a la creation d'emplois, la necessite de reformes specifiques n'tait pas
suffisamment claire pour arriver a convaincre toutes les parties impliquees dans le processus politique.
Lecons apprises
Comme premiere operation d'ajustement pour le Burkina Faso, le cr6dit avait e  concu pour couvrir une
tres large gamme de reformes. La mise en oeuvre du programme dependait fortement des operations de
suivi. Les operations futures au Burkina devraient davantage ere consacrees aux domaines restant,
notamment en developpant un systeme complet de gestion des depenses du secteur public et en appuyant la
croissance de l'investissement prive sans surcharger la capacite de mise en oeuvre limitee des institutions
publiques. Tandis que le Gouvemement etait engag6 dans l'aboutissement des objectifs globaux du
programme, des details de mise en oeuvre restaient insuffisamment definis. Une meilleure compr6hension
de toutes les options possibles aiderait le Gouvemement a renforcer a l'avenir sa capacite a soutenir les
reformes au sein de groupes qui pourraient autrement s'y opposer.
Prochaines etaucs
La mission a discute avec le STP-PAS des exigences et du programme pour la preparation de la
contribution de l'Emprunteur au rapport d'achevement. L'evaluation devrait inclure en particulier:
1) une presentation des objectifs , de la conception et de la mise en oeuvre du projet;
2) une 6valuation de la performance de l'emprunteur durant l'evolution et l'exdcution du
programme, avec un accent particulier sur les lecons tirees pouvant Wer utiles dans I'avenir; et;
3) une evaluation de la performance de la Banque et de tous co-financiers pendant l'6volution et
I'execution du projet, y compris 1'efficience des relations entre l'emprunteur, la Banque et les co-financiers,
en mettant I'accent sur les lecons tirees.
La mission a precise que la contribution de l'emprunteur (10 pages au maximum) sera annexee telle queUe
au Rapport d'Achevement du Projet. La Banque devra rediger un projet de rapport dans les 2 a 3 prochains
mois et le soumettre au Gouvemement pour commentaires. Par la suite, 1'emprunteur devra transmettre sa
contribution a la Banque.

A.    GENERALITES
i)    Cadre macro-ocOnOmicUe
1     Avant 1988, les autorites du Burkina Faso avaient dtc contraintes, en raison de la
faiblcsse du revenu national et de l'ipargne priv6e, it mnettre en oeuvre une politique de
developpemrent fondee sur la predominance du secteur publique. C'est ainsi que la part diu
secteur public roprescntait plus de la mouiu6 du total de la formation brute du capital fixe.
L'xconomic avait alors connu une croissance relativement soutenue r6sultant: i) de l'expansion
de la consommation du secteur public et de ses depenses d'investissement et ii) d'une forte
croissance du sectcur agricole (6,1% par an au cours de la periode 1982-1988) due a des
conditions climanques favorables et a la mise en culturc de terres Jiberees depuis oeu de
l'onchocercose. Le secteur manufacturier, malgre un degre do protectionnisme assez
important, a cnregistr6 de moins bonrnes performances. Des facteurs strucrurels tels que la
faiblesse des competcnces techniques et les couts elevis de I'energie et du transport ne lui ont
pas permis permetraient pas d'attcindre les niveau de croissance escompt6s. En ourre des
mesures tr6s strictes de contrrle des prix et du commerce ont nui a la competitivite. Au cours
de la periode 1989-1990, la aibLe pluviometrie et l'incapaLcitt i maintenir les depenses
publiques au niveau eleve qu'elles avaienr atteint, ont rameri la croissance rcelle du PIB a 1%
en moyenne.
2.    Le Burkina dependait, et depend toujours. de laIde dtrangere pour financer ia plupart
des investissements publics ct urie partie de la consommation. Au cours de la pcriode 1986-
1990, les d6caissements nets de prcts ot de dons dans le cadre de l'aide publique aux
investissemcnts oat represente en moyenne pres de 5 % du PIB. Une aurre tranche de 4 % cn
moyenne du PIB corrcspondait aux contributions des bailleurs de fonds au tiTre de I'assistance
techxique et de l'aide alinientaire et i celles des organisations non gouvemementales (ONG).
L epargne etait egalement forremcnt tributaire des envois de fonds des ravailleurs expatriis
danas les pays voisins, qui representaient en moyenne 6 % du PIB au cours de certe mime
pcriode.
3.    Si les d6s6quilibres economiqucs n'avaient pas arttint des proportions inqui6tantes, la
precarite de la situation etait manifeste. Aussi, le Gouvemement a-t-il decide de s'adresser a la
Banque et au Fonds avant quc les rialites economiqucs ne nacessitent la mise en oeuvre de
mesures de redressement draconiennes et couiteuses. Le dialoguc sur la gestion economique,
arnorce en 1988 dans le cadre de la prepararion du premier mdmoranidum economiquC, s'cst
acc6lere lorsque la conjoncture s'est d6t6rioric en 1989. Apres des travaux preparatoircs qui
oat eu lieu en 1989, un avant-projet de Document-cadre de politique economique a fait l'objet
dc discussions dans des assembldes publiques organisees vers le milieu de l'annie 1990, pour
aboutir, au debut de I'annee 1991, au premier Document-cadre pour la periode de 1991-1993.
Le Gouvernement a pr6sentd ce document aux Conseils de la Banque et du F.M.I. au debut de
I'aancc 1991 et le premier Credit d'Ajustement Structurel a dtc approu'v6 par la Banque en juin
1991.

ii)    Cadre socio-pohtique
4.    Pendant la periode au cours de laquelle la politique de developpement s'appuyait
essentiellement sur le secteur public, le role de l'administration avait pris enormement
d!importancC et les agents de l'Etat participaient a tous les aspects de gestion de l'conomie.
Une certaine bureaucratie s'etait alors constiruee et avait pns de plus en plus de poids.
5.    Les transformations du systeme politique et les profondes reformes institutionnelles,
marquees notammcnt par la premiere election presidentielle de 1991 et les elections
legislatives qui ont suivi au milieu de 1992, devaiect aussi se traduire par le desengagement
de l'Etat de la gestion directe de lIeconomie. Si aux plus hauts niveaux du Gouvernement on
notait uni changement trds net d'orientationi, une ferme volonte de transformer P'tconornie, et
une profonde comprehension des changements qu'il fallait ndccssairement apporter a la
fonction publique, on notait galeznent une reiaLive incrtic dans les comportements de certains
agents de l'Etat. Les efforts de scnsibilisation et de mobilisation entrepris n'ont pas suffi.
6.    En raison du climat politique en pleine evolution, il y a eu uiie rapide succession de
ministres a plusicurs postes cles, cc qui a compliquc la mise en oeuvre des rcfornes. Ces
reformes ont dtc cncore ralenries par une fonction publique qui ntavait pas eu le temps de
s'adapter a son nouveau rnandat. Ainsi, alors que des decisions prises au niveau politique
pour modifier le rtlc du Gouvernement et lib6raliser I'dconomie 6taient concretisdes dans des
textes rdglementaires. leur application, qui d6pendait des agents de l'Etat, a connu des retards
considerables.
iii)    Role de la Bano,ue
7.    Jusqu'au lancement du programme d'ajustement structurel, la Banque n'avait joue
qu'un rtle limite dans le processus de developpement du Burkina Faso. concentrant ses
investissements dans les secteurs de l'Aiculture et du Transport. Les relations entre la
Banque et le Burkina Faso s'etaient ddteriorees au point qu'aucun nouveau credit n'a ete
approuve en 1986 et en 1987. Les relations se sont nettement amrliordes et les operations de
pret ont repris en 1988 apris que les pouvoirs publiques aient affiche leur volonte
d'enLreprendre de reformer en profondeur les institutions et le role de l'Etat dans la gestion de
l'econornie. Les pourparlers concermant les premniFres operations d'ajustement ont commencte
en 1-989. Apres plusicurs seines de discussions preliminaires, les negociations ont commnence
en mai 1991. La strat6gie d'aide de la Banquc visait a l'6poque A: i) souterAir les actions
cruciales visant A attenucr les contraintes a long termne au d6velopperrent economique et
social; ii) aider le Gouvcrnement a instaurer un cadre reglementaire propice a I'essor du
sec.eur prive, et iii) aidcr Ic Gouvernement a mieux gcrer les ressources publiques.
8.    Dans le meme temps, il etait envisage dans le cadre de cette stategie d'accroitre de
mani6re substantielle le volume des prets de la Banque au Burk-ina. De 1985 a 1990, le
voluxre annuel des prdts a ete d'environ 20 millions de dollars; il a quadrupIl dans la periode
1990 a 1995 alors que Ic montant annuel moyen des nouveaux preEs a depass6 80 millions de
dollars.

B.     DESCRIPTION ET EVALUATION DES OBJECTIFS
i)     - Obiectifs diu pro e
9.    Le principal objectif du premier Credit d'Ajustaemnt Stucturel (CAS I) (Cr. 2281 -
BM de 60 rillions de DTS, signtx le 5 juillet 1991 ct en=  en vigucur le 17 septembre 1991)
etait d'appuyer le programme global d'ajustement du Burkina Paso decnt dans le premier
Document-Cadre de Politiquc Economique (D.C.P.E) de 1991-1993, avec pour but
d'amrliorer la gestion des ressources publiques ct de mettre en place des mesures incitatives
au ddveloppement du secteur prive. De facoa plus precise:
* a)    le volet gestion du secteur public consistait entre autres A redistribuer les
dotatioms budg,taires courantes en faveur du developpement des ressources humaines,
a preparer un programme de r6fo:r.: de la gestioa de la foncrion publique et .
amrliorer la programrnation des investissements; et
. b)    le volet mesures incitatives pour le secteur prive se concentrait sur la
restructuration des entreprises publiques et du secteur bancaire, ainsi que sur la
reforme du commerce et du cadre reglcmcntaire.
10.   A la suite de la devaluation du franc CFA. le 12 janvier 1994. le Conseil a approuve le
Crddit d'Appui a la Relance Econamique (CARE) (Cr. 2590-BUR) le 10 mars 1994, qui a
pour objet d'aider le Gouvemement dans ses efforts de reforrne en vue de favoriser une
croissance dont le secteur privc serait le principal agent et d'all6ger la pauvrete.  Les
pracipales mesures appuyees par cc credit comprenaient:
- c)    une augmentation de l'ordre de 40 % du prix a la production du coton de
premier choix,
* d)    une sene de mesures pour attrnuer les effets sociaux negatifs de la devaluation;
. e)    une gestion rigourcuse de la demande de facon a reduire la consornmation
publique -t a limiter les hausses salariates; et
* f)    1'cxecution de mesures essentielles en vue d'accroitre la couverrure et la qualite
de L1enseignement primairc et des services de santc dans le cadre d'un Plan d'action
prioritwire pour l'education et ia sante. Certe composante a et6 formellement intdgr6e
dans le CAS r. en tant que condition additionnelle au decaissement de la troisierme
ranche, atin de relier clairement ]es mesures prises a la suite de la devaluadon aux
r6formes lancecs dans le cadre du CAS I.
II.   De par sa conception, le premier Credit d'Ajustement Structurel s'inscrivait dans le
droit fil de la strategie d'aide-pays de la Banque et du Docurnent-cadre de politique
economique prepare en etroite collaboration entre Les autorit6s burkinab4, le Fonds monetaire
international et la Banque mondiale.

12.   L'aidc de la Banque S'articulait autour d'une combinaison de Credit d'Ajustement
Structurel (CAS/CARE et Credits d'Ajustement Sectonrel ) et des Prct-Projets, notamment
pour le developpemrcnt de ressources humaines et la preservation des ressources na=relles.
Plusieurs projets aont etc specifiquement conrus pour venir etaycr le CAS I: des rdformes dans
le secteur agricolc, qui devaient etre mises en ocuvre dans le cadre du Credit d'Ajustement du
Secteur Ag cole (PASAy; le programme de privatisations, appuye par le Projet d'Assistancc
au Secteur Pnve; les rforrmes de la gestion des Finances Publiques, qui devaient etre
approfondies dans le cadre du Projet d'Appui a 1'Addministration (PAA); ct l'am6lioration de
l'affectarion des ressources aux transports et a I'dducation qui devait dtre realisee grace au
Credit d'Ajustement du Sectcur des Transports (PASECT) et au Quatrieme projet Education
(ED IV).
ii)    Evaluation des objectii
13.   Avant le lancement du processus d'ajustement stucturel, la rdparnition des ddpenses
publiques n'etait guere de nature a favoriser les objectifs 61ementaircs de developpement et le
secteur prive fonctionnait dans un cadre cornportant de fortes distorsions et contraintes. Les
deux objectifs du CAS I eraient donc tout indiqucs. puisque les dexx secteurs devaient
simultanement faire l'objct de reformes profondes.
14.   Le Credit d'Appui a la Relance Economique est venu dans le sillage de la devaluation,
qui, de son c6te, avait offert au Gouvernement une excellente occasion d'approfondir ses
efforts de reforme. II etait judicieux de vouloir s'assurer que les incitations crzees par la
d6valuation scraient rdpercut6es au producteur. En meme temps, 1'acceleration des efforts
dans les secteurs de lenseignement prirmaare ct de la sante etait tout a fait conforme A la
straEtgie de developpemenr que le Burkina s'&tait donnce dans le cadre du CAS I.
C.     REALISATION DES PRINCIPAUX OBJECTIFS
15.   Les objcctifs du CAS I ont ete globalement atteints. En particulier, Les reformes dans
le domaine de la lib6ralisation du commerce et des prnx ont ete significatives, l'assainissement
des financcs publiques et le rerablissemene des cquilibres budgetaires se realiscnt
conformn-ient aux objcctifs et des efforts ont ete consentis pour que les secteurs prionitaires
de l'enseignernent pr-nmaire cE de la sante soient au centre des preoccupations. Les retards
releves concernent la misc on oeuvre du programme de privatisation des entreprises publiques
et des banques. Ce programme representait, dans sa conception, une dimarche rationnelle
mais tres ambitieuse pour parvenir aux objectifs recherchcs.
1)     )biectifs macro-economniguc't 
16.   D'encree de jeu, le programme d'ajustement du Gouvernement a ete appuy6 a la fois
par la Banque. par le Fonds ainsi que par divers partenaires du Burkina Faso. Les mesures
mises cn oeuvre dans ce cadre ont permis de stabiliser 1'coaomnie, apres la forte datirioration
de la periode 1988-1989. Mais les difficultes prc6demnmient citees dans la mises en oeuvre
des reforrnes insriEurionnelles et la longueur du processus de d6mocratisation avaient entraine
des derapages importants du progranune macro.-conomique et n'avaient pas pernis
d!acnualiser, pour 1992, le Document Cadre d& Politique Economique (D.C.P.E). I1 a fallu
attendre le debut de I'anncc 1993 pour que le deuxieme Document-cadre soit pret et, depuis
lors, des mises a jour annuelles du Document-cadre ont permis de faire le point sur les progres
realises dans le retablissemenc d'=u environnement macro-economique viable. L'adhesion au

1 7    Reitablissement de fa croissance du P1B. Le programme d'ajusteifent a jetd les bases
d'une croissance durable. Apres urne periode de croissance du PIB de lordre de 4%  sur la
periode 1983-88, cette derniere a It6 rompuc au cours des anndcs 1989-1990 confunant la
fragilite des bases de la croissance. Le premier Document-cadre de politique economiquz
s'etai: fixe pour but un taux de croissance reelle moycone du PIB dc 4 %, ce qui aucait
rcpr6sente des gains reels par habitant. Grice A une pluviomete tris favorable, la croissance
avait et6 de 6%  en 1991 La croissance sest maintenue cn 1992 ( 2,5%,), rnais en 1993 la
situation economnique s'ctait a nouveau dcctrior6e. Les mesurcs prises dans le cadr- du
prograr3xe s'&3aient rdveIees insuf,isantes notamment en raison du taux de cha-nge pratique et
qui pernalisair fortement la produc:ctior locale. La dev,luation de janvier 1994 a permis
d'.:ixniner cet handicap er, apros une courte pe(riode de stagnation due a I'attentisme des
opTrareurs econorique, le Burkina Faso a rctrouv6 le chernin dc la croissance. Elle a r;pris,
malgr6 des pr6cipiraEions trrs dcfavorabies ert 1994 et ciUe devrait se situer. a moyen termne, a
plus de 5 % par an en movenne.
8. Reducrion cdu deficit budgeraire. Un >hement clef du programmc; consistait a reduire le
d5ficit 'oudgdtairc global et a r6g[er les amreifrs de pal;rnent interieurs et exterieurs. Des
progres appr6ciables or.t ete realises en 1991, et te d:1.-cit a ete plus faiblc que prvu- Les
recertes ont largement depasse leurs objectifs, ce qui a pcrmis une reduction bcaucoup plus
marquee que prevue des amreres intericuxs, mais des rerards dans les n6gociations portant sur
La restructuration avec les creanciers bilateraux ont eu pour effet de maintenir les arriar6s
exteineurs bien au-dcssus des niveaux envisages. Au debut de I'anrne 1992. la gesnron des
finances publiques s'est fo-rtcment ddgzrad6e, en partic en raison du processus de
dernocratisacion. Les efforts d6ploy6s par lc Gouveernement pour accroltre les recetrcs et
resserrcr lcs depezises en vue de rectifier la situation au zours du deuxicme trimestre de l'ann6c
ont ^r. concrecarr6s par des faceeurs exogcnes, cormne une pluviomctrie detavorable et la
chure des cours du cocon.  La nouveau programme pour 1993, appuv6 par la Facilitd
d'aju.srement structurel renforc diu F  I.JI., SiesT efforc: 4e partir des acquis de la fin de i'annmc
1992 Dour amdliorer la situation des finances publiques. En 1993, les reccrtes mobilisees sont
routefois restees en degA des objectifs fixes. en raisoa du ralenrissement des aciviteis ,t de la
quasi szagnarion du PIB (-0.8%  en volume par rapport a1992) et des dificultes rencontreies
dans la mise en oeuvre de Ia rfforrne fiscale. L'introduction de la TVA des le budger 1993 a
ere :rop hativc, et le niouveau tarif douanier, malgre diminution dcs categories de rauLx er une
dispersion moindre dcs taux, n'a pas ete appliquc sans une difiicultes. A partir de 1994 ces
mdzies reformes, cornblnees au reitorcement des regies de recettes. ont permis d'amnliarer le
nPvea.: des rccertes fiscales et, en ' 995. les previsions budgetaires scront netternent depassees.
1 9    Des efforts ont e alement e  faits pour maatriser ies depenses et limiter leur croissance
a des niveaux compatibl_s avec ceiui des recertcs budgetaires. Au cours de la penode 1991-
1 993, le deficit budgeraire global (base engagement. hors dons) s'est adanmoins dcgrad~ en
raison: i) de ['enreyistrement effectif, e: de rnanire exhaustive, de toutes les depenses de
l'Erat tellzs les consommations d'eau , d'6lectricite et dc tdlephone qui ric I'taient pas
toujours auparavant, ii) de l'inscription au budget de I'Etat d'un important volume de
depenses pour la restructuration et/ou la liquidation des entreprises publiques et des banques,
et iii) de la nrecessire d'au-menter les credits pour les secteurs prioritaires que sont
l'dducation, la sante et 1'entretien des infrastructures routieres. En 1994. malgrd des recettes
inf&ieuras au rniveau escompte. ce deficit a et contenu dans les limnites du programme. Hors
op&rations dc restructuration, le deficit a dtd reduit a 1,4% du PIB en 1 994 et les prcvisions de
cloture mcdiquent sa quasi disparition -,n 1995. alors que cellc-ci n'6tait pas attcndue pour
avant 1997.

depenses publiques, realise en 1992, a et6 tres utile a cet egard. En identifiant clairement les
contraintes r6sultant. de la structue existanre des dUpenses, le Gouvemeaent a mis en place
une politique de reorientation des dotations budgdtaires. L'analyse des resultats de cette
polirique est rendue difficile par le fait que le proccssus budgetaire dans son ensemble et le
systerne de suivi de l'execution du budget comporte cncore des insuffisances. Les donnees
disponibles sur F&volution de la masse salariale corlfirment que les Cfforts faits par le
Couveneiment pour mnaitriser la masse salariale ont abouti A des rcsultats appreciables
notamrnmenrt apres la devaluation, lorsque def :nesurcs strictes de contrdle de la hausse des
salaires ont permnis de limiter la croissance de [a masse saiariale a un peu moins de 10 % en
termes nomrniaux (voir tableau 2).
23.    La pro-rammation et le suivi des d6penses connaissent encore des insuffisances. Les
efforts darnelioration de la gestion des d#eznses publiques ont ete au dpart appuves par la
Revue des depenses publiques, qui a formul un certain nombre de recornmandations precises
pour aneliorer la gestion budgetaire, A la fois pour lc budget courant et pour le budget
d'investissement.  II n'a cependant pas ete possible de mettre en ocutvre toutes ces
recomrn^nadations, bien que des series de mesures arr6r6es, dans le cadre des progr3mXes
annuels approuves par le FEMI et visant une plus grande matiise de la gestion budgetaire, aient
ete prises et concrdtisecs. C'est ainsi que demus 1994, des donnees chiffrdes, detaill~es et
relativement fiables swr les onerations financi&res des admiristrations centrales, sont produires
mensuellemcnt dans des delais ne depassant pas [a quinzaine de jours. Elles ont permis
d'ain6liorer sensiblerncnt la maitise de l'ex4cutuon du budget et. A rxavcrs lui, le r)rogramme
6conomique du gouvemenrent. D'autres actions visant la reduction des circuts de la depense,
laamcliorarion de La ,estion de la cresorerie, oau encore Le controle de l'l.volution de la derre sur
la depense intericure, ant aussi e engagres ct devralti aboutir A parrir de 1996. L 'IDA a, pour
sa part, appuye les reformes dans ce domaine a cravers le Projet de d6veloppemrn.  des
institutions publiques (Cr. 2378-BLR), lance en 1992. C'est dans le cadre de c- projet qu'a Pu
etre realise en juin 1995, malgre le retard sur le calendri.r Laitial. le recensernnt des agents de
la fonction publique.
24. Comze prdvu. le Gouvemernment a intoduit une nouvellc nomenclature avec le budget
de 1992, elaboree avec I'aide du F.M14.L. rnais dont l'application s'esc rdvdlee difficile. Son
adoption a fortement perturbe le processus budg6taire et les efforts de suivi des realisauons,
sans dpporter d'ameliorauon notable. C'est pourquoi, et toujours avec l'appui du FMI, une
nouvelle revision de la nomenciartee budgectaire a ete realisdc en 1994-1995 pour &re
appliqu6e pour le budget 1996. Pour l'avenir, I-effort de-rait s'onenrcr plus sur la mafTrise de
la prograrnmation budgetaire que sur le suivi de i'cx:cution du budget.

25.   Programmation  des investtssements publics.   Les reforrnes dans le secteur du
Programme d'investissement public (PIP) sont parvenues a amneliorcr le portefeuille de projets
d'investissements en eliminant des projets non economiques. TouEefois, le PIP n'est pas
encorc devenu un outil de prograrnmation, et reste un simple repertoire des projets
gouvernemcntaux.   Lc budget d'invcstissement devrait refleter la premiere annee du
Programme Triennal d'lnvestissement Public a horizon glissant, ce qui n'est pas encore le cas.
La difficulte reside probablement dans le fait quc les dons et prets projets repr6sentent 90% du
programme d'investissemcnt et que les baulleurs de fonds sont nombreux et pratiquent des
proc6durcs de decaissements et dc suivi aussi vari6es que diverses. L'effort i venir devrait
porter sur l'arnelioration de la coordination. la centralisation du suivi des r6alisations tant
physiques que financieres. 1l6valuation er l'inscription, dans les budgets de fonctionermnent,
des charces recurrentes.
26.    Conccniralion sur les secreurs prioriraires.  Avant le d6marrage du programme
d'ajusicment, la politique budgetairc ne refletait aucune priorite sectorielle clairement d6finie.
L'enseignement primaire, les soins de sanat e6imentaires et l'ntretien des infrastructures de
base en avaient donc pati. Vu la strategie de developpement du Burkina Faso deflnic par le
CAS, une attention particuliere devait etre portde aux secteurs de la sante et de l'education,
aiiisi qu'a l'enrreticn de l'infrastructure routierc. C'est ainsi qu'il etait rincessaire d'etablir un
lien exp1lcite entre les secteurs prioritaires et les previsioins budgetaires contenues dans le
Document-cadre. Pour cc faire. il apparaissait necessaire de garantir une augmentation des
dotations budgkraires aux secteurs de la santc et de l'education.  Lorsque les dotations
bud, taires secToriellcs ont ete assur6es, des mesures precises ont ete mises en oeuvre pour
assurer une meeilleure prestation des services au moyen d'operations sectorielles, plus
particulicroment 1ED IV, qui a renfomi les r6formes demarrTes dans lc cadre du CAS 1.
27.    Le CAS I prevoyait de fagon ditaillee l'affectation de rcssources suffisantes aux
secteurs prioritaires. Les budgets programmes depuis 1991 vont dans co sens. Cela apparait
netremcnt si l'on rapporte les ddpenses de fonctionnement (salaires, achats de biens et services
pour lc fonctionnement et les transferts courants) dos ministeres concernes au total des
depenses dc fonctionnement hors traasferts pour restructurations des banques et entreprises et
pour la filiere cotoni. Cela apparait encore plus nettement si 1'on fait ces memes calculs pour
les depenscs effectives (depenses engagees et liquiddes). Cela a etd facilit6 par le fait quo
beaucoup de bailleurs de fonds, s'inscrivant dans le cadre des programmes approuves par la
Banque Mondiale et le FMI, ant r6serve des parts importantes de Icurs appuis financiers aux
depenses pour los sectcurs pnontaL es.

28.   Par ailleurs, le CAS I contenait des clauses visant a accroitre les depcnscs pour
l'entretien routier, qui devaient etre supervisees dans le cadre du Credit d'ajustemcnt du
secteur des cransports. Au d&parT, le programme visait a porter le budget aanuel de 1'entretien
router a 8 rmilliards de francs CFA. Apres la d6valuation, le budget de 1994 pr6voyait une
doca-ion de 4.4 milliards de francs CFA pour 1994 et celuii de 1995 de 4,9 rnilliards de FCFA.
T e l;en entre le CAS I et le PASECT s'est revele tres efficacc.
29.   Plan c'acrzon prioritaire.  La devaluation de ianvier 1994 a ouvert de nouvelles
perspectives de reaffectation des depcases budg6taires.  Ls Gouvernement a traduit sa
determu-uuon par .ui engagement a cworsacrer davantage de ressources a 1'6ducarion ct a la
sante comme refl&t6 dans ie Plan d'action prion'tairc pour l'eniseignement primaire et la santd
du Credit d'appui a la relance cconomique.
30.    Educalin. Le programme dacuon du Gouvernernent dans le secteur de S'education
avait polur objectif de faire passer le taux de scolauisation prinaire de 28 % en 1988 a un
in.inimnum de 40 % en 1996, cc qcu exigeait lembauche de 950 nouveaux instituteurs chaque
annre. I.e Gouvemement a atteint cet objectif et a pu faire passer au cours de l'anade scolare
1993-1994. le taux de scolarisa-ion a 33 % ( estimations). ls,eme si ces resultats restent en
de,a de l'objectif fixe au debut du programme, le nombre d'edeves inscrits au primaire est
passe de i30.000 en 1991-1992 a au moins 600.000 en 1993-1994.
31.   De plus, les mesu.res prdvues dans le Plan d'action prioritaire ont ete incorpor6es au
CAS I comme condi,ions de decaissement de la troisieme tranche. Ce programme a ctc tras
concluant et a permis 'rmbauche de 2.320 nouveaux enseignants ainsi quc la conclusion d'un
accord avec Faso Baara pour la construction et lequipement de cent ecolcs. La rentre
scolaire 1994-1995 se'sr donc deroulee sans accroc, la vaste majorite des instituteurs ayant e6t
a leur poste lars de Ia rcanree scolaire, ceci pour la premiere fois depuis de nombreuses
annees.
32.     .     Dans 'e secteur de la sante, les pnorites consisticat a aneliorer la couverture,
la qualit6 et l'utilisation des services de soins primaires. A cet egard, le Gouvemnement a
appliquet une politique dc decentralisation des services de sante publique, en accordant
noraxnent en 1993 une autonomie financierc aux formations sanitaires et en mettant en place
uta regime de recouvremenr partiel des couts pour les services octroyes et les medicaments
fournis, donnant ainsi utn sens veritablc a cetre autonomie. En outre, dans le but d'assurer une
large disponibilitd et un couLt abordabic des medicaments, le Gouverniement a mus en oeuvre
Lule polirique de commercialisation des m^dicaments essentiels et g6n6riques.  Afin
docncourager l'urilisation de ces medicaments generiques par Ic biais du secteur priv6, lc
GouvernemenE a autorise les pharmaciens a exploiter des points cLe vente de detail et a
presc.rc les equivalents generiques. 11 a en outre remplace le systtme de contr6le des prix a
marge bendficiaire fixe pour tous les'me,idicaments par une Liste nationale des prix portant sur
environ 70% des medicaments essentiels ct generiques les plus frdquerninent utilises. Au lieu
de stocker des medicaments de marque A prix d1eve, les pharmaciens ont donc optc pour des
medicamernts g6n6nques rnoins couiteux. Dans ce domaine, le Burkina est devenu un modele
dans la region.
33.   ILe systeme pour la distribution et le recouvrement des coats des mddicaments
essentiels eE gdneriques, mis en place par le gouvemernent dans le cadre de l'Initiative de
Bainako et avec l'aide technique de 1'UNICEF, a conceme enviroa 500 fornations sanitaires

iii)    Mesures incitatijes tn favour du secteur priyv
34'.    Retbrme des enireprises publiques. Au debut du programme d'ajustemeot, le secteur
parapublic comprenait 96 cntreprises, dont 35 de creation recente. La premiere phase du
proaamme de privatisarion prevu d.ans le cadre du CAS I visait a r6duire la participation du
Gouvemement dans 12 entreprises a un maximum  dc 25%. Le programme global de
privatisaton du Gouvernement availt pour objectif de rarnener V'actionnariat du Gouvernement
i un maximum de 25 '/% dans toutes les entreprises commerciales or Lndustrielles oeuvrant
dans les secteurs non sratagiques.
35.    Auparavant, lc Gouvernement avait adopte toutes les modificaTions necessaires au
droit des entreprises pour rendre les enireprises d'Etat plus efficaces et soumettre leur
fonctionnement aux principes commerciaux. La Loi sur la Privarisation a ete proposee par le
Conseil des Ministres enjuillet 1991 et, peu apres, adoptee par le Parlement de meme qu'une
premierc liste de socitets a privatiser. Apres quelques retards, la Commission de Privatisation
fut misc en place pour superviser, la-cession de ces entrepriscs. Le progranime avait pris un
bon depart puisque des offres iniriales avaicnt et6 faites pour la plupart des entreprises dont la
privatisation avair et autorisee par le Parlernent. Toutefois, vers la fin de 1 993. de nouvelles
difficultes d'ordres divers comme celles liees aux progres realises dans la democraiisation des
institutions et l'obligation de transparence, apparurent et ont ralenti le travail de la
commission. De plus les offres de repriscs etaient souvent trop en dega de cc qui etait
souhaite. Ces problcrncs ont necessite une redefinition de la composition, des statuts et des
-egles de fonctionnement de Ia commission de privatisation. ce qui a 6tr fait en a   994.
36.    En mauire de privatisation, trois probl6mes fondamentaux etaient en effet apparus.
Prcmierencnt. la Commission de Privatisation erait composee de fonctionnaires, represcntant
plusieurs minist6res, qui ne corn.acraienr qu'une parie de leur temps i la privatisation.

Certains d'entre eux ne semblaiaet pas ctre familier avec Ie Programme de Privatisation.
Deuxienement, le fait que le programnme soit peu connu, a l'interieur du pays comme a
1'Cxtcrieur, a limite le nombre d'offres recues. Troisiemement, le programme n'a pas bdanfici6
de la participation du secteur bancaire local, cc qui, en soi, n'est pas forcement surprenant; le
scctcur traversan  lui meme unc phasc de restructuration profonde mais qui souleve une
qucstion de choix du momnent. R6trospectivement, il cut ete pr6farable que le secteur bancaire
ait ete associe plus etroitement au processus de Privatisation. Par aillcurs, dans certains cas,,
le Gouvernement, pour des raisons lides aux reglements des problemes sociaux, a ete contraint
de conserver sa part de 25% contre la prifrcnce expri ee par l'acheteur potentiel.
37.    A fin 1994, le nornbre d'entreprises privatisees ou liquidees etait de 12, et 19 autres
entreprises etaient en cours de privatisation. Les subventions de l'Etat aux entreprises
publiques ont et fortement rdduites. Toutefois, lnimpact de la privatisation sur la relance de
l investissement et des activites productives est reste faible. L'accent a e  trop mis sur la
reduction du role du secteur public er pas assez sur I'accroissernnt de lefficacite et des
activites productives des entreprises. Trop pcu de temps a ete consacre au developpement
d'unie approche cohercntc de la privatisation, basec sur une comprehension par toutes les
parities des objectifs recherchds et des options possibles.
38.   Riorganisazion du secteur bancaire.   Parallelement a l'ajustement dans d'autres
secteurs. lc Gouvemenient a decidd, en juin 1990, d'amorcer un processus de reforme du
secteur bancaire, dans Ie but de le r6habiliter ct de d&velopper V'intermndiation financiere. Le
Gouvernement a aussi decide de limiter sa participation dans les cinq principales banques
comrnmerciaies  a un maximum de 25 %. Avant de proceder i ce ddscngagement, il fallait
toutefois encreprcndrc la reorganisation complete des banques pour soit garantir leur viabillt6,
soit, le cas echeant, amorcer les procedures de liquidation.  A  la meme epoque, le
Gouvernement a procedc a l'achat des cr6ances compromises figurant alors dans le bilan des
banques d'Etat et par La suite a confie leur recouvremenE au BRCB. Le recouvrement a
c^pendant ete entrav6 par la lentcur des banques a fournir les documents et justificatifs des
ereances, Ia non solvabilite d un grand nombre de creanciers ct ia lenteur des procddures
judiciaires.
39.   Des cinq banques, quatre ont ete preparees a la privatisation, la cinquieme, la BND-B,
devant atre liquidee. Toutcfois, a la fin de 1994, seulc la privatisation de la BICIA-B avait 6te
aclevee, en ce sens que le secteur prive detenait 75 % des parts sociales. L. Gouvernement
n'itant pas parvenu a ceder au socteur prive ses participations au capital de la CNCA et de la
BIB, il les a confiees en fideicommis a la Banque Ouest-Africaine de D6vcloppement
(BOAD). La privatisation du groupe BFCI n'a obtenu le feu vert de la Commission Bancaire
qu'en Mars 1995 cn raison de retards mis par te repreneur pour foumnir cou.s les documents
requis. La liquidation de la BND-B qui aurait du intervenir au debut de 1993 n'est intervenue
qu'en Decembre de certe annre et devrait etre achevec au debut de 1996.
40.   Des Ie d6part, la rcorganisanon du secteur bancaire s'est rdv0ede comme etant un des
aspects les plus difficiles du progranme. C'est aussi l'une des actions dont la mise en oeuvre
a souvcnt fait l'objet de controverses avec les representants de la Banqu i Mondiale. Le
3ouvcrnement, tout comnie les autres partenaires, avait sous-estftn6 les difficultes et n'avait
pas accordc l'artention ni les moycns en rapport avec l'importance de l'operation qui a coulte
' Banque intecrnationale du Burkina (BIB); Ia Banque internaionale pour le commerce, I'industrie et
l'agriculrure (BICIA-B); la Banque pour le financemcnE du commerce et dc l'industric (BFCI), qui a fiusionne par
la suite avec deux banques de moindre Lmportancc; la Caisse nationale de cr6dit agricole (CNCA); cc la B1anque
narionale de d6veloppemzent du Burkina (BND-B).

plus de 60 milliards de FCFA. L'effort de la BCEAO n'avait pas et non plus en rapport avec
Ics cxigences de I operation. Dc sorl c6te la Banque, en exigeant, du moins dans les premiers
temps, la celerite dans le processus de privatisation a fait que certaines erreuxs n'ont pu etre
evitees. Cela fut lc cas lorsque, par exemple, les repreneurs des banques avaient exigc la
r6rnunrratZiOn des titres emis par l'Etat en contropartie du rachat des creances compromises.
Certe r6mun6ration n'avait pas ete initialenient prevue, rnais elle a tc exi,ge par les
representants des banques A la veille de lVech6ance imposee par la Banque Mondiale (30 juin
1994) pour finaliser l'operation de titrisation.
40 bis En 1995 on peut considerer que l'objectif de reduire la participation de lEtat dans
chaque banque a un maximum de 25% a etc a peu pres atteint et le BRCB est en voie de
r6aliser son objectif dc recouvremelit de 30%  ides pr-ts recouvrables. L'intermediation
financiere et la inise a disposition de ressources pour l'investissement du secteur priv6 n'ont
cependant pas atteint le niveau souhairt. Les banques continuent d'accumulcr d'importantes
liquidites et nc pr&tenE que des montants limites pour le financemeni de l'investissement prive.
UIne analyseplus ddtaillec de I'6volution du systedme bancaire au Burkina Faso depuis la misc
en oeuvrc du programme d'ajustenment a fait l'objet d'un rapport qui a ete remis au
Gouvemement en avril 1995.
41.   Rdglemeniatzon du commerce exrdrieur.  Le Gouvcrnement a comrnmence en 1990 a
d6ployer des efforts visarit A accroitre la concurrence en matiere de commerce extcrieur. Les
autorisations pr6alables a I'exportation ont etc abolies pour tous les produits a lexception des
cereales, le monopole de l'Etat sur les exportations a ctc supprirne, exception faite du coton et
dc l'or. Dans le meme sens. toutes les taxes a lexportation ont cte cnlevees. Dans le cadre du
CAS I. Ic Gouvernement voulait eliminer 90% environ de toutes les restrictions quantitatives
avant la fin dc l'annde 1992, les demi'eres restrictions devant etre levees avant la fin de 1993.
Sculs cinq  produits (les armes et I6quipcment rnilitaire. les explosifs, les produits
pliarmaccutiques, les plantes toxiques et cartains filets de pache) seraient assujernis h. une
autorisation speciale pour des questions de securitc, de sante et d!environnerment.
42     La simplification des dernjieres restrictions quantitatives a te dans un premier temps
retardee, mais une rcforme exhaustive du tarf douanier a ete mise en oeuvre en janvier 1993,
en m6nie temps que ddinarraienw les reformes r6gionales. Cela a abouti A un nombre r.duit de
raux pour les droits de douane et une rcduction des fourchetres. abaissant ainsi le caulx moyen
de protection effective sur la base duquel de nombreux producteurs mnefficaces conduisaient
leurs activites.   Le desir dc prot6ger ces groupes avair entraine iune proliferation
d'exonerations; problemes aggraves par les difficultes pour le Gouvernement a mertre en
oeuvre dimportantes mesures d'accompagnemcnt comme la Taxe Degressive de P.otection
(TDP) et les ristourncs sur les droits de douane pour Les produits export6s. Ces mesures
initroduites qu'a la fin dtc l'aanne 1993 sur les importations de 22 produiLs. ne se justiflaient
plus apres la devaluation de janvier 1994, et ont ere, depuis, progressivemcnt abolies. Le
taux, fixe au depart a 30 % de la valeur C.A.-F, a ete ramend a 10 % au debuE de 1995 et sera
aboli au premier janvier 1996.
43.    Libiralisazion des prix. Au debut du programme d'ajustement, 44 groupes de produits
iznportos etaient assujettis a des marges bencficiaires, ce chiffre devant atre graduellernent
rainene a 36, A la fin de 1991, et a 5 en 1992. Les restrictions quantitatives devaient 8te
levees simultanement. Les prix des produits locaux devaient etre libdres, a ['exception du riz,
du sucrc et de la farine de froment er mars 1991. La liberalisation de ces prix devrait se
poursuivre dais le cadre du Premier credit d'ajustement du secteur agricole.
44.    Le Gouvernement avait ealement l'intention de simplifier de maniere significative le
ri^gime de prix et dc taxes pour les produits p6troliers. Un calendrier ddtailke a 6te prepar6

pour la revision des mecanismes d'6tablissement des prix petroliers mais des divergences sont
apparus quanL au systeme qui devait &ventuellement atre mis en place. Une prerni6re
proposition elaboree par l'administation burkinabe au debut de 1993 n'avait pas recu 1'aval de
la Banque Mondiale. Au cours dc ia mission de supervision de juillet 1993, un rapport revise
recommandant unc rdformc partielle du systeme de commercialisation et d'etablissement des
prix pour les produirs petroliers a 6t 6tudi6 et discute avec les repr6sentants dc la
SONABI-IY, de la CGP et du Mirist6re du commerce. Le systeme de prix a finalement ete
considcrablement simplifi6 et rcadu plus transparent; il comportait une seule taxe ad valorem
et i'elinimnatiori de la CGP dans Ic processus de perceptioE des taxes sur les produits petroliers
iniporrts. Le nouveau syst6me a 6te promulgue au debut de 1994. A la fin de cette meme
annce, u.n systemc de prix souple pour les produits p6troliers a ete introduit, avec un
m6canisme de revision des prix tous les quatre mois.
4D.   Le Gouvemement a dgalement entrepris d'etudier et de reviser le role des differents
organismes intervenant dans les mdcanismes de srabilisation des prix. Ainsi, en 1994, le role
de Ia Caisse Gzndrale de perequation (CGP) a . tA limite ai l'importation et i la vente do riz en
gros. Dans le cadre du Credit a ['ajustement du sectcur agicole, la Caisse de stabilisarion des
pnx des produits agricoles (CSPPA) devait etre liquidee, ce qui ne est en cours, mais elle
aintcrvicnt plus sur le marchd et a transferd toutes les responsabilites qui lui restaient dans le
seeLeur dc 1'exportation au secteur pnve.
46.   Dans le cadrc du CAS I, le Gouvemement a egaleinent propose d'etudier le role de
l'oTice national des cereales (OFNACER). Celui-ci a dte liquide en juin 1994 a la suite de la
liberalisation des prix et du commerce des cereales. Une nouvelle structure a ete crme. la
Societe Nationale de Gesrion des Stocks de Securite (SONAGESS), dont la seule activite sera
de gerer le stock national de securite.
47.   Reforme du cadre rdgZemenlaire e juridiquc. La refonte du cadre reglementaire et
juridique dans lequel le sccteur prive serait appele a fonctionner a I'avenir constinrait l'une des
pierres angulaires du programme d'ajustement. Les principaux secteurs qui devaient &te
abordes dans le cadre du CAS I etaient  i) la revision du code des investissements; ii) la
constitution d'un comite de revision des lois disposant de pouvoirs statutaires afin de reviser,
mcrtrc i jour. modih9er et consolider Les textes juridiques dans le but de les publicr dans le
Journal Officiel et iii) ure r6vision du code du travail dans le but de reduire les ri-idites du
marchc du travail et de simplifier les procedures d'embauche et de licenciement.
48.   Code def invesrissements. Les lacunes de l'ancien code des investissements, dont la
dernierc revision remonte a 1984, avaient mene a I'etablissement de plusieurs missions avant
meme ia rr.ise en placc du CAS 1. Une mission de preparacion de l'IDA ct une mission
conjointe FIAS/AMGI, ont abouu a un accord avec le Gouvemnement sur les revisions a
apporter au Code des investissements. La revision est tinalement intervenue au cours d'une
mission de supervisioL en novembre-1991. Le nouveau code entrc en vigueur n juin 1992,
contormement aux objectifs de depart, offre d6sormais aux investisseurs des mesures
Lncitaives plus neutres et transparentes.
49.   Code commercial.  Avant le debut du programmc d'ajustement, il naexistait pas de
recucil de droit commercial au Burkina Faso. Dans l1 cadre d'une initiative plus globale de
consolidation des lois er texcs Icgislatifs existants, et commne condition d'entrde en vigueur du
PAA, le Gouvemement avait cree en  1992 la Commission permanente nationale de
codification (DdcreE No 92/149/MU), qui comprend, entre autres, une sous-commission de
droit commercial et dc reforrne judiciaire. En octobre 1993, le Burkina Faso a signs le traite
portant creation de l'Organisation pour l'harmnon.isation du droit des affaires en A.frique
(OHADA), dont l'objet principal ;sE de promouvoir 1'arnonisation du droit corn.mercial en

elaboranlt et en adoptant des lois uniformisees. Dans cc but, la Commission Nationale de
Codification a amorce uli examnen des projets de lois rtgissant les activitds cornmerciales sous
les auspices du Secretariat General de 1'OHADA.  Scion les terrnes du traite, les lois
uniformisees nc peuvent entrer en vigueur qu'une fois examin6es et adoptees par Ic Conseil
des Ministres de I'OHADA et publiees dans le Journal Officiel de ceLte orga.nisation. Si les
lois nont pas eacore ete adopttes par le Burkina Faso, des progros irnportants ont etc realisds
dans l'actualisation des lois commerciales. Ce processus d'harmonisation regionale du droit
corrmercial est VLvement appuy6 par la Banque et des ressourCes ont &t6 utilisees dans le
cadrc du volet juridique du PAA pour appuyer ces changements.
50.   Code du travail, L'ancien code du travail presentait deux elements problematiqucs:
d'abord. le rnonopole sur l'embauche detenu par l'Office national pour l'emploi (ONPE) et,
deuxiemernent, les restrictions sur Les contrats de travail a durce d6terminde. La lev6e de ces
dcux obstacles etant jugee essertielle pour lassouplissement du marche du travail, l'accord de
crddit prevoyait comme condition de liberation de la dcuxieme tranche l'limin.ation du
monopole de l'ONPE et l'limination de toute restriction sur la durxe et Ic nombre de
prorogarions des contrats de travail a durce deterrnin6e. Lc processus de r6forme du code du
travail, cornmence i la fin de 1990, prdvoyait des consultations avec six orga.nisations
syndicales. Pour faciliter les nergociarions, toujours difficiles, le BIT a fourni son assistance.
Un consensus avaiL &e trouve pour uln nouveau Code du Travail qui a ete adopte par ie
parlement en 1992. La Banque avait cependant jugee certaines de ses dispositions comme
contraires a la lletre de l'accord de credit du CAS T. La mission de supervision de juillet 1993
s'est concentrec sur les questions non encore reglkcs dans le code ct a engag6 les discussions
sur certaines ambiguRtds du texte et linrerpretation ;a donner aux textes relatifs aux conLrats de
travail a durdec d6tenminde.  A  Vlpoque, lc Gouvemement craignait la reouverture dc
discussions au Parlement, un compronils a ete trouve. Les d6crets d'applicadion de la Loi ont
6t6 pris, levant en grande partie les ambiguit6s et proposant une interpretation qui ciarifie le
texte de loi dans un esprit conforine au CAS I.
iv)    Vaiorisation de5 ressources humaines ct allegement de la pauvretc dans le cadre du
proramrnme d'Austement.
51.   Un element a part enticre dans le suivi de l'impact du programme d'ajustement etait la
mise en oeuvre de l'enquete prioritaire. Les donn~cs recueillies devaient perrnettre le suivi et
l'valuation des conditions de vie des populations au cours de la pnriode d'ajustement. Certe
cnquete a -et concue avant le programme d'ajusternent et devait commencer cn 1991. Si cette
enquero dtait prevue dans tous les Docunent-cadres depuis le debut du programme
d'ajusteement. elle n'a pu 8tre r6aliske qu'en 1994 et ses resultats n'ont pu atre disponibles qu'en
1995. Comme ce fut le cas dans plusieurs pays de la region. les difficultes a preparer et mrener
ce genre d'enqudtcs avaient ete sous estimees. De plus des complications ont surgi par la suite
torsqu'il a falIu coordonner le financement des diff6rents donateurs (PNIUD, Union
europeenne, Banque africaine de ddvelopperment et IDA avec un don de la Norv6ge). Ce qui
explique en grande partic ces retards.
D.    PRNCIPAUX   FACTEURS   AYANT   EU   UNE   INCIDENCE   SUTR   LE
PROGRAMME
52.    Trarnsitioin nolitique. Lors de la preparation du projet, il etait deji pr6visible que la
situation politique allait changer, et les problemes quc cela risquait dc poser avaient bien dt6
anticipds au moment de la conception de l'op6radion. L'impact precis n'etait pas connu, mais
avant l'entree en vigueur, tout semblair indiquer que les rctards seraient minimnes. Cependant,

durant la prermnrc rmission de supervision, effectuce a l'epoque des elections presidentielles, il
ctait que ce ne serait pas le cas. II 6tait manifeste que les syndicats, notamxnent, dtaient
opposes aux restructurations d'entreprises, aux compressions d'effectifs, a la suppression dc
certaines indemnnites accordtes aux fonctionnaires et a la mise en place d'un systeme de
promotions sans augmentations de salaire, ainsi qu'a la reduction du nombre de bourses
d'etudes; toutes mesures ayant pour objet de reduire les transferts budgdtaires courants. C'cst
pourquoi, apres les premi6res rdformes engag6es en 1991, le programme d'ajustement avait
marquc la pas pratiquement jusque vers la fin de 1993.
53.    Cadre externe. Membre de la zone du FTanc CFA, lc Burkina etait extmement
sensible a 1'cvolution de la conjoncture economique dans les pays voisins d'Afrique
francophone. dont le plus important est la C Ote d'Ivoire. Toute la zone du Franc CFA a connu
un lent mais neanmoins prononce d6clin dc ses performances economiques. La croissance
negative du PrB de la Core d'Ivoire. depuis 1985 , a eu un effet negatif sur les transferts des 3
millions de Burkinabes Vivant dans cc pays.
.54.   La devalualon. La devaluation dejanvier 1994 a eu une incidence favorable en ce qui
concerne le programme d'ajustement et les perturbations previsibles dans la misc en oeuvre de
certaines mesures (liberalisation dcs prix) n'ont et que de courte dur6e. Les avantages d'un
rcajustement de parite 6taient apparus bien avant la d6valuation. Depuis la decision de janvier
1994, Ics efforts de reforrne se sont intensifies de maniere notable, appuyes par le CARE.
E.     PERENNITE DU PROGRAMME
54 bis Le processus d'ajustement a, pour de nombreuses realisations, un caractere irreversible.
C'est le cas notamrnen: des restructurations et privatisatioiis qui, a moins d'6v6nements
extraordinaires peu pro bables, ne pourraicnt etre remises e cause. D'autres progres par contre
restent fragiles et necessitent des actions de consolidation. C'est le cas par exemple des
reformes realisties pour l'ameiioration des recettes budg6taires. I'execution et le suivi des
depenses, la gestion de la dette et l'61imination des arricres-..
54 rcr  La consolidation du processus d'ajustemenrt sera assuree en priorite par les
comportcments nouveaux des fonctionnaires, a tous les niveaux de responsabilite, dans la
mise en oeuvre des politiques du Gouvemement. Le programme d'ajustement vise la rigueur
dans la gestion et la recherche permanente de V'am61ioration du fonctionnement des
nstltluroas, actions qui doivent rester fondamentalement immuables. Des mesures nouvelles
sont aussi necessaire pour consolider les progres, notemment dans I'appui au developpement
du secteur prive, le dteveloppernrt de lintermediation financire, la programmanion budgetaire
et la gestion des projers publiques.
F.     PERFORMANCE DE LA BANQUE
55    Les interventions de la Banque ont 6t6 gendraIemcnt d'un grand apport pour la partie
burkinabe, cn particulier pour cc qui concerne les secteurs de la sante et de 1'dducation.
Quelques points d'application du programme ont fait l'objet de controverses et
d'irterpr6tations divergentes. Bien que non fondamentales. ces divergences ont neanmoins
fortement perturbe le dcroulement normal du programme en raison des retards qu'ils ont
occasioner dans les decaissements des appuis financiers, de la Banque en premier lieu et d'un
certains nombre d'autres bailleurs de fonds qui conditionnaicat leur appui Ic decaissements
des credits de la Banque.

55     Pcndant la preparation et casuite l'ex6cution de diverses composances du programnue,
trop peu de temps avait ete consacrc aux discussions sur i) les grands objectifs des reformnes,
ii) les diffcrentes option.s possibles, ct iii) les modalites specifiques. en particulier dans le
domaine de la rdforme des entreprises publiques et du secteur bancaire. Les decaissemenrts des
tranches de credits de la Banque ont etc retardes du fait de divergences d'opinions sur la
responsabilite du Gouvemement dans la mise en place des reformes. Le Gouvemmrnent
pcrcevait le credit corrnc I'enonciation des objectifs economiques quil s'itait engage a
poursuivre, alors que la Banque Mondiale suivait une logique plus legaliste de 1'ex6curion du
progrmnme, sans tcnir compte des eventuelics implications negatives sur son deroulement.
G.     FUTURES OPERATION'S
55.    Les prochaines opcrations seront determinantes pour la perennitd du programme
d'ajustement. Si les performances rnacro-cconomiques de base sont suivies dans le cadre du
pro-ramme mis en oeuvre au titre de la FASR du Fonds, les resultats dans les differents
sectcurs dependront de la maniere dont seront menes a bien tant les projets en cours que lds
futurs projets. I1 es; clair que le Burkina n'est pas encore au bout de son programme de
reformes. Tel est notaminnnt le cas pour l'agriculture, secteur dans lequel, en liaison avec Ic
promier credit d'ajustemenL sectoricl, se poursuivent des rtformes qui seront approfondies au
cours d'une seconde operation ax6e sur 'clirnination des restrictions encore existantes dans les
domaines du riz, du sucre et du cocon, dc maniere a stimuler une forte reponse du c6re de
l'offre.
56.     Plus important le secteur privd doit encore devenir lc moteur de la croissance
economique. Un projet pour le secteur niinier. acruelleinent progranmrn pour l'exercice en
cours, constituera une cremiere etape a cet egard. Ll faudrait encore arneliorer l'ensemble de
mesures incitatives destinces a developper l'investissement dans le secteur minier afin de
permeMe un net decoilement de la production miniere du Burkina. En fin le developpement
du secteur privc er la poursuite de l'amelioration de la gestion des finances publiques de
mnaniere a pouvoir soutenir cornme il convient les activites du sectcur prive sont aussi au
centrc des preoccupations.  Les rdformes concernant ccs domaines seront au coeur de la
prochainc operation d'ajusternent.
H.     PR1NCIP aUL X ENSEIGNIENMENTS TIRES
57.    Concepiuon. Certe operation n'a pas etd facile a mettre au point car il s'agissait de la
premiere operatiun d'ajusremen.t pour le Burkina; dc plus, le pays etaitjusre sous le coup d'un
changement de regime, qui a occupc le devant de la scene politique pendant plusicLLrs aanecs.
Toutefois, vu la necessite de s'artaq4er a des reformncs dans plusieurs domaines a la fois. il
etait inevitabIe que la premiere operation d'ajustemcnt ait une portie g6ndrale. Elle a ete
suivie par plusieurs operations d'ajustement sectoriel et par d'autres credits. Cette demarche a
cte efficace dans plusicurs secteurs, en particulier l'ducation et les transports.  Mais sur
d'autres plans, pnvatisation et r6formes budgetaires par exemple, les progres ont ete
cxtremement lents, en depit de projets de suivi. Une prochaine operation daijustement devrait
etre rrcs bien ciblee er mettrc l'accent sur les domnaines dans lesquels des r6formes cruciales
restent a accomplir.
58.    Menialiie des agents de la foncnon publique. Les riformes qui ont pu etre nises en
oeuvre par simple decrer oat g6n6ralement ete des rdussites. Les prix ont ete liber6s, les
barrinres commerciales supprimre6 eE les monopoles publics elirnines. Mais les r6formes daw

lesquclles les fonctionnaires, a qui il appartenait de mecttr en oeuvre les changements au
niveau de la place de I'Etat, devaientjouer un rdle deterroinant, ont progresse nettement plus
lents. La mentalite des agents de la fonction pubLique n'a pas evolue au mame rythme que la
politique du Gouvemement, ce qui a rendu pratiquement impossible I'application de certaines
mesures, en matice notamment de privatisation et de reforme du secteur bancaire. Dans les
futures op&rations, les conditions de mise en oeuvre devront etre definies de fa;on tres concise
avant le lancement des reformes. Le seul moyen pour quo les agences d'cxicution et les
fonctionnaires fassent avancer les reformes envisagFes au lieu de les ralentir est qu'ils en
comprein=cnt pleinement la finalite. C'cst plourquoi. les efforts en madi6re d'explication des
programmes devrout etre poursuivis er rcnforces.
59.   Ordre de succession des reformes. L'ordre de succession des differentes mesures est
dcterminant pour la reussitc d'un programxmne de riformes. C'est un point auquel il a, maints
egards, ete insuffisamment accorde attention dans le cadre du prograrmne consid6rd:
* Le fait d'avoir mene de front privanisation ct reorganisation des entreprises
publiques et du secteur bancaire a ete contre-productif. Un programme de
privatisation bien conqu n'aurait di intervenir qu'apr6s que la restructuration du
secteur bancaire, devenu ainsi h meme d'appuyer l'exdcution du programme de
privatisation.
* La reorientation des depenses publiques alors meme que des changements etaient
introduirs dans les procedures budgetaires a considerablement complique la
supervision du programme. Les changements dans la nomenclature budgetaire
n'ont jamais i6t effectues de faron satisfaisanEe, alors mime qu'il etait absolument
essentiel de surveiller les allocations de ressources et les depenses pour un certain
nombre d'autres objectifs. II aurait fallu soit mettre la nouvelle nomenclature on
place rapidement, avec tous les contr6les nccessaires afin dcriter toute confusion
dans son application, soit garder l'anciennc jusqu'a cc que les depenses publiques
soient comnil6tcmcnt restructur6es.
