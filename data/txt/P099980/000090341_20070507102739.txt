RecentDevelopmentsinthe AfghanEconomy

 1.     Afghanistanhas achieved respectable economic growth duringthe past four years,
with the real value of non-opium Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increasing by 29
percent in 2002/03, 16 percent in 2003/04, 8 percent in 2004/05, a drought year, and 14
percent in 2005/06. The Governmento f Afghanistan (GOA) has also maintained a stable
macroeconomic framework as evidenced by the successful completion o f all quarterly
reviews under the IMF Staff-Monitored Program (SMP, from March 2004 to March
2006) and the first review of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
program. Monetary policy has been restrained, supported by the adherence to strong
fiscal discipline and a "no overdraft" rule that prohibits Central Bank from financing a
deficit. Inflation i s decelerating and year-on-year inflation declined to 5.2 percent in
September 2006 (compared to 16percent in2004/05).

2.      Duringthis period, public spendingmanagedthrough the budget process has been
the government's main tool to implement its development strategy and coordinate donor
assistance. In 2004, the government introduced the concept o f a core budget (all funds
flowing through government accounts subject to its Public Financial Management [PFM]
regime) and an external budget (external assistance directly executed by donors;
essentially ex-PFM) that accounts for almost two thirds of all spending. The core budget
consists o f an operating budget ("ordinary budget" covering current expenditure and
some small capital expenditure) and a development budget (reconstruction projects and
some recurrent costs). The total core budget expenditure increased between 2004/05 and
2005/06 by 30 percent to US$l.1 billion. Within the core budget, operating expenditures
amounted in 2005/06 to US$651 million, 63 percent of which consisted o f wages and
salaries.  Core development expenditures reached US$424 million, increasing by 58
percent from 2004/05, reaching almost six percent of GDP, a commendable level by
international standards. This development strategy has created a high demand for
maintaining credible, transparent and effective PFM performance, principally through the
Ministryo fFinance (MOF).

3.      While the external budget is financed exclusively from donor grants, the core
budget i s financed from four sources: (i)   domestic revenues, which reached US$415
million in 2005/06 (5.7 percent o f GDP); (ii)donor grants, including the Afghanistan
Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) and proceeds o f the International Development
Association (IDA) budget support (US$724 million or 9.9 percent of GDP); (iii)  external
loans, including the proceeds o f the Programmatic Support for Institutional Building I
(PSIB I)(US$107 million or 1.5 percent o f GDP); and (iv) changes in currency deposits
at Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB), Afghanistan's central bank. To date, the GOA has been
able to maintain donor confidence and participation by operating within an agreed
Medium Term Financing Framework (MTFF) that has accompanied its medium term
development and poverty reduction agenda.

4.            Continuing to use the budget process as the main instrument for promoting
developmentandpoverty reduction, the GOA and donors have agreed on a revised MTFF
(Table 1.1), based on the recently concluded Interim-Afghanistan National Development
Strategy (I-ANDs)and "Compact" to end 2009-10. Meeting Compact objectives requires
substantial increase in spending from US$1.1 billion in 2005/06 to US$1.6 billion in
2006/07 and US$2.6 billion by 2009/10. In addition to making needed investments in
development projects, key increases in operating expenditures are likely to be driven by:
(i) implementationofanewpayandgradingpolicy; (ii) recruitmentofaround
     the                                                                                      the
 10,000 teachers per year; (iii) increase in non-wage expenditures to cover levels for
                                              an
operating and maintaining new investments and to accommodate costs transferred from
the external budget previously financed by donors outside the budget process; and (iv)
significant increases inthe security sector.

5.           GOA is expected to make a major improvement in generating domestic revenue
over the Compact period, and has secured technical assistance to strengthen tax and
customs performance. Nonetheless, there are significant risks and uncertainties about the
outcome of this effort. As a result, donors' assistance will remain crucial as a source o f
stable and predictable financing for Afghanistan's budget inthe coming years. Building
on pledges made at the London Conference, external assistance to the budget is expected
to increase from US$l.O billion in2006/07 to US$l.6 billion in 2009/10. The ARTF and
the Law and Order Trust Fundfor Afghanistan are expected to remain key vehicles for
this assistance. Inaddition, Afghanistan has adopted a prudentexternal debt strategy and
i s expected to borrow only at concessional terms. It i s also expected to become eligible
under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative, combined with the Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative and bilateral commitment to debt cancellation, should lead to



                                                                 7

significant debt relief in the coming years. All o f these initiatives and options remain
feasible, however, ifthe international community maintains confident that PFM functions
are performed following acceptable international norms for transparency and
accountability.     It also would require that a larger percentage of the annual budget
provisions (currently at about 37%) be used inthe year for which they are allocated as an
indication o f growing efficiency inthe use o f public monies.

AchievementsinPFM

6.       Since 2002 the GOA has made progress in establishing a functioning public
financial management system under the direction o f the MOF.                  The World Bank
assessment o f Afghanistan's public financial management and procurement performance'
conducted under the auspices o f the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
(PEFA) program (November 27, 2005), concluded that while there are weaknesses that
threaten longer term sustainability o f the M O F performance and "exacerbate the
disconnect between public expectations and the actual delivery o f services, the strong
achievements interms o f fiscal discipline, cash control, and aggregate transparency have
contributedto macroeconomic stability, as well as to sustained external assistance."

7.       The MOF is producing annual budgetsthat meet basic requirements of the GOA-
IMF-Donor approved MTFF, even though the timeliness o f preparingthese budgets and
the system for monitoring budget execution and assuring their development effectiveness
continues to require improvement. The system i s also performing adequately against each
o f the six basic sets o f criteria used to evaluate performance in the PEFA2 partnership
program. MOF's overall performance has also been recently reconfirmed in the Mid
Term Review o f the Public Administration Capacity Building (PACB) project that has
provided financial support for the MOF treasury, procurement, and audit functions.

8.       Importantly, the basic legal framework underlying the PFM and procurement
systems has also been established including new procurement and financial management
basic laws, establishment o f basic systems and protocols for procurement and financial
operations, and reporting and performance auditing. Recruitment and training o f Afghan
staff inprocurement has begun. Additional analysis has been completed that provides the
basis for upgrading the Afghanistan Financial Management Information System(AFMIS)
and training o f staff inbasic accounting and auditing has occurred.

9.       However, these achievements have been obtained with a high degree o f direct
donor assistance through the ARTF Administrator's Office and the Afghanistan National
Development Agency and with the use o f costly operations contracts with international
firms, including the hiring o f qualified Afghans as national contractors. In addition, the

                                                 8

integrity o f the system has depended on having PFM operations centralized in the MOF
with little direct management role assigned to line ministries, provincial offices, or state
owned enterprises. Moreover this control i s being managed on a "transactions" basis,
and with significant levels o f ex ante clearances. Currently, as many as 70 long term
international and 200 national contactors assure that MOF performs its basic budgeting,
treasury, audit and procurement functions adequately. Not surprisingly, the areas o f
performance under the PEFA assessment with the highest ratings were those in which
contractors played the most dominant role.

10.     Donors have been willing to support such heavy direct management and
supervision as part o f addressing the emergency situation facing the country. However,
this is not a sustainable situation and reforms should now be pursued to raise the level of
responsibility and accountability for PFM within the "mainstream" MOF. The ANDs
and Compact negotiated betweenthe GOA and the donor community has identified both
improving the performance o f financial management services and capacity building to
permit these services to be mainstreamed into the MOF and line ministries as part of their
core operations. With this improved performance, the donor community would be able to
meet several o f its own wishes to improve the effectiveness o f aid for Afghanistan:
improving the timeliness and predictability in providing necessary resources, increased
use o f the core budget to receive and manage assistance (decreasing the reliance on the
"external budget") and improve transparency on usingthe external budget when used.

ContinuingChallenges,IssuesandConstraints

11.     To achieve its developmental goals, GOA and the donor community have agreed
on a MTFF to 2010 that i s ambitious and sensitive to risks. Overall spending through the
core budget i s projected to rise by 63% compared to the plan for 2007 (Table 1.1). O f
this, "ordinary spending" for personnel, operating costs and small investments would
grow by 33%. This will increase the number o f small, repetitive transactions, involving
numerous agencies (the top 10 line ministries3excluding defense and interior, account for
only about 46% o f this spending) and place increased demands on regular cash
management, accounting, auditing, and the performance o f these functions by line
ministries. The MTFF also calls for an increase of about 100% in the development
budget. Success in realizing this level o f investment spending depends heavily on the
GOA'S capability to execute tendering and contract management and to do so following
improved procurement management practices. Currently, only about 52% o f planned
expenditures are being realized. This spending i s concentrated in relatively few line
ministries; five line ministries4are expected to account for in excess o f 60% o f the total
and the top 10 account for virtually the entire development budget. Lastly, while GOA
expects to increase the level o f financing through customs and nationally generated taxes,
realistically the MTFF continues to require a 50% increase in external financing. The
willingness o f external sources to be forthcoming in a regular and predictable manner

will depend on maintaining transparency and good governance in public financial
management.

12.     Inorder to strengthen the capability and sustainability o f the PFM system, MOF
and the Control and Audit Office (CAO) have recognized that it will have to address
several organizational and capacity constraints.


         0    Incomplete re-organization o f MOF. While all main departments within
              M O F have undergone restructuring under the Priority Reform and
              Restructuring (PRR) program, the MOF would still require restructuring
              o f its remaining functions to assure that all o f its departments work as an
              integrated whole. It i s also important that staffing plans in terms o f
              numbers, job descriptions, grade levels, and qualifications be finalized.
              This i s critical for making further staffing decisions, including revising
              grading and pay to adopt the GOA pay and grading policy, internalizing
              new rules governing the civil service; establishing the balance betweenthe
              use o f international and national contractors and civil servants to perform
              PFM functions.


         0    Concentration o f Responsibility. A high degree o f accountability in
              financial management decisions has been achieved by concentrating them
              inthe hands o f the ARTF, Afghanistan Reconstruction and Development
              Services (ARDS) and in MOF departments, in a closely monitored
              "transaction-based" system. However, this has also the effect o f lowering
              accountability for procurement and financial management decisions on the
              part of line ministries and agencies and actually increases the governance
              risk o f operations. There are limits to the expansion o f the internal
              capacity o f the M O F to further expand the transaction-based system and
              remain responsive, accountable and efficient. Line ministries and agencies
              should be involved in PFM to increase predictability and timeliness o f
              their operations, albeit, in parallel with their capacity to meet
              accountability standards.


         0    Inadequate Human Resources Numbers, Capacity and Management.
              Engaging international firms and local consultants to perform basic
              treasury, budget, audit and procurement functions has been a default
              strategy, considering the inadequate technical capacity o f the civil service
              and inadequate incentives to the few who are qualified to remain in
              government service. Government external auditing in Afghanistan, for
              example, i s still dependent on external international advisors to perform
              financial statements audits and to conduct any other audits to acceptable
              standards. There i s no accounting profession inthe country and training in
              certification related programs i sjust becoming available and i s given only
              in English which as such is not accessible for most CAO staff. Several
              remedies, including off-site training, adequate grading and pay, effective
              recruiting and management o f careers o f civil servants for the longer term



                                            10

   (including pension management), and establishing schemes o f service for
   key professional classes are interlinked factors and require specialized
   management capacity that the MOF and most other ministries lack.

   Anti-corruption and Maintaining Accountability and Transparency while
   Reforming. The control environment on which Afghanistan's PFM formal
   controls rest i s undermined by corruption in its various forms and
   manifestations. This i s increasingly seen as one o f the most important
   threats to Afghanistan's entire state-building and to delivering public
   services.   The GOA recognizes the critical importance o f addressing
   corruption and the MOF i s seeking advice on how to fight it. While a
   strategy is being developed and implemented, however, the current PFM
   operational functionality cannot be reduced while the effects o f PFM
   reforms are realized. Therefore, the M O F reform program would be
   compelled to maintain the high levels o f transparency and accountability,
   which are constraints on corruption, already attained with the current
   technical assistance. Moreover, the demands for transparency and
   accountability for the use o f public resources is growing in Afghanistan,
   first as anti-corruption sentiment i s growing and second as the legislature
   i s developing its role. Meeting these requirements would constrain the
   pace at which M O F could reduce its dependence on international
   supported staff and contracted services and de-concentrate o f PFM
   operations. The transformation process would require careful study and
   management including close monitoring and evaluation, and adjustment o f
  the reform program.


0 Maintaining Good Coordination and Momentum in Reform. Most experts
   see "reform" as an evolutionary process which requires time and the
   involvement o f all departments whose functions are interlinked.It i s also a
  process that affects individuals who should be engaged. With several
   sources o f assistance coming to the MOF, there i s a risk o f disconnects
  between the programs, agendas, timing and standards that may be adopted
  that would impair the smooth functioning the MOF as the GOA'Sapex
  public finance management organization. Moreover, staff may be subject
  to declining motivation and performance ("reform fatigue") as the process
  extends over time. Therefore a participatory and "change management"
  approach to improving performance would be preferred over a centralized
  "administered" change process. Both o f these initiatives require a vehicle
  for coordinating and planning change that will be sustained for a
  considerable period o f time.

B. Government'sPublicFinancialManagementStrategy

Overall Development Strategy

 13.    InJanuary 2006, the government completed its I-ANDsand presented it together
with the Afghanistan Compact to the international community. This strategy builds on
earlier achievements, notably the National Development Framework (April 2002) and the
report "Securing Afghanistan's Future" (March 2004). The I-ANDs i s anchored in a
vision for Afghanistan "to consolidate peace and stability through just, democratic
processes and institutions, and to reduce poverty and achieve prosperity through broad
based and equitable economic growth."              These development objectives are consistent
with the Millennium Development Goals' national targets adopted by the Cabinet in
2005. The strategy i s structured around three pillars: (i)       security; (ii)governance, rule o f
law and human rights; and (iii)      economic and social development.

 14.    The Afghanistan Compact commits the Islamic Republic o f Afghanistan and the
international community to work toward a stable Afghanistanthrough good governance
and bases the Compact on a number o f principles that bear on PFM including: fiscal
sustainability, lasting Afghan capacity and effective state and civil society institutions,
combating corruption, and ensuring public transparency and accountability (Box 1.1).

       Box 1.1: AfghanistanCompactBenchmarksfor FinancialManagement
By end-2007, the Government will ensure improvedtransparent financial management at the central and
provincial levels through establishing and meeting benchmarks for financial managementagreed with and
monitoredby the internationalcommunity, including those in the anticipated PRGF. In turn and in line
with improved government accountability, donors will make every effort to increase the share of total
externalassistanceto Afghanistan that goes to the Core Budget.

Afghanistan will achieve, and then maintain, externaldebt sustainability by end-2007.


PublicFinancialManagementStrategy

15.     The government realizes that the reforms o f the PFM system that have already
begun will have to continue for it to meet the challenges o f the next years. As the
custodian o f the PFM, the MOF has prepared a Strategic Plan for the years 1384-89
(2006-2010) that proposes reforms that could produce both greater efficiency in
managing public resources (turnout) and maintaining the standards for oversight and
governance that have been achieved.

16.     These reforms set goals and a short term work agenda for: (i)             mobilizing revenue
and managing government finances; (ii)           supporting economic management and growth;
(iii)managing "public wealth;" (iv) promotinggood governance; and(v) establishing
itself as a "best practice leader" in public sector reform. The action plan for the
immediate future covering 18 months seeks to correct some o f the more immediate
deficiencies in budget formulation and execution; procurement throughout the public
sector; financial controls, accounting, reporting, audit and public accountability; and
structural and administrative reform o f the MOF, provincial administrations and the


                                                   12

financial management (FM) capabilities o f line ministries.Annual progress reviews were
expected to identify further actions for makingincremental improvements.

17.      The strategy cites, among others, the risk of development in various departments
becoming misaligned and the need for good coordination between M O F and other
ministries and agencies as a basis for extending sound PFM practices. It calls for a
participatory process for strategic planning, regular support to MOF managers and
decision-makers to assure alignment o f actions, improved management o f technical
assistance, and regularized contact and communications with partner ministries and
agencies.

18.      In 2005 the World Bank conducted a review of the PFM in Afghanistanusing a
performance measurement framework developed by the PEFA partnership program5
which identifies a set o f critical objectives o f a PFM system and a standard set o f high-
level PFM indicators to assess performance against those objectives.

19.      The assessment considered as part o f the PFM arrangements the significant
external support (both advisory and operational) provided to the government in
procurement, treasury and audit as well as the work o f the ARTF's Monitoring Agent.

20.      This assessment generally portrays a public sector where financial resources are,
by and large, being used for the intended purposes as authorized by a budget which is
processed with transparency and has contributed to aggregate fiscal discipline. The
expenditures and financial position are reported regularly in an understandable format.
However, performance regarding the allocation o f spending across programs and
agencies and the efficiency of operations i s not as good.

21.       Since the assessment the government enacted the Public Finance and Expenditure
Management Law with robust reporting requirements on public finances and a
commitment to independent review by the Auditor General. This has been matched by
the government's full and timely publishingo f its monthly statement o fbudgetexecution
on the MOF web site. Similarly, all large procurement opportunities are widely published
andthe outcomes are also widely shared.

22.      The study led to an outline o f a "Road Map for PFM reform" which coincides
with the MOF agenda which also calls for maintaining the reform effort as a managed
process through a special unit within the ministry.

                               11. IDA'SRESPONSEAND STRATEGY

A. IDA'SRecentSupport for PFM

23.      IDA has supported the establishment and functioning of a sound PFM system
since the launching of the Afghanistan InterimAdministration in 2002. It has done this
through two sets of complementary operations; through three operations providing PSIB
(Box 2.1) which have focused on making progress in establishing an enabling legal
framework for institutional development; and three investment operations; the
Emergency Public Administration Project (EPAP, US$l0.0 million, GRTD-H0060); the
Second Emergency Public Administration Project (SEPAP, US$8.4 million, GRTD-H
0550); and the Public Administration Capacity Building project (PACB, US$27.0
million, GRTD-H 1440) (Table 2.1). Additionally, the Strengthening Financial
Management Capacity Project (TF052735-AF) funded through the ARTF also provided
supportto the PFMreforms.

24.      The basic objective of these grants has beento assist the GOA to make good and
transparent use of public sector resources inthe post conflict environment. This has been
done by puttinginplace additional capacity to perform critical PFM operations, initiating
the process of developing indigenous capacity to perform these functions and beginning
the developmentofbroaderreforms inthe public administration.

                               Box 2.1: Linkagewith PSIB Series
Institution-buildingis at the core of the objectives of the PSIBs and significant achievements have been
made under PSIB Iand 11, which are further advanced in the proposed PSIB 111. The program supports
improvements in the PFM legal framework; specifically civil service, procurement and financial
management laws were enacted. The program also supports improvements in budget management
processes and budget execution; all PSIB operations have supported the adoption of annual budgets,
anchoredin a macroeconomic framework; the program is also linkedto a tightening of fiduciary standards.
Beyond the change in the regulatory framework, the program supported reforms in payroll management,
procurement, and internal and external audit. Inparticular, for the first time, the government submittedto
Parliament its annual accountswith an external audit review, aprior action for PSIB111.
Another prior action for PSIB 111is the commitment to a PFM action plan by the government. The plan
follows the format of the roadmap which accompaniedthe Afghanistan PEFA review of 2005 and provides
steps to be taken inthe short andmediumterm. The steps in the following areas will be assisted directlyby
the Public FinancialManagement Reform (PFMR) project: budget execution with the AFMIS expansion,
internal control with the implementationof the accounting manual and duty specific training for Treasury
and line ministry financial managementstaff, internal audit and external with capacity building and work
practices development, payroll with systems development, procurement and accounting and reportingwith
capacity building and direct operations support, accountability through the support for a public accounts
committee in Parliament, and with monitoring of progress on reforms with the support to the Reform

25.      With this support the government-wide procurement and financial management
arrangements satisfied the fiduciary requirements for the Bank's general budget support
and the ARTF contribution to the recurrent budget. Moreover, it enabled the Bank and

         other donors to rely entirely on the government-wide treasury and audit systems for the
         financial management o f investment operations.

         26.                                       The PACB project continues the operational support through consultant services
         to assure that basic public finance functions (procurement, treasury and audit) were
         performed so as to meet internationally accepted standards. The terms o f reference for
         these consultants also contained references to providing training but this was not the
         principle mandate. However, the scope o f its activities was broadened to include: (i)
         developing the regulatory and institutional framework in these core fiduciary
         management areas; (ii)                                                                                             further systems development that is based on a full understanding
         o f medium-term requirements and the country's implementation capacity; and
          (iii)                   capacity building and training not only in the central agencies but also in line
         ministries and the provinces so that staff could maintain and operate systems
         independently and effectively. However, this set o f activities was not well identified in
         the original design. Given the difficulties infilling positions inthe Treasury Department
         with adequate national staff and the late mobilization o f training consultants for
         prospective auditors, the project objectives were modified in late 2006 to align with the
         principle outcomes o f the activities which were the maintenance o f fiduciary
         performance.

         27.                                          During the period 2002 to the present, donors have provided continuous
         financing for the recovery program and are pledged to continue this support. While the
         government, with World Bank and other donor technical assistance on PFM, has been
         largely successful in maintaining a stable and transparent fiscal environment, there
         continues to be general concern that the demands for procurement, treasury operations,
         budget formulation and implementation, internal and external audit, and legislative
         oversight could exceed the PFM abilities o f the MOF and agencies usingpublic funds.

        28.                                       There are a number o f lessons from the Implementation Completion Report o f
        EPAP 1, the mid-term review o f EPAP I1 and the restructuring o f the PACB project that
        the government and IDA have built into the proposed project.


                                                                                                                                                                                                                              15

*  For an emergency operation to be effective in a severely damaged post-
    conflict environment, intensive Bank supervision i s essential.

   Contracts for direct operations support need to be separated from capacity
   building activities to ensure that both are performed simultaneously.
   Under the EPAPs, initial capacity building suffered greatly due to the
   pressures to get the operations up and running quickly and keep them
   runninginan environment of constant flux.

   The expectations for capacity buildingand institutional strengthening need
   to be closely aligned with the availability and skills levels o f the
    government counterparts. All assumptions regarding the availability and
    capability o f government counterpart staff need to be documented and
    validated with great care and revisitedover time.

   The government needs to continue to engage the services of the advisors
    for as long as it takes to build sufficient, demonstrable capacity in core
   public administration areas even as the roles o f the advisors become
   increasingly transitional. The legal framework for financial management
   and procurement in Afghanistan i s now more demanding and poses
   significant new challenges to the government.

   Treasury, Procurement and Audit Departments are all still dependent on
   external advisors to perform the key tasks; where nationals are involved in
   critical matters, these are involved as local advisors and not civil servants.
   This is a consequence o f incomplete restructuring and the failure to move
   to merit based recruitment.

   The systems to support budgetexecution are inplace inthe MOF butthere
    i s no functionality offered under the AFMIS to support operations by the
   line ministries (ie., budget preparation, contract and grant management,
   purchasing and asset management, and personnel management) which are
   all critical to improved service delivery.

   Reform in the MOF i s monitored by a unit in the Deputy o f
   Administration but the cross cutting issues o f the organization o f the
   ministry, human resources and the monitoring and evaluation of the
   reform's progress do not get sufficient high level attention to achieve the
   implementationo f the ministry's strategic plan.

B. Objectives,Rationaleand Strategyfor IDA's ContinuingSupport

IDA'sReformStrategy

29.     Inthe context ofthe recently concluded agreement on the I-ANDSand the 2007-
2010 Compact, donors and GOA have agreed that providing that the level of
transparency, accountability and good governance that has been achieved to date under
the preceding donor support operations for MOF i s maintained, that there should be a
progressive transfer o f responsibility for managing the PFM systems to the MOF and
away from reliance on the ARTF Monitoring Agent and the operations advisors for
procurement, treasury and audit.       This transition should proceed at a pace that is
consistent with the MOF and line ministries' capacity to resolve regulatory,
organizational and personnel management issues affecting sustainability. As the
administrator for one major source o f financing for the I-ANDs (ARTF) and a major
provider o f financing for both the operations and development budgets, IDA has a
particular responsibility to lead inthis effort.

30.     The broad plan for making this transition would be: (i)continuing to provide
operational support for basic operations through the services o f internationally recruited
firms, while (ii)makingfurther steps to re-organize the MOF and line ministriesina more
de-concentrated PFM system; (iii)deepening the regulatory framework and building
humanresource capacity to facilitate mainstreaming o foperations; and (iv) managing these
changesto assure their longer term sustainability. The strategy would encompass all o fthe
major functions o f the MOF and require the coordination o f the contributions o f several
donors. Therefore, as part o f the strategy, leadership for managing the transition would be
placed inthe M O F ina specialized Reform ImplementationManagement Unit (RIMU)that
reports directly to the Minister o f Finance. This would place the ownership and
accountability for progress with the MOF. Lastly, the rate at which the transition can be
made will depend on variables and circumstances that cannot be fully accounted for ex
ante. Therefore, the implementationo f the transition and the programming o f resources to
support it would be made through annual progress and program reviews, supported by third
party "reviewers," reporting to the RIMU (see sub-component 3.1.6 o f the Detail Project
Description).

31.     This broad plan i s largely consistent with the vision which M O F has developed
and the World Bank recommendations in "Managing Public Finance for Development."
These aimed at guidingthe M O F inidentifying and implementing a wide range o f actions
required for strengthening its current functions and capacities and moving forward from
meetingthe emergency needs o f the last four years toward a modem and effective public
financial management organization.

  33.                                    Inthe next phase o f its support for PFM, IDA'Svalue added would be to buildon
  the experience it has had through the series o f projects cited above which donors have
  acknowledged as substantial. It would then provide additional leadership in coordinating
  donor assistance beingprovided intheir respective areas o f competence from its position
  as administrator o f the ARTF.

  Linkagewith PublicAdministrationReform

  34.                                    The proposed project is one element of a wider public administration reform
  agenda that has been developed by the government, with IDNARTF support to
  contribute to a more effective state through better PFM performance and by building
  capacity to sustain this performance (Box 2.2). To date, in the same projects that have
  contributed to maintaining sound PFM, IDA has also provided major support for the
  restructuring o f agencies and ministries and rationalizing the functions and job
  descriptions o f public sector employees in order to pursue operational efficiencies o f
   service delivery that lead to improved developmental outcomes from public expenditures.
  In restructuring agencies, attention is being placed on establishing reliable financial
  management units that would receive the training and capacity being decentralized from
  the MOF. Major re-structuring o f the MOF itself has been part o f this effort. The focus o f
  the Public Administration Reform (PAR) is now being directed towards reform of civil
  service practices in a new Civil Service Reform (CSR) project, whose objective i s to
  increase personnel performance                                                                                                                                                                      through incentives,                                            merit-basedhiring, good
  management, and competency enhancement. Consideringthat personnel costs account for




                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    18

about 30% o f the MTFF (about 62% o f the ordinary budget), gains in this area will be
significant for controlling costs and increasing expenditure effectiveness.

35.      Together with the CSR project, the Public Financial Management Reform
(PFMR) project helps strengthen core business practices within government, namely
human resource and financial management - through appropriate regulatory,
organizational and technical reforms.             Reforms in these areas should provide the
supporting organizational environment within which more sector-specific reforms can be
effective. Both projects support the achievement of specific triggers under PSIB as well
as benchmarks under the Afghanistan Compact.                      Both projects also support the
Government's anti-corruption strategy through identifying and addressing areas that are
vulnerable to corruption and through promoting a rules-based culture within government.

36.      Therefore through these two operations, the CSR project and the proposed PFMR
project, IDA will contribute to the government's overall ability to execute two
interlockedbusiness practices -public financial management andpersonnel management.

    Box 2.2: Linkageswith IDNARTF's Public Administration Reform Initiatives
A significant piece of analytical work is underway to assist the government to define priorities and
programs in Public Administration Reform. This will include specific areas of work on: how to deepen
line ministry reforms, the evolution of sub-nationalgovernance over time, and strengtheninginstitutions of
accountability. Work is progressing to define an integrated program of activities and mechanisms for
managingresources ina coordinatedway.
As part of defining work programsunder this broaderPAR framework, IDA has assistedthe governmentin
defining a realistic implementationplan for achieving its civil service reform goals in line with Compact
benchmarks. This has beenpresentedto donors for support at the April Afghanistan DevelopmentForum.
A major work program i s underway with IDA and other donor support to assist the government develop its
anticorruption strategy and to identify areas where improvements could limit the vulnerability to
corruption, including inthe area ofpublic administrationreform.
The ARTF financed Management Capacity Program is supporting the interim buying-in of Afghan
consultants into civil service positions to manage core common function departments while broader
capacitybuilding efforts take hold.

                              111. THEPROPOSED       PROJECT

A. Project Objective

37.     The objectives o f the project are to: (i)develop an efficient and effective public
financial management system; and (ii)   develop the humanresource capacity o f the MOF
and CAO to ensure better operation o f public financial management.

38.     Indicators for monitoring these performance objectives would correspond closely
to those used inthe recently completed PEFA analysis and would include: (i)     the degree
o f coherence o f budget, treasury and revenue estimates with ANDs priorities and MTFF;
(ii)thetimeliness ofbudget,treasury andrevenuepreparation andexecution; (iii)the
number of ministriedagencies successfully managing elements o f the procurement and
treasury functions with ex post control; (iv) measures o f good governance such as the
trend of the percentage of donor support transiting MOF core budget processes; and
(v) the quality of governmental audit. The project's impact would also be observed inthe
proportion o f the national budgetthat was being managed under improved line ministries
and Mustofiats, and eventually, an improvement in the rates o f implementation of
budgets that are beingmade available.

B. Detailed Project Description

39.     The PFMR project will be implemented over a period o f three years and will
contain the following components.

        1.INSTITUTIONALDEVELOPMENT (US$11.4million)

40.     The project would assist each ofthe major departments within MOF and the CAO
to develop and implement the structures, procedures and systems required to carry out
their mandates under the new PFM legal framework. The legal framework is now ahead
o f the procedures and systems to support it. The project would also assist the Treasury
Department with systems development, would assist MOF finish the procedures for
procurement, and would develop work practices for government audit.

        1.1ProcurementInstitutionalDevelopmentand SocialAccountability

41.     In order to cope with the urgent task of reconstruction in Afghanistan,
arrangements were put inplace under EPAP to provide `centralized' technical assistance
by means o f operations support to advisors for procurement under the Procurement Unit
o f the ARDS. ARDS managed the Procurement Advisor and recruited and trained 10
local counterpart staff as Procurement Liaison Officers who serve as liaisons with the line
ministries with an objective to ensure transfer o f procurement capacity and responsibility
to the line ministries. The Procurement Advisor also initiated a training program,
conducted a review o f procurement legislation, and prepared draft new legislation which
was finally adopted in September 2005 as the new Procurement Law inAfghanistan.




                                            20

42.      The PACB project responded to the needto transfer procurement capacity as well
as responsibility for procurement functions to the line ministries o f the government. This
required institutional development as the core component o f the procurement reform
initiative. While some o f the capacity development assistance envisaged flowed from the
Bank's previous intervention and impliedfurther training o f targeted individuals, the core
objective o f the overall plan was to develop institutional capacity. The capacity
development program was predicated on a gradual transfer of procurement responsibility
to the purchasing entities based on their demonstrated ability to house and make use o f
trained and experienced procurement officers.

43.     The services required as part o f the procurement component o f PACB comprise:
(i)a sustainable nationwide capacity building strategy to take into account the
requirements not only o f central government but also provincial and municipal
government as well as the private sector; (ii)a program to assist and facilitate the
achievement o f PRR status for a number o f key purchasers at central and sub-central
level; (iii)planto transfer procurement capacity and responsibility to those central and
           a
sub-central purchasers according to a set o f milestones; and (iv) a system o f attestation
whereby the performance o f ministries can be assessed against identified benchmarks as
part o f the milestone mechanism. The objective was twofold: to build the capacity o f
procurement officers o f the client, its key purchasing ministries, and provincial authorities;
and to strengthen the organizational structure of the procurement function within procuring
entities with a view to transfening responsibility for procurement from ARDS to the
procuring entities themselves.

44.     In 2005, as part of the broader review of Afghanistan's PFM system, an
assessment o f procurement procedures and performance focused on the legal framework
applicable to the conduct o f procurement inAfghanistan as well as on the performance o f
those responsible for applying the procurement procedures was carried out in 2005. The
study confirmed the scope o f procurement reform and capacity building activities under
the PACB to: (i)create a Procurement Policy Unit (PPU); (ii)        finalize and approve the
Procurement Law and draft regulations to implement it; (iii)develop and implement a
large scale capacity-building program for procurement officers in the government; and
(iv) create a training program for the local private sector to enhance its capacity to
participate inbids.

45.     Under the PACB project, a PPU has been established under the MOF, a new
Public Procurement Law has been adopted, the procurement regulations have been
drafted, and a system has been established whereby all bidding opportunities as well as
contract awards are published in the ARDS procurement website.             However, due to
various reasons, the government could not complete selection o f a consultant for
procurement reform support (Procurement Capacity Building and Legal & Institutional
Framework Development) in due course. The process o f selection has recently been
completed and the contract with the procurement support consultant was signed in
February 2007. Since only a few months o f project duration are remaining for PACB,
this component o f procurement reform, which commences under PACB, would continue to
be the central planko fthe procurement reforminitiative under the PFMRproject.



                                              21

46.     In addition to assisting government purchasers in this way, the project will
provide institutional support for the newly created regulatory body (PPU). The PPU
requires direct assistance to carry out its functions (listed inthe Procurement Law). They
will have started down the path o f creating an information website and a basic
Management Information System (MIS) for procurement. This, however, requires
significant further input to provide a useful tool. The PPU will also have many other tasks
which will require funding, not least in respect o f the adoption o f secondary legislation
(including guidelines and manuals) and the dissemination o f information and analysis o f
data so that they can provide reports indicating the successes and failures o f the system.
The project will therefore include funds for the PPU to: (i)retain consultants to create
more Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs), a procurement manual and guidance notes;
(ii)develop the website andinteractive MIS; and(iii) the PPUfor publication,
                                                             assist
analysis and dissemination o f review panelprocedures, documentation and decisions. The
MIS to be developed for procurement will provide a database of procurement
requirements by contracting entity and track the procurement process of large
procurements to the stage o f contract award and supports the publication o f procurement
information. The AFMIS expansion will include a Purchases module which controls the
payment o f contracts once awarded (see sub-component 1.2).

Accountability and Disclosure

47.     Given the significant changes in the legal and regulatory framework and the
traditionally passive public response to expenditure on procurement, there is an initial needto
encourage greater public awareness o f the changes to the procurement rules and to promote
change inbehavior. The immediate needis to design aneffective and strategic communication
and procurement disclosure strategy, taking into account the specific circumstances that
prevail in the country. To better support the transition and its related capacity building
exercise, an effective communication component will be designed to raise awareness o f the
reform agenda and its implications within: (i) government (politicians, parliamentarians,
                                                the
andpublic officials); (ii) private sector (bidders, consultants suppliers, etc.); and (iii)
                          the                                                               civil
society at large (academia, non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations,
civilians). This component andthe awareness it will raise should also mitigate risks o f failure
by ensuring a wider constituency is reached, ownership creation, and dealingwith corruption
through a sound, efficient and transparent procurement process. Putting procurement out in
the openwithincivil society will also set the stage for possible future inclusion ofcivil society
in the procurement function as an oversight element once the GOA has come up with its
strategyon anti-corruption.

48.     Inthe medium term, it is important not to lose sight of the opportunity to start
work on social accountability initiatives. Efforts will be made to discover the most
appropriate means o f educating and including civil society in the monitoring o f the
procurement function.        This should, however, be preceded by a situational
analysidassessment that would allow the development o f such a longer term strategy.




                                              22

49.     In light of this gradual approach, the project will retain a consultant for a
communications and awareness strategy (housed within PPU) and a consultant for
situational analysis/assessmentinrespect o fpossibilities for social accountability measures.

        1.2 Treasury SystemsDevelopment and Roll-out

50.     Over the past four years, an integrated financial management system has been
implemented in the Treasury o f the MOF. The basic objective o f this system was to
ensure accountability over the Governments budget and expenditures including the use o f
donor funds. The system was not intendedto be a complete integrated MIS that would be
capable o f serving the needs o f all government managers. It was basically a Treasury
system with FreeBalance software as the core application o f the system known as the
AFMIS.

51.     As the government is moving forward with their reform program, the AFMIS
needs to be enhanced to meet the increasing demands on the Treasury staff as well as line
ministries and Mustofiats. The software platform for AFMIS i s FreeBalance, the systems
study carried out under the PACB project recommended keeping this platform given the
knowledge acquired and the reasonably good performance o f the core applications o f
expenditure module, general ledger, allotments, bank reconciliations and financial
reporting. These core applications give Treasury all the means to effect payments, keep
control by allotment, and report incompliance with the law and donor requirements.

52.     The expansion should respond to the needs o f line ministrieswhere there is a need
to automate control by contract and develop controls by grant. Given that the
procurement capacity building contract will develop a procurement MIS to automate and
control the process leading up to the selection and award o f a contract, the PFMR should
provide an application for the contract control. A Purchasing Module would provide this
functionality. Similarly, the PFM law requires that each line ministry keeps a register o f
its fixed assets; giventhis and the integration provided between a Purchasing Module and
a FixedAsset Module, the AFMIS expansion should comprise Purchasing and the Fixed
Assets Module. Similarly, the recording o f revenue would be rendered more secure
through the use o f the Accounts Receivable Module.

53.     A fully automated off-the-shelve HumanResources (HR)MISfor implementation
inMOF is also considered necessary. At present, MOF uses the Microsoft Access based
payroll system known as Verified Payroll Program which includes the Computerized
Payroll System. Nevertheless, there i s no HR functionality inthe system and the support
and documentation o f in-house systems i s not optimum. The ultimate goal for HR MIS i s
to direct deposit the net pay to each employee's bank account and provide the critical
personnel data for eventual centralizationand determination o f pensionliabilities.

54.     A principle o f systems implementation which the team and the government
agreed i s to have same vendor applications for all integrated operations (i.e., operations
where individual transactions from the modules are required to be posted to other




                                             23

applications). Following from this it was decided that FreeBalance Purchasing, Fixed
Assets, and possibly HR Modules would be acquired to address the needs identified.

55.     The systems study recommends the implementation o f a budget support
management system as a highpriority. Whether the FreeBalance module meets the needs
or whether another vendor's product should be used will be determined following the
study tour by the MOF's budget and treasury officials to review the performance of HR
and BudgetPreparation Modules installed inother government settings. The same vendor
principle i s not critical in this case because the Budget Preparation Module and core
accountability applications are not integrated but just interfaced with a periodic file
submission for loading the budget and updates. The systems integrator consultant
selected for the Treasury system will program the interface for the periodic uploading o f
the budget files to AFMIS and down loading o f allotment and expenditure information.

56.     Therefore, the project would engage a firm o f consultants for up to 36 months to
acquire, install, and train national staff in the use o f the following modules from
FreeBalance in order to complete the expanded financial management functions in
AFMIS - Procurement, Fixed Assets, and Accounts Receivable. The Budget Preparation
andHRModule vendor selection will be decided subsequently.

57.     To conduct their designated business affairs and be partners with the MOF in
distributing the growing administrative responsibilities, line ministries will require the
ability to enter transactions into AFMIS and to approve such transactions through the
Financial Controllers (Treasury staff) located within the line ministries. The project
would support the roll-out o f the AFMIS so that transaction processing and payment
authorizationmay be decentralized but that payment processing would remain centralized
withinTreasury andthe Mustofiats. This component will assist the government inrolling
out AFMIS to five or six line ministries which currently account for the majority o f
public sector non-military and non-policing functions as well as six Mustofiats. The
selection o f line ministries will be made by Treasury and Budget Departments after
considering the capacity and impact o f the roll-out. The pre-conditions for the roll-out
include the reform o f the Administration Department o fthe line ministry to a point where
staff are under the PRR, the organization and duties o f all financial management staff are
clear and documented and the line ministry enters into a written understanding with the
MOF on its obligations for the roll-out and using AFMIS, and the line ministry provide
the infrastructure to allow the installation of the terminals. Inaddition to the full roll-out
to six line ministries, the consultant will assist the government in rolling out just the
reporting module o fthe AFMIS to additional line ministries.

        1.3Internal Audit Work Practices

58.     To date the internal audit activities in line ministries and agencies have been
under the control o f the CAO and have been oriented towards detecting frauds and
irregularities by line ministries' staffs. The Public Expenditure and Financial
Management (PEFM) Law and its financial regulations have transferred control o f




                                             24

internal audit from the CAO to the MOF by providing that the MOF appoint internal
auditors to audit the financial and accounting affairs o f all state administrations.

59.     Initial steps have been taken under the PACB project to build a modem Internal
Audit Department in the MOF, including the recruitment o f more accounting specialists
and initial training o f recruits ininternal auditing techniques, and the formation o f a high
level Audit Committee to oversee the department's work. Steps being undertaken by a
consultant appointed under PACB include preparing an internal audit manual, various
audit procedures for financial functions, and work programs for internal audits within the
MOF.

60.     The project would now support implementation of the expanded MOF
responsibility through development o f improved audit methodology and training. The
project would also finance further development and roll-out o f internal audit procedures
and plans to the line ministries and provinces, and to improve the capacities of the
internal audit staff through on thejob training.

61.     The consultant will be hired to provide work practice tools and on-the-job training
to the cadre o f internal auditors that are engaged inproviding internal audit services inthe
MOF and the line ministries. Work practice tools will be developed inthe form o f a new
internal audit manual that covers the requirements o f Financial Regulations 11.5 to 11.10
including issues o f internal audit organization, management, planning, conduct, reporting,
and follow-up. The on-the-job training will involve leading the auditors inthese ministries
incarrying out and reporting some 80 major investment projects (selected on the basis of
their value and implementation complexity that could disguise fraud) during the period of
the engagementto buildproficiencies to levels that accord with International Internal Audit
standards.

62.     The CAO has undertaken a significant number o f audits that have identified
possible malfeasance and the Auditor General has referred cases to the Attorney General
for possible prosecution. There i s a need for similar findings by internal auditors to be
referred to a fraud investigation unit prior to consideration o f prosecution or disciplinary
action. The component will assist with establishing a fraud investigation unit in the
MOF's Internal Audit Department, developing and launching its basic operational skills,
and preparing a roadmap for developing specialist fraud investigation processes in
Afghanistan.

        1.4 Supportfor ExternalAudit

1.4.1 Advisory Services

63.     The CAO is reforming its organization, methods and operations. Major training
efforts are inprocess to improve the skills o f the audit staff. The CAO, with World Bank
funding, has used a professionalaccounting firm to provide guidance to the CAO inthese
matters and there i s a need for a senior advisor to the Auditor General on a full-time basis
to continue improving the CAO's performance and to build capacity to fulfill its mandate



                                              25

underthe law. A new Audit Law is inpreparation and the advisor will be neededto assist
with implementation o f new audit manuals and training the CAO in functions set out in
the PEFM and draft Audit Laws.

64.     The project would finance the services of a senior audit advisor for policy
guidance which has beenongoing since 2006 and strengthening o f the CAO which would
allow the direct operations advisor firm to concentrate on delivering audit services. The
advisor would be supported by three audit experts available on a full time basis to work
as audit team leaders and provide on-the-job training to the CAO staff.

1.4.2 ExternalAudit Developmentof PhysicalInfrastructure
                       -
65.     The CAO has moved to new accommodations and requires improved physical
infrastructure for their operations.       The project would finance improved physical
infrastructure including the Information Technology Center, office furnishings and on-
line access to AFMIS. The CAO has identified its requirements including computers and
relevant software for the field and central audit staff, necessary terminals to connect with
the AFMIS to support more efficient auditing, appropriate Computer Assisted Audit
Techniques, office furniture, and work stations.

1.4.3 ExternalAudit ParliamentaryOversight
                       -

66.     The project will support operationalizing the recent decision to establish the
Parliamentary Oversight Committee function, and reinforce and reinvigorate the
accountability o f the Executive in the management o f public finances to the legislature
through a timely, comprehensive, and methodical review o f audit reports and audited
accounts o f the government.

67.     Exposure to a well tested system o f legislative scrutiny o f public spending in the
context o f a similar political system will help to create awareness o f international best
practice, and provide the Committee Chairman and Auditor General with much needed
knowledge and understanding of: (i)      a tested approach to the timely processing o f audit
reports and accounts; (ii)   constitution and powers (including understanding o f member
nomination procedures, tabling o f schedules, nominating a Chair); and (iii)means
through which to promote accountability and transparency. This sub-component will be
managed by the CAO and provide management assistance, training, and operating
support to build the capacity o f members o f the parliamentary committee in their
oversight function as well as supporting secretariat and technical assistance aimed at
strengtheningthe administrative support to the committee.

        2. HUMANRESOURCESCAPACITYDEVELOPMENT (US$5.0 million)

68.     The transfer o f skills to civil servants to operate PFM systems lies at the heart o f
sustainability o f adequate PFM performance. Under this component, the project would
provide consultants, training opportunities, and materials for the development o f skills o f
MOF staff, line ministry staff, and CAO staff. In selecting staff for training, which in



                                               26

turnleadsto advancement, the MOF and the CAO will be sensitive to and follow gender-
sensitive policies.

69.     Given a three-year project life, it is not expected that the MOF and the CAO
would acquire the full range and level o f skills to assume complete responsibility to
operate unaided all the PFM systems by the end o f project date. However, while the exact
end-state i s not known at this time, advances along the continuum will be treated as solid
progress inthe right direction.

70.     By project end, however, the MOF staff will have acquired the skills to interpret
and apply the PFM laws and regulations for dealing with the routine and current state o f
budget execution, reporting and control. The nature o f the technical assistance will
transition away from direct operations support as capacity grows. While some direct
operations support will be required for the maintenance and further development o f the
AFMIS, most technical assistance beyond the current project would be for policy
formulation and implementing further reforms.

71.     Similarly, the CAO will have progressed to a point where its staff can conduct
routine review o f compliance and simple project financial statement audits with the
assistance o f an external audit manager to ensure adherence to current auditing standards.
Beyond the project life direct assistance would be required for conducting audit o f State
Owned Enterprises and complex projects, while the state budget audit could be done with
the limitedinvolvement o f an audit advisor for quality control purposes. As inthe case of
MOF beyond the current project, technical assistance would be required for policy
formulation and implementingfurther reforms.

72.     The capacity o f line ministry staff to carry out procurement should, on the other
hand, advance to a point where at least in the targeted ministries this staff will assume
responsibility for procurement with the mandated supervision o fthe PPUo f MOF.

        2.1 Human Resource CapacityDevelopmentin Procurement

73.     Interms o f individual training needs, the continuing need to provide purchasing
entities with a competent cadre o f procurement officers will be fulfilled through the
continuation o f the training programs developed initially by the procurement agents
retained under EPAP I.The training activities o f the procurement capacity building
contract outlined in sub-component 1.1 will be delivered under this sub-component and
will be rolled-out more widely, especially to local government entities as well as to
specialist audiences such as decision makers and auditors. Further effort will be made to
ensure that there i s a private sector able to respond adequately to (and, where necessary,
challenge) the public purchaser in the changed procurement environment. The training
needs at sub-central level will be identifiedthrough the training needs assessment.

74.     As a result and inaddition to continuing with the existing training program under
the PACB project, this project will provide more training at sub-central level, more




                                              27

private sector workshops, specific training programs for the PPU staff, and a training
program for dispute panels.

        2.2 Human Resource CapacityDevelopmentin Financial Management

75.     This sub-component will assist the MOF Treasury Department and the
administration departments o f selected line ministries in developing staff capacity in
financial management functions. The program would be based on the training needs
assessment that was conducted in 2006 for Treasury in the PACB project and additional
training needs assessments may be conducted in the line ministries to be engaged inthe
decentralization process. Training in line ministries will be done in close coordination
with the Budget Department to take any opportunity joint training with assistance
provided by the Budget Department. Up to 200 staff could be affected. In addition to
providing trainers and materials for duty specific training, for developing a pool o f staff
with higher accounting skills, the project will also provide funds to reimburse Treasury
staff for attending classes conducted by private entities such as the ACCA.

        2.3 Human Resource CapacityDevelopmentin Audit

76.     The project would complete the classroom training inintroductory accounting and
auditingthat beganunder the PACB project for the first batch o f internal auditors o f the
MOF and staff o f the CAO. Additionally, a stream o f internal auditors and CAO auditors
intended to provide leadership and more expert skills will be financed for advanced
training. The Association o f Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) professional
accountant training now available in Kabul could be used for this purpose for staff who
would become senior leaders in the Internal Audit Department and CAO. Selection o f
officers for this training should be based on career development plans and the likelihood
that they can contribute over the mid-term to development o f the Internal Audit
Department and the CAO.

        3. REFORMMANAGEMENT (US$1.0 million)

77.     The processes o f coordinating support for improvements in M O F functions and
for assuring the improvements are well aligned across departments and with other line
ministriesandMustofiats would be managedthrough a newly-formed RIMU.The RIMU
would be responsible for developing annual work plans which would assure the
coordination o f actions proposed in various departments, monitoring implementationo f
these actions so that the overall results o f the project and the M O F strategic plan are
achieved. This latter function has been initiated by the MOF. It would also be responsible
for assuring that new personnel policies for the civil service being developed and
supported by the Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission
(IARCSC) are properly integratedinto the MOF's own HR management department.

78.     While it i s important that there be continuity in applying actions to improve
performance, the RIMUwould be treated as a "task force" with a finite life and not as a
permanentline agency o f the MOF. Throughthis arrangement the MOF managerialteam
(minister, deputy ministers, and director generals) would be provided with options and


                                             28

alternatives for making further improvements in overall ministerial functionality. The
work o f the RIMU would also allow the management o f the M O F to conclude
arrangements with other line ministries and Mustofiats covering their roles and
responsibilities in implementing de-concentrated PFM functions. To meet its objectives,
the RIMUwould undertake the following tasks.

         3.1.1 TargetedRestructuring of Internal MOF BusinessArrangements

79.      The RIMU would assure that the various fhctions and relationships between
targeted MOF departments were organized to be mutually supporting inproviding efficient
PFM. It would draw on the support beingoffered through the IARCSC (being supported by
an IDA grant supporting reforms inthe civil service) to rapidly reviewandrevise, as needed,
decisions made under the PRR for the allocation o f functional responsibilities, lines of
authority and reporting, and the level and types o f staffing required to exercise these
functions. The IARCSC with financing o f the CSR project would assist the MOF/RIMU to
acquire the services o f an internationally recognized expert inthe operations o f macro-level
public finance institutions such as ministries o f finance, treasury boards, central banking
institutions to diagnose intra-institutional organizational issues inthe MOF, propose solutions
andsupport their implementation over aperiodofabout 36 months.

80.      The RIMUwould then work with department heads and staff to implement any
restructuring that is recommended. It would pursue a "change                    management"
methodology that would involve the participation o f the staff that would be affected in
understanding the rationale for changes, receive feedback on proposals and build
commitment and ownership o f changes as they came into effect.

         3.1.2 Staff Re-grading under the GOA PayIGradingPolicy

81.      The recently completed PRR process produced revised job descriptions and
statements o f qualifications for virtually all o f the MOF 220 higher level staff (grades 2
and above) and about 70% o f 5,700 lower level staff (grades 3 and below). The RIMU
would arrange with the IARCSC for applying the new grade and pay policy o f the
government with support provided through the CSR project. The IARCSC Pay and
Grade Unit would work with the RIMUand MOF HR Department to re-map the revised
job descriptions into the new %grade system, and complete the task o f defining newjob
descriptions to correspond to the new 8-grade system where this was required. Staff o f
the MOF HR Department would be trained in creating and grading job descriptions as
part o f the process. The IARCSC Pay and Grade Unit, supported by its own team o f
international experts, would then prepare confidential reports recommending the re-
assignment o f incumbents of former positions into the newly graded positions.

         3.1.3 Supportfor theHuman ResourcesManagement (HRM) Department

82.      The RIMUwould facilitate the strengtheningo f the HRMDepartment to position
it to perform new personnel management functions beingdeveloped under the GOA civil
service reform strategy. It would arrange with the IARCSC to train and mentor



                                                29

MOF/HRM staff to apply new operational procedures and manuals as they are developed
under the CSR project covering: (i) for positions graded 3 and below following
                                          hiring
merit-based practices; (ii)   assessing individualjob performance; (iii) managing personnel
assignments, re-assignments, promotions and sanctions; and (iv) applying separation
policies. Incoordination with the CSR project, the RIMU would facilitate the placement
of a human resources management expert for 36 months to assist the MOF HRh4
Department to re-organize so as to accommodate the management o f new civil service
regulations, and to mentor staff inapplying the training and new operational norms.

        3.1.4 Preparation of New Human Resources Management Initiatives

83.     The MOF would be expected to make three major strategic decisions to sustain
the effects o ftraining, pay reform, and improved personnel management:

                 Initiating "schemes o f service" to permit the M O F to be competitive in
                 recruiting and retaining professionals in selected professional streams
                 considered critical for the long term performance o f PFM fimctions withinthe
                 framework o f the new grading and pay system. While the new grade and pay
                 system would be adequate for motivating and promoting staff and rewarding
                the performance of most general civil service fimctions in the MOF, select
                professions including accounting, procurement management, government
                 auditing have special job descriptions, qualifications and certifications, and
                remuneration requirements that should be recognized if individuals in these
                 fields are to become experienced and long term public servants. The RIMU
                 and HRM Department would prepare a proposal for installing "schemes of
                 service" for these three professional categories with the assistance o f
                 international experts inthe matter, andwhen agreed, launch its application;


          0      Reducing the reliance on internationally recruited technical assistance in
                 line functions o f the MOF would be an important element in establishing
                the longer term sustainability of Afghanistan's              public financial
                 management system. The current level o f credibility o f MOF's financial
                management practices i s being assured by the extensive use o f
                 international and national contractors which is not considered to be
                 sustainable in the long run. In 2007 there are 76 full time expatriate
                 consultants and 200 "local advisors" working primarily in line duties in
                the MOF. The RIMUwould collaborate with the respective departments
                inMOF on a diagnosis of continuing needs, an inventory o fpositions that
                could be "nationalized" considering available human resource capacity,
                and a timetable for making the transfers; and


          0     Introducing gender-sensitive personnel practices. While there i s not a
                national standard for recognizing and addressing the special requirements
                o f women inthe Afghan work force, the M O F would initiate: (i)baseline
                                                                                    a
                survey to develop intelligence on the numbers and status o f women
                currently employed and diagnose issues that impede their productive



                                                30

               contributions; and (ii)  design actions that could be implemented within
               current legal constraints to remove obstacles and promote further
               participation o f women inthe MOF workforce.

        3.1.5 PFMR Project CoordinationandAdministration

84.     The RIMU would coordinate the implementation of the components of the
project. It would also coordinate through the use o f the annual work plan for MOF, the
implementation o f the PFMR project with the projects being financed in parallel, for
examplethe DFID support to the Budget Department.

85.     For the next three years, the RIMUwould assume responsibilities for day-to-day
project administration including the: (i)administration o f contracts with international
firms (including those not supported by the IDA Grant), as well as monitoring
performance under these contracts; and for (ii)project related procurement, financial
management, and accountability for safeguards. The Administration Department would
participate inthese tasks and assume control by the end o f the third project year.

        3.1.6 Monitoringand Evaluation of Results

86.     The RIMU would temporarily incorporate the MOF Monitoring and Evaluation
Unit (M&EU)to assure coherence between monitoring and evaluation of results and the
development and re-development o f reform work programs. The unit and RIMU would
produce an Annual Performance Review (APR) with emphasis on the benchmarks
contained inthe Results Framework, as well as a review o f actions that had been taken. It
would cover all reform measures undertaken inthe MOF, notjust those supported by the
PFMR project.

        4. DIRECT OPERATIONALSUPPORTFOR PFMFUNCTIONS
        (USS16.0million)

87.     The goals o f the government include maintaining appropriate fiduciary standards
to provide reasonable assurance to the Afghan public and to international donors that
government resources and donor funds are subject to appropriate budget and expenditure
controls. This has been achieved during the reconstruction period with the assistance o f
direct operations support based on internationally recruited consultant firms for
procurement, treasury and external audit. Moreover, the Mid-Term Review o f the PACB
project indicated that because o f the limited progress in progress in capacity building o f
civil service skills in PFM, there i s a need for continuing the direct operations support
under a new PFM technical assistance operation on with the World Bank. It is also
recognized that the outputs o f these contracts provide the fiduciary framework that the
government has agreed for the PSIB and for the ARTF contribution to the recurrent
budget. The PFM action plan soon to be committed to by the government is also directly
supported by the outputs o f the direct operations support contracts. By the end o f the
project, however, the nature o f support needed to procurement, treasury and audit will




                                             31

have evolved to that o f supervision, policy advice, and assistance for reform rather than
for the execution o fthe day-to-day operations.

88.      While the project's approach to direct operations support recognizes that this type
o f technical assistance i s still necessary for the medium term, it looks for this round o f
'contracts to contribute to building the skills for the Afghanistan public sector by two
means: (i)   on-the-job training for civil servants who will be acquiring basic knowledge
under the HR Development component o f this project with the direct operations
consultant firms; and (ii)   by including inthe technical assistance teams under the direct
operations support contracts a larger share o f local advisors with concrete deliverables for
the transfer o f knowledge and skills for the operation of the PFM systems. This will
contribute to a pool o f local advisors highly trained in public financial management and
provide sustainability as an alternative to international support infuture inthe form o f in-
country expertise which would complement the knowledge and skills o f the civil service.

         4.1 Direct OperationsSupportfor Procurement

89.      There are currently two forms o f direct operational support for procurement
funded by the PACB.

90.      First, the services o f a central procurement facilitation consultant directly support
line ministries with the procurement process with both procurement o f donor programs
and domestically funded procurement. The consultant works under the Ministry of
Economy (MOE) and an allowance i s included to cover operating costs o f the MOE
Procurement Unitwhile the consultant services are required.

91.     While these consultant services and support will be continued under the scope o f
the proposed project, the decentralization process envisaged through the transfer of
procurement responsibilities which i s integral to this project will mean that the need for
such direct operational support will decrease significantly over time. Six line ministries
are targeted for de-concentration o f procurement following the training and certification
under the capacity building of Component 1. Under the existing arrangement, the
procurement facilitating consultants' team is located at the ARDS; however, a different
approach is envisaged to be followed under the current proposed project whereby the
team leader o f the consultants' team will be located at the ARDS and all other key staff
will be located at the line ministries. Through this modified approach, the procurement
facilitating consultant will not only be able have better interaction with the line ministries
butwill also be able to mentor the line ministries' procurement staff.

92.     Second, the PPU within the MOF is receivingdirect support through the funding o f
its director (an international consultant) and core staff who are tasked with setting up the
PPUand makingit operational. This short term support will continue underthis component
to enable the PPU to begin its functions while a full complement o f local staff i s being
recruited andtrained inall the requiredfunctions.




                                               32

        4.2 Direct Operations Support to Treasury Operations

93.     During the reconstruction MOF has maintained high levels of accountability in
part through the assistance of a consultancy services to Treasury financed by earlier
World Bank projects. The demand for transparency and accountability for the use o f
public resources i s growing in Afghanistan and meeting the requirements for reform,
accountability and transparency will constrain the pace at which M O F can reduce its
dependence on international supported staff and contracted services. The project will
continue to provide operational support for the Treasury functions through the services o f
internationally recruited firms.

94.     Activities under this sub-component will include: operational support and on-the-
job training in accounting and reporting, cash management, payroll processing, grant
management, and payment processing as well as maintenance and operation o f AFMIS.
The contractor will put more emphasis than in the past on using local advisors and
transferring a requisite minimumlevel of skills to them to operate the PFM systems by
project end.

        4.3 Direct Operations Support to ExternalAudit

95.     The scarcity o f qualified accountants and the lack o f understanding o f financial
statement audits within the CAO have required that the audit advisor firm play a
significant role in the conduct o f audits since 2002. During this period, the CAO has
completed, with the assistance o f the audit operations advisors, the audit o f all o f the
World Bank and ARTF funded projects, and the capacity o f the CAO staff has improved
under the on-the-job training supplied by the firms during the audits. These steps have
been successful inre-establishing the CAO as a working institution capable o f absorbing
institutional strengthening assistance, but it has not developed the institution and its staff
sufficiently for them to conduct financial statement audits to international standards
without continuing professionalassistance.

96.     This sub-component will first finance the consultant services to conduct with the
CAO the external audit o f donor projects. An important objective i s achieving
compliance with the International Standards o f Auditing (ISAs).      The audit operations
advisors financed by the World Bank projects have not yet participated in audit o f the
government-wide financial statements. The passage o f the PEFM Law necessitates that
the CAO make greater use o f the advisor in these audits which should be done in
accordance with the ISAs. The firm will also assist with state budget audit during the
period o f the PFMR project.

97.     Similarly, the selection criteria for the operations advisor will consider the share
o f local advisors in the team who are following some accreditation program in
accounting. Team members are expected to acquire the core skills for audit field work by
the end o f the project life.

98.     Cost Estimates. The cost estimated for each component in Table 3.1 is based on
calculations performed by the Bank team using unit rates on contracts under the current
PACB project.

        5. POTENTIAL RISKSAND MITIGATION

99.     The PFMR project would be implementedin a high risk environment created by
an uncertain security situation and general weakness in Afghanistan's institutional
capacity for implementing operations. These risks are largely beyond the control of the
MOF. Conversely, there is a high degree of consensus among donors and officials that
reform in the MOF and the overall PFM system is critical and that there is strong
ownership by current MOF leadership of a strategy for change. Safeguards issues
(environmental, social) are not likely to arise as the project is designed to maintain
fiduciary controls while gradually introducing reforms.

100.    However, the project also faces significant implementation risks that derive from
its being essentially an institution development and capacity building operation including
those presentedinTable 3.2.

                                                AND


 101.   The PFMR project will be implemented over a period o f 36 months under the
following arrangements,

1. Governance and Management Structure

102.     The project would be implemented under the authority o f the Minister o f
Finance. He would chair and be assisted by a PFM Reform Steering Committee,
comprising senior M O F departmental managers (Treasury, Budget, Internal Audit,
Administration, PPU), a representative o f the M O E (responsible for procurement
operations support) and a representative o f the CAO to maintain focus on results, good
communications, a consolidated view o f the reform, and any necessary policy and
regulatory improvements. This committee i s a successor to the advisory committee
overseeing the PACB.

103.    Daily operations o f the project would be organized and coordinated for a newly
formed RIMU.The RIMUwould report to the Minister and assist him as the "secretariat"
for deliberations o f the PFM Reform Steering Committee. This practice would follow, in
effect, that already employed by the M&EU monitoring the implementationo f the MOF
Strategic Plan. The specific roles o f the RIMUwould be to: (i)   prepare the overall plan
o f actions with the contributions o f the various departments and donors making
contributions; (ii) coordinate actions to assure mutual support and cross-functional
efficiency; (iii)monitor progress; and (iv) evaluate the intendedresults. This would cover
all project-supported activities including those implemented through the M O E and the
CAO as well as activities financed by other donor partners (for example the Department
for International Development-UK [DFID], supporting the development o f the Budget
Department).

104.    Managers o f the various MOF departments being supported through the project
(and by other donors) would be responsible for achieving their own results within the
MOF annual work plan once they are agreed.

2. Specific Implementation Arrangements for Project Components

105.    Each component and sub-component would follow daily implementation
arrangements specific to the needs of the department being assisted and tasks to be
performed. These responsibilities are summarized in Table 4.1. The RIMU Director
would convene periodic meetings o f these working level authorities to identify and
resolve implementation issues that were outside the scope o ftheir individual authorities.

106.    The Treasury Department, MOE, and CAO would also be ultimately responsible
for the performance o f line ministries in executing their specific areas o f expertise
following the decentralization o f PFM functions. The implementation of the roll-out o f
AFMIS will be done in conjunction with the Budget Department given the coverage of



                                            36

 allotment and contract control now under their responsibility which will be affected by
 the roll-out. However, the RIMU would assist in coordinating the execution of de-
 centralization process from an institutional development perspective. The RIMUwould
 collaborate with the managers o f the departments concerned to assure that critical
 agreements affecting the decentralization process have been or are being resolved
 including: selecting the line ministries to be assisted; setting preconditions to be met by
  line ministries prior to being supported in adopting PFM functions; defining procedures
 and processes for maintaining work flows between MOF and the line ministries and
 quality control; and assuring adequate training and materials for line ministry staff.

 3. Coordination with Donors and with the PAR Strategy

   107.                                 The RIMU would conduct two closely related annual events that would include
 the participation of donors and other stakeholders. The APR would report on the
  achievement o f results and evaluate progress considering the benchmarks set for the
 project and expectations set out in the previous years' annual work program. The APR
 would diagnose issues and lead to recommendations for modifying work programs,
 regulations or implementation arrangements. An annual work programming exercise,
 which would account for the results o f the APR, would also include the participation o f
  donors and account for changes intheir support activities.




                                                                                                                                                                                                                      37

108.    The government i s committed to public administration reform and its strategy has
recently evolved to encompass deep reforms within line ministries, improvements in
institutions o f oversight such as the judiciary and Parliament, and over the longer term,
evolution inthe role o f sub-national institutions o f governance and enhanced civil society
engagement. Reform o f the PFM in the MOF, MOE, CAO and other line ministries and
sub-national bodies i s a critical element o f the overall GOA PAR strategy and program
considering its role in determining civil service pay and responsibilities for determining
the rate at which PFM functions can be transferred to line ministries and agencies. The
MinisterofFinance is a member ofthe PAR SteeringCommittee which oversees the civil
service reform and general PARprogram.

4. ProcurementArrangements

109.    Afghanistan has made considerable efforts to establish the Legal and Regulatory
Framework for procurement in the last five years with the donor support. A new
Procurement Law reflecting the best international practices in public procurement has
been enacted in November 2005 replacing the earlier Procurement Regulations. The
Afghanistan Procurement Regulations and Procedures have been prepared and awaiting
the clearance from the Ministry o f Justice and the Cabinet o f Ministers. A Special
Procurement Commission which will be responsible to review the contract award
recommendations for contracts exceeding US$500,000 will be operational in April 2007.
A Manual of Procedures for Procurement Appeal and Review has been preparedand the
system will beginto be operational by April 2007. Afghanistan-specific bidding/proposal
documents will be prepared by December 2007. Bidding opportunities for all major
contracts and the contract awards are published in the ARDS website under the MOE.
ARDS-PU i s currently issuing the bidding documents to all the potential bidders
electronically free o f charge. The above actions will increase the transparency and the
confidence o f the business community. However, much needs to be done in
dissemination o f the new law/regulations/procedures/appeal mechanism to all the stake
holders o f government and the business community. A technical assistance operation i s in
place to carry out an intensive and extensive capacity building program. Action will be
simultaneously taken to develop procurement proficient personnel with an accreditation
system. In addition GOA would seek opportunities to get the civil society involved to
provide an oversight inthe adherence to transparency inthe process.

110.    Most o f the procurement under the project will be for the provision o f technical
assistance through firmshdividuals which would provide assistance corresponding to
each o f the components and sub-components to MOF/MOE and CAO. ARDS-PU shall
assist all the implementing agencies to carryout procurement o f major consultancies
including high value individual assignments and all goods following International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) and National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures other
than the assignment for selection o f a firm to manage the Procurement Unit. The
implementingagencies will provide technical inputs inpreparation o f terms of reference
and specifications and take the lead in carrying out technical evaluations. The
procurement departments o f each implementing agency will be responsible for the
procurement o f small value goods contracts following Shopping and Direct Contracting



                                             38

procedures. RIMU will take the lead in coordinating activities among all agencies.
Actual tenderingwould be managed by the ARDS. A summary o f procurement methods
i s given inAnnex C.

111.    The Financial Officer of the RIMU would be responsible for contract
administration, and with the user department, shall monitor compliance with terms o f
reference/compliance to the agreed specifications.

5. FinancialManagement, Disbursementand Audit Arrangements

112.    A PFM performance rating system has been recently developed for Afghanistan
by the PEFA multi-agency partnership program which includes the World Bank, IMF,
European Commission, and other agencies. Afghanistan's ratings against the PFM
performance indicators portray a public sector where financial resources are, by and
large, being used for their intended purposes as authorized by a budget that i s processed
withtransparency andhas contributedto aggregate fiscal discipline.

113.    At the project level, financial management will be coordinated by the RIMU of
the MOF. The RIMUwouldreportto the Minister of Finance as hisproject executive arm
and will also serve as the "secretariat" for deliberations o f the PFM Reform Steering
Committee. A Financial Management Specialist will be recruited at RIMU with
responsibility for financial management activities of the project which will include
processing o f consultants and suppliers invoices for payments (Le., preparing M-16 forms
payment orders); maintaining relevant accounting records; preparing required monthly,
quarterly and annual reports; coordinating with other component implementing entities to
ensure that adequate financial management requirements are met; liaising with the
Special Disbursements Unit (SDU) to ensure that the Designated Account (DA) i s
replenishedwhen due; and responding to project audits.

114.    At the implementing entities responsible for the other components, a dedicated
manager and an accounts officer will be assigned by these entities to ensure that they
maintain adequate records andpreparetechnical andfinancial reports oftheir activities.

115.    Quarterly un-audited financial statements will be prepared by the RIMU
accounting unit. Consolidated project reports will be prepared, reviewed, and approved
by the MOF, supported by the FM Advisor. A DA will be opened at Da Afghanistan
Bank (DAB, Central Bank). The DA will be maintained by the MOF. Withdrawal
applications for replenishment will be submitted monthly. Financial management
arrangements for the project are detailed inAnnex D.

116.    Funds Flow. Funds management for the project will follow existing procedures.
As with all public expenditure, all payments under the project will be routed through
MOF. The FMAdvisor will assist the MOF inexecuting and recordingproject payments.
In keeping with current practices for other projects in Afghanistan, the DA will be
operated by the SDU inthe Treasury DepartmentMOF. Requests for payments from DA
funds will be made to the SDU by RIMU. In addition to payments from DA funds,



                                            39

RIMU can also request the SDU to make direct payments to consultants or consulting
firms and special commitments for contracts covered by letters of credit. Such requests
will follow World Bank procedures.        All withdrawal applications to IDA including
replenishment, reimbursement, and direct payment applications will be prepared and
submittedby MOF.


117.     Accounting and Reporting. A Financial Management Manual will be prepared
by RIMU documenting the financial management arrangements for the project. The
manual will outline guidelines for project activities including specific requirements for
each component implementing entity, and establish a project financial management
system in accordance with standard Afghan government policies and procedures. This
will include use o f the Chart o f Accounts developed by the Treasury to record project
expenditure. Project accounts will be consolidated centrally in MOF, through the SDU
and supported by the FM Advisor. Consolidated Project Financial Statements will be
preparedfor all sources and uses of project expenditures.

118.     Disbursement Method. Disbursements from the IDA grant will make use of
reimbursement, direct payment, and payments under Special Commitments including full
documentation or against statements o f expenditures, as appropriate.

119.     Retroactive Financing.      A provision has been made to reimburse the
Government for payments from government resources up to a maximum o f US$2 million
for eligible project expenditures incurredafter April 15, 2007 and up to the signing o f the
Financing Agreement, in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines. In
particular and given its urgency and priority, this provision i s expected to be utilized to
facilitate the early mobilization of the consultants on systems development and for the
RIMU.

120.     Audit of Project Funds. The Auditor General, supportedby the Audit Agent, is
responsible for auditing the accounts of all IDA-financed projects.        Annual audited
project financial statements will be submitted within six months o f the close of GOA'S
fiscal year. The project audit o f 1384 reported ineligible expenditures which are still
pendingresolution.


            v. ACTION PLAN,MONITORINGEVALUATION RESULTS
                                             AND                  AND

A. Action Plan

121.     The M O F has agreed to establish the RIMU as the vehicle for advising MOF
management on its action plan for improving overall PFM performance. Staffing of the
RIMU has begunwith the appointment o f the Director. The remaining national staff of
the RIMU were due to be appointed before project negotiations. The services of
international advisors for the RIMU have begun in that terms o f reference and
qualifications for two key positions have been agreed. Securing these services will be
arrangedwith the IARCSC under conditions governingthe CSR project. The project will


                                           40

be implemented through annual work plans; the plan for the first year will be prepared
before the project begins.

B. Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements

122.    The RIMUwould incorporate the current M&EUinto its structure for the life of
the PFMR project to assure coherent results-focused project management. The M&EU
now reports to the Deputy Minister o f Administration and this arrangement would be re-
instated at the end o f the project.

123.    The M&EU which is staffed by a senior Afghan national consultant has
conducted one full year monitoring the reform activities assigned to each of the MOF's
operating departments contained in the MOF Strategic Plan. It has reported findings
quarterly to the Deputy Minister o f Administration and senior MOF officials. However,
the Strategic Plan focused mainly on shorter term actions that would correct immediate
operational deficiencies in the MOF's work. As a result, the M&EU has not had
experience in monitoring "results" and evaluating longer term outcomes. It has not
therefore been ina position to recommend re-programming reform activities contained in
that Strategic Plan.

124.    With the M&EUstaff, the RIMUwould introduce a newmonitoring methodology
including monitoring the achievement o f annual benchmark results as presented inAnnex
A, in addition to the more conventional monitoring o f the execution o f activities that are
agreed inannual work programs.


          0     Quarterly Activity Reports.      RIMU/M&EU would continue current
                practices in compiling quarterly activity and input use reports that would
                also evaluate progress in meeting expected annual results. The audience
                for these reports would be the RIMUand the PFMR Steering Committee.
                They would be used essentially for short term management and
                coordination purposes. They would draw on observations by the M&EU
                and activity reports by those responsible for implementation of various
                components and sub-components (as i s the current practice), as well as
                expenditure and personnel use data. They would estimate the likelihood o f
                meeting annual results expectations based on these observations. The mid-
                year report would be compiled so as to coincide with a regular supervision
                mission o f IDA and other donors.


          0     Annual Performance Report. During the last quarter o f each project year,
                intime to influence the preparation ofthe following year's work program,
                the RIMUwould contract with independent short term consultants to make
                a more thorough review o f project performance. Their report would be
                "strategic"   in nature and tone, compiling the updated information
                previously presented in quarterly activities reports, but focusing on
                evaluating progress in meeting results benchmarks (for individual
                components and sub-components) and the project's strategic objectives. It



                                            41

                would make recommendations concerning modification o f activities, and
                inan extreme case, modificationof expected results. The audience for this
                report would be the RIMU, the Minister, Deputy Ministers/Treasury, the
                Project Steering Committee, and donors.

                Annual Performance Review (APR). Based on the consultant's report, the
                Minister and the RIMU would convene an APR whose objectives would
                be to: (i)validate the factual findings and agree with or modify their
                interpretation; and (ii) discuss and agree on modifications to the reform
                program activities. This would assure that strategic results were going to
                be achieved and the follow-on annual work program (activities, costs,
                financing, implementation arrangements) would incorporate these actions.
                In the second APR, if exogenous events appeared to make original
                assumptions underlying the project unrealistic, the development objectives
                o f the project may also be modified. The APR would be timedto meet the
                GOA budget cycle. Donors would be expected to time their project
                supervision activities to participate inthe APR.

125.    After approximately 24 months o f project implementation, the RIMU would
conduct a strategic review o f progress in meeting overall PFMR results (Annex A). As a
key part o f this review, it would engage short term consultants to assist in updating the
findings o f the "PEFA Analysis" contained in the 2005 publication "Afghanistan:
Managing Public Finances for Development." The purpose o f this review would be to
identify the framework for the preparation of a further 2-3 years of reform in the PFM
system which might be supported by donors. The audience for this review would be the
political level o f the GOA, donors, and stakeholders. Donors would participate in this
review treating it as an "identification" exercise for their further possible support for
PFM reform.

C. Bank Supervision

126.    Bankmonitoring and evaluationwill bebased on a set o f specific and monitorable
performance monitoring indicators from the results framework presented in Annex A.
Specific benchmarks have been outlined for agreement between the government and
technical assistance providers early on in implementation so as to measure specific
progress in meeting both the PFM performance and capacity building objectives. The
project's task team leader will be located in Kabul and conduct continuous supervision.
Additionally, a full supervision mission will be carried out twice a year comprising
appropriate specialists from each o f the component areas. This supervision will be
conducted incoordination with the supervision o f DFID's technical assistance on Budget
Formulation and Execution. Before the end o f the second year o f project implementation,
a mid-term review will be conducted in order to assess the advance toward the
development objectives. The RIMUwill have the primary responsibility to prepare and
furnish to IDA quarterly project report highlightingprogress in undertaking the actions
required to achieve project development objectives.

                       ANNEXC. PROCUREMENTARRANGEMENTS

A. Country Context

1.       The Bankhas gained substantial experience andunderstanding o fthe procurement
environment in Afghanistan through its involvement in the interim procurement
arrangements put in place through EPAP as well as with the institutions such as ARDS
that i s holding the current responsibility for government's procurement administration.
As part of the broader review of Afghanistan's PFM system, the Bank recently carried
out an assessment o f the procurement environment in the country based on the baseline
and performance indicators developed by a group o f institutions led by the World Bank
and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development/Development Assistance
Committee.

2.       The first key issue identified through the procurement assessment was the need
for ownership and a champion in the government for reform, deepening o f capacity,
ensuring integrity in the operation o f procurement systems, and promoting sound
procurement among ministries.

3.       A new Procurement Law was adopted in November 2005 which radically
transforms the legal and regulatory framework for the procurement administration o f
Afghanistan. While it provides a very modern legal system for procurement, effective
implementation o f the law may encounter difficulties in the current weak institutional
structure and capacity o f the government. A PPU has now been established under MOF
to ensure the implementation through the creation o f secondary legislation, standard
bidding documents, provision of advice and creation of the necessary information
systems for advertising and data collection. "Afghanistan Procurement Regulations" has
been prepared under two sections: (i)    Regulations; and (ii)
                                                             Procedures and under review
by the Ministry o f Justice prior to submission to the Cabinet o f Ministers. Procedures for
procurement appeal and review have been developed by PPU/MOF and the nominated
memberswill be appointed for the system to be functional by April 2007.

4.       Inthe absence o f adequate capacity to manage procurement activities effectively,
some interim arrangements have been put in place to improve the procurement
management o f the country. A central procurement facilitation service, ARDS-PU has
been established under the supervision o f MOE. The Bank and the government have
agreed on a program for country-wide procurement reform and capacity buildingleading
to the transition from centralized to decentralized procurement services.        The Bank
funded PACB project is the primary instrument for implementing the program to
strengthencapacity o f the line ministries to manage public procurement in an effective,
transparent and accountable manner. However, the implementation o f the procurement
capacity building strategy has not made any significant progress yet due to lack o f
coordination and delays in decision making within the government.            The envisaged
radical changes to the procurement management environment expected from the new

capacity development program.        The implementation o f the procurement reform
component o f the PACB and the proposed PFMR project should be considered with due
priority to ensure that fiduciary standards are further enhanced and that capacity i s
developed inthe government to maintainthese standards.

PartA General
         -

5.       The procurement administration of the project would be carried out inaccordance
with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits"
dated May 2004, "Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers" dated May 2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Financing Agreement.
The general description o f various procurements under different expenditure categories
are described below. For each contract to be financed by the Grant the different
procurement methods or consultant selection methods, estimated costs, prior review
requirements, and time frame agreed between the Grant Recipient and the Bank project
team are described in the Procurement Plan. This Procurement Plan will be updated at
least annually or more frequently as required to reflect the actual project implementation
needs and improvements inthe institutional capacity.

6.       Procurement of Works. The proposed grant will not finance any works
contracts.

7.       Procurement of Goods. Goods procured under this project would include office
furniture and equipment, IT equipment and software, multi media equipment, office
equipment and computers for MOF/CAO. The procurement o f goods will be done using
Bank's SBDs for all ICB and Afghanistan-specific SBD agreed with the Bank for all
NCB. Other procurement method will be shopping. All goods contracts estimated to cost
more than US$200,000 shall be procured following ICB procedures. The contracts
estimated to cost more than US$lOO,OOO and less than US$200,000 shall be procured
following N C B procedures and contracts estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO shall be
procured following shopping procedures. With the prior agreement with IDA, direct
contracting method may be used to procure proprietary software including upgrades for
existing software and other goods and services which meet the requirements as per the
provision under paragraph 3.6 o f Bank's Guidelines.

8.       Selectionof Consultants.There will be a several highvalue technical assistance
(TA) contracts under the project. These TAs will include the hiring o f consulting firms
for: (i)Procurement Capacity Building and Legal and Institutional Reform; (ii)   Treasury
systems development and roll-out; (iii)Internal Audit Work Practices; (iv) HR
development in Financial Management; (v) HR development in Audit practices; (vi)
Management o f Reform implementation o f the MOF; (vii) Central Procurement
facilitation; (viii) CAO support inaudit operations; and (ix) Treasury Operations support.
The consultant for Procurement Capacity Building and Legal and Institutional Reform
has commenced the assignment. This assignment will be partly financed by the ongoing
PACB I1project.




                                           48

9.      In addition there will be high value assignments for individual consultants to
provide: (i)advisory inputs to PPU; (ii)     to support Internal Audit Reviews and Fraud
Review; and (iii) external audit - Parliamentary oversight.

10.     Some o f the above assignments have already commenced under the on-going
PACB project and extensions to the ongoing contracts as needed may be provided based
on the performance o f the consultants in the on-going assignment following Single
Source Selection (SSS) procedures.

11.     The selection o f consultants under the project will include Quality and Cost Based
Selection (QCBS), Quality Based Selection (QBS), Consultants' Qualifications Selection
(CQS), Least Cost Selection (LCS), Fixed Budget Selection (FBS), SSS and individual
consultants in accordance with Section V o f the Bank's guidelines for the selection o f
consultants. Threshold for CQS procedure will be US$200,000 per contract.

12.     Short lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than $100,000
equivalent per contract may be composed entirely o f national consultants in accordance
with the provisions o fparagraph 2.7 ofthe consultant guidelines.

13.     Incremental Operational Costs which would be financed by the project would
be procured using the implementing agency's administrative procedures which were
reviewed and found acceptable to the Bank.

Part B Assessment of the Agency's Capacityto ImplementProcurement
        -

14.     The project will be implemented by MOF. An assessment o f the capacity of the
MOF to implementthe procurement actions under the project was carried out inFebruary
2007 by Deepal Fernando (Senior Procurement Specialist) and Rahimullah Wardak
(Procurement Analyst) o f the Afghanistan country office.

15.     The assessment reviewed the organizational structure for the implementation of
the project andthe capacity o fthe implementingagenciesto handle procurement.

Ministryof Finance

16.    Director General (Administration) o f the MOF i s handlingday-to-day small value
procurement for the ministry. Therefore, that unit has the capacity to carry out small
value contracts following shopping and direct contracting procedures with limited
capacity building. This unit has not handled and does not have the capacity to handle
large value contracts including selection o f consultants.

Controland Audit Office

17.    The Department of Services reporting to Director General (Finance and
Administration) i s responsible for all the procurement actions o f the CAO. CAO's office
does not carry out major procurement activities. Inthe recent past they have purchased a



                                              49

few computers and furniture under the development and ordinary budget. They have one
procurement officer. We can agree to allow the CAO office to procure goods following
shopping and direct contracting procedures.

Ministry of Economy

18.     The Procurement Unit o f the MOE is handling day-to-day small value
procurement for the ministry. Therefore that unit will have the capacity to carryout small
value contracts following shopping procedures with limited capacity building. This unit
has not handledand does not have the capacity to handle large value contracts including
selection o f consultants.

19.     The ARDS-PU o f the M O E already has sufficient capacity and experience in
handlingprocurement. At present, PUprovides procurement services to all the ministries
under the GOA for all projects funded by the government and donors. There was a
circular o f MOF which indicates that ARDS-PU should carry out all the procurement
actions for contracts estimated to cost more than US$200,000. This requirement may be
waived provided the implementing ministry/agency i s sufficiently equipped with staff or
procurement consultants capable of carrying out procurement actions. The staff o f
ARDS-PU is familiar with procurement procedures and guidelines o f the GOA, World
Bank and other donors. ARDS has a register o f firms and consultants. All the bid
invitations and Expressions o f Interest are advertised intheir website and the documents
are issued electronically free o f charge to the registered bidders and the others who wish
to participate in the biddingprocess. All the awards as per the Law are published in the
ARDS website on behalfof all the ministrieswho seek their services.

20.     Based on the above assessment, it was agreed that all goods contracts following
I C B N C B procedures and all consulting assignments with firms and high value
assignments o f selection o f individual consultants on behalf o f the M O F will be carried
out by the ARDS-PU under the MOE. The assignment for the selection of a consultant
for central procurement facilitation will behandledby the administration unit o f the MOF
with guidance from MOE and PPU of MOF, as it will be a conflict to allow the current
ARDS-PU to take a lead inthe procurement process.

21,     However in order to mitigate procurement risks, it i s proposed to conduct several
training programs as indicated below for the staff o f the MOF, CAO, and MOE especially
drawn from the administration unit and potential evaluation committee members. In
addition, it i s important that the consultant selected to carryout the capacity building
activities carry out several programs to create awareness among all the stakeholders o f
the new Procurement Law and Afghanistan Procurement Regulations and Procedures.
The proposed capacity buildingprogram is presented insection D1.

The procurement risk at the country levelis consideredas "Average."

Part C ProcurementPlan
       -

22.    The Grant recipient, at appraisal, developed a procurement plan for project
implementation which provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has
been agreed between the Grant recipient and the project team and is available at MOF,
Pashtunistan Wat, Kabul, Afghanistan. It will also be available in the project's database
and on the Bank's external website. The procurement plan will be updated inagreement
with the project team annually or as requiredto reflect the actual project implementation
needs and improvements ininstitutional capacity.

PartD Frequencyof ProcurementSupervision
       -
23.    Inaddition to the prior reviewsupervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the
capacity assessment o f the Implementing Agency has recommended two procurement
reviewsper year.

                           ANNEXD. FINANCIALMANAGEMENT
I.CountryIssues

1.      The Bank has gained substantial experience and understanding o f the financial
management environment in Afghanistan through the large number o f projects under
implementation over the past four years. The PACB project i s the primary instrument to
continue and enhance the fiduciary measures put in place during the past years to help
ensure transparency and accountability for the funding provided by the Bank and other
donors.

2.      A PFM performance rating system using 28 high-level indicators that was
developed by the PEFA multi-agency partnership program was applied in Afghanistan in
June 2005. PEFA i s comprised o f the World Bank, IMF, European Commission, and
several other agencies. The system i s structured around six core dimensions o f PFM
performance: (i)  budget credibility; (ii)
                                        comprehensiveness and transparency; (iii)  policy-
based budgeting; (iv) predictability and control in budget execution; (v) accounting,
recording, and reporting; and (vi) external scrutiny and audit.      Afghanistan's ratings
against the PFM performance indicators generally portray a public sector where financial
resources are, by and large, being used for their intended purposes. This has been
accomplished with very high levels o f support from international firms; this assistance
will continue to be needed over the medium term if these ratings are to be maintained.
There i s also much room for improvement.

3.      In spite of undeniable gains made in reconstruction since the end of 2001, the
challenges facing Afghanistan remain immense, not least because of the tenuous security
situation in the region and continued prevalence o f a large illegal and illicit economy.
The policy framework benchmarks have not yet beenfully costed so various priorities are
funded through the annual budgeting process. The rising costs o f the security sector
constitute the major constraint on attainment o f fiscal sustainability. With regard to
executive oversight, the national assembly will play an increasingly active role. All in
all, the new national strategy has created high expectations o f the executive which could
prove to be quite difficult to meet.

4.      The public sector, in spite o f considerable efforts to reform its core functions,
remains extremely weak outside o f Kabul. The lack o f qualified staff inthe civil service
and the absence o f qualified counterparts in the government after 30 years o f war and
conflicts i s a binding constraint. Delays in reforming the pay structure and grading o f
civil servants have severely crippled the public administration o f the country. Domestic
revenues lag behind expenditures by a factor o f ten to one. Large-scale corruption could
emerge to undermine the government's efforts to enhance aid flows through national
accounts.    Capacities to track expenditures and monitor expenditure outcomes have
improved but they need rapid and substantial strengthening if progress toward the
attainment o f national development targets i s to be monitored. Currently 75% o f external
revenues bypass government appropriation systems.




                                            57

5.       The World Bank is financing a Financial Management Advisor to assist the MOF,
an Audit Advisor to assist the CAO, and a Procurement Advisor to assist inprocurement-
related activities. Also an Internal Audit function i s being developed within the MOF
with World Bank financing. USAID, and earlier the Indian Aid Assistance Program, is
financing a team o f consultants and advisors to assist the DAB inlocal as well as foreign
currency operations. The activities carried out under the existing public administration
projects have helped the government to ensure that appropriate fiduciary standards are
maintained for public expenditures, including those supported by the Bank and the donor
community.

6.       Progress has been slower than expected in shifting from operations support
provided by the three advisors to capacity development and knowledge transfer to the
civil servants. Given that, it i s expected that the advisors will continue to be required for
the medium term.       Challenges still remain in attaining the agreed upon fiduciary
standards and also to further enhance them. And to make matters more complex, the
regulatory environment inAfghanistan has advanced significantly inthe past three years.
Unfortunately, even mastery o f basic skills in the early environment does not fully
qualify the civil servants to work effectively inthe new emerging environment.

 111. Strengthsand Weaknesses

 Strengths

 8.      The government provides assurance to the Bank and other donors that the
 measures in place to ensure appropriate utilization o f funds will not be circumvented.
 The government support for PACB is strength in itself to enhance financial management
 in Treasury operations, public procurement, internal audit in the public sector, and
 external audit by the Auditor General. A specific strength i s that this i s a follow-up
 project, and thus, the agencies involved in the implementation o f each component have
 experience inimplementing Bank projects and following Bank procedures.

 Weaknesses and Action Plan

 9.      The main weakness inthis project, as inmany others inAfghanistan, is the ability
 to attract suitably qualified and experienced counterpart staff especially for financial
 management. The additional staff to be funded by the project, together with intensive
 training programs included in this project, i s expected to strengthen the fiduciary
 arrangements.

 be defined

 V. ImplementingEntity

 10.     The project would be implemented under the authority o f the Minister o f Finance.
 The Minister would be assisted by the PFM Reform Steering Committee (PFMRSC)
 comprising senior M O F departmental managers, a representative o f the MOE responsible
 for procurement administration, and a representative o f the CAO to maintain focus on
 results, good communications and a consolidated view o f the reform and to discuss and
 recommend any necessary policy and regulatory improvements.

 11.     The PFMRSC will serve as the oversight body for the project. The committee will
 convene at least every quarter to review progress with implementation and review and
 approve work plans and budget.

 12.     Daily operations o fthe project would be managed by a newly formed RIMU. The
 RIMUwould report to the Minister of Finance on project implementation and will also


                                             60

serve as the "secretariat" for deliberations o f the PFMRSC. The specific role o f the
RIMU would be to plan, coordinate, monitor and evaluate the implementation of the
overall PFM reform strategy work program and the achievement o f its intended results.
This would cover all project-supported activities including those implemented through
the MOE and the CAO as well as activities financed by other donor partners (for
example, DFID, supporting the development o f the Budget Department). The RIMU
would also undertake analyses and recommendations o f key policy issues affecting the
efficient performance and sustainability o f PFM reforms. It would be responsible for
planning for and facilitating and obtaining the contributions o f the IARCSC to
developing the M O F human resources management capabilities so that they are
consistent with overall civil service management regulations and best practices. Lastly,
the RIMUwould facilitate establishing and maintaining linkages with line ministries and
Mustofiats that would be the "clients" instrengthening PFM institutions.

13.    Managers o f the PPU, Treasury, Internal Audit, MOE, and CAO being supported
through the project (and by other donors) would be responsible for achieving their own
specifically assigned results, once they had agreed with annual work plans and
established implicit performance agreements through the PFMRSC. The RIMU would
monitor these performance agreements.

14.    The Financial Management Specialist to be recruited at RIMU will take
responsibility for financial management activities o f the project, which will include
processing o f consultants and suppliers invoices for payments (Le., preparing M-16 forms
payment orders); maintaining relevant accounting records; preparing required monthly,
quarterly and annual reports; coordinating with other component implementing entities to
ensure that adequate financial management requirements are met; liaising with the SDU
to ensure that the Designated Account i s replenished when due; and respondingto project
audits.

15.    To ensure that the implementing entities responsible for the other components
maintain adequate records and preparetechnical and financial reports o f their activities, a
dedicated manager and an accounts officer will be assigned by the M O E and CAO.

VI. Budgeting

16.    RIMU will coordinate with each component implementing entity for the
preparation o f annual work plan and the derivation o f annual budget. This would then be
submitted to the PFMRSC for approval. RIMU shall also coordinate quarterly budget
reviews to ensure adequate budget discipline and control. It will be responsible for
ensuring that project expenditures for each fiscal year are captured in the governmental
development budget o f that fiscal year. The RIMU must get approvals from the
presidential office and the Parliament and attach them to B27 and Project Coding Sheet
forms at the time o f requesting yearly allotments for contracts under the project to avoid
delays inpayment processing.

 VII. FundsFlow

 17.     The standard funds flow mechanism in Afghanistan will be followed in this
 project. Project funds will be deposited in the Designated Account to be opened and
 maintained at the DAB. The Designated Account, in keeping with current practices for
 other projects inAfghanistan, will be operated by the SDU inthe Treasury Department o f
 the MOF. Requests for payments from the Designated Account will be made to the SDU
 bythe implementingentity when needed.

 request the SDU to make: (i)    direct payments from the Grant account to consultants or
 consulting firms; and (ii) special commitments for contracts covered by letters o f credit.
 These payments will follow World Bank procedures. All project payments will be made
 to either international firms or local firms that have bank accounts in DAB, a local
 commercial bank, or an overseas bank. All payments will be made either through bank
 transfers into the account of such firms or by check. Expenditures for each component
 will be paid centrally from RIMU in accordance with the approval mechanisms
 documented inthe project FMManual.

 VII. Retroactive Financing

 19.     A provision has been made to reimbursethe government for payments it makes
 from government resources up to a maximum o f SDR 1.3 million (US$2 million) for
 eligible project expenditures incurred after April 15, 2007 and up to the signing o f the
 Financing Agreement in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines.                  In

Component 1.2 Treasury Systems Development and Roll-out
                 -

Background

1.       The Islamic Republic o f Afghanistan has begun a program o f government
financial management improvements            which i s   expected to have far-reaching
consequences for the manner and processes o f financial transactions, recording,
accounting, and reporting over the next several years. The extent o f these reforms i s
evolving but includes budget and expenditure reforms and improved accounting,
financial reporting, and internal controls.

2.       Over the past four years, an integrated financial management system has been
implemented in the Treasury o f the MOF. The basic objective o f this system was to
ensure accountability over the government's budget and expenditures including donor
funds. It was not intended to be a complete integrated management information system
that would be capable o f serving the needs o f all government managers. It was basically
a Treasury system. FreeBalance software i s the core application o f the system known as
the AFMIS.

3.       As the government has moved forward with their reform program, it became
apparent that AFMIS needed to be enhanced to meet the increased needs o f the Treasury
staff as well as line ministries and Mustofiats.        Therefore, in this component, the
consultant will need to acquire the following modules from FreeBalance in order to
complete the expanded financial management functions in AFMIS - Procurement, Fixed
Assets, and Accounts Receivable. The vendor for the Budget Preparation module will be
decided subsequently.

4.       A fully automated off-the-shelf HRMIS for implementation in MOF is also
considered necessary. At present, MOF uses the Microsoft Access-based payroll system
known as Verified Payroll Program which includes the Computerized Payroll System.
Nevertheless, there i s no HR functionality in the system and the support and
documentation o f in-house systems i s not optimal. The ultimate goal for HRMIS i s to
direct deposit the net pay o f each employee into his or her bank account and provide the
critical personnel data for eventual centralization and determination o fpension liabilities.

5.      AFMIS will be the core financial management information system o f the GOA.
The information contained in AFMIS will provide MOF a foundation for a
comprehensive management information view related to the country's financial
resources. Inaddition, AFMIS will provide useful financial information to line ministries
to enable them to better manage their programs. It will give these ministries the facilities
to download relevant and authorized data and perform required analyses.




                                             68

6.      To conduct their designated business affairs, line ministries will require the ability
to enter transactions into AFMIS and to approve such transactions through the Financial
Controllers (a Treasury staff) located within the line ministries. One objective o f the
AFMIS roll out i s to have transaction processing andpayment authorization decentralized
butpayment processing to remain centrally within Treasury and the Mustofiats. This will
streamline transaction processing and enable Treasury staff to be reassigned from data
entry to other key Treasury functions. For the purpose o f this Component, the consultant
will assist the government inrolling out AFMIS to six line ministries and six Mustofiats.
In addition to rolling out AFMIS to six line ministries, the consultant will assist the
government in rolling out just the report module o f AFMIS to six additional line
ministries.

Objectives

7.      The objective o f this contract is for the contractor to assist the government in
rolling out AFMIS to the six line ministries and six Mustofiats. This roll-out will occur
after the contractor installs additional modules (Procurement, Fixed Assets and Account
Receivable, Budget Preparation, and HR) purchased from FreeBalance or from other
vendors especially for HR and Budget Preparation. In addition, the contractor will roll-
out just the Reporting Module to six additional line ministries in order to facilitate
management reporting capabilities and develop the program interfaces for HR and
Budget modules ifsourced from a vendor other than FreeBalance.

Scope of Services

8.      This consultancy has several distinct but related components:

    e   Roll out the enhanced AFMIS to Treasury.
    e   Roll out the enhanced AFMIS to the six line ministries and six Mustofiats in a
        phased approach. Roll out to line ministries i s dependent on having qualified
        Financial Controllers inplace at the line ministries.
    e   Enhance the management reporting capability in AFMIS to meet management
        needs from the system.
    e   The consultant will needto develop a roll-out plan and schedule for the system for
        all designated sites. Inaddition, a plan also needs to be developed for rolling out
        the Reporting Module to the six additional line ministries.
    e   A checklist needs to be developed detailing tasks that need to be undertaken for
        roll out o f the system to a typical line ministry and Mustofiat.
    e   Assist the Treasury in determiningHR functionality to be activated from the new
        module, train payroll units inthe use and develop the interface with AFMIS.
    e   The consultant will take the lead inaddressing change management issues within
        Treasury and the respective ministriesand Mustofiats.
    e   The consultant shall, in conjunction with MOF personnel, develop and negotiate
        with line ministries and Mustofiats, appropriate Service Level Agreements for the
        effective and efficient operation o f AFMIS. These draft agreements shall be
        developed and signed by the M O F and individual line ministries and Mustofiats

        Mustofiats.

Component1.4.1 ExternalAudit Advisory Services
                    -
Background

9.      The CAO i s inthe process o f reforming its organization, methods, and operations.
Major training efforts are in process to improve the skills o f the audit staff. EPAP and
PACB assistance has used a professional accounting firm to provide guidance to the
CAO inthese matters and there is a need for a senior advisor to the Auditor General on a
full-time basis to manage the processes o f continuing improvement that are needed for
the CAO to reach a level of performance that no longer needs the routine direct support
operations o f the contracted firm. A new Audit Law i s inpreparation and the advisor will
be needed to assist with its implementation.

10.     An advisor has been in place for one year under PACB and has been a valuable
source o f assistance, supported by the program o f technical assistance included in the
terms of reference for the supporting audit firm providing direct audit support. The
PFMR project will concentrate the work o f the audit firm on deliveringaudit services and
support the strengthening o f the CAO by continuing the provision o f an advisor
supported by three audit experts available on a full-time basis to work as audit team
leaders and provide on-the-job training to the CAO and its staff.          This will greatly
improve the quality o f the audit work, embed the new audit manuals provided, and build
a competent audit workforce conducting audits that are relevant to the role o f the CAO as
set out inthe PEFM Law and the draft Audit Law.

11.     Some particular Articles o f the PEFM Law will be directly addressed by the
advisory services. The advisory services will support Articles 5 and 6 which impose
obligations on relevant persons for the conduct o f financial affairs by training the auditors
to assess internal controls and the implementation o f these obligations, and thereby
support the system o f accountability established by the Law. Article 55 requires a final
budget reconciliations report and a set of financial statements prepared in accordance
with International Public Sector Accounting Standards. Revenues, expenditures, assets,
and liabilities will be reported and audited by the CAO as per Article 59 which requires
audit certification and public report to the National Assembly within six months o f the
end o fthe year. The auditing services will enable these certifications and reports to be in
accordance with InternationalAuditing Standards.

Contractor Terms of Reference

12.     The specific function o f these advisor services are to coordinate the training and
capacity building inthe CAO, and ensure that quality control arrangements are instituted
inthe CAO so that audits are conducted to international standards.


Objectives
13.     The goals o f the GOA include maintaining appropriate fiduciary standards to
provide reasonable assurance to the Afghan public and to international donors that
government resources and donor funds are subject to appropriate allocation and
expenditure controls. An important objective i s achieving compliance with international
standards o f financial management including the use o f internationally recognized
accounting, auditing, and reporting standards enabled by modern technology and
software applications.

14.     This contract seeks to consolidate and enhance the capacity o f the CAO to

Component4.3 DirectOperationsSupportExternalAudit
                 -

Background

38.     Since August 2002, an audit consultancy firm, funded out of EPAP (PKF
International) and then PACB (Deloitte), has been providing operational support and
capacity building assistance to the CAO. The scarcity o f qualified accountants and the


                                            76

lack o f understanding o f financial statement audits within the CAO have required that the
firm play a significant role in the conduct of audits. During this period, the CAO has
completed, with the assistance o f the firm, the audit o f a substantial number o f World
Bank and ARTF funded projects, and the capacity o f the CAO staff has improved under
the on-the-job training supplied by the firm during the audits. These steps have been
successful in re-establishing the CAO as a working institution capable o f absorbing
institutional strengthening assistance, but it has not developed the institution and its staff
sufficiently for them to conduct financial statement audits to international standards
without continuing professionalassistance.

39.     The firm also prepared draft human resources assessment covering training needs,
training strategy, HR management, and a staff qualifications inventory. A range o f formal
training activities including training in English, computer literacy, and basic accounting,
and informal on-the-job training through the conduct o f audits have been conducted with
more than 100 CAO staff taking part. Inaddition, an audit law has been drafted as well as
a draft strategic plan prepared for the CAO with an audit manual yet to be completed.
Mid-term reviews o f progress on these issues indicated a need for more direct, full-time
concentration on implementation and further progression o f these activities inthis project
i s to be undertaken by an audit advisor and some audit experts recruited full-time to
support the CAO under the Advisory Services sub-component o f this project. This will
enable the audit firm to concentrate on the audit and on-the-job training work.

40.      The goals o f the government include maintaining appropriate fiduciary standards
to provide reasonable assurance to the Afghan public and to international donors that
government resources and donor funds are subject to appropriate allocation and
expenditure controls. An important objective i s achieving compliance with international
standards o f financial management including the use o f the International Standards o f
Auditing. The firm has largely been excluded in practice from assisting the CAO with
auditing the government's financial statements. The passage o f the PEFM Law
necessitates that the CAO make greater use o f the firm in these audits during the period
o f the PFMR project as well as for the ARTF and the Grant audits to conduct them in
accordance with international standards.

Contractor Terms of Reference

41.      The specific purpose o f this consultancy i s providing the direct operations support
to the CAO inconducting all o f its certification audits.

Support to Audit Operations

42.      Assistance to be provided under this consultancy for audit operations will focus
on direct, technical audit support and informal on-the-job training to the CAO teams
undertaking audits o f the SY1386, 1387, and 1388 financial statements for the ARTF, the
government's annual accounts, and selected World Bank projects. Additionally, the
project will provide assistance for the audit o f the UNDP Nationally Executed
Expenditure (NEX) projects. As a guideline, approximately 30 World Bank project audits



                                              77

are expected to be undertaken for each solar year. It i s estimated that about 20 person
months of experienced and qualified consultancy services will be required to provide
support and on-the-job training during the annual audit season to about 240 person
months o f CAO audit staff.

43.     The on-the-job training provided during actual audit o f accounts is regarded as a
key part o f the capacity building being provided to CAO staff through knowledge
transfer. The training during the period i s to become more formalized with the intention
o f accrediting CAO staff with competencies inthe various elements of audit work as laid
out inthe International Federationo f Accountants Competency Standards for Auditors.

44.     Additionally, the government i s looking in this round o f contracts to contribute to
buildthe skills for the Afghanistanpublic sector by two means: (i)   on-the-job training for
civil servants who will be acquiring basic knowledge under the HR development
component o f this project with the direct operations consultant firms, and (ii)includingin
the technical assistance teams underthe direct operations support contracts a larger share
o f local advisors with concrete deliverables for the transfer o f knowledge and skills for
the operation of the PFM systems. The contractor will put more emphasis than in the
past on using local advisors and transferring a requisite minimum level o f skills to these
to conduct independently audit field work.

outputs

45.     The principal project-assisted outputs deriving from the direct audit technical
assistance are:
        0   Audited SY1386, 87, and 88 financial statements for the ARTF and the State
            Budget Reconciliation, and State Financial Statements;

        0   Audited SY1386, 87, and 88 financial statements for World Bank projects;
            and

        0   Audited2007, 2008, and 2009 financial statements for UNDP NEXprojects.


46.     Capacity building outputs will be accredited work experience statements for all
CAO staff participating inthe on-the-job work experience program afforded by the above
audits ineight competency skills.

47.     Capacity building will enable CAO to perform the majority o f audits of
government loans and grants to international standards within the period o f the contract
with agreedmilestones.
