                         Implementation Progress has improved, with a disbursement ratio of over 40 percent this fiscal year. Over 90 percent of deliverables for participating towns, as well activities under
                         the energy efficiency component, have been completed. Civil works under the Rural component are well underway and all bidding procedures are fully completed. The credit amount
                         is almost fully committed. Cumulative disbursement is at 74 percent as of May 15, 2013.

                         Per the request of the Government of Moldova the Closing Date has been extended by six (6) months from June 30, 2013 to December 30, 2013. The key reasons are as follows. In
                         Late 2012 water quality tests conducted in all participating villages revealed that in four villages (Valeni, Colibasi, Sarata Noua, and Bestemac) ground water quality does not comply
                         with the national drinking water standards. The National Center for Public Health has been hired to propose technical solutions to improve the quality of supplied water. Currently,

                         detailed designs for the agreed corrective measures are being prepared; the needed equipment and civil works will be financed under the Project. However, these activities could not
                         be completed before the initial Closing Date on June 30, 2013. The Closing Date extension was also required to ensure (i) finalization of water system rehabilitation in the village of
                         Dubasarii Vechi; and (iii) for delivery of the Water Geographic Information System for water sector institutions.

                         With the extension, the likelihood of achieving the Project Development Objectives is high.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Completion of all activities by the new Closing Date in December 30, 2013 will require a pro-active approach by the Moldovan counterparts and the PIU to comply with each
                         implementation milestone. Regular and timely communication to the Bank on the Project developments is critical. It was agreed that during this period the Project Implementation Unit
                         will regularly update the Bank team through regular monthly video-conferences. The Bank continues intensive implementation monitoring, with the last mission conducted in mid-
                         April, and next one planned for early June, 2013.

                         A public awareness campaign, financed under the Project, has been conducted in four villages where ground water quality does not comply with national drinking water standards. It
                         is critical that the Ministry of Environment and the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) continue close follow-up to the public awareness campaign in all four villages until all works are
                         completed.
