                         The restructuring of the Project was approved by the Bank's Board of Directors on August 2012. The amendment to the Financing Agreement was signed by the Bank and co-signed
                         by the Government in September 2012. The amendments include agreed modifications to the Project Development Objective, scope of the Project components (rural component,

                         Project implementation is in a critical phase. To date 62% of the loan amount has been disbursed and commitments have reached 81% of the total loan amount. Eight works
                         contracts have been completed (Balti, Cahul, Causeni, Ungheni and Floresti under Project’s Part 1 - Water Supply and Wastewater Services in Selected Water Utility Entities, and
                         Bestemac, Pirita and Valeni under Part 2 - Water Supply Services in Selected Rural Communities?) and seven others are ongoing (Causeni, Orhei and Ungheni under Part 1, and

                         Sarata Noua, Valeni, Bestemac and Colibasi under Part 2). Nine works contracts are under implementation under Part 1, Part 2 and Part 4 (Energy Efficiency Component) of the
                         Project. Four civil works contracts are at the evaluation stage. The implementation schedule remains critical for the Project's Part 2 (Rural water supply component) under which few
                         contracts are yet to be signed.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Several agreed urgent actions that are critical for achieving the Project Development Objectives (PDO) are outstanding since the previous monitoring mission in April 2012.
                         Project success and completion by the closing date in June 2013 will require a pro-active approach by the Moldovan counterparts and the PIU to comply with each implementation
                         milestone. Failure to comply with the agreed milestones or the need for further re-biddings would jeopardize timely completion of works that could lead to potential cancellation of the
                         loan proceeds. Regular and timely communication to the Bank on the Project developments is critical. It was agreed that during this period the Project Implementation Unit will
                         regularly update the Bank team through weekly progress updates and regular monthly video-conferences.

                         The issue of the PIU capacity and staffing remains critical. Currently, there are two (2) vacant positions in the PIU – Engineer and Procurement Specialist. The Ministry needs to
                         have a core team on board as soon as possible so that the Project is implemented smoothly.

                         It is critical to ensure quality of the water sources in all Project participating villages. The Bank team has been notified of the issue of unsatisfactory water quality in some Project
                         villages (Bestemac and Navirnet). During the April 2012 mission the Bank had already requested that several samples be tested for each borehole by independent laboratories, to
                         ensure that the results are reliable and representative. This request has not been fully addressed todate. It was agreed that, by October 10, 2012, the Project Implementation Unit

                         would undertake, for each borehole of the ten (10) villages, two additional analysis of water samples and submit all results to the Bank
