BRAZIL
PROGRAMMATIC FISCAL REFORM STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
Borrower:         Federative Republic of Brazil
Implementing      Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Planning and Budget.
Agencies:
Poverty Category:  Not Applicable.
Amount:           US$757.58 million (including financing of the front-end fee). This is the
first of two, and possibly three loans, totaling $1.2 - 1.5 billion and
supporting a program of fiscal reform actions.
Terms:            Fixed-spread loan in US dollars, with a repayment period of 12 years
including five years of grace.
Commitment Fee:  0.85% per annum during the first four years and 0.75% per annum
thereafter on undisbursed loan amounts, beginning to accrue sixty days
after the loan agreement is signed.
Front-End Fee     1% of the loan amount, to be financed under the loan.
Objective:        Strengthen the foundations for improved growth, poverty reduction and
public service delivery by improving (i) aggregate fiscal performance
through incentives for fiscal responsibilities, and (ii) the use of public
resources, through better allocation and technical efficiency of
expenditures, including better service delivery to Brazil's citizens and
improved debt management.
Description:      The Program consists of series of actions undertaken during a two year
period 2001-2002 to imnprove fiscal performance. The actions cover
implementation of the Fiscal Stability Plan and the Law of Fiscal
Responsibility (LFR); upgrading of the federal financial management
system, development of the federal multi-annual expenditure plan (the
Plano Pluriannual or PPA) framework, completion of administrative
reform, and implementation of a program to bring Federal debt
Management institutions closer to best practice.
Benefits          Benefits include: (i) continued aggregate fiscal balance; (ii) improved
fiscal planning, transparency, and performance incentives, including
stronger incentives for sub-national fiscal adjustment and
creditworthiness; (iii) an improved federal financial management system,
(iv) improved incentives for civil service performance; (v) a long term
expenditure framework (the PPA), closely linked to the budget, achieving
a more transparent and better allocation and technical efficiency of
expenditures, and strengthening national/subnational and
government/private sector partnerships; (vi) improved delivery of public



services to Brazilian citizens; and (vii) quality of debt management raised
to international best practice for large open economies.
Risks               *  External or domestic shocks with an adverse bearing on domestic
interest rates, growth, and fiscal performance. This risk is mitigated
by the high probability that, as with previous shocks, the government
will take effective macro/fiscal measures to manage shocks;
*  Weak enforcement of LFR with an adverse effect on fiscal planning
or fiscal execution. This risk is mitigated by Brazil's demonstrated
high commitment to fiscal sustainability and by the positive
contribution of the LFR to an orderly fiscal planning and budget
execution process that will help sustainability;
*  Weak management of PPA process, resulting in a weakening of the
PPA approach. This risk is mitigated by the Government's
demonstrated commitment to the new PPA approach, by
institutionalization of the PPA at the constitutional level, and by the
usefulness of the approach to plan and manage budget priorities;
*  Inadequate consensus on completion of administrative reform, with
an adverse bearing on personnel costs, on personnel management,
and on the quality of service delivery. This risk is mitigated by other
possible measures to contain personnel costs, including continued
restraint on employment and wage growth.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED PROGRAMMATIC FISCAL REFORM
STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT OPERATION TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF
BRAZIL FOR BRAZIL'S FISCAL REFORM PROGRAM
INTRODUCTION
1.    This memorandum proposes a Programmatic Fiscal Reform Structural Adjustment Loan
(PFRSAL) to the Federative Republic of Brazil. The loan would be the first of two, or possibly
three loans to support an ongoing program of fiscal reforms covering fiscal sustainability,
expenditure management, and debt management. The second or third one-tranche adjustment
operations would be proposed to the Board once further progress has been achieved in the
reforms under the program. The reforms supported by the loans would be completed during
2001-2002. The proposed first loan would be US$757.58 million. It follows the Fiscal and
Administrative Reform Special Sector Adjustment Loan approved in March 2000, which
supported initial implementation of the Government's fiscal stability plan, approval and
implementation of Administrative Reform, and the refinancing of the state's debts.' The
proposed loan is preceded by extensive analytical work, including periodic fiscal monitoring, a
fiscal sector report2, a debt management report3 and active policy dialogue on debt management
issues, and ongoing work and dialogue on Brazil's new multi-annual budget planning practices
and on financial management4. The proposed loan is being complemented by a Programmatic
Financial Reform Structural Adjustment Loan. Both structural adjustment loans will be
complemented, in turn, by related Technical Assistance (TA) operations, with the fiscal reform
TA loan covering possible assistance in the four areas of the PFRSAL, namely fiscal,
expenditure, financial management and debt management.
2.    The objective of the Program is to strengthen the foundations for improved growth,
poverty reduction and public service delivery to citizens by improving Brazil's fiscal
performance through continued efforts at attaining fiscal sustainability, improved allocation and
efficiency of public sector expenditures (including better delivery of public services to citizens),
and improved efficiency of debt management. Improved performance in these regards will help
reduce poverty, through three main venues. First, aggregate fiscal adjustment will help reduce
real interest rates, increase growth, with higher growth accelerating poverty reduction. Second,
better use of public resources will increase the impact of public expenditures on the welfare of
' The follow up loan was originally envisaged as a second special sector adjustment loan which would support the
new Fiscal Responsibility Law and the approval of pending legislation regarding administrative reform. As the
emergency conditions that prompted the Bank's special assistance have now subsided, support for additional reforms
is being proposed at the Bank's standard terms.

the poor. And third, special public expenditure programs are targeted to improve the quality in
the delivery of public services in general, with public services (e.g. health and education) largely
targeted to the poor. The first loan in the program would support measures and actions that have
already been enacted and are being implemented, including Brazil's Fiscal Stability Program, the
Fiscal Responsibility Law, the reform of Brazil's federal multi-annual expenditure planning and
management process, and institutional reforms in asset liability management. The next one or
two loans of the programs would support further actions in these areas. The expected outcomes
from these measures and actions include (i) a sustained overall public sector fiscal balance that
will allow the ratio of public sector net debt to GDP to remain stable or decline; (ii) improve
fiscal planning, transparency and performance, including stronger incentives for sub-national
fiscal adjustment and creditworthiness; (iii) a long term expenditure framework (the PPA),
closely linked to the budget, achieving an increase in the strategic content of expenditures
(including partnerships of the federal government with sub-national governments and of
governments with the private sector), as well as in their outcome orientation, transparency and
efficiency (both in terms of their allocation across programs as of their results in each program);
(iv) an improved federal financial management system, (v) improved incentives for civil service
performance; (vi) an improvement in the quality of public service delivery to Brazilian citizens,
including better services to the poor; and (iv) an increase in the efficiency of debt management.
3.    These changes help consolidate the major transformation that Brazil's public sector has
been experiencing over the last several years in order to become more effectively strategic and
results-oriented. The changes reflect a vision whereby the public sector should move from a
bureaucratic state to a managerial state, with a focus in the areas where it can be effective. This
movement is sharply reflected in the reforms supported by the proposed operation: a Fiscal
Responsibility Law that steers the public sector towards planning and management of fiscal
objectives; a programmatic approach that focuses expenditure management to the attainment of
results with a bearing on the welfare of Brazil's citizens; an improvement in debt management
institutions that seeks to provide the accountability and the capacity to effectively manage
Brazil's large public debt; a reform to make the government's financial management system
responsive to the government's managerial requirements in those areas. This movement also
makes the public sector more likely to contribute to the country's growth and poverty reduction.
By ensuring fiscal stability and a strategic approach to expenditures, Brazil's public sector will
better encourage private investment, private sector synergies, and public sector coordination to
raise economic activity. The Bank's partnership with the Government with regard to these
important changes is at the core of the 2000 CAS, which envisages adjustment lending in support
of structural fiscal reforms and, most specifically, improvements in fiscal institutions and public
sector management for better fiscal performance and incentives for fiscal discipline.5 The
remainder of this memorandum discusses Brazil's fiscal reform program in detail and the
proposed PFRSAL.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND POLICIES
4.    Since the early 1990s, Brazil has been engaged in a major reform of its economy, moving
away from import substitution and state-owned enterprises towards greater emphasis on private
initiative, competition and international integration. Considerable progress has been made in
controlling inflation and creating an improved economic environment for private enterprise,
fiscal adjustment and reform of the public sector. From 1992 to 1997 Brazil experienced a very
successful growth performance. Annual growth averaged 4.2%, a major improvement over the
average for the previous five-year period (0.0%). Factors contributing to this positive outcome
include a trade liberalization during the early 1990s and a well-designed and implemented
economic stabilization program initiated in mid-1994 (the Real Plan), together with a favorable
international economic environment. By contrast, the two and a half years from mid- 1997 to end-
1999 saw a much more volatile international economic environment with a series of crises in
international markets. These crises adversely affected growth in Latin America and Brazil was
no exception. The average rate of growth during 1998-99 was only 0.3%. However, by the end of
1999, recovery, led by the industrial sector (particularly consumer durables and capital goods),
was firmly established. GDP growth rates between the last quarter of 1998 and the last quarter of
1999 and between each of the first two quarters of 1999 and the first two quarters of 2000
averaged 3.9%, close to the 4.0% consensus estimate of Brazil's likely average growth over the
next several years.
5.    As a result of the stabilization plan introduced in 1994, annual inflation declined from
over 2000% in 1993 to less than 2% in 1998. Even the large currency depreciation of January
1999 had a fairly limited small pass-through impact on inflation. Inflation in 1999 was contained
to about 20% on broad price indices and around 8% on consumer price indices. This was the
result of sluggish aggregate demand and continued monetary tightness. Following the change in
the exchange rate regime in 1999, from a crawling band to a floating rate, Brazil introduced a
sophisticated inflation targeting framework. Targets were set at 8%, 6%, 4% and 4% respectively
for the IPCA index duringl999-2002, with a margin on each side of two percentage points.
Inflation in 1999 was 8.9%. Inflation during the 12-month period through November, 2000 was
6%, which is exactly the mid-point of the governments 2000 target. In its September 2000
inflation report, BCB expected an inflation below 4% for 2001 (somewhat lower than the
market's median expectation in September of 4.3% for 2001). With an improved fiscal
framework and assuming an absence of external shocks, the inflation targets for 2001-02 remain
realistic. These targets provide the anchor for the Government's monetary policy.
6.    Fiscal policy performance has also improved considerably. As early as 1995, the
Government attempted to address the structural fiscal deficit unmasked by price stability.
However, lack of legislative consensus meant that fiscal adjustment lagged behind other parts of
the economic reform program. As a result, Brazil has been dependent on large capital inflows.
This dependence coupled with the prevailing exchange rate regime implied vulnerability to
sentiments in international markets. The Government responded competently and effectively to
the loss of market confidence in late-1998 and early-1999 with a combination of tightened
monetary policy and fast-acting fiscal adjustment measures coupled with a new drive for
structural fiscal reforms. Throughout 1999 and 2000, fiscal adjustment has been carried out with



4
tremendous effort and remarkable discipline and is achieving the ambitious targets that were set.
These measures, taken together with the shift to a floating exchange rate in January 1999 have
been successful in preserving economic stability and regaining market confidence. Provided the
external environment remains benign, Brazil is now approaching steady, non-inflationary
growth. Brazil's remaining economic vulnerability results from its continuing, though declining,
fiscal and current account deficits. As fiscal deficits are closely correlated with current account
deficits, fiscal adjustment at both national and sub-national levels are critical for continuing to
reduce vulnerability and restore growth.

7.    Following a period of increasing poverty from 1987-1994, the Real Plan significantly
reduced poverty levels during the period 1994-1998. The national headcount ratio (using a
poverty line of R$65 per capita per month at 1996 prices) declined from 34% in 1993 to 22% in
19986. This beneficial effect was due to: (i) economic growth and rising real wages; (ii) the end
of inflation (salary erosion and inflation tax); (iii) a significant appreciation of the local currency
shifting relative prices toward the service sectors in which most of the poor work; and (iv) a
significant increase in the minimum wage to which important income sources, such as pensions,
are tied. Despite these advances, Brazil continues to be a country with high income inequality
and a high level of poverty for its level of per-capita income. The average 1998 headcount ratio
of 21.7% masks important regional differences, with regional headcount ratios ranging from
8.5% in the South East to 47.3% in the North-East.
8.     The succession of economic crises since 1997 has affected the poor mainly through
reduced labor demand and the resulting reduction in employment and/or real wages.
Nevertheless, since economic performance in 1999 was much better than feared at the time of the
devaluation in early 1999 and key social expenditures have been protected, the negative poverty
impact of the crisis was much less severe than expected. According to available measurements of
labor incomes 7, the headcount poverty rate in six metropolitan areas dropped from a peak of
35.3% in July 1994 to a low of 24.6% in October 1997. The rate increased continuously from
November 1997 until March 1999, when it reached 30.0%. The latest data through 2000 shows a
reduction in poverty rates indicating a reversal in the negative crisis impact. Country-wide
indicators show a trend of slowly reducing labor income inequality. The rate of open
unemployment reached a high of 8.2% in March 1999 and has since fallen to 6.8% (October
2000). Data from the 1999 PNAD national household survey (fielded in September 1999) show
that the national poverty rate has risen by 1.3 percentage points compared to 1998. The one-time
poverty gains of stabilization achieved from 1993-95, however, remain essentially intact.
Interestingly, the largest increase in poverty between 1998 and 1999 occurred in the relatively
wealthier southern and metropolitan areas, whereas the increase in poverty in the poor northeast
and rural areas was minimal.
6      Poverty data here come from a Bank Draft Report No. 20475-BR "Attacking Brazil's Poverty" based on
the 1998 PNAD household survey and a food-only poverty line.
7     Data from the Monthly Employmnent Survey, PME, undertaken by IBGE. This survey most likely
exaggerates the negative impact of the crisis since it is limited to six metropolitan areas (most likely the hardest hit
areas) and excludes income from transfer programs which would have compensated for some of the loss of labor
income.

9.    Government support for the poor during the difficult 1998-99 period has been overall
effective. Supported by the Bank's Social Protection S/SECAL and a parallel operation by the
IDB, the Federal Government has effectively protected the expenditures for a core set of 22
selected priority social programs in the areas of education, health, labor, and social assistance,
considered to be particularly effective in reaching the poor. Despite the drastic overall cuts in the
1999 budget, allocations for these programs (totaling about R$12 billion) were protected near or
above their 1998 levels. Total actual spending for these protected programns in 1999 has slightly
exceeded the Government commitments. The Government's budget for 2000 implied an increase
in funding for the total of the 22 programs of 20% over the 1999 budget proposal and 12% over
the approved 1999 budget, including very significant increases for relatively new and promising
programs that link transfer payments to poor families to children's school attendance (Child
Labor Eradication Program, and Bolsa Escola).8 Sub-national Governments have also
contributed to social protection in the crisis period, for example through work-fare programs
implemented by several states and municipalities. At the same time, the Federal Government is
proceeding with a program to improve the quality and targeting of spending in the social area.
The remaining third tranche of the IDB's Social Protection Loan is linked to physical
performance indicators of the protected programs and a program of studies and steps to improve
targeting and quality of these programs. In addition, the Bank would follow with particular
interest the strengthening of the implementation framework (monitoring and evaluation,
technical assistance, training, and capacity building for participating municipalities, etc.) for the
transfer programs linked to school attendance discussed above.
10.   An irnportant new development on national social policies and social spending has been
the announcement of the Projeto Alvorada by the President in mid-2000. This program
encompasses spending of about R$11.5bn during 2000-2002 for 14 social programs. Out of this
R$11.5bn, R$4.lbn were already included in the original budget plan/PPA, R$2.2bn are new
regular budget funds, R$1.1bn are proposed World Bank and IDB loans including their state
counterparts, and R$4.2bn are from a new poverty reduction fund that has been approved by
Congress in December 2000. The largest incremental funding from this initiative goes to income
transfer programs linked to school attendance ("Bolsa Escola") and basic sanitation in poor
communities. In both cases, the Bank is providing technical support to the implementing
agencies. The program is directed at the states and microregions with the lowest Human
Development Index. The earlier program name IDH-14 indicated its targeting at the 14 states
with the lowest Human Development Index. Consistent with the emphasis of the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy, the program is highly concentrated in the poor Northeast region. It is guided
by the principle of better poverty targeting of social spending at both the geographic and the
household level and the improved coordination and integration of social programs across sectors.
As such, the program potentially addresses two of the main shortcomings of social policies in
Brazil to date.
11.   The 2001 budget proposal also includes continued funding for the 22 social protection
programs whose budget was protected, with Bank and IDB support, during the crisis of 1998/99.
These 22 programs were selected at the time as those most essential as social protection during
the crisis. While the Projeto Alvorada includes some of these 22 programs, it has a stronger
medium-term orientation toward social investments addressing the factors underlying poverty
8     The Bank has assessed these programs in a draft Bank report "An Assessment of the Bolsa Escola Program
in Brazil" and an ongoing study of the Child Labor Eradication Program.

and low human development. It thus includes increased funding for several areas that were
significantly cut during the crisis, for example sanitation.

with the joint effect of other structural social
policies and improved social protection, and if recent improvements in outcomes from
educational policies continue.
13.   The proposed operation contributes to reduce poverty in three ways:



7
* First the macroeconomic management, fiscal management, and debt management
components reduce poverty through their positive impact on growth. Increased growth results
from lower real interest rates. Lower interest rates result from a lower risk premium due to
macroeconomic stability and to lower public sector debt levels. Lower debt levels, in turn,
are to be a consequence of the higher surpluses that the public sector will generate as a result
of better fiscal and debt management. The impact of interest rates on growth has been found
to be significant and powerful.
*  Second, in the expenditure management component, the reform of the public expenditure
process introduced through a new approach to planning (the new PPA) will reduce poverty
through its positive impact on the allocation of public expenditures and on expenditure
management. In the PPA process, program managers monitor the attainment of program
targets and the problems that emerge throughout program implementation. Managers or
higher management at the ministerial level work continuously to resolve those problems.
Moreover programs and program management will be evaluated on a yearly basis. These
evaluations translate into budget programming each year and into changes in the way the
programs are managed. As many public sector programs are targeted to raising the rate of
growth or directly to the poor (see Box 1), particularly in the areas of health and education,
improved budget allocation towards effective programs and management improvement result
in more effective actions to reduce poverty through public expenditure.
- Third, the PPA will also help reduce poverty through four specific programs to improve the
quality of service delivery: i) a public service quality Program through better management
techniques and improved recognition to good civil service teams; (ii) a program to reduce
bureaucratic weight; (iii) a program to improve the performnance of public agencies through
results oriented management; (iv) and a program to improve civil service capacity for results
oriented public management.' Again, since much of public expenditure is targeted to the
poor, these programs should contribute to reduce poverty.
THE FISCAL REFORM PROGRAM
14.   Following the Fiscal and Administrative Reform Loan approved last March, the operation
proposed here is being designed to support a deepening of Brazil's fiscal reforms. Brazirs present
fiscal reform efforts can be classified in four closely related areas: (i) fiscal balance; (ii)
structure, assignment and earmarking of taxes; (iii) allocation and technical efficiency of
expenditures; and (iv) debt management. Reforms in these areas are aimed at improving
economic efficiency through macroeconomic stability, restructuring of taxes and expenditures,
and better choices of risks and return in assets and liabilities. Main issues and reforms in these
areas are discussed in turn, followed by a brief reference to other reforms that have been
completed.

FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
15.    The Fiscal Stability  Program. Since  1998, as indicated  before, Brazil has been
successfully implementing an IMF supported program to generate primary surpluses that are
consistent with a sustainable public sector net debt path. The Fiscal Stability Program for 1999-
01, introduced by the Federal Government in October 1998 and strengthened in March 1999,
responded to the considerable financial turbulence that Brazil experienced in 1998, as a result of
the adverse international financial environment and Brazil's expansionary fiscal policy through
1998. The program originally called for public sector primary surpluses of 3.1%, 3.25%, and
3.35% of GDP respectively for 1999, 2000, and 2001. Table 1 shows fiscal performance since
1991. The target for 1999 was met (3.13%) and the target for 2000 (revised to 3.4% of GDP due
to revised GDP) is likely to be met as well (the primary surplus through October was 4% of
GDP). The target for 2001 has been revised down to 3.0%  and the target for 2002 was set at
2.7%. By October 2000, the Government had reduced the debt/GDP ratio to 49.0% of GDP
(from 53.4%  in January 1999, its highest point after the floating of the exchange rate) of GDP.
The debt/GDP ratio by the end of 2000 is likely to be within 49%-50%. The original target for
end-2001 under the program (46.5% of GDP) was dropped in October, 2000 due to an
unexpected drop in the growth of the GDP deflator, as measured by IBGE. The Government now
expects that the Debt/GDP ratio will fall within 46%-48%.' To strengthen fiscal sustainability,
the Government is also implementing a major improvement in debt management institutions, as
discussed fuirther below in this report. A declining debt path is a necessary condition to lower
real interest rates, increase growth, and thereby contribute to Brazil's poverty reduction efforts.

assumptions with regard to inflation (4%,), nominal interest rate (14.85%,), and growth (4.5%,) for 2001; furthermore, it was assumed that new
recognition of old liabilities will amount to 1.2% of GDP per year and that privatization revenues will amount to 0.6% of GDP.
16.    Table 2 shows a scenario based largely on the assumptions spelled out in the 2001
Budget Guidelines Law (LDO, Law  9995/2000) approved by Congress in July. 12 The scenario
and the underlying assumptions in the LDO  reflect the Law  of Fiscal Responsibilitv (LFR)
approved in March (discussed below), which requires governments to establish fiscal targets and
their underlying assumptions in LDOs. Under this scenario the debt/GDP ratio is estimated to

absolute monetary values, not in percentages of GDP. The end-September 2000 debt level (R548 billion) was below
the indicative target for the month.
12 The Budget Guidelines Law (Lei de Diretrizes Orqamentarias,or LDO), submitted by the Executive to Congress
in April of each year, establishes federal budget targets and priorities, provides guidance for the budget law,
indicates changes in tax legislation, and establishes policies for official development agencies.

continue declining, to about 43.8% by 2003. The table shows the assumptions of the scenario.
These can be used to highlight issues raised by the fiscal picture and Government policies. These
assumptions refer to the level of the primary surplus, real interest and growth rates, privatization
revenues, and recognition of liabilities. The public sector primary surpluses that the Government
targets for the whole public sector reflectfederal primary surpluses of 2.6%, 2.2%, and 1.8% of
GDP for 2001-03. The overall public sector primary surplus targets of 3% of GDP for 2001 and
2.7% of GDP for 2002 would be attained with sub-national and public enterprise primary
surpluses, which amounted to about 0.9% of GDP in 1999.13 Policies to attain fiscal outcomes at
the federal level are expected to continue focusing on continued tax collection efforts and control
of personnel expenditures (both wages and retirement benefits), while expenditures, particularly
on health and education, are expected to increase significantly. At the sub-national level, the
fiscal targets under the debt refinancing agreements signed between the federal government and
most states and some municipalities as well and the provisions of the Law of Fiscal
Responsibility discussed further below are assumed to encourage improved fiscal performance at
the sub-national level.

Source: Staff Estimates; projections for 2002, 2002, and 2003 based on Government LDO assumptions with regard to
inflation (4%, 3.5%, 3.0%), nominal interest rate (14.85%, 12.32%, 11.25), and growth (4.5%, 5%, 5%/6); furthermore, it
was assumed that new recognition of old liabilities will amount to 1.2% of GDP per year and that privatization revenues
will amount to 0.6% of GDP per year.
17.    The LDO assumes declining real interest rates, from about 26% in 1999 to about 11% in
2003. Given inflation assumptions, the real interest rate would remain stable at around 8% during
2000-03. This scenario reflects a prudent monetary policy that needs to weigh the impact of
declining rates on aggregate demand, on the exchange rate, and on the cost of the public debt.
Under the projections the public sector's interest bill, declines from 7.2% of GDP in 1999 to
4.5% in 2003, as a result of the assumed decline in the interest rate and the debt/GDP ratio.
18.    The LDO assumes GDP growth rates of 4.5%, 5%, and 5%  respectively during 2001-
2003, up from 0.2% and 1.1% respectively during 1998-99. As indicated before, growth has
accelerated since the last quarter of 1999. While the indicated assumptions are higher than
Brazil's recent historical record, they are well below the more bullish assessments of Brazil's
growth potential. The Government has a well developed growth policy framework, that focuses
'3 To project the overall primary surplus for 2003, it was assumed that the same difference between the overall result
and the federal primary surplus (of about 0.5% of GDP) during 2001-02 would apply in 2003. Added to the 2002
LDO federal surplus (1.8%), the consolidated public sector primary surplus for that year would be 2.3% of GDP.

on investments to improve the country's chief development axes, on a stable macroeconomic
framework, and on stronger linkages to the world economy. A pessimistic growth rate
throughout, say 3% flat during 2000-2003, would allow an stabilization, but not a decline, of the
debt GDP ratio at around 49%.
19.   Finally, the LDO assumes continued privatization revenues through 2001, more than
offset by new recognition of old liabilities. The Government's policy has been to gradually
recognize past or emerging contingent liabilities. Among these, the major new liability is a court
awarded index correction on accumulated debts that emerged from worker contributions to the
Time in Service Guarantee Fund (Fundo de Garantia por Tempo de Servi,co, FGTS)14. The LDO
anticipates recognition of liabilities amounting to R$13.2 billion in 2001.
20.   Continued implementation of the Government's Fiscal Stability Program for 1999-2001,
and the LDO targets beyond 2001 provide the overall fiscal framework for the proposed
Programmatic Sector Adjustment Loan. The 1999-2001 Program is supported by IMF under the
Stand-by Agreement that expires in December], 2001. The program has been rigorously
implemented. Bank staff will continue closely monitoring macroeconomic policies, including
fiscal policies and management, together with the authorities and in coordination with the IMF,
with a view to early identification of possible areas of concern and corrective actions as
appropriate, so as to help ensure effective implementation of the program supported by the loan.
21.   Fiscal Responsibility. The Fiscal Stability Program  discussed above introduced a
consistent framework for fiscal sustainability. The key issue with aggregate fiscal planning in
Brazil has been the weakness of the link between expenditure and revenue flows, on the one
hand, and net public debt levels, on the other. That is, expenditure levels more often than not
were set without adequate consideration of the implications of those levels on debt, the burden of
which falls on subsequent administrations. By way of example, Table 1 above shows how,
through 1998, sub-national governments ran primary deficits which were not sufficiently offset
by federal primary surpluses. As a result, the burden of interest costs increased the stock of debt.
The example suggests weak constraints on indebtedness, particularly at the state level.
22.   In May of this year, Congress approved a new fiscal code (Complementary Law 101,
2000 - known as Law of Fiscal Responsibility (Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal), or LFR. This
Law firmly establishes fiscal sustainability planning and implementation to governments at all
levels, as introduced by the Federal Government through its Fiscal Stability Program, described
above. The new law, based on Article 163 of Brazil's Constitution (requiring the regulation of
public finances)1 , covers (i) fiscal targets; (ii) mechanisms to correct deviations from fiscal
targets; (iii) a mechanism to encourage accurate revenue projections; (iv) limits on permanent
expenditure increases, personnel expenditures, net debt, gross bonded federal debt, and
borrowing; (v) prohibition of intergovernmental lending, except through guarantees or by public
14 The FGTS is a mandatory severance pay arrangement funded by an 8% employer contribution on wages that
yields a real annual rate of return of 3% per year. The new liability emerged from a court ruling, following more
than a decade of legal questionings, that awarded creditors of the FGTS a correction of 68.89% in creditor balances
due to under-correction of balances during the failed Bresser (1987) and Collor I and 2 (1989 and 1990)
stabilization plans. The Federal Mortgage Bank (Caixa Economica Federal) has estimated that additional expenses
due to the ruling will amount to R$58 billion.
'5 The LFR covers public finance and debt. It does not regulate the budget process, which is covered by Article 165
(9, 11) of the Constitution. The budget process is presently regulated by Law 4320 of 1964.



11
financial institutions; (vi) transparency (disclosure of fiscal laws, accounts and reports); and (vii)
federal consolidation of overall public sector accounts and a federal registry of public sector
debt. Enactment of the Law represents a major breakthrough in terms of addressing Brazil's
structural fiscal problems: it will allow Brazil to complete the transition from a past where a
disregard for the impact of expenditures on debt led to an unsustainable fiscal stance, to a new
environment in which sustainability comes to the forefront in determining aggregate
expenditures and indebtedness.
23.   Under the LFR, a government (national or sub-national) must establish fiscal targets
(revenues, expenditures, nominal and primary balances, and debt) for the next three years in its
LDO (para. I of LFR Article 4), a key part of the budget cycle (Box 2 describes the budget
cycle). As indicated above (para. 16), the Federal Government established primary surpluses of
2.6%, 2.2%, and 1.8% of GDP for 2001-03 in the 2001 LDO, which also includes targets for the
other fiscal variables required. Under the LFR, 2002 LDOs for all governments are required to
establish and disclose targets. This will provide the federal government with the opportunity,
each year, to assess the overall public sector's fiscal stance for the following three years. Under
the proposed program of Bank support, the first of these assessments would be completed prior
to follow-up loan(s). Under the

derived from higher tax rates, bases, or from new taxes).
26.   The LFR establishes ceilings on the ratio of personnel expenditures to net revenues
(50% for the federal government; 60% for states and municipalities) and on the distribution of
those ceilings among branches of government16. These ceilings are to be met by the end of 2001.
States have been gradually adjusting to these levels. The overall ratio of personnel expenditures
declined from 68.0% in 1998 to 65.6% in 1999.This is close to the adjustment projectedfor 1999
under the Fiscal and Administrative Reform Loan (65.2%o). The projections for 2000 and 2001
respectively are 60.5% and 58.1%. These are likely to be achieved, given stronger revenue
growth during 2000-01.
27.   The LFR provides for numerical debt ceilings set by the Senate. The Government has
submitted to the Senate two draft senate resolutions on the maximum ratio of net debt to net
current revenues for the federal government and for sub-national governments. The draft
resolution on net federal debt establishes a maximum net debt/revenue ratio of 3.5. The ratio is
presently 3.45. The draft resolution of sub-national debt establishes a maximum debt/revenue
ratio of 2.0 for states and of 1.2 for municipalities. As many states and municipalities exceed
these ratios, a linear adjustment during a fifteen year period is contemplated. Most states and
some municipalities will remain subject to debt/revenue conditions under the debt refinancing
agreements that they recently signed with the federal government. Senate approval of these
resolutions is expected prior to Board Presentation of the second or third loan under the
proposed PFRSAL.
28.   In addition, the Government, as required by the LFR, has submitted for Congress
approval a draft bill establishing a maximum ratio of gross bonded federal debt to net current
revenue. The proposed limit of 6.5 exceeds the present ratio (5.5) to account for an expected
issuance of Treasury Bills to be held by the Central Bank, to accommodate new liabilities
emerging from pending debt recognition, and to accommodate the substitution of new bonded
debt for other debt (e.g., contractual debt). Together with the LFR prohibition of
intergovernmental lending, these resolutions are aimed at further strengthening fiscal discipline
through borrowing constraints.
29.   To achieve transparency, the LFR requires governments to disclose and widely
disseminate multi-annual plans (PPA's, see Box 1), LDOs (see Box 1), budgets, public accounts,
public debt, budget implementation reports (issued every two months), and fiscal management
reports (reporting on compliance with LFR provisions and issued every fourth month). Under the
proposed program of Bank support, approval of a second or third loan would follow a dramatic
improvement of the level of information on public finance, particularly with regard to the sub-
national levels. Furthermore, the Government will have achieved the first consolidations of
public accounts (for the year 2000) as well as disclosure of sub-national debt levels in a new
debt registry to be created at the Ministry of Finance.
30.   Enforcement of LFR provisions relies on fiscal and penal remedies. LFR remedies
include prohibition of new credit operations and guarantees and voluntary transfers for several
16 The distributed percentages for the federal legislative, judiciary, executive, and ministerio publico (Attorney
General's Office) respectively are 2.5%, 6%, 40.9%, and 0.6% for the federal level; and 3%, 6%, 49%, and 2% for
the state level. In municipalities, the personnel revenue ratio cannot exceed 54% and the other branches together
cannot exceed 6%. A legal challenge to these percentages was recently rejected by the Supreme Court.

events of non-compliance. Furthermore, Congress approved a Fiscal Crimes Law, which
includes dismissal (with possible reparation payments), prison, and fines as possible penalties to
those responsible for various fiscal crimes. The new law (Law No. 10.028 of October 19, 2000),
added non-compliance with certain LFR provisions to Brazil's Penal Code (Decree-Law 2848 of
1940), to Law 1079 of 1950 (covering misconduct by federal and state authorities, including the
president, the attorney general (procurador geral), ministers, governors, and state secretaries),
and to Decree-Law 201 of 1967 (covering misconduct of municipal elected officials). As a result,
under the Penal Code officials that borrow illegally, that include uncommitted expenditures or
expenditures exceeding limits in accounts payable (restos a pagar ), that instruct payment of
non-authorized expenditures, that grant guarantees without required counter-guarantees, that fail
to clear amounts exceeding legal limits in accounts payable, that raise personnel expenditures
during the last year in office of an administration, or that issue unauthorized public debt bonds,
are now subject to imprisonment.
31.   Also, under Law 1079, officials (president, ministers, governors, state secretaries, and
attorneys general) that do not instruct the reduction of debt to legal limits, that instruct or
autnorize expenditures not included in the budget, that fail to repay/cancel loans made exceeding
limits, that fail to repay advanced revenue loans (Antecipagao de Receita Orqamentaria) within
the year for which these are authorized, that instruct or authorize illegal intergovernrnental
lending, that borrow against un-accrued future tax receipts, that use the proceeds of bond issues
for a different destination than that for which they were intended, or that extended or received
voluntary transfers in conflict with legal provisions, are now to be fired. Under Decree-Law 201,
the same applies to municipal elected officials.
32.   Finally, under the new Law of Fiscal Crimes, officials that fail to disseminate the Fiscal
Management Report, to send LDO proposals without the Annex of Fiscal Targets, to reduce
expenditure commitments and payments (movimentadaofinanceira) when required by law, or to
implement measures to reduce personnel expenditures to legal limits, are subject to a personal
fine of 30% of their annual salaries.
33.   Under the proposed PFRSAL, approval of a second or third operation  would follow
corroboration of implementation of the fiscal planning (analysis and consolidation of fiscal
annexes by the Federal Government, para. 23) and transparency provisions (consolidation of
fiscal accounts and registry of public sector debts by the Federal Government, para. 29) of the
LFR..
34.   Other Reforms. The Government's reform programs includes other reforms with a
bearing of aggregate fiscal performance. These include chiefly social security reform,
administrative reform, and the refinancing of sub-national debt and are summarized as follows:
* The debt refinancing agreements with most states and some municipalities strengthen the
budget constraints faced by these governments through (I) a collateralization of debt service
obligations (which are guaranteed by federal transfers, grants, and taxes) which is forcing
fiscal adjustment at the sub-national level ; (ii) a commitment to a set of fiscal targets (gross
debt/revenue   ratio,   primary   balance,   personnel   expenditures,  revenues,
privatization/concessions, investment expenditures.



14
* Under the Administrative Reform approved in 1998, governments will be able to dismiss
personnel when their personnel expenditures exceed limits (full regulation of this provision,
still to be completed, is an expected action prior to the second (or third) loan under the
proposed program of Bank support). Furthermore, the public sector will hire through the
private sector labor regime, under which retirement benefits are much lower (1.8 minimum
salaries) than under the public sector regime (13 minimum salaries, on the average). These
reforms will have an impact only in the long term.
* Social security reforms, which have increased contribution time, reduced retirement time,
reduced pension benefits, or increased contributions. These have temporarily stabilized the
social security deficit.
The Administrative Reform and the refinancing agreements were the focus of the Fiscal and
Administrative Reform Loan approved in March, 2000. As a result of those reforms and of the
related reforms discussed in this proposal, the fiscal performance of Brazil has improved, with a
declining debt burden at the federal level and stabilized the debt burden at the sub-national level
(para. 80). The impact of these reforms is expected to continue during the next several years.
STRUCTURE, ASSIGNMENT AND EARMARKING OF TAXES
35.   Brazil's public sector collects about 30% of GDP in taxes. Brazil's complex tax system
includes individual and corporate income taxes, imnport taxes, an industrial products tax, payroll
taxes, taxes on financial and checking account operations, and gross income taxes, all collected
by the Federal Government; a value added tax and motor vehicle taxes collected by states; and
real estate and service taxes. The federal government shares the income and industrial products
taxes with the states and municipalities. The states share the value added tax with municipalities.
Taxes are earmarked in various ways to expenditures, including earmarking of some federal
taxes to social expenditures as well as a minimum percentage of taxes to education.
36.   Three key issues have been raised about this tax system. First, the tax burden varies
widely across economic activities because value added tax rates vary widely and because the
burden of the cascading taxes, on which the tax system relies extensively, varies widely across
economic activities. The excessive number of taxes has responded partly to the need to raise
federal revenues to cover public sector expenditures that amount today to almost 30% of GDP.
Much of this additional revenue effort has had to be undertaken at the federal level because a
good part of other federal revenues are shared with states and municipalities.
37.   Second, assignment of an origin-based value added tax to states is believed to encourage
an inefficient location of economic activity, as states extend tax subsidies to attract industrial
investments. A related problem is that the origin based tax tends to concentrate revenues in the
large producing states and against exporting states. While this is partly corrected by applying a
lower tax rate on interstate trade, the resulting distribution of the valued added tax remains
inequitable across states
38.   Third, earmarking of revenues has introduced considerable rigidity to fiscal policy, as the
earmarking in effect puts a floor on certain expenditures, possibly limiting efficient choices in
fiscal adjustment and in budget programming. Constitutionally mandated earmarking of revenues
occurs chiefly through the federal social security budget, which earmarks about a third of public



15
sector taxes to social expenditures (education, health, retirement and severance benefits). Other
constitutional earmarking mandates include labor taxes (FGTS and Salario-Educa,do),
earmarked to finance severance payments, housing credit, and education; and 15% of
constitutional transfers and of the ICMS, which are earmarked to finance primary education
expenses. These constitutional mandates earmark about half of total public sector taxes to public
expenditures in the social sector. While these earmarking provisions may improve the stability of
financing of some areas of expenditures, they have also proved to be a constraint on budget
management. As a result of this constraint, Brazil established the Fiscal Stabilization Fund (now
the DRU Desvincula,do das Receitas da Uniao ), which "taxes" 20% of the earmarked proceeds
to improve the flexibility of the budget. Nevertheless, remaining earmarking and expenditure
rigidities have continued to make it difficult to contain expenditures when fiscal considerations
require it. As a matter of fact, expenditure rigidities are a constraint on the PPA process,
inasmuch as this process aims to reallocate expenditures to priority areas.
39.   Fourth, sharing of federal revenues has possibly inhibited tax collection effort at the state
and local levels. States received 20% of its revenues from federal constitutional transfers in
1998, but spent 25% on transfers to municipalities. At the state level, transfers in the form of
debt forgiveness have been the main factor discouraging efforts at better collection of their value
added tax. Municipalities received 71% of their revenues as transfers from the federal
government and the states; this may explain weak efforts to collect the taxes assigned to them
(chiefly the services tax and the urban real estate tax).
40.   Brazil has already implemented a number of reforms aimed at addressing the taxation
issues described above. Recent reforms of the personal income tax have helped to rationalize the
personal income tax base, for instance through partial integration of the personal and business
income tax systems. Also, a recent strengthening of intergovernmental lending provisions
through refinancing provisions (1998 Law 9496 and the related debt refinancing agreements,
supported by the Fiscal and Administrative reform Loan) and the Fiscal Responsibility Law, will
improve incentives for tax collection at the sub-national level. A reform to simplify the
complexity of the tax system and improve tax assignment has been extensively discussed in
Congress, although consensus with the executive has not been achieved yet. The most recent tax
proposal submitted by the Government would (i) establish national legislation for the value
added tax (in lieu of independent state-level legislation); (ii) shift the value added tax from an
origin-based tax to a destination based tax over a seven-year transition period; (iii) and replace
the existing cascading federal taxes by non-cascading taxes over a period of three years. This
proposal, which would require an amendment to the Constitution, is unlikely to be approved
before 2003.
41.   While a fundamental piece of the Government's reform agenda, pending tax reform has
not been included among the actions to be supported by the proposed Programmatic Sector
Adjustment operation. The reason is that, despite strong interest on all sides, the reform remains
controversial and the proposal will require two rounds of votes, with qualified majority, in each
house of Congress. Therefore, given the political cycle, with a change in administration in 2003,
there is a significant likelihood that approval of the reform will not take place within the 2000-02
horizon envisaged by the proposed operation. Nevertheless, should appropriate tax reform be
approved, the Bank would consider it and its implementation as part of the reforms to be
supported by a future loan, under the program of Bank support.



16
ALLOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY OF EXPENDITURES
42.   In Brazil's budget process (see Box 2), the PPA is the fundamental document that aims to
establish public sector priorities. A major fiscal reform underway is comprised by the actions to
make the PPA relevant, operational, and effective. The following paragraphs describe the
background of public sector planning and the reforms that have been introduced with the 1996-
99 and 2000-03 PPAs.
43.   Strateaic Budget Planning. Allocational and technical efficiency of expenditures (the
optimal distribution and management of expenditures) depends on adequate budget planning and
implementation environment and systems, including a modern public administration. Brazil's
modernized public administration has its origin in the 1930s, when the Getulio Vargas regime
conferred a new development role on the state and systems for a meritocratic civil service, public
procurement, and budget control were established. 17 The first systematic national plan  (the
1956-61 Targets Plan or Plano de Metas), implemented by the govermnent of Juscelino
Kubitscheck, identified "thirty targets/goals for specific bottlenecks in the economy" and their
achievements "required the cooperation of different government agencies as well as different
private sector actors."'8 The Targets Plan is usually described as having been a relative success
as a means to promote import-substitution industrialization in Brazil.
44.   Successive governments continued relying on various national development plans to
stimulate the country's industrial development. However, by the early 1980s, fiscal crises,
institutional disarray within the Government, the "exhaustion" of the import-substitution model
of economic development, and other structural constraints (e.g. the oil shocks) undermined
planning. During much of the 1980s and until the mid- 1 990s, high inflation resulting from fiscal
crises made matters worse, as budget execution inevitably diverged significantly from approved
budgets, rendering multi-year plans basically unusable as a tool for economic management. Thus
the capacity and the tradition of planning that the Brazilian state had acquired by the 1 950s (in
spite of the growing ineffectiveness of the more recent plans) were lost to a large extent in the
1980s.
45.   Three  structural developments  changed  the  planning  environment.  First, as
decentralization gained ground, particularly with the 1988 constitutional reform, planning
became more complex, as it also became decentralized and thus more subject to local approaches
and to political bargaining between the states and the federal government. Second, trade
liberalization and privatization during the 1 990s changed the focus of planning from industrial
promotion through protection and direct production of goods and services to regulation,
expenditures in social services, and certain strategic infrastructure investments where private
investors are unlikely to come in. Third, stabilization and improved fiscal discipline during the
second half of the 1990s now allows for an improved link of plans to budget.
46.   The Multiannual Plan. Against this background, the Government began development of
a new PPA framework with the previous PPA (1996-1999; Brasil en Afao), a program that
identified a number of key regional investments within a new planning framework (Box 3). The
distinguishing characteristics of the new PPA approach, as implemented thus far, are as follows:

1994, p. 67).



17
* The new PPA, entitled AvanVa Brasil, is based partially on an earlier diagnostic study
(Estudo dos Eixos Nacionais de Integraqao e Desenvolvimento, or Study of National Axes
for Integration and Development) that, based on the geographic and economic characteristics
of each of Brazil's region, identified priority investments of R$317 billion to be undertaken
by the public and private sector over eight years.
* The PPA is also based on other fiscal reforms, including setting a multi-year spending
framework, and introducing program and performance budgeting. Specifically, in Avanqa
Brasil, all Federal Government expenditures are grouped in 388 Programs, each with a
performance indicator and clear 2003 target (e.g., infant mortality levels). Each program is
comprised of set of activities or actions deemed relevant for achieving the target. A program
manager was appointed for each of the 388 programs, and is responsible for coordinating the
actions to achieve the PPA objective. The 2001 Budget was submitted on a program basis. In
budget formulation, resources (calculated by the Planning Ministry, not by the line
ministries) are allocated by program and objectives, rather than to administrative units
(Ministries). Avanqa Brasil also integrates capital and current expenditures under the same
Program categories, thus reinforcing the objective-based programmatic approach to public
expenditure management.
Box 3: BRASIL EM A(Jo MANAGEMENT MODEL
* Organization of actions in the form of projects
* Appointment of a manager for each project
* Flow of funds in proportion to progress of each project
* Management Information System: linkage of managers and other agents in a computerized network
* Cooperation to eliminate restrictions
Management and strategic content are the essence of the Brazil in Action program.
For each project, clear objectives and goals to be reached, physical and financial planning, cost controls, timeframes
and quality were defined. A manager responsible for implementing the goals was appointed.
The manager is charged with the task of organizing actions in various areas, mobilizing resources, maintaining
partnerships and overcoming obstacles to achieving the objectives.
A management information system was created. This is a computerized network operating in real time, linking all the
managers and partners and affording immediate access to data on all the projects. It became easier to identify
restrictions on the performance of each project, facilitating the search for solutions on the part of the government and
its partners. The system also made it possible to base the release of funds on the progress of each project. "

August 3, 2000. By Annex 1, Page 3.
* The PPA also has strategic aspects. Of the 388 programs, 87 have been designated as
strategic programs of the Government, meaning these program objectives are top
Government priorities with a preference in budget execution over other discretionary
programs. Further, the PPA explicitly acknowledges the means of program implementation,
or ways the goals would be attained. Specifically, the federal PPA is more aware and explicit
of the partnerships with sub-national governments and with the private sector in the
implementation of PPA goals. For example, in the delivery of health outcomes, a strong
interface between federal transfers and sub-national implementation is critical for success. In
infrastructure investment with a public interest, strong private sector ownership, financing,
and/or management are also necessary for attaining the goals. In this regard, the Government
is establishing the Brazilian Network of Investment Promotion (Invest in Brazil), which will



18
disseminate investment opportunities with the expectation of attracting investors to the
infrastructure and social projects envisaged in the PPA.
* A manager for each program has been appointed, with a view to promote better results
through management and accountability. In terms of management, appointed managers are
presently responsible for monitoring programs to identify problems in implementation and
for promoting coordination among relevant actors to exploit potential synergy from related
activities. In terms of accountability, there is a program performance monitoring system in
place (the SIG) and outcomes are reported to the Ministry of Planning, where a team of 40
professionals is using an evaluation framework developed by the Govemnnent to assess each
of the 388 PPA programs and report to the President by the end of March 2001. The
assessment is to be used to adjust PPA implementation and determine proposed priorities
under the next draft LDO to be submitted to Congress on April 30 2001. The Government
also plans to review its general program evaluation framework during 2001 with Bank
cooperation under the possible technical assistance loan. To further promote transparency
and accountability, the SIG is available on the internet, with the name and phone number of
each manager included, in addition to budget execution and performance data.
Box 4: PPA Snapshot: Program Variables
The PPA's 388 programs cover all activities of government, with 87 programs considered strategic.
Programs vary considerably in nature.
Variables includedfor each program are:
Performance Indicators
* Baseline (current trendline)
* Targets for 2003
Type of program:
*  finalistico (product or service with direct benefits to citizens)
*   nao-finalistico (product or service with no direct benefits to citizens, such as administrative costs)
*   other (no product or service, e.g. debt service)
Time horizon:
*   Continuous
*   Time-limited
Financing: (multiple sources possible)
* By source: Federal, State, Municipal, public enterprise, external source, private sector
* By type: current, capital
For each action within a program, financing sources are specified, plus:
Mode of implementation: (each activity within a program may be different)
*  Direct Federal
*   Decentralized (to States or Municipalities)
*   Line of Credit (financing)
Responsible Unit for carrying out activity:
*  Departnent within a Ministry
*   State
* Municipality
Private sector
47.    In sum, the chief accomplishments of Avan a Brasil thus far include:
* a valuable diagnosis of development needs (the Eixos study) discussed above;



19
* a move from input-based budgeting to a focus on objectives (through indication of physical
actions and 2003 physical targets to each program);
* introduction of a management arrangement to encourage coordination and an MIS to assist in
manager reporting and program visibility.
* introduction of an initial general evaluation system that includes monitoring of program
implementation, including program management issues; and
* increased transparency of the budget (through physical indicators of actions and objectives
and a consistent coding of the budget).
Box 5: PPA Snapshot: Complexity
A sample of 11 PPA programs from 5 Ministries shows the following characteristics:
* Average 4-year (2000-2003) total funding of 3 billion Reais
* 4-year total program funding ranges from a high of 12.8 billion Reais to a low of 59 million Reais
. Average of 4 different funding sources per program
.  Number of finding sources per program ranges from a high of 7 sources to a low of 2 sources
* Average of 15 actions per program,
. Number of actions per program ranging from a high of 36 actions to low of 4 actions per program
. Average program spans 2 Ministries
Program span across Ministries ranges from a high of 4 Ministries to a low of I .Ministry
48.   The Government is now aiming to consolidate the new PPA approach. The two key
strategic challenges for 2000-01 are:
A.    Effectively inte2rate plannin2 and budaetin2 through: better coordination between the
planning and budget offices in each ministry, and between the Ministry of Planning and Ministry
of Finance (Treasury) on annual spending allocations; full-cost allocation to programs to allow
better resource allocation decisions; improved linkages between the financial management
system (SIAFI) and planning (SIG); and
B.    Improve technical efficiency in the delivery of programs through better arrangements
for managerial and ministerial action; these arrangements could include closer involvement of
line ministries in determining targets and costs and should achieve a closer match between the
authority and accountability of program managers.
Achieving both of these strategic objectives will require actions to improve evaluation, through
the following actions:
* assess progress in the prescribed targets (first round of program monitoring): assessment
of progress is part of the general monitoring/evaluation activities underway covering all
programs;
* use of the first evaluation results making decisions for the 2002 LDO and budget. The
evaluation is presently being completed. The evaluation report will be delivered to Congress
together with the draft LDO on April 30, 2001;



20
*  introduce deeper program  evaluations of selected programs, with involvement at the
ministerial level and including (i) a model of how government actions influence the outcome
of interest (i.e., disentangling the effect of government actions from serial trends in the
performance indicators) and (ii) better estimates of the full costs required to achieve the
outcomes. These evaluations are likely to begin in 2002.
*  Further develop the general monitoring and evaluation system, including a system  to
protect priority programs, particularly when overall resources decline, to be linked into the
planning and budgeting cycle. This development, which the Government expects to develop
during 2001, is an area that could form part of the technical assistance project currently under
preparation.
49.    A  central government's objective is to improve public sector service delivery to
Brazilian citizens. At the broadest, macro level, fiscal planning through the LFR is expected to
continue delivering the improved macroeconomic stability that Brazilians have been enjoying
during the last five years. At the allocational level, the PPA goals are expected to better match
Brazilian citizens' expectations of the kinds of services to be provided by the public sector. And
at the technical efficiency level, PPA administration seeks to maximize the "bang for the buck"
in terms of the goals that have been set to be achieved. The Government's concern with
delivering services to its citizens is manifest in four mutually related additional PPA programs:
(i) to increase service quality [the Quality Program (Qualidade no Servi,o Publico), one of the
388 PPA programs) through better management techniques and improved recognition to good
civil service teams'9; (ii) to reduce bureaucratic weight through a new program to simplify
administrative procedures (Programa Nacional de Desburocratiza,do) that has already produced
420 simplification measures, with 248 of those with results on the ground (i.e., facilitating the
citizen's dealings with the government; (iii) to improve the performance of public agencies
through a results oriented Public Management Program (Programa Gestdo Public
Empreendedora); (iv) to improve civil service capacity for results oriented public management
(Programa Valorizafao do Servidor PNblico). In addition, service delivery is being encouraged
by dismissal of public servants that have engaged in poor behaviors (corruption, poor treatment
of the public, disruption at work), with federal dismissals increasing from 307 in 1996 to 454 in
1999) and by the Rede Governo, a web page (1500 hits per day at present) providing information
links to the public on public services and public service providers20.
50.   Delivering better services to citizens means, in particular, better public services to the
poor. A major part of public expenditures are allocated to health, education and other social
services, which largely benefit the poor. Therefore the PPA, both as a process that improves the
use of resources and as specific programs that benefit the poor may become a key lever for
public action to reduce poverty.
51.    The reforms of the PPA process are a key component of the set of reforms that would be
supported by the proposed PFRSAL and follow up loan(s). The first loan would support the

teams out of 75 candidate teams, will be recognized.
20 The Govermnent intends to further unify and extend systems of information to the public through, among other
actions, a new "citizen's card" to access information services, a unified "call center", an office at the Presidency that
will hear complaints and suggestions, 250.000 new points of electronic access, electronic procurement, and
electronic tax payments.



21
actions that have already been undertaken (summarized in para. 47). The next loan(s) would
support the actions to be completed during 2001-02 (para. 48), specifically a revision of the
Government's monitoring and evaluation system and the integration of planning and evaluation
to the budget through this system and through the LDO.
52.   Reduction of Personnel Expenditures. Another policy to improve the allocation of
public expenditures has been to encourage a reduction in the burden of personnel expenditures,
including ceilings on the share of those expenditures in total revenues. These expenditures are
comprised by wages to the active civil service as well as by benefits to retirees. In several cases,
personnel expenditures have exceeded 80% of net revenues, with a few cases where the revenues
did not suffice to cover personnel costs. Excessive government expenditures has responded
partly to excessive wages in some parts of the civil service, excessive employment in many
areas, and a generous retirement benefit regime.
53.   The Fiscal and Administrative Reform Loan approved last March supported the actions to
allow governments to reduce personnel expenditures.21 These actions included passage of the
19th Amendment to the Constitution, which removed mandatory tenure for the civil service and
established conditions under which governments would be allowed to implement redundancy
programs as well as the process to implement those programs. Furthermore, the Fiscal
Responsibility Law includes a related provision that sets ceilings to the share of personnel
expenditures in net revenues and to the distribution of those shares among the legislative,
judiciary, and executive branches of an individual government (para. 26). Ceilings on the total
shares of personnel expenditures, which had been enacted in previous laws, and a stronger
budget constraint led sub-national governments to reduce the share of personnel expenditures
chiefly by containing the growth of personnel expenditures while revenues increase (para. 26).
The ceilings provide a necessary constraint where there are strong pressures to raise employment
and wages. Pending legislation (the Inadequate Performance Dismissal Bill) that will determine
conditions for dismissal of government employees by reason of poor performance, as well as the
set of careers in the civil service that are subject to the redundancy provisions will provide
governments with an additional tool of adjustment under conditions of excessive personnel
expenditures (i.e., when the share of those expenditures exceeds the limits established in the
LFR. The second or third loan of the proposed program of Bank support would support approval
of this pending legislation.
54.   Systems for Monitoring Expenditures. Brazil's Integrated Financial Management
Systems (IFMS). A fundamental requirement to achieve fiscal efficiency is that the budget
reflect strategic priorities and expenditures be made and tracked accordingly. Asset and liability
management is also an important component for the achievement of fiscal efficiency. Effective
monitoring and evaluation of expenditures, assets and liabilities, are key components of efficient
fiscal policies and operations. The planning and management of government programs on a
multiyear basis, such as intended by the Brazilian PPA, further supports the achievement of
targeted budgetary outputs and outcomes. IFMS facilitates the administration of the relevant
information flows, tracking revenues and expenses, and providing managers with comprehensive
information on the financial and physical execution of the budget required for planning, decision
making and evaluation.
21 Two prior Bank operations have supported social security reforms to contain the impact of the generous
retirement benefits of the civil service, which are constitutionally protected.



22
55.   In 1987, Brazil's federal government established an IFMS, known as SIAFI. The system
was placed under the responsibility of the Natural Treasury Secretariat (STN) at the Ministry of
Finance (MOF). Through an extensive telecommunications network, SIAFI outreaches to
approximately 4,650 spending units under the federal government's and the social security
budgets. It is also used for the consolidation of the financial statements of the federal, state and
municipal governments, to produce the consolidated financial statements of the Union. Through
SIAFI, the SNT performs the financial planning of the federal budget; centrally processes and
records all budgetary and financial transactions of spending units, thus effectively controlling
the execution of the budget and automatically making the accounting postings thereon,
producing the federal government's financial statements and financial reports required at the
various government management levels; and, concentrates all federal government cash revenues
in the treasury's unified account (Conta Unica do Tesouro) held at the Central Bank, and
centralizes payments made on behalf of spending units during budget execution. SIAFI offers
government managers consultation and reporting facilities, providing access to current and past
fiscal year data bases, and permits the importation of data to other management applications.
56.   While SIAFI remains a sound operating IT system, it is in urgent need of technological
upgrading after 13 years in operation.  It was originally developed using programming
methodologies and languages that have been largely surpassed and its internal architecture
permits user access only by way of terminals, disallowing the use of Windows and other graphic
environment facilities. Its data base technology has also been overcome not having the
flexibility and agility offered by a new generation of graphic environment data base versions for
the expedient customization SIAFI's functionality pursuant changes in financial management
legislation, policies and processes. This is particularly important in terms of new functional
requirements related to the PPA and the LRF.
57.   To address these and other relevant technological and functional issues, the government
has designed the SIAFI 21st Century project, aiming at replacing the current SIAFI with a new
system using the latest technological advances, improving its current budget, cash management
and accounting capabilities, and accommodating its functionality to the new fiscal management
framework defined by the PPA, the LRF and emphasis on asset/liability management. The
project calls for important enhancements in the system's architecture, establishing a three-layer
structure (data/ applications/user interface) which will greatly facilitate the future adaptation of
the system to technological and functional changes, and that will offer user-friendly
environments and data retrieval and analysis tools so that the systems becomes a real managerial
system, rather than remain mainly an operations and financial recording facility.
58.   The new system will be structured in four basic subsystems. The budget, financial and
patrimonial subsystem would perform most budgetary and cash management functions of the
current SIAFI, with enhanced financial planning capabilities and with added functionality
serving the information requirements of the PPA and the LRF. A second subsystem will focus
on asset/liability administration, with capability to handle the information flows and the
management requirements of an assets portfolio amounting to approximately US$185 billion,
and a liabilities portfolio, including internal and external debt obligations, amounting to
approximately US$335 billion.  A new and third subsystem  will serve the monitoring
requirements established by the LRF for the federal and particularly for the state and municipal
governments, including the management of constitutional and voluntary transfers made by the
federal level to local governments. A fourth subsystem is intended to modernize the internal



23
management of the STN, implementing work flow and other technological systems to improve
operational efficiency and controls.
59.   While some project preparation progress was made during 2000, the program will be
largely developed between 2001 and 2002. Development of the budget, financial and patrimonial
subsystem is likely to be completed in the 2nd quarter of 2001, with completion of the other
modules expected by the 2nd quarter of 2002. It is planned to be fully operational at the
beginning of 2003. However, a number of modules required for the preparation and planning of
the 2003 budget are scheduled to come.
60.   With these improvements the Government will be better equipped to a key requirement
of good public sector performance: output and outcomes oriented execution of the budget; close
monitoring of revenues and expenditures; efficient asset/liability management; and, strong fiscal
management evaluation capabilities. This approach is consistent with the new PPA/LFR
framework, which call for improved integration between planning, budgeting and spending.
61.   As indicated, the Government has begun to implement parts of this reform. The second
or third operation under the proposed program, would support (i) completed improvements in
the budget and patrimonial sub-system, with completion measured as effective use by
government spending units, and (ii) progress towards complethig the other module within the
timetable referred to in para. 59.
EFFICIENCY OF DEBT MANAGEMENT
62.   Debt management is a fundamental determinant of macroeconomic vulnerability and of
fiscal performance. Interest payments on the public debt turned Brazil's primary surplus of 4.3%
of GDP into a nominal deficit of 3.4% of GDP, thereby accounting for 7.7% of GDP from
January to September of 2000. While a primary surplus can offset the burden of interest
payments to generate a sustainable debt path, efficient debt management can reduce the primary
effort required through a choice of a debt portfolio structure that mitigates the risk component of
interest rates faced by the public sector. The following paragraphs describe recent debt trends,
debt policies, and debt institutions in Brazil, as well as the recent institutional reforms that are
bringing debt management closer to international practice.
63.   Growth of Government Debt. Brazil's net public sector debt grew very rapidly from
28.5 percent of GDP in 1995 to 53.4 percent in January 1999, raising doubts about the
sustainability of economic policy and on the country's capacity for proper debt management.
These concerns were compounded by the short maturity of the domestic public debt, and a
rapidly changing operating environment characterized by increased reliance on market sources
for financing, greater exposure to financial risks resulting from financial liberalization, and larger
international capital flows. The urgency of the situation was indicated by the international
attention paid to Brazil's debt structure as a source of vulnerability in late 1998, and by the
decision to shift from exchange rate targeting to inflation targeting in the first half of 1999.
Moreover, the period since March 1999 has been characterized by a rapid evolution in debt
policies to take advantage of the new monetary policy environment.
64.   Composition of Domestic Debt. As of September 2000, the net public sector debt of R$
548 billion (or 48.5% of GDP was comprised of federal net debt (29.4% of GDP), sub-national



24
net debt (16.7%, mostly state governments), and the debt of state-owned enterprises (2.4%,
mostly state enterprises). Net internal debt constituted 39.0% of GDP, while net external debt
was 9.5%. Over time, the share of net public sector domestic debt relative to net external debt
has increased. Domestic debt comprised 66 percent of total debt in January 1997, but increased
to 78 percent in December 1998. Despite the devaluation in January 1999, the relative shares, as
of June 2000, have remained at this level. Gross federal securities outstanding in the domestic
market in June 2000, excluding Treasury securities held by the Central Bank, amounted to
R$511.9 billion or 45.3 percent of GDP. The total stock of federal securities has increased
substantially since 1993, reflecting increased financing costs due to higher interest rates,
recognition of debts, and recapitalization of state-owned banks.
65.   Government Debt Policies. Since achieving price stability in 1994, the Treasury
authorities' medium-term objective has been to increase the maturity and duration of the liability
portfolio by increasing the share of fixed-coupon securities22. Nevertheless, the speculative
attack of October 1997 compelled the Central Bank to raise interest rates substantially, thereby
imposing a capital loss on the holders of longer-maturity fixed-rate debt and consequently
reducing demand for these securities. After a brief period of issuing floating rate instruments at
the end of 1997, the Treasury was able to resume the issuance of fixed-rate securities as domestic
interest rates returned to the pre-crisis level in the first quarter of 1998, but the Russian crisis in
August 1998 again provoked an speculative attack, resulting in a return to high interest rates. In
response to these various shocks, the share of fixed-rate instruments declined from 55.6 percent
in May 1998 to 3.5 percent of federal securities in the market in December 1998, while floating
rate instruments increased to 69.1% and dollar-indexed instruments rose to 21% by the same
date. The January 1999 devaluation pushed the latter share to 30.4 percent in January 1999. The
drastic changes in the compositions of the instruments had a substantial effect on the duration of
the portfolio, increasing its exposure interest rate risks. However, the refinancing risk did not
increase in similar proportions because the Treasury extended the average maturity of the
portfolio using long-term floaters ( 3 and 5 years). By September 2000, the debt structure had
improved significantly, with the share placed at fixed rates recovering to 15.7%; the share placed
at floating rates declining to 53.2%; and the share of dollar indexed debt declining to 20.5%,.
66.   On the external front, the long period of debt negotiation with the commercial banks and
the Paris Club concluded in 1993, resulting in the issuance of Brady bonds and opening a new
era of relationship with the commercial sources. Since then the government has actively
increased the share of financing from external sources relative to domestic sources. However, the
government's external debt policy has not been driven so much by its financing needs, but rather
by the need to issue the minimum required to establish a yield curve in international markets and
thereby facilitate the access of private issuers to these markets. Like other Latin borrowers, it has
also been involved in the restructuring of its Brady debt.
67.   Institutional and Leaal Framework The Central Bank was the main institution that
managed the public external debt in Brazil up until the period between 1986 and 1998 when the
transfer of debt management responsibilities from the Central Bank to the Treasury began with
the establishment of the STN within the Treasury. Under the new arrangement, the STN was to
be responsible for the administration of both internal and external debt. The Treasury is
22 The Government's letter of Development Policies (Annex 1) provides a more detailed statement of debt policy
objectives, which are listed in para. 70.



25
therefore legally responsible for making the ultimate decisions regarding the issuance, issue size,
maturity, timing and characteristics of the Treasury securities. Nevertheless, the Central Bank
remained an important issuer of federal securities in the domestic market due to its monetary
policy objectives and continued to influence the administration of the public debt. Furthermore,
the Central Bank continues to manage the government's access to the international capital
market and the dialogue with the lenders involved in the Brady bonds and Paris Club
negotiations because of the complexity and sensitivity of the issues at stake and the existent
capacity in the Central Bank.
68.   This institutional dispersion is further complicated by the involvement of several
government agencies in the management of the multilateral debt. Currently the Treasury has only
a marginal involvement in deciding on the size of the contracts with multilateral banks.
Decisions in this regard are mainly driven by the Ministry of Planning and COFIEX,
independent of a financial assessment of the overall debt management policy (although the
Treasury is represented in COFIEX). At the operational level, each of the Ministries acting as
implementing agencies are responsible for budgeting, accounting and payment of these loans,
thus multiplying the number of back offices involved in the management of this debt. Dispersion
is also reflected in the legal framework, which lacks unification of the various debt provisions
into a comprehensive code. Existing provisions also lack a clear definition of objectives for debt
management, although there are implicit references to some of these objectives.
69.   Reform of Debt Management Institutions. The Government is presently undertaking a
reform of its debt management institutions. In addition to continued actions to transfer the debt
management functions to the Treasury, the latter is upgrading its organizational and professional
capacity to manage the debt. These changes will allow the Government to better address debt
management challenges. These challenges include a desirable move towards a more even
distribution of maturities (e.g., by issuing medium and long term floating rate bonds and/or
replacing discounted bullet bonds by coupon amortization bonds) and increasing the use of
fixed-rate instruments. A good balance in the use of available instruments should allow Brazil to
minimize the volatility of the real interest rate paid on the debt, the parameter which, together
with the primary deficit, directly affects debt dynamics.
70.   The Government has already undertaken the following actions to improve debt
management institutions:
*  decided to centralize debt management at the treasury (through a formal agreement between
the Federal Government and the Central Bank): this aims to strengthen the governance
framework, which should clearly indicate the authority that borrows and issues new debt,
invests, and undertakes transactions on the government's behalf. This governance practice is
an important component of sovereign debt management, given the size of government debt
portfolios.
*  created analytical middle office at the Treasury23: this aims to provides the research,
analysis, decision support, information and planning activities that are necessary and useful
to senior management and to the portfolio decision makers (see Box 6);
23 In debt management parlance, the front office is the point of contact with the markets; the middle office monitors
information, evaluates performance, and formulates policy options; and the back office implements transactions
(e.g., settlement).



26
*  created unified back office within the treasury;
*  created unit to assess and quantify contingent liabilities;
*  introduced a risk management framework (Asset Liability Management), with preliminary
debt risk analysis completed and initial balance sheet produced;
*  improved primary and secondary markets of government securities: improvements included
pre-announcement of auctions, fungible issues, phasing out of Central Bank primary
issuance, and promotion of market           Box 6: Possible Tasks for a Middle Office

24 A code of conduct which provides guidance on matters such as personal portfolios, acceptance of gifts and
representation can similarly encourage behavior standards which can complement the above activities in ensuring
prudent management of the government debt. One of the most critical responsibilities of the head of the debt office
is to enforce proper ethical standards and foster a strong risk management culture. Currently, a draft of a code of
conduct for the Treasury has been prepared which addresses many of these issues. The draft has been submitted to
the legal council within the National Treasury, and subsequently will be submitted to the Minister of Finance for his
approval.
25 In this regard, the Government prepared a draft of a management and operations guideline (currently being
reviewed by the Ministry of Planning) which defines functions and responsibilities within the National Treasury,
and particularly for the Debt Office. The guideline also defines the interrelationship among the various offices

(para. 23).
* Legal and organizational framework: Selected key issues with regard to the legal framework
are (i) clearer definition of debt management objectives; (ii) centralization of authority to
issue new debt complemented by mechanisms which prevent the potential over-issuance of
debt; (iii) regulations concerning trading of options and derivatives in the domestic market.
the key requirement regard to the organizational framework is to ensure that it be clearly
specified, that there be coordination and s aring of information, and that the mandates of the
respective players be clear.                       Box 7: Strategic Benchmarks

73.   Improved institutions will allow Brazil's federal government to better manage the risks
and returns of its assets and liabilities, as follows: (i) better governance through centralization at
the treasury will strengthen accountability and the focus on risk/cost objectives; (ii) written
guidelines and procedures and a code of conduct will improve overall performance and also
strengthen accountability; (iii) a stronger rniddle office will achieve the needed capacity to
analyze and formulate policy options; (iv) secondary market improvements and stronger back
and front offices will facilitate the implementation of chosen debt policies. The second or third
loan wouldfollow progress in the areas indicated in para. 71. Specifically, key actions regarding
governance (transfer of external debt operations to the Treasury and issuance of the code of
conduct and debt management guidelines and procedures), capacity (issuance of regular middle
office reports on the debt portfolio and STN operations and completion of an IT development
plan), and benchmark (annual borrowing plan, initial benchmark and medium term strategy)
would be completed prior to the second or third loan.
EXPECTED IMPACTS OF THE REFORM PROGRAM
74.   The overall goal of the program is to strengthen the foundations for Brazil's performance
on growth, poverty reduction and public service delivery to citizens. The direct goals of the
government's reform program can be stated as follows:
* improving fiscal sustainability, including the pursuit of a low cost of the public debt within
acceptable risk levels;
* improving the allocational and technical efficiency of expenditures, including an
improvement in the delivery of public services to Brazil's citizens.
All of the four key components discussed above (the LFR, the PPA, the SIAFI 21st century, and
debt management) have a bearing on one or both of these two broad goals. Implementation of the
LFR institutionalizes and deepens fiscal adjustment and provides an aggregate framework for the
allocation of public resources. The PPA provides a stronger programmatic orientation to the
budget which should contribute to aggregate sustainability by improving the efficiency of public
expenditures and the extent to which these expenditures meet the needs of Brazil's citizens. The
reform of the government's integrated financial management system improves budget
programming, budget execution and debt management, all with a bearing on fiscal sustainability
and the allocation of expenditures. And better debt management is aimed at minimizing debt
costs for given risk levels, with an impact on fiscal sustainability. As indicated (para. 12), the
program is expected to contribute to poverty reduction objectives through higher growth and
better direct poverty reduction programs.
75.   The Law  of Fiscal Responsibility. Analytically, the LFR provides a number of
incentives for fiscal prudence. These are:
* A framework for ex-ante constraints: this includes the fiscal targets (on revenues,
expenditures, the primary deficit and debt) that governments must issue with their budget
guidelines laws;



29
*  A framework to plan on fiscal risks: this is provided by the Annex of Fiscal Risks that
governments must issue with their budget guidelines laws.
*  A framework for ex-post reconciliation and corrective action: this is the obligation to report
on fiscal performance, compare it with fiscal targets, and take corrective actions;
*  numerical limits on "permanent" expenditures and on personnel expenditures (the most
important of current expenditures): these are the constraints that personnel expenditure/net
revenue ratios not exceed numerical limits (para. 26) and the constraint that charges
permanent expenditures (legally mandatory expenditures for more than two years) not exceed
charges permanent revenues;
*  A stronger framework for numerical limits or debt: these are constraints on the ratio of debt
to net revenues that are issued by the Senate on debt and constraints on borrowing LFR;
*  increased transparency of fiscal planning and fiscal performance increased transparency is
triggered by the obligation to disseminate PPA and budget laws; governments' reports on
budget execution and budget management; and public accounts.
76.   Compliance with LFR is encouraged by present budget constraints (debt and borrowing),
by LFR provisions prohibiting certain voluntary transfers and borrowing to non-complying
governments, and by penal provisions established by the new Law of Fiscal Crimes.
77.   The impact of the LFR should be analyzed in the context of the other government
policies with a bearing on fiscal sustainability. These reforms include the Government's 1998
Fiscal Stability Plan, which runs through 2001 and contemplates measures to generate fiscal
surpluses that suffice to reduce the overall public sector's debt/revenue ratio; the refinancing
agreements with most states and some municipalities, which strengthened the budget constraints
faced by sub-national governments; and social security and administrative reforms, which are
helping contain personnel expenditures.
78.   The LFR was issued in May 2000. Given the mechanics of the law, its effects began with
the Federal Government's issuance of its 2001 Fiscal Guidelines Law in July 2000, which
included the Fiscal and Risk Annexes mandated by the LFR The federal fiscal annex presents
federal primary surplus targets that decline from 2.6% of GDP in 2001 to 1.8% of GDP in 2003.
The net debt targets decline from 28.0 percent of GDP in 2001 to 25% of GDP in 2003. The
fiscal risks annex indicates R$13 billion of old liabilities to be recognized during 2001. The
federal LDO illustrates the establishment of ex-ante constraints on fiscal behavior, which is
achieved through the LDO legal commitment to meet the targets. Of course, this constraint will
work only if the government that issues the LDO is subject to a strong budget constraint, which
the LFR also contributes to put in place through ceilings on debt and constraints on borrowing
and which was strengthened by the debt-refinancing agreements with most states and some
municipalities by guaranteeing debt service obligations with intergovernmental transfers.

79.   LFR effects are continuing with reporting obligations. Reports, including bimonthly
summary budget execution reports and fiscal management reports (issued every four months),
are beginning to be issued, some appearing in government websites. By April of 2001,
Governments must issue, disclose and disseminate their 2000 fiscal accounts, and the federal
government must consolidate those accounts by mid-year. By April of 2001, governments
(except municipal governments with population less than 50,000), must issue LDOs with 2002
fiscal target annexes and fiscal risk annexes.
80.   Ultimately,   the   joint
effects of the LFR and the other               Chart 1 - Brazil - Ratio of Net Debt to
provisions discussed above can                  Disposable Revenues- Federal and
be summarized in the behavior of               Subnational Governments: 1998-2000

net federal revenues increased   a 1.40
from  1.2 in December 1997 to
about two (i.e., debt twice as        1.20
much as revenues) in January
1999    (when    the    dollar

national revenues increased from
1.5 in December 1997 to 1.8 in August, 1999. Then, as a result of the 1998 federal Fiscal
Stability Plan (which was strengthened following the early  1999 devaluation), the debt
refinancing agreements, and other provisions limiting sub-national access to borrowing,
debt/revenue trends changed course, with some decline in the federal debt/revenue ratio from the
high point in mid-1999 and a stabilization of the sub-national debt/revenue ratio within 1.7-1.8
after August 1999. The LFR is expected to reinforce this change of course as it enters into full
operation after approval in May 1999. For example, in the Annex of Fiscal Targets to the LDO
for the 2001 budget, the federal government aims at reducing the ratio of federal debt to GDP to
28.0%, 26.3%, and 25.1 respectively in 2001-03, from 30.1% in October 2000. It federal
revenues rise at least at the same rate as GDP, federal debt/revenue ratios will also decline.
Furthermore, most sub-national debt is covered by refinancing agreements which have declining
debt/revenue targets. These should be reinforced by the LFR as it enters into full operation.
27 Debt ceilings under the LFR are to be expressed as ratios to net revenues rather than as ratios to GDP (Para. 3 of
LFR Article 30).

81.   The Multi-Annual Plan. By meeting the challenges indicated in para. 48., Brazil's PPA
process will be part of a medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) that will have a positive
effect on all three outcomes that are expected to result from such a framework: aggregate fiscal
discipline, allocation of resources in accordance with strategic priorities, and technical
efficiency. The MTEF in Brazil is comprised by the LFR, which furnishes the overall resource
envelope, and by the budget cycle (PPA,LDO, budget Law), where priorities are defined and
implemented. The tools to achieve these goals are program budgeting; performance budgeting;
program evaluation; introduction of program managers and improving program coordination;
serving as a vehicle for strategic allocation of resources; establishing a multi-year planning
horizon, within a multi-year expenditure envelope. While the ultimate effect of these reforms is
highly dependent on the unique institutional and political environment in each country, and
measuring the precise impact is practically impossible given the nature of fiscal reform
programs, based on the general experience in other countries with some components of the PPA
reform, it is likely that decision-making, resource allocations, and technical efficiency of
spending will be positively effected by the reforms.
Improved Aggregate Fiscal performance at all Government levels
82.   Stronger aggregate fiscal discipline will be supported by a consistent and realistic
resource framework (which is now being provided by better fiscal planning under the Fiscal
Responsibility Law), undertaking specific budget commitments only within the available multi-
year resource envelope, and by  defining expenditure priorities (which should assist in
expenditure reductions when budget reductions are necessary). Better aggregate fiscal planning
will also increase the predictability of both policy and funding so that programs can be planned
ahead and be sustained. While there is some potential for PPA to increase demand for public
resources, the over-all impact is likely to be a positive reinforcement of fiscal discipline.
Moreover, if PPA improves the effectiveness and efficiency (intensiveness of use) of public
resources, more can be achieved within current public resource levels, which may serve to lower
demand for additional resources or allow reallocation of resources to higher priorities.
Improved Allocation and Technical Efficiency of Expenditures
83.   The PPA introduces several reforms that provide more objective information on what
public spending purchases and what is achieved, which can improve decision-making and
resource allocation. Allocation of resources in accordance with strategic priorities will be
positively affected by the PPA process itself, which defines strategic programs, their targets, and
the actions to achieve those targets. Technical efficiency, or efficient and effective use of
resources in the implementation of strategic priorities, will be positively affected by introduction
of a managerial system that mobilizes the allocated resources in an effective way, and improved
coordination of programs which cut across sectors but impact the same objective (e.g., good
water for better health outcomes). To achieve the full benefit of the program manager concept
may require a stronger institutional role for program managers in their interaction with the
expenditure executing ministries, and possibly increased administrative flexibility for line
agencies. Other PPA measures jointly improve allocation and technical efficiency:
* performance measures and increases accountability, which allows better resource allocation
as well as pressure for improved efficiency and effectiveness;



32
* program evaluations, which can improve decision-making and resource allocations, as well
as improve effectiveness and efficiency of programs; serves as a vehicle for selecting
strategic programs, and improving resource allocations. An important challenge here is to
introduce an evaluation system that will yield objective information on the effectiveness of
programs, and then incorporate this information into improved program management and
resource allocations.
Over-all, these reforms are likely to have a positive impact on resource allocation and technical
efficiency, in themselves as well as a package of reforms. Nevertheless, it should be
acknowledged that the PPA is not a guarantee of good public expenditure performance. Future
evaluations are likely to uncover programs that perform poorly. The PPA is expected o provide a
framework to uncover these programs and improve their performance. Hence, the proposed loan
supports the PPA fundamentally as a process, and not as an endorsement of all public
expenditure programs.
84.   The Integrated Financial Management System. The ultimate benefits of the SIAFI
21"t Century project are really the benefits of the other key reforms of the Government's reform
program. The SIAFI 21st Century Project aims at adapting the functionality of the existing
SIAFI to the new financial management model of the federal government, which establishes
program-based multi-annual planning (PPA) framework, and calls for more operational
integration between  planning, budgeting, treasury, debt management and asset/liability
management (as required by the implementation of the LFR). This replaces the historical
bureaucratic public administration model with a management model supporting productivity and
results. Therefore, the SIAFI 215t project is an integral component of the Governments fiscal
reform program.
85.   As an integral component of the reform program, SIAFI 21St Century will provide the IT
framework to enable LFR benefits (overall fiscal balance), PPA benefits (chiefly better
allocation and more effective use of public resources), and debt management benefits (better debt
cost/risk outcomes) to materialize. In these regards, the project will incorporate new management
approaches and techniques that are conceptually absent in the current SIAFI, including program-
based multi-annual planning; monitoring and evaluation of the physical and financial execution
of the budget from a results-oriented management perspective rather than only from an
accounting perspective; costing of government outputs and outcomes, enhanced public debt and
asset/liability management; and, improved accountability at the federal and local government
levels.
86.   The benefits indicated above will be provided through improvements in (i) technology,
(ii) management culture and practice, (iii) legal, policy and institutional framework; and, (iv)
linkage and interaction with other systems. The following paragraphs discusses these
improvements.
Technological benefits and impact
87.   The proposed SIAFI 21't Century project will have four major technological benefits
and impacts: (a) it will neutralize the serious risks implied in the growing obsolescense of the
current SIAFI, which may cause not only technological breakdowns and high maintenance costs,
but also related potential breakdowns of a fiscal management system largely reliant on IT



33
operational support; (b) the new technology will increase the operating efficiency of the IT and
telecommunications platforms; (c) the new technology will greatly facilitate adaptation of the
system to new legal and operating requirements, as well as the addition and integration of new
financial management functions; and, (d) linkage with other more modern government systems,
such as SIDOR and SIG will be greatly enhanced.
Impact on management culture and practice
88.   The passage from a system developed in aging programming languages and character
mode technology to a system developed for a Windows environment with strong graphic
capabilities will no doubt have a major positive impact in operations at large and in
management efficiency and effectiveness, making the retrieval and handling of information
much more friendly, faster, flexible, agile and efficient. It will permit to transform SIAFI into a
true managerial system, rather than remaining mostly an information processing and storage
system. The new environment will facilitate the integration of peripheral software to support
additional management functions at a level that not even the managerial version of SIAFI, tied to
a less flexible operating environment, can achieve today. Customization functions allowed by
the new technology will permit managers to adapt the system's outputs to their specific
information needs, which should also have an important positive impact con management culture
and practice.
Legal, policy and institutional framework
89.   As the design and development of the SIAFI 21st CENTURY application will include
functionalities directly related to PPA, LRF, asset liability/management, local government
monitoring and STN operations, it will have very positive impact on the implementation of the
relative legal and policy frameworks, as well as on institutional arrangements thereon, both as a
source of customized information and as a management tool.
Linkage with other systems
90.   A number of key government systems, including SIDOR and SIG were developed several
years after the original development of SIAFI, thus using more modem technology. This results
in limitations for the exchange of information and reduces the potential and the scope of
operating integration of the government's financial management systems.  The technological
and functional upgrading proposed under the SIAFI 21St Century project will not only facilitate
the development of more flexible, agile and efficient links, but provides the opportunity to
incorporate many such links into the new system's design, in particular in what relates to more
integration to SIDOR and SIG, which with SIAFI are the cornerstones of the Brazilian new
financial management system. It will also improve the support to SFC fiscalization and audit
activities. Navigation in the new SIAFI system for purposes such as internal and external audit as
well as to provide information to the general public as part of public sector transparency
initiatives, will also be greatly facilitated.
91.   Debt Manazement. The proposed improvements to the debt management practice in
Brazil will have an impact on the following dimensions of cost, risk, and efficiency:



34
Improved sovereign debt management will reduce the vulnerability of the debt portfolio to
financial risks, which include exchange rate and interest rate risks. The potential sources of
these risks are potentially both internal and external to the economy. Recent developments in
the monetary policy area, such as the shift from exchange rate targeting to inflation rate
targeting in the first half of 1999, and the large share of floating rate and dollar indexed
instruments have increased the vulnerability of the public debt to these financial risks. Public
debt management based on an optimal balance sheet approach which focuses on the
sovereign's risk/return tradeoff would provide the appropriate framework for risk
management under these circumstances.
* The proposed improvements to Brazil's debt management practice would also improve the
level of predictability to debt service, which is one of the major expenditure components of
the budget, thereby producing significant gains in the efficiency of budget management. The
level of predictability is improved because the desired debt portfolio structure will be defined
in a more systematic way, then a concrete action plan established in order to achieve the set
parameters. This also allows the authorities to make more precise predictions of the impact
of debt service on the budget.
The level of predictability will be further improved by the adaptation of up-to-date modeling
tools, such as stress scenario analysis and Monte-Carlo simulations, which analyzes multiple
scenarios in a very cost efficient way. These techniques allow the modeling of extreme
scenarios, through which Brazilian authorities will be able to predict and therefor prepare for
circumstances under which debt service could become unmanageable.  It is precisely
situations when the debt service becomes unmanageable that can result in a general financial
crisis, leading to sharp declines in growth and increases in poverty, and hence the ability to
predict and prepare for such situations by modeling the effect of different public debt
structures is a crucial component of the present program.
* The proposed improvements in Brazil's debt management practice can also reduce the
funding cost in the medium term by improving the credibility of the issuer. The proposed
improvements are based on the principles of clear set of objectives for managing the
government's debt, a satisfactory cost and risk framework, specific portfolio and risk
management policies, and further centralization of the government debt management
organization. These principles form the basis for sound debt management practice in
developed countries as well as for recent reforms in several countries. They improve Brazil's
credibility as an issuer by reducing uncertainty and increasing transparency of debt
management operations. They assure market participants that the government debt portfolio
is being managed prudently and efficiently, and thus allow reductions to the risk premium,
and hence funding cost, associated with poor management. Funding cost is further reduced
because the proposed upgrade of analytical tools allows the debt authorities to better manage
its funding strategy, therefore allowing them to avoid risk that a disproportionate amount of
data matures and must be refinanced at a time when market interest rates are at a cyclical
peak.
* The proposed debt management reforms improves the governance of the sovereign debt
management, making the delegation more precise and transparent and improving the
accountability of the different participants. The governance framework is grounded in a clear



35
legal framework that clarifies the authority to borrow and to issue new debt, invest, and
undertake transactions on the government's behalf.
The organizational framework for debt management needs to be well specified, and ensure
that mandates and roles are well articulated. Legal arrangements should be supported by
delegation of appropriate authority to debt managers. Experience suggests that there is a
range of institutional alternatives for allocating sovereign debt management functions across
one or more agencies, but regardless of which approach is chosen, the key requirement is to
ensure that the organizational framework surrounding debt management is clearly specified,
there is coordination and sharing of information, and that the mandates of the respective
players are clear.
* The government can reduce the cost and risk of the public debt portfolio over the medium
run by further developing the domestic bond market. This is particularly important for Brazil
given the importance of the domestic debt stock. The proposed development of the domestic
bond market and the consolidation of Brazil's international yield curve results in important
externalities to the whole economy, private as well as other public issuers.  At the
macroeconomic policy level, it reduces the potentially dangerous reliance on foreign
currency denominated debt. Debt service costs over the medium to long term will decrease
through the development of a deep and liquid market. At the more microeconomic level,
development of a domestic debt market increases overall financial stability and improves
fimancial intermediation through greater competition and development of related financial
infrastructure, products, and services. The development of domestic markets and a related
benchmark yield curve facilitates the introduction of new products, including repurchase
agreements (repos), money market instruments, structured finance, and derivatives, that can
improve risk management and financial stability.
SUSTAINABILITY OF THE REFORMS
92.   Fiscal Responsibility Law. The odds that the reforms will remain are good, but better in
some areas than in others. While it is difficult to put a number to the probability that the reforms
not be reversed, it is possible to point to the factors that make this probability higher than 50%.
With regard to the Fiscal Responsibility Law, these factors are quite clear: they include the
country's commitment to low inflation, which requires fiscal sustainability, and the contribution
of the Law to a stronger budget constraint and to an orderly budget process (though the ex-ante
constraint and the ex-post conciliation mechanisms described before), both of which aid fiscal
sustainability. The country's commitment to low inflation is reflected in the political success of
price stabilization through the Plano Real and the sophisticated and widely publicized inflation
targeting framework put in place last year. This framework can be successful only if monetary
financing of the public sector is contained enough to accommodate targeting of stable prices.
This requires a framework that keeps primary balances high enough to avoid unsustainable debt
levels (levels of debt with debt service obligations that will not reasonably be met). The LFR
provides the budget constraint elements and the budget processes to achieve this end.
Sustainability could falter, however, under an scenario of excessive demands for expenditures
(say, exploding retirement benefit obligations) that breaks down the commitment to price
stability and fiscal orderliness. This risk is, as discussed in the next chapter, moderate.



36
93.   Multiannual Planning Framework With regard to the PPA process, the factors that
support sustainability are not as sharp as in the case of the Fiscal Responsibility Law. Fiscal
reform is never as simple as issuing a decree or passing a law. A PPA type of reform is specially
challenging. Organizational and institutional change face enormous hurdles, including
overcoming tradition and habit, and breaking established alliances between Ministry activities,
interest groups, and political parties.
94.   Nevertheless, the probability of the new PPA process going forward are enhanced beyond
chance by (i) the potential benefits of the reforms, (ii) the Government's awareness of the
difficulty of the PPA challenge, (iii) the government's commitment to the reform, and (iv) the
emerging institutionalization of the PPA. The first of these factors was discussed above (paras.
78-80). Those benefits (essentially better allocation and management use of public resources)
are an important incentive to go forward with the PPA approach. On the government's awareness
of the difficulties of implementing a PPA approach, the Ministry of Planning staff leading the
PPA reforms recognize the difficulty of their task, and have tried to take into account some of the
hurdles they face in implementing the reforms. They are under no illusion of the difficulty of
their task. This pragmatism and realism among staff at the Planning Ministry is a positive factor
in assessing the sustainability of reforms.
95.   The Government's commitment to the PPA approach is reflected in the significant
efforts it has invested in advancing the approach and its associated public sector reforms. These
efforts include:
- developing an inventory of all activities in the Government
*  arranging activities by common objectives into programs
*  developing physical performance indicators and targets for each program and activity
3  assigning program managers to each program
*  establishing a training institute for prograrn managers and providing intensive training
*  preparing and submitting the 2001 Budget by program
*  undertaking high-level policy process to identify strategic programs within the budget
3  developing a computerized system for monitoring program execution
*  developing a PPA evaluation survey to feedback from program managers on PPA
This level of effort is indicative of the importance the Government has placed in PPA, and the
likelihood that the Government will press ahead with implementing PPA reforms.
96.   Institutionalization is strengthened by the PPA's constitutional mandate. While the
various reforms, such as performance management, are not Constitutional requirements, the PPA
planning document must be produced. Certainly PPA will remain in place for the foreseeable
future. Given that many of the PPA reforms, such as performance monitoring and program
structure support setting priorities through the PPA process, it is likely that future Governments
would find the reforms useful to keep, as the process it makes it easier for them to set their own
priorities.
97.   Regarding institutionalization of the reforms, given that this is the first year of the PPA's
operation, not too much can be expected. PPA has not become routine practice or accepted
practice among the bureaucracy. Nonetheless, there are some aspects of PPA that indicate a
degree of permanence to the reform. For example:



37
*  The existence of several hundred trained program managers across the Government.
*  The PPA reforms are being lead by a permanent Ministry (Planning) rather than a temporary
task force.
*  The inclusion of the PPA evaluation reform in law (The LFR includes a requirement for
programs to be evaluated).
*  The requirement that an annual report on PPA progress be submitted to Congress, which
supports evaluation and performance management reforms.
98.   On the other hand, having indicated the factors that raise the likelihood of the PPA being
sustained, the potential risks to the sustainability and to the achievement of its full potential
benefits must be acknowledged. These risks are important and are discussed in the risk section
further below (para. 132).
99.   Financial Management System. Once in place, the new SIAFI system can be expected
to have stronger long-term sustainability, as its technological environment will be state-of-the-art
from its very beginning compared to the current SIAFI system which was developed with
technology that at the time was about to complete its expected life cycle. There are three main
types of arguments for this appraisal referring to: (i) technology; (ii) management culture; and
(iii) the legal, policy and institutional framework.
Technological considerations
100.  The proposed distinct three-layer architecture (data base, application and user interface)
of the new system will largely facilitate the introduction of new technologies at each level as
they become available, without a general disruption of the system as a whole, which is a major
problem that the current SIAFI is presently confronting. The proposed use of CASE-based
design and development and a graphic Windows environment will result in an application that
can be easily adapted to future changes in financial management legislation, processes and other
institutional arrangements, in particular if advanced application customization capabilities and
tools are incorporated in its design.
Management culture
101.  From a functional perspective, Brazil has accumulated 13 years of integrated financial
management experience supported in the widespread use of SIAFI by all federal government
spending units. An administrative culture for IT-based financial management culture has been
developed and is firmly established, supporting the expectation that the new SIAFI will be
sustainable as a system.
Legal, policy and institutional framework
102.  The updating of SIAFI is not being proposed solely in response to the growing
technological obsolescence of the current systemr, but principally in order to adapt the system to
major changes that are taking place under Brazil's far reaching fiscal reform program. SIAFI
21st century will specifically address the monitoring and evaluation requirements of the PPA and
the LRF, as well as the introduction of new permanent institutional arrangements for enhanced
public debt management and federal government asset/liability management. The new system
will be one of the major sources of information for program managers under the PPA, and will



38
specifically monitor the federal and local governments' compliance with the fiscal transparency
requirements under the LRF. New institutional arrangements for public debt management and
asset/liability management will be specifically addressed in the new system both from an
information standpoint as well as for operations. Therefore, not being an stand-alone
technological project but being intimately immersed in the framework of major fiscal reform
developments, it is reasonable to expect that SIAFI 21st century will be a sustainable long-range
proposition.
103.  Debt Institutions. A major factor that determines the sustainability of a debt policy is
the structure of the debt portfolio. Traditional debt sustainability frameworks which exclusively
focuses on the relative size of the public debt are inadequate when the composition of the debt
portfolio significantly alters its cost/risk tradeoff. Poorly structured debt has been a factor in
inducing or propagating recent economic crises. Although perhaps they are not the sole cause of
these crises, the maturity structure, interest rate and currency composition, and obligations due to
contingent liabilities of the government's debt portfolio have often contributed to the severity of
the crisis. Excessive focus on possible savings associated with large volumes of short-term debt
seriously exposes the government budgets to changing financial market conditions, including
changes in the country creditworthiness when this debt has to be rolled over.
104.  Greater reliance on the private mnarket for government financing combined with financial
liberalization and globalization have increased the financial vulnerability of public debt
portfolios. Before these sweeping changes in the late 1980s and early 1990s changed the nature
of public debt management, government financing relied largely on the central bank financing
the debt, with the domestic banking industry often acting as a captive market for government
bonds. This relatively static environment changed dramatically as open economies became
increasingly sensitive to changes in international capital flows.
105.  With those previous government financing arrangements no longer sustainable,
governments were forced to increase its reliance on the market for its financing needs, resulting
in complex debt portfolio structures and instruments, and the potential for increased volatility.
As a result, effective government debt management now requires a more comprehensive
framework and new market-oriented skills which allow the public debt managers to adequately
deal with tasks such as risk management and hedging operations which are needed to manage the
increased financial vulnerability.
106.  The traditional institutional settings are inadequate to deal with the new challenges of
debt management, in particular for countries like Brazil with a large stock of debt and complex
portfolio structure. In the past, the institutional setting of most emerging countries were highly
bureaucratic and characterized by a slow decision-making process and often dispersed
organizational arrangements. This was adequate for a relatively static debt funding environment
which relied heavily on the Central Bank and multilateral agencies.
107.  Such institutional arrangements have proven to be inadequate for managing the
government debt portfolio under a market oriented government financing environment where
more complex decisions have to be rapidly made regarding a larger set of interrelated issues. As
a result, the trend has been to centralize and consolidate debt management in order to facilitate
the management of the public debt portfolio from a whole balance sheet perspective, and to
create an independent debt office which expedites its decision-making process by reducing



39
bureaucratic overhead. The capacity of the debt office has been increased as governments have
realized that they need to attract more highly skilled personnel who can execute market analysis
and operations. At the same time, typically the debt management responsibilities of the Central
Banks have been reduced or eliminated so that they can independently pursue monetary policies
without being undermined by fiscal policy. Changes in Brazil's debt management institutions are
consistent with these trends. Centralization of debt management at the Trasury, improved
institutions for accountability, greater capacity for policy formulation and implementation will
all help improve policy outcomes and thereby make the institutional changes sustainable
THE PROPOSED LOAN
LINK TO CAS
108.  The proposed PFRSAL (the first adjustment loan in support of the first phase of the
Program) is within the assistance program covered by the CAS discussed on March 30, 2000
(R2000-25;IFC/R2000-34). The CAS included poverty reduction and fiscal adjustment as
principal objectives, complemented by assistance programs for growth, development
effectiveness and environmental management. Within the context of these objectives, the CAS
anticipated support through programmatic lending in the area of " improvements in fiscal
institutions and public sector management for better fiscal performance and incentives for fiscal
discipline ,28. Furthermore, the proposed PFRSAL, as indicated before, is a follow-up operation
to the Fiscal and Administrative Reform Loan approved last March in that it supports further
fiscal reforms aimed at fiscal sustainability and improved public sector performance. The
proposed PRFSAL would be in the amount of US$757.58 million. The remaining assistance
under the proposed program would be $450-$750 million.
109. The CAS anticipates $1.5 billion in special adjustment lending for 2000-02, of which
$1.0 billion have already been approved and disbursed. The remaining amount of $0.5 billion of
possible special lending was dropped at the Government's request, as the emergency conditions
that justified such assistance have now subsided. The CAS also anticipates $2.0 of adjustment
lending at standard terms. The Government has requested the Bank for an additional $0.5 billion
of adjustment lending at the Bank's standard terms. The next CAS update, to be submitted in
April, 2001, will include this proposal.
PROGRAM OBJECTIVE
110.  Given the background discussed in the previous chapter, the operation described below
would support a program with the following objective: to improve Brazil's aggregate fiscal
performance, and the quality of public expenditures (better allocational and technical efficiency
and better delivery of public services), including the quality of debt service expenditures. This
2S See CAS, March 6, 2000; Report Number 20160-BR, p. 31.



40
objective falls within the CAS objectives of development and implementation of structural
reforms and fiscal improvement. Pursuit of these objectives continues to be urgent to sustain the
gains that Brazil has achieved by reducing inflation and implementing the Government's rigorous
fiscal adjustment programn during 1999-2000.
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
111.  The Program consists of policy actions to improve fiscal performance, public sector
expenditure management, and debt management chiefly through continued implementation of
the Government's primary surplus and debt targets (the Fiscal Stability Program), deepening of
Fiscal Discipline (through the new Fiscal Responsibility Law), a better design of the public
expenditure planning and implementation process (through the new PPA and improved
monitoring of expenditures); and more professional debt management (through better debt
management institutions). The actions are summarized in Annex 2. They are classified into three
of the four areas discussed in the previous chapter (fiscal, expenditure, and debt management.
Tax reform is excluded because it is not expected to materialize within the PFRSAL horizon

improve the federal financial management system (SIAFI). Possible delays into 2002 could also
occur in selected components of the other areas. For example, developing a formal monitoring
and evaluation system for the PPA could take more than year. A proposed strategy is that a
second loan be submitted at that point in time when a critical mass of reforms has been
accomplished. That is, if by December 2001 the anticipated program of actions has not been
fully completed, the completed actions would be supported by a loan below $500 million, with
the size dependent on the progress made. A third loan would support the remaining reforms.
114. The Bank's financial assistance will help Brazil meet its external financing requirements,
while the proposed reform program supports medium-term fiscal adjustment. During the year
2001, Brazil's current account deficit balance is expected to amount to about $24.8 billion, of
which $5.0 billion are expected to come from multilateral institutions. Moreover, the loan will
also help meet the federal government's financing requirement of about R$15 billion in 2001,
and will also help lengthen the term structure of the public sector's debt, which would reduce
vulnerability to financial shocks.
115. The financial assistance provided by the proposed PFRSAL will be complemented by a
TA project that would include four components: (i) assistance in the implementation of the LFR
(e.g., in governments' various obligations under the LFR); (ii) assistance in the implementation
of the PPA (e.g., in methods of program evaluation) (iii) assistance in the proposed development
of the SIAFI 21st century program; and (iv) assistance in the improvement of debt management
institutions. Box 8 provides some details. This project is presently at the preparation stage.
PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AND SUPERVISION
116.  Supervision will review progress of the implementation of proposed program in each of
its four areas. It will focus on (a) the implementation of the reforms; and (b) the outcomes of the
reforms. The review will largely be based on the monitoring indicators and the goals of the
reforms. The reforms and their implementation dimensions have been discussed throughout this
report. The reforms supported by the proposed operation are summarized in Annex 2, together
with the key actions that are expected for the second loan, their intermediate monitoring
indicators (which serve as benchmarks to assess whether to proceed with a 2ndor 3rd loan), and
the goals that the reforms pursue. Table 4 summarizes the indicators and their expected values,
which serve as benchmarks. These indicators and the possible benchmarks have been indicated
by the Government in its Letter of Development Policy (Annex 1), and are explained as
follows:
*  MIacroeconomic Performance: Key indicators are growth, inflation, and the PSBR. The
numbers in Table 4 reflect the Government's expectations of those indicators. One of these -
inflation -has been formalized through the government's inflation targeting framework
introduced last year.
*  Fiscal Stability: The indicators - the public sector's primary balance and net debt - have
been targeted by the government as part of its 1998 Fiscal Stability Program, which runs
through 2001. The Federal Government's primary balance and debt beyond 2001 have been
indicated in the Government's Budget Guidelines Law.
*  Fiscal Planning: (i) Under the LFR, governments (all states and municipalities with
population exceeding 50.000) must include Fiscal Target and Risk annexes in their LDOs for



42
2002 budgets. This is at the heart of the fiscal planning process that provides an ex-ante
constraint on budget programming. The information on LDOs will be useful to assess the
fiscal stance of the public sector. The Government is planning on developing a report
(perhaps with IPEA) with consolidation and analysis of public sector fiscal prospects in
LDOs. Production of this report provides an indicator of progress in fiscal planning of the
overall public sector.
*  Transparency: Under the LFR, (i) governments (from all states and municipalities with
population exceeding 50,000) must disseminate PPAs, LDOs, Budgets, Public Accounts,
budget execution summary reports, and Fiscal Management Reports; (ii) the Federal
Government must create a Registry of Public Sector Debt at STN. This is a challenge, given
existing informational gaps on sub-national debts. Hence creation of the registry is an
important benchmark of progress; (iii) the Federal Government must consolidate public
accounts from all governments. This consolidation will be a major step forward in public
information of public budgets and an indicator of progress in the implementation of the Law.
*  PPA Evaluation System: The Government intends to undertake a review of its program
evaluation procedures (this would be part of the companion TA operation). Indicators of
progress in this undertaking include consultant reports and the revised operational procedures
that result from such a review.
*  Integration of planning/evaluation to budgeting: (i) The Government is undertaking a review
of programs and management, based on reporting by PPA program managers. Production of
this report provides an indicator of PPA program and management assessment, including
PPA management assessment methods. The LDO (2002 budget) adjustment of budget
priorities provides an indication of the bearing of program evaluation on priorities;
* SIAFI 21't Century: The SIAFI upgrading is organized around four modules (budget,
financial, patrimonial, STN), during a 2001-02 horizon. An indicator of progress is given by
effective use of the completed modules by government spending units.
*  Administrative Reform: The indicator is approval of the Inadequate Performance Dismissal
Bill, the last pending piece of legislation required to make administrative reform operational.
*  Debt Management : Indicators of debt policy performance will also be monitored. They
cover progress in governance (i) transfer of external debt operations to the Treasury has been
concluded; (ii) issued code of conduct for treasury officials; (iii) issued debt management
guidelines and procedures)]; capacity building: [(i) regular middle office reports on the debt
portfolio and STN operations; (ii) annual borrowing plan disclosed; benchmark
development: (annual borrowing plan, initial benchmark and medium term debt strategy
established).
117.  Supervision will also cover reform actions other than the key actions indicated in Table 4.
Other actions are summarized in the Annex 3, which provides a broader account of the
Government's overall fiscal reform program. In addition to actions, supervision will also focus
on an assessment of outcomes. This covers, inter alia macroeconomic variables (e.g., growth,
inflation, the current account); other fiscal variables (the PSBR, federal and sub-national fiscal
performance; meeting of targets under the PPA; evolution of personnel expenditures, and



43
indicators of debt management performance, (e.g. average maturity, duration, foreign exchange
debt, secondary market liquidity, and average cost of debt).

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING
118.  The loan would disburse under the Bank's provisions for fast disbursing operations,
which require no procurement of goods or services. The flow of the proceeds form the loan
would be as follows:
* The Bank deposits the proceeds in a Govermment's account at Banco do Brasil, New York;



44
* The proceeds enter into the Central Bank of Brazil's International Reserves Account,
denominated in dollars;
*  The Central Bank enters the counterpart proceeds, denominated in domestic currency, into
the Government's account at the Central Bank (the Conta Unica do Tesouro). This account
earns the average yield of Treasury bills at the Central Bank;
*  The Conta Unica do Tesouro has a classification of funds by revenue source. The domestic
currency proceeds at the Government's account at the Central Bank (Conta Unica do
Tesouro) are classified as Resources from Foreign Credit (account item No. 148);
*  Expenditure of the proceeds from the loan at the Conta Unica do Tesouro is earmarked, in
the Federal Budget, for repayment of federal external debt;
*  To repay debt, the Government uses the earmarked domestic currency proceeds in its Central
Bank account to purchase the required dollars from a bank;
*  The procedures described above are subject to Ministry of Finance internal controls
(Secretaria Federal de Control or SFC) and to external controls by the Federal Accounts
Tribunal.
The Bank may require audits of the account into which the proceeds of the loan will be
disbursed.
PROGRAM BENEFITS
119.  The overall benefits of the program would be to improve Brazil's performance on
growth, poverty reduction and public service delivery to its citizens. Direct benefits of the
program components include: (i) continued aggregate fiscal balance; (ii) improved fiscal
planning, transparency, and performance incentives, including stronger incentives for sub-
national creditworthiness; (iii) an improved federal financial management system, (iv) improved
incentives for civil service performance; (v) a long term expenditure framework (the PPA),
closely linked to the budget, and (vi) quality of debt management raised to international best
practice for large open economies. These direct benefits translate into the more fundamental aims
of fiscal sustainability, allocative and technical efficiency of public expenditures, and better
public services to Brazil's citizens. Para. 74 above indicated how the different parts of the
program may contribute to these aims. These are aims that ultimately have a bearing on
economic welfare. Fiscal sustainability implies an eventual reduction in debt levels that will help
reduce real interest rates and increase economic growth. Increased allocative and technical
efficiency of public services has a direct bearing on economic welfare of the population. Also,
given the importance of education and health in public expenditures, these services play a direct
role in poverty reduction.
LESSONS LEARNED
120.  There has been much international experience in the areas covered by the Government's
fiscal reform program. In the area relating to the fiscal codes like the LFR, existing academic
research has focused on the role of both political institutions and budget institutions. As
discussed in Annex 4, research in political institutions suggests fiscal stability is more
challenging in political systems that, like Brazil's, have a high degree of proportionality in
representation. Although Brazil's well-established democracy, with a standard length of a
government duration, favors fiscal discipline, its system of proportional representation (with



45
three senators per state, at least eight representatives per municipality, and five major parties)
makes consensus building more challenging, particularly under conditions of weak party

29 Under its proportional system, voters elect senators and representatives rather independently of the candidates'
party affiliation, with politicians often migrating from one party to another. The high proportionality and the weak
affiliation of politicians to party institutions have made it more challenging to achieve fiscal discipline in Brazil
than in many other countries because under these institutions political consensus often requires a relaxation of fiscal
performance. Marcos Josd, "Incentivos Eletorais e Desequilibrio Fiscal de Estados e Municipios ", unpublished
mimeo, 1998, provides an extensive discussion of the impact of political institutions on fiscal performance. At
present, a political reform bill has been submitted to Congress to strengthen part affiliation.

programs or activities is difficult.30 These issues support the need for Brazil to carefully plan
how program managers will be integrated with program operations (or vice versa), as well the
need to develop deeper program evaluations which explore linkages between activities,
outcomes, and objectives.
124.  For introducing formal evaluations, international experience has indicated the importance
of formal and systematic linkages between evaluation results and the budget process. 31 The
Ministry of Planning has acknowledged the importance of integration, and has requested advice
on integrating evaluations into the budget process.
125.  The SIAFI 21st Century proposal is largely consistent with lessons learned in Brazil in
relation to the management of large governmental information systems, as well as with
international experiences in relation to the normal life cycle of integrated financial management
applications in the public sector.
126.  An important lessons learned are that systems have to be flexible to accommodate
various types of users, and that their technology must permit adaptation without major structural
changes or programming, to new legal and policy environments and to ever changing
institutional arrangements. The large centralized mainframe-system like the current SIAFI,
accessible only by terminal did not provide these facilities. Because of this, "management
version" of SIAFI had to be eventually implemented and there is not adequate and efficient
integration between its original and more recent subsystems. These and other lessons are being
taken into account for the design and development of the new SIAFI 21 st Century.
127.  The normal life span of IFMS systems in Latin-American countries comparable to
Brazil's size and complexity of their federal systems has been much less than SIAFI's 13 years
in operation. The Argentine SIDIF system was developed around 1992 and - similarly to SIAF1-
using computing languages and environments that even then were close to obsolescence, was
subject to comprehensive technological and functional modernization in the late nineties,
including the development of institutional or "local" SIDIF version to be implemented in
ministries and other entities finances with federal budget resources. In the case of Mexico, the
SIAF application developed and implemented in the federal treasury department in the early
nineties has been recently replaced by a new, more modem version.
RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION PROCEDURES
128.  The risks that the benefits of the program supported by the proposed operation might not
materialize can be discussed in terms of its different components. Risks could include: (i)
macroeconomic shocks with an adverse bearing on domestic interest rates, growth, and fiscal
performance; (ii) weak impact of the LFR with an adverse effect on fiscal planning or fiscal
execution; (iii) weak management of PPA programs, resulting in poor implementation and
evaluation of those programs; (iv) weak link of evaluation of PPA programs to program
budgeting and program management, resulting in low gains in terms of allocational and technical
efficiency and of service delivery to the public; (v) SIAFI; (vi) inadequate consensus on

completion of administrative reform, with and adverse bearing on personnel costs, on personnel
management, and on the quality of service delivery.
129.  Macroeconomic Shocks. Brazil's economic performance is subject to external and
domestic shocks, particularly those emerging from changes in interest rates and changes in
public expenditures. Three possible risks are discussed:
* Deterioration of fiscal Performance due to higher interest rates. The effects of an
exogenous increase in interest rates (due, for example, to reduced international investor in
emerging markets), are considered first. First, the direct effect of an interest rate increase on
fiscal performance is discussed. Under a standard fiscal sustainability accounting framework,
the effect can be measured by the impact on the end-year debt to GDP ratio in 2001 of an
increase of one percentage point in the average real interest rate of the year. Given the
assumptions on other key variables of the fiscal sustainability framework (GDP
growth=4.5%; primary balance=3%), the effect is an increase of 0.3 of a percentage point in
the debt/GDP ratio. This effect would be offset by an increase of about 0.35 of a percentage
point in the annual primary surplus (as a percentage of GDP). This means that Brazil can
manage annual real interest increases of up to about three percentage points in the real annual
interest rate with an increase of one percentage point in the primary surplus. Since the onset
of the Fiscal Stability Plan, Brazil has demonstrated its ability to implement changes in the
primary surplus of that magnitude and more.
-  Deterioration of arowth due to hi2her interest rates. Second, the impact of an increase in
interest rates on output is considered. Recent work by the IMF has addressed this question in
the context of a vector autoregression model that traces the effects of monetary shocks that
result from an changes in the SELIC rate.32 The effect is described as powerful and
persistent, with the impact of a two standard-deviation increase in the annual SELIC rate (an
increase of about 4 percentage points) leading to a decline in output of up to almost 1%
within about seven months. These measurements point not only to the power of monetary
policy but also to the risks of other exogenous factors that might raise (or lead the authorities
to raise) interest rates. However, based on the recent experience in Brazil, such a shock,
while disruptive, would also be likely to cause Brazilian authorities to undertake fiscal
adjustments to offset or reduce the fiscal impact of increased rates. This fiscal adjustment
could have an additional temporary adverse effect on the growth rate, lasting while the policy
response works its way to reduce debt, help enhance confidence and lower interest rates.
*  Impact of higher spendin2 on the current account. Third, the effect of higher govermnent
spending financed by higher debt is analyzed. Recent work by the IMF has also addressed
this question, this time in using their dynamic multicountry macro model (MULTIMOD)33.
In this model, increased spending affects private savings and investment, and the current
account through higher government absorption and higher risk premia on Brazilian financial
instruments. The real would depreciate in real terms because the positive impact on the real
exchange rate (defined as reais per dollar) of higher risk premia would more than offset the
negative impact of increased government absorption. This would initially improve the current
account. However, the positive impact on net exports would eventually fade away and the
final outcome would be deterioration of the CAD and a higher level of net foreign liabilities.
32 See IMF, Brazil - Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix, SM/00/25 1, November 10, 2000, Section VII.
33 See IMF, ibid., Section X.



48
The effects generated by the MULTIMOD simulations run over several years. The risk that
the shock that triggers this scenario materializes is contained by the strengthened fiscal
policy framework, where increases in expenditures are restricted by the stronger budget
constraints being faced by governments and by the provisions of the Law of Fiscal
Responsibility.
130. The Law of Fiscal Responsibilit . A low impact of the LFR could result from weak
incentives for fiscal responsibility, including weaknesses of LFR remedies. One critical factor
here is the strength of budget constraints faced by the public sector. A relaxed budget constraint,
in terms of a relaxed access to credit, would weaken the relevance of the LFR, as governments
would plan on expanding expenditures with additional borrowing, leading to increased
indebtedness. The risk of relaxing budget constraints is contained by Brazil's commitment to low
inflation and by current levels of debt that are already high by historical standards. Brazil's
commitment to low inflation means that it would bot be politically rewarding to risk fiscal
instability resulting in monetary expansion. High levels of debt mean that access to new debt is
costly and that service on existing debt is already a heavy burden on public budgets. Higher
indebtedness would further increase cost or reduce access, and further worsen the burden of debt
service on public budgets. Both these factors (commitment to low inflation and high debt levels)
suggest that the budget constraint faced by Brazil's government is likely to be stronger than in
the past.
131.  A second critical factor is weak enforcement of the LFR. Weak enforcement may result
due to (i) the exclusion of voluntary transfers for health and education from the prohibition to
provide voluntary transfers to those governments that do not comply with key LFR provisions to
with an adverse effect on fiscal planning or fiscal execution; (ii) the low share of new credit in
the revenues of many governments (new credit is another remedy for non-compliance with key
LFR provisions; and (iii) inadequate monitoring/prosecution of non-compliance with LFR
provisions with penal implications under the Law of Fiscal Crimes. The exclusion referred to in
(i) above indeed means that the voluntary transfers remedy will not be a critical factor
determining the success of the LFR (although, as discussed before, some governments are
reacting positively to the possibility of its application). Similarly, the ban of credit will be
irrelevant to the many governments that borrow little. Nevertheless, for some governments that
are envisaging new credit operations to finance critical investment projects, the credit remedies
likely to encourage compliance with the LFR. Finally, on (iii) above, there is the perception that
penal legislation is an important deterrent to official misconduct, and that the strength of such a
deterrent has been increasing. Indeed, recent data on dismissals by reason of misconduct have
shown a significant increase over the last few years. It is believed that such a rise responds more
to better monitoring and prosecution than to a higher propensity for misconduct.
132.  The Multiannual Plan. There are risks to PPA's sustainability and to achievement of its
full potential. These include
* political change, or the risk that the reform may weaken during an incoming administration,
or simply ignored and left to decay. To mitigate this risk, the Ministry of Planning is using a
strategy of gradual implementation of PPA, emphasizing the benefits of data for management
improvement rather then initially emphasizing only accountability.
* bureaucratic resistance, or the risk the reforms will be actively opposed or simply ignored
by the bureaucracy, thereby undermining the success of the PPA initiatives (e.g. performance



49
management, improving program management, coordinating with other activities, use of
evaluation results, and reflecting program priorities in budgets and program implementation).
Threats to the bureaucracy are also being downplayed in terms of elimination of duplicative
activities. Initially, this is being left to Ministries to identify and address (e.g. reallocation of
these resources to other areas). If this does not succeed, at some future date, the Ministry of
Planning may initiate steps to eliminate duplication.
* change management, or the risk that Congress, in particular, is not able to quickly adapt to
the new program format and means of making budget choices, and thus reject the change
entirely, or require simultaneous transmittal of the proposed budget in the old format. The
speed with which the new format is adopted and used is partially influenced by Ministry of
Planning or Executive branch efforts to explain and train external groups on the use and
interpretation of the new format. Similar concerns arise relative to line Ministries and
Departments
* PPA integration in the budget, or the risks that resource allocation or budget execution be
impervious to evaluation. This risk will begin to be tested next year, when Congress approves
the LDO for the 2002 budget, which should reflect the evaluation presently being conducted.
A related risk is that the absence of full-cost accounting undermine transparency and lead to
poor policy decisions because of misrepresentation of resources allocated to programs and
the relationship of staff costs to program outcomes. Integration of PPA into the budget would
be part of the technical assistance project that is under preparation.
* program manager integration into program operations, or the risk that, given their
limited role, programs managers be unable to influence activity managers to cooperate or
achieve the full potential productivity gains from coordinating activities linked into
programs.
Any of these may reduce the effectiveness of PPA, and lead to its revision or abandonment. But,
there are threats faced by any public sector reform effort in any country. The Ministry of
Planning is aware of these issues, and is atternpting to manage risks and improve the probability
of PPA's success.
133.  For integration of program managers into program operations, the Ministry of Planning is
deliberately not pressing this issue immediately, to reduce threats to the bureaucracy. However,
the Ministry is contemplating additional reforms to strengthen the role of program managers,
including the possibility of channeling resources through program managers, who would then
"contract" with the Ministry departments and activities.
134. The Integrated Financial Managiement System. Like any large systems development
project, SIAFI 21st Century faces important implementation and completion risks, for which
there are a number of equally important mitigating factors.
Technological risks
135.  From the technological standpoint, consideration is being given to models, platforms,
environments and development techniques and tools which represent a dramatic departure from
those prevailing since the current SIAFI system was developed and implemented some 13 years
ago. This will have major effects on information resources both, during project execution and
later for post-implementation maintenance. System users will be migrating from a character



50
mode interface environment to a graphic mode Windows environment, and to an internet
environment. System availability for 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, while being a benefit,
will also represent work scheduling challenges both for information resources and users.
136.  However, technological risks are mitigated by the careful approach being taken by both,
the STN and SERPRO in terms of validating technological alternatives and choices through
extensive pilot testing at each of the three proposed system layers (data, application and user
interface) with the support of external consultants and the participation of potential suppliers of
goods and services. Other mitigating factors include current training of information resources in
the use of the design and development tools that will be used in the construction of applications,
as well as plans to provide extensive training to users of the systems before the various
subsystems become operational. Another consideration is that while the technology being
considered is new in a SIAFI environment, there is substantial successful experience with it, both
internationally and in Brazil. Finally, SERPRO has a very solid and longstanding experience as
a developer and operator of government systems in Brazil, including the development of the
current SIAFI system and its operation during the past 13 years, thus it is familiar with the
Brazilian legal framework and rules of the business for public sector financial management at all
federal government levels.
Political and financing risks
137.  The risk of changes in political priorities are always higher in the case of multiannual
projects requiring high levels of investment. Technological risks may materialize producing
delays and cost overruns in project implementation which could result in a loss of political favor
and of completion funding. Coordination between project completion and the budgeting and
financial schedules may be lost because of technological or funding delays, resulting in project
implementation breakdowns. General economic and financial conditions may force a
government to cut down on new and ongoing projects. A new administration may decide to
pursue a different approach for a project that has high-profile incidence over government
management systems, transparency and accountability.
138.  Notwithstanding these and other completion risks, the SIAFI 21"t Century project is
being proposed not only as a much needed technological development in view of the increasing
obsolescence of the current SIAFI, but it is also supported on major policy actions, such as the
PPA and the Fiscal Responsibility Law (LRF), which are key components of the current
administration's program. The project is scheduled to be completed during the current
administration's term in office. Being instrumental to facilitate monitoring and evaluation of
performance under the PPA and the LRF, it is likely to remain funded until completion, though
implementation delays taking completion beyond the current administration's term could have
less predictable effects. The project's implementation schedule is based on the gradual
completion and implementation of its various subsystems and modules, thus there is built-in
flexibility to establish development priorities in coordination with budgeting and financial fiscal
year schedules. The fact that subsystems or modules of the current SIAFI will continue operating
as needed during the implementation of the project substantially mitigates the risk of financial
management breakdowns.
139.  In summary, while SIAFI 21t Century faces the various types of implementation and
completion risks inherent to a project of its type and scope, there are also important mitigating



51
factors that support its viability, among which stand out the very conservative approach of STN
and SERPRO for the validation of technological alternatives and the fact that the project falls
within the framework of major policy initiatives such as the PPA and the LRF.
140.  Debt Managzement. The major risk of the debt management component is that the
program be unable to achieve a reduction on the current vulnerability of the debt portfolio, in
particular the refinancing and interest rate risks. The institutionalization of a sound debt
management practice, that incorporates a risk management framework (ALM), could face two
risks: (i) changes in the macroeconomic and market conditions make the effort an extremely
expensive and difficult challenge to pursue; (ii) the project is not properly supported and
consolidated within the Ministry of Finance and as a result becomes ineffective.
141.  In the first case, changes in the external macroeconomic conditions, manifested in the
market's willingness to purchase longer term and/or fixed rate instruments, could reduce or
neutralize the effect of the project on reducing the vulnerability of the debt portfolio. However,
the existence of a well-structured organizational capacity properly supported on the policy side
would reduce the size of the impact of such macroeconomic change.
142.  In the second case, the risk is that the proposed institutional and organizational changes
do not achieve a critical mass. As a result, proper governance structure, such as a debt
management committee and a portfolio benchmark, does not get formally sanctioned by the
Minister. The Treasury is not able to create a sustainable and credible structure to really guide
and implement the new policies. The credibility of the Treasury as a capable manager of the debt
relies mostly on the capacity to maintain a well qualified and motivated group of managers and,
to a less degree but also important, to provide managers access to the analytical and operational
tools which allows them to execute their tasks properly and efficiently. The risk that institutional
changes do not achieve a critical mass is mitigated by (i) the fact that many key changes have
taken place or are on the way to taking place without signs of lack of government commitment;
(ii) the authorities are aware, given the size of Brazil's bonded debt of the strong need for good
debt management that will contain risks and long term costs. Therefore, the risk that the
authorities would let the program or reforms to weaken or slow down is small.

ANNEX 1: LETTER OF SECTOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY
Brasilia, December 20, 2000
Mr. James D. Wolfensohn
President
The World Bank
Washington, DC
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn:
This letter of sector policy discusses progress in the economic program of the Brazilian
Government, including main developments in its fiscal, public expenditure and debt management
policy framework. We request financial assistance from IBRD, in the form of a programmatic
public sector adjustment loan and in support of the implementation of these policies. Brazil's
Fiscal, Public Expenditure, and Federal Debt Management Reforms are central components of
the Government's reform program. We believe they constitute important initiatives of the
Brazilian Government to be supported by the Bank under a programmatic adjustment loan.
Macroeconomic Outcomes and Prospects
The Economy from 1997 through 2000
2.    Brazil has achieved its macroeconomic targets in the last few years and looks towards the
future with a solid basis for sustained growth. The economy has shown resilience to external
shocks and has registered increases in production and employment within a context of decreasing
inflation. Real GDP growth is expected to reach 4 percent in 2000 and all major forecasts point
to rates of four percent and over in the years ahead. Unemployment declined to 6.7 percent last
September from 7.4 percent in September 1999 in a context of a strong reentry in labor market.
Inflation has remained subdued despite external shocks, particularly high oil prices. There are
solid grounds to achieve the 6 per cent central inflation target for 2000. Moreover, the
Government has already announced a 4 per cent target for 2001 and 3.5 per cent target for 2002,
with a two percentage points margin. These targets are in accordance with commitments made
within the context of MERCOSUR.
3.    Strict fiscal discipline has been maintained at all levels of government and constitutes the
best guarantee for solid non-inflationary future growth. Brazil registered a 3.23 percent of GDP
primary surplus in 1999 and is committed to produce a 3.1 percent surplus at year end 2000.
From January to October, the overall public sector primary surplus, encompassing the Federal
government and the Central Bank, States and Municipalities and public enterprises, reached 3.25
percent of GDP. The public sector borrowing requirement has decreased from 5.75 percent of
GDP in December 1999 to 4.13 percent last October. The Federal government performance has
been the main force behind positive fiscal results, showing a primary surplus of 2.6 percent of
GDP from January to September 2000. But States and Municipalities' results have also seen an
important turnaround. Since mid 1999 they have shifted from permanent deficits to positive



54
results. States and Municipalities' primary surplus from January to October reached 0.52 percent
of GDP against a 0.23 percent in December 1999. This is the result of a solid implementation of
the agreements reached between the Federal government and 25 States as well as with 180
Municipalities, including all the largest Municipalities. The fiscal result of State enterprises has
also remained strong, with the production of a 0.88 primary surplus between January and
October 2000, against a 0.64 percent surplus in December 1999. As a consequence of reforms
introduced in the social security system of private workers, the social security deficit has halted a
trend of permanent deficit increases. From 1999 to 2000 the deficit has been kept stable at R$
6.7 billion. The budget for 2001, submitted to Congress forecasts a primary surplus of R$ 28 .1
billion, consistent with the consolidated target of 3% of GDP. At the same time, a target for
2002 was set at 2.7% of GDP.
4.    Despite the stringent fiscal efforts, the Government has successfully protected key social
expenditures. In the 2000 budget, twenty two priority programs in education, health, labor and
social assistance were protected, all of them treated in the context of previous IDB and World
Bank structural loans. At the same time, the Federal government is implementing a program to
improve the quality and focus of spending in the social area. The first positive results in health
and education were shown in the Pesquisa Nacional de Amostragem por Domicilio - PNAD
(National Household Sample Survey) of 1999, released by the Brazilian Institute of Geography
and Statistics (IBGE) in July 2000. Moreover, a new important initiative - Programa Alvorada
- was launched, to support income growth in areas with human development index below the
national average. In December 2000, following a Senate deliberation, the House approved in a
first round a constitutional amendment establishing the Poverty Combat Fund.
5.    The Brazilian privatization program has been following its course. A major recent event
in December 1999 was the privatization of BANESPA, the largest State bank, sold to Banco
Santander for US$ 3.5 billion. FDI, of which privatization is only a small portion, achieved US$
29.9 billion in 1999 and US$ 22.9 billion from January to October 2000. The expectation is that
for the calendar year 2000, FDI will reach an amount between US$ 25 billion and US$ 30
billion, more than enough to finance the current account deficit, that is expected to amount to
approximnately US$ 25 billion.
The Government's Fiscal, Public Expenditure and Debt Management Programs
6.    A number of important structural reforms were undertaken recently covering the fiscal
area, debt management and the budgetary process. Such reforms are the best guarantee for a
solid and healthy economic performance in the years ahead. What follows is a brief description
of the main features of the reforms.
Fiscal Management
7.    A historical milestone of Brazilian Fiscal Reform Program is the approval of the Fiscal
Responsibility Law (Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal - LRF) by the Brazilian Congress.
Establishing a code for the behavior of the public administrator, the LRF sets forth the principles,
rules and limits that provide for a responsible fiscal management at Federal, State and Municipal
levels. Planning, prudence, transparency and accountability in the management of public funds
by the Executive, Legislative and Judicial Branches are promoted, making the LRF one of the
main instruments for the long term sustainability of the fiscal adjustment.
8.    Limits for personnel expenditures and for public debt, as well as the obligation to set
fiscal targets (on revenues, expenditures, nominal and primary balances, and debt) are



55
established or required, with special provisions for electoral years. The Law also provides for
corrective measures when fiscal targets, expenditure limits or debt limits are not met. Increased
transparency and electronic dissemination of information to the public are also provided for in
the Law and constitute one of it main objectives. Moreover, the Law prohibits intergovernmental
lending and the refinancing of debt of any of the three levels of Government by the others.
Together with a set of measures in the relationship of the Federal Government with States and
Municipalities, comprising among others the privatization of public banks and the debt
rescheduling agreements, these prohibitions are among the most important steps taken to change
the face of the Country's fiscal regime.
9.    The Fiscal Responsibility Crimes Law (Lei de Crimes de Responsabilidade Fiscal -
LCRF), approved by Congress on the second half of this year, constitutes a fundamental
complement to the LRF. It introduces penal sanctions, in addition to the institutional sanctions
already provided for in the LRF, such as suspension of transfers of funds and of contracting
credit operations. Therefore, all public administrators in charge of activities related to a sound
fiscal policy may now be personally punished by, among others penalties, fines and even
imprisonment, in case of mismanagement of its fiscal duties.
10.   These important steps, however, are a beginning. A new challenge, as important as
adopting the laws, is implementation. The Brazilian Federal Government is fully commnitted
with this objective and is carrying out actions aimed at promoting and supporting their
implementation. In this context, within the timeframe provided for in the LRF, a draft regulation
establishing limits for Federal bonded debt and a draft law creating the Fiscal Management
Council (Conselho de Gestdo Fiscal) were submitted to Congress and a draft regulation setting
the limits for the public consolidated debt (comprising Federal, States and Municipal
governments) was submitted to the Senate.
11.   The implementation of the LRF at sub-national level is of fundamental importance.
Under the LRF, States and Municipalities are expected to improve their fiscal performance
through befter planning, management and transparency. In particular, fiscal planning will provide
for the preparation of fiscal target and fiscal risk annexes to budget guidelines laws (leis de
diretrizes orcamentarias) introduced by all levels of government except municipalities with a
population below 50.000 inhabitants. Also, fiscal management will include high frequency
reporting on budget outcomes and compliance with targets. The Federal Government is taking
the necessary steps to promote the follow up, consolidation and analysis of data to be generated
by States and Municipalities, comprising the information on targets, risks, fiscal management,
and fiscal accounts required by the law. It will also monitor sub-national debt levels and provide
for making the information on such levels available to the public. The consolidated reports on
States and Municipalities will constitute important tools to evaluate the fiscal policy in Brazil
and the effectiveness of the LRF. The Brazilian Government has initiated conversations with the
Bank seeking its support to a technical assistance project that will  help develop LRF
implementation at sub-national level and allow a comprehensive analysis of the perspectives and
risks for the public sector based on the budget guidelines laws (leis de diretrizes orqamentarias)
for 2002 to be adopted by States and Municipalities. The initial stage of the project will be
limited to a small number of Municipalities.
12.   In terms of outcomes, the LRF will help sustain fiscal adjustment at the sub-national
level, where, as noted before, the primary surplus increased considerably. As a result of the
improved fiscal performance, sub-national net debt levels (as a percent of net revenues) have



56
been stabilized and are likely to remain so or decline during 2001-02. Together with the
declining debt revenue ratio at the federal level, these developments at the sub-national level are
expected to encourage private sector investment and growth, a key condition to further reduce
poverty rates.
Public Expenditure Management
PPA
13.   The Brazilian Constitution requires the President to present to Congress every four years
a Pluriannual Plan (PPA) with the government plan and targets for the next four years. The PPA
for 2000-2003 (called Avan,a Brasil) presented on August 31, 1999 by President Cardoso, and
approved by Congress, sets a new paradigm for government planning and defines the strategic
orientation for the government, aiming at consolidating the economic stability while promoting
sustainable growth and development, employment and income generation, fighting poverty and
social exclusion, strengthening democracy and protecting human rights, reducing regional
discrepancies and promoting minorities' rights.
14.   A study carried out by a consulting firm, under the supervision of the Ministry of
Planning, Budget and Management and the National Bank for Economic and Social
Development, identifying the National Integration and Development Regions (Eixos Nacionais
de Integra,do e Desenvolvimento), listed the social and economic investment opportunities, with
special attention to their contribution to regional integration. After an innovative and
comprehensive process of consultations with the general public and sub-national governments
all over the Country, a group of 388 programs were identified by the Federal Government.
These programs form the PPA, covering all actions of the Federal Government, including
investments in areas such as energy, transportation, telecommunications, social development,
environment, information and knowledge, to be carried out in partnership with the private sector,
whenever feasible.
15.   Ultimately, the PPA approach will contribute to improve the delivery of public services.
An important PPA program - Programa Qualidade no Servi,o PuTblico, or Public Service
Quality Program - aims to achieve a 70% satisfaction rate by 2003 among customers of
governmental agencies that adhere to the program (1200 thus far with the aim of reaching 3000
by 2002). Other PPA programs with a focus on improved service delivery include the Program to
Reduce Bureaucracy (Programa de Desburocratiza,do), with 420 measures already enacted, and
a results oriented Public Management Program (Programa Gestao Puiblica Empreendedora).
Under these programs, the streamlining of public institutions is aimed at, with focus on better
serving the citizens, establishing regulatory agencies, with self-sustainable and flexible
management structures, as well as supporting new entities with private administration and public
purposes, to enhance the cooperation between public and private sector. Additionally, targets for
2003, timetables and monitoring indicators were set and are available to the public. The
Government will annually monitor the programs to identify those that are on track.
16.   The PPA sets the conditions for a better integration of the planning instruments available
to the Federal Government: the PPA itself, the Budget Guidelines Law and the Budget Law. The
draft Budget Law for 2001 presented to Congress changes a 25 years practice of functional
budgetary allocation (classifica~do funcional-programatica) and incorporates the concept of
"programs", with their respective targets and indicators. It shall pave the way for more
efficiency, better quality and enhanced transparency of public expenditures. Presently, the
Ministry of Planning, Budget and Managernent is conducting a general evaluation of programs



57
and their management, with inputs from program managers and from the corresponding sector
ministries. Such an evaluation will facilitate the identification of priority programs to be
included in the draft 2002 Budget Guidelines Law, which will be submitted to Congress in April
2001. The evaluation itself will also be sent to Congress. The definition of priority programs, for
which the Government intends to ensure full budget execution, is a key tool of the Government's
budgetary and development policy.
17.   The change in planning is followed by a change in management. Based on the successful
experience of the Brasil em Aqao Program (1996-1999), a new management process was adopted
to promote entrepreneurial behavior. For each program a manager was appointed and trained.
This represents a major departure from long-standing and well-established practices and
behavior within Brazil's public sector. It is necessary to provide the managers with the abilities
and tools required for the successful completion of their tasks. In this regard, a management
information system (SIG) has been established but needs to be improved. The improvement
involves among other steps providing internet access to the public. Access will complement the
existing AvanCa Brasil and Infra-estrutura websites, will enhance PPA transparency and
visibility and will strengthen the sustainability of the PPA process. A training program for
program teams will be implemented during 2001-02 Moreover, for a better integration of the
planning process, it is necessary to improve the programs' performance evaluation mechanisms
and the framework in which they will feedback, together with other factors, into the budget.
The Government expects to implement this effort during 2001 with the Bank's support, under
the above referred technical assistance project.
SIAFI 21't Century
18.   Since 1987 the Federal Government Financial Administration Integrated System (SIAFI)
has been operating. At that time it was a state of the art system that inspired several sub-national
and even foreign systems. SIAFI nowadays integrates more than four thousand units of the
Executive, Legislative and Judiciary Branches, including the indirect administration, and offers
total transparency regarding the uses and sources of public funds. Presently, more than fifty
thousand transactions are registered daily in the system, of which about 30% refer to payments
made, including all relevant data.
19.   After several expansions and additions and in the context of the improvements already
promoted in the public expenditure management, the Federal Government considers it is time to
adopt a new mechanism, consistent with the challenges of the new century. The project SIAFI
21st Century is being conceived as a response to the necessity of including new features to and
updating the technological basis of the system. Among the new features to be incorporated are:
web interface, to create a more user friendly environment; 24 hour/ day and 7 days/week
availability; increased number of simultaneous accesses; increased transparency, through an
internet gateway public information center (Portal SIAFI); budgetary planning, to further
facilitate and improve the interface with the budget; effective expenditures control, with costs
appropriation by administrative unit and program; and integrated register and control of the
stocks and flows of the National Treasury's assets and liabilities, including internal and external
debt. Additionally, the new system will have enhanced reporting capabilities and will allow
monitoring the financial condition of States and Municipalities. The new system will be an
important tool for the National Treasury to better perform its role, addressing its main needs
regarding its operations and the management of Federal finances, budget and debt, under the new
Law of Fiscal Responsibility and the PPA framework. Implementation of the SIAFI 2lt Century
project has already begun with the initial development of its five modules (financial



58
management, budget management, monitoring of States and Municipalities, public debt
management and re-engineering of treasury operations). The Government expects to complete
most of the implementation of these modules by 2002. Contact with the Bank has been initiated,
aiming at its support under the referred technical assistance project. The support could cover
advice and assistance in technological and implementation management, as well as cost-
effectiveness issues.
Administrative Reform
20.   Fully aware of the importance of a modern public administration to support sustainable
growth and economic stabilization, the Brazilian Government is promoting a comprehensive
reform of the public administration. Several measures have been adopted in the last few years,
including constitutional changes to redefine the role of the state and allow for more flexibility in
dealing with personnel issues. Among these measures and in addition to the new management
system for public programs referred to above, more than 100 thousand public positions were
closed, a draft law was proposed to Congress in order to regulate the dismissal of public
employees based on insufficient performance and a strict salary increase policy has been adopted
and thoroughly implemented. Administrative Reform has been a key tool to help contain
personnel expenditures, which, under the Fiscal Responsibility Law, will be limited to 50% of
net revenues at the Federal Government level and to 60% of net revenues in States and
Municipalities by 2001.
Debt Management
21.   The Government has given renewed attention to improving debt management. A new
institutional arrangement, consistent with the Brazilian public administration practices is being
developed, taking into account the worldwide trends. The first concrete measure is the
proposition, within the National Treasury's structure, of three units - modeled as front, middle
and back offices, with the responsibility for short term strategy dealing with primary bond
issuance, for the development of public debt's  long term strategy and relationship with
investors; and for federal public debt's registration, control, budgetary and financial
programming, payments and statistics.
22.   These new institutional arrangements are made in the framework of transference, to the
National Treasury, of the duties carried out by the Central Bank, such as bond issuance in the
domestic market for monetary policy purposes and management of external liabilities, including
bond issuance in the foreign market. On the domestic side, such transference process is well
advanced. Central Bank activities are now limited to advising the National Treasury and issuing
domestic debt denominated in foreign currency. On May 4, 2002, as provided in the Fiscal
Responsibility Law, the Central Bank will no longer be authorized to issue securities in the
internal market and will have to ask the Treasury to proceed to any issuing associated with the
execution of monetary policy. Issuance of bond in the foreign markets will be carried out by the
National Treasury in due time.
23.   The central objectives of debt management are: (i) to extend the average maturity of
domestic debt issues, (ii) to reduce refinancing risks, (iii) to reduce the cost of borrowing taking
into account adequate risk level, (iv) to gradually increase the duration of debt and reduce
foreign currency denominated bonded debt, (v) to develop and consolidate an yield curve in the
domestic market of securities with a prefixed rate and indexed to IGP-M, and (vi) to improve the
secondary market for public sector securities. Through these efforts, the maximum maturity of



59
domestic bonds has already increased from the previous benchmark of 3 months to 24 months. In
international placements, a successful forty- year issue was recently made
24.   Several other measures have also been adopted with regard to debt management: (i)
beginning in 2001, an Annual Borrowing Plan, with the objectives, strategies and expectations
for each fiscal year, will be made available to the public; (ii) establishment of an unit within the
National Treasury with the sole purpose of assessing and quantifying contingent liabilities; (iii)
establishment of annual limits for foreign loans to be contracted or guaranteed by the Federal
Government; and (iv) proposals of draft resolutions and law, to the Senate and to Congress
House, respectively, setting borrowing limits for Federal, State and Municipal Governments, as
well as for the Federal bond issuance.
25.   Notwithstanding the progress already made, it is necessary to further seek the
development of primary and secondary markets, the establishment of a benchmark curve for
Federal bonds in the domestic market, and the consolidation of Brazil's image as sovereign
issuer in the main international markets. For those purposes, additional actions are to be
implemented such as (i) consolidating the National Treasury's organizational structure; (ii)
strengthening National Treasury's governance, with better guidelines and procedures and with
clearer delegation and accountability framework ; (iii) development and improvement of risk
analysis and portfolio management tools; (iv) improvement and integration of existing
information systems; and (v) development of studies with the objective of establishing
benchmarks and medium term funding strategy.
Request for Financial Assistance
The Government remains firmly committed to its program of reforms as outlined above,
and would welcome World Bank financial assistance. We appreciate the prompt consideration of
the first US$ 750 million Programmatic Fiscal Reform Structural Adjustment Loan, in support of
the measures that have been enacted and are under implementation. We look forward to working
together with the Bank on a proposed future loan as further fiscal, public expenditure and debt
management reforms take place.
Yours sincerely,

ANNEX 4: BRAziL's NEW FIsCAL CODE
1.    In May, 2000, Brazil's Congress approved a new fiscal code known as the Law of Fiscal
Responsibility (Lei Complementar No. 101). The Law partly addresses Article 163 of the
Constitution, which requires issuance of a complementary law (i.e. a law intended to provide
detail on constitutional provisions and requiring only a simple majority for approval) regulating
public finance, public debt and guarantees, issuance and redemption of public bonds, inspection
of financial institutions, exchange rate operations by public agencies, and functions of public
financial institutions. The LFR covers public finance and debt. It does not regulate the budget
process, which is covered by Article 165 (9, II) of the constitution. The budget process is
presently regulated by Law 4320 of 1964. This annex provides a brief perspective with regard to
the impact of institutions on fiscal performance, describes the main components of the LFR,
evaluates how Brazilian fiscal institutions have been strengthened by issuance of the law and
other provisions, indicates the possible impact of the law on Brazil's fiscal sustainability, and
points to the risks in the successful implementation of the law.
Political Institutions
2.    The study of the impact of institutional factors on fiscal performance follows two
different strands of thought. One refers to the impact of political institutions; the other, to the
impact of budgetary institutions.  With regard to the impact of political institutions, the
hypotheses that have been tested in international comparisons suggest a strong link of political
stability (normally measured by the frequency of government changes) to fiscal performance,
with shorter government duration having an adverse impact on fiscal performance. Although
causation can go both ways, the argument can be made at the theoretical level, that governments
with too short a life have reduced incentives to undertake sustainable fiscal policies, as the
benefits of sustainability are reaped well beyond their terms in office.
3.    If it were as simple as indicated above, it would be easy to argue that Brazil's has good
political conditions for fiscal stability: a well-established democracy, with a standard length of a
government duration. But the politics of fiscal consensus are more complex than the simple
relationship indicated above. As an example of the further complexity, recent political analyses
argue (i) that a large number of representatives per district encourages proportional
representation, multiparty systems and coalition or minority governments; while (ii) "first-past-
the-post systems" (i.e., "systems where only one representative is elected per district and all
seats go to the winner") encourage two-party systems. As political systems move towards large
numbers of representatives per district, countries gain a higher degree of proportionality in
representation but are likely to have less decisive governments due to a weaker support in a more
polarized congress.
4.    Brazil's political system is one of proportional representation, with three senators per
state, at least eight representatives per municipality, and five major parties. But Brazil's system
has a further feature with a bearing on fiscal performance. Under its proportional system, voters
elect senators and representatives rather independently of the candidates' party affiliation, with
politicians often migrating from one party to another. The high proportionality and the weak



68
affiliation of politicians to party institutions have made it more challenging to achieve fiscal
discipline in Brazil than in many other countries because under these institutions political
consensus often requires a relaxation of fiscal performance. 34
Budget Institutions
5.     But fiscal outcomes also depend critically on budgetary institutions. At an empirical
level, much research in the European Union, the USA, and Latin America, have found important
effects of fiscal institutions on fiscal performance. For example, the level of stringency of
balanced budget rules in US has a negative effect on state deficits. Also, in Latin America,
"...countries with a high index of budget institutions tend to have lower deficits and lower debt
levels than countries with a low index of budget institutions."35
6.     Following recent Bank work on Brazil36, key budget institutions for aggregate fiscal
discipline can be classified as follows (i) ex-ante constraints; (ii) dominance of central budget
agencies; (iii) ex-ante agreements; (iv) multi-annual macroeconornic programs, (iv) numerical
limits. The effectiveness of these institutions depends on the extent to which the budget covers
all public sector activities (budget comprehensiveness); the exte;nt to which expenditures are not
autonomously driven (budget flexibility); the extent to which the budget covers revenues and
expenditures for the whole period for which it is approved (i.e. restraints on supplementary
budgets); the strength of budget constraints on sub-national governments and SOEs (i.e. no
bailing out or intergovernmental credit); the adequacy of the education and tenure of key
decision makers; and the strength of transparency and accountability, as determined by the
strength of auditing, ex-post reconciliation, sanctions, information, freedom of press, democracy,
education, and financial openness. With the effectiveness conditions listed above present, the
decision makers can formulate and implement valid primary balance and debt targets that are
consistent with fiscal discipline. It is in this area of budgetary institutions that Brazil has been
making major progress in its institutional conditions for aggregate fiscal discipline.
The Law of Fiscal Responsibility and the Law of Fiscal Crimes
7.     Brazil's new  Law  of Fiscal Responsibility (LFR) covers fiscal planning, budget
programming, budget execution, debt, credit, guarantees, net worth, transparency, and control.
The main provisions of the new law are described as follows:
*  The new law introduces planning of key fiscal variables in Brazil's budget legislation. The
federal and sub-national governments must now indicate, in the annual laws that regulate
budget programming, three-year targets with respect to revenues, expenditures, the primary
deficit and debt. Indication of these targets reflects federal fiscal policy since 1998. In 1998,
the federal government announced a fiscal stability plan for the public sector that has been
implemented rigorously. With the new law, the fiscal planning introduced by that plan has
been institutionalized and its scope deepened to sub-national governments.
34 Marcos Jose, "Incentivos Eletorais e Desequilibrio Fiscal de Estados e Municipios ", unpublished mimeo, 1998,
provides an extensive discussion of the impact of political institutions o fiscal performance. At present, a political
reform bill has been submitted to Congress to strengthen part affiliation.

*  Under the LFR, governments must indicate contingent liabilities and the policies to be taken
in case those liabilities materialize.
*  Fiscal execution must limit expenditure commitments when revenues fall below target.
Revenues and expenditures are monitored through a publicly disclosed and disseminated bi-
monthly report. Compliance with targets are monitored through a fiscal management report
issued every four months.
*  Expenditures are subject to (i) consistency with PPAs and LDOs; (ii) net increases in
permanent expenditures (expenditures legally mandated for more than two years) not to
exceed increases in permanent revenues; (iii) limits on personnel expenditures revenues
(50% for the federal government; 60% for states and municipalities) and on the distribution
of those ceilings among branches of government37; (iv) new  social security services to
indicate source of financing.
*  Debt/revenue ratios are subject to limits to be established by the Senate. A draft Senate
resolution on net federal debt establishes a maximum net debt/revenue ratio of 3.5. The ratio
is presently 3.45. The draft resolution of sub-national debt establishes a maximum net
debt/revenue ratio of 2.0 for states and of 1.2 for municipalities. As many states and
municipalities exceed these ratios, a linear adjustment during a fifteen year period is
contemplated. Excess debt needs to be corrected in 12 months.
*  Borrowing is subject to: (i) textual legal authorization to borrow and inclusion in budget; (ii)
compliance with limits on the debt stock; (iii) total borrowing not to exceed investment
expenditures; (iv) Senate authorization (for external loans); and (v) compliance with LFR;
* Intergovernmental lending is prohibited except by public financial institutions. Guarantees
are permitted, provided that a counter-guarantee with a higher value is furnished and that the
borrower is not in default with the guarantor;
*  Disclosure and dissemination of PPAs, Budget Directive Laws (LDOs), Budgets, Public
Accounts, public debt, budget execution summary reports, and Fiscal Management Reports is
mandatory;
*  The federal government is responsible for consolidation of public sector accounts and
establishment of a federal registry of public sector debt.
8.     With the LFR, Brazil has then combined two key fiscal institutions: ex-ante constraints
and multi-annual planning, i.e., the three-year fiscal objectives that must be indicated in the laws
that regulate budget programming. It has also strengthened numerical limits, or the debt/revenue
ceilings that the Senate must issue. These new features add to the dominance of the Finance
Ministry in preparing the budget and to multi-annual planning (the PPA). Thus Brazil now has
institutions in place that allow aggregate fiscal discipline.
9.     As indicated before, the effectiveness of budget institutions depend on a number of
factors (para. 5). In the case of Brazil, effectiveness shortcomings include:
3 The distributed percentages for the federal legislative, judiciary, executive, and ministerio publico (Attorney
General's Office) respectively are 2.5%, 6%, 40.9%, and 0.6% for the federal level; and 3%, 6%, 49%, and 2% for
the state level. In municipalities, the personnel revenue ratio cannot exceed 54% and the other branches together
cannot exceed 6%.



70
*  Excessive autonomy of some parts of the budget: autonomy has been tempered by legislation
that "taxes" autonomous expenditures to increase flexibility);
*  Lack of comprehensiveness of the budget (due to the impact of sub-national budgets, over
which the federal governrment has no control); the adverse impact of this lack of
comprehensiveness, which emerges out of Brazil's federalized system, has been tempered by
stronger budget constraints faced by sub-national governments due to debt-refinancing
agreements that securitized debt repayment obligations and stronger legal constraints on debt
and borrowing;
*  Weakness of ex post restraints, as a result of excessive supplementary budgets: monetary
stability and stricter rules has reduced the need for supplementary budgets;
*  Relative softness of budget constraints on sub-national governments: as discussed, budget
constraints on sub-national governments are now stronger due to securitization of their debt
repayment obligations and stronger constraints on debt and borrowing (partly established
through the LFR);
*  Inadequate information with regard to fiscal performance, particularly at the sub-national
level: the LFR has addressed this issue by mandating extensive disclosure and dissemination
of budget documents, reports and accounts.
*  Limited ex-post reconciliation: with the Law of Fiscal Responsibility, reconciliation of
outcomes with plans is mandated, through Fiscal Management Reports, issued every four
months by all governments.
10.   Incentives for compliance with the LFR come from Brazil's macroeconomic policy
framework, from the LFR itself, from penal provisions, and from the stronger budget constraint
faced by sub-national governments. First, political support for Brazil's stable macroeconomic
framework places a constraint on monetary financing of the federal deficit. Brazil now has an
inflation targeting framework in place that reflects country commitment to monetary stability.
Targets were set at 8%, 6% and 4% respectively for the IPCA index duringl999-2001, with a
margin on each side of two percentage points. Inflation in 1999 was 8.9%. In its September
2000 inflation report, BCB expected an inflation of 6.7% for the year 2000 (similar to the
market's median expectation in September of 6.3% for the year) and an inflation below 4% for
2001 (somewhat lower than the market's median expectation in September of 4.3% for 2001).
Furthermore, the high level of real interest rates in Brazil places a constraint on excessive resort
to public sector borrowing. With interest rates an irnportant determinant of growth, federal
policies, including fiscal policies, have an incentive to reduce public sector indebtedness, not to
increase it.
11.   Second, the LFR has five sources of remedies for various instances of non compliance
with the LFR. These are prohibition of intergovernmental voluntary transfers (excluding
transfers for health, education, and social assistance), borrowing, guarantees, constitutional
transfers, and adjustment of primary balances. One or more of these remedies apply to non-
compliance with several provisions regarding tax collection, personnel expenditure limits, debt
limits, default, and fiscal accounts and reports. Because transfers for health, education, and
social assistance are excluded from the voluntary transfers remedy and borrowing is a minor
share of revenues in most governments, particularly municipal, the effectiveness of LFR
remedies is limited. Nevertheless, in many governments, access to the included transfers is



71
important and the remedy may be a factor in encouraging compliance. For example, many
municipalities are reportedly making efforts to raise collection of their property taxes, partly to
avoid the LFR provision that prohibits voluntary transfers to those governments that do not
collect projected taxes.38
12.   Third, penal provisions have been added to strengthen compliance. The new Law of
Fiscal Crimes (Law No. 10.028 of October 19, 2000), added non-compliance with certain LFR
provisions to Brazil's Penal Code (Decree-Law 2848 of 1940), to Law 1079 of 1950 (covering
misconduct by federal and state authorities, including the president, the attomey general
(procurador geral), ministers, governors, and state secretaries), and to Decree-Law 201 of 1967
(covering misconduct of municipal elected officials). As a result, under the Penal Code officials
that borrow illegally, that include uncommitted expenditures or expenditures exceeding limits in
accounts payable (restos a pagar ), that instruct payment of non-authorized expenditures, that
grant guarantees without required counter-guarantees, that fail to clear amounts exceeding legal
limits in accounts payable, that raise personnel expenditures during the last year in office of an
administration, or that issue unauthorized public debt bonds, are now subject to imprisonment.
13.   Under Law 1079, officials (president, ministers, governors, and state secretaries) that do
not instruct the reduction of debt to legal limits, that instruct or authorize expenditures not
included in the budget, that fail to repay/cancel loans made exceeding limits, that fail to repay
advanced revenue loans (Antecipa,do de Receita Or,amentaria) within the year, that instruct or
authorize illegal intergovernmental lending, that borrow against un-accrued future tax receipts,
that use the proceeds of bond issues for a different destination than that for which they were
intended, or that extended or received voluntary transfers in conflict with legal provisions, are
now to be fired. Under Decree-Law 201, the same applies to municipal elected officials.
14.   Also, under the new Law of Fiscal Crimes, officials that fail to disseminate the Fiscal
Management Report, to send LDO proposals without the Annex of Fiscal Targets, to reduce
expenditure commitments and payments (movimenta,dofinanceira) when required by law, or to
implement measures to reduce personnel expenditures to legal limits, are subject to a personal
fine of 30% of their annual salaries.
15.   Fourth, compliance with the LFR is also encouraged by the stricter budget constraint
being faced by sub-national governments. This stricter constraint originates in (i) the debt
refinancing agreements with most states and some municipalities, whereby the federal
government granted refinancing at a low interest rate and a capped debt service/revenue ratio,
with the condition of securitizing debt service payments with constitutional and voluntary
transfers; (ii) the more restricted access to borrowing emanating from the prohibition of
intergovernmental lending and more stringent conditions imposed on new borrowing.
Possible Impact/Benefits of the LFR
16.   In addition to the LFR, there are other reforms that are having an impact on Brazil's
aggregate fiscal performance, defined as the path of the primary balance, the public sector
borrowing requirement, and the stock of debt. These reforms include the Government's 1998
Fiscal Stability Plan, which runs through 2001 and contemplates measures to generate fiscal
3 See Gazeta Mercantil, December 5, 2000, P. A-8.



72
surpluses that suffice to reduce the public sectors debt/revenue ratio; the refinancing agreements
with most states and some municipalities, which strengthened the budget constraints faced by
sub-national governments; and social security and administrative reforms, which are helping
contain personnel expenditures.
17.   The impact of these reforms can be described as allowing the fiscal stance indicated by
the Federal Government in its last Budget Guidelines Law (Lei de Diretrizes Orqamentarias,
LDO). In the Annex on Fiscal Targets to that Law, the federal primary balance is targeted at
2.6% of GDP in 2001, 2.2% in 2002, and 1.8% in 2003. The fiscal stance for the overall public
sector would then be equivalent to 3% of GDP in 2001 (the target under the revised Fiscal
Stability Program), and 2.7% in 2002 and 2.2% in 2003, assuming a constant primary balance of
states and municipalities. The impacts are discriminated as follows:
*  The Government's 1998 Fiscal Stability Plan provides the basic framework of fiscal
policies for 1999-01 and the fiscal targets to be attained. It provides an ex-ante agreement
and a commitment to fiscal stability. Since the Fiscal Stability Plan has been in force since
1998, it provides a positive test of the possible working of the LFR.
*  The LFR provides the institutionalized Fiscal Stability framework for fiscal policies at all
government levels, including provisions on fiscal targets, revenues, expenditures, debt,
borrowing, and transparency described above. These strengthen fiscal planning, budget
execution, and budget constraints. It is already providing this framework at the federal level
for 2001, as the federal 2001 was issued in July 2000, following approval of the LFR the
previous month.
*  The debt refinancing agreements with most states and some municipalities strengthen the
budget constraints face by these governments through (i) a securitization of debt service
obligations which is forcing fiscal adjustment at the sub-national level ; (ii) a commitment to
a set of fiscal targets (gross debt/revenue ratio, primary balance, personnel expenditures,
revenues, privatizationlconcessions, investment expenditures.
*  Under the Administrative Reform approved in 1998, governments will be able to dismiss
personnel when their personnel expenditures exceed limits regime (full regulation of this
provision still needs to be completed). Furthermore, the public sector will hire through the
private sector labor regime, under which retirement benefits are much lower (1.8 minimum
salaries) than under the public sector regime (13 minimum salaries, on the average). These
reforms will have an impact only in the very long term.
*  Social security reforms, which have increased contribution time, reduced retirement time,
reduced pension benefits, or increased contributions. These have temporarily stabilized the
social security deficit.
In sum, the actions with a significant effect now are the 1998 Fiscal Stability Plan Stability (an
ex-ante agreement on fiscal targets), the LFR (the institutionalization and deepening of ex-ante
constraints on fiscal targets and ex-post reconciliation of those targets), the refinancing
agreements, and the recent social security reforms. The overall fiscal impact can be described by
the expected path of the ratio of the public sector's net debt to GDP. The impact thus far has
been to stabilize the debt level within 48%-50% of GDP after having risen sharply between 1995
(30.3%) and January 1999 (53.4%). This level is likely to decline slowly after 2002.



73
18.   One of the critical challenges of fiscal adjustment is fiscal adjustment at the sub-national
level. As indicated, the debt refinancing agreements both aim at deepening adjustment.
Ultimately, the joint effects of the LFR and the other provisions discussed above can be
summarized in the behavior of the public sector debt, where changes reflect the behavior of the
primary balance and the interest rate. Chart 1 shows the ratio of net debt to disposable revenues
on a monthly basis for the federal and sub-national govermnents since January 1998. 39 The ratio
of net federal debt to net federal revenues increased from 1.2 in December 1997 to about two
(i.e., debt twice as much as revenues) in January 1999 (when the dollar denominated debt
climbed as a result of floating the exchange rate that month). The ratio of net sub-national debt
to net sub-national revenues increased from 1.5 in December 1997 to 1.8 in August, 1999. Then,
as a result of the 1998 federal Fiscal Stability Plan (which was strengthened following the early
1999 devaluation), the debt refinancing agreements, and other provisions limiting sub-national
access to borrowing, debt/revenue trends changed course, with some decline in the federal
debt/revenue ratio from the high point in mid-1999 and a stabilization of the subnational
debt/revenue ratio within 1.7-1.8 after August 1999. The LFR is expected to reinforce this
change of course as it enters into full operation after approval in May 1999. For example, in the
Annex of Fiscal Targets to the LDO for the 2001 budget, the federal government aims at
reducing the ratio of federal debt
to GDP to 28.0%, 26.3%, and
25.1  respectively  in  2001-03,             Chart I - Brazil - Ratio of Net Debt to

weaknesses of LFR  remedies. I
One critical factor here is the
strength of budget constraints faced by the public sector. A relaxed budget constraint, in terms
of a relaxed access to credit, would weaken the relevance of the LFR, as governments would
plan on expanding expenditures with additional borrowing, leading to increased indebtedness.
The risk of relaxing budget constraints is contained by Brazil's commitment to low inflation and
39 Debt ceilings under the LFR are to be expressed as ratios to net revenues rather than as ratios to GDP (Para. 3 of
LFR Article 30).



74
by current levels of debt that are already high by historical standards. Brazil's commitment to
low inflation means that it would bot be politically rewarding to risk fiscal instability resulting in
monetary expansion. High levels of debt mean that access to new debt is costly and that service
on existing debt is already a heavy burden on public budgets. Higher indebtedness would further
increase cost or reduce access, and further worsen the burden of debt service on public budgets.
Both these factors (commitment to low inflation and high debt levels) suggest that the budget
constraint faced by Brazil's government is likely to be stronger than in the past.
20.   A second critical factor is weak enforcement of the LFR. Weak enforcement may result
due to (i) the exclusion of voluntary transfers for health and education from the prohibition to
provide voluntary transfers to those governments that do not comply with key LFR provisions to
with an adverse effect on fiscal planning or fiscal execution; (ii) the low share of new credit in
the revenues of many governnents (new credit is another remedy for non-compliance with key
LFR provisions; and (iii) inadequate monitoring/prosecution of non-compliance with LFR
provisions with penal implications under the Law of Fiscal Crimes. The exclusion referred to in
(i) above indeed means that the voluntary transfers remedy will not be a critical factor
determining the success of the LFR (although, as discussed before, some governments are
reacting positively to the possibility of its application). Similarly, the ban of credit will be
irrelevant to the many governments that borrow little. Nevertheless, for some governments that
are envisaging new credit operations to finance critical investment projects, the credit remedies
likely to encourage compliance with the LFR. Finally, on (iii) above, there is the perceptions that
penal legislation is an important deterrent to official misconduct, and that the strength of such a
deterrent has been increasing. Indeed, recent data on dismissals by reason of misconduct have
shown a significant increase over the last few years. It is believed that such a rise responds more
to better monitoring and prosecution than to a higher propensity for misconduct.

ANNEX 5: THE PPA 2000-2003 AND MODERNIZATION OF BRAZIL'S PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION
1.    The basis for a modernized public administration was laid in the 1930s as the Vargas
regime conferred a new development role on the state. Systems for a meritocratic civil service,
public procurement, and budget control were established. This investment no doubt created a
level of administrative competence and effectiveness which may have distinguished Brazil from
many of its neighbors. But from the start, the rules emphasized a rigid control of processes, and
there has been a more or less permanent effort to further reform the administrative process.
Success in this has been limited, until recently at least. In response to a perception that increasing
patronage and clientelism were undermining the quality of the administration, the 1988
Constitution went in the opposite direction and reinforced the inflexibility of the system by
giving job stability to public servants at all levels of government and severely limiting the power
of the Executive to restructure the administrative apparatus and introduce performance-oriented
incentives system.
2.    The 1995-99 reforms. The early 1990s were, as part of a wave of "first-generation'
reforms, a period of frustrated downsizing. Civil servants were substantially successful in
resisting the efforts of the Collor Government to remove a large number of them. The
Government also severely reduced the number of ministries, only to have the next Government
(of Itamar Franco) reverse this. Meanwhile, administrative capacity had substantially weakened
as a result of the economic crisis that began in the 1980s.
3.    Administrative modernization came back on to the agenda in 1995, with the creation of
the Ministry for Federal Administration and Reform of the State (MARE), under the first
Cardoso Government. MARE developed an ambitious approach to putting the house back in
order, enshrined in its "Plan Director". The Government achieved important constitutional
reforms to reverse some of the inflexibilities of the 1988 Constitution. It also did much to re-
establish discipline and merit in the civil service. This included cleaning up the federal payroll,
as well as re-establishing an effective senior executive service through a Commission, DAS. The
DAS system incorporates both senior career officials and political appointments into a limited
number of posts, with a uniform structure of remuneration and appropriate qualification
requirements. DAS thereby creates an effective corps of senior officials, as well as provides for
transparent and meritocratic rules for political appointments. On another front, the Government
made some notable advances in transparency through various information technology initiatives.
4.    But MARE made less progress in its most ambitious objective, This was to move from a
"bureaucratic" to a "managerial" administration, principally by radically altering the structure of
the federal executive. The strategy took its cue from the leading reforms then going on in some
OECD countries, but the design of the reform was substantially adapted to the Brazilian
situation. New organizational entities would be created to hive off large amounts of government
activity: "Executive Agencies" would be a key service arm of the government, enjoying
considerable managerial autonomy and linked to ministries through performance contracts;
"Social Organizations" would be created under private law to provide contestable services of a
public nature with partial public subsidy. In the event, few such new entities have been created,



76
partly because the government was not prepared to provide priority in the flow of budget funds
to such agencies. But it may also be the case that changing the management culture through
changing the organizations was too frontal an approach to change, hence too threatening to
existing interests in the bureaucracy. Organizational change of the type originally envisaged now
appears to be stillborn.
5.    The state of the federal public administration todav. While it did not move as far as it
had hoped towards creating a results-oriented culture, the government's reform efforts of 1995-
99 did succeed in a recuperation of the effectiveness of the public administration (as well as of
public financial administration), while they also succeeded in putting further performance-based
managerial reform firmly on the agenda. We can venture the following hypotheses about the
current (pre-PPA) state of administrative performance:
*  Brazil's administration is, compared to many of its neighbors, reasonably well endowed with
middle- and higher-level professionals, thanks to the DAS system and thanks to ministry-by-
ministry merit-based career systems and reasonable pay levels. In addition, informal
networks may serve to reinforce the effectiveness of the higher cadres. Yet numerous
imperfections remain in career rules and salary systems. For instance, horizontal (inter-
ministry) and vertical (promotion) mobility are impeded; the competitiveness of salaries with
the private sector has been eroded since the mid-1990s; pay scales are compressed. One
result of these imperfections is to accentuate the unevenness of levels of capability and
professionalism across ministries.
*  The improvement in fiscal stability since the Real Plan has allowed a recovery in the budget
and financial management system as an instrument of managerial control.
  With these reasonable levels of human resources and financial control, Brazil's federal
ministries are effective, relative to their homologues in many other countries of the region.
For better or worse, the ministries are marked by different cultures, perhaps reflecting their
different objectives and challenges, different institutional histories, and the often distinct
characteristics of their professional corps.
-  It is not clear how Brazil's political system affect the capacity of civil servants and ministries
to work without undue particularistic pressures. Fragmented parties, coalition government,
and the strong constitutional role of Congress and State Governors might all be elements
expected to add to these pressures. There is evidence, in academic studies and observations
among analysts, of strong political pressure affecting financial resource allocations. Yet a
first impression is that Brazil's administration does not face the same level of day-to-day
politicization that some other countries in the region experience.
*  In spite of the overall capacity of the administration, in a comparative-regional context at
least, its financial and other procedures, ministerial structures, and working cultures have
been designed (prior to the PPA at least) to concentrate on form rather than results. This is
reflected in almost seven decades of effective application of strongly hierarchical rules and
the persistent failure of reform efforts to change that paradigm. Effective hierarchy has
probably served Brazil better than the ineffective systems - ineffective because they have
been undermined by patronage and clientelism-- typifying many countries of the region. But
there now appears to be a strong consensus in the leading parts of the government (and
consistent with the viewpoint of MARE) that it is time to transform a bureaucracy organized
along Weberian lines into a more managerial format.



77
6.    The approach of the PPA 2000-2003 to administrative modernization. The PPA's new
approach to administrative modernization departs from similar managerialist objectives to
MARE's Plan Director. But the PPA adopts different tactics, seeking to reorganize the way
government business is done around clearly defined programs, rather than frontally re-structuring
organizations per se. It can be inferred that the PPA's implicit intent is to challenge the
organization of existing agencies by putting the programs inside them. The main building blocks
of PPA's approach to management are as follows:
*  The government's business is organized into programs which stress the desired output,
rather than the logic of production. In the PPA preparation process (1998-99) the Planning
and Budget Secretariats of the Planning Ministry effectively worked in parallel to re-
apportion all of the federal government's business into 365 programs. (In passing the PPA
the Congress added 23 Programs to bring the total to 388.) Each Program is attached to one
federal Ministry or agency, although many of these Programs will require actions in other
ministries or at sub-national levels of government. In fact, these Programs can be seen as
essentially putting existing public business into new boxes, while adding some new business
(i.e., akin to incremental budgeting). For tactical reasons there was relatively little emphasis
on cutting existing business. But the new boxes, as well as some of the newer Programs,
emphasize a strategic approach that emphasizes outputs and outcomes rather than inputs or
processes. For instance, a transport corridor Program would emphasize the integrated multi-
modal system that is needed to move goods or people from A to B, in contrast to a program
to build, say, a road. Thus, in order to provide a more effective approach to satisfying the
populace's real demands, these Programs imply a challenge to existing government
"production" processes and the organizations they fall into.
*  Programs provide a transparent basis for performance orientation. Programs have simple,
self-explanatory titles, objectives, subsidiary actions necessary to obtain these objectives, and
output indicators for these actions. This information is publicly available through the
Internet. In turn, Programs and actions are clearly linked to required budgetary resources for
the four-year PPA period.
*  The Program-based PPA is fully linked to the budget document. The PPA combines current
and investment costs of programs. The 2000 Budget has adopted the same program basis as
the PPA, and the first year of the PPA has been fully translated into the 2000 Budget
document. It remains to be seen, however, how the PPA and the annual budgets adjust
themselves to each other over time as the budget execution diverges from the approved
budget and thus from the PPA. There is also a question of actual fund allocations to
Programs vs. organizational units. Except for those ministries such as Environment, which
have adjusted their organizational structures to the Program structure, there may still be an
effective disconnect between actual flow of funds ( to the traditional organizational units)
and the PPA allocations (to Programs). These points would still need to be clarified in
subsequent work.
*  The four-year PPA has procedural links with three-year macro planning, but how the
relationship will work in practice and how the PPA can adapt to unexpected shocks is not yet
clear. Annual changes in the budgetary resource envelope will be guided by the macro-
targeting of the Law of Fiscal Responsibility (LRF). Normal year-on-year incremental



78
adjustments to the Programs will occur through various Program amendments that will
require administrative decisions and, in some cases, legal amendments to the PPA. The
Planning Ministry has identified 87 Strategic Programs on the basis of a system of weighted
criteria. But how this might be formalized as a guide to managing annual adjustments in PPA
and the budget is not yet clear. Nor is it clear how the PPA would be adjusted in the event of
an unexpected shock.
*  The PPA system is strongly committed to an evaluation system, but this has not yet been fully
developed. The Planning Ministry intends to carry out the first round of plan and program
evaluations in partnership with the Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA). Further
work on the evaluation framework will be undertaken in 2001, probably with Bank
cooperation under the TA loan currently under preparation.
* The Programs and their links with budget and expenditure management are supported by a
series of Internet-based information systems. A management information system (SIG)
provides information and feedback on Programs and their implementation to Program
Managers, SPI, and Ministries, and is being extended to the public. Brazil is also well served
by a series of related systems for budgeting and execution (SIAFI, SIDOR?).
-  Managers are appointed for each Program. Working within the structure of a Ministry or
agency, they have the responsibility for executing that Program, although in most cases this
responsibility has not (yet) been matched with the necessary resources. Managers are
appointed by the Ministry or agency within which the Program falls. They are usually drawn
from existing senior staff and, typically, continue to hold other line responsibilities (such as
Director). The conditions under which the Managers work vary across Ministries and
agencies. In some cases, Programs have been incorporated within existing organizational
charts, somewhat as if they were departments or divisions. In other cases, Managers find
themselves as change agents, with few or no resources and with the task of using their access
to information and moral authority to get other parts of the ministry or other federal or sub-
national agencies to cooperate. In either case, to be effective Managers often have to work
across formal structures and through informal channels - across ministries, with sub-national
governments, and so on. This often reflects the "matrix" natures of Programs which are
intended to produce outputs through coordinated actions among relevant sectors or sub-
sectors (such as a transport corridor) rather than project outputs within a particular sector or
sub-sector (such as a road). Thus the Programn approach, often at odds with existing
organizational structures, is implicitly designed to apply pressure to change those structures.
Change is already emerging in some Ministries, such as Environment and Transport.
*  The Program approach and the role of the Manager are being strongly supported by the
training activities of the National Schoolfor Public Administration (ENAP), as well as by the
Planning Ministry itself
7.    The implicit political approach of the PPA to managerial reform can be distinguished
from that of the Plan Director. Both have sought similar performance-oriented objectives, but the
PPA has had a less frontal approach, planting the seeds of change through the Program approach,
but establishing in the first place only transparency and strategic clarity, and not yet pushing on
full accountability and the incentives necessary for this. The pace is not being forced:
organizations are being challenged, but not directly changed.

SOME HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE IMPACT OF PPA
8.    The approach of the PPA has had an initial impact which can be characterized as laying
the basis for further improvement in three dimensions of public expenditure performance:
* Macroeconomic balance: a clear link between planning and budgeting processes has been
established. While the macroeconomic framework for the PPA was apparently based on
conservative projections, the PPA is not itself the macroeconomic instrument. This is the role
of the LRF and the annual budget cycle. It remains to be seen how well the PPA will be
articulated with the LRF and the annual cycle.
* Prioritization: the PPA so far has, by establishing Programs, clarified -- i.e. made transparent
-- the Government's plans and projected these over a four-year period. In general, the
Government has not so far used the PPA process to change its priorities, though it has
identified a strategic core among its existing programs. A better basis for subsequent change
has now been established. For instance, the room for rationalizing - reducing waste -will
now become clearer.
* Efficiency issues have been addressed in two directions. First, Managers have been given
some responsibility for promoting Programs and achieving their goals, though the steps taken
so far have been modest. Second, by their design, many Programs have adopted a more
strategic approach emphasizing end-needs of citizens, rather than processes.
9.    Finally, the PPA seems to have a strong political grounding. The implicit tactic is to first
seek transparency, better public-expenditure practices, and more assured resources before
rationalizing Programs. It is hoped that this will thereby minimize the threat to bureaucrats. The
reform is substantially "home grown", using lessons from the Plan Director and the previous
PPA (Brasil am Aqao). And it seems to be taking political root: it has the support of the President
and the leading ministries, as well as of a number of senior managers.
THE ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED.
10.   The challenge Brazil has set itself of moving its bureaucratic mode towards greater
performance orientation is formidable. Among the non-OECD countries, few can be said to have
made any serious progress beyond Chile, Malaysia, and Singapore. In spite of the much
discussed (and sometimes disputed) achievements of countries such as New Zealand and the
United Kingdom, the New Public Management is still in many ways terra incognita. It is clear
that, given the nature of public goods and services, the public sector cannot adopt all the methods
of the private sector. It is also likely that for countries such as Brazil, managerial reform can only
go as far and as fast as politics and popular demand will allow it.
11.   Brazil's greatest challenge in preserving the PPA experiment will be to maintain fiscal
stability. If Programs do not have a credible assurance of available budgetary resources over the
medium term, performance is bound to fall short. Given that Brazil still has not completed the
process of fiscal reform and given the volatility of international capital markets, fiscal stability
over the long term is far from assured, and fiscal shocks must be anticipated. The PPA and
budgetary authorities need to ensure that the links of the plan and the budget are improved and
that an agreed procedure exists for accommodating the PPA to unforeseen shocks.



80
12.   The process of managerial reform is only just beginning. The introduction of the Program
and the concept of the Manager have laid some building blocks for this, but the challenge will be
to give Managers enough resources and authority to make them accountable. This in turn will
require organizational change, reinforcement of human resources, and the introduction of
monitoring and evaluation as a regular activity. The way ahead is not obvious, there is room for
experiment, and, for the moment at least, there is virtue in heterogeneity of forms and
approaches. It would make sense for SPI to encourage different approaches in different
ministries and invest in understanding these differences. In this regard, it could be useful to
create a taxonomy of different types of Program according to the "production" problems they
tackle (e.g. who produces the final "product"-the federal government or, say a municipality?
How measurable is the output? In what sense is an output strategic?). As managerial reform
develops, Brazil will in turn need to adjust the present model of budgeting and accounting for the
Programs. Full managerial accountability will, for instance, require full costing of Programs.
13.   There will be a constant challenge of matching the timing of progress in the PPA to
political realities, in the form both of "big-picture" politics - for instance "pork-barrel" behavior
- and of bureaucratic politics - the resistance of civil servants to change. It is such considerations
which will indicate when and how fast ineffective or politically-inspired Programs can be cut.

ANNEX 6: BRAZIL'S INTEGRATED FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
INTRODUCTION
1.   In 1986 the Brazilian government initiated the development of an integrated
financial management system (IFMS), with the purpose of improving its control over
public expenditure. Known as SIAFI, the current system became operative in January
1987. It is a very solid and proven system managed by the national treasury (STN), which
is part of the Ministry of Finance (MOF).  The system is currently  processing
approximately 50,000 documents per day originating in more than 4,500 government units.
SIAFI provides on-line access to over 33,000 individual users. In brief, SIAFI is the core
system used by the Brazilian government to program, process and control the financial
execution of the federal budget. It also is the federal government's main accounting and
fiscal reporting system.
2.    Notwithstanding that over its 13 years in operation SIAFI has undergone a number
of functional modifications and upgradings the system is close to become obsolete because
of new technological developments and major changes in Brazilian fiscal rules, and new
approaches to fiscal management with important effects on institutional arrangements.
Maintenance of the system, both functionally and technologically is becoming increasingly
costly, making upgradings and operational integration with other modem government
systems more difficult..
3.    The introduction and implementation by the federal government of (a) a program-
based multiannual plan budgeting framework (PPA), (b) a Fiscal Responsibility Law
(LRF), (c) improved institutional arrangement for public debt management, and (d) new
institutional arrangements for asset/liability management, impose additional fiscal
monitoring and evaluation challenges that cannot be efficiently undertaken by SIAFI unless
the system undergoes major functional and technological upgrading. Taxation reforms
presently on the drawing board may also require important changes in SIAFI's
functionality, in particular in relation to managing the distribution of revenues to states and
municipalities. Consequently, since 1999 the STN has been pursuing a project to develop a
so-called SIAFI 21st Century proposal with the objective of accommodating SIAFI to this
new fiscal management environment and modernizing its technological platform.
4.    Originally, the development of the new SIAFI was to begin in 2000, but scheduling
and budget constraints forced a one-year postponement of the program. The STN reports
that funding of the program for an approximate amount of US $ 20 million has been
included in the federal budget proposal for 2001 presently being considered by the
Brazilian Congress. Additional federal funding amounting to approximately US$ 29
million in 2002, and US$ 1.5 million in 2003 will be required to complete the deployment
of the new system. This includes the development of a new multi-modular IFMS software
package, significant upgrading of the hardware and communication platforms, and massive
training of users. Under present plans, the new SIAFI would become operational January
2003, completely replacing the current SIAFI.



82
OVERVIEW OF THE BRAZILL4NBUDGETING PROCESS
5.    Though it is not an specific purpose of this Annex to discuss the Brazilian budgeting
process, but to review the SIAFI 21" Century proposal, it is useful to provide a brief
overview of such a process since it is the operating framework of SIAFI.
6.    Financial management and audit systems. The Brazilian government has recently
redefined the organization of its federal planning, budgeting, financial administration,
accounting and internal control systems by way of a Presidential decree (Medida
Provisoria Nro. 2.036-80 of June 27, 2000), which has the force of law. Four distinct
federal systems have been defined:
(a) The Federal Planning and Budget Systems, under the responsibility of the Ministry
of Planning and Budget (MP), with the mission of (i) formulating strategic planning at
the national level; (ii) formulating the social and economic development plans at the
national, sectorial and regional level; (iii) formulating the multi-annual plan (PPA), and
annual budget guidelines (LDO), as well as the annual federal budgets (OGU); (iv)
managing the federal planning and budgeting processes; and, (v) promoting co-
ordination with local governments, seeking compatibility in the norms and actions of
the various systems at the federal, estate, district and municipal levels. The decree also
lists the various specific activities to be developed by the central, sectorial and specific
planning and budgeting units.
(b) The Federal Financial Administration System, under the responsibility of the STN,
with the mission of (i) balancing the national treasury, managing the national treasury's
assets and liabilities; (ii) preparing the financial programming of the national treasury,
managing its unified account (Conta Unica); (iii) formulating financing policies for
public expenditure; (iv) managing internal and external public debt under the Union's
or the National Treasury's responsibility, including that with international agencies; (v)
issuing financial programming, budget and financial execution standards; (vi)
promoting the monitoring, systematization and recording of the execution of public
expenditure; and, (vii) promoting co-ordination with the other constitutional powers and
government sectors in matters dealing with financial programming.
(c) Federal Accounting System, also under the responsibility of the STN, with the mission
of (i) maintaining the accounting systems the Union's budget, financial and patrimonial
administration; (ii) keeping record of the operations of governmental organs and entities
and their effects on the structure of the Union's patrimony; (iii) keeping record of
outstanding revenues, of the execution of budget appropriations, as modified by
additional credits (i.e., budget modifications during the fiscal year), of estimated and
collected revenues, expenditure commitments, accruals and payments against such
revenues, and available balances; (iv) keeping records on the operations and balances of
anyone responsible for collecting revenues, ordering and making expenditures, or
administering en entrusted assets; (v) keeping record of the patrimonial situation of
public entities and variations thereon; (vi) keeping records of the cost of federal
administration's programs and units; (vii) keeping records of the application of the
Union's resources by federative unit; and (viii) keeping record of waivers of revenues
by federal organs and entities. The decree also lists specific responsibilities of the
accounting units under the system; and



83
(d) The Federal Internal Control System, under the responsibility of the Federal Control
Secretariat (FCS) of the MOF, with the mission of (i) evaluating the compliance of the
targets of the multi-annual plan (PPA); (ii) fiscalizing and evaluating the execution of
the government's programs, including decentralized actions funded with resources of
the Union's budgets, and considering the level of execution of established target and
objectives and the quality of management performance; (iii) evaluating of the execution
of the Union's budgets; (iv) controlling credit operations, including guarantees, and of
the Union's rights and assets; (iv) providing information about the physical and
financial execution of projects and of permanent activities funded through the Union's
budgets; (v) performing audits of the management of federal resources under the
responsibility of public or private organs and entities; (vi) investigating and evaluating
acts or facts deemed illegal or irregular performed by public or private agents involving
the use of federal resources, and take them as may warranted before the responsible
accounting unit for further action; (vii) performing audits of the accounting, financial,
budget and human resources systems, and all other systems; (viii) evaluating the
performance of internal audit activities in the indirect federal administration; (ix)
preparing the annual report on fiscal accounts submitted by the president to Congress;
and, (x) creating conditions for the performance of social or citizen controls over the
programs funded by the Union's budgets.
While these systems already existed in substantially comparable forms before the
enactment of the decree, the importance of these renewed definitions is their updating and
upgrading in terns of PPA and the LRF objectives, replacing standards dating as far back
as 1983, and supporting new institutional arrangements.
7.    Institutional arrangements of the Brazilian budgetin2! process Budgeting in
Brazil is organized into two distinct processes. The MP is responsible for the formulation
of the annual federal budget proposal (OGU, for General Budget of the Union) and of
programming its execution once it is approved by Congress, whereas the MOF is
responsible for the control and accounting of budget execution, and financial programming
thereon. The Brazilian annual budget formulation process is regulated by three main legal
instruments, as indicated in Table A6. 1.

MAIN APPROVAL PROCESSES IN BRAZILIAN FEDERAL BUDGETING
The PPA bill must be submitted by the
Executive Branch to Congress by August
31 t of the first year of its four-year term.
Multi-annual Plan Law        Congress must approve it by December 15th,
(PPA)                Once enacted, the PPA will be in effect to
the end of the first year of the next
administration.    The  PPA  establishes
directives and targets for capital and current
expenditure by the federal government and
for its multiannual mrograms.
The LDO bill must be submitted by the
Executive Branch to Congress by April 15th
each year. Congress must approve it by June
Budgetary Directives        30th. It establishes the administration's
Law                  targets and priorities for the annual federal
(LDO)                 budget for the following year, including
capital expenditures, changes in taxation
and the credit policies of development
banks.
The OGU bill must be submitted by the
Executive Branch to Congress by August
31 st each year. Congress must approve it by
December 15th. It must include the budgets
Annual Federal Budget        of the Executive, Legislative, and Judiciary
Law                  branches, the attorney general's office,
(OGU)                 government funds, direct and  indirect
administration   entities,    including
foundations receiving public funding.  It
must also include the capital investment
budgets of public enterprises, as well as the
social security budget.
8.    Once the annual budget law is approved by Congress, the MP and the MOF interact
with each other and with spending units, initiating a continuous flow of decision-making,
evaluation and information processes to manage, control and assess the physical and
financial performance of the budget during the fiscal year, as illustrated in Box A6. 1.

9.   IT systems supportin2 the budget process. The MP's  planning, budget
formulation and budget programming functions are supported by a system known as
SIDOR, while MOF budget execution, financial planning and accounting functions are
supported by SIAFI. While not integrated as a single operating system, SIDOR and SIAFI
exchange data in the course of their daily operation. To accommodate program-based
multiannual planning (PPA) the MP introduced in September 1999 a new system known as
SIG, which draws on information processed by SIDOR and SIAFI to enable program
managers to monitor and evaluate program execution and performance. While SIAFI
provides historical and current information contributing to the formulation of the annual
federal budget proposal, the actual formulation process under the purview of the MP is
supported by SIDOR. In the preparation of the annual budget proposal, spending units,
ministries and other sectorial agencies interact with the MP using SIDOR's budget
formulation facilities.
10.   Once the annual federal budget law (OGU) is approved by Congress and
promulgated by the Executive Branch, the MP proceeds to program the execution of the
budget on the basis of the authorized appropriations or credits. Budget programming by
spending unit is formulated using the MP's SIDOR system from which it is transferred by
magnetic media to SIAFI to be used by the STN for the financial programming of budget
execution. Federal government cash resources are held at the treasury's unified account at
the Central Bank, which concentrates all revenues and from which all payments are made
using Banco do Brazil as the treasury's appointed financial agent.  During budget
execution, SIAFI makes automatic accounting entries for all budget and financial
transactions, and produces the financial statements of the federal government, as well as the
consolidated financial statements of the Union which consolidate the financial situation of
the federal, state and municipal governments and other relevant decentralized entities.
Throughout the fiscal year the MP's SIDOR and SIG systems will extract data from SIAFI
to monitor and control budget programming compliance by spending units, and to evaluate
program performance and results under the PPA. Also, during the year, the MP will
process modifications to the budget approved by Congress (transfers between
appropriations and additional credits of various types, some of which require Congress
approval) and through its SIDOR system the MP will export to SIAFI the resulting
variations in available credits, updating budget appropriations balances.
DESCRIPTIONAAND ASSESSMENT OF THE CURRENT SL4FI
11.  In order to understand and assess the scope of the proposed SIAFI 21st Century
project, it is important to outline the operating indicators, the financial management
functionality, and the technological platform of the current SIAFI system.
12.   SIAFI - Operating Indicators.    SIAFI has a production version  (SIAFI
Operational) used by spending units, and a management version (SIAFI Gerencial) used
mainly by management units. The current operating indicators of the present SIAFI, are
summarized in Table A.6.2.

Source: STN
13.   SIAFI is used by all ministries agencies of the executive, legislative and judiciary
branches and other entities financed by the federal budget, as the main tool for registering,
monitoring and controlling their respective budget and financial execution transactions.
The system automatically posts the corresponding accounting entries. In the course of
operations, SIAFI is also used as a management information system and as a source of
information for internal and external audits the system is managed by the STN, who
establishes SIAFI's operating logic and standards, and provides support to spending units
using the system. the STN is in turn supported by SERPRO, a decentralized data processing
services unit of the finance ministry, who is responsible for the technological development
and the operation of SIAFI, the secure storage and the integrity of data, and the
maintenance of the system.
14.   SIAFI - Financial manatiement Functions. From a functional standpoint, SIAFI's
various subsystems allow for on-line recording, posting and processing of:
(a) budget execution transactions originating in federal government spending units
throughout the country;
(b) the deposit of tax and other federal cash revenues in the treasury's unified account held
at the Central Bank, and budget classification of collected revenues;
(c) payments to suppliers of goods & services and other parties, as well as transfers
between government units. All payments are made from the treasury's unified account
at the Central Bank, using Banco do Brazil as a paying agent;
(d) federal transfers to states and municipalities, whether mandatory or voluntary
(mandatory transfers to local governments are established by the Brazilian Constitution
and are calculated and paid by Banco do Brazil from balances in the treasury's unified
account, on the basis of a percentage of actual collection of certain taxes and a
system of distribution coefficients).  The system permits temporary blocking of
transfers when a local government is in non-compliance of its financial obligations with
the federal government.



88
(e) public debt disbursements and payments (the system has tools to calculate outstandings,
amortization and interest payments, bank charges and commissions, etc.);
(f) transactions under the official credit operations system subsidizing mainly the
agricultural sector.
Upon entry of each transaction by the system, SIAFI will:
(a) automatically update balances of appropriations in the federal budget registering
commitments, accruals and payments;
(b) automatically post the corresponding accounting entries. Utilities of the system allow to
produce at anytime the federal government's interim financial statements and budget
execution statements, as well as formal closing statements at the end of each fiscal
period. SIAFI also includes a subsystem to input the financial statements of states and
municipalities in order to produce the consolidated financial statement of the Union.;
(c) automatically updates all other financial records, such as balances in the treasury's
unified account, debt outstandings, balances of mandatory and voluntary transfers to
states and municipalities, etc.
The system is based on the principle that a transaction is entered into the system a single
time, and that such single entry automatically produces all the corresponding budget,
financial and accounting entries. In order to cancel or modify a transaction entered into the
system a new transaction has to be entered in SIAFI, thus leaving a clear audit trail of any
such changes.
15.   As a management tool, SIAFI's functionality includes facilities for:
(a) programming the financial execution of the federal budget on the basis of (i) budget
programming prepared by the Ministry of Planning, and (ii) the Treasury's cash flow
estimates (financial programming);
(b) preparing and monitoring the MOF's own budget programming;
(c) managing and reconciling of the treasury's unified account held at the Central Bank and
of payments thereof by Banco do Brazil;
(d) making automatic payments under pre-established accounts receivable and accounts
payable schedules submitted by spending units (introduced in 1998, this is an optional
facility for spending units who can also enter their receivable and payment transactions
in the system individually, as they happen);
(e) daily validation and confirmation by spending unit managers of transactions and
documents entered into the system, and monthly validation and confirmation of the
system's automatic accounting entries thereon;
(f) monitoring the fulfillment of contract conditions by states, municipalities, foundations
and other entities that benefit from government funding, whether reimbursable or not.
(g) performance of detailed consultations by operational and management users, and for
preparing standardized and customized reports. It provides budget, financial and
operating information at various levels of consolidation, ranging from the federal level,
to individual ministries and other agencies, as well as per spending unit. Sectorial



89
information by region, economic or functional sector, programs, projects, etc. can also
be obtained, as well as detailed information on individual transactions. Also, the system
permits the extraction of blocks of information from its data base for importation by
other systems and applications (e.g. spreadsheets), for analysis purposes.
In addition, the system offers adequate on-line help facilities for operational users, also
making available special training modules. Specifically there is (a) an on-line educational
version of SIAFI used for the training of operating and management staff and to support
public administration programs at universities, (b) a tutorial version, for self-paced
learning, in CD/ROM format, and (c) a SIAFI Manual, which is available on-line for all
users of the system.
16.   The SIAFI's system-administration modules provide for comprehensive access, data
transfer, data integrity and data storage security, as well as for maintenance of internal
administrative and data base tables supporting the operation of the system.  The system
includes audit facilities which constantly monitor and evaluate the integrity of its internal
processes. Due to its aging development technology and frequent modifications over its 13
year life span, documentation of the system is reported as not being as comprehensive as it
should be. However the system has on-line help facilities for users.
17.   The SIAFI version for managers (SIAFI Gerencial) is mainly a data consultation
and retrieval system, which provides managers user-friendly access to information stored in
the operational version's data base by way of standardized formats or customized reporting
facilities. As SIAFI Gerencial was developed using more modern technology than the
SIAFI Operacional version (it was developed in windows/based graphic mode, whereas the
operational version is developed with less friendly character mode) it provides managers
with much more flexibility and efficiency in the manipulation of information according to
their own needs. SIAFI Gerencial is not intended for registration of data but solely for
consultation and reporting functions.
18.   SIAFI - Technological Platform. The two versions of SIAFI currently in use have
different technological platforms, as the production version was developed several years
earlier than its management version.
SIAFI production version
19.   From a technological standpoint, the production version (SIAFI Operacional) runs
on a centralized mainframe platform system based on an IBM processor 9672-R46 and 4
2/4 MB 447 MIBS processors located in Brasilia. Users throughout Brazil are connected
to the mainframe facility either through PC/emulators using TCP/TN 3270 protocol, or
through terminals connected to IBM 3X74 processors and a SNA network using a
SNA/LU2.1 protocol. The SIAFI Operacional data base is ADABAS 15 BDs, with 650
Gigabytes. The transactional environment is CICS and the development language is
NATURAL, though other languages such as Predic, Roscoe, Adabas, Cobol and Cics have
also been used for development. In the case of some functional subsystems that are
integrated to SIAFI, such as the control of assets and liabilities and the monitoring of fiscal
information from states and municipalities, spreadsheet applications or less robust
databases are used, including Access, Paradox, etc. The size of SIAFI Operacional's



90
present data base is 60 GB. The mean response time of SIAFI Operacional is 2.0s. Other
operating indicators have been provided in Table A.7.3.
SIAFI management version
20.   In its management version (SIAFI Gerencial), the system is based on a client-server
platform with a centralized Oracle data base of 13GB, running on a central Digital
processor in Brasilia. The application was developed using Oracle CASE tools and it
operates in a Windows environment. Users can access the system through the internet
using TCP/SQLNET protocols. Users PC's have FORMS/EXCELL facilities.
Telecommunications platform
21.   Both SIAFI systems (production and management versions) are supported by a vast
telecommunications network, outreaching approximately 5,000 spending units throughout
the country, as outlined in Box A6.2.
22.   Telecommunications services for SIAFI users are offered by SERPRO, a business
unit of the MOF, which is also responsible for the operation and maintenance of the
computing systems on which SIAFI runs. From its central mainframe facility in Brasilia,
the SIAFI system outreaches 6,650 spending units throughout the country by way of
SERPRO's nationwide telecommunications arrangements using the infrastructure of several
domestic data transmission services, which range from X-25 and X-28 to more advanced
Frame Relay and ATM technology, permitting links between networks using diverse
telecommunications protocols. The headquarters of federal agencies and other users in
Brasilia can access SERPRO's virtual network through Telebrasilia's high speed network.
As of September 2000, SERPRO's network arrangements had 140,000 registered users in
700 municipalities throughout the country, linking 670 local networks and 200 external
networks, serving 55,000 terminals, PC's and printers. Web arrangements can handle
40,000 simultaneous internet connections. SERPRO bills its telecommunication services to
users of SIAFI, and in turn has billing arrangements with diverse telecommunications
carriers.

both, technological and functional factors:
Technological assessment
24.   As an integrated financial management system (IFMS). SIAFI is an aging but still
performiing application, which accurately stores, processes and integrates operational
information recorded by spending units throughout the country, allowing the MOF/STN to
control the execution of the federal budget approved by Congress; to manage cash
resources and payments (including public debt payments) through the unified treasury
account at the central bank; to administer entries in the general accounting system of the
federal government;, and, to produce the consolidated financial statements of the Union. It
is also a valuable automated source of information for budget formulation and
programmning by the MP through the SIDOR system, and more recently for its monitoring
of program-based multi-annual planning (PPA) through the SIG  system.   As a
technological system STAFI plays an important role not only in providing accurate and



92
timely information to government managers at all levels, but is also instrumental in terms
of public sector fiscal transparency. However, after 13 years in operation, the system is
aging in technological terms, and its overall maintenance, both functionally and
techonologically, is increasingly cumbersome, inflexible, time-consuming and costly. Main
shortcomings are as follows:
(a) SIAFI's aging architecture does not facilitate the introduction of the advanced levels of
flexibility and agility in data processing required to satisfy an increasingly complex
financial management environment, thus the system is beginning to lag behind in terms
of information integration and analysis capabilities, as well as in relation to more
recently developed government systems, such as SIDOR and SIG, with which it has to
interact;
(b) Being of a centralized mainframe architecture, SIAFI in its present form does not allow
the introduction of more efficient data processing and telecommunication models
offering substantial efficiency gains and operating economies, such as a multi-layer
architecture for the differentiated management of the data base, the application and user
interfaces, which would provide the type of flexibility normally required by a large
modern financial management system with an scope comparable to that of as SIAFI.
(c) SIAFI was not developed with currently used techniques and integrated tools, such as
CASE based design and development, which permit automatic generation of program
codes, the efficient structuring of data bases, the introduction of extensive
parametrization facilities, and thorough documentation of the system, these being
features which reduce the time, risk and cost of modifications to adapt the system to
constant changes observed in financial management rules and processes.
(d) SIAFI was not developed in a Windows graphic environment, which provides greater
user-friendly interfaces and graphic capabilities.
In summary, in its present form and notwithstanding it is assessed as a solid and reliable
system, SIAFI represents for the Brazilian government a very high and rapidly increasing
risk of technological obsolescence for its main financial management system, as well as
very high maintenance costs into the future.
Functional assessment
25.   Since its implementation in 1986, SIAFI has been subject to constant modifications
and additions, responding to changes in financial management rules and operating
requirements in Brazil.  Between 1988 and 1999, SIAFI has had to continuously
accommodate a considerable number of major structural and operational changes, as well
as functional additions. Some of these developments were caused by changes in financial
management rules and procedures and others to improve services provided by the system in
response of user demand. This constant evolution of SIAFI and the resulting overlapping
patches in the system have added operational and structural complexities not anticipated in
the original design, and have thus weakened its integrity as a system and dispersed its
development documentation, increasing maintenance risks and costs. There is significant
and diversified demand from users for increased and/or improved functionality and for
more flexibility in information management that cannot be satisfied because of the
architectural rigidity of the system, which was designed as a large centralized mainframe



93
system accessible only by way terminals and developed in a programming language that
has been technologically overcome and can not offer Windows and graphics capabilities
which are currently commonplace.
26.   Functionally, SIAFI is presently facing the challenge to accommodate four major
new developments in fiscal/financial management in Brazil, namely:
(a) The introduction of program-based multiannual planning (PPA);
(b) The enactment and implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility Law (LFR);
(c) New institutional arrangements for debt management; and,
(d) New institutional arrangements for assets/liability management.
27.   The current SIAFI was designed to manage the information flows of a traditional
budgeting process, focused on funding the annual requirements of bureaucratic
administrative structures and of capital investment projects, rather than, as presently
required, on the funding of multi-annual programs and on the allocational and technical
efficiency of public expenditure based on strategic priorities and targeted outputs and
outcomes.
28.   Accommodatinif the PPA. A major fiscal reform presently underway, the PPA,
aims at making program-based multi-annual planning and budgeting more relevant,
operational, and effective, thus creating the need for a financial management system that
allows program costing, as well as performance and evaluation on a multi-annual basis.
The SIAFI system needs to be upgraded to accommodate this new focus of the PPA, as its
present data base structure is based on annual fiscal years rather than on multi-annual
planning. It is not specifically designed for tracking and linking expenditures to the pursuit
of program objectives. The new system must be able to allocate current and capital
expenditures to program categories and not only to agencies and their administrative units,
so that the cost and the performance of each of the 388 programs composing the PPA may
be determined and evaluated in relation to pre-established indicators and targets (e.g.
reduction in infant mortality to specified levels).
While SIAFI transactional codes have been modified to accommodate the PPA's new
program structures compromises had to be reached in order not to increase the aggregate
number of coding digits, which would have represented major and costly structural changes
in SIAFI's data base due to its aging technology. Tracking the physical execution of
programs with SIAFI as per PPA performance monitoring and evaluation requirements
would require the introduction of major changes in SIAFI data base and data capture
structures, which is a costly proposition if applied to a system with high obsolescence risks.
29.   Accommodatin2 the LFR. Under the LFR, the federal government as well as the
state and municipal governments, are required to establish multi-annual (3-years) fiscal
targets upon formulating their annual budget proposals. The LFR also establishes ceilings
on the ratio of personnel expenditures to net revenues. Additionally, the Executive Branch
has submitted to Congress legislative initiatives to establish maximum ratios between net
debt and net current revenues, as well as between gross bonded debt to net current
revenues. These initiatives are expected to be approved. Furthermore, under the LFR the



94
federal and local governments are required to disclose and widely disseminate information
on   public accounts, public debt, budget implementation, and fiscal management
performance, which imposes additional and more effective monitoring than that currently
possible through SIAFI, in particular with respect to its accounting consolidation facilities
whereby the union's consolidated financial statements are prepared.
30.   Accommodatin2 new institutional arrangements for debt mana2ement. While the
functionality of the current SIAFI includes the recording and processing of public debt
transactions, and the automatic posting of accounting entries thereon, the system does not
provide for effective debt management in an environment where new structured debt
models and instruments appear with increasing frequency in the international and domestic
capital markets. The government is presently undertaking a reform of its debt management
systems, as well as specific actions to centralize debt management functions transferring
them to the STN. Among other issues, this implies the development of a more solid debt
informnation system to satisfy the operating requirements of the new back, middle and front
offices for debt management, which implies the replacement SIAFI's current debt
management modules.
31. AccommodatinR new institutional arrangements for asset/liabilitv management.
Similarly, the government is making efforts to gain better control over the recording and
the flow of its assets and liabilities on an integral basis, and effort that will fall under the
purview of the STN. This functionality is not included in the current SIAFI and its
introduction involves the automation of new institutional arrangements within the STN to
manage an assets/liabilities portfolio in the amount of approximately of US$ 185 and 335
billion, respectively.
32.  In summary, these technological and functional considerations strongly support the
notion that the current and aging SIAFI must be replaced with a more modern, flexible, and
functionally upgraded integrated financial management application which properly
addresses the new policies and institutional arrangements for public sector financial
management, and that may also interact more efficiently with other government systems
that use more modem technology.
THE SUFl 21st Century PROPOSAL
33.   Proiect background and mission. Since 1999 the Brazilian federal government is
developing efforts to replace SIAFI with a more advanced system both, functionally and
technologically. This project is known as SIAFI 21St Century, and falls under the
responsibility of the MOF, and in particular the STN. The project's mission has been
defined as "the adequation of SIAFI to the new paradigms of public management, adding
functionalities and promoting the modernization of its technological environment, aiming at
more effectivity in the administration of assets and liabilities of the national treasury, as
well as in the budgetary, financial and patrimonial administration of the federal
government". The SIAFI 21St Century project is expected to be implemented in 3 years,
beginning January 2001. Between 2001 and 2003 the various functional modules or
subsystems of the new SIAFI application will be gradually developed and will be
implemented and become operational as they are completed. Capital investment for



95
hardware and software modernization will take place mainly during the first two years of
the project.
34.   Expected benefits. The project aims at adapting the functionality of SIAFI to the
new financial management model of the federal government, which establishes program-
based multi-annual planning (PPA), and calls for more operational integration between
planning, budgeting, treasury, debt management and asset/liability management, thus
replacing the historical bureaucratic public administration model with a management model
supporting productivity and results. To achieve this, the project would incorporate new
management approaches and techniques that are conceptually absent in the current SIAFI,
such as program-based multi-annual planning; monitoring and evaluation of the physical
and financial execution of the budget from a results-oriented management perspective
rather than only from an accounting perspective; costing of government outputs and
outcomes, enhanced public debt and asset/liability   management; and, improved
accountability at the federal and local government levels. The project also aims at
improving SIAFI's capabilities to interact with other government systems and with other IT
applications and tools used by government managers to perform their daily functions. The
project also aims at modernizing the administration of the STN, providing it with advanced
information management and workflow tools for the control of its operations and
documents.
35.   Specific benefits expected from the SIAFI 21st Century system can be summarized
as follows:
(a) 24 hours per day, seven days per week availability of the system;
(b) Increase and effective maximization of the number of simultaneous users;
(c) Increase in the system's capacity to integrate information and handle large volumes of
data;
(d) Windows-based multi-task environment with graphic user interface and WEB
philosophy;
(e) Friendly interface, in Portuguese;
(f) A system more suited to satisfy the specific needs of each type of user, and providing
user-oriented services, including the availability of spread sheets, word processors, text
editors, graphics and imaging, statistical functions, projections and simulations, help
desk, etc.
(g) Flexibility and agility for user-specified performance of data analysis and of analysis
refinements at various levels of complexity, including facilities for statistical analysis,
projections and scenario simulations;
(h) Significant reduction in maintenance costs, in particular for functional customization
and the incorporation of changes in the legal framework, rules of business,
functionalities, etc.;
(i) On-line documentation and help;
(j) Ease and agility in data entry and retrieval;



96
(k) Increased ease and agility for data export and import;
(1) Enhanced stand-alone capacity in spending units for the entry of transactions and the
local creation of documents;
(m)Availability of flexible training modules, allowing distance-learning by users;

government networks;
(o) Increased system capillarity by more extensive use of internet, outreaching more users
and the general public;
(p) SIAFI 21"t Century internet gate
(q) Accurate accounting of effective expenditure, improving cash management;
(r) Improved financial and physical monitoring of budget execution, including cost
accounting of programs and projects;
(s) Availability of daily balances for all types of transactions and accounts;
(t) Ability to work simultaneously with various fiscal periods and on a context basis;
(u) Ability for non-specialists to retrieve and use information from different management
and analysis perspectives: financial, economic, costing, etc;
(v) Facilities to evaluate management performance, outputs and outcomes;
(w) Integrated registry and management of the treasury's stock and flows of assets and
liabilities;
(x) Facilities to monitor, analyze and project economic indicators and data in the system;
(y) Capacity to monitor compliance of the Law for Fiscal Responsibility by entities at the
federal and local government levels;
(z) Accounting of the fiscal performance of the national treasury;
36.   SIAFI 21't Century - Financial management functionalitv. From a financial
management functionality standpoint, the project is organized in four main areas:
(a) Budgetary, financial and patrimonial administration;
(b) Administration of assets and liabilities;
(c) States and municipalities oversight; and,
(d) Internal administration of the STN.
A summary of the functional breakdown of each of these functional areas is provided in

37.   The development of a SIAFI 21"t Century application will also imply the inclusion
of a number of comrnmon project components, which are defined as those features and tools
of the system serving all other functional subsystems, as is summarized in Box A6.4.

38.   Project preparation activities.  While many of the financial management
processes and business rules are already immersed in the current SIAFI and will be
migrated to the new application, since mid-2000 the STN has formed a number of project
preparation workgroups that are perforrning process and procedures analysis tasks in
various areas. One of these groups is analyzing since august 2000 all the internal workflow
of the treasury for the financial planning of budget execution. Two other groups are
performing similar work since October 2000 in the assets and liabilities and debt
management areas.  In parallel, joint STN/SERPRO  technological workgroups are



99
performing analysis in the system security area and for the selection of design and
development tools. These efforts involve a team of 16 individuals in STN staff and 4
technicians from SERPRO.  Project preparation activities presently include training
programs for STN and SERPRO information technicians in CASE-based design and
development tools that are expected to be used in the project. Three external consultants
are working with SERPRO for the use of RATIONAL development and evaluation tools
and project monitoring tools.
39.   Additionally, SERPRO has formed a team for the selection and homologation of the
information technology platform (h/w, s/w and data base) that will be used for SIAFI 21St
Century, and preliminary proposals are presently being considered.  An structured
technological validation program has been initiated with regard to the three-layer system
architecture being proposed (the data layer; the application layer and the user interface
layer). Pilots for each layer have been developed and tested with the participation of
relevant potential suppliers including Rational, Compuware, Microsoft, Oracle, Sun, IBM,
Silicon Graphics and Compaq. The technological validation program further includes areas
such as: system solutions, integration with other technologies, tools for the administration
and monitoring of the production environment, system escalation and data warehouse
technologies. The results of these validation processes will determine final technological
choices pursuant to further technical and commercial analysis. Strategies for the use of the
chosen technologies and for their implementation are also being developed. System and
access security are critical areas under the validation process, and include among other
the integration of firewalls, the use of SERPRO's virtual private network, and a Web
applications allowing the incorporation of digital signatures. At the end of these processes
SNT and SERPRO intend to seek digital security certification from a widely recognized
certification agency (CA).
40.   Therefore, notwithstanding project implementation did not begin in January 2000 as
originally expected, STN and SERPRO have made significant progress in project
preparation, and the STN expects to complete the technological validation program and
make its final technological choices by the second Quarter of 2001.
41.   As an important part of project preparation activity and technical and financial
schedules for the project have been developed, and funding required for the first year of its
implementation has been included in the 2001 federal budget proposal that Congress is due
to approve by December 15, 2000, thus allowing the beginning of the project in January
2001, which would permit to substantially complete the project by 2003.
42.   Proposed project implementation schedule. Table 7.4.7 summarizes the proposed
2201-2003 project schedule, by Quarter. Subsystems will be implemented and become
operative as their development and the training of users is completed. The three-year life
span of the project is justified by the STN and SERPRO in terms of the time required not
only for the development of the new SIAFI application, but also for the evaluation of
platform alternatives and state-of-the-art technologies; training of IT resources in the use of
new system development technologies and tools, possibly including object-oriented
programming; the introduction of a new system for the management of the project; and,
the  competitive procurement of goods and services for the implementation of the



100
development, homologation and production environments, much of which has to achieved
before actual development and implementation begin.
43.   On the other hand, the implementation schedule of the SIAFI 21St Century project
also takes into account its timely insertion in the government's Brasil Trasparente
program, aiming at increased public expenditure transparency; the need to co-ordinate
actions so that gradual implementation coincides with budget and fiscal cycles; the
convenience of completing the project before the current administration's leaves office in
2003; and, the existing urgency to reduce the technological and financial management risks
represented by the aging current SIAFI system.

Development & implementation
Legend    Training of technicians & users
Production                               -
44.   Project preparation during 2000 included technology evaluation tasks, system
architecture design and training of STN and SERPRO technicians in the use of



101
development tools, which will allow development of the various subsystem from the
beginning of 2001.
45.   The development and implementation of the budget, financial and patrimonial
subsystems is tied to the federal budget preparation schedule, thus the budget planning and
formulation modules will be given development and implementation priority in 2001 so
that they become available by February 2002, in time for training users before the
beginning of the preparation of the 2003 budget proposal. The STN reports that the reason
why the SIAFI 21st Century includes a number of budget formulation and planning
functions which would normally correspond to the MP's budget system, is that the SIDOR
network outreaches to around 700 budget units only, while SIAFI's network expands to
4,560 spending units (UG for Unidades de Gestao or management units), providing them
with system capabilities to undertake basic budgeting functions that supports the MP's
overall budgeting requirements. For the same reason, the new SIAFI modules would also
include modules to register physical execution of the budget at the spending unit level,
catering to information requirements of program managers under the PPA.
46.   Notwithstanding careful planning of the SIAFI 21st Century project, its
implementation schedule remains extremely ambitious, not so much in terms of the
estimated duration of the development of each subsystem, but in terms of the concurrent
development and implementation of two very major subsystems: the budget, financial and
patrimonial subsystem and the assets & liabilities management subsystem, in parallel to the
development of less complex subsystems for local government oversight and for the
internal administration of the STN. In order to mitigate implementation delays, the STN
and SERPRO are planning to assign to the SIAFI-21t Century project technical resources
who are presently operating SIAFI and are thus very familiar with its functionality and day-
to-day operation, with the expectation that this will facilitate and expedite the development
of the new system. As the present SIAFI would continue to operate while the new system
is being developed and operating, the strategy is to hire and train new technical resources
for its operation. Extremely strong and effective overall project management will be
required for the execution and timely completion of the SIAFI- 21St Century project. The
STN is welcoming Bank support in this area under a technical assistance proposal which
would include one top IT expert to advise on technological choices at the initial stage of the
project, one senior consultant to provide project management support throughout the life of
the project and one senior financial management specialist to assist in the integration of
budget and treasury functions. In summary, project execution should be closely monitored
to ensure its successful and timely execution.

47.   Proposed proiect budget and financial schedule. Table A6.4  summarizes the
project's budget between 2001 and 2003. STN officials with whom this budget has been
discussed have expressed the view that it is still a high-level estimation, and that actual
project costs are likely to be significantly lower. The suggestion was made that recent
costing refinements after initial valuation of technological alternatives seem to confirm this
view. On the other hand, in a project of the scope of SIAFI 21 st Century is can be expected
that once the project is underway user demands for additional functionalities and facilities
are likely to result in increased investment and development costs. In the course of the
preparation of this Annex various budget versions were reviewed which showed variations
in a range up to 20% in large certain budget components. The budget versions differed in
terms of cost elements and their grouping, making comparisons and interpretation difficult.
However, the budget provided in Table A6.4 is an adequate working-premise that is close
to what has reportedly been included in the 2001 budget proposal for project infrastructure
and application development.
High development cost
48.   The budgeted costs for the development and implementation of the SIAFI 21 t
Century system appear to be very high in relation to other known Latin-American
experiences for the development of integrated financial management systems. The more
relevant would appear to be the Argentine and Mexican IFMS development projects,
though system and deployment and scopes would no doubt show significant variances. The
budget for SIAFI 21st Century includes US $ 15.3 million solely for the creation of a
development environment in SERPRO, to which additional US $ 15.4 million have been
added for direct application-development costs. At US $ 30.8 million in development and
training costs, before capital investments of US $ 33.4 million for the creation of permanent
production, training, telecommunications and information management environments,
there is no major evidence that the use of SERPRO as technological partner of the project
represents significant cost advantages to the Ministry of Finance. It appears that an
important capitalization of SERPRO has been included in the US $ 64.2 million budget
for the SIAFI 21st Century project, whereas such capitalization could have been treated
separately in order to identify and evaluate direct project costs. Taking these observations
into consideration, the role and cost of SERPRO as the technological partner of the
MOF/STN should perhaps been compared with competitive market alternatives at least for
the application-development stage of the project.  Such analysis falls beyond the scope of
this Annex, thus consideration should be given to independent external validation of the
budget being proposed for the SIAFI 21st Century project. This validation is a possible
component of the TA loan under preparation that will accompany the implementation of the
program supported by the PFRSAL.

49.   In addition to its very high cost, there are a number of other concerns with respect
to the estimated budget of the SIAFI 21 st Century Project:
Financing of the proiect's budget
50.   Reportedly, the 2001 budget proposal being considered by Congress includes
appropriations of approximately US $ 20 million to finance the creation of the
technological infrastructure and the direct development cost of the proposed new SIAFI
applications or subsystems, but does not include the capital investments portion of the
budget, which amounts to more than US $ 33 million. Reportedly, capital investment



104
funding would be raised by STN during project execution by way of additional credits to
be incorporated in the federal budget. Also, SERPRO would reportedly raise its share of
capital expenditures by way of a loan from the federal government or supported by the it.
In fact, more recent version of the project's budget suggests that capital expenditures in the
amount of US $ 34.5 million required for the creation of production-related environments
for SIAFI 21't Century would be distributed between 2001 and 2002, as follows:
Table A6.5 - SIAFI 21st Century - Capital Expenditures budget
Entity               2001            2002            Total

Source: National Treasury (STN)
Rate: US$ l.oo : Reais $ 1.9
51.   By any standard, the scope and the cost of the SIAFI 21st Century are no doubt too
critical and large for the Brazilian government to undertake the risk of initiating the project
without firmly securing its full financing. Otherwise, completion risks for the project
would increase significantly. Considering the tight implementation schedule of the project,
which requires implementation to begin January 2001, it would seem necessary that
immediate actions be taken by the SNT and SERPRO to secure full project financing, in
addition to reviewing the project's budget. Another urgent requirement would be to put in
place no later than the beginning of 2001 an accountable and strong project management
team. Support on project management is one of the areas that would be addresses in the TA
loan currently under preparation.
IMPLEMENTATIONAND COMPLETIONRISKS
52.   Like any large systems development project, SIAFI 21't Century faces important
implementation and completion risks, for which there are a number of equally important
mitigating factors.
53.   Technolo2ical risks. From the technological standpoint, consideration is being
given to models, platforms, environments and development techniques and tools which
represent a dramatic departure from those prevailing since the current SIAFI system was
developed and implemented some 13 years ago. This will have major effects on
information resources both, during project execution and later for post-implementation
maintenance. System users will be migrating from a rigid character mode interface
environment to a graphic mode Windows and internet environments. System availability
for 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, while being a benefit, will also represent work
scheduling challenges both for information resources and users.
54.   However, technological risks are mitigated by the careful approach being taken by
both, the STN and SERPRO in terms of validating technological alternatives and choices
through extensive pilot testing at each of the three proposed system layers (data, application
and user interface) with the support of external consultants and the participation of potential



105
suppliers of goods and services. Other mitigating factors include current training of
information resources in the use of the design and development tools that will be used in
the construction of applications, as well as plans to provide extensive training to users of
the systems before the various subsystems become operational. Another consideration is
that while the technology being considered is new in a SIAFI environment, there is
substantial successful experience with it, both internationally and in Brazil. Finally,
SERPRO has a very solid and long standing experience as a developer and operator of
government systems in Brazil, including the development of the current SIAFI system and
its operation during the past 13 years, thus it is familiar with the Brazilian legal framework
and rules of the business for public sector financial management at all federal government
levels.
55.   Political and financing risks. The risk of changes in political priorities are always
higher in the case of multi-annual projects requiring high levels of investment.
Technological and/or financial risks may materialize producing delays and cost overruns in
project implementation which could result in a loss of political favor and completion
funding. Coordination between project completion and the budgeting and financial
schedules may be lost because of technological or funding delays, resulting in project
implementation breakdowns. General economic and financial conditions may force a
government to cut down on new and ongoing projects, specially when they are as large as
the new SIAFI project. A new administration may decide to pursue a different approach for
a project that has a high-profile incidence over government management systems,
transparency and accountability.
56.   Notwithstanding these and other completion risks, the SIAFI 21st Century project is
being proposed not only as a much needed technological development in view of the
increasing obsolescence of the current SIAFI, but it is also supported on major policy
actions, such as the PPA and the Fiscal Responsibility Law (LRF), which are key
components of the current administration's program. The project is scheduled to be
completed during the current administration's term in office. Being instrumental to
facilitate monitoring and evaluation of performance under the PPA and the LRF, it is likely
to remain funded until completion, though implementation delays taking completion
beyond the current administration's term could have less predictable effects. The support
being provided by the Bank to PPA and LRF implementation can also be considered as a
completion risk mitigating factor. The project's implementation schedule is based on the
gradual completion and implementation of its various subsystems and modules, thus there
is built-in flexibility to establish development priorities in coordination with budgeting and
financial fiscal year schedules. The fact that subsystems or modules of the current SIAFI
will continue operating as needed during the implementation of the project substantially
mitigates the risk of breakdowns in financial management if the project faces delays or
completion problems.
57.   In summnary, while SIAFI 21st Century faces the various types of implementation
and completion risks inherent to a project of its type and scope, there are also important
mitigating factors that support its viability, among which stand out the sound approach
reportedly being taken by STN and SERPRO for the validation of technological alternatives
and the fact that the project falls within the framework of major international agency



106
supported policy initiatives such as the PPA and the LRF. In order to further mitigate
project risks, a similar approach should be evidenced in relation of the financial validation
of the project.
SUSTAINABILITYOFSIAFI21sf CENTURY
58.   Once in place, the new SIAFI system can be expected to have stronger long-term
sustainability, as it its technological environment will be state-of-the-art from its very
beginning compared to the current SIAFI system which was developed with technology
that at the time was about to complete its expected life cycle. There are three main types of
arguments for this appraisal:
(a) Technological;
(b) Management culture; and,
(c) Legal, policy and institutional arrangements framework
59.   Technological considerations. The proposed distinct three-layer architecture (data
base, application and user interface) of the new system will largely facilitate the
introduction of new technologies at each level as they become available, without a general
disruption of the system as a whole, which is a major problem that the current SIAFI is
presently confronting. The proposed use of CASE-based design and development and a
graphic Windows environment will result in an application that can be easily adapted to
future changes in financial management legislation, processes and other institutional
arrangements, in particular if advanced application customization capabilities and tools are
incorporated in its design..
60.   Manag-ement culture. From a functional perspective, Brazil has accumulated 13
years of integrated financial management experience supported in the widespread use of
SIAFI by all federal government spending units. An administrative culture for IT-based
fmancial management has been developed and is firmly established, supporting the
expectation that the new SIAFI will be sustainable as a system.
61.   Legal, policy and institutional arrangements framework   As previously
mentioned the updating of SIAFI is not being proposed solely in response to the growing
technological obsolescence of the current system, but principally in order to adapt the
system to major changes that are taking place under Brazil's far reaching fiscal reform
program. SIAFI 21st Century will specifically address the monitoring and evaluation
requirements of the PPA and the LRF, as well as the introduction of new permanent
institutional arrangements for enhanced public debt management and federal government
asset/liability management.  The new system will be one of the major sources of
information for program managers under the PPA, and will specifically monitor federal and
local governments compliance with the fiscal transparency requirements of under the LRF.
New institutional arrangements for public debt management and asset/liability management
will be specifically addressed in the new system both, from an information standpoint as
well as for operations. Therefore, not being an stand-alone technological project but being



107
intimately immersed in the framework of major fiscal reform developments, it is
reasonable to expect that SIAFI 215t Century will be a sustainable long-range proposition.
EXPECTED BENEFITS AND IMPACT OF THE SIAFI 21s' CENTURY PROPOSAL
62.   As for the assessment of its sustainability, the benefits and the impact of the SIAFI
21"t Century project can also be established in terms of:
(a) Technology;
(b) Management culture and practice; and,
(c) Legal, policy and institutional arrangements framework; and,
(d) Linkage and interaction with other systems.
63.   Technoloieical benefits and impact. In addition to specific benefits discussed in
section 4.2 of this Annex, the proposed SIAFI 21st Century project will have four major
technological benefits and impacts: (a) it will neutralize the serious risks implied in the
growing obsolescence of the current SIAFI, which may cause not only technological
breakdowns and high maintenance costs, but also related potential breakdowns of a fiscal
management system largely reliant on IT operational support; (b) the new technology will
increase the operating efficiency of the IT and telecommunications platforms; (c) the new
technology will greatly facilitate adaptation of the system to new legal and operating
requirements, as well as the addition and integration of new financial management
functions; and, (d) linkage with other more modern government systems, such as SIDOR
and SIG will be greatly enhanced.
64.   Manai-ement culture and practice benefits and impact. The passage from a
system developed in aging programming languages and character mode technology to a
system developed for a Windows environment with strong graphic capabilities will no
doubt have a major positive impact in operations at large and in management efficiency
and effectiveness, making the retrieval and handling of information much more friendly,
faster, flexible, agile and efficient. It will permit to transform SIAFI into a true managerial
system, rather than remaining mostly an information processing and storage system. The
new environment will facilitate the integration of peripheral software to support additional
management functions at a level that not even the managerial version of SIAFI, tied to a
less flexible operating environment, can achieve today. Customization functions allowed
by the new technology will permit managers to adapt the system's outputs to their specific
information needs, which should also have an important positive impact con management
culture and practice.
65.   Legal, policy and institutional arrangements framework and impact. As the
design and development of the SIAFI 21St Century application will include functionalities
directly related to PPA, LRF, asset liability/management, local government monitoring and
STN operations, it will have very positive impact on the implementation of the relative
legal and policy frameworks, as well as on institutional arrangements thereon, both as a
source of customized information and as a management tool.



108
66.   Linkage with other systems. A number of key government systemns, including
SIDOR and SIG were developed several years after the original development of SIAFI,
thus using more modern technology. This results in limitations for the exchange of
information and reduces the potential and the scope of operating integration of the
government's financial management systems. The technological and functional upgrading
proposed under the SIAFI 21t Century project will not only facilitate the development of
more flexible, agile and efficient links, but provides the opportunity to incorporate many
such links into the new system's design, in particular in what relates to more integration to
SIDOR and SIG, which with SIAFI are the cornerstones of the Brazilian new financial
management system. It will also improve the support to SFC fiscalization and audit
activities. Navigation in the new SIAFI system for purposes such as internal and external
audit as well as to provide information to the general public as part of public sector
transparency initiatives, will also be greatly facilitated.
CONSISTENCY WITH LESSONS LEARNED AND INTERNATIONAL
EXPERIENCES
67.   The SIAFI 21st CENTURY proposal is largely consistent with lessons learned in
Brazil in relation to the management of large governmental information systems, as well as
with international experiences in relation to the normal life cycle of integrated financial
management applications in the public sector.
68.   An important lesson learned is that systems have to be flexible to accommodate
various types of users, and that their technology must permit adaptation without major
structural changes or programming to new legal and policy environments and to ever
changing institutional arrangements. A large centralized mainframe system like the current
SIAFI, accessible mainly by terminals does not provide these facilities. Because of this, the
"management version" of SIAFI had to be eventually implemented and there is not
adequate and efficient integration between its original and more recent subsystems. These
and other lessons are being taken into account for the design and development of the new
SIAFI 21st Century.
69.   The normal life span of IFMS systems in Latin-American countries comparable to
Brazil y size and complexity of their federal systems has been much less than SIAFI's 13
years in operation. The Argentine SIDIF system was developed around 1992 also using
computing languages and environments that even then were close to obsolescence. SIDIF
was subject to comprehensive technological and functional modernization in the late
nineties, including the development of institutional or "local" SIDIF version to be
implemented in ministries and other entities finances with federal budget resources. In the
case of Mexico, the SIAF application developed and implemented in the federal treasury
department in the early nineties has been recently replaced by a new, more modern version.
Therefore, the modernization of SIAFI is in line with processes observed in other
comparable countries in the region, and is even past due by some 4 to 5 years.
70.   From a functional standpoint, new IFMS systems are normally developed, as will be
the case for SIAFI 215t Century, with stronger debt management facilities, improvements in
telecommunications support, including the use of internet by financial management units



109
and providing more access to civil society organizations and the general public, reflecting
increase demands for government transparency.
71.   However, from a financial standpoint the project's budget does not seem to be in
line with international experiences observed in countries such as Argentina and Mexico,
though in order to confirm this assessment, more pointed comparative analysis would be
required in areas such as the comparative  deployment of the systems and their
technological and functional scopes. Also, the project's proposed budget should be further
validated as discussed above.
THE BRAZILL4 NAUDIT PROCESS
72.   External and internal control and audit are necessary complements of sound
financial management, program management and accountability, thus it is important to
review the relevant control and audit processes when discussing and evaluating SIAFI, the
PPA and the LRF.
73.   At the federal level, external control and audit in Brazil is the responsibility of the
Tribunal de Contas da Uniao (TCU), which follows a tribunal organizational and
functional structure rather than that of an office of the comptroller general (OCG) as in
several Latin American countries. Internal control and audit within the federal executive
falls under the Federal Internal Control System (SCI) and its governing body the Secretaria
Federal de Control (SFC) of the MOF.
External control and audit
74.   Governing body. The TCU seats in Brasilia, and is integrated by 9 magistrates or
ministers, six being appointed by Congress and three by the Executive Branch. Two of the
magistrates selected by the Executive Branch must be either auditors or public prosecutors
of the TCU. The TCU is organized like a court of law in a plenary and two chambers, each
of these being integrated by four ministers and one or two auditors, depending on the
characteristics of each case. The TCU is supported by five technical units or secretariats,
including one for external control and another for internal control.  The other three
technical units handle administration, the TCU's session schedule, and auditing training.
Under the co-ordination of the secretary for external control, the five technical secretaries
of the TUC integrate a permanent consultative commission which supports the TCU's
magistrates in matters related to the planning, organization and methods, human resources
administration, budget, patrimony, and technology pertaining the TCU. The federal
Constitution provides for an specialized and autonomous public prosecution office
(Ministerio Publico) within the TCU's organic structure, integrated by an attorney general,
three deputy attorney generals and four attorneys appointed by the Executive Branch, with
responsibility for the defense of public order, the economic interests of the state, and to
procure justice. The Ministerio Publico can also express opinion on all matters brought
before the TCU.



110
75.   Legal framework and functional responsibilities of the TCU.  The federal
Constitution establishes that the TCU has functional responsibilities for the evaluation
fiscalization and audit of:
* The annual accounts of the executive;
* The accounts of administrators and other parties responsible for public monies, goods
and assets;
* The legality of acts whereby public sector staff is hired and retirement conditions are
granted, as well as reforms to civil and military pensions;
* The accounts of state companies;
* The application of federal revenues transferred to states and municipalities, including
the federal district;
* The application of subsidies and the waiving of revenues in the public sector;
76.   The Constitution also provides for the following actions to be performed by the
TCU:
* The application of sanctions and the correction of legal violations and irregularities in
public acts and contracts;
- Provide information to Congress on its fiscalization actions;
- At the request of Congress, issue a conclusive pronouncement on non-authorized public
sector expenditures;
- Process accusations made by citizens, political parties, associations or unions on legal
violations and irregularities in the public sector;
-  Fix the coefficients for the distribution or participations of federal revenues to states,
the federal district and municipalities, and fiscalize their transfer to the local
governments.
77.   Additionally, the organic law of the TCU (Law nbr. 8443, July 16, 1992 and its
subsequent reforms) establishes the following main responsibilities:
* Resolve consultations made by government authorities about the application of legal or
statutory norms in any area under the TCU's purview;
* Control the legality of the assets and revenues of government authorities and public
servants;
* Evaluate the privatization of public enterprises included in the national decentralization
program;
* Evaluate representations made by participants in government bidding processes about
irregularities in the application of the federal procurement law (Lei de Licitacoes e
Contratos);
* Evaluate representations made by municipal authorities about irregularities in the
transfer of federal revenues earmarked to local governments.



II1
The organic law of the TCU and its internal estatutes (Regimento Interno do TCU, June
15, 1993) and its many subsequent reforms, establish in detail the scope of each
fiscalization action, including basic norms for external control, including the
performance at the TCU's own initiative, the performance of formal inspections and
external audits.   The TCU's organic law also defines the framework for internal
control and audits, pursuant to constitutional provisions.
78.   Institutional arrangements for external control and audit. Within the TCU, its
technical secretariat for external control (SECEX) is in charge of fiscalization and audit. In
turn, SECEX is internally supported by technical units specializing in the planning and
management of the fiscalization and audit processes, in the execution of control actions and
audits, and in information technology. The TCU has 37 external controls and audit
administration units throughout the country, operating under the purview of its technical
secretariat for external control (SECEX). 26 of these units are located in state capitals,
while 11 operate in Brasilia. They are responsible for all inspection work inherent to
external control and for the performance of formal audits. More specifically, of the units
located in Brasilia, 7 monitor accounts and management actions and perform formal
external audits in assigned groups of federal entities, three are in charge of specialized
control areas, such as civil service, pensions and government decentralization including
privatizations, government accounts, transfers of revenues to local governments and
government revenues, and the remaining unit supports the administration of processes
brought to the attention of the TCU. Units in state capitals perform external control and
audit functions that are relevant at the state level, and are also responsible for the
fiscalization of the application of public resources by municipal governments and other
state and municipal entities. The TCU also has a training branch (Instituto Serzedello
Correa), who supports the human resource recruitment and the technical development of
auditors and develops research activities in the control and audit area.
Internal control and audit
79.   Governing body. The Secretaria Federal de Controle (SFC) is responsible for the
federal government's Internal Control System (SCI). SFC was created in April 1994, under
the MOF. Article 74 of the federal constitution provides for the establishment of the SCI
and assigns it the following functions:
*  Evaluating compliance with the targets of the multi-annual plan (PPA) in relation to the
execution of the government's prograrns and the federal budget;
*  Establishing the legality and validate results in relation to efficiency and effectiveness
of budgetary, financial and patrimonial management in all federal administration
entities, as well as in relation to the application of public resources by civil entities;
*  Controlling credit operations, including guarantees, as well as assets and liabilities of
the union; and,
* Providing support to external control activities both, through the performance of audits,
issuing audit reports and certifications, and through formal requests to administrative
authorities to undertake special audits whenever  illegalities or irregularities are
observed.



112
80.   More recently, the federal government has updated the framework of the SCI by
way of Decree Nbr. 3.591, of September 6, 2000, which   redefines its  functional,
organizational and jurisdictional structures, and also establishes rules and standards on a
number of specific, general and transitory internal control issues. While the Constitutional
purposes of the SCI remain unchanged, the following internal control activities are
specified in the new Decree:
* Evaluation of compliance with the program  targets established in the PPA and of its
execution;
* Evaluation of the execution of the government's programs, to determine the level of
execution of their respective targets, the achievement of outputs and outcomes, and
management performance;
* Evaluation of the execution of the federal budgets, in order to determine compliance
with the limits and appropriations established by applicable legislation;
* Evaluation of the performance of federal public administrators, in order to determine
the legality of their actions and to evaluate results in terms of economy, efficiency and
effectiveness of budgetary, financial, patrimonial and human resources mnanagement,
and other administrative and operating systems;
* Control of credit and guarantee operations, as well as operations related to the Union's
rights and assets, in order to establish their consistency and their compliance with
internal controls;
81.   Internal control activities have also been redefined as being supportive of public
sector management at all levels, as well as of enhancements in the formulation, planning,
coordination, execution and monitoring of public policies. The mentioned decree also lists
with considerable detail specific control and audit responsibilities of the SFC. The new
framework also redefines ties between the SIC and the external control system under the
purview of the TCU.
82.   By way of these new functional definitions, the new internal control framework has
been aligned with other government management initiatives, and in particular with the
objectives of the PPA and the LRF.
83.   Institutional arranaements for  internal control and audit.  The overall
responsibility for the SIC remains with the SFC, which is defined as the central organ of the
system, with normative and technical oversight authority over internal control audit in the
federal Executive Branch. The September 2000 decree also provides for Internal Control
Secretariats (CISET) at the presidency, the attorney general's office, the foreign affairs
ministry and the defense ministry, defining them as sectorial organs. The internal control
units of military commands are defined as sectorial units of the CISET of the ministry of
defense, and the regional internal control units (GRCI) of state governments are defined as
regional units of the SFC.  Both, the SFC and the CISET may establish regional and
sectorial units. A Commission for the Coordination of Internal Control (CCCI), is
responsible for promoting the integration and the harmonization of criteria on matters under
the SCI's purview and for the evaluation of activities under the SCI. The CCI is chaired
by the SFC and its membership includes the heads of the sectorial units. There are



113
important changes in the organization and focus of SFC, partly prompted by the September
2000 decree. From the organizational standpoint (i) all internal control work has been
centralized in five program audit units (Diretorias de Auditoria de Programas), based on
the Executive Branch's main action areas: economic, social, infrastructure, human
resources and administration, and a unit for the management of the SCI (Diretoria de
Gestdo do Sistema de Controle Interno), and (ii) all internal audit units of federal ministries
and agencies in Brasilia have been closed-down and fiscalization resources have been
concentrated in the SFC headquarters in order to streamline operational efficiency and
effectiveness. The SFC is also focusing internal control and audit work on the evaluation
of public policies, in a process based on the analysis of the federal budget from the
perspective of PPA programs, in order to define internal control and audit strategies and
operating plans for each program in terms of types and frequency of fiscalization actions.
While it is perhaps too early to assess this new approach to internal control, it is no doubt
consistent with other major policy developments, in particular the PPA and the LRF.

strategic planning and specific Quarterly control and audit targets for each of its regional
and sectorial units. Table A6.6 provides an indication of the scope of SFC operations since
its creation in 1994.

85.   SFC's fiscalization programs cover a large cross-section of public sector activities,
involving approximately 1,100 auditable government entities and 110 programs funded
with external resources. It has a total staff of approximately 1,400, 85% of which with
audit and fiscalization functions. It is presently in the process of hiring 200 more auditors,
with the aim of fulfilling its estimated total operational requirement of 1,800 to 2,000
employees. While fiscalization activities ranging from formal audits to continuous
monitoring of government actions in key areas, remains the main thrust of the internal
control process, the SFC also plays a role in the restructuring of federal organizations; debt
securitization and debt assumptions by the federal government; evaluation of government



114
programs (which show and increase from 1,556 fiscalization actions in 1995 to 4,952 in
1998); fiscalization of bidding and other procurement processes at the federal, state and
municipal levels; monthly accounting analysis of approximately 600 management units;
integration in SIAFI of the monthly financial statements of states and of municipalities of
state capitals; integration in SIAFI of the annual financial statements of approximately
5,000 municipalities; monitoring and audit of compliance under contracts and agreements
between the federal government and state, municipal and civil society entities receiving
federal funding; monitoring and auditing of government payroll and pension expenditures;
and accounting audits of external loans and grants, where the SFC acts as external auditors
on behalf of international agencies including the World Bank, IADB, U.S. EXIMBANK,
UNDP, KFW, FAO, OIMT and others. On the basis of its fiscalization work, the SFC
monitors and prepares situation reports on 16 sectors or areas: agriculture; federal
administration and state reform; science and technology; communications; culture;
education; fiscal; industry, trade and tourism; justice; environment; mining and energy;
planning and budgeting; social security; health; labor; and transportation.
86.   Information systems used for internal control. SFC operations are supported by
an information system known as ATIVA, used for the planning, administration and control
of the execution of audit and other fiscalization activities. ATIVA is a multifunction
software package developed by SERPRO for the SCF which is used for: managing the
information systems (h/w, s/w, telecommunications and IT resources) of the SFC; plan and
monitor the execution SFC's audit and fiscalization processes; evaluating and monitoring
the performance of audit and fiscalization staff with the support of a specialized subsystem
know as SALVA (for variable logistic evaluation system); providing electronic mail
services to users; producing standardized management reports to monitor accounting results
in government agencies and programs subject to fiscalization; providing on-line
information of legislation relevant o fiscalization processes and the SFC's technical audit
and fiscalization manuals; monitoring governmental human resources processes, including
audit and fiscalization training provided; providing management reports on the results and
certifications granted pursuant to audits and other fiscalization actions. ATIVA is linked
SIAFI. Aside from recording in SIAFI the budgetary and financial execution of the SFC,
ATIVA includes a module (AUDITAR) which performs "paperless" audits, as well as
another module (SIGECONV) and uses SIAFI outputs to audit the compliance of contracts
between the federal government and states, municipalities, foundations and other entities
benefiting from government funding. ATIVA has various other subsystems that support
fiscalization management: SIAR - for the identification and analysis of areas in the federal
government representing internal control risks; WINSAPE - allowing users to schedule
fiscalization and audit staff according to their own requirements; PRESTACONTA -
which supports the automation of the SFC activities, making available audit reports, audit
certifications, audit recommendations and pronouncements by internal control units and
ministries, also supporting the TCU's evaluation of public managers; and, SALVA which
monitors the performance of auditors and other fiscalization staff. From a technological
standpoint ATIVA operates in a mainframe environment serving a network of terminals in
its operating units in Brasilia and 23 state capitals, allowing the monitoring and verification
of SFC activities throughout the country.

Generalfiscalization conditions and links between the external and internal control
areas
87.   Conversations with SFC suggest that while the more developed state governments
and their metropolitan municipalities, mostly in South-East of the country, have modern,
strong, and auditable financial management and accounting systems, critical deficiencies
are still observed in these areas in the North-East and the interior, both at the state and the
municipal government levels. This situation can only be redressed over the long term.
However, federal financial management and accounting shows a more positive and
balanced situation and outlook because of the widespread SIAFI and SIDOR networks.
88.   All SFC audit and other fiscalization reports are made available to the TCU, and
also submitted to Congress and federal authorities as required. Conversations with SFC
suggest that there are strong institutional and operational ties with TCU, that is, between the
external and the internal systems.
89.   Though there is no direct linkage between the systems operated by fiscalization
agencies and the budgeting and financial management system of the MOP and the MOF,
SFC auditors have on-line access to the SIAFI and SIDOR systerns for the performance of
their fiscalization fimctions. It is expected that the same type of access will be available in
the future for SIG, the relatively new PPA program management system.

ANNEX 7: DEBT MANAGEMENT INSTITUTrIONS
1.    This annex reviews federal debt trends and debt policies in Brazil, with particular
attention to Brazil's recent innovations regarding debt management institutions. The first section
provides the background on recent trends and policies. The Second section focuses on the issues
and challenges that Brazil's debt management policies are facing. The importance of Brazil's
debt as a policy issue is highlighted by the fact that Brazil's net public sector debt grew from
28.5 percent of GDP in 1995 to 46.5 percent in 2000 and that much of this debt is short term
debt. In addition, a rapidly changing operating environment characterized by increased reliance
on market sources for financing, greater exposure to financial risks resulting from financial
liberalization, and larger international capital flows also places a stronger challenge on debt
management institutions and policies. These challenges became particularly evident by the
international attention paid to Brazil's debt structure as a source of vulnerability in late 1998, and
the decision to shift from exchange rate targeting to inflation targeting in the first half of 1999.
Since March 1999, there has been a rapid evolution in debt policies that is addressing the new
challenges under the new monetary policy environment.
BACKGROUND
2.    By September 2000, net public sector debt had increased to $548 billion (or 48.5 percent
of GDP), from R$ 269 billion in December 1996 (33 percent of GDP). The net debt of the
federal government constituted 29.4 percent of GDP, the net debt of state and local governments
constituted 16.7% percent of GDP (mostly state governments), and that of state-owned
enterprises, 2.4 percent (mostly from public enterprises at the state level. Net public sector debt
is calculated by subtracting liquid financial assets from liabilities in the consolidated balance
sheet of the public sector, which is standard practice when referring to the Brazilian sovereign
debt position.
3.    Net public sector debt is the sum of net internal and external liabilities, where net internal
liabilities include the monetary base. Net internal debt constituted 37.0 percent of GDP, while
net external debt was 9.5 percent. Over time, the share of net public sector domestic debt
relative to net external debt has increased. Domestic debt comprised 66 percent of total debt in
January 1997, but increased to 78 percent in December 1998. Despite the devaluation in January
1999, the relative shares, as of June 2000, have remained at this level.
4.    Gross federal securities outstanding in the domestic market in June 2000, excluding
Treasury securities held by the Central Bank, amounted to R$504.5 billion or 43 percent of
GDP. The total stock of federal securities has increased substantially since 1993, reflecting
increased financing costs due to higher interest rates, assumption of state debts, and
recapitalization of state-owned banks.
5.    The total National Treasury debt, which excludes Central Bank debt, was R$553.4 billion
in June 2000, of which domestic debt was R$425.1 billion (77%) and external debt was R$128.3
billion (23%). The external debt was composed of bonded debt of R$92.6 billion and contractual
debt of R$35.7 billion. The bonded debt included Brady bonds worth R$60.0 billion.
Contractual debt includes loans from multilateral agencies.

6.    The following subsections give further background information on debt management
policy since the Real Plan, current institutional and legal framework for debt management, and
current organizational arrangements for debt management.
7.    Debt Management Policy Since the Real Plan. After achieving price stability in 1994,
the Treasury authorities' medium-term objective was to increase the maturity and duration of the
liability portfolio by increasing the share of fixed-coupon securities, but the speculative attack of
October 1997 compelled the Central Bank to raise interest rates substantially, thereby imposing a
capital loss on the holders of longer-maturity fixed-rate debt and consequently reducing demand
for these securities.
8.    After a brief period of issuing floating rate instruments at the end of 1997, the Treasury
was able to resume the issuance of fixed-rate securities as domestic interest rates returned to the
pre-crisis level in the first quarter of 1998, but the Russian crisis in August 1998 provoked a
fuirther, more extended speculative attack, resulting in a return to high interest rates. In response
to these various shocks, the share of fixed-rate instruments declined from 55.6 percent in May
1998 to 3.5 percent of federal securities in the market in December 1998, while floating rate
instruments increased to 69.1 percent and dollar-indexed instruments rose to 21 percent by the
same date. The January 1999 devaluation pushed the latter share to 30.4 percent in January
1999.
9.    The changes in the debt structure by instrument (Table A7. 1) had a substantial effect on
the duration of the portfolio, increasing its exposure interest rate risks. However the refinancing
risk did not increase in similar proportion because the Treasury extended the average maturity of
the portfolio using long-term floaters ( 3 and 5 years).

10.   On the external front, the long period of debt negotiation with the commercial banks and
the Paris Club concluded in 1993, resulting in the issuance of Brady bonds and opening a new
era of relationship with the commercial sources. Since then the government has actively
increased the share of financing from external sources relative to domestic sources, but the
government also continued to issue relatively modest amounts of bonds in key international



118
markets in order to facilitate the access of private issuers to these markets. Like other Latin
borrowers, it has also been involved in the restructuring of its Brady debt.
11.   Institutional and Legal Framework for Debt Management The Central Bank was the
main institution that managed the public external debt in Brazil up until 1986 when the transfer
of debt management responsibilities from the Central Bank to the Treasury began with the
establishment of the STN within the Treasury. Under the new arrangement, the STN was to be
responsible for the administration of both internal and external debt. The Treasury is therefore
legally responsible for making the ultimate decisions regarding the issuance, issue size, maturity,
timing and characteristics of the Treasury securities.
12.   But despite the legal transfer of debt management responsibilities from the Central Bank
to the Treasury, the Central Bank continued to be an important issuer of federal securities in the
domestic market due to its monetary policy objectives, and it continued to influence the
administration of the public debt. In addition, the actual transfer of responsibilities for external
debt management from the Central Bank to the Treasury has proceeded very slowly. The Central
Bank continues to manage the government's access to the international capital market as well as
the dialogue with the lenders involved in the Brady bonds and Paris Club negotiations because of
the complexity and sensitivity of the issues at stake and the existent capacity in the Central Bank.
Nevertheless, the Treasury continues to build its capacity on debt management in order to
eventually assume the responsibilities, but progress has been slow.
13.   Adding to the disperse institutional arrangement, several government agencies are also
involved in the management of loans linked to projects, some of which are from multilateral and
bilateral agencies. Because such loans have different dynamics compared to the typical Treasury
operation in the international markets, currently the Treasury has only a marginal involvement in
these loans. Instead, COFIEX, a committee which has a representative from the Ministry of
Planning as its secretariat, authorizes of these loans.  Because these decisions are made
separately by COFIEX, assessment and authorization of project based loans have a tendency to
be made independent of a financial assessment of the overall debt management policy. At the
operational level, each of the Ministries and the Financial Policy Unit of the Ministry of Finance
act as implementing agencies. They are responsible for budgeting, accounting and payment of
these loans, thus multiplying the number of back offices involve in the management of this debt.
14.   The current legal framework is comprised by a set of decrees and resolutions that
separately deal with the external and internal debt, as described in Box A7.1 below. Existing
legislation lacks a clear statement of objectives for debt management although there are rather
implicit references to some of these objectives in some of these legal vehicles. In particular,
Decree 3366 of 2000 defines the roles of the Treasury and Senate resolution 57/95 authorizes the
government to borrow in the international markets and explicitly allows the government to
borrow externally to pay back domestic debt only if the debt will be cheaper. Nevertheless, there
is little or no explicit reference to cost/risk objectives.



119
Box A7.1 - Legal Framework for Debt Management
Public debt issuance by the National Treasury must be programued in the Federal Budget,
specifically observing the following legislation:
* LFR - Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal (Law of Fiscal Responsibility), establishes long term
fiscal sustainability planning.
* LDO - Lei de Diretrizes Oreamentarias (Budget Guidelines Law), establishes guidelines for
debt issuance.
* LOA - Lei Orcamentaria Anual (Annual Budget Law), sets the debt issuance ceiling.
The legal framework is defined separately between external and domestic debt.
For external debt the legal framework is defined by:
* Resolution SF no 57/95 and 51/97, set the limits (USS10 billion) and conditions for issuing
bonds (proceeds must be used to retire internal debt) in the international capital markets.
*  Resolution SF no. 69/96, authorizes buyback and structured traw tions involving external
debt.
For domestic debt the legal fmework is defined by:
* Medida Provisoria no. 1697-57/29.07.98, describes general terms and conditions of the
public debt instruments manaWed by the National Treasury.
* Decreto no. 2701/30.07.98, establishes the characteristics of each instrunent issued by the
Treasury.
Partaria no. 189 de 03/08/98, delegates to the Treasury Secretary the auority for debt issuance redemption and
debt swaps.
15.   Oreanizational Arrangements.  Currently the organizational arrangement for debt
management is split between two government institutions, the STN within the Ministry of
Finance and the Central Bank (Table A7.2). The relevant divisions within the STN are as
follows:
* General Coordination of Foreign Affairs (COREX) - in charge of external debt
* General Coordination of Public Debt Management (CODIP) - in charge of domestic debt
* General Coordination of Contingent Liabilities Restructuring (COARP) - in charge of
contingent liabilities
The organizational structure of the STN has instances of overlap. For example, each of the
external and internal departments has an operational or back office unit and a unit responsible for
analytical work. In addition, the structure could benefit from more specialization in the tasks
typically performed by a modem treasury organization.
16.  In the Central Bank the relevant departments in debt management are:
* Department of Open Market Operations (DEMAB) - conduct of monetary policy and
domestic debt issuance
* Foreign Capital Department (FIRCE) - negotiation of new external borrowing



120
* International Relations Department (DERIN) - negotiations of restructuring of external
borrowing
In addition, the Central Bank manages international reserves through:
* Department of International Reserves Operations (DEPIN)
17.    The Central Bank executes transactions for the Treasury, including auctions for new
issues, and payments of principal and interest. It also evaluates proposals for debt restructuring,
such as buy-back programs, and acts as the front office permanently in communication with the
market, receiving proposals from investment banks. The Central Bank is also the manager of the
SELIC, or the Electronic Clearance and Custody System, through which Treasury auctions are
carried out and settled.40  In effect, the Central Bank performs the settlement functions for all
liabilities, as well as front, middle and back office functions for all external liabilities. The
Central Bank also manages foreign reserves.

11. Foreign Capital Department - new external borrowing
12. International Relations Department - restructuring of external borrowing
13. Open Market Operations Department - primary issuance of Central Bank instruments and repo and outright
transactions of Central Bank and Treasury instruments in secondary market
18.    One important aspect of the current organizational structure is the limited presence of a
middle office which typically is responsible for analyzing the debt portfolio structure. The
portfolio analysis and planning activities that do take place in Brazil appear to be relatively
limited in scope, piecemeal, ad hoc, and limited in circulation. The underlying talent and
knowledge of many of the professionals in both the STN and the Central Bank, however, suggest
that the basic capabilities are in place to allow significant progress to be achieved, even within
existing institutional arrangements. The limited nature of current middle-office type activity
40 See Barbosa (1997) "Public Debt Management: The Recent Brazilian Experience 1995-1997", STN.



121
within the Brazilian debt management is one of the issues that recent reforms are beginning to
address.
ISSUES
19.   The current structure of the sovereign debt exposes the general budget to financial risks
and is a source of fiscal vulnerability to the economy that requires special attention from debt
managers and policy makers. Addressing these risks and vulnerability requires a professional
and comprehensive approach to debt management that involves changes in the policy framework
and in the institutional and analytical framework, as well as a substantial upgrade of debt
management capabilities in the STN.
20.   Policy framework. In order to achieve medium-term stability, a debt management
objective should be to minimize the volatility of the real interest rate paid on the debt, since it is
this parameter which most directly affects debt dynamics. Any benchmark that is developed
relevant for the next few years is likely to have this objective at its core. Large, unanticipated
increases in real interest payments will be perceived as forcing the government away from its
medium-term debt: GDP trajectory. Unanticipated increases in the real interest bill will also
have an immediate impact on other elements of domestic expenditure, which are already under
stress. Little relief is to be expected from the current government revenue-raising capacity
constraints.
21.   With a high percentage of domestic debt maturing in the short term and a high proportion
of floating rate securities relative to fixed rate securities, pursuit of the objective described above
means moving toward a more even distribution of maturities and an increased use of fixed-rate
instruments. A situation where the government fails to rollover the debt or, more accurately,
faces an unacceptably high price for refinancing at an inopportune moment can lead to financial
vulnerability. Accordingly, quantifying and managing refinancing risk is a priority, even though,
as the authorities point out, refinancing debt in the domestic market has not so far been a
problem. The point is rather that the concentration of maturities is seen by markets as a sign of
vulnerability which becomes an element in the country risk premium and raises funding costs.
Also the costs of any perceived failure to rollover debt are large, a situation that must be avoided.
22.   The normal mechanism for dealing with refinancing risk at an acceptable cost is to issue
medium- and long-term floating rate bonds. The maturity could be extended even if duration is
not, by testing the market for longer-dated (3, 5 and 7-year) floating-rate instruments. The
underlying goal must be to deal with the refinancing and interest rate risks one at a time, by first
reducing refinancing risk to a more tolerable level and thereafter reducing the interest rate risk.
By issuing large issues, the increase in liquidity can compensate for the premium demanded by
the market for longer dated securities. A concurrent program to change the reset interval for the
coupon, from the current 1 day to 3 months, and then to 6 months, could be implemented to
extend duration.
23.   In addition to the repricing risk at rollover on fixed-rate instruments, interest rate risk is
also significant on a continuous basis, as there has been an increasing concentration of floating
rate instruments in the current debt structure. The floating rate instruments, particularly the
LFTs (Letras Financeiras do Tesouro, issued by the Treasury) and LBCs (Letras do Banco
Central, issued by the Central Bank), which are indexed to the overnight interest rate (SELIC),



122
are very sensitive to changes in interest rates. While high frequency adjustments may have made
sense for investors during periods of high and variable inflation, this is not the economic
environment any longer. By offering fixed rate instruments, the government could share the risk
with market participants who have different risk preferences, thereby benefiting both parties.
Another option for reducing the interest rate risk is to increase the proportion of coupon bonds
and amortization bonds and reduce the number of discounted bullet bonds. This can smooth the
debt-service cash flow and reduce interest rate risk as well as refinancing risk.
24.   The government has, to date, excluded the option to issue inflation-indexed securities,
partly due to low appetite for these securities, and partly for fear of reversing the general success
in deindexing the economy, or signaling to the market that the economy is heading towards
higher inflation in the future. Nevertheless, the Government does not rule out developing this
market in the future. Indeed, many countries with recent inflationary histories, such as Israel and
Chile, as well as countries with very low and stable inflation like the USA, have been using this
instrument to address the longer term markets. Concerns for adverse signaling can be addressed
by establishing explicit limits on the use of this instrument, for example a maximum percentage
of total debt outstanding, or exclusive use for only the longest tenures (more than 5 years).
25.   On the other hand, dollar-indexed securities have been skillfully used to extend the
maturity of the domestic portfolio. However, the overall exposure to foreign exchange risk in
the consolidated federal debt should probably not be increased any further. With devaluation the
share of federal debt exposed to currency movements has already risen to about 50 percent. The
benefits of maintaining current levels (extended maturity and reduced refinancing risk) need to
be weighed against the risk of exposure to foreign exchange volatility. The objective of
extending the maturity of the debt profile through the use of dollar-linked securities should be
maintained and efforts in this direction need be strengthened but without increasing the overall
exposure.
26.   In addition to improvements in the public debt structure, the government can reduce the
cost and risk of the public debt portfolio over the medium run by fuirther developing the domestic
bond market. This is particularly important for Brazil given the importance of the domestic debt
stock both as a share of debt and as a source of vulnerability, and it also follows international
trend towards a greater use of domestic currency debt as a public debt risk management device.
27.   The government can play a crucial role in the development of the domestic debt market
as the largest participant in the market, and as a provider of liquidity and a benchmark yield
curve that will facilitate the pricing of securities in the primary and secondary markets.
Government actions which can improve primary and secondary markets operations are as
follows: pre-announce auctions, standardize and increase the fungibility of instruments, phase
out Central Bank primary issues, promote market making activities, and promote the creation of
centralized electronic trading system. Some of these proposals have already been partially
implemented by the government. Debt managers will need to ensure that their policies and
operations are consistent with the development of an efficient government securities market.



123
28.   Governance and Institutional Framework. The governance framework required for
sound sovereign debt management in Brazil should seek the right mixture of incentives and
accountability for government debt managers. A clear set of objectives for managing the
government's debt, a satisfactory cost and risk framework, specific portfolio and risk
management policies, and further centralization of the government debt management
organization are principles which were the basis for the recent reforms of the debt management
governance and institutional framework in several countries.
29.   An optimal governance framework is grounded in a clear legal framework that clarify
the authority to borrow and to issue new debt, invest, and undertake transactions on the
government's behalf.  The authority to borrow is clearly defined by legislation.  Sound
governance practices are an important component of sovereign debt management, particularly for
countries like Brazil which have large government debt portfolios.
30.   The soundness and credibility of the financial system can be supported by assurances that
the government debt portfolio is being managed prudently and efficiently.  Moreover,
counterparts need assurances that the sovereign debt managers have the legal authority to
represent the government, and that the government stands behind any transactions its sovereign
debt managers enter into. An important feature of the legal framework is the authority to issue
new debt, which is normally stipulated in the form of either borrowing authority legislation with
a preset limit or a debt ceiling.
31.   Centralization of authority to issue new debt complemented by mechanisms which
prevent the potential over-issuance of debt are critical features of the legal framework of debt
management. Brazilian authorities have been moving towards implementing these principles
into their legal framework. For example, the Law of Fiscal Responsibility prevents the Central
Bank from issuing new debt, restricting their activities to repos and the secondary market. This
represents a further move towards centralizing the authority to issue debt in the National
Treasury. In addition, proposals for placing limits on the amount of new debt are currently being
discussed by the government.
32.   For project based loans, Brazilian authorities could assess the need for further
consolidation and centralization because currently the management of these loans is spread
across several agencies outside of the National Treasury. One can argue that while the front
office operations for these loans could be handled by the Ministries under which the projects are
managed given the unique dynamics of project based loans, there seems to be room for further
consolidation in the National Treasury of the back office operations such as budgeting,
accounting, and payment. The advantage of such a consolidation is reduced operational risk and
improved risk management.
33.   The main obstacle to further consolidation is the need for more personnel and
organizational support in the National Treasury necessary to handle the increase in workload.
Possibly an assessment needs to be made of where unnecessary overhead can be simplified and
reduced before centralizing the back office operations of the project based loans. This would
reduce the need for additional manpower and organizational structure that would result from
such a consolidation.



124
34.   Another area which the Brazilian authorities could potentially improve are explicit
regulations concerning trading of options and derivatives in the domestic market. Options and
derivative have become standard tools for risk management for sovereign debt management
authorities in developed countries.  In Brazil, the authority to operate in the options and
derivatives domestic market is currently lacking in the legal framework.
35.   The organizational framework for debt management needs to be well specified, and
ensure that mandates and roles are well articulated. Legal arrangements work best when
supported by delegation of appropriate authority to debt managers. Experience suggests that
there is a range of institutional alternatives for allocating sovereign debt management functions
across one or more agencies, including in one or more of the following: the Ministry of Finance,
Central Bank, autonomous Debt Management Agency, and Central Depository. Regardless of
which approach is chosen, the key requirement is to ensure that the organizational framework
surrounding debt management be clearly specified, that there be coordination and sharing of
information, and that the mandates of the respective players be clear.
36.   In order to further ensure that the debt management organizational framework is clearly
specified in Brazil, a draft of a management and operations guideline which defines functions
and responsibilities within the National Treasury, and particularly for the Debt Office, has been
prepared. The guideline also defines the interrelationship among the various offices within the
Treasury. The Ministry of Planning is currently revising the document. The next step would be
to develop detailed operations manual for individual positions within the Treasury.
37.   Many debt managers file an annual debt management report, which reviews the previous
year's activities, and provides a broad overview of borrowing plans for the current year based on
the annual budget projections. These reports increase the accountability of the government debt
managers. They also assist financial markets by disclosing the criteria used to guide the debt
program, the assumptions and trade-offs underlying the setting of these criteria, and the
managers' performance in meeting them.
38.   As part of the new governance structure, it is also important that there is a clear definition
of responsibilities between the part of the government responsible for approving and supervising
the primary decisions on the public debt management and the other part responsible for
executing that policy in a efficient and transparent way.
39.   Clear debt management objectives are essential in order to reduce uncertainty as to the
government's willingness to trade off cost and risk. Unclear objectives often lead to poor
decisions on how to manage the existing debt and what types of debt to issue, particularly during
times of market instability, resulting in a potentially risky and expensive debt portfolio for the
government and adding to its vulnerability to a crisis. Lack of clarity with respect to objectives
also creates uncertainty within the financial community. This can increase government debt
servicing costs because investors incur costs in attempting to monitor and interpret the
government's objectives and policy framework, and may require a higher risk premium because
of this uncertainty.
40.   Today, governments (treasuries) typically run an integrated operation for the external and
domestic debt. This replaces the earlier arrangement where a Treasury unit, under the Ministry



125
of Finance, was responsible for managing the local currency debt, and the Central Bank was
responsible for managing the external debt.
41.   In some countries, this integration of the external and domestic operations under the
Ministry of Finance has been further modified by strengthening the independence of the resulting
combined operation. This innovation was inspired in most cases by the need to separate the
accountability for the choice of debt policy (expressed in the benchmark) from the accountability
for risk management and operations. It has also been stimulated by the need to attract and retain
highly skilled individuals with an understanding of the financial risk analysis in order to perform
the more sophisticated debt management operations generated by the framework mentioned
above. An additional reason sometimes mentioned is the need to transfer the operational risks of
the more active debt management to an independent vehicle away from government bureaucracy.
Governments which first took the decision to establish an independent debt management office
were Ireland and Sweden, followed by New Zealand and Belgium and more recently Portugal.
42.   The other important organizational need is the establishment of a unified and formal
middle office. A middle office provides the research, analysis, decision support information and
planning activities that are necessary and useful to senior management and the portfolio decision
makers. In the past, the management units in the Treasury or in the Ministry of Finance were
dominated initially by a back office structure that then evolved into a front/back office operation
when the markets became a major source of funding.  With the shift towards a more
sophisticated framework of risk analysis and an integrated portfolio, the need for more formality
in the analysis forced the institutions to incorporate in their organization a middle office
function. This development provided support to policymakers in making decisions based on a
rigorous market risk analysis rather than the traditional heuristic approach.
43.   To proceed with the creation of a competent middle office unit the following issues need
to be considered:
*  A small but fully dedicated analytical team to develop and lead the project should be
organized. The head of this team should be a highly qualified individual with a strong
technical background that will provide intellectual leadership to the exercise and win the
credibility of the technical teams in the Central Bank and Treasury.
* A decision to establish a unified middle office unit in the Treasury (as opposed to the current
arrangement of operations divided between the Treasury and the Central Bank) would be
desirable. Formalizing the existence of the technical group from the beginning will be better
than just having an ad-hoc group but, in either case, having a clear mandate from the top is a
prerequisite.
* Define duties and overall objectives of the middle office. This will help establish
responsibility for centralized risk monitoring and management, as well as the independence
and authority for managing risk, to make sure that longer-term risks and potential costs are
not ignored in pursuit of short-term budgetary savings. (note: does this mean that the middle
office is responsible for managing as well as monitoring risk?)
* Ensure that the middle office has sufficient autonomy to do its job effectively by ensuring
that the debt management office has the information systems, authorities and accountabilities
in place to implement strategies successfully.



126
* The middle office needs to be supported by an integrated information system that would
support the front, middle and back office functions of debt management. Work should begin
by building upon existing systems to facilitate analysis and then to work over the medium
term to modernize the system as a whole.
Box A7.2 provides the major areas of responsibility for a middle office, as well as some of the
critical success factors.
Box A7.2 - Suggested Tasks for a Middle Office
Suggested tasks to be addressed eary on by the new unit might incl    for example:
Revise mulIti-yer budge scenarios

3I  While limited in scope, such analyses can be useful both in tems of their practical relevance to
decision making and for developing real world practical experence in analyzin/ding the debt under
different scenarios.
44.   The core message is that domestic and foreign liabilities should be managed in a
common, integrated framework such that portfolio and balance sheet risk can be assessed as a
whole. This is the underlying reason for establishing a common middle office structure. Such a
middle office structure supports a decision-making process that permits vulnerability, risk and
cost to be more judiciously assessed in sovereign balance sheet management. It allows the
government to develop a structure of asset and liabilities that would protect the public finances
under a range of domestic and international economic scenarios, and to sketch a transition path
toward that structure by designing a medium-term funding strategy.
45.   Irrespective of the institutional setting adapted, the government must be able to enforce
accountability for delivering high quality sovereign debt management and prevent activities
which can add considerable risk to the government's balance sheet. In addition to the general
principles outlined at the beginning of this subsection, specific actions can be taken in order to
strengthen accountability:
* Establish a risk management office within the debt office with the responsibility for
monitoring and reporting on all portfolio and operational risk



127
* Authorize an outside body of advisors to provide oversight and advice across a broad
range of operational and strategic risk management issues.
*  Ensure appropriate auditing of the financial transactions undertaken by the debt office
in order to enforce compliance with the portfolio management policies
*  Establish a code of conduct for the debt managers.
46.   The enforcement of accountability is designed to foster a strong risk management culture.
A code of conduct which provides guidance on matters such as personal portfolios, acceptance of
gifts and representation can similarly encourage behavior standards which can complement the
above activities in ensuring prudent management of the government debt. One of the most
critical responsibilities of the head of the debt office is to enforce proper ethical standards and
foster a strong risk management culture. One possible mechanism for dealing with ethical issues
is to establish an Ethical Committee inside the National Treasury.
47.   Currently in Brazil, a draft of a code of conduct for the Treasury has been prepared which
contain many of the issues mentioned above concerning the conduct of debt management
officials. The draft has been submitted to the legal council within the National Treasury, and
subsequently will be submitted to the Minister of Finance for his approval.
48.   Analytical framework The analytical framework for debt management is based on the
fact that the external and internal debt portfolios are increasingly managed as linked parts of an
overall public debt stock, since they together meet the government's funding needs. The
currency of issue, although an important feature, is no longer considered a sufficient reason for
isolated analysis and management, particularly as foreign investors increasingly hold domestic
debt. An integrated approach to debt management has enabled debt managers to focus on
broader strategic policies to reduce risk over the medium term, including the development of the
domestic debt market. Managing separate parts of the portfolio independently can produce
short-term efficiencies but at the expense of the larger strategic goal of managing risk.
49.   The funding strategy should emphasize risk management and long-term cost reductions,
specifying for instance the issuance plan for the next three to five years -- how much is to be
borrowed, how to borrow, what debt instruments to issue or how to sell them. The strategy
should lay out a specific plan for the transition from floating rate debt to long-term fixed rate
instruments. This plan needs to prioritize the management of different risks and appropriately
deal with the cost-risk trade off. Specifically, in the order of severity, the sovereign debt risks
Brazil faces currently are refinancing risk, interest rate risk, and exchange risk. In terms of cost,
extending the maturity of fixed rate instruments over a short period is costly and should be done
gradually.
50.   A component of the new challenge is the need to develop the analytical tools which
allows for a more active debt management. This implies defining, in a more systematic way, the
desirable debt portfolio structure and then taking concrete actions to achieve the set parameters.
This process includes a more explicit concern for risk, an explicit definition of the risk tolerance
level, and therefore the need to find the appropriate balance in the trade-off between risk and
cost. The ex ante definition of the risk tolerance level in turn allows authorities to make more
precise estimates of the impact of debt service on the budget. Active debt management should
therefore use a framework such as strategic benchmarks that requires the authority to quantify



128
the risks, define limits to those risks, and in many cases, express the desired portfolio in a form
which incorporates the desired risk/cost trade-off.

which focused on the quality of projections and the analytical tools of risk analysis, but the
analysis was done within a static context. The next step would be do the assessment within a
dynamic model which allows scenario analysis based on changes in funding strategy, extem al
conditions, and macroeconomic parameters. Such a model would be critical in improving risk
management through optimal funding strategy.
53.   In the process of incorporating risk management techniques several countries have found
that the level of rigor is enhanced by looking at the sovereign balance sheet as a whole. This
asset-liability management (ALM) approach follows similar applications in corporate finance,
where it is customary to assess and hedge against the impact of fsancial shocks on the net worth
of the firm. Not surprisingly, these techniques have been more popular in countries that were
more exposed to risk, such as Ireland, Sweden, Belgium and New Zealand. These countries
were followed closely bys similuch as Italy, Deons ark, Finlate   and,
Portugal.
54.   The most recent improvements are related to modeling tools.  The most important
development is the use of statistical software packages that allow multiple scenarios to be
explored in a very cost-efficient way (e.g., Monte-Carlo simulations). This has also facilitated



129
in-house analysis of value-at-risk and cash-flow at risk. The stress scenario is a tool that can be
used when the historical data are not representative of the current regime, and where changes in
policy regime are a possibility. By modeling extreme scenarios, these models help raise
awareness of the circumstances under which the debt service could become unmanageable. It
also allows the government to evaluate different funding strategies that senior officials need to
consider in order to achieve the desired portfolio structure.
55.   Capacitv building. For governments in emerging markets such as Brazil, debt
management has usually been a very basic operation until recently. Debt management has been
very back office oriented (debt registration, disbursements, and debt service payments), with
limited strategic and financial analysis carried out by the debt management team. Strategic
thinking and key funding decisions were made much more at the macro level, close to the
minister's office or in the Central Bank, guided by fiscal and balance of payment considerations.
56.   However, recent developments has resulted in a situation where the lack of strategic
thinking is a major constraint on sovereign debt management, and strategic thinking must be
supported by upgraded analytical capacity and market skills. Priority should be given to
improving these capacities when expanding operational capacity in the debt office.
57.   When evaluating the need to build strong operational capacity, there are two areas that
require special attention: human resources and information technology (IT) infrastructure.
58.   The debt management organization will need to be properly staffed. With the new
emphasis on market operation and risk management, debt management will require new skills.
The demand for new skills could be addressed by retraining existing staff, and by bringing
resources from other areas of the government or the market-such as the Central Bank, public
banks, and leading public export companies-which are more routinely exposed to these
disciplines.
59.   The skills required in the middle office to analyze risk and cost/risk tradeoffs will
probably be the most difficult resources to obtain inside the public sector or even in the local
market. In such a situation, the process of building capacity will need to be strongly supported
with significant investment in training and knowledge transfer. At a later stage, if the
government decides to engage in active management of the debt portfolio for purposes of
mitigating risk exposure, the proper skills will also be needed to avoid an increase in operational
risks resulting from activities such as swaps and options.
60.   In most countries, the central government faces serious limitations in properly
compensating specialized human resources. The need to attract and retain personnel with the
proper skills is one of the important reasons why governments establish an independent DMO.
Addressing this issue properly should be an important policy issue when trying to build debt
management capability.
61.   In addition to human resources, a good organization needs an information technology
infrastructure in order to ensure timely supply of accurate and comprehensive information of its
core activities. The debt management operation needs basic information on the portfolio (stocks
and flows), the relevant financial variables, and transaction processing. The basic information



130
needs to be processed in order to conduct analysis of the debt, risk exposure of the portfolio, and
developments in markets where the debt instruments are being traded.
62.   In terms of the information system, the evolution has been similar to the changes in the
organizational structure, in the sense that typically the system was designed mainly for the back
office environment. However, the new needs arising from middle office analysis have been
supported by the development of a parallel system based on PCs and in-house software, at first
without any integration with the existing back office information system. The trend towards
integrated systems has accelerated recently, with commercial banks taking the lead. In the case
of sovereign debt management, derivatives are important tools for the active management of the
debt structure, and an information system that could support these tools must be in place in order
to manage the operational risks of debt management.
63.   In general, efforts are likely to continue to further enhance the operational capacity of the
debt management office in the STN, particularly for the front office which is responsible for
dealing with the market. Strong skills in internal and external market operations need to be
consolidated. Risk management capacity needs to be established in the middle office of the STN
which would include an integrated ALM framework to analyze risk, develop analytical tools to
conduct rigorous analysis, and provide debt reports and information to the public.
