BURUNDI
SECOND HEALTH AND POPULATION PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower         : Republic of Burundi
Beneficiary      : Ministry of Public Health (MOPH)
Amount           : SDR 14.3 million (US$21.3 million equivalent)
Terms            : Standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity
Project Description: The objectives of the proposed project are to improve the health status of
Burundi's population and contribute to sustainable per capita income growth
by slowing population growth, thus reducing population pressures on
resources. It aims to help increase the availability, quality and efficiency of
health services and make them more responsive to the public's expectations.
Together with the contributions of other donors, the proposed project would
constitute a coherent program to support the government in developing
strategies to address the most critical sector issues. Specific objectives are to:
(i) strengthen MOPH's capacity to design and implement key sector reforms;
(ii) improve the efficiency and affordability of health care delivery in rural
areas; (iii) contribute to reducing population growth and maternal and child
mortality rates; and (iv) promote beneficial health and family planning
behaviors. The project would support policies and investments designed to:
(a)    strengthen MOPH capacity to effect reforms in human resource
management (including reducing the shortage of health personnel),
hospital management autonomy, health financing, quality of health
services, and maintenance;
(b)    strengthen service delivery in five out of 15 provinces by supporting
basic health services and rehabilitating nine hospitals;
(c)    implement the maternal and child and family planning (MCH/FP)
policy; and
(d)    improve sectoral information, education and communication (IEC)
activities.
Benefits:           The rehabilitation of health services and the implementation of key sector
reforms would contribute to improving the overall quality of health services,
while making them more accessible to the poor at an affordable cost. The
project is therefore expected to help reduce mortality and morbidity rates in
Burundi. In addition, the successful implementation of the family planning
policy and IEC activities would help Burundi reduce its population growth
rate and promote beneficial health behaviors among the population. The
project would be expected to have the following principal outcomes: (i)
quality of health services in the project area would be judged satisfactory by
60 percent *of the beneficiaries surveyed at the end of the project; (ii)
management autonomy would have been introduced in all public hospitals,



iv                                               Burundi: Second Health and Population Project
with management systems and skills strengthened; (iii) overall sector
financing would increase; (iv) modem contraceptive prevalence would
increase from 1.6% now to 10% by the year 2000; and (v) IEC programs
would contribute to more efficient use of services and greater health
coverage.
Risks:              This is a project with above-average risk. The main risk relates to the
country's unstable political situation; to address this risk, the project has been
designed in a flexible manner, so that some components could be
implemented even during a crisis and the project's intended benefits could be
safeguarded; for example, hospital rehabilitation, implementation of MCH/PF
and IEC activities, and strengthening of hospital management autonomy and
service quality could be implemented first in the safest provinces. However,
implementation of some sector reforms (particularly health financing and
staff redeployment) could be delayed, since they involve political decisions
and actions that may not be feasible in a crisis. In case of a continuous crisis,
the project would be restructured substantially as needed during the mid-term
review. Other risks relate to: (i) the population's response to MOPH's
reforms; to address this risk, a beneficiary assessment has been conducted
and the results used during project preparation; similar assessments and
quality surveys would be carried out throughout project implementation; (ii)
the institutional weaknesses of MOPH, since MOPH's commitment to the
reforms exceeds its current capacity; to address this risk, project support
would include strong capacity-building activities in areas where MOPH lacks
expertise; project implementation would be divided among a number of
different directorates within MOPH, while PCT procurement and financing
functions would be strengthened; and, the project conditions and covenants
would enable close monitoring of project implementation and development
performance; (iii) the weak human resource base, especially the lack of
qualified health personnel; to address this risk, the project would help MOPH
reduce the overall deficiency of personnel, in terms of both quantity and
quality; and (iv) insufficient MOPH funding, which may jeopardize
improvement of health services, especially drug availablity; to address this
risk, Government agreed at negotiations that its proposals for health sector
investments and budgetary allocations would be reviewed by IDA annually,
and that the draft budget would incorporate IDA's comments before its
approval by the Council of Ministers.
Environmental Risks: No environmental risks are foreseen.

I. SECTORAL CONTEXT
A. ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONTEXT
1.1          Economic and political context. With a population of about 5.8 million and an area
of 27,834 km2, Burundi has the second highest population density in Africa after its neighbor
Rwanda. The population comprises two main ethnic groups, the Hutus (85%) and the Tutsis (14%).
Despite demographic pressure (3.1% growth per year) on already constrained land, urbanization is
limited; 94% of the population is still rural. Burundi's GDP per capita is one of the lowest in the
world, at US$180 in 1993.
1.2          Agriculture is Burundi's main economic activity, contributing half of GDP and over
80% of employment and export earnings. Prior to the 1993 political crisis, Burundi was one of the
few African countries self-sufficient in food. Coffee is the most important cash crop, accounting for
70% of merchandise exports. The secondary sector is still small (equivalent to 19% of GDP and
11% of exports) and dominated by the public sector. After 10 years of good performance following
independence (real GDP growth averaged 5.5% a year during 1962-1972), Burundi's economic and
financial situation began to deteriorate from 1972 onwards because of world economic developments
and ethnic violence, and took a further turn for the worse in 1981-1984. The Government launched
an adjustment program in 1986 and began to move towards a more liberal economic and political
regime. Real GDP growth averaged 4.8% during 1987-1989. However, the 1990-1993 period was
marked by backtracking on austerity measures; real GDP growth slowed to an average of 1.4% per
annum, with negative growth in 1993.
1.3          The first free elections held in June 1993 resulted in the election of the first Hutu
president and the acquisition of legislative power by the political party FRODEBU. However, three
months after his inauguration (October 1993), the president and other key FRODEBU leaders were
assassinated in a coup attempt led by a small group within the army. This event gave rise to an
outbreak of violence that left at least 50,000 dead and resulted in the migration of about 800,000
persons to neighboring countries. Many of them returned in the spring of 1994 following the
outbreak of larger-scale violence in neighboring Rwanda, triggered by the airplane crash on April 6,
1994 that killed the presidents of both Rwanda and Burundi. While Burundi succeeded in averting
renewed widespread massacres, these events aggravated long-standing ethnic tensions and made it
difficult for the two ethnic groups to reach a consensus on modalities of power-sharing. Sporadic
violence has continued to occur in parts of the country, perpetuating a sense of insecurity.
1.4         In September 1994, 12 of the country's 13 political parties signed a power-sharing
agreement ("Convention de Gouvernement"), which is to remain in effect for four years, an interim
period during which major constitutional and political reforms are to be discussed and agreed upon.
On October 1, 1994, a new interim president was sworn in and a new Government, headed by the
former prime minister, was formed. In March 1995, there was a further change of Prime Minister
and some Cabinet posts. The political situation remains fragile and needs to be consolidated, in part
through rapid and tangible improvement in the economic and social conditions of the population.
For that purpose, the Government has endorsed an Emergency Recovery Program (ERP), prepared
with IDA assistance in the last semester of 1994, which aims to address Burundi's most pressing
social needs, and set the stage for restoring long-term economic growth potential (para.2. 1).

1.5          Poverty and social conditions. While overall destruction of public infrastructure
was limited to communal buildings and small roads and bridges, the 1993 crisis caused a sharp drop
in both food production and the delivery of social services. In addition, the high number of refugees
and displaced persons exacerbated the human hardship of the crisis, in terms of the breakdown of
social bonds, widespread theft, loss and destruction of property. At present, 200,000 refugees from
Burundi still live in Tanzania and Zaire, while another 600,000 continue to live in displaced-person
camps within Burundi. These factors have together contributed to an increase in poverty, which was
already widespread before the crisis. The latest poverty estimates (June 1994) classify 57% of the
rural population and 59% of the urban population as poor, up from 36% and 42%, respectively, in
1990.
1.6          Burundi's education and health sectors were paralyzed for a year from October 1993
because of the insecurity prevailing throughout the country. Large numbers of personnel fled to
safer zones while others were killed, leaving schools and health facilities inadequately staffed.
Equipment, supplies and vehicles were vandalized or stolen and national distribution channels broke
down. In the education sector, the number of teachers dropped by about 20% in primary schools and
40% in secondary schools. As of September 1994, many primary schools in rural areas had still not
reopened and enrollments had dropped by 25% from the level of September 1993.
1.7          The national health system has relied almost exclusively on international emergency
aid since the crisis began. The substantial flow of humanitarian relief (which amounted to US$85
million in 1994) and the efficiency of aid-coordination mechanisms managed by the MOPH and
donors helped to prevent major epidemics and serious health problems on a national scale.
Nutritional and health care as well as emergency food aid have been provided in the hardest hit areas
and in displaced-person camps by international organizations (UNICEF, International Red Cross,
WHO) and numerous NGOs. With progress in the resolution of the politico-institutional crisis of
October 1993, the national health system has started to operate again. However, it faces serious
operational constraints that will require immediate reforms.
B. HEALTH ST'ATUS AND DELIVERY OF HEALTH SERVICES
1.8          Health Status. Prior to the crisis, Burundi's health status was comparable to the
average for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) despite the country's extremely low GDP per capita. Infant
mortality and under-five mortality rates were estimated at 110 per 1,000 and 173 per 1,000
respectively. Life expectancy (47 years) was slightly below the Sub-Saharan average. Over time,
respiratory diseases, malaria and diarrhea/dysentery have been the main causes of morbidity and
mortality in the general population (Annex 1). The malaria epidemic has been worsening because of
increasing chloroquine resistance and the scarcity of other types of malaria treatment. Women's
health problems and mortality have been especially related to complications during pregnancy and
delivery. The magnitude of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Burundi has become evident only recently.
With urban adult HIV infection rates estimated at 15-20% and rural rates between I and 2%, the
AIDS epidemic is a threat not only to public health but also to the socio-economic development of
the country (para. 1.31). Major disruptions in the delivery of health services and public health
programs during the crisis have had a negative impact on the country's health status, although it is
difficult to assess its scope and magnitude. Chronic malnutrition among children under five has
risen from 26% (1987) to around 40%. Acute malnutrition has increased to 10% among the most
vulnerable groups of the population, particularly among pregnant and breast-feeding women. The
crisis has contributed to an increase of AIDS and sexually-transmitted diseases (STD) in the camps

of displaced persons and refugees in neighboring countries. This foreshadows a further spread of the
AIDS epidemic upon the return of these individuals.
1.9          Health services. The network of health facilities in Burundi is fairly extensive,
providing better health coverage to the population than in most Sub-Saharan countries. 80% of the
population live within five kilometers of a health center, although access is difficult in mountainous
areas. Health services are organized administratively at four levels: central, 15 provinces, 25 health
"secteurs" and 114 communes. Public health services include: one military hospital, one teaching
hospital, one clinic, and two specialized centers (for psychiatry and tuberculosis), all located in the
capital (Bujumbura); 26 hospitals located at the provincial (14) and "secteur" (12) levels; and 270
health centers. Private non-profit religious institutions run a fourth of the country's health services
(10 hospitals and 70 health centers). Religious health facilities are well-managed and adequately
supplied, and provide services of good quality, for which they charge higher user fees than public
facilities. In contrast, the quality of services provided at public health facilities is poor, due to
chronic shortages of essential drugs and supplies, lack of qualified personnel and equipment, and
poor management. Buildings are also in a poor condition. As a consequence, despite their higher
population coverage, Burundi's public health facilities have low utilization rates that are similar to
those of Sub-Saharan Africa; the average bed occupancy rate is only 51% for hospitals, although it
may sometimes reach 85% for the hospitals in the capital.
1.10         MOPH started a few years ago to address the issues of poor quality and management
of public health services. Rehabilitation of most of the country's health centers has been under way
since 1989, with support from donors, including IDA under the ongoing Population and Health
Project (Credit 1862-BI) which has rehabilitated 43 health centers; these efforts began to show some
results prior to the crisis. In comparison, the problems of the rural hospital network, whose role in
primary health care is crucial but often neglected, have yet to be adequately addressed (para. 1.29).
In order to improve management in public hospitals, the Government has introduced management
autonomy in nine facilities, and intends to extend it to all public hospitals by the year 1997.
Autonomous hospitals receive global budgetary allocations from the Government and are allowed to
retain revenues from user fees (in contrast to other hospitals which must forward the proceeds to the
treasury).
1.11         Impact of the crisis on the delivery of health services and programs. Public
health infrastructure did not suffer major physical damage during the crisis: only 45 out of 270
health centers and one hospital need some minor rehabilitation. However, a lot of equipment and
nearly all vehicles have been vandalized or stolen and have to be replaced. During the crisis, the
system suffered from major operational constraints. Most public health facilities were no longer in a
position to offer services because of the breakdown of supply channels and the departure of many
health staff. The national pharmaceutical depot stopped supplying drugs to public health facilities
and budgetary allocations were suspended for several months. Public health programs ceased to
operate as well. Immunization coverage, which had been high by SSA standards (reaching 90% in
some instances), is known to have declined substantially in the hardest hit areas. International relief
aid compensated for the breakdown of the national health system. International NGOs ran public
health services and programs in the provinces and districts worst affected by the crisis. With the
return to greater stability, the national system has again become functional: the drug supply system
has started to operate again and public health facilities have received budgetary allocations.
However, the acute shortage of personnel remains a serious constraint. The MOPH estimates that at
present 24 health centers (9%) are closed, three operate without any qualified personnel and 72
(27%) operate with only one qualified employee; one hospital is closed; five rural hospitals (17%)

operate without any physician, and 14 (48%) operate with one physician who is also the director of
the provincial health administration.
1.12         Health staffing. Even prior to the crisis, Burundi had an overall shortage of health
staff, both clinical and managerial. The total number of physicians was estimated at 337 in 1991, out
of which 110 were expatriates. Although this total represented a significant improvement over the
level in 1987 (206 physicians), the ratio of 17,210 persons per physician was still below WHO
norms. In comparison, the number of paramedical personnel was more adequate, with four
paramedical schools graduating 200 students per year. However, shortages of health personnel were
acute outside the capital because of the uneven distribution of personnel: 60% of all medical staff
and 95% of physician specialists were concentrated in Bujumbura. The crisis affected the physician
situation more adversely than that of paramedical personnel. The shortage of physicians became
heightened with the departure of most of the Rwandese physicians (mainly Tutsi refugees since the
1970s), who returned to Rwanda after fighting ended in mid-1994. Many paramedical personnel in
Burundi's hardest hit areas left for safer places within the country, where they eventually found work
in other public health facilities.
1.13         Health administration. The MOPH is responsible for operating the public health
system.  In 1985, it decentralized certain administrative functions to the provincial level: 15
provincial bureaus (BPS), each headed by a provincial medical director, were to coordinate health
programs (such as immunization and malaria control), IEC activities, as well as drug supply and
staffing, and supervise health facilities. However, provincial bureaus had neither the staff nor the
means to carry out even a minimum level of operations, and sector activity remained overly
centralized. Prior to the crisis, MOPH intended to strengthen the capacity of the provincial bureaus
and provide them with the required resources (through support from the European Union); the impact
of the crisis on the health system has convinced MOPH of the urgent need to implement such
reforms. MOPH has recently taken two important steps in that direction: its organization was
restructured to reflect the new authority given to the 15 BPS as well as the autonomous hospitals
(Annex 2); and budgetary allocations for the BPS were specifically identified in the 1995 health
budget. Much has yet to be done to assess the full implications of the decentralization in terms of
staffing and financial needs, and to define the new roles of the administration and autonomous health
facilities (para. 1.27). Beginning in 1991, the health information system was strengthened with the
assistance of UNICEF, USAID and the ongoing IDA-supported Population and Health Project. This
system, managed by the Bureau of Epidemiological Statistics (EPISTAT), is now fairly well
organized and provides good health data. Feedback is provided through a monthly bulletin which is
sent to provinces and "secteurs".
1.14         Health Financing. Although available data on health expenditures are neither
complete nor fully reliable, total health expenditure in Burundi could be roughly estimated at US$7
to 8 per capita in 1991 (latest data available), which was equivalent to 3 to 4% of GDP. Main
sources of financing include: (i) public expenditures (around 70% of total health expenditure), with
central Government expenditures accounting for only 25% of total expenditure and external aid for
about 45%; (ii) a health insurance scheme for the civil service (around 16% of the total); (iii) private
pharmaceutical expenditures, excluding those reimbursed by civil service health insurance (7%); (iv)
total health expenditures of the religious network of health facilities (5%); and (v) cost recovery at
public health facilities (2%).

1.15          Public health expenditure. Compared to other SSA countries, Burundi ranks among
those with a medium level of Government health expenditure, as a percentage of both GDP and total
Government expenditure. However, in terms of Government health expenditure per capita (both
recurrent and capital), which amounted to US$2.13/capita in 1993, Burundi ranks in the lowest group
of countries, reflecting its poverty. MOPH recurrent expenditures accounted for 5 to 6% of the
Government's recurrent expenditures during 1984-1994 (Annex 3, Table 1); their share of GDP at
constant prices gradually increased to nearly 1% in 1993. There are no major imbalances in the
distribution of MOPH recurrent expenditures (Annex 3, Table 2): personnel expenditure accounted
for 59%  of MOPH's recurrent budget in 1991 and declined to 47%  in 1993 (reflecting the
elimination of salaries for the autonomous hospitals which are included in their global budget).
Drugs and laboratory and surgical supplies are the second largest source of expenditure, accounting
for 21% of MOPH's recurrent budget in 1993. Other expenditures, including those for equipment
and vehicle maintenance, are inadequate and have increased at a slower rate than the overall budget;
they are mainly made by hospitals.
1.16           External aid financed 86% of capital expenditures for the health sector in the fifth
Five-Year Plan (1988-1992). A 1993-1995 Public Expenditure Program (PEP) was prepared by
MOPH prior to the crisis. Total public expenditures planned for the health sector in 1993 were
significant, equivalent to US$6.4/capita or 3.4% of GDP. However, major programs were delayed
and could not be implemented due to the crisis. The Government has prepared a draft Public
Investment Program (PIP) for 1995-1997, which still needs to be refined to take into account all
donors' interventions and is currently being reassessed. It was agreed during negotiations that the
1996 recurrent budget and 1996-1998 PIP for the health sector will be submitted to IDA by October
30, 1995 (para. 3.15).
1.17          Insurance and user fees. The total expenditures of the health insurance scheme for
the civil service, managed by the "Mutuelle de la Fonction Publique" (MFP), were equivalent to 75%
of MOPH recurrent expenditures in 1991 (latest data available). This contributory scheme, which
started in 1980, provides good health coverage for around 400,000 civil servants and their direct
dependents (7% of the total population). Benefits cover the costs of ambulatory and in-patient care
in public and private non profit health facilities as well as prescribed drugs. For the first time in
1991, MFP did not realize a profit. The major cause of MFP's deteriorating performance has been
the growing amount of reimbursements for prescribed drugs, due to the increased frequency of fraud
(use of benefits for uninsured individuals), high prices of pharmaceuticals sold in private pharmacies,
and poor prescription practices.  MFP's expenditures are likely to rise significantly with the
introduction of management autonomy in all public hospitals, which will then have a strong
incentive to bill it for services provided to its beneficiaries. In September 1993 (just before the
October events), MFP contracted consultant services to help design strategies to address the main
causes of its financial difficulties. With the return to greater stability in 1995, MFP will be in a
position to further elaborate on these strategies. Since 1983, private employers in the formal sector
have been responsible for 100% of the medical expenses incurred by their employees (around 20,000
salaried workers) and their families. Due to the increasing cost of health care, employers are willing
to continue contributing to employees' health care expenditures only through a health insurance
scheme, whose establishment was being considered by the Labor Ministry and the National Social

Security Institute (INSS) just prior to the crisis (the work stopped thereafter and has not yet
resumed).
1.18          The existing pre-payment scheme for the public sector ("Carte d'Assistance
M6dicale" or CAM) has yielded only marginal revenues, equivalent to 3% of MOPH's recurrent
expenditures in 1990. The CAM was introduced in 1984 as an annual pre-payment scheme for
health care, entitling the card holder and direct dependents to free medical care and drugs in public
health centers and hospitals. Despite its low price of FBu 500 (US$2 equivalent), unchanged since
1984, only 20 to 25% of the population is estimated to have bought the card in any given year.
Several reasons explain this low rate of utilization. First, the purchase of the CAM does not
guarantee access to services in practice, since drugs are often lacking at public health facilities. As
revenues from CAM sales and user fees are not retained at health centers but returned to communes,
cost recovery has not contributed to improving the quality of services. According to 1991 data, only
14% of CAM proceeds was, on average, used by communes to finance recurrent costs of health
centers (Annex 3, Table 3). Second, given the low level of user fees for ambulatory care, the card
does not offer any significant advantage, except for expensive hospital care. Indeed, as the CAM
system has no qualifying period, the card tends to be purchased just prior to hospitalization, resulting
in considerable savings in certain cases. Third, non-profit health facilities do not accept the CAM
since they are not reimbursed for the services provided. For this reason, families who use private
services (around 30% of the population) may never purchase the card.
1.19          User fees have existed in the public health sector since 1983, for patients not holding
a CAM card and for MFP-insured patients who have to pay 20% of total fees ("ticket moderateur").
Proceeds from user fees at public health centers and hospitals are very low, equivalent to I and 4%
of MOPH's recurrent expenditures, respectively. The reasons are both the low fees themselves and
the lack of incentives for public health facilities to seek payment of charges, since proceeds are
returned either to communes or to the treasury (in the case of non-autonomous hospitals). Higher
user fees are charged by the non-profit sector, on a fee schedule agreed with MOPH. Health
facilities managed by the Catholic organization CARITAS had an average cost recovery ratio of 77%
in 1991, with health and maternity centers having a much higher ratio (94%) than hospitals (49%).
However, grants received from foreign missions and salaries of foreign nurses often are not included
in the numbers.
1.20          Drug Supply. Drugs are supplied by both the public sector and the private sector as
well as religious organizations. The Government-run national office of pharmacy (ONAPHA)
represents the country's only local pharmaceutical production operation and supplies 48
pharmaceutical products (mostly essential drugs). ONAPHA is currently attached to the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry, with MOPH as its main client. Due to its poor efficiency, ONAPHA was
on the list of public enterprises to be privatized under the Bank's (Third) Structural Adjustment
Credit for Burundi (June 1992). Although such an action did not take place prior to the crisis, it will
be reconsidered when the privatization program is reestablished on the Government's agenda. Drugs
in the public sector are procured by the national pharmaceutical depot and distributed to the 15 BPS,
which are responsible for allocating them to health facilities. In an attempt to rationalize drug
distribution and reduce drug shortages, MOPH started in 1991 to allocate drugs to each health

facility on the basis of a standardized list of essential drugs and rational criteria. Despite this
improvement, health facilities still face frequent shortages of drugs, estimated at three months of
consumption per year according to field observations and studies.  This is primarily due to
insufficient drug allocations (MOPH's drug budget was a low US$0.38/capita in 1993) and to poor
management and procurement practices at the central depot.  During project preparation, MOPH
designed measures to improve drug availability and management, for implementation under the
proposed project. However, the European Union has since committed to financing such measures,
beginning in 1995 (Annex 4). It will assist MOPH in: (i) developing an essential drug policy; (ii)
strengthening management and procurement at the pharmaceutical depot; (iii) improving drug
management and use in public health facilities, by setting up drug management tools and training
health staff in proper prescription practices; and (iv) later (mid- 1996), transforming the depot into an
autonomous unit charged with the procurement of essential drugs that are competitively priced, for
subsequent sale to health facilities in the public and non profit private sectors, and decentralizing
drug distribution.
1.21         Information, Education and Communication (IEC). The ongoing IDA-financed
Population and Health Project (Cr. 1862-BI) has helped introduce IEC activities within MOPH, by
providing support to the then existing Health Education Bureau that had undertaken some activities
in traditional health education. IEC activities are presently carried out by the Health Education Unit
(HEU) located in the Hygiene and Prevention Directorate of the MOPH; its mandate is to plan,
coordinate and control the quality of IEC activities. In the past, HEU has been successful in
informing and educating the population about public health problems and motivating them to change
their behavior: (i) it contributed to the increase in vaccination coverage in the late 1980's and to the
control of the 1992 meningitis epidemic; (ii) it has assisted the National AIDS Control Program in
increasing AIDS awareness among the Burundian population; and (iii) it has produced high quality
(even award winning) informational materials. However, increased demands from the various
programs have greatly diminished HEU's efficiency during the last three years (para. 1.32). The
need for additional staff proved a particular bottleneck, given Burundi's weak IEC capacity and
HEU's limited pool of adequately trained and qualified management staff.
C. KEY SECTOR ISSUES
1.22         Main sector issues are the following: (i) shortage of health personnel; (ii) lack of
performance and equity of existing financing mechanisms; (iii) poor management and institutional
capacity; (iv) inadequacy of the rural hospital network; (v) rapid population growth; (vi) a major
AIDS epidemic; and (vii) limited IEC capacities.
1.23         Shortage of health personnel. The reasons for the current deficit of physicians and
paramedicals are divergent and call for tailored strategies, which will be developed, starting in 1995,
by MOPH with donor support, including IDA (Annex 4). Even prior to the crisis, Burundi was short
of physicians and quite dependent upon expatriates (especially Rwandese), who accounted for a third
of all physicians in the public sector. Given the current shortage of physicians at public hospitals
(para. 1.11) and the low output of graduates from the medical school (20 per year), it will take years
before Burundi can meet the minimum norms required to make the system work adequately. MOPH
will have to design, along with the Ministry of Higher Education, strategies to increase both the
output of physicians and the relevance of their training, in order to meet sector needs more quickly
and adequately. The main strategy will be to reduce the high dropout rate at the medical school: out
of 70 students accepted each year, only 20 graduate. A study done in 1993 with the support of the



8                                               Burundi. Second Health and Population Project
ongoing IDA project showed that the dropout rate between the first and third years of the medical
curriculum was more than 60%. In the short term, however, MOPH will have to recruit expatriate
physicians to meet the most urgent needs for clinical physicians, especially in provincial and
"secteur" hospitals. Most donors have agreed to finance short-term expatriate technical assistance
until the number of national physicians available on the market is sufficient.
1.24         Compared to the scarcity of physicians, the current shortage of paramedicals is more
directly related to Burundi's crisis. The extent of the current deficit in many health facilities (para.
1.1 1) calls for the urgent development and implementation of strategies aimed at providing minimum
services and restoring the confidence of the population. MOPH intends to develop various short term
strategies, including redeploying existing health personnel on the basis of their individual
preferences and health personnel needs. MOPH has also decided, with the agreement of the Ministry
of Finance, to grant travel-related allowances to around 300 staff who would accept temporary
assignments (up to five days a week) in insecure areas experiencing high deficits. With support from
UNDP, the Government started in 1992 to design civil service reform, but efforts were stopped due
to the crisis; given the current political situation in Burundi, implementation of such reform within
the next few years is unlikely. However, the introduction of management autonomy in all public
hospitals will provide financial incentives for health personnel, since such hospitals could recruit
contractual staff under their own salary scales and provide financial incentives to civil servant staff.
These developments would, in turn, pose new challenges for MOPH, to be addressed in its policy
framework for hospital management autonomy (Annex 5); for example, MOPH will have to define
the extent of power that the board of directors of an autonomous hospital will enjoy in defining
personnel policies (including salaries, hiring, laying off, promotion, training, etc.).
1.25         Lack of performance and equity of existing financing mechanisms. Existing
financing mechanisms for public health services have failed to improve service quality and ensure
equitable access. The vast majority of the population lives in rural areas and has access to public
health services that are inexpensive but of poor quality. As a result, rural patients have invariably to
buy expensive drugs and medical supplies from private suppliers, or pay relatively high fees for
drugs and medical services at private religious health facilities, if able to access and afford them. In
comparison, salaried workers from the public and private sectors, who are largely urban dwellers,
benefit from good health insurance coverage financed (at high cost) by their employers. Urban
dwellers also have access to better quality services, especially at those hospitals the quality of which
improved significantly when they became autonomous (because of their capability to retain revenues
and the solvency of their insured patients). Urgent reforms are needed to: (i) increase the sector's
overall level of resources and ensure adequate financing for health facilities, especially in rural areas;
(ii) improve access to affordable, quality health services for the vast majority of the population; and
(iii) strengthen existing planning tools, such as PEPs and PIPs.
1.26         Increased resources will be generated by enabling the health sector to retain and
manage proceeds from the CAM and user fees, and raising the sector's overall performance in terms
of revenue mobilization. Improved equity will be ensured by increasing the quality of public
services in rural areas, maintaining the affordability of the CAM, and establishing adequate
mechanisms to subsidize the CAM for the poor. Since 1992, both the majority and opposition parties
in Burundi have been strongly committed to introducing such reforms, including the eventual
establishment of nationwide health insurance for the rural population. Government commitment
remains strong today, as these reforms are essential to building national reconciliation (by improving
equity and transparency in resource allocation). To quickly ensure access to health services for the
poor and needy, the Government has included in the 1995 Emergency Recovery Program (ERP) the



Burundi: Second Health and Population Project                                        9
financing of two social funds: one of FBu 215 million (US$0.9 million) to subsidize the CAM for the
displaced persons and refugees (through a temporary mechanism to be designed and managed by the
ministry in charge of them); and one of FBu 80 million (US$0.3 million) to subsidize the CAM for
indigents (through a mechanism to be designed by MOPH).
1.27         Poor management and institutional capacity. MOPH is strongly committed to
restoring public health services and ensuring their adequate functioning.   However, the
overcentralization of the health system, weak institutional capacity at the rural levels, and overall
lack of qualified personnel pose obstacles to the success of needed reforms. Aware of these issues,
MOPH has already taken some important steps towards decentralizing key management functions,
by deciding to grant managerial autonomy to both the central pharmaceutical depot and the public
hospitals, decentralize drug distribution, and strengthen administration at peripheral levels (by giving
them  more responsibilities and resources).  However, MOPH has not yet fully assessed the
implications of these policy decisions. The roles and functions of MOPH (at the central, provincial
and district levels) and of the autonomous health facilities and their interrelationships have yet to be
adapted to these new strategies. MOPH also needs to define the extent and scope of hospital
management autonomy, and the type of regulatory and control mechanisms required to ensure the
provision of quality hospital services. Another major impediment is the overall shortage of qualified
personnel within MOPH: the central level enjoys a significant number of qualified key staff but has a
shortage of qualified medium-level staff, the provincial levels have an overall deficiency in
personnel, in terms of both quantity and quality, and the entities soon to become autonomous lack the
managerial capacity to assume their new functions. MOPH will strengthen, with donor support
(Annex 4) its managerial and technical capacity required to: (i) design and implement its sector
reforms; and (ii) empower the various stakeholders of the reforms to assume their new roles and
responsibilities.
1.28         At the central level, capacity building will be provided through the recruitment of
long term local consultants to assist MOPH in designing and implementing some of the reforms that
the project will support (human resource management, health financing, and hospital managerial
autonomy). These consultants would not only provide crucial input in designing and implementing
reforms, but also train MOPH staff (especially medium-level staff), and strengthen existing
capacities in policy analysis, planning and programming, as well as in specific technical areas (e.g.,
cost studies, public expenditure programming). MOPH staff will also receive the support of short
and long term technical assistance and benefit from comprehensive training programs (including
study tours abroad).  At the provincial level, MOPH will first ensure that the 15 directors of the
provincial bureaus assume their functions as provincial directors and relinquish clinical work at
provincial hospitals. They will concentrate primarily on supervising their respective health facilities,
especially those with few or no qualified personnel, and ensuring that health facilities have access to
adequate human and financial resources through appropriate redistribution of such resources within
the province. The staffing of the provincial health bureaus (BPS) will increase only gradually, as
resources permit. Donors will strengthen capacities of health staff at the provincial and district
levels and in the new autonomous entities through extensive training programs and provision of
external technical assistance (Annex 4).
1.29         Inadequacy of the rural hospital network. The conditions of health facilities have
been summarized in paras. 1.10 and 1.11. Most provincial and "secteur" hospitals are unable to
deliver adequate curative services and backstop health centers in the provision of primary health
care. Buildings are in poor condition and most equipment needs to be replaced. Although more
Government resources are allocated to hospitals than to health centers, provincial and "secteur"



10                                              Burundi: Second Health and Population Project
hospitals have never received a fair share of resources when compared with hospitals in Bujumbura.
Shortages of physicians (particularly specialists) and a lack of consumable supplies have always
been a critical issue (patients are sometimes referred to Bujumbura even for X-rays). These hospitals
have also been poorly managed, with no incentives to become efficient. MOPH has elaborated a
rehabilitation plan covering all 26 public provincial and "secteur" hospitals (Annex 6).
Rehabilitation works were initiated a few years ago and will continue with the support of several
donors, including IDA through the proposed project. MOPH also intends to extend management
autonomy to all public hospitals by the year 1997.
1.30         Rapid population growth. The growth of the population of Burundi is one of its
most important constraints to development. With a current growth rate of 3.1% per year (up from
2% during 1975-80), the population will double in 25 years. The total fertility rate is estimated at 6.8
children per woman, which is above the SSA average of 6.4. Nearly half the population (47%) is
under 15. Burundi will continue to face a high dependency ratio (close to 1) over the next few
decades if this trend remains constant. Despite political leaders' awareness, a major gap has existed
between official declarations and actions taken: the current family planning program has lacked
Government support and the modem contraceptive prevalence rate (MCPR) is still only 1.6%. The
recent crisis has resulted in delaying the implementation of important efforts toward reform: (i) the
population policy statement, drafted in October 1992, has still not been ratified; and (ii) the national
population council (CONAPO), which was to oversee the implementation of this policy, has not yet
been established. Long a high priority, population control has become a particularly sensitive issue
since the crisis; it is therefore difficult to anticipate the timing of these reforms. However, continued
potential exists to expand family planning services, as shown in the 1987 Demographic and Health
Survey. Donors, including IDA (Annex 4), will help MOPH implement its Medium-Term Family
Planning Program; this program, prepared in 1993, has targeted an MCPR of 10% by 1997; however,
this goal is over-optimistic in light of subsequent political events.
1.31         The Impact of the AIDS Epidemic. The Government was slow in responding to
the AiDS challenge; the National AIDS Control Program (PNLS) was set up as late as 1988.
However, as mortality from present infections rises, policy makers in many sectors will be forced to
confront the specter of AIDS. The estimated 100,000 AIDS deaths that could occur between now
and the year 2005 will be concentrated among Burundians who are urban dwellers (although
eventually rural mortality will predominate), more educated, and female (urban women are infected
at twice the rate of men). Past gains in child survival will decreased and the number of orphans is
projected to increase from 18,000 to 90,000 by the year 2005. Under the PNLS, a medium-term plan
and multisectoral strategy to address AIDS issues have been developed, supported by a multi-donor
effort. However, the scope of the disease will require greater investment in coming years to educate
the population, distribute condoms and control STD. Given the availability of grant funds, the
Government has not requested financing from IDA to help implement the plan and strategy.
However, the proposed project could provide indirect support to this effort by strengthening related
IEC activities. In addition, as a part of its sector work, the Bank has started working with the
Government in conducting an assessment of the socioeconomic impact of AIDS; this exercise may
influence the Government's assessment of the adequacy of the current level of effort. Reallocation of
project financing for AIDS-related activities could be considered at the mid-term review if needed.
1.32         Limited IEC Capacities. Successful in 1989-1991, IEC activities have since been
hampered by serious problems. At the central level, the planning and coordination unit is now very
weak and unable to efficiently plan and coordinate the IEC activities of many vertical or semi-
vertical programs; this problem is further compounded by the absence of personnel trained in IEC at



Burundi: Second Health and Population Project                                        11
the provincial and community levels. The lack of IEC capacity prevents delegation by the central
office, which has instead to carry out all the activities itself in lieu of planning, coordinating and
supervising them. As a result, the central office staff is overburdened and unable to respond to the
demands of all programs. Programs which used to work with HEU until recently thus have a
tendency to carry out their own activities independently, which creates severe coordinating problems.
This situation has tended to erode the progress made over the last few years. An analysis of the
country's IEC situation carried out during project preparation shows HEU to be in a critical state.
The main problems are:  (a) at the central level: a lack of specialized skills, especially in
management and planning, but also in research and evaluation; and too much emphasis on material
production, rather than on planning, coordination, technical assistance, supervision and quality
control; (b) at the provincial level, a lack of trained personnel to supervise IEC field activities, and to
train IEC personnel; and (c) at the community level, a lack of capacities to carry out IEC activities,
either in the community or in the health centers. Inability to carry out good communications
campaigns hampers the efforts of MOPH to improve public knowledge about individual self-care
and beneficial health behaviors, including contraceptive behaviors. Lack of research capacity results
in a poor understanding of health problems by the public, and policy makers' inability to take
account of the target audiences' points of view. Without this capacity, the family planning program
would be unable to reach its objective.

II. SECTOR STRATEGIES AND THE BANK'S ROLE
A. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY AND EXTERNAL AID
2.1          Rehabilitation of the health system. Starting in September 1994, the Government
of Burundi with IDA support prepared an Emergency Recovery Program (ERP) for 1995 to finance
the immediate needs of priority sectors, including health. Its total cost is US$53 million, of which
US$15.5 million is for health (the outline of the program for the health sector is given in Annex 4).
The Government of Burundi has submitted the ERP to various donors, including IDA, which
approved in December 1994 a US$14.6 million Emergency Assistance Credit (Cr. 2668-BI). Of this
amount, US$6 million should be spent for the health sector. The Emergency Assistance Credit
became effective in April 1995. This aid, together with that to be provided by other donors, should
cover the financing needed for the sector's rehabilitation program in 1995; the European Union has
committed to contribute US$5.3 million in 1995, and other donors are also providing significant
support to help rebuild Burundi's health system (Annex 4).
2.2          The Government's sector strategies. Beyond the transition phase of restoring
health services, the Government wants to introduce the structural reforms which are urgently
required to make the system operate more effectively and equitably and respond better to the needs of
the population. Most of these reforms had been defined prior to the crisis but need to be refined in
line with the new country situation. The Government intends to develop the following strategies: (i)
decentralize the health system, by giving management autonomy to public hospitals and provincial
health bureaus (BPS), and later to health centers, and by strengthening their capabilities; (ii) develop
a human resource policy to reduce the acute shortage of medical personnel; (iii) improve the
performance and equity of existing health care financing mechanisms; (iv) improve drug availability
and affordability, by developing an essential drug policy and establishing an autonomous essential
drug procurement unit; (v) strengthen basic health services and hospitals in peripheral areas; (vi)
control public health problems, such as AIDS; and (vii) implement innovative family planning
strategies, as a way to control population growth. The Government has, as a condition of Board
presentation, submitted a signed sector policy letter, including an action plan and timetable,
acceptable to IDA, which is presented at Annex 7 (para. 7.3 (a)).
2.3          Other donors' activities. The country's main donors have made a commitment to
assist MOPH in implementing its key strategies over the next few years (Annex 4). The European
Union will support the strengthening of the BPS; initial and in-service training for paramedical
personnel; and pharmaceutical sector reform, including the establishment of an autonomous drug
procurement unit.  The European Union, Belgium, France and Germany will finance the
rehabilitation of provincial and "secteur" hospitals. In addition, WHO, UNICEF, UNDP and
Belgium will support the strengthening of basic health services and public health programs, while
UNFPA and Germany will continue to support the implementation of the population policy. Finally,
a multi-donor effort is supporting Burundi's national AIDS program. The high quality of current
donor coordination is a result of the commendable efforts made by MOPH throughout 1993 and
1994. The Government has committed itself, in its sector policy letter, to maintain the existing aid
coordination mechanisms, including regular quarterly meetings with donors to review the
implementation of sector reforms.

B. THE BANK'S ROLE
2.4          The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Burundi. The CAS is being
presented to the Executive Directors on May 25, 1995 with the proposed project. The proposed CAS
aims to help Burundi avert a socio-political breakdown and lay the foundations for economic
recovery and diversified growth, with a view to increasing employment opportunities and improving
equity, mainly through productivity gains in agriculture and increased access to social services. The
broad reform agenda focuses on the following: (i) increased equity and better governance; (ii)
environmentally sustainable, accelerated growth based on private sector development; and (iii)
human resource development through better quality of, and increased access to, education and health
services, and reduced demographic growth. The proposed project is a central part of the CAS and is
included in all three alternative lending scenarios which are proposed in the CAS (Best-effort,
Social-core and Disengagement). The Bank's assistance to the social sectors in Burundi started in
1977. There are two ongoing projects: the Population and Health Project and the Education Sector
Development Project, which have sought to improve basic health and education services. They both
started in 1988 and will both be completed by the end of 1995. A Social Action Project (FY93) was
further initiated to improve living conditions among the poor and vulnerable groups through
subprojects of a social fund aimed at improved productivity, enhanced access to social services, and
increased employment opportunities. A new education project is being prepared. In addition, sector
work (FY95-96) is being conducted with the Government on the socio-economic impact of AIDS.
2.5          The proposed project would form an integral part of the Government's and the
Bank's strategies, helping the Government to: (i) strengthen MOPH capacity to effect sector
reforms, including the system's ability to provide quality services affordable to the poor and respond
adequately to the public's expectations; and (ii) improve the quality and efficiency of health care
delivery in rural areas. It will also assist the Government in implementing its maternal and child
health, family planning and IEC policies, targeting reduced population growth and improved health
and family planning behaviors. Along with other donor interventions, the proposed project would
constitute a coordinated and joint effort to support the Government's health sector strategies It
would complement the efforts of the ongoing health project to strengthen health centers, which
represent the primary level of health care delivery.
C. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PAST PROJECTS
2.6          IDA's ongoing Population and Health Project (Cr. 1862-BI, US$14 million,
approved in FY 1988) will be completed by June 30, 1995. Project objectives were to improve
maternal and child health by strengthening such services and nutrition activities, on a nationwide
basis. The project is progressing well towards its overall stated objectives. However, efforts to
strengthen family planning services and design health financing strategies suffered from a lack of
Government commitment and weak institutional capacity; these two areas will be addressed under
the proposed project. Project implementation in Burundi has been generally satisfactory in terms of
procurement and disbursement rates. The main lessons learned from the first project are the
following: (a) a project is better implemented when the Government is committed, when key MOPH
staff are involved in project design and preparation, and when beneficiary opinions are taken into
account during project preparation; (b) managerial and institutional capacities to develop project
activities need to be carefully assessed during project preparation and adequate strengthening must
be provided throughout project implementation; (c) strengthening health centers is not enough to
ensure an improvement in overall health service delivery; (d) rehabilitation activities should



14                                               Burundi: Second Health and Population Project
emphasize equally physical and qualitative inputs and outputs (increased service capacity and
quality); and (e) key functions, such as project coordination, procurement and accounting need to be
strengthened. Another major lesson learned from the implementation of such projects in other
countries is that the transfer of health policy and management responsibility to decentralized levels
and autonomous entities needs to be gradual and accompanied by adequate transfers of authority and
financial, physical and human resources.
2.7           The design of the proposed project has incorporated all these lessons by: (a)
involving MOPH officials and high-level staff in project design and preparation, and carrying out
beneficiary assessment during project preparation (other assessments will be conducted throughout
project implementation); (b) requesting a draft letter of sector policy that could serve as a monitoring
tool during annual and mid-term reviews; (c) recruiting high-level local consultants qualified in areas
of MOPH deficiency; (d) rehabilitating hospitals to improve their capacity to backstop the first level
of care; (e) ensuring that, within three months of being granted autonomy, public hospitals have
adopted the related regulations and by-laws and that, within six months after their rehabilitation,
project hospitals have introduced management accounting systems and training programs in hospital
management, and have sufficient staffing; (f) strengthening coordination, procurement and
accounting functions within the PCT; and (g) ensuring progressive management autonomy for
hospitals and BPS, with transfer of adequate material and financial resources and strengthening of
their management capacities.

III. THE PROJECT
A.    OBJECTIVES AND CONTENT OF THE PROJECT
3.1.          The project was appraised in May 1993 but negotiations could not take place
because of the October 1993 events. The installation of a new Government in September 1994
enabled various donors, including IDA, to redefine and coordinate their activities in the sector. The
project was re-appraised in December 1994. Its content has been redefined on the basis of the new
priorities of MOPH and other donors' interventions. The project and the contributions of other
donors (Annex 4) together constitute a coherent program to support the Government in its efforts to
develop and implement all the sector strategies defined in its sector policy letter.
3.2           The objectives of the proposed Second Health and Population Project are to improve
the health status of Burundi's population and contribute to sustainable per capita growth by slowing
population growth, thus reducing population pressures on resources. The project aims to do this by
increasing the availability, quality and efficiency of health services and making them more
responsive to the public's expectations. Specific objectives are to: (i) strengthen MOPH's capacity to
design and implement key sector reforms; (ii) improve the availability and quality of health care
delivery in rural areas; (iii) contribute to reducing population growth and maternal and child
mortality rates; and (iv) promote beneficial health and family planning behaviors.  Project
components consist of: (i) strengthening MOPH's capacity to effect key sector reforms in human
resource management, hospital management autonomy, health financing, quality of health services,
and maintenance; (ii) strengthening service delivery in five out of 15 provinces, by supporting basic
health services and rehabilitating nine hospitals; (iii) implementing the maternal and child and family
planning (MCH/FP) policy; and (iv) improving IEC activities.
3.3.          Given the country's current political situation, the project has been designed in a
flexible manner to permit the implementation of certain activities even in a context of a renewed
political crisis and insecurity in certain parts of the country. Rehabilitation of project hospitals
would be done in three phases that would be modified according to the prevailing state of security,
starting with hospitals located in the safest provinces. Likewise, management autonomy and health
service quality would first be strengthened in these hospitals. Implementation of MCH/FP policy and
IEC activities at the provincial and community levels also would first be carried out in the safest
areas of the country. Activities to support design and implementation of sector reforms would be the
most affected by a renewed crisis, although some reforms (such as implementing strategies to reduce
shortage of health personnel and strengthening hospital management autonomy) could be tailored and
implemented more quickly to address a new crisis. However, reforms aimed at improving existing
financing mechanisms and redeploying health personnel could be delayed, since they involve
political decisions or actions that may not be feasible in an aggravated crisis. In case of a continuous
crisis, the project would be restructured substantially as needed during the mid-term review. Finally,
it was agreed with MOPH and other donors that flexibility would be introduced in the project's
financing to address emerging new sector priorities, as well as permit eventual co-financing from
other donors during implementation. Existing aid coordination mechanisms, including quarterly
meetings with donors, will permit regular updating of sector priorities and reallocation of donor
support if necessary.

B.    DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
Component 1: Institutional Strengthening
Total Cost: US$7.7 million
IDA Contribution: US$5.3 million
3.4          Human resource development and management. The main objective is to assist
MOPH in designing and implementing strategies to reduce the current shortage of medical personnel
and correct the geographical imbalance in the distribution of such personnel. These strategies would
include: (i) annual recruitment of new graduates; (ii) redeployment of personnel, based on the
demand for, as well as individual preferences of, health personnel; (iii) payment of travel-related
allowances to paramedical personnel willing to work on temporary assignments in the most insecure
areas of the country; (iv) short-term recruitment of expatriate physicians, if possible from within the
region, to provide emergency replacement technical assistance; (v) negotiation of contracts with
private religious health facilities for the management of health centers in hardship areas; and (vi)
support for initial and in-service training of medical personnel. Given the crucial importance of the
issue, the MOPH intends to start designing some of the strategies in 1995, with PPF financing. The
proposed project would result in the following outcomes: (i) a redeployment plan would be designed
by mid-1996; (ii) existing health staff would be redeployed by the end of 1997; and (iii) personnel
needs, as defined by MOPH, would be fulfilled by the year 2000 (Annex 8).
3.5          As preliminary tasks, the MOPH will carry out with PPF support a thorough
inventory of active personnel, by health facility and province, and a survey of the medical personnel
who are currently not at their posts. It will then assess priority staffing needs over the next five
years. A human resource committee composed of key MOPH officials in charge of directorates and
programs has been set up to lead these activities. The Government would submit to IDA for its
review a detailed assessment of total personnel needs within the public health sector as a condition
of credit effectiveness (para. 7.4(a)). Staffing needs for physicians in the nine project hospitals have
been estimated on the basis of their current staffing (both national and expatriate). It was assumed
that half the number of additional physicians needed would be Burundi nationals recruited by MOPH
and the other half would be expatriate physicians, financed under the proposed project. These needs
will be reassessed shortly in the context of a detailed study on the current situation of the nine
hospitals, to be carried out under PPF financing (para. 3.22). The project would ensure that the
adequate number of health personnel would be assigned by MOPH to the nine project hospitals (para
3.23). Paramedicals who would be willing to work in insecure areas would be given a per diem (as a
travel-related allowance) per day spent away from their current place of residence. The staff would
be asked to work four-five days in these areas and would return either each night or each weekend to
their current place of residence. These allowances would be time-bound and would be eliminated as
these areas return to more stability. These allowances have been calculated at one-third of MOPH
approved per diem rates for civil servants (i.e. 500 FBu, or US$2/day). It was assumed that about
one fourth of the total number of paramedicals (i.e. 300 staff) would be given these temporary
assignments. However, the exact number of staff would be identified by MOPH during its
assessment of total personnel needs (see above). The effectiveness of these allowances would be
assessed during the mid-term review (para. 5.8) and the system would be modified if required.
3.6          Project support has been identified taking into account other donors' interventions
(Annex 4). The proposed project wouldfinance: (i) computerization of human resource management
at the central level, including: design of the data processing system; personnel training in use of the
system; purchase of four computers; and financing of the system's operating costs on a declining

basis (70% during the first three years of project implementation and 50% thereafter); (ii)
redeployment of personnel; (iii) provision of travel-related allowances to around 300 paramedical
personnel, which would be financed by the proposed project on a declining basis (70% during the
first three years and 50% thereafter); (iv) recruitment of expatriate physicians, if possible from
within the region, to gradually fill emergency needs in the nine hospitals covered by the project (15
physicians in all by the end of the project, for a total of 48 person-years, to be remunerated on the
basis of UN volunteer salary scales); and (v) specific support for the medical school, including a
study on the reasons for the high dropout rate, and 20 scholarships to finance local operational
research for students in their last year of medical school. The recurrent costs that these activities
would generate at project completion were assessed, and can be absorbed by MOPH's budget (para.
4.4). Project activities would be managed and supervised by the Directorate for Health Services in
cooperation with the Training Unit for paramedicals in the General Directorate for Health (Direction
Generale de la Sante or DGS).
3.7          Management autonomy for public hospitals.  In assisting MOPH to extend
management autonomy to all (21 remaining) public hospitals in the next two to three years, the
proposed project would enhance the effectiveness of public hospital management and help improve
the overall quality of Burundi's health care services. Development of the policy framework needed
for such reform will be based on an evaluation of the six general hospitals which were gradually
made autonomous starting in 1992 and thereby maintained relatively efficient operations during the
crisis.
3.8          The project would support MOPH in: (i) conducting an audit in the six autonomous
public hospitals in 1995 and organizing a national seminar on management autonomy (under PPF
financing); (ii) elaborating a policy framework for management autonomy that would define the roles
and powers of the boards of directors of autonomous hospitals and those of MOPH, including the
powers of MOPH's central and provincial (BPS) authorities (an outline of key topics is in Annex 5);
(iii) designing standardized management accounting systems (accounting, invoices and receipts, etc.)
and hospital management training programs; (iv) setting up these systems and programs in the nine
hospitals to be rehabilitated under the project; and (v) computerizing accounting systems after three
years of operation. Standardized management accounting systems and training programs would be
set up in other public hospitals under rehabilitation projects financed by the European Union,
Belgium and France (Annex 6). Management accounting systems are expected to be in place, with
the staff trained, in the nine project hospitals by the end of 1997, and in all public hospitals by the
end of 1999 (Annex 8). MOPH will ensure that each hospital has at least one accountant (which is
often already the case), recruiting one if needed. During negotiations, the Government gave
assurances that: (i) not later than December 31, 1995, it would prepare a policy framework, draft
regulations and by-laws for autonomous public hospitals, based on an audit of the six presently
autonomous public hospitals; (ii) not later than March 31, 1996, it would adopt a policy framework,
satisfactory to IDA, including a timetable for implementation; (iii) not later than June 30, 1996, it
would cause each existing autonomous public hospital to adopt the new regulations and by-laws;
and (iv) thereafter, it would cause each new autonomous public hospital to adopt the regulations and
by-laws within three months of its autonomy (para. 7.2. (a)).
3.9          The proposed project would finance: (i) local and international short-term
consultants; (ii) study tours in other African countries; (iii) training workshops for personnel in the
nine hospitals throughout project implementation; and (iv) acquisition of technical documentation.
Two high-level local consultants would be recruited for 24 and 18 months, respectively, to assist
MOPH in carrying out the activities described above. International consultants would provide



18                                             Burundi: Second Health and Population Project
additional support for the initial phase of designing management accounting systems and training
programs. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that, not later than six months
after credit effectiveness, it would recruit, according to terms of reference and selection procedures
acceptable to IDA, two local consultants to design and set up standardized management accounting
systems and training programs in hospital management in the autonomous public hospitals (para.
7.2 (b)). Project activities related to hospital accounting systems would be supervised by a steering
committee chaired by the Director of General Inspectorate for Health (Inspection Ginerale de la
Sante or IGS), and activities under the management training program would be supervised by the
Training Unit of the DGS.
3.10         Improvement of health financing mechanisms. The main objective is to enhance
the performance and equity of existing financing mechanisms by improving: (i) current payment
mechanisms for health care, especially the pre-payment scheme (CAM); and (ii) budget processes,
including the PEP, PIP, Technical Cooperation Program (TCP), and budget preparation.
3.11         Improvement of the CAMSystem. The original project was meant to assist MOPH in
setting up health insurance for the rural population. Because of the recent events in the country, that
objective -- although not to be abandoned -- would have to be approached differently. As agreed
with the Government, the CAM would initially be improved as a first step towards the eventual
introduction of a broader health insurance program, once the CAM has been widely accepted by the
population and has yielded significant financial results. To improve current financing mechanisms,
the health sector should first be allowed to retain and manage the proceeds of cost recovery (CAM
and user fees). This would entail an amendment to the Communal and Financial laws which now
authorize the communes and the Treasury to collect revenues and use them for purposes other than
financing health care. Other requirements were defined by beneficiaries themselves in an assessment
conducted during project preparation. Based on that review, beneficiaries could be induced to
purchase the CAM regularly and at a higher price if: (i) the quality of public health services visibly
improved, especially with respect to year-round availability of drugs, improved behaviors towards
patients on the part of health personnel, and more transparent management; and (ii) the CAM was
usable at non-profit health facilities.
3.12         The proposed project would support MOPH  in designing and implementing
strategies aimed at: (i) managing health sector revenues generated by the CAM and user fees; (ii)
enhancing revenue mobilization by making the CAM and user fees more attractive to the population
and to health care providers; and (iii) subsidizing the CAM for indigent people through the
establishment of a social fund. Further information would be obtained from future surveys aimed at
assessing beneficiaries' capacity to pay and their reactions to future changes. These surveys would
be repeated throughout the project implementation period to test the impact of price increases on the
accessibility of health care. A study of the costs of health care in the public and non-profit private
sectors would be conducted to evaluate the financing needs of public health centers and hospitals;
the study would also help to design management tools to be set up for the health centers. The
proposed project is expected to produce the following outcomes (Annex 8): (i) by June 1997 at the
latest, the health sector would be authorized to retain revenues from the CAM and user fees, and
adequate financial mechanisms would be put in place; and (ii) revenues from CAM would be
equivalent to 20% of MOPH's recurrent budget by the end of 1998, rising to 30% by the year 2000.
These outcomes are based on the assumption that: the price of the CAM would be increased from
FBu 500 per annum (its present level) to FBu 1,000 in 1998 and to FBu 1,500 in 2000; and that the
number of families purchasing the CAM would increase from 25% in 1993 to 50% in 1998 and 60%
in 2000.

3.13          A full-time local consultant would be hired and assigned to the Unit in charge of
"Planning and Coordination of Studies, Programs and Budgets", with responsibility for developing
health care financing strategies. The consultant would coordinate all the activities described above
and train the Planning Unit's staff. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that, not
later than six months after credit effectiveness, it would recruit, according to terms of reference and
selection procedures acceptable to IDA, a local consultant to improve the CAM (para. 7.2(b)). At
the mid-term review, the Government and IDA would review progress made in achieving the
following results (para. 5.8): (i) proceeds from the CAM and user fees are retained and managed
transparently by the health sector; (ii) the availability and affordability of drugs have improved; (iii)
the price of the CAM and user fees have been increased in accordance with the recommendations
made in the context of the project; (iv) the CAM enables access to health services provided by the
private non-profit health facilities; and (v) mechanisms to subsidize (partially or totally) the CAM for
indigent people have been set up.
3.14          The proposed project would finance: (i) a local consultant for the duration of the
project, as well as several months of international technical assistance; (ii) qualitative surveys on
both the population's financial capacity and the affordability of health services; (iii) a study on the
.cost of health services; (iv) the purchase of a vehicle and a computer for the Planning Unit, and the
financing of associated recurrent costs on a declining basis (70% during the first three years of
project implementation and 50% thereafter); and (v) the cost of an agent and transport means (15
motorcycles), assuming the BPS will issue the CAM. The social fund, aimed at subsidizing the
CAM for indigent people, would be financed by KfW and from the Government's counterpart funds
for the project. It would provide partial or total exemption to indigent people, under institutional and
management mechanisms to be defined in the context of the project; it would not include subsidies
for displaced persons and refugees, since these persons would receive specific assistance from the
Government. It is estimated that the incremental recurrent costs after the project is completed
generated by these strategies can be absorbed by MOPH's budget (para. 4.4).
3.15          Public expenditures. Public health expenditures are insufficient for present and
future needs. The improved quality of services expected by the population, including a reliable
supply of drugs, will require the Government to make rapid and significant increases in non-wage
expenditures in the sector (especially for drugs and maintenance); MOPH and IDA have identified
the increases required in the next few years. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances
that, in preparing its rolling public investment program and its annual budget, it would: (i) not later
than October 31 of each year, submit to IDA for its review and comments its investments and
budgetary allocations proposals for the health sector; and (ii) take into account IDA 's comments in
finalizing the draft budget before it is sent to the Council of Ministers for approval (para. 7.2(c)).
3.16          The objective of this sub-component is to improve existing monitoring tools (PEP,
PIP, and TCP) and to strengthen the capacity of the Planning Unit in charge of their development. It
was agreed with MOPH that a high-level local consultant trained as an economist would be hired to
strengthen the unit's current capabilities, including two staff. This local consultant would be
contracted on a full-time basis throughout the duration of the project. In addition, international
technical assistance would be provided for a period of two years, starting in 1995, with support from
Belgium (Annex 4). The proposed project would finance: (i) a local consultant for the entire
duration of the project; (ii) training workshops; (iii) a study tour in Africa for three persons; (iv) a
vehicle and a computer for the Planning Unit; and (v) the associated incremental recurrent costs on a
declining basis (70% during the first three years of project implementation and 50% thereafter). The
Unit would manage all these activities. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that,



20                                              Burundi: Second Health and Population Project
not later than six months after credit effectiveness, it would recruit, according to terms of reference
and selection procedures acceptable to IDA, a local consultant to assist in the preparation of the
public expenditure program in health (para. 7.2. (b)).
3.17         Quality evaluation and management.  The objective is to assist MOPH in
developing quality standards and norms for health programs and services, and monitoring their
application, towards improved delivery of health services in Burundi. This objective is part of
MOPH's decentralization strategy and aims to build capacity at decentralized levels to evaluate and
improve service quality in relation to patients' expectations. Manuals of norms and standards would
initially be designed for each level of the health care system, supported by several seminars and
working groups led by a Quality Committee to be set up in MOPH in 1995 (under financing from the
Japanese PHRD Grant). This committee would include representatives of MOPH's Directorates and
programs and would be chaired by the Inspector General of Health. A protocol for quality
assessment and management would be designed in one of the five provinces covered by the project,
based on a survey of health facilities (using agreed evaluation criteria) and qualitative surveys of the
population, patients and health care providers. Protocols would also be designed for annual routine
evaluations (of lesser scope and shorter duration) to be carried out in each of the five provinces by
the BPS, with the assistance of national consultants. At the end of each annual evaluation process, a
workshop, including key provincial health staff, would be organized by the BPS to discuss evaluation
results and identify strategies to improve quality and better respond to patients' expectations.
3.18         The proposed project would finance: (i) regular training of personnel and the
periodic updating of manuals of standards and norms: (ii) design of the protocol for evaluation; (iii)
annual evaluation workshops in the five provinces where the project is being implemented; (iv) a
final evaluation of the quality of health services in the five provinces, upon project completion; and
(v) support for IGS through the funding of a new vehicle and computer, and the financing of the
associated incremental recurrent costs on a declining basis (70% during the first three years and 50%
thereafter). Protocols developed under the project will be used by MOPH to carry out qualitative
evaluations in the other 10 provinces with the support of donor-financed projects (European Union,
Belgium). Project activities would be managed by IGS and supervised by the Quality Committee.
3.19         National maintenance strategy. Designed during project preparation, the national
maintenance strategy supports: (i) maintenance of heavy and sophisticated medical equipment, and
related training of personnel, by suppliers; (ii) maintenance of other medical equipment and hospital
fittings by three regional maintenance units just set up and equipped under the ongoing IDA-
supported Health and Population Project; and (iii) routine maintenance of small equipment by the
hospitals' maintenance facilities, which will be renovated and equipped under ongoing hospital
rehabilitation projects financed by donors.  The proposed project would seek to ensure the
implementation of these strategies, especially in the project hospitals. However, financing under the
proposed credit would be limited to a vehicle for each of the maintenance units. These units are soon
to become autonomous or private entities, depending on the recommendations of the feasibility study
to be started shortly under the ongoing IDA-supported project, which is to determine the best legal
status for these units (autonomous public, private, or semi-public entities) and their capacity to be
self-sufficient. Public or private hospitals will be expected to sign annual maintenance contracts with
the three units. These contracts will be financed out of the hospitals' own resources (CAM, user fees
and MOPH budget allocations), and by financial support provided under rehabilitation projects
financed by donors, including IDA (para. 3.24). This last source of financing will gradually diminish
as the first source grows. Implementation of the national maintenance strategy would be supervised
by the Directorate for Health Logistics, within MOPH.

Component 2: Strengthening Service Delivery
Total Cost: US$19.8 million
IDA Contribution: US$7.1 million
3.20         Strengthening basic health care services in five provinces. The objective is to
restore the health services and activities of public health centers (Centres de Sante or CS) and
provincial health bureaus (BPS) located in the five provinces covered by the project: Bururi,
Kayanza, Muramvya, Muyinga and Ngozi. These five provinces include a population of 2.2 million
(40% of the total), served by 11 public hospitals and 73 public CS. The project would finance a
study in 1995 to evaluate the detailed rehabilitation needs of the BPS and CS in the five provinces,
especially the 19 health centers receiving no assistance under other donor-supported projects
(UNICEF, Belgium). The referral system would be reinforced by establishing a communications
network between the hospital and the main CS in the five provinces. The rehabilitation of two CS
that was planned under the ongoing Population and Health Project, but later fell victim to work
interruptions, would be completed. The proposed project wouldfinance: (i) minimum equipment for
19 CS and an initial stock of drugs for all the 73 public CS in the five provinces; (ii) completion of
the rehabilitation of two CS; (iii) a communications network; and (iv) a vehicle, some office
equipment, and a minimum operating budget for the five BPS, on a declining basis (70% during the
first three years and 50% thereafter). This would ensure the ability of the five BPS to carry out
minimum activities. More resources would be provided by MOPH, through counterpart funds from
aid from the European Union, as BPS' activities and staffing increase.
3.21         Rehabilitation of nine hospitals. The rehabilitation of nine hospitals is part of an
overall program to rehabilitate provincial and "secteur" hospitals supported by Belgium, the
European Union, France, Germany and IDA (Annex 6). This program was defined by MOPH
following its survey of hospitals in all 15 provinces, covering rehabilitation needs, the type of health
services supplied, and the required number of beds per capita, based on the epidemiological situation,
population covered, and volume of activities in each hospital. The selection of the nine hospitals to
be rehabilitated by the proposed project has been made on the basis of other donors' commitments.
Nine out of the 11 public hospitals in the five project provinces will be rehabilitated under the
project, and the remaining two by Belgium (one has already been rehabilitated). During project
preparation, MOPH defined in collaboration with donors the three levels of the health system (health
centers and two levels of referral) and the minimum package of services to be offered at each level
(Annex 9). The rehabilitation and equipment needs of the nine project hospitals were defined on this
basis. The project would rehabilitate the following hospitals (Annex 10): (i) two second-referral
hospitals in Bururi and Ngozi; (ii) five first-referral hospitals in Kayanza, Muramvya, Muyinga,
Rumonge, and Musema, where services offered vary somewhat on the basis of differences in the
volume of their activities; and (iii) two first-referral hospitals, Ibuye and Matana, where the number
of beds was reduced because of low occupancy rates and the proximity of other hospitals. The
project would only increase the total hospital bed capacity by 39 beds, or 4%.
3.22         During the reappraisal mission, it was agreed that MOPH would conduct a study of
the nine project hospitals in 1995 to refine needs on the basis of the new (post-crisis) situation. This
study will assess: (i) the current status of the hospitals with respect to population covered, medical
personnel on the job, and type and volume of services offered; (ii) personnel needs, taking into
account the revised MOPH personnel norms and the hospitals' potential volume of activities; (iii)
training requirements; (iv) revised equipment needs (specifications and quantity), based on volume of
activity and the availability and qualifications of personnel; and (v) a possible redefinition of the
areas planned for certain services, especially consulting rooms and laboratories. This study might



22                                               Burundi: Second Health and Population Project
lead to a rescheduling of equipment supply based on having sufficient staff to operate it in place
(heavy hospital equipment might be supplied later in the project).
3.23          The hospitals would be rehabilitated in three phases, at the rate of three hospitals per
phase, because of constraints related to the capacity of the construction sector and the adequacy of
staffing. However, a minimum amount of equipment would be supplied to all nine hospitals during
the first rehabilitation phase, to enable them to resume certain activities. Such support would be
determined by the evaluation study (para. 3.22). During negotiations, the Government gave
assurances that, not later than six months after the rehabilitation of each project hospital, it would:
(i) introduce standardized management accounting systems and training programs in hospital
management there; and (ii) assign personnel to it, as recommended by a study of the project
hospitals (para. 7.2(d)).
3.24          The proposed project wouldfinance: (i) rehabilitation, construction work, furniture,
equipment and vehicles for three hospitals through the proposed credit (in Bururi, Ibuye and
Matana); similar expenditures would be cofinanced by KfW for the remaining six hospitals
(Kayanza, Muramvya, Musema, Muyinga, Ngozi, and Rumonge); and (ii) an initial stock of drugs
and management tools for the nine hospitals. Project funding would also finance recurrent costs
generated by the investments, including: (a) operation and maintenance of vehicles; and (b)
maintenance of medical equipment in the nine hospitals and six additional hospitals which are not
supported by external aid projects. These costs would be financed on a declining basis (70% during
the first three years of project implementation and 50% thereafter). Additional recurrent costs to be
incurred after project completion were determined to be within the limits of the hospitals' financing
capacity (para. 4.6). Activities linked to the strengthening of service delivery would be supervised by
the General Directorate for Health, in cooperation with the Directorate for Health Logistics.
Component 3: Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning (MCH/FP)
Total Cost: US$4 million
IDA Contribution: US$3.9 million
3.25          The general objective of this component is to assist MOPH in implementing its 1993
Medium-Term Family Planning Program (para 1.30). Specific objectives are to: (i) strengthen the
Bureau of Coordination of the Family Planning Program (CPPF) and the family planning capabilities
of the BPS; (ii) improve the quality of MCH/FP services in health facilities nationwide; and (iii)
change public attitudes about family size and the use of modem contraceptives. The proposed
project is expected to contribute to increasing the MCPR from the present 1.6% to 10% in the year
2000 (Annex 8). Such a target may appear optimistic but could well be within Burundi's reach, as
the needed institutional structures to provide family planning services are mostly in place, albeit in
need of some reinforcement. Consequently, if IEC activities promoting contraceptive behaviors are
successful and the clinical and interpersonal communications retraining programs for health
personnel are carried out early in the project, as planned, prevalence could indeed increase more
rapidly than in other countries with low prevalence. IEC activities are thus critical to family
planning and population control, albeit rendered even more difficult to design and implement in the
context of the present crisis. Preparation activities such as research and training, setting up an
information and monitoring system, and preparing standards and norms for FP and all health services
will be financed in 1995 by a Japanese PHRD grant that supported the preparation of this project
component. Project activities for this component were identified in light of the above and other
donors' interventions (Annex 4).



Burundi: Second Health and Population Project                                            23
3.26          Institutional strengthening.  Institutional structures to implement the Medium-
Term Family Planning Program are in place, but need strengthening. At the central level, CPPF,
which is responsible for implementing the program, has hired the needed staff as determined during
project preparation. Skills improvement is essential, however, especially in the areas of management
and IEC. At the provincial level, medical directors also need training in management as well as
epidemiology and statistics, to monitor maternal and child health and family planning activities.
3.27          The proposed project would finance: (a) at the central level:  (i) short-term
management training courses and a fellowship for a Master's degree in public health; (ii) short-term
international technical assistance to improve the communications skills of CPPF personnel; and (iii)
an office facility for CPPF's headquarters; and (b) at the provincial level: (i) short-term training in
epidemiology and statistics and in management of health programs; (ii) international technical
assistance to organize a course in epidemiology and statistics; and (iii) purchase of computers for
provinces receiving no support from other donors.
3.28          Improvement of health and family planning services. Lessons learned in other
Sub-Saharan countries show that the quality of services -- reflecting the medical competencies of
health personnel, availability of drugs and contraceptives, health personnel attitudes towards patients
and their ability to listen and counsel -- influences the level of use of health and family planning
services. The beneficiary assessment conducted during project preparation attested to the public's
desire, in Burundi, for improved health services. Improvement is particularly critical for family
planning services, where negative attitudes of health personnel towards family planning and modem
contraceptives often interfere with service delivery and discourage potential users. The project
would provide support in four areas: (i) improvement of the medical knowledge and clinical skills of
new physicians; (ii) retraining of health center personnel; (iii) provision of drugs for women and
children; and (iv) research. To improve physician services, the project would help the medical
school revise its course in obstetrics/gynecology and integrate FP into its third and fourth years'
program, and also finance evaluation of this reform. Until the new program is in place, the project
would support the training of graduating physicians in obstetrics and contraceptive technology as
well as treatment of high-risk pregnancies. Such training would also enable medical graduates to
develop interpersonal communications skills and better listen to and advise patients in the area of
family planning. In the health centers, the project would support similar retraining courses for
paramedical personnel (six courses a year for about 120 persons), to immediately begin enhancing
service provision to women in particular. The project would also supply iron for pregnant women
and anti-parasite drugs for children.  In addition, a small budget has been set aside to buy
contraceptives in the eventuality of interruptions in supplies (expected to be financed by UNFPA and
KfW). Finally, several qualitative and operational studies would be carried out to monitor family
planning and maternal health activities, study the feasibility of alternative distribution channels for
contraceptives (such as community-based distribution), and better understand beneficiary needs.
CPPF plans to subcontract some of these studies to NGOs.
3.29          The proposed project wouldfinance: (i) assistance to the medical school, including
local technical assistance to revise the curriculum and train graduating physicians, audiovisual and
medical equipment for such training, one month of foreign technical assistance, a computer and a
vehicle for use in supervising recently-trained physicians, and associated recurrent costs on a
3
Provincial IEC coordinators, who are also members of the provincial teams, will be trained in 1995
before credit effectiveness, by using funds from the Japanese PHRD grant, and will then be able to
assist the provincial team with communication training at the community level.

declining basis (70% during the first three years of project implementation and 50% thereafter); (ii)
retraining in obstetrics for staff of health centers; (iii) drugs for pregnant and breast-feeding women
and children (iron and anti-parasite drugs); (iv) purchase of contraceptives in the event of an
interruption in supplies; (v) operational research; and (vi) qualitative studies.
3.30          IEC activities.  The objective of this sub-component is to support CPPF in
implementing a family planning IEC strategy, as defined in the Medium-Term Family Planning
Program. IEC activities are expected to play an important role in changing Burundians' attitudes and
behavior; however, the presently inadequate skills of CPPF staff and health personnel must be
enhanced to help Burundi meet its challenges in this sector, particularly in the aftermath of the crisis.
IEC activities to promote family planning are included in this component because in Burundi, as in
many other countries, IEC activities are carried out by individual health programs; thus CPPF is
responsible for managing IEC activities related to family planning and population control, while the
Health Education Unit (HEU) "orchestrates" the IEC activities of the various programs at the
national level.
3.31          A multimedia approach, which has proven effective in many (including African)
countries, would be used. Lectures and debates, information sessions and workshops would be
organized, targeting women and men of reproductive age, and including both official and unofficial
community leaders whose support is crucial. Video films would target: (a) community leaders and
urban residents (shown on television and used in the provinces during the lectures and debates, etc.);
or (b) people living in rural areas (to be used to test the mobile strategy, as described below). Audio
productions and printed material would be distributed to the BPS, health center, and IEC extension
workers, to help improve interpersonal communications. Further, the project would provide CPPF
with the resources required to test a mobile system for informing and motivating people in the area of
family planning. Proposed operational research would aim to test new methods for motivating
women to use modern contraceptives; MOPH intends to subcontract some of these studies to NGOs
(such as the Burundi Family Welfare Association, or ABUBEF). In addition, modest qualitative
studies would be conducted every year in different regions to help better understand the obstacles to
changing public attitudes towards family size and contraceptive use. Such obstacles would be
identified during monitoring of family planning activities. The maternal and child health program
would also benefit from the results of studies conducted by the HEU in the context of the IEC
component. CPPF will work closely with HEU in planning and carrying out its own studies and
communication activities.
3.32          The proposedproject wouldfinance: (i) interpersonal communication activities and
production of audiovisual and printed materials; (ii) purchase of a vehicle to test a mobile audio-
visual strategy; (iii) local technical assistance; and (iv) qualitative studies and operational research.
The project would fund only a small percentage of recurrent costs, most of which are to be met by
UNFPA. This component would be managed by CPPF, and activities in support of the Medical
School would be managed by the Dean of that school, in cooperation with the CPPF director. During
negotiations, the Government gave assurances that, not later than six months after credit
effectiveness, it would recruit, in accordance with terms of reference and selection procedures
acceptable to IDA, a local consultant to help implement the family planning IEC strategy (para
7.2(b)).

Component 4: Information, Education, and Communication (IEC)
Total Cost: US$3.3 million
IDA Contribution: US$3.1 million
3.33          MOPH recognized several years ago the importance of IEC activities in supporting
public health programs, promoting beneficial health practices, and encouraging families to take
greater responsibility for their health. It therefore developed, under the ongoing Population and
Health Project, an IEC capacity at the central level, the Health Education Unit (HEU). The role of
HEU is to coordinate and plan IEC activities at the national level, control quality and provide
technical assistance to program-specific lEC units and to BPS, and manage IEC activities of health
programs that lack the resources needed to carry out their own communications activities. HEU also
has an IEC materials production capacity, which can be used by all the health programs. A victim of
its own success, HEU has in recent years been unable to meet the significant demand for its services.
The project would strengthen HEU and assist with the decentralization of IEC activities.
3.34          The IEC component was designed in the context of the national strategy for health
and family planning campaigns, developed with financing from a Japanese PHRD grant during
project preparation in 1993. Its objective is to reinforce MOPH's ability to coordinate IEC activities,
produce IEC materials and carry out communications activities at both the central and peripheral
levels, in support of its priority programs and reforms. To meet this objective, the proposed project
would support: (a) the strengthening of HEU's capabilities to better: (i) coordinate and plan IEC
activities at a national level; and (ii) assist health programs and BPS in implementing IEC activities,
while reinforcing IEC capacity at the community level; and (b) the following IEC activities: (i)
promotion of beneficial health practices, such as vaccination, breast-feeding, hygiene and safe sexual
practices; (ii) informnation campaigns to make community leaders and the population aware of sector
reforms to be implemented by MOPH; and (iii) activities for programs that lack sufficient resources.
3.35          Institutional Strengthening. To strengthen [EC capabilities at the central level, the
proposed project would seek to: (i) develop management, research and communication skills for
HEU's staff; and (ii) reinforce provincial communication and IEC training skills, by providing HEU
with logistical means to better supervise and assist the BPS agents. At the community level, training
of health center personnel and health extension workers in interpersonal communications and social
mobilization would increase their ability to motivate the population to adopt beneficial health
behaviors, including those related to contraception.
3.36          The proposedproject wouldfinance: (i) international long-term technical assistance
(two person/years) to strengthen HEU's capabilities; (ii) training in management of communications
programs; (iii) short-term national and international technical assistance to help implement specific
tasks (such as training and studies); (iv) logistical support at the central level and associated recurrent
costs on a declining basis (70% during the first three years and 50% thereafter); and (v) training in
interpersonal communications and social mobilization for health extension workers and staff in
health centers. The Government would recruit internationally a consultant specialized in mass
communications planning, with qualifications, experience and terms of reference satisfactory to IDA,
as a condition of credit effectiveness (para. 7.4(b)).
3.37          Support for IEC activities. Since most public health programs have a budget for
LEC activities, the proposed credit would be confined to financing these activities in two areas: (a)
support for sector reforms; and (b) campaigns to address priority health problems for which MOPH
has no alternative financing (for instance, bacillary dysentery) or insufficient funds (as may be the

case with HIV/AIDS/STD). Support would be given for IEC activities at the central, provincial and
community levels. At the central level, the project would support the production of appropriate IEC
materials, many of which would be distributed to IEC staff in the provinces and communities during
training workshops, refresher courses and supervision visits. The proposed project would finance:
(i) IEC materials for priority programs lacking adequate resources and for information/sensitization
campaigns to be conducted in parallel with the development of sector reforms; (ii) audiovisual and
desktop publishing equipment to enhance HEU's production capacities; and (iii) logistical support in
supervising IEC activities in the provinces and communes, and associated recurrent costs on a
declining basis (70% during the first three years and 50% thereafter).

IV. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
A. PROJECT COSTS
4.1           The project will be implemented over a five-year period. The total cost of the
project is estimated at FBu 9.05 billion (US$36.9 million equivalent), with a foreign exchange
component of US$22.7 million. Base costs are estimated, in December 1994 prices, at US$30.5
million equivalent (excluding taxes of US$7.0 million and duties of US$2.0 million). Physical
contingencies are estimated at US$2.0 million and price contingencies at US$4.4 million,
representing 7% and 15% of base costs respectively. The Government would exempt all imported
goods and services of customs duties and taxes. Local materials for health center rehabilitation and
for small purchases related to project operating costs will be taxed. Costs are based on actual
expenditures for goods and services provided by the PCT of the ongoing Population and Health
Project and from other donor-financed projects in the health sector.

4.2           Project costs by component are shown in Table I above. Institutional strengthening
accounts for 20% of total base cost; strengthening service delivery in five provinces for 54%; the
implementation of the MCH/FP policy for  11%; the IEC component for 9%; and project coordination
for 6%. Project costs by category of expenditure are shown in Annex 11: civil works account for
31% of total base costs; technical assistance, training and studies for 28%; furniture, equipment and
vehicles for 23%; operating expenditures for 10%; the social fund for 5%; and drugs for 3%.
4.3           Contingency Allowances. Physical contingencies have been calculated at 10% for
civil works and 5% for equipment, vehicles, furniture, technical assistance, studies and recurrent
costs. Price contingencies have been calculated: (i) on foreign exchange expenditures, at 2.5% in
1996, 2.7% in 1997, and 2.5% during 1998-2000; and (ii) on local cost expenditures, at 10% in 1995
and 5% thereafter.

4.4           Recurrent Cost Implications. Incremental recurrent costs generated by the project
at completion are summarized in Table 2 below. They have been applied to three cost centers,
which will have to provide for their financing after project completion. The incremental recurrent
costs of MOPH's administrative levels (central and provincial) would amount to FBu 59.4 million,
including inflation, in 2001 (i.e., the first year after estimated project completion). This amount does
not include travel-related allowances for paramedicals working in insecure areas since it was
assumed that such allowances would no longer be necessary after project completion (as these areas
would have become secure). Incremental recurrent costs at the administrative levels would account
for 2.4% of the projected non-wage recurrent MOPH budget for the year 2001 (estimated to be
increased by 97% over its 1994 level). These should be absorbed by MOPH's budget. Institutional
arrangements for the financing and management of the social fund will be defined by the
Government in 1995 (para. 3.12). If MOPH becomes the authority responsible for those functions,
this incremental cost would account for 2.4% of MOPH's non-wage recurrent budget and could be
absorbed by MOPH's budget.

4.5           While the proposed investments in the nine project hospitals would not add greatly
to the existing need for recurrent resources, they would still require an increase in recurrent funding
because current requirements for maintenance are underfunded, and health facilities understaffed.
The net increase in in-patient capacity in the nine project hospitals would be only 39 beds, or 4%;
however, increased salary costs would arise during the life of the project, unrelated to its
implementation but attributable to the existing, acute shortage and consequent need for increased
staffing via redeployment and new recruitment. With regard to non-wage expenditures, quality
improvements made possible by the project would result in a greater demand for drugs and other
consumable, but these costs are expected to be fully financed by CAM and user fee proceeds.
4.6          In contrast, recurrent resource needs for vehicles and equipment maintenance would
increase as a consequence of the project. Because current spending for maintenance is so low, a
figure of 5% of equipment costs per year was chosen to provide a realistic amount that project
hospitals could absorb. This amount should be sufficient to cover the costs of contracts with the
three existing regional maintenance units for regular preventive and corrective maintenance. In
addition, the project would finance the maintenance cost of existing equipment for the six public
hospitals which would not be supported by other donors' interventions. At project completion, the

total annual incremental recurrent costs for vehicle and equipment maintenance would amount to
FBu 80 million (including inflation) for the 15 hospitals. These funding requirements could be
absorbed by the hospitals' own resources, which would include MOPH budgetary allocations and
proceeds from the CAM and user fees.
4.7              Sustainability.  The Government's reform  of sector financing would address the
issue of sustainability of health services and programs. The cost of health services, programs and
administration would be assessed at all levels of the health care system, and the new financing
mechanisms to be established would seek to allocate adequate funding to health services, based on
rational criteria. Improved management at all levels of the health system (e.g., better allocation of
resources, improved hospital management, rationalization of drug supply) and the improved
performance of cost-sharing mechanisms (CAM) and user fees would help MOPH to allocate more
resources to priority health programs. However, given the low level of national expenditures in the
health sector, external financing will still be needed to help meet total financing needs of the sector.
Reforms developed in the context of the project will lead to sustainable interventions in the long-
term.
B. FINANCING
4.8              Of the total project costs of US$36.9 million, IDA would finance US$21.3 million
(58% of total project costs), KfW would provide a grant of US$13.6 million (37%) and the
Government of Burundi would fund US$2.05 million (5%).

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. STATUS OF PROJECT PREPARATION AND READINESS
5.1          The proposed project was identified in February 1991. Project preparation was
carried out with financial support from the ongoing Population and Health Project (Cr. 1862-BI) and
a Japanese PHRD Grant. A beneficiary assessment was carried out during project preparation to
determine beneficiaries' satisfaction with Burundi's public health services, including the pre-
payment health card (CAM). Appraisal took place in May 1993 and post-appraisal in September
1993. Project negotiations were scheduled to be completed by end-1993 but could not take place
because of the October 1993 events. The establishment of a new Government in September 1994
made possible a re-appraisal mission in November/December 1994. The content of the project was
redefined on the basis of MOPH's new priorities and other donor interventions; main donors
participated in the re-appraisal of the project. Some project activities were maintained and redefined,
such as: improvement of sector financing, introduction of management autonomy for hospitals,
hospital rehabilitation, and implementation of the IEC policy. New activities have been added,
including: development and management of human resources, quality management and assessment,
and implementation of the MCH/FP policy. During the re-appraisal mission, it was agreed with
MOPH that activities aimed at establishing an autonomous drug procurement unit would not be
financed through the proposed project, given European Union commitment to their financing. Since
the on-going Population and Health Project will be closing on June 30, 1995, the Government
requested a PPF totaling US$670,000 to continue preparatory activities so that project activities are
ready to start by the time the proposed credit becomes effective. The following activities are in the
process of being completed: (a) action plans for implementing sector reforms to be supported by the
proposed project have been prepared; (b) architectural designs and tender documents for hospital
rehabilitation have been finalized; and (c) lists of equipment, furniture and vehicles are being
finalized. The details of equipment needs (including specifications and quantities) for the 19 health
centers and nine hospitals to be supported by the proposed project would be reassessed based on new
priorities and staffing constraints, through an evaluation study scheduled to be done before credit
effectiveness; detailed terms of reference for this study have already been prepared. This study
would not lead to an increase in cost estimates but to a rescheduling of equipment supply (para.
3.22).
B. MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION
5.2          The MOPH would have overall responsibility for project implementation. All
project activities would be managed and implemented by existing units or directorates within
MOPH, as follows: (i) activities related to human resource development and management would be
managed by the Directorate for Health Services, in cooperation with DGS for training activities; (ii)
the introduction of management autonomy for public hospitals would be managed and supervised by
the IGS (Inspection Generale de la Sante), in cooperation with the DGS for training activities; (iii)
all activities linked to improving health financing mechanisms would be managed by the Unit in
charge of Planning and Coordination of Studies, Program and Budget; (iv) activities related to
quality assessment and management would be carried out by the IGS; (v) implementation of the
maintenance strategy would be supervised by the Directorate for Health Logistics; (vi) all project
activities related to the strengthening of service delivery in five provinces would be managed by the
DGS, in cooperation with the Directorate for Health Logistics; (vii) maternal and child health and



Burundi: Second Health and Population Project                                        31
family planning activities would be managed by CPPF; and (viii) IEC activities would be managed
by the Health Education Unit (HEU) of MOPH.
5.3           A Project Coordination Team (PCT), similar to that in place under the Population
and Health Project, would be set up, completely integrated into MOPH. As is the case for all donor-
financed projects in Burundi, the PCT would report to the Minister's adviser in charge of the
Planning Unit. The team would be responsible for day-to-day coordination of project activities,
administrative and financial management, as well as monitoring and evaluation. In particular, the
PCT would: (i) ensure that annual work programs and budgets are prepared by each directorate in
charge of its respective component, and review their implementation progress reports; (ii) procure
goods and services and recruit consultants when needed; (iii) maintain and consolidate all project
accounts including the IDA Special Account and the project account; (iv) prepare the necessary
documents for withdrawal of proceeds from the IDA credit; (v) make arrangements for annual audits;
(vi) prepare, as required, semi-annual and annual progress reports for IDA, the Government and
other co-financiers; (vii) put in place a monitoring system for the project's performance indicators
and for the progress of implementation; and (viii) organize annual and mid-term reviews of project
implementation.
5.4           The PCT would be headed by a project coordinator, assisted by the other key staff
(an economist, an architect, an accountant, and a procurement specialist), as well as by the necessary
support staff and short term consultants to be hired for specific tasks. Team members would be
recruited through a competitive process, under one-year renewable contracts. A consultant (architect)
would be contracted internationally by KfW to assist the PCT in the project's civil works aspects
(architectural studies, control and supervision of works). During negotiations, the Government gave
assurances that the project coordinator and the key staff of the project coordination team would be
maintained at all times according to terms of reference and selection procedures acceptable to IDA
(para. 7.2(e)). The Government has, as a condition of Board presentation, initiated the recruitment
of a project coordinator, by submitting proof that the position has been advertised locally, with terms
of reference and selection criteria acceptable to IDA (para. 7.3(b)). It also agreed that it would, as a
condition of credit effectiveness, recruit all key staff of the project coordination team with
qualifications, experience, terms of reference and selection criteria satisfactory to IDA (para
7.4(c)).
5.5          Implementation Schedule. The project would be implemented over the five-year
period January 1, 1996 to December 31, 2000. The overall project implementation schedule (Annex
12) provides the basis for preparing the final work program, budget and procurement schedule for the
first year of project implementation. During each joint annual review of project implementation, the
implementation schedule would be reviewed and updated, finalizing implementation plans for the
following year.
5.6          Implementation Manual.  The Implementation Manual would include the
following information and documents: (i) objectives and description of the project; (ii) detailed costs
by component; (iii) implementation arrangements (including monitoring of progress) and a time-
bound detailed implementation plan; (iv) procurement schedule; (v) sample documents for
procurement and disbursement; (vi) terms of reference for technical assistance and training
programs; (vii) key indicators and arrangements for collecting and monitoring them; and (viii)
standard progress report formats. The implementation manual will be finished prior to credit
effectiveness.

C. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
5.7          Monitoring and annual evaluation of project performance would be the responsibility
of the MOPH directorates and units implementing project activities, and would be coordinated by
the PCT. Key project performance indicators, to monitor progress towards project development
objectives and implementation progress, were reviewed and agreed upon during the re-appraisal
mission (Annex 8). The targets to be reached are initial estimates, and would be carefully reviewed
and, if necessary, revised on the basis of evaluation studies to be carried out under the proposed
project. These indicators would be monitored in close collaboration with IDA.
To effectively coordinate project monitoring, during negotiations, the Government gave assurances
that: (i) progress reports on project implementation and outcomes would be transmitted to IDA twice
a year (in April and October), starting in April 1996, (ii) a joint IDA/Government review of
implementation of both the project and Government sector strategies, based on progress reports,
annual work programs, procurement schedule and budgets for the next year would be organized, not
later than October 31 of each year, starting in 1996; and (iii) a mid-term review of implementation
of both the project and Government sector strategies would be carried out jointly with IDA, not later
than June 30, 1998 (para. 7.2(W)).
5.8          The mid-term review would evaluate progress accomplished toward objectives for
each project component and for Government sector strategies, and making use of the audit reports. If
required, the project would be modified based on the findings and recommendations of the mid-term
review. The evaluation would verify if: (a) key objectives are being achieved, including the
attainment of project performance indicators; (b) the project needs to be adjusted in accordance with
the implementation experience; (c) the terms of reference of the technical assistance have been
respected, especially regarding skill transfers; (d) services are delivered adequately at health
facilities within the project area; (e) counterpart funds are available; (f) the staffing of the PCT is
adequate for satisfactory implementation and in particular, whether the project coordinator is
sufficiently experienced and qualified and performing adequately; (g) the system of granting travel-
related allowances to paramedicals willing to work in insecure areas has been effective; and (h)
progress has been achieved in: (i) ensuring that proceeds from the CAM and user fees are managed
transparently by the health sector; (ii) improving the availability and affordability of drugs; (iii)
increasing the price of the CAM and user fees in accordance with recommendations made in the
context of the project; (iv) ensuring that the CAM gives access to health services provided by the
private non-profit sector; and (v) setting up mechanisms to provide for partial or total exemption
from the CAM for indigent people. The mid-term review would also if necessary revise financing
scenarios for the remaining period of the project. The Government would submit to IDA, at least 45
days before the mid-term review, a report describing the status of the items listed above and of
project implementation in general, in scope and detail satisfactory to IDA. Based on the mid-term
review, the Government will prepare an action plan acceptable to IDA for the further implementation
of the project and sector strategies. The Government would also prepare and submit to IDA, within
six months after the closing date of the project, a project completion report as well as a plan for the
future implementation of the project. A detailed plan of IDA's supervision missions and the annual
and mid-term reviews is provided in Annex 13.

D. PROCUREMENT
4
5.9          Table 4 below summarizes procurement arrangements for project elements, by
category. No special exemptions, permits or licenses need to be specified in credit documents for
international competitive bidding (ICB), as Burundi's procurement practices allow IDA procedures
to take precedence over any contrary provisions in local regulations. It was agreed that the
Government would, as a condition of credit effectiveness, ensure that all bid documents for the first
year of project implementation after the effective date are prepared and satisfactory to IDA (para
7.4(d)). During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that the procurement procedures and
arrangements, standard bidding documents, and standard processing times for key procurement
activities agreed upon at negotiations would be applied throughout the duration of the project (para.
7.2 (g)). Procurement schedules and packaging of works, goods and consulting services are
presented in the implementation schedule in Annex 12.
5.10         Civil Works.  Civil works contracts for the rehabilitation of (three) hospitals
(US$1.95 million), and for the construction of offices for the CPPF and PCT (US$0.49 million),
will be grouped into bid packages of US$300,000 or more and awarded on the basis of ICB, in
accordance with Bank Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January
1995). Eligible domestic contractors would be allowed a preferential margin of 7.5%. Standard
bidding documents developed by the Bank would be used. Civil works for the rehabilitation of the
six remaining hospitals will be cofinanced in parallel by KfW under its own procurement
arrangements. Civil works contracts for the completion of two health centers (the construction of
which was initiated under the ongoing IDA-supported Population and Health Project), each estimated
to cost less than the threshold of US$300,000 and aggregating to US$0.32 million, would be
procured through national competitive bidding (NCB). The following procedures would be applied
for NCB: (i) tenders would be advertised locally; (ii) bidders would be given a minimum of 30 days
for submitting bids; (iii) evaluation criteria would be specified in the bidding documents in precise
quantitative/monetary terms; (iv) all bids would be opened in public, with bidders' representatives
permitted to attend; (v) the award will be made to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder; and (vi)
eligible foreign contractors would be allowed to bid. Civil works for health centers (CS) and
provincial health bureaus (BPS) (US$0.03 million) in the five provinces supported by the proposed
project, including very minor rehabilitation works, will be carried out under force account.
5.11          Goods. It was agreed with KfW that major hospital equipment would be: (i)
procured under standardized methods for all of the nine project hospitals, in accordance with Bank
procurement guidelines; and (ii) jointly financed by KfW and IDA. Therefore, major hospital
equipment (US$1.73 million financed by IDA and US$2.59 million financed by Kf*"), and office,
audio-visual and similar equipment for IEC activities, vehicles and drugs (for a total amount of
US$3.83 million financed by IDA) would be grouped into bid packages of at least US$100,000 and
procured through ICB, in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines (January 1995). Domestic
manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15% over the c.i.f. price, or the existing
applicable rate of import duties, whichever is lower. Office and hospitalfurniture would be procured
through NCB under contracts in an aggregate amount not exceeding US$0.05 million. Procedures
4
Under local competitive bidding and shopping procedures, the term "local" has the same meaning as
the term "national" as defined in the January 1995 revised Bank Guidelines for Procurement under
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits.



34                                              Burundi: Second Health and Population Project
for NCB would be reviewed by IDA and would include local advertising, public bid opening, and
clear evaluation criteria; the award would be made to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder.
Foreign bidders would not be precluded from participating. Items, or groups of items, of small
hospital equipment that cannot be grouped, estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$30,000
per contract up to an aggregate amount of US$0.08 million, would be purchased on the basis of price
quotations from at least three eligible suppliers in accordance with the international and local
shopping procedures acceptable to IDA, or would be procured through UN procurement agencies, in
accordance with Bank guidelines.
5.12         Technical Assistance and studies.  Technical assistance (US$5.7 million) and
studies (US$3.0 million) would be procured in accordance with Bank's guidelines for the Use of
Consultants (August 1981). Technical assistance requirements for the proposed project are described
in Annex 14. Technical assistance would include: (i) 88 person/months of support for policy
decisions; (ii) 862 person/months of support for project implementation, including 576
person/months of foreign physicians to provide emergency medical assistance in the nine project
hospitals; and (iii) 383 person/months of support for capacity building. Studies are primarily related
to the production of films, video and printed materials for the IEC activities.
5.13         Training. Annual training programs, including course content, duration and number
of beneficiaries, and budgetary estimates would be submitted to IDA for approval before training is
initiated. Local training per diems would be paid in accordance with UNDP local scales.  A
summary of training (US$1.19 million) is in Annex 15.

5.14         Review of Procurement. Civil works and goods contracts above US$100,000 will
be subject to prior IDA review, which will cover 90% of IDA-financed procurement. Selected post-
review of awarded contracts below the threshold would be applied to about one in five contracts. In
the case of consultants, prior review by IDA would be required for all consultancy contracts for
individuals above US$50,000 and for firms above US$100,000. However, this exception would not
apply to terms of reference, single source contracts, assignments of a critical nature (as determined
by IDA) and contract amendments that raise the contract value for individuals and firms to
US$50,000 and US$100,000 respectively. Prior IDA review will apply to: terms of reference, short
lists, letters of invitation with selection criteria, CVs, evaluation reports, and contracts and letters of
appointment for consultants. Standard bidding documents for procurement of civil works and goods,
that were developed during the ongoing Population and Health Project, are ready to be used for ICB
and NCB procurement under the proposed project. The Bank's revised standard bidding documents
for goods and works will be used during project implementation. The Government with IDA's
assistance will organize a project launch workshop around the time of credit effectiveness, and will
finalize an implementation manual including reviewing IDA's standard bidding documents for goods
and works and IDA's standard letters of invitation for consultants, for use by the PCT throughout
project implementation.
5.15         Recording of Procurement Information.  Procurement information would be
collected and recorded as follows:
(a)    prompt reporting of contract information by the borrower;
(b)    comprehensive semi-annual reports to IDA by the Borrower, indicating: (i) cost
estimates for individual contracts, to be revised semi-annually for the total project,
including best estimates of allowances for physical and price contingencies; (ii)
revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract
award, and completion time for individual contracts; (iii) compliance with aggregate
limits on specified methods of procurement; and (iv) consultant performance;
(c)    during supervision missions, a detailed statement of all procurement undertaken to
date, together with a forecast of procurement anticipated to be undertaken in the
coming six months, with estimated costs; and
(d)    procurement information provided as part of an implementation completion report
by the Government within six months of the credit closing date.
5.16         Procurement management. The PCT will be responsible for preparing bidding
documents and maintaining the deadlines for procurement actions agreed upon in the procurement
schedule. A consultant architect, financed by KfW, will be part of the PCT and will assist national
consultants in the preparation and review of bidding documents and in the control and supervision of
all civil works. In addition, an experienced procurement specialist will be hired within the PCT to
prepare all bidding documents and follow up on all activities related to procurement.

E. DISBURSEMENT, ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS
5.17            The proposed IDA credit of SDR 14.3 million (US$21.3 million) will be disbursed in
accordance with Table 5 below.
Table 5: Disbursement Categories

7. Unallocated                                   2.6
Total                         21.3
5.18            Expenditures for major hospital equipment not financed by IDA will be financed by
KfW (60% of the total). Incremental operating expenditures include (for all project components): (i)
operation of vehicles and equipment; (ii) maintenance of vehicles, equipment and office facilities;
(iii) rental of office space; (iv) travel costs and travel-related allowances; and (v) office
administration and communication. These expenditures will be financed by IDA at 70% until June
30, 1998, and at 50% thereafter.
5.19            It is expected that the project would be completed by December 31, 2000 and the
credit closing date would be June 30, 2001. Disbursements for the proposed project have been
projected to go faster than the standard profile for Burundi (all sectors included), and that for the
population, health and nutrition sector in Africa. The reasons are the following: (i) disbursements
under the Population and Health Project have taken 7.5 years, but would have taken only 6.5 years
(about 15% less than the standard profile for Burundi) absent the 1993 October events; (ii) the



38                                             Burundi: Second Health and Population Project
proposed credit will finance few civil works, so the usual delays caused by major rehabilitation in the
past are not anticipated; and (iii) most of the IDA financing will support sector reforms that would be
implemented by MOPH within the first two years of project implementation. The estimated
quarterly schedule of disbursements is presented in Annex 16.  All disbursements will be
documented by the PCT in a manner acceptable to IDA. Disbursements under contracts for goods
and services or single purchases of up to US$100,000 for works and goods (including drugs), and
US$100,000 for consulting firms and US$50,000 for individual consultants and all operating
expenditures shall be submitted against statements of expenditure (SOEs). The SOEs and all records
such as contracts, orders, invoices, and payroll vouchers would be retained by the PCT, which would
be responsible for monitoring disbursements, compiling and maintaining financial information and
ensuring that the annual audit is undertaken in a timely fashion. The PCT would be the primary
liaison between IDA and the Government for all issues pertaining to disbursements under the project.
5.20         Special Account and Project Account. To ensure that funds for this project are
readily available and to facilitate disbursements, MOPH will open a special account in US dollars in
the BRB ("Banque de la Republique du Burundi"), on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. An
initial deposit in the special account of US$400,000 will be advanced from the IDA credit to cover
three months of anticipated operating expenditures; once the total of disbursements and outstanding
special commitments reach US$1,000,000, this amount could be increased up to US$800,000. The
PCT's accountant would be responsible for managing the special account and would maintain all
documentation pertinent to it. The accountant would also be charged with preparing and submitting
applications for the replenishment of this account, which would be replenished monthly, or sooner if
required. Payment requests above a threshold of US$80,000 (20% of the initial deposit amount) may
be submitted under the direct payment procedure. This ceiling would increase to US$160,000 once
the entire initial deposit has been advanced. The Government would also open in the BRB a project
account to cover three months of Government contributions to operating costs, which would be
replenished quarterly. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that, as a condition of
credit effectiveness, a project account would be opened in the BRB, with an initial deposit of
US$80, 000 equivalent (para. 7.4(e)).
5.21         Accounting, Financial Reporting and Auditing Arrangements. The PCT would
establish and maintain project-related accounts and would be responsible for compiling and
consolidating the necessary accounting documents. The accountant in the PCT would be the primary
liaison between the Government and the Bank on all accounting/financial management related
matters.  Accounts shall be maintained in accordance with sound principles of accounting
satisfactory to IDA. The computerized project accounting system should be capable of producing,
on a timely basis, information needed by management to plan, evaluate and control use of, and
accountability for, project resources. This should include the regular production of financing
schedules for loans and credits, showing funds utilized, committed and available by both category of
expenditure and project component, in the currency of the respective agreement. It should also
include information to enable management to compare costs with appraisal estimates for cost control
purposes. As a condition of credit effectiveness, the Government would ensure that an accounting
and financial management system for project implementation is in place, satisfactory to IDA (para.
7.4(j)).
5.22         The PCT would provide IDA with semi-annual and annual financial statements to
reflect the financial performance of the project. An auditor's opinion and a report satisfactory to IDA
on such statements will be provided annually within six months after the end of each fiscal year.
Should IDA decide that the Special Account should be audited more frequently, a semi-annual audit



Burundi: Second Health and Population Project                                     39
will be requested. The auditor's report will include a statement on the adequacy of the accounting
system and on internal controls, separate opinions on the special account and on the reliability of
SOEs as a basis for loan disbursements, compliance with financial covenants, and a management
letter. The auditor's report will be sent simultaneously to the Government and to IDA. The
foregoing accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements should provide adequate and
timely information to IDA for supervision of the project. Terms of reference for the auditor have
already been agreed under the ongoing project. During negotiations, the Government gave
assurances that: (i) an annual audit of project accounts would be submitted to IDA within six
months following the end of the Government's fiscal year (para. 7.2(h)); and a semi-annual audit of
the special account would be conducted if IDA determines a more frequent need to audit this account
(para. 7.2(h)).
F. ENVIRONMENT
5.23         The long-term impact on mortality rates and the possible decline in the rate of
population growth would have a positive impact on the environment. Hospital rehabilitation
activities would take account of environmental considerations. Improved maintenance and hygiene
of hospitals and their surroundings would also have a positive impact on the environment. Other
project components are not likely to have a negative environmental impact.

VI. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. BENEFITS
6.1          The rehabilitation of health services and the implementation of key sector reforms
with regard to health personnel, health financing and hospital management would contribute to
improving the overall quality of health services in Burundi, while making them more accessible to
the poor, at an affordable cost. The project is therefore expected to help reduce the country's
mortality and morbidity rates. In addition, the successful implementation of the family planning
policy and IEC activities would help Burundi reduce its population growth rate and promote
beneficial health behaviors among the population. The project would have the following expected
benefits: (i) quality of health services in the project area would be judged satisfactory by 60% of the
beneficiaries surveyed at the end of the project; (ii) efficiency of the health care delivery system
would increase; (iii) management autonomy would have been introduced in all public hospitals, with
management systems and skills strengthened; (iv) overall sector financing would increase; (v)
modem contraceptive prevalence would increase from 1.6% now to 10% by the year 2000; and (vi)
IEC programs would contribute to more efficient use of health services and greater health coverage.
Using the letter of sector policy as a monitoring tool, the project would also assess annual progress
made in the implementation of complementary reforms that would be accomplished with other
donors' support, such as decentralization and strengthening of the health administration and
improvement of drug availability, management and use.
B. RISKS
6.2          This is a project with above-average risk. The main risk relates to the country's
unstable political situation; to address this risk, the project has been designed in a flexible manner,
so that some components could be implemented even during a crisis and the project's intended
benefits could be safeguarded; for example, hospital rehabilitation, implementation of MCH/FP and
IEC activities, and strengthening of hospital management autonomy could be implemented first in
the safest provinces. However, implementation of some sector reforms (particularly health financing
and staff redeployment) could be delayed, since they involve political decisions and actions that may
not be feasible in a crisis situation. In case of a continuous crisis, the project would be restructured
substantially as needed during the mid-term review. Other risks relate to (ii) the population's
response to MOPH's reforms; to address this risk, a beneficiary assessment has been conducted and
the results used during project preparation; similar assessments and quality surveys would be carried
out throughout project implementation; (iii) the institutional weaknesses of MOPH,' to address this
risk, project support would include strong capacity-building activities in areas where MOPH lacks
expertise; project implementation would be divided among different directorates within MOPH,
while PCT procurement and financial functions would be strengthened; and the project conditions
would enable close monitoring of project implementation and development performance; (iv) the
weak human resource base, especially the lack of qualified health personnel; to address this risk, the
project would help MOPH reduce the overall deficiency of personnel, in terms of both quantity and
quality; and (v) insufficient MOPH funding, which may jeopardize the improvement of health
services; to address this risk, Government agreed at negotiations that its proposals for health sector
investments and budgetary allocations would be reviewed by IDA annually and that the draft budget
would incorporate IDA's comments before its approval by the Council of Ministers.

LES GRANDES ORIENTATIONS DE LA POLITIQUE SECTORIELLE DE DEVELOPPEMENT
SANITAIRE
A. PLACE DE LA SANTE DANS LA POLITIQUE GENERALE DU PAYS
1.     L'objectif poursuivi par le Gouvemement A travers la politique sociale est d'amdliorer les
conditions socio-economiques de toutes les couches de la population. A ce titre, il continuera de veiller au
renforcement de la qualite et la disponibilite des services offerts A la population et s'attellera autant que
possible A limiter les eventuels effets negatifs que certaines mesures du Programme d'Ajustement
Structurel sont susceptibles de generer de facon directe sur le bien-etre des diverses catdgories.
2.     Le fondement philosophique de la politique sectorielle de la sante s'inspire de la Constitution de la
Republique du Burundi et est axe sur les attributs non derogeables que sont: 1'equite ou egalite de tous, la
justice sociale, le respect de la vie et de la personne humaine, le respect de l'ethique et de la deontologie
medicale et pharmaceutique.
3.     La base de cette politique reste le principe d'une medecine communautaire visant la plus large
promotion de la sante et la plus grande couverture sanitaire, F'am6lioration de l'etat de santd et de la qualite
de la vie des populations permettant A chacun de mener une vie saine et productive. Pour ce faire, les
strategies mises en oeuvre doivent s'appuyer sur une approche multisectorielle basee sur le renforcement
des soins de sante primaires.
4.      La santd n'a pas de prix, dit-on, mais elle a un codt. Le Gouvemement s'engage A consentir des
efforts visant A l'amelioration de la qualite et la disponibilite des services a court teme et A maintenir le
niveau reel des ressources allou6es A la santd A moyen terme. De ce fait, le Gouvemement veillera A ce que
le developpement sanitaire s'appuie sur des mecanismes de programmation transparents favorisant une
meilleure coordination des differentes sources de financement, y compris la participation communautaire.
La finalite de ces mecanismes est de permettre un developpement sanitaire harmonieux, coherent, bas6 sur
des criteres de rationalite dans la gestion et offrant des garanties de durabilite.
5.     Les turbulences politico-ethniques que le pays connait depuis octobre 1993 suggerent un
redoublement d'efforts en vue de mettre en oeuvre des strategies sectorielles innovatrices visant a
contribuer au processus de retour A la paix entam6 par le Gouvernement. Ainsi, la relance des activites de
soins dans les formations sanitaires devra sans nul doute faire renaitre l'espoir de la population par le
travail et favoriser un regain de confiance vis-a-vis des structures gouvernementales. De plus, une
formation sanitaire fonctionnelle est le lieu privilegid par excellence de vehicule de messages educatifs non
seulement en faveur d'une bonne sante mais surtout en faveur de la cohabitation pacifique.
B. ANALYSE DE LA SITUATION SANITAIRE
(a)    Principaux problemes de sante
6.     Avant la crise, l'etat de sante des burundais etait dejA precaire. Les taux de mortalite infantile, des
moins de cinq ans et maternelle etaient respectivement de 110 pour mille, 173 pour mille et de 600 deces
maternels pour 100.000 naissances vivantes. Les principales causes de maladies et de deces sont: le
paludisme, les maladies respiratoires et les maladies diarrheiques. A ce tableau suffisamment evocateur, il
faut ajouter des taux tres eleves de malnutrition aigue et chronique chez l'enfant.

Page 2 of 27
7.     Le Sida a pris une ampleur tellement alarmante au Burundi qu'il represente aujourd'hui une grave
menace pour le developpement socio-economique du pays. D'apres les resultats d'une enquete, la sero-
prevalence de l'infection dans la population a revele que les zones urbaines et semi-urbaines etaient les
plus touchees (15%). On observe malheureusement que ce probleme s'aggrave d'annee en annee. Les
projections faites par le Programme National de Lutte Contre le Sida illustrent A juste titre la pression que
ce fleau exerce sur la vie socio-economique du pays: plus de 80% des lits d'h6pitaux dans les services de
Medecine Interne sont occupes par les malades du Sida; le cout des medicaments pour traiter les infections
opportunistes est exorbitant; le nombre d'orphelins crolt de jour en jour.
8.      Le taux de natalite est estime A 47 pour mille avec un Indice Synthetique de Fecondite (ISF) tres
eleve; 6,9 enfants par femme en 1990. Le taux de croissance annuelle est de 3,1% avec une forte densite
de 208 habitants par km2. L'esperance de vie A la naissance est parmi les plus basses du monde avec 50
ans pour les hommes et 52 pour les femmes.
9.     11 ressort d'une analyse de situation faite au mois de juin 1994 et sur base des donnees de
morbidite et mortalite recueillies par les intervenants sur terrain que le visage epidemiologique a fortement
change du fait qu'on enregistre une augmentation tres sensible de la frequence des endemo-epidemies
majeures suite A la depreciation globale des conditions socio-economiques liees A la crise. La malnutrition
chronique est passee de 26% A 40% dans les camps des deplaces. La malnutrition aigue dans les groupes
les plus vulnerables, particulirement les moins de cinq ans et les femmes enceintes et allaitantes, est
estim&e A 10%.
(b)     Fonctionnement des services de sante
10.    Le systAme de sante est articule sur trois niveaux:
*   Le niveau central qui est charge de la formulation de la politique sectorielle, de la planification,
de l'elaboration des strategies d'intervention, de la coordination de l'aide apportee au secteur, de
la definition des normes de qualite, du suivi et de l'evaluation, de la formation continue et de base.
Ce niveau souffre encore de la faiblesse dans la planification et la gestion du secteur. On observe
un centralisme du systeme national de sante se traduisant par des programmes verticaux, et une
gestion des credits alloues aux h6pitaux et centres de sante par l'administration centrale.
*    Le niveau intermediaire qui est represente par 15 provinces sanitaires responsables de la
coordination des activites de sante dans tout le pays ainsi que la formation continue du personnel
de sante. Ce niveau n'est pas suffisamment outille pour pouvoir accomplir sa mission:
insuffisance en qualite et en quantite de ressources materielles et financieres pour assurer une
bonne coordination, et manque de capacites gestionnaires adequates.
*   Le niveau peripherique est compose par l'ensemble de tous les centres de sante loges dans les
114 communes du pays.
11.    Le reseau de soins est organise sur trois niveaux de reference. Le premier niveau comprend 270
centres de sante et correspond au premier contact avec les professionnels de la sante pour dispenser les
soins de sante primaires. Le deuxieme niveau comprend 26 h6pitaux de premiere reference situes aux
chefs-lieux des provinces et dans les secteurs. Le troisieme niveau comprend cinq h6pitaux de deuxieme
reference dont deux A Bujumbura et trois A l'interieur du pays. De plus, il existe deux h6pitaux specialises:
un centre neuropsychiatrique et un sanatorium. La qualite des services dans ces formations sanitaires laisse
A desirer parce qu'il y a penurie frequente de medicaments essentiels, un personnel insuffisant et peu
motive, une faiblesse dans la gestion et une v6tuste des infrastructures.

Page 3 of 27
12.    La couverture geographique est assez bonne puisqu'on estime qu'il y a un hopital pour 180.000
habitants. Neanmoins, il existe des disparites regionales en faveur surtout de Ia capitale. Le pays compte
aujourd'hui envircn 300 centres de sante. Ce taux de desserte est tres satisfaisant puisqu'on estime que
80% de la population burundaise vit dans un rayon de 5 km autour d'un centre de sante.
13.    Avant la crise, la couverture de certaines activites preventives etait excellente. En effet, depuis
1989, la couverture vaccinale des nourrissons ages de moins d'un an s'est maintenue au-dessus de 80%
pour tous les antigenes. De meme, la disponibilite des services dtait de 94% pour les consultations
prenatales. Actuellement, suite aux effets de la crise sur les services de sante, la couverture vaccinale a
fortement baisse e t est estimee A 35%. Cette baisse est due principalement A l'interruption de la chaine du
froid, A la desorg.misation des services de soins et au deplacement des populations.
14.    Par conire, 25% des femmes enceintes accouchaient dans un milieu protege, les h6pitaux et
centres de sante publics etaient et restent sous utilises pour les activites curatives. On estime que les
patients qui ont recours aux prestations de soins curatifs des centres de sante ne depassent pas 20% de
population qui nt:cessite ces soins. Cette faible frequentation des services curatifs est due principalement A
une mauvaise qualite des services offerts A la population dans les etablissements de soins publics. Cette
mauvaise qualitd des services s'explique en grande partie par une rupture frequente en medicaments
essentiels, une absence de politique de service, de normes de gestion et de procedures de travail, un
personnel instable, pas motive et peu responsable et une formation insuffisante du personnel au regard des
taches qui lui sornt confides.
15.    La crise a paralyse de facon sensible le systeme de sante burundais puisqu'on observe des
problemes de forictionnement importants qui ont considerablement reduit sa capacite de prise en charge des
problemes de sarit. Les principales causes de dysfonctionnement sont: la reduction importante des effectifs
de sante en posl:e (fuite, deces, depart massif du personnel rwandais); la faiblesse, voire I'absence des
structures d'encadrement et de supervision, la penurie des medicainents et la desorganisation du systeme
d'approvisionnemnent et de distribution, et la faiblesse des moyens logistiques et de transport. Par contre, le
systeme de santd burundais n'a pas souffert de dommages physiques severes.
(c)     Financ-ement des services de sante
16.    Les d6penses de sante sont estimees A 7 dollars americains par tete d'habitants. Les principales
sources de financement sont de cinq ordres: les ressources publiques intemes et extemes (70%  des
depenses totales de la sante), la Mutuelle de la Fonction Publique (16%), le secteur pharmaceutique prive
(7%), le secteur prive non lucratif (5%), et le recouvrement des couts dans les formations sanitaires
publiques (2%).
17.    De 1984 A 1994, la part du budget ordinaire alloue A la sante etait de 5 A 6% du budget de
fonctionnement de l'Etat. La repartition du budget ordinaire de la sante respecte presque toujours les
memes proportions: 60% pour le salaire du personnel et 20% pour les medicaments. Les depenses
d'investissement sont A 90% fmancees par l'aide exterieure (1990).
18.    La muruelle de la Fonction Publique, qui ne couvre que 7% de la population totale, avait en 1991
un budget total qui representait 75% du budget de fonctionnement alloue au Ministere de la Sante
Publique.
19.    Les soins medicaux des travailleurs du secteur prive formel sont pris en charge A 100% par les
employeurs.

Page 4 of 27
20.    Le recouvrement des coAts dans les formnations sanitaires publiques est le fruit des ventes de la
carte d'assurance-maladie et l'argent recolte A partir du paiement A l'acte. On enregistre seulement 25% de
la population qui achete la CAM depuis 1984. Cette situation est due principalement a la qualite des
services qui laisse A desirer dans les formations sanitaires publiques. De plus, le produit de vente des CAM
profite presque exclusivement A ]'administration communale. Le personnel de sante oeuvrant dans les
formations sanitaires non encore autonomes n'est pas du tout motive pour percevoir les recettes etant
donne que ces dernieres rentrent directement soit dans les caisses communales soit au tresor public.
C. ORIENTATIONS STRATEGIQUES
21.    L'analyse de la situation sanitaire faite avant et apres la crise montre A suffisance que l'etat de
sante des burundais se degrade de plus en plus. Cette situation interpelle le Gouvemement a redoubler
d'efforts pour ne pas perdre les acquis de la decennie ecoulee en matiere de sante. En effet, une population
en mauvaise sante ne peut en aucune fa$on pretendre A un developpement socio-economique.
22.    Pour ce faire, le Gouvemement devra d'abord elaborer un programme de relance du systeme de
sante avant de penser A un developpement a plus long terme. Pendant cette periode de relance, il importe
que l'elaboration des strategies adoptees par le Gouvernement avant la crise puisse etre finalisee en tenant
compte des effets de la crise sur le secteur de la sante. Les principales strategies qui devront faire l'objet de
cet exercice sont les suivantes: (i) la decentralisation du systeme de sante par la creation et le renforcement
des bureaux provinciaux de sante et la mise en autonomie de gestion d'abord des hopitaux et plus tard des
centres de sante; (ii) le developpement des ressources humaines; (iii) I'aamelioration des mecanismes de
fuiancement des services de sante bases sur les principes d'equite et de solidarite; (iv) I'amelioration de
l'accessibilite du medicament par l'approvisionnement, la gestion et le bon usage; (v) le developpement
des strategies innovatrices de la sante en matiere de reproduction comme pilier de la maitrise des
problemes demographiques; (vi) la lutte contre les endemo-epidemies avec un accent particulier sur la lutte
contre le VIH/SIDA, et enfin (vii) le renforcement des services de sante de base et des hBpitaux
peripheriques.
23.    A l'issue de cet exercice, les activites decoulant de ces strategies devront etre consignees dans un
plan de developpement sanitaire A moyen et long terme. La mise en oeuvre de ce plan suivra les axes
fondamentaux ci-apres:
La decentralisation du Systeme National de sante
24.    Le Ministere de la Sante Publique a un souci constant de decentraliser le systeme de sante depuis
plus de quinze ans. Les actions menees revetaient un caractere isole et ce n'est qu'en 1993 que le Ministere
de la Sante Publique a entamne en etroite collaboration avec ses partenaires des reflexions sur une strategie
coherente de decentralisation du systeme de sante. Cette strategie s'inscrit dans le cadre d'une politique de
refornes sociales et economiques qui se concretise par la mise en route d'un processus de democratisation.
La decentralisation permet d'integrer les beneficiaires dans l'elaboration des orientations politiques et
sociales futures du pays, renforcer le pouvoir des intervenants des niveaux peripheriques, et augmenter
l'efficacite et l'efficience des interventions sectorielles. II s'agit d'une modification de l'equilibre entre le
niveau central et les niveaux peripheriques. Cette strategie se propose comme une reponse institutionnelle a
la demande de participation des populations a la gestion des affaires publiques.
25.    La transformation des roles et responsabilites des niveaux provincial et peripherique va modifier
l'equilibre institutionnel de l'ensemble du secteur de la sante. Un document de politique de la
decentralisation du systeme de sante sera elabore et precisera notamment les roles des differents niveaux et
les rapports qu'ils auront avec les autorites administratives et politiques locales. Un comite de suivi de la

decentralisation sera cree pour porter la responsabilite de piloter le processus. Le niveau central doit
renforcer ses fonctions actuelles qui sont d'elaborer la politique et la legislation sanitaire nationale;
d'deaborer les normes sanitaires; de contr6ler la qualite des soins; de planifier les activites de sante dans le
pays; d'organiser la formation de base; de coordonner la supervision, I'evaluation et la formation continue;
et coordonner la mobilisation et les allocations des ressources nationales et extemes. II abandonnera par
contre son r6le d'operateur dans la realisation des divers programmes sur le terrain qui revient aux niveaux
provincial et peripheriques.
26.     Au niveau provincial, le bureau provincial de sante sera la structure administrative et technique
chargee de l'application de la politique sanitaire nationale en tenant compte des besoins specifiques locaux
et des moyens disponibles et/ou mobilisables. Dirige par un Medecin Directeur de la province sanitaire, ce
bureau va jouer le r6le de conseiller des autorites politiques et administratives dans le domaine de la sante.
Les fonctions devolues a ce bureau sont les suivantes: planification et organisation de toutes les
interventions en matiere de sante programmees au sein de la province; gestion de toutes les ressources
allouees a la province pour le fonctionnement des programmes de sante; organisation d'une supervision-
formation a l'intention du personnel des services de sante de la province; et promotion de la collaboration
intra et intersectorielle en faveur de la sante. En outre, pour reussir sa mission le bureau provincial de sante
devra disposer de toutes les ressources necessaires concordantes avec ses fonctions.  En 1995, le
Gouvemement a decide de doter les 15 bureaux provinciaux de sante d'allocations budgetaires directes.
27.     Au niveau local, il s'avere indispensable de prevoir un conseil communal de sante qui devra
conseiller les autorites communales dans le choix des priorites de la commune en matiere de sante.
28.     L'autonomie de gestion des institutions de soins a ete choisie comme strategie susceptible de
palier aux dysfonctionnements rencontres dans ces structures et permettre de maximiser et gerer
rationnellement les ressources disponibles et potentielles. Les effets de la crise sur la qualite des services
offerts dans les formations sanitaires publiques ont une fois de plus fait ressortir le caractere prioritaire de
la mise en oeuvre de cette strategie. Pour ce faire, le Gouvemement devra mettre en place des mecanismes
permettant la responsabilisation effective du personnel dans la gestion, I'amelioration de la motivation du
personnel, la prise de decision facile, rapide et rationnelle, la gestion efficace et efficiente des ressources
ainsi que la prise de conscience sur l'importance de la maintenance et de l'entretien des infrastructures
sanitaires. Pour eviter des derapages dans la mise en oeuvre de cette strategie, une politique generale de
l'autonomie de gestion sera elaboree sur base des conclusions issues d'un audit des h6pitaux beneficiant
deja de ce statut. En principe, tous les h6pitaux du pays devraient etre en autonomie de gestion d'ici 1997.
La gestion des centres de sante devrait etre cedee a moyen terme a un comite des utilisateurs oeuvrant sous
la supervision du Conseil Communal de Sante.
Dveloppement des ressources humaines
29.     Le Gouvernement instituera une strategie de developpement des ressources humaines dans le
secteur sanitaire qui offre des professionnels de la sante en nombre et en qualite appropriee pour le
developpement d'une politique de soins de sante primaire a toutes les couches de la population du pays. La
formation de base et la formation continue des professionnels de sante suivront cet objectif par la defmition

de programmes de formation orientes vers les soins de sante primaires et par l'organisation systematique
du suivi de ces programmes pour en maintenir la qualite. L'equite dans la distribution territoriale des
m6decins et du personnel paramedical est une priorite. Dans la periode de rehabilitation qui suit les
evenements d'octobre 1993, le Gouvemement instaurera de facon temporaire des mesures incitatives
(notamment les indemnites de deplacement) pour retablir un minimum  de services dans les regions
affectees. A moyen terme, et dans le cadre d'une reflexion generale sur la reforne administrative publique,
le Gouvemement developpera une politique de gestion de carriere de nature a motiver les professionnels de
sante appeles a travailler en milieu rural.
Les m6canismes de financement des services de sante
30.    L'amelioration des mecanismes de fmancement reste basee sur les principes d'equite et de
solidarite avec la pleine participation des communautes. Ainsi, pour completer les modes de fmancement
deja existants, le Gouvemement avait dejA opte pour la creation d'une assurance-maladie pour le secteur
non structure. Sans toutefois revenir sur la pertinence de ce choix gouvememental, les effets de la crise sur
l'environnement socio-economique du pays en general et sur le systeme de sante en particulier obligent A
l'aborder de facon progressive et adaptee A la nouvelle situation.
31.    Le Ministbre de la Sante Publique s'attellera A developper des mecanismes permettant
l'amelioration du systeme actuel de la Carte d'Assistance Medicale (CAM). Ces mecanismes devront se
baser essentiellement sur la gestion des recettes de la CAM par le secteur sante, I'augmentation des
avantages de la CAM aux beneficiaires pour la rendre plus attrayante, et l'amelioration des recettes de la
CAM en lien avec les capacites de paiement de la population. Le Gouvernement mettra en place un
mecanisme de prise en charge des indigents.
32.    Concemant les depenses de fonctionnement hors-salaires du Ministere de la Sante Publique, le
Gouvemement s'engage non seulement A augmenter en ternes reels les biens et services en 1995 et en
1996, mais egalement A maintenir ce niveau de depenses en termes reels par habitant en 1997 et en 1998.
33.    La mise en place de ces mecanismes necessite absolument I'amelioration des procedures
budgetaires se traduisant par la maitrise du Programme de Depenses Publiques (PDP), du Programme
d'Investissements Publics (PIP), du Programme de Cooperation Technique (PCT), et la preparation des
budgets de la Sante. Les mecanismes renforces actuels de coordination de l'aide exterieure seront
maintenus pendant la phase de relance. La concertation trimestrielle avec les bailleurs de fonds se
poursuivra.
L'am6lioration de I'accessibilite du midicament
par l'approvisionnement, la gestion et le bon usage
34.    Le medicament constitue la composante la plus importante pour les soins curatifs. On ne peut pas
parler de l'amelioration de la qualite des services si le medicament n'est pas disponible et accessible A toute
la population. De ce fait, la reussite des differentes reformes sectorielles en cours, notamment l'autonomie
de gestion des institutions de soins et l'amelioration des mecanismes de paiement des soins depend de la
disponibilite et I'accessibilite du medicament.
35.    Pour remedier aux carences des systemes d'approvisionnement et de distribution des medicaments
et palier ainsi A une penurie eventuelle, le Gouvemement a decide de mettre en place un systeme
d'approvisionnement et de distribution efficace, durable et autogere. Le depot Central du Ministere de la

Sante Publique evoluera progressivement vers une Centrale d'Achat en passant par une phase de transition
d'autonomie de gestion au cours de laquelle il rehabilitera les stocks et renforcera les capacites de gestion.
L'objectif de la future centrale d'achat est de mettre A la disposition des populations des medicaments de
bonne qualite, A un prix abordable pour celles-ci. Le Gouvemement elaborera et mettra en oeuvre une
politique pharmaceutique nationale dans laquelle la centrale d'achat s'inserera pour faire partie integrante
d'un developpement coherent du systeme pharmaceutique.
La sante en matiere de reproduction
36.    Le Gouvemement veillera A un meilleur developpement integre des differents volets de Sante
maternelle: Surveillance de la grossesse, de l'accouchement et du post partum ainsi que de la planification
familiale. Pour la sante maternelle, il s'agira de developper une politique de services qui prendra en
compte la sante de la mere dans sa globalite. Ainsi en ce qui conceme le ddveloppement du volet de la
surveillance prenatale, du travail et de l'accouchement, il s'agira d'deaborer des normes et standards qui
serviront de guide A toutes les prestations de services. Le Gouvemement veillera a equiper les differentes
structures sanitaires afm qu'elles offrent des services de sante en matiere de reproduction de qualitd. 11
mettra egalement a disposition le personnel de sante competent et veillera A sa formation continue.
Concemant le volet de la planification familiale, le Gouvernement du Burundi s'efforcera de rendre
disponible une gamme eIargie de methodes contraceptives afin de permettre a la population cible de
pouvoir faire un choix approprie. Le Gouvemement developpera un systeme d'information, d'education et
de communication qui permettra A toute la population du Burundi d'avoir acces a toutes les informations
utiles concernant le domaine de la sante en matiere de reproduction. Ce systeme utilisera plusieurs canaux
de diffusion et sur base de messages appropries, adaptes aux contextes de la realite burundaise. Ces deux
axes strategiques principaux seront appuyes par un systeme general d' information et de logistique
dynamique permettant un suivi regulier des performances. 11 seront egalement soutenus par un programme
de developpement de ressources humaines impliquees dans la promotion du programme de sante en
matiere de reproduction.
La lutte contre les endemo-6pidemies
37.    Le Gouvernement va privilegier l'attribution de ses ressources au renforcement des programmes
de sante publique visant A freiner les maladies endemo-epidemiques qui representent un fleau social et
dconomique. La strategie proposee est une demarche globale qui s'attaque a tout l'eventail des maladies
endemo-epidemiques en associant les communautes rurales et urbaines. Cette approche met l'accent sur:
*   Les mesures preventives multisectorielles qui reduiront les vecteurs de transmission des maladies,
qui mettront un terme A la contamination de l'eau de boisson, des aliments et de 1'environnement
par les matieres fecales. Les interventions seront developpees pour ameliorer l'approvisionnement
en eau salubre, I'assainissement du milieu et l'education A l'hygiene de vie.
*   Le renforcement du systeme de sante pour revitaliser les activites preventives de vaccinations des
enfants et des femmes alterees par les evenements de 1993 et fournir des services de base ainsi
que les medicaments essentiels pour affronter les principales endemies.
*   La prise en charge des populations suivant une logique de soins integres, continus et decentralis6s
developpes par les services de sante de base de l'ensemble du pays.
Pour enrayer les endemo-epidemies les plus meurtrieres et les plus debilitantes, les orientations specifiques
sont les suivantes:
*   Dans la lutte contre le paludisme, des mesures d'assainissement du milieu sont envisagees telles
que les pulverisations intradomicilaires. L'usage de moustiquaires imnpregnees sera promu et les
services de sante seront appuyes dans leur capacite de traiter les malades.

SECOND HEALTII AND POPULATION PROJECT
Supervision Plan-
1.     Bank Supervision input
Regular supervision needs, which amount to an average of 12 staffweeks per year, are
described in the attached Table. In addition, specific tasks such as review of progress reports,
procurement and disbursement actions, audit review, etc., are estimated to require an average
of ten staffweeks of various specialists inputs per ainum.
2.     Borrower's contribution to supervision
(a)    Progress reports will be submitted on a semi-annual basis, according to the
standard progress report discussed with PCT during appraisal (Project
implementation manual). The PCT will collect inputs from each responsible
head of component and prepare the reports which will be reviewed and
approved by the Minister of Health before sending them to IDA.
(b)    Once a year, a joint Government/lDA  mission will take place to review
progress. MOPfl will also submit to IDA for review, by October 31 each year
at the latest, starting in 1995, the draft investment and recurrent MOPH
budgets for the following year, and a three-year rolling public investment
program  in health.   In addition, by June 30, 1998 at the latest, a
Government/IDA mid-term review will be undertaken to assess progress in
achieving project development objectives.  To facilitate this review, the
Government will submit to IDA by May 15, 1998 at the latest, a mid-term
project review document.
(c)   The PCT  will be responsible for coordinating  arrangements for IDA
supervision missions and for providing information to them.
(d)    Mission briefing and wrap-up meetings will be chaired by the Minister of
Public Health and, in his/her absence, by the Director General of Health and
will include all heads of departments and agencies concerned.
