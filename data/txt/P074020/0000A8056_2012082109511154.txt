                         Relevance: The development objectives of the project maintained their relevance throughout the years. They are reflected under the public sector capacity building and governance
                         pillars in the Government's Poverty Reduction Strategies (2003-present), the World Bank Strategy for Africa (2011) as well as the Country Assistance Strategies for Ethiopia (2003-

                         present). The pillars are meant to address systemic constraints in human and institutional capacity as well as inadequate accountability and transparency in order to provide better
                         public service, empower citizens to participate in matters affecting their lives and promote transparency and accountability in the public sector.

                         Efficiency: The program development objectives are likely to be achieved with about 30% less financing than the original estimate of US$398. The integration of core public sector

                         reforms into one program and centralizing prototype development at federal level significantly reduced duplication of efforts by different sub-programs and different tiers of
                         government. Most of the reforms (sub-programs) were able to achieve more than the original program activities. In addition, the operational cost for the project to date is 9.04% of
                         the disbursed amount.

                         The project is targeted to meet its PDO: The project has made significant progress in achieving the outputs and outcomes necessary for meeting the development objectives by the
                         end of the project. It has led to, inter alia, considerable improvement in government capabilities to: (i) raise and manage public resources more effectively, (ii) deliver improved public
                         services, and (iii) become more inclusive, transparent and accountable.

                         The capacity to raise and manage public funds more effectively has improved. The adequacy and predictability of financing is being assured by the increase in revenue collection
                         and improvements made in budget planning, execution and reporting systems. Tax collection has increased from 12.4 in 2005 to 58.9 billion Ethiopian Birr in 2011/12. The Public
                         Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessments conducted in 2007 and 2010 showed improvement in 50% of the 28 indicators and specifically, the scoring for
                         predictability of funds for commitment of expenditure has improved from D to B as a result of implementing cash management directive. Budget proclamations and expenditure
                         reports also show reduction in regional and local fiscal gaps through increased unconditional transfers and own revenues. In addition, the variation between budgeted and actual
                         expenditures has been reduced from 14% to 5% between 2005 and 2011/12.

                         Government's capacity to deliver efficient, responsive and transparent service to citizens has improved: This is mainly due to the rapid implementation of district level decentralization
                         and other reforms that addressed outdated legal and policy frameworks, unwieldy structures, cumbersome work processes and systems as well as shortage of important skills in the
                         public sector. The scaling up of district level decentralization from four regions to all regions has improved access to public services by bringing them closer to citizens. According to
                         the 2010/11 Woreda (District) and City Benchmarking Survey, 88% of the local jurisdictions are providing basic services compared to only 25% in 2005. Similarly, the business
                         process re-engineering has simplified cumbersome work processes, set service delivery standards, created one-stop shops for related services, introduced open work place designs
                         and established complaint handling mechanisms in 145 federal, 404 regional and over 19,600 district offices. Processing time for tax collection decreased on the average from over 4
                         hours to average of 15 minutes, opening files in courts from one day to 24 minutes and clearance rate for courts nationwide increased from 60% to 96.2% during the project years.

                         Improved citizen’s satisfaction with services: The Woreda and City Benchmarking Survey confirmed satisfaction of citizens with basic services. For example, citizens using
                         government health facilities have increased from 50% in 2008 to 84% in 2011 in urban areas and from 77% to 94% in rural areas, respectively. Overall satisfaction with health
                         services increased from 62% to 70% while households satisfied with waiting times, attitudes of the medical staff, and availability of drugs increased from 66%, 66%, 53% in 2008 to
                         81%, 74% and 54% in 2011 respectively. II) The overall satisfaction with primary education services increased from 84% to 94%, with solid waste management from 70% to 74%,
                         and with agricultural extension services from 90% to 94% over the same period. The only sector where satisfaction has not improved is water supply, where satisfaction was dropped
                         from 61% in 2008 to 58% in 2011. However, there has been a 16% fall (from 26% to 10%) in the proportion of the population reliant on unprotected water sources over the past three
                         years.

                         Increased public participation and engagement: Reforms supported by the project promoted participation of citizens in the preparation and monitoring of plans. Membership of
                         Kebele/Village Councils has been increased to 300 to ensure wider representation in the grassroots assemblies. Over 3300 Keble level government/CSO supervision and inspection
                         committees have been formed to ensure citizens’ participation through formally established voluntary bi-annual public meetings.
                         Transparency and accountability has been enhanced through establishment of information officers at federal, regional and woreda offices as well as recruitment of over 10,400
                         Kebele Managers. This is complemented by increasingly opening up Woreda Council meetings to the public, posting budgets and use of information technologies such as toll-free
                         call centers (used by over 1000 users daily), portals, websites etc. This was also confirmed by the Woreda and City Benchmarking Survey by increased number of respondents who
                         know public service information. Based on the Woreda and City Benchmarking Survey, citizens who know what taxes and fees they are legally required to pay increased from 60% in
                         2008 to 81% in 2011. Those who know their woreda budget and strategic plan increased from 13% and 17% in 2008 to 20% and 19% in 2011 respectively. Citizens who know
                         council meetings are open to the public increased from 11% in 2008 to 32% in 2011 while those who are personally consulted on development issues increased from 17% to 20%
                         over the same period.

                         Other achievements: Ethiopia’s ranking for on-line service improved from 126 to 80 and for e-participation from 170 to 19 from a total of 174 countries on the UN E-Government Index
                         done between 2005 and 2011. Skills are enhanced through short and long-term as well as on the job training. In an assessment made on training aspects of PSCAP, 87% of the
                         responses were positive and speak well of the usefulness of the training courses they had taken.

                         Notwithstanding the above achievements, the incentive environment for the public servants has not improved and although civil service salaries increased on average by 15% in
                         2005, 23% in 2008, and 38% in 2011, these adjustments in pay have only partially compensated public servants for the loss of purchasing power. On the other hand, citizens
                         reporting paying extra money to get public service increased from 4.3% in 2005 to 6.5% in 2011. This suggests increase in petty corruption.
