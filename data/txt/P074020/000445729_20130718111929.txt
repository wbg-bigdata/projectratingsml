F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the Public Sector Capacity Building Program (PSCAP) Support Project is to
improve the scale, efficiency, and responsiveness of public service delivery at the federal,
regional and local level; to empower citizens to participate more effectively in shaping their own
development and to promote good governance and accountability. This overall objective will be
achieved by scaling up Ethiopia's ongoing capacity building and institutional transformation

1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

Summary

1.     The Public Sector Capacity Building Program Support Project (PSCAP) is a mutli-donor
and multi-sector operation implemented at all levels of government from 2004/05 to 2012/13. It
was a comprehensive public sector reform program aimed at building an effective state that
provide improved service delivery and enhance good governance. PSCAP was closely aligned to
the Government’s own capacity building strategy to deliver improvements in rural and urban
decentralization, civil service and administrative reforms, public financial management and tax
systems reforms, as well as justice system reforms and ICT applications in public services. While
PSCAP supported reforms and capacity building in these areas, this report also acknowledges
instances where attribution is not restricted to PSCAP alone (e.g. public financial management),
but baselines selected allowed the monitoring of PSCAP funded activities.

2.      The project contributed to considerable improvement in government capabilities to
provide services and empower citizens. The legal and policy frameworks were strengthened
across sectors through enactment of proclamations in civil service, tax, finance, civil and
criminal laws as well as laws that determine the powers and responsibilities of the three arms of
government. Business Process Reengineering (BPR) was widely used to restructure and improve
the performance of public services. Minimum service standards and charters have been
developed for improved service delivery. Skills were developed through short and long-term
training, on-the job training and study tours. The investment in rolling out systems for budget
and account, tax identification number, integrated government tax administration system,
automated system for customs data, case flow management for the judiciary are all improving
the performance of the state institutions in providing services. Revenue from tax has doubled in
real terms - increasing the predictability and adequacy of financial resources for service delivery.
Focal points for citizens and civil society participation were established. To improve access to
information, institutional information officers have been out in place at district and regional
levels, websites have been developed by sectors and regions, and over 385 multi-purpose
community centers and toll-free call centers were established as pilots.

3.      This report is structured into seven sections. Section one presents the project context
during preparation and development objectives. Section two provides the key factors affecting
implementation and outcomes. Sections three and four focus on assessment of outcomes in terms
of relevance, efficacy and efficiency, as well as assessment of risk to development outcomes.
Section five presents the assessment of Bank and borrower performance during design and
supervision. Section six presents the lessons learned and the last section summarizes comments
from borrower and other partners. The annexes provide additional information and statistics.

1.1    Context at Appraisal

4.     Country and Sector Background: The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia was
created by the Constitution of Ethiopia in 1995 following a period of transition after the
downfall of the Derg administration in 1991. The new constitution formalized the division of the
country into nine (9) Federated National Regional States (Kilils), ‘delimited on the basis of


                                                 1
settlement patterns, identity, language and the consent of the people concerned’ (Articles 46 and
47).

5.      Once in power, the government of the Ethiopian Peoples’ Revolutionary Democratic
Front (EPRDF) embarked on a long term strategy of “state transformation? characterized by bold
attempts to implement multiple reforms in parallel; the massive scale-up of institutional
development efforts across tiers of government; and the deliberate expansion of the scope of
public sector capacity building initiatives.

6.      Between the mid-1990s and 2001, the government undertook a range of in-depth
diagnostics and reviews to systematically identify the factors that hindered public sector
efficiency, grassroots empowerment, and accountability. The reviews identified the following
factors, which spanned all branches and tiers of government, and helped shape the scope and
scale of the second phase of state transformation:

   •   Unpredictable resource flows had undermined the allocative and operational efficiency of
       the public sector at the federal, regional, and local levels in Ethiopia. The public service
       was characterized by weaknesses in the administrative and working systems, and lacked
       effectiveness, efficiency and ethical behavior in performance and service delivery.

   •   Despite the success of regionalization in the mid-1990s, Woredas or districts enjoyed
       little fiscal or administrative autonomy to respond to the local needs of their
       constituencies.

   •   Significant institutional weaknesses and capacity deficits were acknowledged across
       Ethiopia’s justice system, including in areas such as lawmaking, law execution and
       enforcement, the functioning of courts, and the development of the legal professional.

   •   Weaknesses in the vertical and horizontal independence of the judiciary resulted from
       lack of transparency in the selection of judges, unclear organizational structures in the
       courts, outdated systems and procedures, shortage of trained judges and support staff, and
       lack of basic infrastructure and facilities.

   •   Inability of the revenue collecting institutions to fulfill their expected roles because they
       were entangled in a web of complex and outdated practices, characterized by inadequate
       numbers of skilled staff, and opportunities and incidences of corruption.

   •   High urban population growth and unemployment, inadequate houses and shelter, poor
       sanitation, congested roads and poor social services, coupled with absence of an
       appropriate policy framework and urban governance.

   •   Dependence of almost all the population on the conventional and traditional information
       delivery systems; low coverage of the national telecommunication network; limited
       capacity, accessibility and high cost of Internet services; shortage of human resources in
       ICT both in number and qualification at operational and regulatory level; and a limited
       amount of data that is organized systematically for accessibility to support economic and
       social development.

7.      In 2001 the ruling party underwent a crisis, and narrowly avoided disintegration,
but created the basis for change. There was recognition that the demarcation between party
and state structures was blurred and hampering the democratization process. Discontent about
the demarcation of roles (where the party was seen as shadowing government and the state at
every level) was a major driver of the 2001 division. What emerged was a political leadership
dedicated to modernization of the state and the party. The drive to professionalize the state gave
a new priority to capacity building, and creating capable state structures at decentralized levels.
Meanwhile the notion of an independently operating party structure was given much less
prominence – in effect resulting in a lot of party activities being subsumed into state structures,
particularly at decentralized level.

8.      The period between 2002 and 2004 represented an important transition leading to
increase focus on capacity building; one in which radically new parameters of state
development were discussed in Ethiopia. Not only did government focus on practical steps to
enhance the institutionalisation of state structures and activity including the separation of party
and state, the restriction of the role of the party, and the separation of powers between branches
of government. It also gave a new focus to decentralization, characterized by local municipality
and wereda-centred development, backed by fiscal transfers to the sub-national level. While
fiscal decentralization to wereda level administrations (with planning, budgeting and reporting
all devolved) had been a stated ambition since 1996, it was in fact introduced very abruptly in
2002. Government thinking during this period also seemed to have placed increased emphasis on
the transformation of state-society relations. Against this background the Ministry of Capacity
Building was created in 2001/2. Informally known as a ‘super ministry’, its mandate was to be a
focal point for and drive reforms. It was seen as the custodian of the formal public sector reform
process which replaced the party’s role as the ‘motor of development’. It enjoyed massive
political support (under a strong leadership) at the time of project appraisal and continued to
have this support beyond the 2005 elections. Capacity building was thus at the core of the
government’s program at appraisal, presenting clear incentives for the Bank to align PSCAP to
the Government’s strategy.

9.      Rationale for Bank assistance: The substantial and complex requirements of Ethiopia’s
state transformation agenda necessitated International Development Association’s (IDA)
intensive involvement for three reasons: (i) managing the demands of rapid nation-wide scale up;
(ii) leveraging the comparative advantage of IDA and other interested partners; and (iii)
mitigating risk factors associated with serial direct budget support.

10.     Managing the demands of rapid, nation-wide scale up: The scale and scope of the
government’s public sector capacity building program were the most ambitious in Africa. This
was underpinned by solid political commitment to overcoming the fiscal and operational
challenges to successfully implement state transformation. IDA financing in the context of
Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) to public sector capacity building was to enable the government
to “smooth? out fluctuations in the provision of bilateral aid resources across regional states
within the federal system, across sub-programs of PSCAP, and spanning a long duration.

11.     Leveraging the Bank’s comparative advantage and that of other partners around a
“single design solution? to PSCAP: IDA had leveraged its experience as a lead or strategic
partner in supporting large scale capacity building programs in Africa (e.g. IDA’s programmatic

                                                3
support to Uganda’s reforms in the 1990s) and had brought to bear considerable international
experience in several of the reform areas under implementation as part of PSCAP. These
included urban management, district-level decentralization, civil service reform, and ICT.
Overall, in Ethiopia, the Bank had also played a catalytic role in encouraging donors—
particularly those with intensive experience at the sub-national level and in areas such as justice
systems and tax reform—to pool their support and harmonize around the government’s “single
design solution? for PSCAP.

12.     Mitigating risk factors associated with serial direct budget support: A final rationale
for the Bank involvement related to mitigating the fiduciary and implementation risks associated
with IDA’s, as well as bilateral direct budget support programs designed to help the government
achieve poverty reduction objectives in the Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction
Program (SDPRP). Specifically, assistance to be provided under PSCAP—for example, for the
modernization of expenditure management systems, or restructuring and skills development in
Woredas and municipalities—were expected to significantly strengthen the confidence of
Ethiopia’s aid consortia that budgetary resources were effectively utilized to deliver essential
services within a decentralized framework.

1.3    Revised PDOs (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
       and Reasons/Justification

15.    The objectives were not revised.

1.4    Main Beneficiaries

16.     The project’s expected beneficiaries were citizens and their communities (particularly the
poor), including farmers and urban private sector through improved service delivery,
empowerment, and greater transparency and accountability of government institutions. Expected
intermediate beneficiaries included civil servants at the federal, regional, and local levels;
Woreda and municipal officials; the judiciary and their staff; staff involved in basic legislative
processes; revenue and tax authorities; public, private, and non-profit training institutions; and
service providers.

1.5    Original Components (as approved)

17.    The project consisted of two components as follows:

18.    Component 1: Federal PSCAP: This component supported federal level activities across
each of the six sub-programs described below, including those capacity building activities for
which there were scale and network economies, and those activities that required national level
prototyping.

19.    Component 2: Regional PSCAP: This component constituted the bulk of the Program
and was designed to empower regions to adapt and implement national reform and capacity
building priorities envisaged under PSCAP’s six (6) sub-programs described below in a manner
that was efficient, accountable, and sustainable.

20.    The objectives of each sub-program of PSCAP under the two components are given
below:

21.    Sub-program 1—Civil service reform: The objective of this sub-program was to promote
the development of an efficient, effective, transparent, accountable, ethical, and performance-

                                                5
oriented civil service through institutional reforms, systems development, and training. The sub-
program had seven (7) major sub-components: i) strengthening the capacity of CSRP
coordinating structures; ii) improving governance of financial resource management; iii)
improving governance of human resource management; iv) improving performance and public
service delivery; v) improving accountability and transparency; vi) strengthening top
management systems; and vii) building the policy and institutional governance capacity of the
four (4) least developed regions.

22.     Sub-program 2—District-level decentralization: The objective of the sub-program was to
deepen the devolution of power to the lower tiers of regional government and institutionalize
decision-making processes at the grassroots level. This would be achieved through the following
sub-components: i) refining Woreda institutions and organizations; ii) training and Woreda
planning; iii) strengthening grassroots participation; iv) improving program development; v)
building capacity for Woreda fiscal transfer and own revenue; vi) strengthening Woreda
planning and financial control; vii) developing and implementing minimum service standards;
and viii) supporting Woredas with necessary equipment for effective service delivery.

23.    Sub-program 3—Justice system reform: This sub-program aimed to promote the rule of
law as well as the efficient and effective functions of the justice system as part of Ethiopia’s
broader democratization and private sector development processes under four (4) sub-
components: i) strengthening the judiciary; ii) revising and reforming laws; iii) enhancing the
capacity of law enforcement organizations; and iv) strengthening legislative organizations.

24.      Sub-program 4—Urban management capacity building: This sub-program aimed to
enhance the capacity of municipalities in the delivery of services, and enable urban centers to
play a more effective role in social and economic development. These objectives would be
achieved through the following sub-components: i) formulating and/or adapting enabling policy
frameworks for the improvement of urban services; ii) deepening the process of decentralization;
and iii) restructuring and capacity building of urban-local governments.

25.     Sub-program 5—Tax systems reform: The sub-program aimed to develop a modern tax
administration that would increase tax revenues, ensure equity and fairness, and encourage
private sector investment and development. These objectives would be achieved through the
following sub-components: i) tax policy and legislation; ii) presumptive taxation; iii) taxpayers
identification number; iv) value added tax; v) operational program, systems and procedures; vi)
organization and tax payers’ education; and vii) customs reform.

26.     Sub-program 6—Information and communication technologies (ICTs): The objective of
this sub-program was to harness ICTs for the development of human resources, democratization,
service delivery, and good governance. These objectives were expected to be realized through
the following sub-components: i) developing human resources for e-government; ii) using ICT
for public service delivery and good governance; iii) developing applications for sectors; and iv)
enabling communities to become centers of indigenous knowledge and content through
community-based information systems and services.

1.6    Revised Components

27.    The components were not revised.

1.7    Other Significant Changes

28.    IDA Additional Financing (AF) of US$50 million became effective in July 2010.The AF
provided a pool of resources aimed at closing the financing gap that occurred due to the
withdrawal of some expected bilateral donors’ funds following the 2005 election and the
redeployment of US$20million IDA fund from the project to respond to the acute food crisis in
Ethiopia in 2009, which required immediate support.

29.    No changes were made to the project development objectives, components, or
implementation modalities, including procurement and financial management except the
replacement of Financial Management Reports with the Interim Financial Reports (IFRs). In
addition, the closing date was extended from 7 July, 2009 to 31 December 2012. Furthermore,
the provision in the project design for in-year reallocations between sub-programs and regions
based on performance was removed in order to establish a level of certainty and predictability in
PSCAP finances, and avoid penalizing the lagging regions that the program was meant to assist.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

30.     Quality at entry: Quality Enhancement Review (QER) was conducted and the project’s
quality at entry was satisfactory. Soundness of the background and risk analysis, lessons from
other operations, coupled with high level of government commitment and stakeholder
participation contributed to the effectiveness of the project’s design.

31.    Soundness of background analysis and knowledge transfer: A rich body of analytical
work in the Bank’s country program underpinned support for PSCAP. These included a series of
annual Public Expenditure Reviews dating back to the mid-1990s that reviewed progress of
expenditure management reforms (especially the 2000, 2001, and 2002 reports); the 1999
Regionalization Study; the 2000 review of the Civil Service Reform Program (CSRP); a 2001
Rapid Assessment of Municipalities; and the 2001 Woreda Studies series. The Bank and several
other donors jointly supported the preparation of the 2003 Country Financial Accountability
Assessment, and the 2003 Country Procurement Assessment Report along with action plans.
During the preparation, the Bank team, cooperating partners and government counterparts jointly
prepared technical outputs in several areas critical to the public sector transformation process,
including a concept note on urban land management and legislation, cost of decentralization in
Oromia region, performance and service delivery improvement, and ICT investments to support
core government businesses.

32.      Lessons of earlier operations taken into account: The project design was built on
lessons learned from Ethiopia as well as international experiences on public sector capacity
building across a wide range of institutional settings. The design incorporated the lessons by: i)
avoiding “stove-piping? through multi-sectoral programmatic lending and involvement of sector
institutions in planning and implementation; and ii) ensuring “good fit? by building flexibility
                                                7
necessary to meet the fluid demands of institutional change and specific institutional
transformation demands from each region. This was ensured by aligning the project with the
inter-governmental fiscal system as a way of prioritizing and sequencing the implementation of
capacity building activities across the six (6) PSCAP sub-programs, and delegation of financial
management and implementation responsibilities to regions; iii) promoting strong donor
coordination to leverage the core competencies of different members of donors through the
donor-government working group, and formalizing it through signing of Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU).The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) noted alternative approaches, the
trade-offs between them, and rationale for the final decision.

33.     Risk assessment: The team anticipated the risks that the project would face, and the
overall risk of the project was candidly rated as High in the PAD. In addition, given Ethiopia’s
historically hierarchical social arrangement and relatively new order that promotes federalism,
insufficient expressed demands from citizens for improved public sector performance, weak
capacity to carry out core financial, procurement, program management, M&E functions as well
as constraints in absorptive capacity particularly by developing/emerging regions were rightly
rated as high risk in the PAD. The ICR team agrees with this assessment. The PAD had also
identified mitigation measures as deemed appropriate at that time. The Table in Annex 10 shows
some of the High and Substantial risks and mitigation measures identified in the PAD, along
with an assessment of the risks by the ICR team.

34.     Adequacy of participatory processes: PSCAP was prepared in a highly participatory
manner. For example, all regions, federal stakeholders and donors were meeting regularly during
project design. Furthermore, the M&E framework was developed in a participatory manner and
several training sessions were conducted for its users.

35.      Adequacy of government commitment: At the time of project preparation, the
government demonstrated a high level commitment to the objectives of the project. For example:
(i) the government’s track-record of supporting rapid institutional change was arguably one of
the most compelling indicators of its ownership of PSCAP and the state transformation agenda;
(ii) the federal government committed and efficiently disbursed significant Treasury resources to
PSCAP related sub-programs over the fiscal year 2002-03 period; (iii) under the leadership of the
Ministry of Capacity Building (MCB), the government initiated an unprecedented nation-wide
mobilization and strategic planning campaign around PSCAP and, specifically, the notion of
“scaling up state transformation?; and (iv) the government acknowledged the considerable
financial and technical assistance gap that remained in rolling out its various reform programs,
and actively sought assistance and engagement from the international community. PSCAB
benefitted from sustained government commitment and leadership for reforms during
implementation.

2.2    Implementation

36.    A significant event during the first year of the project’s implementation was the General
Election of 2005. This was to have a considerable impact on the working context of Ethiopia.
The most openly contested elections in Ethiopia’s history (held in May 2005) were followed by
contestation of some results and a period of unrest, which resulted in violence and arrests. By
January 2006 donors had reappraised their way of working with Ethiopia. What became clear

                                               8
was that ‘business as usual’ was not an option, resulting in a suspension of general budget
support. Many donors revisited their political and financial commitments to Ethiopia as a result
of the events surrounding the elections. In response to the election results of 2005, which defied
predictions and showed that the ruling EDPRF had performed much more poorly than expected,
the government set about invigorating and enhancing reform processes, particularly at woreda
and kebele level. The ruling party set to win back ‘hearts and minds’ by raising public awareness
and increasing mechanisms for allowing for social participation, especially at subnational levels.
For example, the Good Governance Package could be seen as an initiative which responded to
the challenges that marked the 2005-6 post-election period, reinforcing the roles of both party
and state in the enhancement of decentralization processes.

37.     Despite the above focus from government, the project made significant but uneven
progress among sub-programs and with the different executing agencies in the first couple of
years. Activities that were easier to manage such as in-house training on different government
policies and strategies advanced while those that require more sophisticated skills lagged behind.
The initial challenges that hampered even progress across executing agencies have been mostly
covered under the risk section and include: i) lack of capacity at all levels of government,
especially in respect of implementing World Bank procurement procedures, project management,
financial management, budgeting and monitoring and evaluation; ii) centralization of
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) at the MCB because of its prior experience in Bank
operations; iii) adding PSCAP coordination activities to regular civil servants with other routine
organizational tasks; iv) uneven coordination between federal sub-program directors and their
regional counterparts; iv) shortage of procurement specialists in the Bank, which delayed receipt
of no objections; v) reluctance to adopt PSCAP systems because of significant bilateral support
provided to some of the federal and regional executing agencies; and vi) delays in releasing other
donors’ funds. In addition to the initial hurdles, turnover of both officials and experts in the
public sector and shortage of strong local firms with appropriate skills on critical areas of reform
were persistent problems throughout the project life.

38.     The Bank responded to start-up challenges with intensive joint government –donor
supervision focusing on the level of institutionalization of the PSCAP systems and the progress
in risk mitigation measures. This culminated in the mid-term review (MTR) in March 2008,
which provided and several measures to tackle implementation hurdles. These included: i)
decentralization of PSCAP administration from MCB to federal sub-programs and regional
executing agencies by strengthening the direct communication between the Bank and
implementing agencies; ii) streamlining the PSCAP annual planning, submission and approval of
action and procurement plans; iii) improving procurement systems and capacity including
decentralization of ICB to federal programs and regions, changing prior review thresholds from
US$150,000 to US$500,000 for goods, from US$50,000 to US$100,000 for individual
consultants, from US$100,000 to US$200,000 for firms; accelerated training in, and technical
support to, procurement; adoption of a more efficient and effective approach to “bulking up? of
goods for procurement, and strengthening the procurement reform and capacity development
activity of the Public Procurement Agency, and iv) giving increased emphasis and resources to
monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and gender mainstreaming in public sector capacity building
in Ethiopia.



                                                 9
39.     The risk mitigation measures were continuously monitored and adjusted. The team
closely monitored the risks during joint review missions to adjust existing rating and add new
risks and mitigating measures as required. One good example is the risk identified in relation to
possible disruption following the 2010 elections. The steady progress in tackling multiple risks
had warranted revision of individual risks, and the program’s overall risk rating. However, the
two aspects where the team still maintained substantial risk are related to demand side pressure
and capacity weakness in emerging regions. Weak demand-side pressure is a structural feature of
the Ethiopian context, associated with the country’s history and socio-political culture. PSCAP
activities have been at the forefront of seeking to stimulate demand-side pressures, initiating and
supporting a number of processes by which service users demand better services from the
providers, albeit systems are at their infancy and will need careful nurturing, monitoring, and
support. However, in the Ethiopian context it is not unreasonable to conclude that the primary
driver of improved public sector performance has been supply-side leadership and investment,
rather than client demand. Thus this risk, albeit rightly identified as high, has had much less of an
impact on program objectives than anticipated. With regards to capacity, the overall financial
management, procurement, reporting and implementation capacity at all levels of government
has improved significantly over the period of the program, and in relation to PSCAP itself, well-
staffed plan and programming directorates (PPDs) have been given a key boost. Recently,
weaknesses seem to have emerged as a result of staff turnover and this need to be given attention.
It is noted that new impetus has been given to public finance management capacitation at the
national level. The detailed risk assessment is attached as Annex 10.

40.     There were several conditions that had favorably affected implementation and
achievement of outcomes. First, the homegrown technocratic solutions to institutional challenges
were complemented with strong political vision around the state building agenda, including local
democratization. For the political leadership, reforming the public service was seen as a long-
term mission, rather than a brief experiment to appease the donor community. Second, the
ambitious program was initially accompanied by establishing what in government was
informally called a “Super Ministry?- the MCB, with a strong leadership and champion over a
sustained period of time. This was essential in building a constituency for reform across the
political leadership and amongst civil servants and made it relatively easier to drive reforms
through the civil service bureaucracy. Ethiopia’s particular civil service model has therefore
proved an asset in maintaining a fast pace of reform, though it is difficult to judge if this model
will function well in the absence of a strong party or political leadership.

41.     Third, ‘learning by doing’ or experimenting with what works best locally helped to scale
up reform activities in institutions, regions, and localities. Features of learning by doing in the
project included: (i) development of minimum mandatory capacity-building activities across sub-
programs, and prioritizing them as the first in a sequence to ensure sub-national governments
were able to utilize these transfers in a responsible manner; (ii) top-down prototype development
for regional planning and implementation to ensure reforms were developed where capacity
existed; (iii) cross-regional fertilization between advanced and developing regions through
twinning arrangements; (iv) cross-fertilization between reforms; and (v) heavy investment made
in establishing monitoring mechanisms such as the supply and demand side surveys to
incorporate structured feedback from newly created local governments and the citizens.



                                                10
42.     Fourth, the Sub-national focus demonstrated in the decision to allocate the lion’s share of
the resources (80% of PSCAP funds), and provide autonomy to regions to plan and implement
within the framework, was spearheaded by PSCAP, and did empower the right constituents
where services were provided. This approach has been used by other large projects since then.
Fifth, the decision of donors to support a single design and to harmonize their procedures with
government made the learning curve rather short and smooth, and helped in enforcing PSCAP
systems requirements. In addition, the establishment of a complementary Bank-executed Trust
Fund financed by donors (DFID, Government of Italy, and CIDA) was critical in hiring
additional people for providing handholding support, especially in procurement and M&E, and in
conducting independent assessment of reforms, and management of the reforms.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

43.     M&E design: The PAD included a logframe and the project also had a detailed
monitoring and evaluation framework prepared in a participatory manner. Furthermore, the
project uniquely put in place a mandatory independent survey instrument known as the Woreda
and City Benchmarking Survey (WCBS) to establish a wider information base and benchmark
for monitoring changes in institutional capacity, financial autonomy, service delivery, and
accountability of rural and urban local governments over time by integrating supply and demand
side components.

44.     Nevertheless, the indicators reflected some weaknesses. Because of its large scope, the
project had too many outcome and output indicators, and the indicators related to improving
incentives for civil servants were not relevant, as there was no activity directly related to them.
Baselines and targets were not specified clearly in the PAD, and some of the targets were
reflected in nominal figures, which were not found to be the best measures given the high
inflation the country experienced in recent years. Similarly, the one drawback of the Woreda and
City Benchmarking survey was that the demand side survey started in 2008, well after some of
the reforms had already advanced.

45.    M&E implementation: Baselines and targets were further clarified during project
implementation, using largely existing data from the Poverty Reduction Strategy documents,
Woreda and City Benchmarking Survey, and government financial and progress reports. Several
approaches were used to implement the M&E framework, namely:

46.     Bi-annual joint review missions (including visits to all regions once a year) and joint
government-donor PSCAP Managers’ Network meetings, which were used to report progress on
outputs and outcomes, identify implementation issues, and suggest possible solutions. The main
document used for these reviews were the status report of the action plans (participation and
performance agreements), which each of the implementing agencies committed to deliver. The
participation and performance agreements were prepared in line with the monitoring and
evaluation framework, and showing the link between the activities, outputs and the outcomes.

47.     The independent Woreda and City Benchmarking survey integrated structured feedback
from supply and demand side stakeholders based on PSCAP’s agreed indicators under the
project. The supply-side survey collected and analyzed the data from officials in local
jurisdictions on aspects such as financial autonomy, institutional capacity and coordination,

                                                11
service delivery, participation, and openness of the local government affairs to citizens. Similarly,
the Citizens’ Report Card, one of the instruments under the demand side survey, used household
survey in 11,000 households in each round to collect and analyze the views, opinions and
perceptions of citizens with regard to service delivery, openness/inclusiveness of the local
governments, access to government information, level of participation and accountability. Four
(4) rounds of the survey have been conducted and the fifth is underway. The first round of the
Woreda and City Benchmarking Survey was carried out in 2005/06 and established a baseline in
78 jurisdictions, being around 10% of the then total districts and City governments. In the
subsequent three rounds, the sample size increased to 291 jurisdictions (38%), 384 jurisdictions
(50%), and 256 jurisdictions (33%), respectively. The initial 78 jurisdictions were included in
each survey to allow the development of a time series of comparative data. Results from the
survey are included in Annex 5.

48.   Assessments and studies on the project as whole, and specific aspects of the project, were
conducted to improve performance and suggest better ways of doing business to achieve results.

       (2012),                                      are making a difference in governance (e.g.
                                                    participation, access to information, and
                                                    accountability at lower government).

49.    M&E utilization: The findings from the above monitoring mechanisms informed
decision-making, particularly the formulation of future action plans (participation and
performance agreements). The yearly review of the action plans took recommendations into
account to make sure activities that were identified as lagging behind are given attention, and
appropriate financial allocation was made for them. Likewise, reallocations were done between
regions and the federal government in order to allow some activities to be managed at the center
based on the comparative advantage.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

50.     Safeguard compliance: Because of the nature of the project, which is largely technical
assistance, there were no safeguard issues during implementation.

51.    Fiduciary compliance: In the initial years of the project, standard Interim Financial
Reports (IFRs) were not submitted by the project. This was a non-compliance to the
Development Credit Agreement (DCA) and when subsequently submitted, the IFRs showed the
existence of significant advances and cash balances. The issue of large balances and delayed
accountability existed throughout implementation. The timeliness and the quality of IFRs
improved over the years.

52.     Further, the project was required to submit audited financial statements nine (9) months
after the end of each financial year as per the financing agreement. At the initial stage of the
project, there were delays in submitting audit reports and the audit was qualified once. The audit
report for the year ended 7 July 2007 was submitted to the Bank after eight (8) months of delay
and was qualified due to the failure to observe cut off dates, recording expenditures in the wrong
financial year, and due to large advances and payables. However, for the subsequent years, the
timeliness of submitting audit reports improved. For the years July 2011 and July 2012,
unqualified audit reports were received two months before their due date.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

53.     The government will use funds from Treasury (US$ 5.7 million equivalent), DFID
(US$ 7.5 million equivalent) and Italian Cooperation (US$ 1.8 million equivalent) to complete
initiated activities until June 2013. In the Treasury budget for fiscal year 2012/13, the
government has provided (US$ 5.7 million equivalent) to regions, and provision of fiscal year
2013/14 Treasury funding for PSCAP is under preparation.

54.    The government is not currently envisioning any follow-on project through IDA
financing, but has clearly expressed its intention to continue to work on public sector capacity
building and governance issues with its own resources and grants. The government has recently
appointed a new Minister of Civil Service, who also holds the rank of Deputy Prime Minister,
and who will serve as the cluster leader on good governance and reforms. This sends a strong
message of continuing high level government commitment to public sector reform, which is
good for ensuring the sustainability of the results achieved so far. The government has
developed the roadmap for next civil service reform in collaboration with the DfID in 2013.

55.     The World Bank is also using its programmatic knowledge services program (fiscal year
2013-14) to support the government’s public sector and governance policy agenda through a
series of analytical work and just-time technical assistance (TA).This includes analysis on public
sector staff turnover, training and south to south collaborations in selected topics, analysis of
long term perspectives on development impacts in rural Ethiopia, and continuing the Woreda and
City Benchmarking Survey.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

56.     Relevance of objective: The objectives of the project were and remain relevant as they
reflect the paramount importance of a strong public sector at all levels of government, and
engagement of civil society to realize the current needs of Ethiopia’s social and economic
development. They are aligned to and support the public sector capacity building and governance
pillar/component in the Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy and Development Plans
(2003-present), the World Bank Strategy for Africa (2011), and World Bank Country Assistance
Strategies/Country Partnership Strategies for Ethiopia (2003-present).The public sector capacity
and governance pillar is meant to address systemic constraints in human and institutional
capacity as well as inadequate accountability and transparency in order to provide better public
service, empower citizens to participate in matters affecting their lives, and promote transparency
and accountability in the public sector.

57.      Relevance of design: The core design remains highly relevant and has largely worked
well during implementation of the project. Based on analytical work and lessons from other
countries, the project built the flexibility necessary to meet the changing demands of rapid
institutional reforms and of beneficiaries. Given Ethiopia’s uneven capacity across regions, the
project design embedded legally binding “minimum mandatory activities? across the different
reforms to ensure no one region was left behind. The design also incorporated structured
feedback from local governments, citizens and civil society to ensure that the interventions
remain relevant and make an impact on people’s lives.

58.     Relevance of implementation arrangement: The implementation arrangement
remained largely relevant, although adjustments were made during implementation in response
to changing situations. The Federal Supreme Court and the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Development were given autonomy to administer their own activities during implementation.
The merger of the MCB and Civil Service Agency into a new Ministry of Civil Service (MoCS)
created fluctuations in performance of the Ministry as an overall coordinator of reforms and
implementer of civil service and decentralization reforms. The gap in the coordination was
addressed by the establishment of a national PSCAP Managers’ Network, which included
political leaders, technocrats and donors to play a catalytic role in implementing the project.
During the restructuring, there was also some lack of clarity on how the two sub-programs,
namely, the CSRP and DLDP activities should be supported. Although implementing agencies
continued to implement the BPR and the BSC, which were spearheaded by the previous Ministry
of Capacity Building, regions seemed to have been confused by the hands-off approach the
Ministry of Civil Service seemed to have taken during the restructuring. The Ministry later
clarified that now the reforms are rolled out, it would like to see federal and regional
implementers to play a more pro-active role. The recent appointment of the Deputy Prime
Minister responsible for good governance and reforms as a Minister of Civil Service Ministry is
a step in the right direction to demonstrate that the public sector and governance reforms extend
beyond the normal technical remit of a single federal Ministry. It showed sustained commitment
and leadership at the highest level of government and re-emphasized the integrated approach the
country was pursuing for a good part of the project life. Overall, adopting the implementation


                                                14
  arrangements, the request for additional financing, and reallocation of resources between federal
  and regional levels ensured the relevance of the design throughout the project.

  59.   Rating: Considering the above factors, the relevance of objectives, design, and
  implementation is rated as High.

  3.2      Achievement of Project Development Objectives

  Rating: Satisfactory

  60.     The project was successful in achieving its objectives. As mentioned in the results
  analysis section and Annex 2, outcome and output targets that enhance the overall quality of
  federal, regional and local institutions were met substantially. In summary, out of 16 PDO level
  indicators, 9 were fully achieved or exceeded, four (4) were substantially achieved, and only
  three (3) were not achieved. Similarly, out of 27 intermediate indicators, 22 (or 81%) were fully
  achieved or exceeded, three (3) were substantially achieved, one (1) was partially achieved, and
  one (1) was not achieved. Figure 1 below summarizes the extent to achievements of all the six
  areas of PDO level outcomes. Out of the six thematic areas of outcomes, only one (outcome 4)
  on enhanced incentives for civil servants was not achieved. There was significant improvement
  in public financial management in terms of predictability of financial flows to subnational levels,
  improved inclusiveness and transparency in planning, improved revenue administration and
  fiscal autonomy, especially at subnational levels, as well as increased transparency and
  accountability, though petty corruption seems to have increased.

Objective 1: Improving the scale, efficiency, and responsiveness of public service delivery at
the federal, regional, and local level

61.     The capacity to raise and manage public funds more effectively has improved: The
adequacy and predictability of financing has been ameliorated by the increase in revenue
collection and improvements made in budget planning, execution and reporting systems. Tax
collection has increased nominally from 12.4 billion Ethiopian Birr in 2005 to 90.8 billion
Ethiopian Birr in 2011/12, which is over double in real terms. The tax to GDP ratio has improved
from 11.6% in 2005 to 12.5% in 2012. The Woreda and City Benchmarking Survey (supply side)
shows that the percentage of local jurisdictions that have shown efficiency and
comprehensiveness of accounting and auditing procedures increased from 30% in 2005 to 85%
in 2011 survey. The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessments
conducted in 2007 and 2010 also confirmed improvement in 50% of the 28 indicators.

62.     Government's capacity to deliver efficient, responsive and transparent service to citizens
has improved: This is due to the rapid implementation of district level decentralization and other
reforms that have updated legal and policy frameworks, unwieldy structures, cumbersome work
processes and systems, as well as shortages of important skills in the public sector. The scaling
up of district level decentralization from a baseline of four (4) regions to all regions has
improved access to and responsiveness of the public services by bringing them closer to citizens.
The decentralization is supported by enabling legal frameworks (Constitution, Proclamations)
and restructuring of lower administrative units. According to the 2010/11 Woreda and City
Benchmarking Survey, 88% of the local jurisdictions are providing basic services compared to
only 25% in 2005. BPR has also simplified cumbersome work processes, set service delivery
standards, created one-stop shops for related services, introduced open work place designs, and
established complaint handling mechanisms in 145 federal, 404 regional, and over 19,600 district
offices from a baseline of 11 ministries at the federal level. Efficiencies in processing time and
unit cost have been seen across sectors, including in the courts, land cultivation, tax collection,
solid waste management, health services and primary education.

63.     E-Government Index: Ethiopia’s ranking for online service improved from 126 to 80 and
for e-participation from 170 to 90 from a total of 174 countries on the UN E-Government Index
done between 2005 and 2011 following the expansion of both infrastructure and applications that
enhance service delivery and transparency.

64.     Skills: Skills were strengthened through on-the-job training, study tours and short and
long-term distance training at Diploma, BA, MA, and PhD level. The long term training has
significantly increased the number of qualified civil servants and leaders at sub-national level.
Some examples include the 2,000 urban management graduates at Masters’ level and two (2) at
PhD level, over 500at MA and BA in taxation and customs, as well as over 10,600 MA, BA and
diploma level graduates in a range of subjects including leadership, accounting, public
administration, and law. A huge number of short-term training courses and sensitization
workshops have also been delivered by each sub-program on new laws, directives, working
systems and reforms, as well as to citizens and taxpayers. For instance, the CSRP delivered
training to over 736,207; the District Level Decentralization Program (DLDP) to over 7,743,400,
over 2 million in Oromiya region alone); the JSRP to over 159,290; the UMCBP to over
216,240; the ICT to over 140,450; the Tax Systems Reform Program (TSRP) to over 307,080

                                                17
(excluding taxpayer education using different media) and the Expenditure Management and
Control Program (EMCP) to over 45,500. In an assessment made on training aspects of PSCAP,
87% of the responses were positive and spoke well of the usefulness of the training courses they
had taken.

65.     There is an improved citizens’ satisfaction with services: The Woreda and City
Benchmarking Survey confirmed that satisfaction of citizens using government health facilities
has increased from 50% in 2008 to 84% in 2011 in urban areas, and from 77% to 94% in rural
areas, respectively. Overall satisfaction with health services increased from 62% to 70%, while
households satisfied with waiting times, attitudes of the medical staff, and availability of drugs
has also increased. The overall satisfaction with primary education services increased from 84%
to 94%, with solid waste management from 70% to 74%, and with agricultural extension services
from 90% to 94% over the same period. Even for water supply, where satisfaction had dropped
from 61% in 2008 to 58% in 2011, there is marked fall (from 26% to 10%) in the proportion of
the population who rely on unprotected water sources over the same period.

Objective 2: Empowering citizens to participate more effectively in shaping their own
development

66.    There is increased public participation and engagement in preparation and monitoring of
plans, particularly at lower levels of government. This was initiated mainly through
implementation of the good governance package that was rolled out to improve inclusion and
accountability.

67.      Necessary structures were established: At regional, Woreda, municipal and Kebele level,
the good governance package (GGP) has created and/or strengthened pertinent structures to
enable greater inclusion. These include: i) expanding the number of Kebele council members to
300 in the bigger regions and 70 in developing regions in order to ensure wider representation in
grassroots assemblies; ii) establishing over 16,660 Kebele inspection and supervision teams
consisting of Kebele level civil society organizations and council members charged with
ensuring participation of citizens in planning as well as monitoring through public meetings; and
iii) establishing bi-annual public meetings with communities on voluntary basis. However, given
the dominance of the ruling party at all levels of government, and its grass root mass
membership, participation by citizens has to be defined in this context, with no certainty that
participation is done on free volition and as opened as possible.

68.     Direct participation in service delivery: Citizens are more and more empowered to
engage directly on service delivery, including on management of community tele-centers,
community policing, social courts, and small scale infrastructure development. Under PSCAP,
153 multi-purpose community centers were established across the country with community
ownership. Currently, these centers are offering employment opportunities to an average of 3-5
community members, and are providing access to diverse ICT services including basic computer
training at a reasonable cost. Similarly, over 15,000 social courts, and a large number of
community development and community policing committees were established/revamped.

69.   Participation at federal level: The MoCS has initiated consultations on the reforms with
top management and civil servants working in different sectors and on service delivery with

                                               18
representatives of Civil Society Organization (CSOs), the private sector and citizens. The
feedback received from citizens’ groups on service delivery and related aspects is forwarded to
the relevant offices for action, and is closely followed-up by the MoCS.

Objective 3: Promoting good governance and accountability

70.   Horizontal accountability mechanisms or checks and balances were established to
enhance transparency and accountability.

71.     Establishment of systems and structures for improved sub-national governance: The
evidence from the field shows that service standards were developed in service outlets as part of
the BPR process, and are now being formalized through the Citizens Charter. The review of
GGP by independent consultants has established the creation of new institutional arrangements
that did not exist previously to expedite inclusion, transparency and accountability. This
includes: i) the deployment of over 15,400 trained Kebele managers, designated as fulltime local
government employees to serve as the secretariat for the Council, the main point of contract to
provide information to citizens, responsible for compiling Kebele plan, and handling complaints;
ii) establishment of information and complaint handling focal points at Woreda and regional
level; and iii) establishment of over 690 information counters at all levels of courts to provide
case-related information and a wide range of information about the courts, including court
judgments.

72.    ICT is increasingly being used to enhance citizens’ access to government information and
services. Call centers have been established for 21 offices - in Addis Ababa (9), Oromia (6) and
SNNPR (6) - as well as for the federal Supreme Court, which make use of toll free numbers with
an average of 1,000 calls per day. Similarly, the national government portal is providing
information to internal and external users and is being visited by over 7,000 users monthly.
Overall, 162 websites have been developed at regional offices to serve a similar purpose.

73.     Citizens’ awareness on government services is increasing: This was confirmed by the
Woreda and City Benchmarking Survey through increased number of respondents who know
such things as legal requirements relating to payment of taxes, their Woreda budgets and
strategic plans, and which Woreda meetings are open to the public. In the 2011 Woreda and City
Benchmarking Citizens’ Report Card Survey, 49% of the respondents think an ordinary person
can do something to hold local government leaders to account, and this showed a 2% increase
from 2010.

74.     Improvement in dispute resolution mechanisms: The judiciary has made significant
progress over the past ten years. Courts have improved records management systems and
introduced court management and decision support systems. Video conferencing (VC) facilities,
non-existent in 2005, now exist in 229 courts, clearing over 36,000 cases and thus improving
access and reducing the cost of justice. Access to justice has also improved by increasing use of
alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and mobile courts. Legal awareness to the public is
also provided in different media. The average clearance rate has improved from less than 60% in
2005 to 98% in 2012.



                                               19
Progress on retaining skilled and professional personnel has been slow and remains a
challenge.

75.     Notwithstanding the above achievements, the challenges of attracting, motivating and
retaining sound professionals in the public service remain. In the last two years, the government
has taken a number of human resource management and development initiatives with the support
of PSCAP, such as the development of job evaluation and grading, the introduction of balanced
score card performance management system, the development of a human resources
management information system, and development of a code of conduct for the civil service. In
order to help the Government to better understand the causes of staff turnover, the World Bank is
undertaking a study of the problem. The report will inform the Government’s policy and actions
to address the challenge. Similarly, the project has been successful in achieving its target of
laying the foundation for voluntary citizens’ participation through the establishment of systems
and enhanced awareness of citizens and public sector accountability through development of
service standards which are being formalized through citizen’s charters. However, given the
dominance of party structures and leadership at all levels of government, free and non-partisan
active citizenry will require more time and careful nurturing, monitoring, and support;
particularly given citizens widespread preference to keep out of politics because of historical
experience with local state actors. Both the Woreda and City Benchmarking and the 2nd
Corruption survey acknowledged corruption remains a problem in the country and also
confirmed that much of the corruption is petty corruption within the bureaucracy. Other studies
also noted that in the absence of the reform program, it is probable that petty corruption would
have been much higher. However, corruption is not the top problem or challenge faced by
citizens.

76.    For details on Outcome and Output Indicators, see Results Framework Analysis (Section
F, Data Sheet).

3.3    Efficiency

Sub-rating: Satisfactory

77.     Annex 4 of the PAD notes that quantitative analysis of economic return is not applicable
for this project. Nevertheless, there were operational and administrative efficiencies that are
worth noting, and which came as a result of design choices and the actual implementation
approaches. These have significantly reduced duplication of efforts by different sub-programs
and different tiers of government, and strengthened local institutional capacity and ownership in
a sustainable and efficient manner. Savings have also been made both in time and cost of
delivery some services to citizens.

78.    Use of public sector training institutions to increase in-house trainers from different
organizations through training of trainers (TOT) and establishing courses for critical skills in the
public sector: The government made strategic use of the Ethiopia Management Institute and
Ethiopia Civil Service University to produce 83 trainers/reform outreach team who went to
organizations and regions to transfer skills and create awareness on reforms within a short time.
This has enabled the government to deepen the reform country-wide within a short time and
saved money by avoiding mass traveling of civil servants to central training institutions.

                                                20
Similarly, the establishment of courses on urban management, tax and customs in Ethiopia has
reduced the cost of training overseas significantly. For instance, it used to cost the government
US$ 18,000 to send one civil servant overseas to get Masters level training on urban
management. Currently, as a result of establishing the course locally, over 2,544 civil servants
have been trained on urban management at Masters level, and this has saved the government
US$35.5 million in the last four (4) years and reduced the shortage of urban professionals
significantly. Similarly, over 500 officers were trained locally on tax and customs at diploma,
BA and masters level, and are serving the government indifferent capacities.

79.     Use of VC assisted meetings and training and other automations: The investment in
Video Conferencing (VC) infrastructure made by the project has resulted in huge savings by
allowing meetings and training sessions to happen in duty stations, thereby obviating the need
for civil servants to travel away from their domiciles. The government has saved US$ 13 million
from travel, accommodation and per-diem as a result of multi-point video connection for an
average of 174,000 participants annually. Similarly, huge savings have come from automation of
services and processes. For instance, the Oromia Regional State Communication Office has
saved about US$113,000 using a Management Information System (MIS) that reduced
consumption of paper, fax and video cassettes. Similarly, the Ministry of Education has saved
over US$400,000 annually by using an automated national exam registration system instead of
importing special registration paper.

80.     Centralizing capacity building activities that require national level prototyping at federal
level has brought about significant savings by leveraging the relatively high skilled labor at the
federal level for complex prototypes and creating consistency across tiers of government. This
approach, complemented with the administrative autonomy provided to the sub-national
governments to plan and implement these prototypes, has also proved to secure value for money
because they are also the right people to reconcile the prototype with the specific institutional
demands and context.

81.     Managing operational costs: Based on the latest Interim Financing Report (IFR), the
operational cost for the project was 7.6%. This is relatively low compared to similar projects, and
is efficient, particularly given its outreach in terms of sectors, implementing agencies and
different tiers of government. It shows the discipline exercised by almost all the implementing
agencies. A breakdown of operational costs by implementing agency shows some variations. The
bigger regions maintained operational cost below 2%, while the other smaller regions maintained
such costs at between 3-7%. Harari, the smallest of all the regions, has spent 10.7% in
operational costs, which is the highest among regions.

82.    For additional details see Annex 3.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

       Rating: Satisfactory.

83.     Relevance: As explained in Section 3.1, the relevance of objectives, design, and
implementation is rated as Satisfactory. Achievement of PDOs: As explained in Section 3.2, the
project has many satisfactory and highly satisfactory achievements to its credit: For example, the

                                                21
project was successful in achieving its objectives of improving the scale, efficiency, and
responsiveness of public service delivery at federal, regional and local level, empowering
citizens to participate more effectively in shaping their own development, and promoting good
governance and accountability. Out of 16 PDO-level indicators, 9 were fully achieved or
exceeded, four (4) were substantially achieved, and only three (3) were not achieved. Similarly,
out of 27 intermediate indicators, 22 were fully achieved or exceeded, three (3) were
substantially achieved, one (1) is partially achieved, and one (1) was not achieved. Thus, based
on the extent of outcome of the project, the achievement of PDOs is rated as Satisfactory.

84.     Efficiency: Despite the lack of data for more rigorous analysis of efficiency issues, the
various examples shown in Section 3.3 and Annex 3 have demonstrated that there were
operational and administrative efficiencies which came as a result of design choices and the
actual implementation approaches employed under the project. Based on the above factors and
the discussion in sections 3.1–3.3, the overall outcome is rated Satisfactory.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)    Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development

85.      Poverty impacts: The project had a positive impact on poverty in a number of ways. First,
the micro and small enterprise strategy of Southern Region supported by the project has become
the main government strategy for urban poverty reduction. The strategy targets unemployed
young men and women and provided various assistance in order to help them engage in business
activities. Second, ICT incubation centers in four (4) regional states have resulted in the creation
of jobs for 83 young people organized in 23 micro and small enterprises (MSEs). Third, the
housing strategy supported by the project has been implemented in major cities of the country to
address the housing needs of low income people. Fourth, poor people are getting services at a
lower cost. For example, because of VC facilities, instead of travelling to distant places to attend
court proceedings, people are now able to attend at their nearest VC-equipped location. Similarly,
poor people are getting court services using the toll free calls, thus they are able to save time in
traveling, and reduce the cost. For instance, in Oromia Regional State, the 2024 e-litigation users
from two centers saved US$ 25,000, while toll-free callers collectively saved US$1.2 million.
Also proximity of service facilities which resulted from decentralization is seen by citizens as
important in reducing time and financial cost for the poor. 88% of the local jurisdictions
surveyed in 2011 WCBS are providing basic services (health, education, water supply) as a result
of devolution of power, thus improving access to services. The poor also made use of social
courts due to the smaller amounts of money required and the oral nature of the lower courts.

86.     Fifth, after receiving computer training from community centers at a reasonable cost,
many unemployed people have succeeded in getting employed both in public and private sectors.
In addition, over 600 youth, women, and disabled people are managing the multi-purpose tele-
centers.

87.     Gender aspects: Gender-related activities, including gender-responsive recruitment and
training mechanisms, were implemented to increase the number of women in the public sector
and create awareness of gender issues amongst policy makers and civil servants. As a result,
there was an increase in female recruitment between 2004 and 2010 by 114%. The percentage

                                                22
increase of female recruitment before the project (between 1998 and 2004) was only 42%.
Similarly, there was an increase in the number of women in leadership positions at Kebele and
Woreda levels.

88.     Social development: The institutionalization of participatory planning, particularly at
Kebele level provides opportunity and voice for the poor in decision making processes. PSCAP
has made contribution to cross cutting issues such as HIV/AIDS, environment, gender, etc. In
terms of environment, UMCBP has supported urban greenery activities in Tigray and in Amhara;
it has supported a study on environmental protection.

(b)    Institutional change/Strengthening

89.     The project also resulted in a substantial institutional development impact in the
following areas. First, strategic planning was the first management tool introduced into the civil
service. Now all civil service institutions develop strategic plans as a regular procedure. These
plans are aligned with the budget and, most importantly, owned by Ministers. The Balanced
Score Card (BSC) provides an opportunity to embed strategic management in organizations.
Second, Ministerial-level Steering Committee led by the Ministry of Federal Affairs (MoFA) has
been established, which meets quarterly to provide direction for the support to the developing
regions. Its membership comprises the Ministers of Health, Education, Water, Agriculture,
Women’s Affairs, Civil Service, Finance and Small and Medium Enterprises. The Steering
Committee is supported by a technical committee, which convenes on a monthly basis. The
MoCS has commissioned the Ethiopia Management Institute and the Ethiopia Civil Service
University to run a training of trainers program and then provide the on-job coaching and support.
Third, each of the four emerging regions has been formally twinned with one of the developed
regions, which are responsible for providing training, mentoring and support to their less
experienced counterparts. This relationship is highly valued by the emerging regions, and it
seems to be working well. Fourth, skills have been developed through short and long-term
training, on-the-job training and local and external knowledge sharing events. The project
improved the capacity of the Civil Service to provide higher level training in critical areas such
as urban, tax and customs. The Civil Service University has trained over 2,000 urban managers
at Masters degree level to address urgent knowledge gaps in the management of Ethiopian cities
and around 500 in tax and customs.. Sixth, the legal and policy framework has significantly been
strengthened in areas such as finance, tax, civil service, decentralization, justice, and Information
and Communication Technology. Seventh, the business process review is implemented in over
20,000 offices across the country to streamline work processes and bring customer orientation in
the public service. The use of IT assisted by several sectors also brought significant
improvement in service delivery, information exchange between government and with the public.
These have streamlined functions and structures in government and significantly reduced
overlaps. For details, see Section 3.2.

(c)    Other unintended outcomes and impacts (positive or negative)
90.    Progress made in ICT facilities has been instrumental in farmers getting up-to-date
information on prices of commodities. Courts in Oromia have started sending automatic
reminders on court hearing dates to plaintiffs and defendants, thereby increasing the efficiency of
the court.

                                                23
91.     As a fall out of the PSCAP’s empowerment efforts, there is an increasing involvement of
citizens in small infrastructure and other developmental projects. For example, in Addis Ababa,
about 800 Community Development Committees have been established and are managing small
scale road access, drainage, sewerage and school maintenance activities in collaboration with the
local government.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

       Rating: Moderate

93.    The ICR team considers that the risk to development outcome is Moderate, based on the
following factors:

       •   The government has clearly expressed its willingness and commitment to continue
           working on public sector capacity building and governance issues with its own
           resources and grants. There is significant demand, especially from the regions where
           80% of resources were spent, for sustaining and expanding these services. Therefore,
           there will be a tremendous pressure on the government to come up with adequate
           resources to meet this demand after the closure of the project. The issue is whether
           the government will be able to meet the demand without additional support from
           development partners. In the team’s assessment, there is sufficient goodwill to sustain
           the achievement of the project and its development objectives.

           In the Treasury budget for fiscal year 2012/13, the government has provided (US$ 5.7
           million equivalent) to regions, and provision of fiscal year 2013/14 Treasury funding
           for PSCAP is under preparation. The annual average disbursement of IDA was
           US$16 million during the project years. Thus, there is a financing gap that needs to
           be filled and likely to be partially met with bilateral donor funds. (for details, see
           Section 2.5).

       •   The ability of the public sector to motivate and retain well qualified professionals is
           weak, with the resultant staff turnover. The government has introduced a number of
           human resource management (HRM) rules and regulations recently, but it is too early
           to gauge their impact on staff retention. The study on staff turnover currently being
           undertaken by the World Bank, at the request of the Government, will provide
           information and options to the Government in dealing with the problem.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry. Rating: Satisfactory

94.     QER was carried out by a panel of reviewers for the project. The panel rated the quality
of design, participation and partnerships and development impact as Highly Satisfactory, and
implementation and Bank inputs and processes as Satisfactory. The panel noted that the PSCAP
was notable for several strong features. For example: (i) On Ownership, the program for capacity
building was launched many months before the World Bank became involved. (ii) On
leadership: The government created a so-called Super-Ministry of Capacity Building and
appointed a major leader of the ruling party as its head to drive home the CB program. (iii) On
design, while there were arguably too many components (14), and too many sectors in the Bank-
supported program (6). The focus on the decentralized units of government put the emphasis
where it was needed most. (iv).On, collaboration: The PSCAP involved collaborative funding
and support among several bilateral and multilateral donors, all working to a common
program. (v) Flexibility: PSCAP allowed for different approaches in different circumstances,
with only a few predetermined aspects such as principles governing inter-government resource
transfers.

95.     According to the assessment of the ICR team, the Bank's performance in the
identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project was satisfactory. During preparation and
appraisal, the Bank took into account the adequacy of project design and all major relevant
aspects, such as technical, financial, economic, and institutional, including procurement and
financial management. Major risk factors and lessons learned from other earlier projects in the
public sector were considered and incorporated into the project design. The project was also
prepared in a highly participatory manner.

96.      Project preparation was carried out with an adequate number of specialists who provided
the technical skill mix necessary to address sector concerns and a good project design. The Bank
provided adequate resources in terms of staff weeks and dollar amount to ensure quality
preparation and appraisal work. The project was consistent with the CAS and government
priorities in the sector at the time. The Bank had a consistently good working relationship with
the Borrower during preparation and appraisal.

Quality of supervision: Rating: Satisfactory

97.    Bank's performance during the implementation of the project was satisfactory for the
following reasons:

98.    Monitoring and problem identification: The project was adequately supervised and
closely monitored through regular administrative procedures such as implementation support
missions and several independent reviews and studies. Throughout the project’s life, financial
management (FM) supervision missions and post-procurement reviews were undertaken to
ensure that the recommended measures were implemented and the FM arrangements remained
acceptable to the Bank. The task team regularly prepared Aides-Memoire, alerted the

                                               25
Government of Ethiopia and implementing agencies about issues found during project execution,
and facilitated prompt corrective action. The Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) realistically
rated the performance of the project both in terms of achievement of development objectives and
project implementation. Initially, there were delays in the Bank issuing No Objection Certificate
(NOC) for procurement because of lower threshold limit and shortage of procurement specialists
in the Bank’s country office. However, with the raising of the threshold limit and with the
recruitment of more procurement specialists, this issue was resolved. The Bank’s procurement
and financial management staff worked with implementing agencies’ staff to explain the rules
and procedures to be applied during project implementation, with regard to procurement of
goods and works, and selection of consultants, accountants and auditors. The team also used the
MTR to address significantly the key challenges around planning, M&E as well as procurement
management. In addition, the task team was proactive in conducting supply and demand side
survey to stay relevant to the issues that are important to the citizens and local governments. The
team, however, missed the opportunity to streamline the indicators on incentives during the
additional financing.

99.     Generating knowledge for learning and informing implementation: A number of
independent assessments and in-depth reviews on the overall program and specific elements of
the reform were conducted to bring experiences from other countries to strengthen the program.
These included: Independent Assessment of PSCAP (2007); Analysis of PSCAP(2009);
Assessment of Training under PSCAP (2009), which changed the shift from mass orientation to
a more focused skills development; Assessment of Gender under PSCAP (2009), which helped
in identifying and enforcing gender-related minimum mandatory activities; Assessment of ICT
(2009), which shifted the purchase of equipment to be based on the business process review
recommendations; Assessment of Justice Program (2009), which ensured that sufficient attention
was given to all justice organs rather than focusing only on the judiciary; Assessment of PSCAP
Impact on Developing Regions (2009), which directed special attention to these regions;
Assessment of M&E (2009), which made the focus on results and documenting the success
stories; Assessment of the Good Governance Package (2012); and Social Appraisal of PSCAP,
which confirmed that the activities under the package are actually making changes in
participation, access to information, accountability at lower government and need to be
monitored closely for it to make continuous improvement and for the donors to understand the
political economy of the public sector in Ethiopia. The team has also supported the establishment
of training on procurement of goods and consultants with the Ethiopia Management Institute
using the PSCAP Facility to ensure ownership and sustainability of training.

100. Fostering ownership: The team helped in establishing “PSCAP Managers’ Network? to
stimulate dialogue and decision making by creating a forum for mutual responsibility and
accountability among important actors, including the political and technical staff involved in the
program as well as donors. Similarly, in promoting mutual ownership of the program by all
cooperating donors, the team with the support of PSCAP-supporting donors established PSCAP
support facility to coordinate donors’ technical assistance and funding inputs and provide quality
implementation support around public sector issues. Both these initiatives have been identified as
good practices in the country management unit. The team was inclusive in the way they did their
business. The relationship between the Government of Ethiopia, the Bank and donors was
managed as per the signed MOU among themselves.


                                                26
101. Strengthening results orientation: The task team focused on the project’s development
impact. Despite the large number of indicators, the team was able to collect the necessary data to
measure achievement of results. The team continuously supported the government to make use
of result oriented participation and performance agreements that link the activities to the outputs
and outcomes. They also provided a number of training events, including the “demystifying the
results agenda? training to continuously focus on the results. The continuous use of the Woreda
and City Benchmarking Survey by the team to monitor impact of the program has been critical in
identifying gaps and possible solutions. The application of the findings of the survey has now
expanded to other large donor-financed government programs such as Protection of Basic
Services (PBS) and Urban Local Government Development Program (ULGDP)

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

102. With a Satisfactory rating for quality at entry and a Satisfactory rating for quality of
supervision, overall Bank performance is rated as Satisfactory in accordance with IEG’s
harmonized rating criteria

5.2    Borrower Performance

Government performance

Rating: Satisfactory

103. Preparation: As discussed in Section 2.1, at project preparation the government had
demonstrated its commitment to the project. The government performance during preparation is
thus rated Satisfactory.

104. Implementation: The government consistently maintained its commitment throughout the
implementation. In particular, the Government of Ethiopia was committed to ensuring
sustainability of the capacity development activities because they comprised a primary means of
ensuring continued social and economic development. The government officials worked closely
with the Bank's project team on a continual basis, and cooperated fully with the task team.

105. Even though the government had disbursed only US$68.4 million to the program, which
was 50% less than the pledged amount of US$137 million, this had no significant impact on the
achievement of the project objectives and outcomes as other sources of funding and the
additional World Bank financing compensated for this. However, as mentioned in Section 2.5,
the government is committed to supporting the program after the Bank’s support stopped in
December 2012 and has allocated resources in the budget to support the project, in addition to
appointing a top level official (Deputy Prime Minister to coordinate reforms.

106. The project was complex because it integrated multiple sectors, multiple levels of
government and multiple donors. Given its complexity, the responsibility of coordinating all
these actors and managing procurement, financial management and M&E was daunting and as a



                                                27
result had an understandably slow start in the initial years but picked up speed, particularly after
the mid-term.

107.   The government performance during implementation is thus rated Satisfactory.

Implementing agency or agencies’ performance

Rating: Satisfactory

108. The Ministry of Finance and MoCS had two hats- as coordinators and as implementers of
the sub-program/s housed in their respective ministries. The Ministry of Finance and Economic
Development (MoFED), as an overall coordinator of financial administration of the project,
struggled in submitting the IFRs in the initial years. Subsequently, it improved significantly and
submitted reports on time. The ministry was also implementer of the Expenditure Management
and Control sub-program, a role it performed well. It has exceeded the agreed actions, something
which has contributed to Ethiopia having shown improvement in 50% of PEFA indicators.
Overall, the public financial management aspect of the project made significant progress and
achieved its outcomes by the implementing agencies.

109. The MCB did not have any staffing issues and as a ‘Super Ministry’ it coordinated all
project activities with other ministries. Following the restructuring of MCB into the MoCS,
performance fluctuated, and it also had capacity constraints and high staff turnover. It was
responsible for conducting several project activities, including BPR, developing prototypes of
different reforms, project coordination, and DLDP. Reform of human resources management and
control, including incentive mechanisms did not go as originally planned.

110. The Ministry of Information and Communication Technology maintained very close
relationships with state level counterparts, and a good M&E system. It planned its activities
jointly with regional counterparts, and was consistent in its performance and prompt in planning
and reporting.

111. The Ministry of Urban Development and Construction supported cities by conducting
courses for staff at Bachelor’s and Master’s degree level and, as a result, its graduates are
managing cities in various capacities. It was also successful in strengthening the legal
frameworks for cities, implementing city planning system and cadaster system.

112. The role expected of the Ministry of Justice was unusually complex because its activities
covered a wide range of beneficiaries, including police, prisons, prosecution, and democratic
institutions. Even though the responsibility for coordination of the justice program was moved a
few times, the Ministry was successful in implementing activities such as introducing
community policing, forensic laboratory, upgrading the legal education through revisions to the
curriculum, and introduction of exit exams and apprenticeship before joining the workforce.

113. The Federal Supreme Court (FSC) implemented court reforms very well in the first 5-6
years of the project, but could not maintain the same tempo later on. The FSC implemented
many innovative activities in improving access to justice and making justice information
available to its users.

                                                28
114.   The ERCA was very focused and organized in implementing its activities.

115. Regions: Regarding regions, their capacity was very low at the beginning but they
improved over the years, and their overall performance was satisfactory.

116. Financial management: Based on the overall supervision missions conducted during the
life of the project, the overall financial management rating of the project was maintained at
Moderately Satisfactory. At the close of the project, the overall project risk was rated to be
Moderate.

117. On many occasions, the project did not use the budget adequately as a management tool
to help with decision making. The internal control system of the project was Moderately
Satisfactory. Most of those control procedures prescribed in the government system were
applied for the project. The project’s external audits from time to time reported weaknesses in
the internal control system, and annually the project had worked towards fixing these weaknesses.
Areas of weaknesses were mostly systemic, with the exception of weak monitoring of advances,
non-existence of internal audit, and poor coordination between implementing agencies.

118. Procurement: The procurement system under the PSCAP project was implemented in
about 20 implementing agencies. Implementation of the procurement aspect of both the original
project as well as the additional financing shared the overall problems, which were encountered
in the procurement system of the country. Some of the major problems which were encountered
included lack of procurement personnel at all levels, low level of salary structure, and the
consequent high level of staff turnover, as well as lack of familiarity with the Bank’s
procurement rules and procedures.

119. At the initial stage of the project, the procurement aspect of the project was characterized
by a considerable delay in the procurement processing of particularly the ICB contracts.
Particularly, the centralization of the procurement of bulk items and equipment in the focal
organization was considered a major impediment to the successful implementation of the project.
Following the MTR, several measures were taken to improve the procurement performance of
the project. The procurement process was decentralized and all implementing agencies,
particularly the regional project implementing agencies, were entrusted with the responsibility of
handling the procurement of ICB contracts.

Justification of rating for overall borrower performance

Rating: Satisfactory

120. With a Satisfactory rating for Government performance and a Satisfactory rating for
implementing agencies’ performance, overall borrower performance is rated as Satisfactory in
accordance with IEG’s harmonized rating criteria. The satisfactory outcome achieved by the
project was largely due to sustained government commitment and leadership and implementing
agencies’ performance in executing their part of the project activities.




                                               29
6.     Lessons Learned

121. There are a number of lessons that can be learned from PSCAP, both in the context of
managing public sector reform projects, and in terms of lessons for the Ethiopia portfolio.

122. Invest time and effort in alignment and securing political support: PSCAP has been
made up of a complex array of reforms across different sectors, fused together into a holistic and
integrated approach. It would have been difficult for the World Bank to maintain its engagement
without significant alignment of the project to the government’s own strategic plan, thus securing
high level political support, ownership and commitment from the Government of Ethiopia. Much
energy was invested at project design, and in the early days of the project, to understand the
government’s vision and thereby secure a high degree of alignment, and in continuing to secure
political commitment to the program. Public sector reform as a window into the state building
agenda: Much of the core activities supported by PSCAP, in particular the rolling out of the
decentralization agenda, are central to the government’s own vision of state building. Through its
involvement, the Bank has learnt much about the dynamics of power, politics and government’s
own vision for Ethiopia as a developmental state. This knowledge has been useful to the Bank in
terms of informing its other engagements across the portfolio, and also in terms of its overall
approach, which is now much better grounded in understanding of the context. There is a strong
case for continued engagement in the public sector reform agenda, even if that is in provision of
knowledge services as a partner to the government.

123. Engage more with support to sub-national governments where the bulk of service
delivery takes place: One of PSCAP’s major characteristics was the support given directly to
regions and their governments. Federal government is normally reluctant to allow direct donor-
regional government relations, and thus PSCAP has not been typical. Agreement for the Bank
and other donors to do business in this way was secured after a great deal of negotiation, but it
has paid dividends. Regions have, under the program, been able to adapt national reform policies
to meet their own priorities. Reform has been sequenced differently in different regions to reflect
context. The program has thus been able to support the decentralization process much more
effectively. At the same time, the Bank and other donors have been able to gain a better
appreciation of the individual dynamics of each region, and better focus their support. The
success of this approach has implications for the way in which the Bank and other donors might
manage their portfolio and design their operations in the future.

124. Innovative use of streamlining client satisfaction surveys in operations help to provide
feedback to influence behaviors in institutions: Streamlining the Woreda and City Benchmarking
Survey has been instrumental in helping to assess the effectiveness of reform, particularly at
decentralized level, as part of gauging the ‘demand’ side customer satisfaction. This has allowed
both the donor team and the government to identify gaps and shortfalls, and also areas where
there are success stories. A measure of the survey’s success is the increasing government
ownership of the process and use of its outputs, to the extent that the survey will almost certainly
outlive the project and be conducted by the government in the future.

125. The ‘learning by doing’ approach was a pragmatic approach to reforms: The project
had employed an approach to reform where activities had been sequenced, and where things
were tried out locally to see what worked best before being scaled up. Sequencing reforms so

                                                30
that the more institutionally advanced regions undergo certain activities in advance of other
regions has been successful, as have arrangements where the developing regions ‘twin’ with their
more developed neighbors (e.g. Afar and Tigray) so that mentoring support can be given
practitioner to practitioner. This approach has resulted in reforms being grounded in actual
practice rather than ‘one –size fits all’ approach.

126. Enforcing “minimum mandatory activities? in framework type projects: Given
Ethiopia’s uneven capacity among regions, the development and enforcement of prioritizing the
basic capacity building in HR, Finance, and working systems as “minimum mandatory activities?
enabled the regions to utilize the transfers responsibly and get the results across implementing
agencies regardless of initial capacity.

127. Context matters - customizing reform according to context: This has been particularly
relevant in the four developing regions, where capacity constraints have meant that reform needs
to be approached in a different way from the more developed regions.

128. Realism of Supervision Budgets: The Bank’s supervision budgets for this large and
complex project were not sufficient. The team had to look for other donors support in the first
two years to ensure quality implementation support is provided to the client. The quality of the
support provided to the client is significantly enhanced following the establishment of the trust
funds. Thus use of complementary financial instruments was a useful lesson.

129. Have a simple and implementable strategy for Information, Education and
Communication: The appraisal concluded that a strong campaign of IEC is essential to the
satisfactory implementation of public sector reforms. To this end, an IEC strategy was
developed at the beginning and consultant was hired to simplify the document during
implementation. Although IEC activities were implemented, they were not implemented
systematically to maximize awareness and support from all stakeholders.

130. Complex design, multiple sectors and implementing agencies as well as multiple
donors make implementation support and monitoring very challenging. While this approach
have worked well in Ethiopia, it is not certain it will work elsewhere, especially without strong
political leadership. It also means overstretching supervision teams and complexity of
assessment of achievements. 16 PDOs indicators and over 27 intermediate outcome indicators is
rather too complex to manage, despite the success in the case of Ethiopia.

Annex 2: PSCAP overall outputs and sub-programs

Output 1—Strengthened Legal and Policy Framework

   Civil service reform Program (CSRP)
   • The revised civil service proclamation was enacted and adopted by all regions.

   •   A number of human resource management (HRM) rules and regulations (recruitment and
       selection, transfer, promotion, etc) were made operational.

   •   A gender-responsive recruitment mechanism is one of the features included in the revised
       civil servants proclamation and provides for affirmative action towards females to join
       the civil service.

   •   The business process reengineering (BPR) guideline was approved by the Council of
       Ministers and has become operational at all levels of government to streamline work
       processes. It has, specifically: i) clarified the strategic vision, mission, mandates and
       products of public organizations; ii) allowed redesigning of work process by removing
       non value-adding steps; iii) developed service standards and reduced required

        audit backlog except in Gambella, which has four (4) year backlog compared to over
        eight (8) years.

   •    In addition, the EMCP supported the development of a program budgeting manual, stock
        management manual, revision of accounts manual based on the new public finance
        management, fixed asset manual and training modules, as well as establishment of
        standards for fixed assets and supplies standards. Furthermore, the sub-program
        concluded the assessment of harmonized and integrated pool system of state and
        municipal financial administration functions, integrating the property management and
        budget module with information management system, connecting finance bureaus and
        Woreda net for reporting; translating budget manuals; and institutionalizing training for
        procurement professionals.

Output 4—Improved Personnel Management Systems in Practice

       Civil Service Reform Program (CSRP)
   •    A new system of job evaluation and grading (JEG) has been developed and is being
        tested on a representative sample of jobs.

   •    The performance management system, known as the Balanced Score Card (BSC), is now
        being implemented in 145 federal and over 270 regional offices, and for the first time in
        the history of the civil service in Ethiopia, the institutions have integrated balanced
        scorecard measures in their strategic plans. A system of individual performance
        agreements linked to team and organizational performance targets derived from the
        balanced scorecard methodology is also being implemented in the above mentioned
        organizations. The performance appraisal manual developed in April 2012 has been pilot-
        tested in some offices for the last quarter of fiscal year 2011/12.

   •    Several regions attempted to develop the IT-based personnel management system,
        including Addis Ababa, SNNPR, Amhara, Somali, Tigray, Benshanagul and Afar.
        Moreover, the nation-wide integrated civil service management information system that
        is expected to streamline all systems is under development. The user requirement is
        finalized and the software customization will be finalized before June 2013, with support
        provided by other cooperating partners.

   •    A significant part of PSCAP funding went to skill enhancing activities. Skills were
        strengthened through on-the-job training, study tours, and short and long term distance
        training at Diploma, BA, MA and PhD level. Some examples include 2 PhD graduates,
        2,621 urban management graduates at Masters’ level, over 565at MA and BA in taxation
        and customs, as well as over 10,600 graduates of MA, BA and diploma level in a range of

                                               44
        subjects, including leadership, accounting, public administration, law, etc. The long term
        training has significantly increased the number of qualified civil servants at sub-national
        level. A huge number of short term training courses have also been delivered by each
        sub-program on new laws, directives, working systems, and reforms as well as to citizens
        on good governance under DLDP, tax payer education under TSRP, etc. The CSRP
        delivered training to over 736,207; the DLDP to over 7,743,404 staff and citizens; the
        JSRP to over 159,297; the UMCBP to over 216,246; the ICT to over 140,456; the TSRP
        to over 307,082 (excluding tax payer education using different media) and the EMCP to
        over 45,505.

Output 5—Intergovernmental Fiscal and Revenue Mobilization Mechanisms in Place

       District Level Decentralization Program (DLDP)

   •    The model fiscal transfer formula for both sedentary and pastoral-based regions was
        developed by the Ministry of Capacity Building. All regions, except Harari, have
        developed a fiscal transfer formula, compared to only four regions in 2005. Predictable
        and transparent formula-based fiscal transfers have been developed for regions and
        Woredas.

   •    Specific purpose grants for capital investments were introduced from the federal level to
        51 pilot Woredas in the four (4) relatively-advanced regions and Benishangul–Gumuz
        through BPS, and cities through ULGDP.

       Urban Management Capacity Building Program (UMCBP)
   •    Five-year municipal capital investment plans were prepared with the participation of
        stakeholders. In addition, 19 reforming cities produced a three-year investment plan.

   •    Revenue enhancement plan was prepared in Tigray, Dire Dawa and Somali.

   •    Fiscal transfer framework for urban local government was developed in Dire Dawa and
        Gambella.

       Tax System Reform Program (TSRP)
   •    Different manuals were developed and made operational at federal and regional level,
        including tax accounting and auditing manual, tariff manual, customs transit and
        clearance manual, anti-smuggling strategy and manual, risk management procedure,
        receipt keeping and utilization manual, tariff manual, complaint handling manual, post-
        clearance audit manual, cash register manual, translation of VAT audit and collection
        manual, and forms to local languages, etc.

Output 6–Vertical Accountability Mechanisms Established

    Civil Service Reform Program (CSRP)
   • All offices have established service standards as a result of the BPR initiative. These
     were developed in consultation with clients. Standards are publicized through the media,
     pamphlets, notice boards (where the service is provided). Efforts are now exerted to
     formalize these standards through the Citizens Charter. The Ministry of Civil Service
     pioneered the first ever Citizen Charter in 2012. This was followed by consultation and
     training workshops with sectors and regions to roll out the system at all levels. Fourteen
     (14) federal ministries have developed Citizen’s Charters and publicizing them has been
     initiated. Amhara region has developed charters for all regional bureaus. Three other big
     regions have developed charters for their Civil Service Bureaus as a model, based on the
     charter developed by the Federal Ministry of Civil Service.

Output 7–Horizontal Accountability Mechanisms (or Checks and Balances) Established

    District Level Decentralization Program (DLDP)
   • Devolution of basic services to the district/Woreda level scaled up to all nine (9) regions
     and two (2) city administrations compared to four (4) regions in 2005.

   •    All regions have adopted the framework for grassroots participation.

   •    All regions implementing the good governance package have strengthened participation
        by establishing the following key institutional focal points for participation: i) Kebele
        Managers: These are lower level professionals hired to coordinate and mobilize resources
        for effective service delivery. They provide a one-stop shop service to citizens, address
        requests and complaints, present issues and complaints beyond their capacity to the
        Kebele Council or administration for decision, compiles and makes available Kebele
        data, consolidates Kebele plan in collaboration with plan experts, and mobilizes people
        and resources as needed; ii) Kebele Supervision and Inspection Team: The team reports
        to the Kebele Council and has nine (9) members consisting two (2) members from youth,
        two (2) members from women associations, and the other five (5) from voting and non-
        voting Kebele Council members. The team is responsible for reviewing and reporting
        whether plans are prepared in a participatory manner and activities are implemented
        according to plan using the right procedures and in a fair and transparent manner.

       Justice System Reform Program (JSRP)
   •    The recent study on independence, transparency and accountability in the Ethiopian
        judiciary reports that the independence of courts is adequately recognized and protected
        in the Ethiopian Constitution and the various laws concerning the judiciary. Significant
        efforts are exerted through short and long-term training to address gaps in understanding
        and respect for the principles of judicial independence, both by all judges and by
        executives. Judicial Administration Commission (JAC) is now independently organized
        and the board has been made to include lawyers, legal educationists, and prominent
        citizen figures to make it more transparent. Judge nomination has become fully merit-
        based. In addition, the justice system reform focused on reforming legal education to

                                               46
     produce qualified legal professionals. Assessment was made on the entire curriculum and
     16 out of 67 courses were found to be below standard. These curriculums have been
     revised and upgraded. Manuals to administer the mandatory exit exams and
     apprenticeship were developed, and are being enforced for all legal students.

•    A study has been conducted on recurrent petitions to prevent maladministration and
     citizen right violation.

•    Guidelines for legal teaching material and textbook have been prepared.

•    Clinical legal education manual and code of conduct governing students engaged in
     clinical program and externship program have been developed.

•    Other regulatory frameworks and guidelines have been developed, such as distance legal
     education in Ethiopia directive, continuous professional legal development directive, and
     short term legal training in Ethiopia directive.

•    Research has been conducted on the traditional legal system of Tigray (Wajirat), Afar and
     SNNPR (Konso) regions.

•    Public perception survey on justice system has been conducted.

•    Each region has established an Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission, except Somali
     region. At federal level, 18 ministries are undertaking risk assessments to reduce the
     opportunities for corruption (rent seeking).

•    All civil service institutions at federal and regional levels are audited annually by the
     auditor-general, and the reports are presented to their respective parliaments. Annual
     physical performance reports are also submitted to the respective parliaments (semi-
     annually in the case of federal MABs). Standing committees function at regional and
     Woreda level in all regions.

    Urban Management Capacity Building Program (UMCBP)

•    The framework for urban public participation was developed by the Ministry of Urban
     Development and Construction.

    Information Communication Technology (ICT)

•    ICT is increasingly being used to enhance citizen’s access to government information and
     services. Call centers are established for 21 offices in Addis Ababa, Oromia and SNNPR,
     which make use of toll free numbers (888-Addis Ababa and Oromia and 942 for
     SNNPR). Averages of 1,000 calls are received daily on the system. Similarly, the
     national government portal is providing information to internal and external users and is
     being visited by over 7,000 users monthly. Overall, 162 websites were developed at
     regional offices to serve a similar purpose.

Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

Additional Examples of the Project’s Efficiency

Almost all the sub-programs have advanced beyond what was anticipated under the five (5)- year
      action plan.
•     In decentralization, the good governance package attempted to streamline all principles of
      good governance (accountability, transparency, efficiency, effectiveness, rule of law,
      participation and consensus building, etc) rather than addressing only participation of
      citizens. It also helped to institutionalize the Kebeles (village) level administration in
      service delivery and decision making process. In doing this, decentralization has helped
      to provide services to the population in an efficient way.
•     The urban component managed to more than double the target of Masters’ level urban
      graduates from a planned target of 1,000 to 2,621, of which 2,102 (80.2%) came from
      regions.
•     Expenditure management and control introduced program budgeting, fixed asset
      management systems, etc in addition to rolling out the reforms initiated earlier. In
      addition, the improvements in planning, budgeting, execution and reporting will have
      trickle-down effects in other programs.
•     The biometric taxpayer information registration system that is implemented across the
      nation registered over 2 million taxpayers’ information from a baseline of zero (0) in the
      last three years.
•     Justice supported new initiatives such as asset registration and disclosure, and reforms in
      legal education.
•     The promulgation and implementation of land lease system is the major activity of cities,
      which has brought efficiency in land delivery system.

Annex 5: Beneficiary Survey Results

Woreda and City Administrations Benchmarking Survey IV: Citizens’ Report Card
(CRC) Survey of Service Delivery Satisfaction Status

The Public Sector Capacity Building Program Support Project finances six (6) core sub-
programs that are directly linked to the outcomes. One or more sub-programs may contribute for
each of the outcomes. One of the binding agreements in the project is to initiate Woreda/district
and city level benchmarking as one of the main monitoring tools. The Woreda and City
Benchmarking Survey helped in creating the baselines data and to measure progress over the
years. The first survey was conducted in 2005/06 in a limited number of local governments and
covered the supply side survey only. Starting the second survey conducted in 2008, it
incorporated the demand-side survey.

The supply-side survey collects and analyzes the data from officials in local jurisdictions on
aspects such as financial autonomy, institutional capacity and coordination, service delivery,
practice of participation, and openness of the local government affairs to citizens. The demand
side survey, on the other hand, collects and analyzes the views, opinions and perceptions of
citizens with regard to service delivery, openness of the local governments, including access to
government information, participation and accountability. The demand side survey uses three
tools (Citizens’ Report Card using household survey), Focus Group Discussion with citizens
representatives, and Key Informant Interviews with civil society organizations).

The first round of the Woreda and City Benchmarking Survey was carried out in 2005/06 and
established a baseline in a limited number of jurisdictions - 78 jurisdictions (10% of the total
districts and city governments). In the subsequent three rounds, the sample size increased to 291
jurisdictions (38%), 384 jurisdictions (50%), and 256 jurisdictions (33%), respectively, including
the initial (10%) jurisdictions used for time series comparison.

The Citizens’ Report Card component, which is using household survey, aims to collect and
analyze the views, opinions and perceptions of citizens with regard to governance and service
delivery at the local administration level. In every round of the survey, it covers about 11,000
households. The survey result indicates a confidence interval of +/- 3 percentage points at 95%
confidence interval. According to the survey results, the proportion of households satisfied with
overall health services has increased from 62% to 70% between 2008 and 2011 (WCBSII and
WCBSIV). While primary education satisfaction has risen from 84% to 91%, the agriculture
extension service satisfaction has also increased from 90% to 94% for the same period.

In relation to transparency and access to government information, citizens who know what taxes
and fees they are legally required to pay increased from 60% in 2008 to 81% in 2011. Those who
know about their Woreda budget and strategic plan increased from 13% and 17% in 2008 to 20%
and 19% in 2011, respectively. Citizens who know council meetings are open to the public
increased from 11% in 2008 to 32% in 2011, while those who are personally consulted on
development issues increased from 17% to 20% over the same period. In the recent Woreda and
City Benchmarking Citizens Report Card, 49% of the respondents think an ordinary person can
do something to hold local government leaders to account if they fail to keep their promises.
Similarly, the loss of confidence that concerns raised regarding local government’s service

quality will be addressed also seems to recover slightly after considerable loss between 2008 and
2010. Confidence that concerns raised in relation to quality of service in health increased from
56% to 58% and in water from 8% to 14%.

Annex 6: Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

I. Report on the First Workshop of the PSCAP Project Managers’ Network (PPMN) 12
   April 2011: Desalegn Hotel, Addis Ababa

Introduction

The Ministry of Civil Service in collaboration with the World Bank and the PSCAP Facility
hosted the 1st PSCAP Project Managers Network Workshop on 12 April 2011. It was attended by
Heads of Capacity Building/Civil Service Bureaus and Planning and Programming Officers of
the nine (9) Regional States and two (2) City Administration; State Ministers, Directors and
Program Coordinators of the Federal implementing agencies and the relevant Directors at the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. The main objectives of the Workshop were to:
i) establish the PSCAP Project Managers Network; ii) review the progress of PSCAP in the first
six (6) months of the current fiscal year; iii) agree on the way forward on earlier agreed actions;
and iv) identify areas of further clarification and direction.

PSCAP Managers Network: Terms of Reference

Participants appreciated the effort made by Ministry of Civil Service (MoCS) and the World
Bank to establish a network that will provide a national forum to closely follow up PSCAP
implementation. The draft Terms of Reference was discussed and several comments on the
membership, functions and modalities were provided. Some of the major comments included
expanding the membership to Heads of Bureaus of Finance and Economic Development, who
are administering PSCAP’s finances and PPD Heads in regions who are following up the day to
day activities of PSCAP; convening the meeting quarterly with a provision to call emergency
meetings as needed; and to include both physical and financial aspects of PSCAP in the review.
It was recommended that a document be produced to incorporate the network in the current
institutional arrangements to avoid duplication and the document be disseminated to all the
participants along with the revised Terms of Reference. The issue of strengthening the
steering committee at the regional level will also need to be taken up by the Bureaus of
Capacity Building/Civil Service in line with the comprehensive institutional framework to be
developed. The next meeting of the PPMN was also tentatively planned to be held on 12 July
2011.

PSCAP Six Months Report (June-December 2010)

Performance of Implementing Agencies: The report covers the period between June and
December 2010 and reports the activities that are completed 100%. The report shows that all
regions received the Treasury component of PSCAP in July 2010. At federal level, good progress
was documented in ICT, EMCP in strengthening the legal and policy framework as well as
systems development, followed by Justice, Supreme Court, and Urban. The activities under Tax
system reform are mostly completed and the few suggested require more time to complete
because of their nature. On the other hand, progress was not made in CSRP and DLDP during
the report period.


                                                53
At regional level, a relatively slower pace was witnessed in the last six (6) months. Dire Dawa
from the relatively advanced regions and Somali from the developing regions were able to
progress their activities better. Amhara, Tigray, Oromia, Harari, Somali, and SNNPR made
progress on selected activities. On the other hand, it was not clear from the report how much was
done in Gambella and Addis Ababa. In addition, no report was received from Afar and
Benshangul.

Performance of thematic areas and categories of expenditures: Overall, activities that contribute
towards improving performance of service delivery and those that enhance transparency of the
public sector progressed relatively well than those that relate to strengthening the participation of
citizens and civil society organizations in the development process. The financial regulation and
directives, manuals for procurement, budget, property management and stock management were
revised. Integrating the budget manual and property management into the information system
was also completed by the EMCP sub-program. Similarly, the ICT sub-program developed the e-
government strategy, e-government architecture framework, and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
framework and guideline.

These were complemented with skill-developing training activities that added value in improving
performance of the public service delivery. The training from CSRP focused more on the
balanced score card; DLDP on good governance; EMCP and Court Reform on developed or
revised regulations, manuals and systems; JSRP on roles and responsibilities of the three
branches of government, ethics, alternative dispute resolution; ICT on basic and advanced ICT;
Tax on taxpayers education; Urban on Masters degree in urban management, and short-term
training on urban systems such as base map development.

Similarly, the Federal Supreme Court and ICT sub-program developed several systems that
enhance access to government information, thus contributing to increasing transparency of the
public sector. The establishment of the call center for six (6) federal institutions and the
development of the portal for six (6) federal institutions are worth mentioning. On average,
35,000 people made use of the call center to resolve their issues and 2,500 people visited the
portal to get information. Similarly, the Court reform also updated its website and interactive
voice response system, which allowed users to get case-related information by calling a hotline
number.

Format of the physical progress report: Most of the implementing agencies used the appropriate
Participation and Performance Agreement (PPA) format to track their progress. However,
Oromia and Gambella did not provide sufficient detail on the PPA, and Amhara, A.A, and
Somali did not use the full PPA format to report. In almost all reports, the level of detail
provided in the narrative is either not sufficient or too elaborated. The report from the Federal
ICT seemed to balance the two by producing short but clear report. This was promised to be
disseminated to all for reference. Finally, as one of the minimum mandatory activities, the report
on training should have included gender disaggregated number of participants, but none of the
reports incorporated this aspect and was recommended to be included in the annual report at the
end of the fiscal year.




                                                 54
Financial report: The Interim Financial Report (IFR) was submitted a little late but has
improved a lot compared to the previous years. Audit for year that ended on July 2010 was
received on time.

Key recommendations: All agencies should submit their reports on time, incorporating a
summary narrative on results, tracking developments on the agreed PPA, and providing
gender disaggregated information on the training provided.

Coordination between Federal and Regional Sub-program Directors

The ICT sub-program has been identified as the best practice in terms of the coordination
between the federal and regional counterparts. Ato Abiy Tessemma, Coordinator of PSCAP at
the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology, made a presentation on the sub-
programs experience. Determinants of the success include the leadership’s commitment, and
determined dates for reporting and meeting. The regions are benefiting from these meetings by
learning from others and getting answers for their questions. The participants appreciated the
need for close working relationship between federal and regional sub-program directors to ensure
the plan reflects the country’s overall direction in each sector. It was agreed that all the sub-
program Directors meet with their regional counterparts in the next couple of months and
PSCAP’s plan for end of fiscal year 2004 be conducted together before a finalized document is
produced by regions. This should be followed by six (6) monthly meetings to review progress.
The MCS will organize a meeting with Ato Abiy for federal agencies that need further
guidance, and a copy of the presentation will be sent to all.

Strengthening the Four Developing Regions

The Ministry of Civil Service reported on the support provided to all regions in implementing the
reforms over the past six (6) years, but the result was mixed. Based on the Ministry’s assessment,
only the four (4) developing regions would require further support from the ministry.
Accordingly, the Ministry has finalized its plan of action to build the capacity of the leadership
and the professionals in these regions on four basic areas: i) human resources management
system; ii) financial management and audit; iii) planning, implementing, monitoring and
reporting on activities; and iv) leadership, change management, and team building. The plan has
already been sent to the four regions for their reactions. The support is already being initiated in
the Somali Regional State. About 75 professionals were trained on Training of Trainers (ToTs),
and this was done in collaboration with the Ethiopian Management Institute and Ethiopian Civil
Service College. Ethiopian Management Institute (EMI) and Ethiopian Civil Service Collage
(ECSC) will continue to support the trainers to conduct training to 3,000 professionals and
leaders in the coming months. The Afar Regional State representative reported receiving the plan
and expressed their agreement. They requested the Ministry to initiate the process late April
2011, as they are conducting the BPR in the region. Representative of the Benshangul-Gumuz
Regional State also reported receiving the plan and are happy to get the training, but noted that
their region is in much better situation than others. Gambella’s representative was not familiar
with the plan and was asked to convey the message to the leadership. The PPMN agreed with
the Ministry’s plan to support the four (4) regions in building the capacity in the four (4)



                                                55
indicated areas and also use the PSCAP facility to enhance their capacity in procurement,
financial management, and M&E.

Synergies between big Programs such as PSCAP, LIG, PBS, ULGDP, DIP

Protection of Basic Services (PBS), Local Investment Grant (LIG), and Urban Local
Government Development Program (ULGDP) are three large initiatives that provide recurrent
and capital investment to rural and urban local governments, while Democratic Institution
Program (DIP) supports the democratic institutions. It was noted that the success of these
programs is dependent on adequate capacity for planning, service delivery and expenditure
management, and accountability, which PSCAP is expected to deliver. Good results are already
achieved in ULGDP as a result of the graduates from the Masters in Urban Management
Program supported by PSCAP, and who are now working in the different cities to implement
ULGDP. Similarly, PSCAP funding was used to build the capacity in the Ministry of Finance
and Economic Development - MoFED/Bureau of Finance and Economic Development -
BoFEDin order to manage the big programs indicated above. In the current fiscal year, efforts
have been made to avoid duplications in EMCP and DIP-supported institutions. It was noted that
the Channel One Coordinating Unit was established in MoFED, and was able to produce and
apply uniform procedures on all large channel one programs. However, a lot can be done to
make aid more effective by synergizing them. The network agreed that a group from the
MoFED, MCS and the Bank to meet the Channel One Department at the Ministry of Finance
to identify further areas of synergy between these programs.

PSCAP Facility Work Plan

The Bank made a brief summary of the purpose of the PSCAP Facility and the eligible
expenditures, and reported the activities suggested by the contributing donors. This was followed
by a request to the participants on other activities that they think will improve the
implementation of PSCAP. The participants will send their suggestion by e-mail.

Participation under PSCAP

One of the pillars of the government’s homegrown “good governance package? is participation.
The good governance package was implemented in all the relatively advanced regions, and is
being initiated in the four developing regions. From the report provided by the regions, the
package seemed to focus at Woreda and particularly at Kebele level. In the advanced regions, 16
service delivery formats and 10 directives, including participation manual, were produced and
training was given to women, youth, teacher associations, development committees and
inspection teams. As a result, the Kebele structure was revised and the mechanisms for citizens
and civil society organization participation were expanded by increasing the number of Kebele
council members to 300 and establishment of four (4) development committees and a separate
inspection and supervision team that consists of both the citizens and members of the Kebele
Council. These development committees’ comment on plan, priority list, identification of sites,
time of execution, and modalities of implementation. The inspection and supervision teams also
review plans, monitor the implementation of the plans, and report to the Council (quarterly) and
the public (six monthly). Youth, women and others were encouraged to form associations. In

                                               56
addition, citizens are also participating directly in development activities with monetary and non-
monetary contributions, and a lot is being done by the citizens. One example is the establishment
of “Development Ketean? in Addis Ababa. These are development committees that have a chair,
secretary and auditor and are responsible for identifying problems, and prioritizing on what
needs to be done. They have already met the citizens’ needs in health, water, road, etc. Similar
examples were cited from all regions. Another area where the citizens are participating is in
community policing. On the other hand, the expenditure management and control sub-program
also described the financial transparency and accountability initiative supported by the Basic
Protection of Services. The initiative covers federal, regional and Woreda levels and four (4)
manuals were produced and supported with five (5) people at the federal level, one person at
regional, three (3) at zone and five (5) at Woreda level. Training was provided to these focal
persons and at least 50 people from each Woreda on participation of citizens in budget planning
and monitoring of budget. The initiative focuses on developing user friendly information to
laypersons on budget, using easily understood pictures. This discussion was complemented by a
presentation made by Mr. Per Wam, a Social Scientist on the general international experience in
the area of participation and accountability and some of the work done by PBS. The network
recommended that a consultant be hired to review what is happening on the ground, to track
results and areas of improvement, and integration between the work that is done in PSCAP
and PBS.

Major Points of Concern and Suggested Actions

Shortage of funds: The Head of the Treasury Department explained to the participants that
Statement of Expenditures have to be sent by implementing agencies to replenish the utilized
funds. He explained that the Treasury component of PSCAP fund was sent as an advance to all
the regions but the fund from the Bank was sent to only six (6) regions because the other five (5)
regions have not accounted for what they have already taken. All regions must submit the
Statement of Expenditure (SOE) as soon as possible to get the replenishment.

Delayed finalization of PPA and procurement plan: The main problem behind the delay in the
PPA finalization is the lack of focus in the draft PPA sent by regions. It was noted that the World
Bank has given its no objection to most activities and suggested to proceed with exception of
those few that require further revision. But still, the final procurement document was submitted
by Dire Dawa, Harari, Oromia, A.A, Tigray, and Amhara. All have received their no objection
except Amhara, which was planned to be revised with MCS but the suggested staff from MCS
has now left the Ministry. From the Federal Agencies, the Urban Development Capacity
Building Office (UDCBO) and Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTDA)
submitted. UDCBO received its no objection, while the procurement staff from ICTDA is
expected to finalize the document with the World Bank’s Procurement staff. SNNPR, Somali,
Benshangul, Gambella, and Afar from Regions and EMCP, JSRP, Court, CSRP, DLDP, Tax
need to submit their final procurement plan to the World Bank, and the Procurement
Specialist will provide support in finalizing it to those that require assistance.

Clarification on procurement procedures: Some of the participants requested clarification on the
procurement procedures particularly in relation to whether regions should use the government or
the Bank’s procurement procedures, and whether there is a predetermined preference on whether

                                                57
to use the regular budget or the PSCAP fund to buy goods because of VAT payment. The
network agreed that clarification on the suggested questions should be provided by MCS and
the World Bank as soon as possible.

M&E capacity: Implementing agencies reported that they have put in place procurement and
M&E staff. Strengthening the capacity of M&E and procurement in implementing agencies is a
continuous process. MCS informed the participants that four (4) days M&E training is under
preparation and will be conducted on 25-28 May 2011.

II. Report on the Second Workshop of the PSCAP Project Managers’ Network, 3 October,
2011, Kaleb Hotel, Addis Ababa

Introduction

The Ministry of Civil Service in Collaboration with the World Bank and the PSCAP Facility
hosted the 2nd PSCAP Project Managers Network Workshop on 3 October 2011. The meeting
was chaired by H. E. Ato Adamu Ayana, State Minister of PSCAP and co-chaired by Wzo Elsa
Araya, the task team leader of PSCAP. It was attended by Heads of Civil Service Bureaus,
Planning and Programming Officers of the nine (9) Regional States and two (2) City
Administration; State Ministers, Directors and Program Coordinators of the Federal
implementing agencies, the relevant Directors at the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Development and their Regional counterparts, as well as donors from DfID and the EU. The
main objectives of the workshop were to: i) review the progress of PSCAP in light of the agreed
actions in the last network meeting and the joint review mission; and ii) brainstorm on the future
operation of PSCAP.

Agenda 1: Status of Agreed Actions–Previous Network Meeting and the Joint Review
Mission

Leadership and Coordination

Steering Committee: The most impressive improvement was observed in the effort to revamp the
steering committees in all regional states and city administrations. All regions have reinstated the
steering committees that are chaired by the President or Deputy Presidents of the regions. The
2004 participation and performance agreements were reviewed and approved by these steering
committees, and the cover letters signed by the President or Deputy Presidents.

Coordination between Federal and Regions Program Directors: The coordination between
federal and regional sub-programs has also improved. Almost all programs have met with their
regional counterparts. The draft 2004 plan was discussed on a three day workshop in Debreziet,
and later the revised version from regions were commented on by all sub-programs, except urban.
Strengthen communication with PSCAP stakeholders: PSCAP Managers’ Network has continued
to serve as the medium for all partners to share information, agree on issues of common interest,
and dialogue on important policy issues. The second network meeting was conducted on 3
October 2011, though after some delay.



                                                58
Program Management

Coordinating office at the Ministry of Civil Service: The Ministry has still a lot of way to go to
make the PSCAP coordinating office fully effective. There is a PSCAP focal person and one out
of the two agreed M&E staff continued to work on PSCAP, although still not focusing on M&E.
One procurement staff was hired but the Finance Officer and the replacement for the Director are
not yet hired.

Program coordination and management in Gambella and Benshangul: The Ministry of Civil
Service reported that they will have a meeting with the representatives of these regions following
the network meeting. However, the agreed orientation to wider stakeholders in these regions has
not yet been conducted.

Streamlined and strengthened JSRP management: Four (4) monitoring and evaluation staff were
assigned to follow up on the activities of JSRP, but the full time Procurement Officer is not yet
hired.

Concerted support to Developing Regions: The Ministry of Civil Service continued its effort in
providing an intensive training of trainers in planning, government financial management, audit,
human resource management and team building to create the basic capacity. In addition, the
Ministry has allocated funds to hire professionals for each region to continue its support.
Disbursement and financial management: The Bank has replenished the government account two
times following MoFED’s two submissions in July and August. The Audit Report Action plan
was also prepared by MoFED, and details were discussed and agreement was reached to provide
response by 10 October 2011. Regular meetings between MoFED and MCS have not yet
materialized, although they communicate informally when need arises.
Strengthening monitoring and evaluation: A comprehensive M&E training was conducted in
collaboration with the World Bank from 29 May to 1 June 2011. Currently, there is one out of
two agreed M&E staff at the Ministry of Civil Service. All regions have submitted their annual
report and there is slight improvement in reporting results and providing gender disaggregated
data.

Program Activities

Review of participation of citizens and civil society: The consultants were hired and have
completed their field visits. The draft report is expected to be produced at the beginning of
November 2011.

Initiate studies in performance-oriented incentive system: The integration of individual
performance management was not included in the 2004 CSRP PPA. Therefore, comment was
sent to CSRP to get this activity included in this year’s Participation and Performance Agreement
(PPA).




                                               59
The development of application for e-services: The contract for the development was awarded.

Agenda No. 2: Brainstorming the future PSCAP

A kick-off presentation was made by the World Bank. The presentation included comparison
between Ethiopia’s public sector reform approach and other countries, the results documented so
far by PSCAP, and a few suggestions on the possible strategic issues the follow-up PSCAP
should deal with. Some of the suggestions touched on the need to develop effective institutions
in terms of using resources, attracting and retaining good professionals, using ICT, etc. In
addition, issues of corruption particularly in urban land administration, strengthening
accountability mechanisms, enhancing the rule of law and independency of the judiciary, as well
as enhancing citizen’s participation were mentioned. It was noted that previously used systems
were replaced with new ways of thinking, but these are at their infant stage, and continuous
support is needed to ensure institutionalization of the new systems. The meeting recommended
that the Ministry of Civil Service convene a meeting to initiate this discussion shortly.

Agreed Actions

1.   All implementing agencies will take the necessary measures on the current agreed actions,
     and those that were agreed before but were not fully achieved.
2.   The steering committee will convene meetings quarterly and the regional technical team on
     a monthly basis to ensure continuous involvement of the high level leadership and effective
     implementation of the program by the technical staff(ongoing).
3.   Regular monthly meetings will be convened between the Federal Ministry of Civil Service
     and Ministry of Finance and Economic Development to address implementation issues
     timely(ongoing).
4.   Responses on the actions taken in relation to the audit findings will be sent to
     MCS/MoFED by Monday, 10 October 2011. In addition, all implementing agencies need
     to make their utmost effort to clear advance payments timely.
5.   Federal and regional implementing agencies will confirm/notify the Ministry of Civil
     Service on: i)the Directors and focal persons working on PSCAP and whether the staff who
     had taken the M&E training are still in place and conducting M&E-related work(20
     October 2011).
6.   All federal and regional implementing agencies should focus on results in their reports and
     also provide gender disaggregated data where it applies(ongoing).
7.   The Ministry of Civil Service will convene a meeting shortly in relation to future PSCAP(4
     November 2011).
8.   MoFED, as an overall coordinator of programs, will initiate the discussion on synergies
     that could be maximized between PSCAP, PBS, ULGDP and DIP (14 November, 2011).

Annex 7: Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Overall, the report is good and it is appreciated since it tries to incorporate quantitative data,
which is difficult in such kind of projects. But we have some comments in general.

Considering PSCAP activities as an additional task is wrong perception by the implementers,
since their routine activities include support to reform. Since PSCAP is a reform activity, the
implementers should perceive it as additional responsibility. Therefore, the solution may be for
the respective implementing departments to incorporate PSCAP activities in the job description
of the relevant staff and include it in their performance evaluation. The other solution would be
to assign separate individuals the PSCAP activity as a coordinator at federal level.

There were capacity gaps among implementing bodies. Their implementation performance also
varied from region to region and program to program. Other challenges were timing problems in
planning, monitoring and evaluation of PSCAP activities.

We have to be cautious when we mention the regions that achieved some results. In that case,
there might be other regions (beyond the listed regions) that achieved some result but did not use
PSCAP resources. Therefore, the report should recognize this fact. For example, regional
constitution was amended by many regions other than those listed in this report (i.e. Amhara,
Gambella, Benishangul, Ormia, Somali). The regions mentioned used PSCAP funds to amend
their constitutions. But other regions might have amended without using PSCAP resources for
this purpose. It would be useful to make this distinction.

The issue of cross cutting areas was a challenge for the whole project implementation period.
PSCAP has three cross cutting issues: Gender, HIV and Environment. Specifically, HIV and
environment were not properly addressed. In fact, there is some effort but that is not enough and
was not as expected. The EAs had difficulties in mainstreaming these activities in their annual
plans. It may be because of the nature of the sector, but there must have been some solutions to
address this challenge since the problem was identified during the MTR period.

We agree the problem of staff turnover is general and needs attention. It affected the
performance of the project and institutional memory of the project.

Information, Education and Communication (IEC) was part of project activities, but it was not
properly implemented.

Annex 8: Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Written comments on the draft ICRR on PSCAP were received from the Department for
International Development, Italian Cooperation and European Union.  The comments broadly
confirmed the findings and appreciated the effort to substantiate the achievements with
quantitative data which is usually difficult in such kind of projects. The comments are
summarized below:




                                               61
General

Consolidating Core Government Functions: PSCAP was very helpful in consolidating core
government functions at all tiers of government. It is difficult to summarize all PSCAP
achievements in quantitative terms as qualitative aspect is as important as the quantitative results, if
not more. (DFID)

The long-term nature of reforms Vs project cycle.: It is important to note the long term nature of
reforms in the public administration and appreciate the mismatch between the accepted project
life cycle and the need for long-term engagement on the issue in a developing country like
Ethiopia. (Italy).

Design

The project was well designed and appropriate for public sector capacity building implemented
across the country. The two issues indicated in the document such as the performance-based
budgeting and indicators related to incentives could have been reengineered during the MTR.
(EU)

The design of PSCAP is comprehensive and probably the best in principle but the capacity to
manage it effectively has been an issue because of capacity. (DFID)

Implementation

“Super? Ministry of Capacity Building Vs. Ministry of Civil Service: The document can
differentiate the profile and level of focus the project had enjoyed before and after the
restructuring of the former Super Ministry to the current Ministry of Civil Service which seems
to have reduced scope and coverage. The restructuring compounded by turnover of skilled staff
resulted in disruption of implementation. (EU, Italy)

Information Education and Communication Strategy: The reforms, given the achievements,
were not complemented with an appropriate communication strategy that systematically keeps
everyone informed and prompts the good work. (EU, Italy)

Synergies with other large programs: PSCAP was the first program that was in place to address
public administration in the country. Although, there has been an effort to coordinate the
activities that were originally covered by PSCAP and later on picked up by other large programs
that came after it such as PBS, LIG, ULGDP, greater synergy could have been maximized (Italy).


Delay in donors’ funds: The delay in other donors’ funds was partly caused by the absence of
clarity on the part of the government on the future of the program when the new Ministry of
Civil Service was created. (EU)

MoFED’s Role: The dichotomy in the expected roles of the MoFED as fund manager/financial
manager as well as the beneficiary as part of one of the components of the program could have

                                                  62
contributed to delay in approval. MoFED performs well when it is both the owner and
administrator of any program. (EU)
Risk: The original risk assessment didn’t explicitly included high turnover of key staffs and top
officials the program encountered later.

Way Forward

Road Map: The Ministry of Civil Service has also developed a Roadmap for Civil Service
Reform for the next 5 to 10 years in collaboration with DFID. The document was accepted by the
government. (DFID)
