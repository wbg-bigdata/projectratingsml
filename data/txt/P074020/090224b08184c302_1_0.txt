                         Implementation Status Overview
                         IDA's support to the project is expected to be closed on December 31, 2012. Government will continue the program using funding from treasury and other development partners.

                         Relevance: The development objectives of the project maintained their relevance throughout the years of implementation. They are aligned to and support the public sector capacity
                         building and governance pillars in the Government's Poverty Reduction Strategies (2003-present), the World Bank Strategy for Africa (2011) as well as the Country Assistance

                         Strategies for Ethiopia (2003-present). The pillars are meant to address systemic constraints in human and institutional capacity as well as inadequate accountability and
                         transparency in order to provide better public service, empower citizens to participate in matters affecting their lives and promote transparency and accountability in the public sector.
                         Similarly the design features and implementation arrangements largely worked quite well during implementation of the project.

                         Efficiency: The reforms supported by the project were able to achieve a lot more than the activities indicated in the original five year action plan. The integration of the core public
                         sector reforms into one program and centralizing prototype development at federal level significantly reduced duplication of efforts by different sub-programs and different tiers of
                         government. Similarly, the use of in-house training of trainers, the learning by doing approach instead of fully depending on external consultants has also made significant savings
                         and strengthened local institutional capacity and ownership in a sustainable and efficient manner In civil service, a comprehensive business process review that looked into the
                         strategy of institutions, staffing, structures, and style of management replaced the limited quick wins approach and covered a lot more offices than was originally anticipated. In
                         decentralization, the good governance package attempted to streamline all principles of good governance (accountability, transparency, efficiency, effectiveness, rule of law,
                         participation and consensus building etc) rather than addressing only participation of citizens. It also helped to institutionalize the Kebeles (village) level administration in service
                         delivery and decision making process. In doing this, decentralization has helped to provide services to the population in an efficient way. The urban component managed to more
                         than double the target of masters’ level urban graduates from a planned target of 1000 to 2621 of which 2102 (80.2%) came from regions. Expenditure management and control
                         introduced program budgeting, fixed asset management systems, etc. in addition to rolling out the reforms initiated earlier. The Tax system reform initiated biometric system to
                         organize tax payers’ information and interfaced it with the existing tax identification number. Justice supported new initiatives like asset registration and disclosure and reforms in
                         legal education. Furthermore, based on the previous IFR, the operational cost for the project is 9.04% of the disbursed amount.

                         The project is targeted to meet its PDO: The project has substantially achieved the outputs and outcomes necessary for meeting the development objectives by the end of the
                         project. It has led to, inter alia, considerable improvement in government capabilities to: (i) raise and manage public resources more effectively, (ii) deliver improved public services,
                         and (iii) become more inclusive, transparent and accountable.

                         The capacity to raise and manage public funds more effectively has improved. The adequacy and predictability of financing is being as sured by the increase in revenue collection
                         and improvements made in budget planning, execution and reporting systems. Tax collection has increased nominally from 12.4 in 2005 to 70.7 billion Ethiopian Birr in 2011/12
                         which is double in real terms. The tax to GDP ratio has improved from 11.6% in 2005 to 12.4% in 2012. The low GDP ratio is largely explained by a lightly-taxed agricultural sector
                         that account for a big chunk of the GDP and significant number of Large State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) that heavily contribute to public investment but are also not heavily taxed.
                         Some estimates indicate that revenue relative to non-agricultural GDP could be close to 20 percent. The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessments
                         conducted in 2007 and 2010 showed improvement in 50% of the 28 indicators. The Woreda and City Benchmarking Supply Side Survey also confirmed that the percentage of local
                         jurisdictions that has shown efficiency and comprehensiveness of accounting and auditing procedures increased from 30% in 2005 to 85% in 2011 survey. In addition, budget
                         proclamations and expenditure reports also show narrowing in regional and local fiscal gaps through increased unconditional transfers and own revenues. Furthermore, the variation
                         between budgeted and actual expenditures has been reduced from 14% to 4% between 2005 and 2012.

                         Government's capacity to deliver efficient, responsive and transparent service to citizens has improved: This is mainly due to the rapid implementation of district level decentralization
                         and other reforms that addressed outdated legal and policy frameworks, unwieldy structures, cumbersome work processes and systems as well as shortage of important skills in the
                         public sector. The scaling up of district level decentralization from four regions to all regions has improved access to and responsiveness of the public services by bringing them
                         closer to citizens. The decentralization is supported by enabling legal framework (Constitutions, Proclamations) and restructuring of lower administrative units. According to the

                         2010/11 Woreda (District) and City Benchmarking Survey, 88% of the local jurisdictions are providing basic services compared to only 25% in 2005. Similarly, the business process
                         re-engineering has simplified cumbersome work processes, set service delivery standards, created one-stop shops for related services, introduced open work place designs and
                         established complaint handling mechanisms in 145 federal, 404 regional and over 19,600 district offices. The organizational and individual performance appraisal system known as
                         the Balanced Score Card (BSC) is being introduced in more and more number of institutions at different administrative levels. Processing time for tax collection decreased on the
                         average from over 4 hours to average of 15 minutes, opening files in courts from one day to 24 minutes and clearance rate for courts nationwide increased from 60% to 98% during
                         the project years. Congestion rate improved from more than 1:3.6 in 2005 to 1:1.5 in 2012.

                         Improved citizen’s satisfaction with services: The Woreda and City Benchmarking Survey confirmed satisfaction of citizens with basic services. For example, citizens using
                         government health facilities have increased from 50% in 2008 to 84% in 2011 in urban areas and from 77% to 94% in rural areas, respectively. Overall satisfaction with health
                         services increased from 62% to 70% while households satisfied with waiting times, attitudes of the medical staff, and availability of drugs increased from 66%, 66%, 53% in 2008 to
                         81%, 74% and 54% in 2011 respectively. II) The overall satisfaction with primary education services increased from 84% to 94%, with solid waste management from 70% to 74%,

                         and with agricultural extension services from 90% to 94% over the same period. The only sector where satisfaction has not improved is water supply, where satisfaction was dropped
                         from 61% in 2008 to 58% in 2011. However, there has been a 16% fall (from 26% to 10%) in the proportion of the population reliant on unprotected water sources over the past three
                         years.

                         Increased public participation and engagement: Reforms supported by the project promoted participation of citizens in the preparation and monitoring of plans. Various participatory
                         structures have been established including Councils, development committees, public meetings, and social shengos /mediators. These are complemented by operationalizing
                         manuals on public participation, integrated development plan, local development plan, capital investment plan etc. Membership of Kebele/Village Councils has been increased to 300
                         to ensure wider representation in the grassroots assemblies in most regions and 70-80 in pastoral regions. Over 16,663 Keble level government/CSO inspection committees
                         consisting of seven to nine members have been formed to ensure citizens’ participation and accountability of executives through formally established voluntary bi-annual public
                         meetings.

                         Transparency and accountability has been enhanced through establishment of information or complaint handling officers at federal, regional and woreda offices as well as recruitment
                         of over 15,415 Kebele Managers. More and more people have begun to demand their rights although this is still at its infancy. This is complemented by increasingly opening up
                         Woreda Council meetings to the public, posting budgets, use of service delivery formats and information technologies such as toll-free call centers (used by over 1000 users daily),
                         portals, and websites. This was also confirmed by the Woreda and City Benchmarking Survey by increased number of respondents who know public service information. Based on
                         the Woreda and City Benchmarking Survey, citizens who know what taxes and fees they are legally required to pay increased from 60% in 2008 to 81% in 2011. Those who know
                         their woreda budget and strategic plan increased from 13% and 17% in 2008 to 20% and 19% in 2011 respectively. Citizens who know council meetings are open to the public
                         increased from 11% in 2008 to 32% in 2011 while those who are personally consulted on development issues increased from 17% to 20% over the same period.

                         Other achievements: Ethiopia’s ranking for on-line service improved from 126 to 80 and for e-participation from 170 to 19 from a total of 174 countries on the UN E-Government Index
                         done between 2005 and 2011 following the expansion of both infrastructure and applications that enhance service delivery and transparency. Skills were strengthened through on the
                         job training, study tours and short and long-term distance training at Diploma, BA, MA, and PhD level. Some examples include the 2621 urban management graduates at Masters’
                         level and 2 at PhD level, over a 565 at MA and BA in taxation and customs, as well as over 10,600 graduates MA, BA and diploma level in a range of subjects including leadership,
                         accounting, public administration, law etc. The long term training has significantly increased the number of qualified civil servants and leaders at sub-national level. A huge number
                         of short term training courses and sensitization workshops have also been delivered by each sub-program on new laws, directives, working systems and reforms as well as to citizens
                         and taxpayers. For instance, the CSRP delivered training to over 736,207; the DLDP to over 7,743,404 ; (over in 2 million in Oromiya region alone); the JSRP to over 159,297; the
                         UMCBP to over 216,246; the ICT to over 140,456; the TSRP to over 307,082 (excluding tax payer education using different media) and the EMCP to over 45,505. In an assessment
                         made on training aspects of PSCAP, 87% of the responses were positive and speak well of the usefulness of the training courses they had taken. With regard to the urban sub-
                         program, currently about 700 cities have their own active master plans prepared by regions. This is a tremendous achievement compared to the 120 cities that used to have master
                         plan in the country when the only institute was the National Urban Planning Institute in its 10 years of life. This is a result of establishing and capacitating the regional planning
                         institute. Similarly many cities have prepared land grading and benchmark pricing to implement the lease policy.

                         Notwithstanding the above achievements, the public sector is still not strong in attracting, motivating and retaining sound professionals. It is noted that a number of human resources
                         management and development initiatives such as the development of job evaluation and grading, the introduction of balanced score card performance management system, the
                         development of a human resources management information system, and development of a code of conduct for the civil service are underway in the last two years. These are all e

                         ncouraging signs. However, it remains to be seen whether these initiatives will result in greater motivation and productivity. Similarly, although civil service salaries increased on
                         average by 15% in 2005, 23% in 2008, and 38% in 2011, these adjustments in pay have only partially compensated public servants for the loss of purchasing power. On the other
                         hand, the proportion of citizens reporting paying extra money to get public service increased from 4.3% in 2005 to 6.5% in 2011, (according to the Woreda and City Benchmarking
                         Survey), which suggests an increase in petty corruption. However, in the absence of the reform program, it is probable that petty corruption would have been much higher. Finally,

                         outcomes. One or more sub-programs may contribute for each of the outcomes. One of the binding agreements in the project is to initiate woreda/district and city level
                         benchmarking as one of the main monitoring tools. The Woreda and City Benchmarking Survey helped in creating the baselines and to measure progress over the years. The first

                         baseline in a limited number of jurisdictions (10%). In the subsequent three rounds the sample size increased to 38%, 50%, and 33% respectively including the initial (10%)
                         jurisdiction which are used for time series comparison. In addition the demand side of the survey covers more than 11,000 households in every round. The survey result indicates a
                         confidence interval of +/- 3 % at 95% confidence interval.
