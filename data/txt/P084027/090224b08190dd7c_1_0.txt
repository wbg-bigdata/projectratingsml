                         This is the last Implementation Status Report update before the project closing to reflect the overall project performance, including the project outcomes. This update also reflects the
                         outcomes of a project workshop including all held from December 27-28, 2012. The objective of the workshop was to take stock of the results framework, assess component
                         outcomes and review project implementation before project closing on January 31, 2013.

                         At the end of the operation, the project objective development (PDO) has been achieved. Target values for both municipal revenue collection and budget spending on investment and

                         maintenance have been met and in many cases exceeded. The PDO remains consistent and relevant with the Borrower’s urban development challenges as reflected in the National
                         Development Plan and the Bank Country Assistance Strategy.

                         The project had a disbursement rate of 73% as of January 12, 2013. Projected disbursement rate at end of grace period (May 31, 2013) is expected to be 88%. The project recorded

                         33% disbursement rate at the mid-term review in October 2010. After mid-term review and subsequent re-organization of activities in October 2010, the project activities were focused
                         on critical areas. A specific action plan was developed and successfully implemented, resulting in improved implementation.


                         For Component 1, the Municipal Support Program, performance is satisfactory for two out of five indicators. All six cities have adopted and are using transparent, standardized, and
                         efficient budget management procedures as specified in administrative management procedures manual. Following the effective implementation, the manual has been rolled out
                         nationwide and all 351 urban and rural communes of the country are now using the manual. Street addressing has been completed at 89% in 2011 against an original target of 80%.
                         However, only the first generation of the six city contracts have been signed against 19 expected. This was a result of the phasing out of the municipal contract approach in 2010
                         following the introduction of the Permanent Fund for local collectivities development (FPDCT). The remaining 13 cities did not develop contracts because they had benefitted from the
                         reform of the fiscal transfer system which provided them with direct transfers. Finally, municipalities’ budget allocations did provided adequate infrastructure maintenance according to
                         the rates listed in city contracts – average increases in budget spent on maintenance and infrastructure was more than 40% per city in 2011 (and has been consistently exceeding the
                         baseline in this area), compared to the baseline.

                         The increases in revenues from the Informal Sector Contribution tax (CSI – Contribution du secteur informel) have been satisfactory only for 2012. The results are not fully
                         comparable to the baseline since there was a change in size and boundaries of the urban areas leading to a reduction in the taxation potential for CSI. However, the combined
                         approach of street addressing and tax collection has triggered an overall improved performance and has improved local revenue collection, as reflected in the increase of municipal
                         revenue in the 6 target cities increasing from 8,342 million CFAF at project start to 17,324 million CFAF by completion.

                         Beyond the direct result and at the strategic level, the component has contributed to strengthen: (i) the budget support mechanism and financial transfer to local governments through
                         the support to the creation of the FPDCT (Permanent Development Fund for Local Governments) and support to preparation of municipal contracts and implementation, and (ii) the
                         capacities of urban communes to deliver services (financial, administrative, organizational). The operational achievements consist mainly in (i) significant capacity strengthening at
                         the municipal level with respect to mainstreaming of urban planning and municipal management mechanisms in 13 provincial capitals through development of municipal audits,
                         acquisition of goods, and access to training, (ii) the development of a software that integrates national and local finances software and improves municipal financial management at
                         the central government level; and training for staff in the 13 provincial capitals, (iii) consolidation of the national street addressing program and roll out of the program in 6
                         municipalities, and (iv) the implementation of the urban information system.

                         For Component 2, the results are satisfactory for 2 of 3 indicators (urban master plans for 12 cities and development and dissemination fo financial ratio guides), with one activity
                         (land titling) covered in a different project implemented by IFC.

                         Main outputs include: (i) providing 12 municipalities with urban master plans (SDAU) which are fundamental for management of the urban areas, in addition to the city Ouagadougou
                         which had already completed the “Grand Ouagadogou Master Plan?, (ii) improved financial management improvement through the development and dissemination of financial

                         guidelines, as well as training for the municipal staff in 49 cities; (iii) capacity strengthening at the central level aiming at supporting the municipalities through comprehensive support
                         provided to the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralization (MATD), Ministry of Finance and Budget (MFB), Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning (MHU) and the
                         Association of Municipalities of Burkina Faso (AMBF), including goods and training.

                         On the other hand, the project has not carried out any activities related to securing land titling for citizens in cities. These activities were dropped as it was supported by the IFC
                         operations pilot program "Doing Business". The Doing Business program in Burkina has worked from 2007 to 2011 on the issue of land properties, and more specifically on recording
                         the procedures necessary for a business to purchase a property from another business and to formally transfer the property title to the buyer’s name. This was very close to the
                         Project’s planned activity to extend the pilot operation on issuance of land ownership document (Land Title or Occupancy Permit). The IFC’s results on the matter consist in (i)
                         simplification of land title obtaining procedures and (ii) improving the land title delivering from 11 in 2006 to 4503 in 2011 at the national level, this is to say largely beyond the target
                         75% of the urban project.

                         At the beginning of the project, project management and implementation was partially constrained by capacity constraints, insufficient coordination and lack of effective collaboration
                         within and between the implementing agencies. However, following the reorganization of activities as part of the midterm review in 2010, project management improved significantly.
                         With regards to M&E, the project faced some initial challenges in collecting reliable data. However, these constraints were addressed by hiring on an M&E specialist.
