 BURKINA FASO – DECENTRALIZED URBAN CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT
                                       (P084027)

                                CREDIT NO. 4311-BUR


   A- SUMMARY

1. This Restructuring Paper proposes a level-two restructuring for Burkina Faso –
Decentralized Urban Capacity Building Project (Credit No. 4311-BUR). As requested by
the Government in the letter dated October 17, 2012, the proposed restructuring consists
of the following; (i) amendment of the Financing Agreement (Credit No. 4311-BUR) to
include a new category of expenditure (Incremental Operating Cost) under Schedule 2,
Section IV, A.2, Table of Eligible Expenditures, and; (ii) reallocation of the project
proceeds among the categories of expenditures as specified in Annex 1. This is the
second amendment to the Financing Agreement. The first amendment of October 5, 2009
was made to increase the procurement prior review thresholds for Burkina Faso.

2. The rationale: The rationale for amending the Financing Agreement to include
Incremental Operating Cost and reallocating project proceeds among categories of
expenditures is to allow disbursement of incremental operating costs under Credit No.
4311-BUR which were envisaged in the Project design and reflected in the Project
Appraisal Document (page 20, paragraph 54, and page 56, paragraph 163), but were
inadvertently not specified under Schedule 2, Section IV, A.2 (Table of Eligible
Expenditures) of the Financing Agreement. The costs incurred as incremental operating
cost were approved as eligible by the Bank from the beginning of the project up until
June 2012 when the issue was raised and disbursement was halted.

   B- PROJECT STATUS

3. Objective of the Project and Components. The International Development
Association (IDA) credit for Burkina Faso – Decentralized Urban Capacity Building
Project in the amount of SDR 6.70 million (US$ 10.30 million equivalent) was approved
by the Board on May 29, 2007, signed on June 22, 2007 and declared effective on
November 30, 2007. The project closes on January 31, 2013. The Project’s development
objectives are to strengthen the delivery of urban services at the municipal level with
special emphasis on Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso, Koudougou, Banfora, Ouahigouya,
and Kaya. The project consists of three components:

Component 1: Municipal Support Program (US$4.3 million equivalent). This component
will strengthen the technical and financial capacity of the communes of Ouagadougou,
Bobo-Dioulasso, Koudougou, Banfora, Ouahigouya, and Kaya to program, finance,
deliver and manage infrastructure and urban services. This is supplemented by activities
targeted at the remaining regional capitals. This component has three sub-components,
which defines the municipal contract's Municipal Support Program: (i) strengthening
programming and urban management capacity; (ii) strengthening financial resource
mobilization; and (iii) strengthening administrative and financial management of the
municipalities.

Component 2: Support to urban development institutions and stakeholders (US$2.6
million equivalent). This component will support cross-cutting activities that aim at
strengthening financial mechanisms to support decentralization and the capacity of
stakeholders involved in supporting municipalities in their effort to provide services to
their populations. This component includes: (i) transfer mechanisms and financing local
investments; (ii) urban planning; and (iii) institutional Strengthening.

Component 3: Project management, technical assistance, monitoring and evaluation
(US$1.7 million equivalent). The objective of this component is to strengthen national
capacity to coordinate programs, monitor performance of municipalities and institutions
involved in decentralized urban development. This includes: (i) management; (ii) project
monitoring and evaluation; and (iii) financial audits.

4. The project is progressing satisfactorily toward achieving its development
objectives. Project implementation had gradually improved by focusing on fewer and
more strategic activities and through improved project management by key counterparts
during this period. As of October 23, 2012, 67.89% of the project funds had been
disbursed.

5. The main achievements of the project include: (i) the ongoing completion of the
urban master plan (SDAU) studies for 12 selected cities; (ii) significant capacity
strengthening at the municipal level with respect to mainstreaming of urban planning and
municipal management mechanisms in 13 provincial capitals through development of
municipal audits, acquisition of goods, and access to training; (iii) improvement of
municipal financial management through the development and dissemination of financial
guidelines, as well as training for the municipal staff in 49 cities; (iv) the development of
a software that integrates national and local finances software and improves municipal
financial management at the central government level; and training for staff in the 13
provincial capitals; (v) consolidation of the national street addressing program and roll
out of the program in 6 municipalities; (vi) significant increase in the share of the
municipal budget allocated to infrastructure investments and maintenance far exceeding
the original project target values (from average 17% in 2005 to average 46% in 2010 for
the six cities, with individual cities substantially exceeding targets); (vii) significant
increase in own source revenue collection exceeding the original target values (on
average a 79% increase in own source revenue collected between 2005 to 2010 for the
six cities, with individual cities substantially exceeding targets); and (viii) capacity
strengthening at the central level aiming at supporting the municipalities through
comprehensive support provided to the Ministry of Territorial Administration and
Decentralization (MATD), Ministry of Finance and Budget (MFB), Ministry of Housing
and Urban Planning (MHU) and the Association of Municipalities of Burkina Faso
(AMBF), including goods and training.

   C- PROPOSED CHANGES

6. The total amount of incremental operating costs incurred and already disbursed as
of October 23, 2012 under Schedule 2, Section IV, A.2 (Category 1, 2 and 3 in the Table
of Eligible Expenditures) of the Financing Agreement is FCFA 62,453,331. In order to
render the amount incurred eligible, and to allow disbursement of incremental operating
costs until project closure, the Financing Agreement needs to be amended to include
“Incremental Operating Cost? under Schedule 2, Section IV, A.2 (Table of Eligible
Expenditures) to enable the CTRLA to record these expenditures as eligible. The Bank's
Team has no objection to the Government`s request and in line with Bank procedures has
agreed with LEGAF to restructure the project to make a change to the withdrawal
schedule of the Financing Agreement (Credit 4311-BUR). The Team proposes that the
disbursement table in Schedule 2, Section IV.A.2 of the Financing Agreement be
amended as shown below in annex 1. As indicated above, with this proposed amendment
the legal agreement will accurately reflect the project design as described in the PAD in
respect to the financing of the incremental operating costs (page 20, paragraph 54, and
page 56, paragraph 163). This will enable the Bank to disburse at 100% of incremental
operating cost under Category 1, 2 and 3 of the Table of Eligible Expenditures. In
addition, reallocations between categories of expenditures will be made to reflect actual
and projected expenditures.


   D- APPRAISAL SUMMARY

      Economic, financial and technical analysis: None of the proposed changes
       would have a major effect on the original economic, financial or technical
       analysis of the project as appraised

      Social and environment: The proposed restructuring would not result in any
       changes to the appraised social and environmental aspects.

      Exceptions to Bank Policy and risks: The proposed restructuring does not
       trigger new risks or exceptions to Bank policy

      Results Framework: No changes are envisaged to the Results Framework.
