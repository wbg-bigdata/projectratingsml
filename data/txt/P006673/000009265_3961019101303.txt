MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
CHILE FOR THE
SECONDARY EDUCATION QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed loan to the Republic of Chile for the equivalent of US$35 million to help
finance a Secondary Education Quality Improvement Project. The loan would be at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 15 years and five years of
grace. The Republic of Chile, represented by the Ministry of Finance (MEF), would be
the Borrower, and the Ministry of Education (MINEDUC) would be the Implementing
Agency.
2.    Country/Sector Background. When compared with other Latin American and
Caribbean countries, Chile displays impressive educational results. The average years
of schooling for Chilean adults (8 years) is among the highest in the region, while the
adult illiteracy rate (5.6 percent) is among the lowest. The major challenge now facing
Chile's educational system is how to train young people with the higher-order thinking
and problem-solving skills required by a growing economy that needs to be increasingly
competitive internationally. To face this challenge, the Government has increased real
public spending in education by approximately 25 percent since 1990, when only 3.7
percent of GDP was devoted to education. It plans to continue to increase the percentage
of GDP devoted to education until the figure reaches nearly 7 percent, expected by the
end of the century. To date, priority in educational spending has been given to preschool
and primary education to enhance quality, equity and efficiency through the Bank-
assisted Primary Education Improvement Project (Ln 3410-CH, known locally as
MECE). This is expected to set the conditions for development of a strategy to address
the relevant issues in secondary education, which serves as the key link to the country's
economy and labor market.
3.   In spite of the above-mentioned educational achievements, secondary education
faces an outdated curriculum and inadequate institutions, which adversely affect the
country's prospects of increasing productivity and long-term competitiveness in world
markets. Although gross enrollment for grades 9-12 is a high 76 percent, having
increased by over 30 percent since 1970, this figure does not reflect the high inefficiency
and inequality within the system, especially in secondary schools serving urban and rural
poor students. Repetition and dropout rates average 12 and 6.8 percent respectively for
the secondary education cycle, yet are as high as 16.2 percent and 9.8 percent
respectively during the first year. Levels of learning among secondary education
students, as manifested by cognitive assessments in Spanish and Math, are extremely
low, especially among students belonging to low-income households. Only 68 percent
of the cohort completes the full cycle, with large disparities between private schools
(87.7 percent) and municipal public schools (61.6 percent). Approximately 15.4 percent
of secondary graduates enter higher education, mostly from private schools teaching a



-2-
scientific-humanistic (S-H) curriculum, while the rest are ill-prepared for entry into the
labor market. In general, secondary schools, especially those following the technical-
vocational track (T-VOC), lack clear linkages with the productive sector. The result is
a growing mismatch between the system's outcomes (students' level of preparation) and
demands of students, parents and employers. Finally, there is weak institutional and
managerial capacity at the secondary level, hindering the transformation of educational
policies and strategies into effective programs at the school level.
4.     The Chilean secondary education system is characterized by: (i) low external
efficiency, which results from an outdated and rigid curriculum structure, a low capacity
to adequately monitor and evaluate implementation of the intended curriculum, and a
weak linkage to the productive sectors; (ii) low internal efficiency, which is manifested
in high repetition and dropout rates (12.0 and 6.8 percent, respectively), and long
average number of years (5.3 years) to complete the four-year secondary cycle; (iii) low
quality and inequity, as displayed by unsatisfactory levels of learning in Spanish and
Math, especially among low-income students; and (iv) weak sectoral institutional
capacity, which is characterized by the inability to effectively transform educational
policies and strategies into concrete programs, periodically monitor sector achievements,
administer educational resources at the municipal level, and implement technical-
pedagogical supervision at the school level.
5.    The Government has focused on educational modernization as its top priority for
the next six years. With this objective in mind, the Government has formulated a
proposal to improve secondary education in three steps:  first, the immediate
implementation of a "Pilot Program", initiated in September 1994, comprising limited
targeted activities in 124 secondary schools throughout the country; second,
implementation of a more comprehensive "Quality Improvement Program" in the short
and medium-term, with the help of the Bank, comprising a wide range of activities that
would address the system's overall low quality, internal and external inefficiencies, and
inequities in all of the 1,600 publicly financed secondary schools in the country; and
thirdly, the implementation of a "structural reform" in the long run for the entire
secondary education system, building upon the two previous steps.
6.    Project Objectives. The project seeks to improve the internal and external
efficiency, quality, and equity of all the municipal and government-subsidized private
secondary schools (about 1,600), and to strengthen sectoral managerial capacity.
7.    Project Description. The project would improve external efficiency (11 percent
of total base costs) by: (a) establishing a Curriculum Planning and Evaluation Unit
(CPEU) to reformulate the subject-based curriculum, for both the S-H and T-VOC
secondary schools, to enhance the teaching and learning of higher-order thinking and
problem-solving skills; (b) developing evaluation capacity to monitor the consistency
between the recommended (official) and the learned curriculum; (c) establishing
alternative curricular activities for socially and educationally at-risk secondary students;



-3-
and (d) providing incentives to strengthen the linkages between targeted T-VOC
secondary schools and the private sector in curriculum development, skill certification,
in-service teacher training, and the use of physical facilities. The project would improve
quality, equity, and internal efficiency (81.1 percent of total base costs) by: (e)
providing in-service teacher training to change the predominantly one-dimensional
teaching format based mainly on rote learning and dictation, to more interactive methods;
(f) establishing a fund to promote the design and implementation of school-based
educational development projects (PDEs); and (g) providing educational resources
(textbooks, school libraries, teaching materials, computers, and infrastructure) in a
targeted manner. Additionally, the project would strengthen sectoral managerial
capacity (4.4 percent of total base costs) by: (h) building upon existing institutional
strengthening activities financed by the Bank-assisted Primary Education Improvement
Project (MECE) within the current administrative structure of the Ministry of Education
(MINEDUC) and the municipalities; (i) strengthening the managerial and leadership
capacity of principals and the heads of school-curricular subject areas; and (j) establishing
and maintaining a technical support network (TSN) consisting of universities,
professional institutes, local and international experts, the private sector, and NGOs
which would provide technical assistance to participating secondary schools in training,
development of learning materials and curricular needs.   Project management
expenditures account for the remaining 3.5 percent of total base costs.
8.    The total cost of the project, to be implemented in six years (1995-2000), is
estimated at US$207 million equivalent based on September 1994 prices. The project
would be financed in part by a Bank loan of US$35 million, or 16.9 percent of total
project cost. The loan would cover 45 percent of foreign exchange expenditures and
about 13 percent of estimated local costs (excluding taxes). The Borrower would finance
US$172 million equivalent (83.1 percent of total project cost) including duties and taxes,
starting in calendar year 1995. Table 1 of Schedule A summarizes the estimated project
costs by component. Tables 2 and 3 of Schedule A provide the project financing plan
and the breakdown by expenditure category. Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursements, and the allocation of loan proceeds are shown in Schedule B, Tables 1,
2, and 3, respectively. The Government of Chile did not solicit retroactive financing for
this project. Schedule C provides the timetable of project processing. The status of
Bank Group operations in Chile are given in Schedule D. A map is attached, and the
Staff Appraisal Report No. 13880-CH, dated April 11, 1995, is being circulated. The
completion date for the project would be December 31, 2000, and the closing date would
be June 30, 2001.
9.    Project Implementation. Project execution would be coordinated by a Project
Coordination Unit (PCU), hereafter referred to as MECE-EM PCU. A National
Coordinator would be in charge of the PCU, and would be assisted by a Secondary
Education Project Coordinator and Deputy Coordinator. The MECE-EM PCU reports
to the Minister and Undersecretary of Education through the National Coordinator, which
also is in charge of managing the MECE Project. The MECE-EM PCU would assist



-4-
MINEDUC in overseeing the project's implementation and general coordination, and
ensuring that the project is carried out according to established guidelines, procedures,
and agreed targets. The MECE-EM PCU consists of a small matrix-type managerial
organization with six program units (reformulation of curriculum and development of
evaluation capacity; altemative curricular activities for socially and educationally at-risk
students; in-service teacher training; school-based quality development projects;
educational resources; and infrastructure) and four support units (project planning,
programming and monitoring; procurement, technical assistance, and personnel;
budgeting, financing, disbursement, accounting, and auditing; and legal affairs). No new
support units would be established for this project. Instead, the project would utilize
MECE's four existing support units. The program units would coordinate and monitor
the implementation of their respective project components through MINEDUCs central,
regional, and provincial structures.
10.   Project Sustainability. Projected incremental annual recurrent expenditures that
will result from the project for the period 2001 through 2010, estimated at US$9.4
million equivalent, represent about 0.5 percent of MINEDUC's total projected budget for
the year 2001 (or 3.0 percent of MINEDUC's projected secondary education budget).
This increase is affordable by the Borrower, especially considering that the Government
has assigned the highest priority to this sector. The Borrower's commitment to support
the project is reflected in adequate counterpart funding of US$13.4 million equivalent
authorized by the Chilean Congress in its Budget Law of CY95.
11.   Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement. Bank assistance in Chile's
education sector consists of four projects, three of which were implemented more than
20 years ago. In view of the time elapsed, the more relevant lessons originate from the
Bank's ongoing fourth project (MECE, for US$170 million), approved in 1991, as well
as Bank lending in other countries with projects containing components of a similar
nature to the ones proposed by Chile. These lessons reflect the need to: (a) define
project objectives and components clearly; (b) limit the number of project components
and simplify their purpose; (c) develop a sense of ownership by the borrower; (d)
implement educational innovations on a pilot scale before they are widely replicated; and
(e) train the PCU in Bank procurement, disbursements, accounting, and auditing
procedures before project effectiveness. All of these lessons have been incorporated into
the project's design.
12.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Government of Chile and the Bank have
recently agreed upon a new assistance modality that reflects Chile's continued desire for
the Bank's technical assistance and advisory services along with its reduced need for
resource transfers in view of its strong external position. The first Country Assistance
Strategy document for Chile, which reflects this new assistance modality, is being
prepared for Board discussion together with this project. A key feature of the Bank's
strategy is the emphasis on selectivity, focusing both sector work and limited new lending
exclusively on key areas identified by the Government as priorities in its development



-5-
agenda. One of these key areas in which the Government has requested Bank assistance
is the education sector.  The education sector has been singled out as this
Administration's highest priority, both to increase productivity and to further improve
social conditions. The Govemment looks for the Bank's assistance in this project in view
of our already close involvement under previous and ongoing operations in the sector.
The Govemment also seeks to benefit from the Bank's intemational experience in
secondary education, considered of fundamental importance toward improving the
country's international competitiveness and meeting its future economic growth
objectives. The project is consequently fully consistent with the country assistance
strategy for Chile.
13.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations, the Borrower confirmed: (a) the date,
scope and content of the Mid-Term Review agreed during the appraisal mission; (b) that
the project's performance and impact indicators would be included in the Operational
Manual; and (c) that an annual progress report on project implementation would be
submitted to the Bank for its review not later than June 30 of each year, starting in 1996.
14.   As conditions of Loan effectiveness the Bank would require that: (a) a PCU,
under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, be established and staffed by
MINEDUC under qualifications agreed with the Bank; (b) an Operational Manual of
MECE-EM, satisfactory to the Bank, be adopted by MINEDUC; (c) standard bidding
documents, acceptable to the Bank, for the ICB and LCB procurement of computer
equipment be adopted by MINEDUC; (d) FY96 counterpart funding for MECE-EM be
submitted to Congress for its approval; and (e) a legal opinion on behalf of the Borrower,
satisfactory to the Bank, by a counsel acceptable to the Bank, with respect to the validity
and execution of the Loan Agreement, be furnished to the Bank.
15.   As a condition for disbursement of PDE subprojects, selected schools would
enter into an arrangement with MINEDUC, satisfactory to the Bank, through the
Ministerial Regional Secretariats. Such an agreement would be a prerequisite to Bank
financing of any subproject.
16.   Poverty Category. The project will cover investments in all of the country's
municipal  and  private-subsidized  secondary  schools,  which  are  attended
disproportionately by low-income individuals.
17.   Environmental Aspects. The project does not present environmental risks other
than the relatively minor ones associated with school infrastructure projects (rehabilitation
and minor construction). These will be addressed in the design and approval stage of
school projects. The project has an environmental rating of "C".
18.   Program Objective Categories. The project fits the program object category of
poverty reduction and human resource development. Its objectives are to improve the
external and internal efficiency, quality, equity, and governance of secondary education.



-6-
19.   Participatory Approach. Project preparation was carried out and financed by
the Government and enjoys total support from Chile's educational and financial
authorities. Project preparation involved: (i) 13 research studies financed under the
MECE project and carried out by more than 200 highly qualified professionals from 13
universities, three independent educational research centers, and the teacher's union; and
(ii) a public consultation process involving more than 35,000 parents, teachers, students,
community leaders, and scholars. Several project components will be implemented with
the participation of NGOs and local communities.
20.   Project Benefits. The project would lead to cost savings and efficiency gains as
a result of reducing the number of secondary education students repeating grades and/or
dropping out of school. Similarly, the project would generate economic benefits accruing
to students who do not repeat or become dropouts as a result of the project, and whose
labor market performance would improve.  Other benefits include: (a) increased
productivity stemming from a more educated and trainable labor force with higher-order
thinking and problem-solving skills; (b) increased social mobility, especially for low-
income students; and (c) reduced social inequality stemming from targeted project
interventions. Finally, the project would further strengthen managerial capacity in
MINEDUC, in municipalities, and in secondary schools.
21.   Risks and Safeguards. The major risks associated with project implementation
are: (a) possible distortions in targeting project interventions; (b) possible difficulties by
some secondary schools, especially those serving socially and educationally at-risk
students, in integrating the different lines of action of the project; and (c) possible
development of non-practical learning material prototypes (with new curricular content)
by the project that are not easily assimilated by teachers.  These risks would be
minimized by: (a) defining precise targeting criteria to benefit schools located in poor
urban and rural areas; (b) implementing project components through a school-demand-
driven approach, and by allowing time for learning by doing; and (c) soliciting from the
TSN learning material prototypes (with new curricular content) including concrete and
simple teaching examples which would highlight the competencies they intend to develop.
22.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.
