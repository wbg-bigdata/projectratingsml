TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO ELECTRICITY CODISSION PROJECT
SUtITAIRY
This report covers an appraisal of a project of the Trinidad
and Tobago Electricity Commission (T&TEC), consisting of the first stage
of the Port of Spain "B" thermal power station, the construction of a
pipeline to supply natural gas to the station, and the expansion of trans-
mission and distribution facilities. A Bank loan of US$23.5 million
equivalent has been requested to cover the foreign exchange cost of the
project, the total cost of which is estimated to be the equivalent of
US$37.7 million.
ii.       The borrower would be the Territory of Trinidad and Tobago which
would in turn relend to the T&TEC.
iii.      The project will provide 100 MW of additional generating capacity
at Port of Spain, the capital city and main load center in Trinidad.
Although the initial capacity of the Port of Spain "B" station will be
100 kV it is being designed for an ultimate capacity of 220 MW and many
features, such as the cooling water system, will be suitable for this
capacity. The output of the station will be fed into the T&TEC
transmission system which covers most of the more densely populated and
industrialized areas of Trinidad and which is being extended to supply
new areas.
iv.       The natural gas pipeline will be about 41 miles in length and
will bring gas from oil fields at Penal to the Port of Spain area. The
capacity of the pipeline will be sufficient to meet the requirements of
the Port of Spain "B" station, the existing Port of Spain "All station and
estimated industrial requirements in the Port of Spain area over the next
20 years. The well head cost of natural gas will be less than one-third
the cost of fuel oil, the only other available fuel.
vs        The project is technically sound, the estimated cost is
reasonable and construction schedules are realistic.
vi.       The T&TEC is well managed and operated, its organization is
sound and it is capable of constructing and operating the project.
vii,      The Ordinance which governs the T&TEC's operations, as now
amended, is satisfactory.
viii.     The financial position of the T&TEC is sound.  The return
on investment is expected to average about 7% during the next 10 years,
This is adequate as the Commission should be able to cover 46% of its
capital requirements for expansion during this period out of internal
resources,



- ii -
ixo       A rate covenant and a debt limitation covenant satiofactory
to the Bank were agreed upon during negotiations.
xe        Before the loan becomes effective the contract for a supply
of natural gas from July 16, 1962 to December 31, 1973, which the T&TEC
has negotiated with Shell Trinidad Ltd., will be signed.
xi.       The increase in power demands in the service area justifies
the project, which offers the most economical means of providing the re-
quired generating capacity and additional transmission and distribution
facilities.
xii.      The project is considered suitable for a Bank loan of US$23.5
million equivalent, for a period of 20 years, including a grace period
of 4h  years on amortization payments.



TRINIDAD AIJD TOBAGO  LECTR-ICITY COTh`ISSTOLT PROJE3CT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        This report covers the appraisal of a proiect of the Trinidad and
Tobago Electricity Commission (T&TEC) consisting of the first stage of the
Port of Spain "B" thermal power station with an installed capacity of 100 lrlJ,
the provision of a pipeline, some 41 miles in length, to supply natural gas
to the power station, and the expansion of transmission and distribution
facilities. The project is part of the T&TEC 1961-1965 expansion program,
estimated to cost U'IM7-.8 million (USh41.4 million).
2.         The estimated cost of the project is FWI$64.1 million (US$37.7
million). The Bank has been asked to make a loan to cover the foreign ex-
change cost, excluding interest during construction, estimated to be equiva-
lent to US$23.5 million.
3.        The borrower would be the Torritory  of Trinidad and Tobago which
would in turn relend to the T&TEC.
4i.       This report is based on information submitted to the Bank by the
Government and the T&TEC, and on the findings of Bank missions which visited
Trinidad in April 1959, October 1960 and April 1961.
II.  THE ELECTRIC POYTR INDUSTRY IN TRTNIDAD
Public Electricity Supplies
5.        A public electricity supply was initiated in Trinidad on December 9,
1386, when a 20-year franchise was granted to a local company to operate a
supply and tramway system in Port of Spain, the capital city. The company
was purchased in March 1901 by a Canadian company which was then granted a
30-year franchise. The franchise period was subsequently extended to 36 years.
6.        On July 1, 1937, a Government appointed Board, the Trinidad
Electricity Board, acquired the Canadian company's system. The Board extended
the area of supply and by 1940 the town of Arima, 16 miles east of the city,
was receiving a supply.
7.        On January 1, 1946 the assets and responsibilities of the Trinidad
Electricity Board were divided between two new authorities, the Port of Spain
Corporation Electricity Board, which became responsible for distribution
within the city and for the tramway system, and the Trinidad and Tobago
Electricity Commission (T&TEC).  The T&TEC became the sole public generating
authority in Trinidad and Tobago, with the exception of the Borough of San
Fernando which had operated a small diesel power station since 1922 to supply



- 2 -
electricity within the Borough, and the sole distributing authority, outside
the boundaries of Port of Spain and San Fernando.  During its first year of
operation T&TEC generated 35 million kwh. In 1960 the kwh generated totalled
260.9 million, over seven times the number generated in 1946.  In 1946 T&TEC
supplied 6,613 consumers in towns and villages outside Port of Spain. By
December 31, 1960 the number of consumers had increased to 62,018.
8.        The Port of Spain Corporation Electricity Board has been supplied
in bulk by the T&TEC since 1946 to meet all its requirements within the four
square miles of the city. The Board closed down its tramway system in 1956.
9.        The San Fernando Borough Council continued to operate its diesel
power station (1.7 PiWI capacity) until May 1954. Since this date a bulk
supply has been taken from T&TEC for retailing within the 2.5 square miles
of the Borough.
10.       On April 20, 1961 the assets and liabilities of both the Port of
Spain Corporation Electricity Board and the San Fernando Borough Council
Electricity Department were transferred to the T&TEC which is now the sole
public generating and distributing authority in Trinidad and Tobago.
Other Electricity Supplies
11.       A number of oil companies and other industrial concerns, such as
sugar companies, which are situated in the southern and western parts of
Trinidad, have their own generating plants.  Most of these concerns commenced
operations before a public supply became available in these areas. The
Ordinance governing the T&TEC provides for licenses to be issued for such
installations by the Governor in Council. Installations already in operation
when the T&TEC was established in 19h6 were automatically granted licenses.
Since 1946 licenses for new installations and for extensions to existing
installations have only been granted after the Governor in Council has con-
sulted the T&TEC and is satisfied that the Commission cannot provide an
adequate supply on reasonable terms or that to insist on such a supply would
interfere with the economical and efficient working of the business. The
present installed capacity of generating plant operating under license is
about 55 F1w.
III. THE TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO ELECTRICITY CONlYiISSION (T&TEC)
12.       The T&TEC is a statutory corporation of the Government of Trinidad
and Tobago with perpetual succession and common seal with power to acquire
land by condemnation. The Commission may sue and be sued in its corporate
name. It was established by the Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission
Ordinance No. 42 of 1945, and commenced operations on January 1, 1946.
13.       The Bank, in September 1959, after the findings of the mission
which visited Trinidad earlier in the year had been considered, informed the
Government that the Ordinance was too restrictive and amendments in a satis-
factory form giving the Commission greater freedom to run its own affairs



- 3 -
in accordance with sound business and utility practices would be required
before negotiations for a loan could proceed. The Bank also informed the
Government that it agreed weith the Government's proposals for the unifica-
tion of public utility supplies in Trinidad and Tobago by the transfer of
the distribution systems operated by the Port of Spain Corporation Electricity
Board and the San Fernarndo Borough Council to the T&TEC and suggested arend-
ments to the Ordinance also be made to accomplish this.
14.       The Government agreed to make the amendnents in a form satisfactory
to the Bank, and on April 15, 1961 an Ordinance No. 8 of 1961 to amend the
Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission Ordinance was approved by the
Legislative Council and came into operation on April 20, 1961. The amended
Ordinance meets all the Bank's requirements and umifies public electricity
supplies in Trinidad and Tobago, making T&TEC the sole public generating and
distributing authority.
Organization and Management
15.       The Ordinance, as amended, provides for a Commission to be appointed
by the Governor in Council, consisting of a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman and
not less than five or more than eight other members. The rembers will be
appointed from persons appearing to the Governor in Council to be qualified
by reason of having had experience of and shown capacity in, matters relating
to utilities, electricity supply, industry, trade, finance, science or adminis-
tration, for periods not exceeding five years.  Members will be eligible for
re-appointment. All members holding office on April 20, 1961 will continue
to serve for their appointed periods.
16.       The chief executive officer of the T&TEC is the General Nanager,
who is appointed by the Commission. The present General Manager is a capable
and experienced engineer and able administrator who has held this position
since June 1951. About 5020 of the senior posts in the T&TEC are held by
local officers and the percentage is steadily increasing. The T&TEC is well
managed and operated, the caliber of its senior staff is high, and its
organization, which has been built up over the past 15 years, is sound and
adequate to meet present requirements and those of the foreseeable future.
On the basis of its past performance the T&TEC should be fully capable of
constructing and operating the project.
Facilities of the T&TEC
17.       The installed generating capacity of the T&TEC totals 30.0 1T,1,
consisting of 72.5 'TI of steam plant and 6.0 :W of diesel plant in Trinidad
and 1.5 ;'XT of diesel plant in Tobago.
18.       In Trinidad there are two thermal poTer stations, one at Port of
Spain with an installed capacity of 28.5 CZT and another at Penal, some 45
miles south of Port of SDain, with an installed capacity of 50 lIT. The
capacity of the Penal station will be increased by 20 1EJ when plant under
construction and scheduled for completion in December 1961, is commissioned.



- 4 -
19.       The Port of Spain station has 6 !n,T of diesel plant and 22.5 N:
of steam plant.  The station uses Bunker "C" fuel oil, and as it is costly
to operate it is used chiefly for peaking purposes. The Penal steam power
station uses natural gas costing about one-third the cost of fuel oil, and
is operated as a base load plant. Both these stations feed into the T&TEC
transmission system.
20.       In Tobago, a small island situated about 19 miles north-east of
Trinidad, the T&TEC operate a diesel power station with an installed capacity
of 1.5 iTJ. The station is costly to operate and will soon be too small to
meet increasing demands. Instead of installing additional plant, TMTEC plan
to supply the island from the Trinidad system by submarine cable and keep the
existing diesel plant for standby purposes. This arrangement should result
in considerable savings being made. This scheme is not included in the pro-
posed project.
21.       The T&TOC transmission and distribution systems supplied by the Port
of Spain and Penal power stations cover most of the more densely populated and
industrialized areas of Trinidad, which are situated in the northern, southern
and western parts of the island. The systems are being extended to cover
other areas. Prior to April 20, 1961, the city of Port of Spain and the
Borough of San Fernando were supplied in bulk but as from that date the two
distribution systems have been taken over by the T&TEC. A map showing the
T&TEC's generating stations and main transmission and distribution lines is
attached as an annex.
22.       The main transmission system consists of a double circuit 66 kv
line and a single circuit 132 kv line between Port of Spain and Penal pojer
stations. There are a number of 66/33 kv substations and a network of 33 kv
primary distribution lines. Secondary distribution is carried out at 12 kv
and 6.6 kv and residential consumers are supplied at 115/230 volts, 60 cycles
single phase.
IV. THE POTER IHRKET
23.       The combined retail sales of electricity in Trinidad and Toba7Yo by
the T&TEC, the Port of Spain Corporation Electricity Board, and the San Fernando
Borough Council have increased at an average rate of 17.5,% per annum over the
last five years, the increase for 1960 being 17.7%. The total number of
consumers supplied has risen from 58,170 in 1956 to 88,520 in 1960, an increase
of 52.2%.
24.       Up to April 20, 1961, the T&TEC supplied the Port of Spain Corporation
and the San Fernando Borough Council in bulk and these supplies accounted for
about 40% of TaTEC's sales over the last five years.
25.       The market for power can be broadly divided into four main catego-
ries:  (a) domestic sales, (b) commercial sales, (c) industrial sales and (d)



street lighting sales. Annex 1 shows the sales for the years 1956-1960 broken
down into these categories which inay be summarized as follows:
Retail Sales in Trinidad and Tobago
Percentage      Five Year
Sales During    Percentage   Increase          Average
1960         of Total      in 1960 over    Annual
Type of Use       (Mill. of kwh)   Sales         Previous Year   Increase
Domestic              52.3            24.h%         15.2%           15.1%
Commercial            27.0           12.6           13.4            13.2
Industrial          130.7            61.o           19.8            19.6
Street Lighting        4.3            2.0           13.1            19.8
21             100.0%          17.7%           17.5
Sales in Tobago amounted to about 1% per annum of the above totals.
26.       The high rate of increase in retail sales is largely due to the
growth of industrial sales which have more than doubled during the last five
years and now account for 61% of total sales.
Forecast of Sales
27.       The forecast of retail sales for the years 1961-1970 is given in
Annex 1. The pattern of sales during this period is not expected to change
but a decline in the rate of increase is expected. The rate of increase is
influenced by the industrial expansion which is now taking place in Trinidad
and which is expected to cause an increase of 18.3% in 1961 and 17.4% in
1962 in total retail sales. There are no definite commitments for large
industrial supplies after 1962, and the rate of increase in total retail sales
is expected gradually to diminish until it reaches 7.5% in 1970. The esti-
mated average rate of increase per annum over the next 10 years is 11.3%,
which is reasonable.
28.       Since April 20, 1961, when the distribution systems of the Port of
Spain Corporation Electricity Board and the San Fernando Borough Council were
taken over by the T&TEC, all consumers, totalling about 29,000, previously
supplied by the two authorities have been supplied directly by T&TEC. The
total number of consumers supplied by T&TEC is now about 92,000. Sales by
the T&TEC from April 20, 1961 onwards are, therefore, all retail and as it
is now the sole public generating and distributing authority the forecast
of its sales for the years 1961-1970 is as shown in Annex 1.
Growth in Demand
29.       The maximum demand on the T&TEC system has increased from 27.6 TVJ
in 1956 to 49.2 IN in 1960 and is expected to reach 149.0 NJ in 1970.  The
actual increase Der annum has averaged 15.6, per annum and the average increase



- 6 -
per annum forecast to 1970 is 11.8%. A table showing the actual and estimated
kwh generated and system maximum demands, based on the actual and estimated
sales for the years 1956 through 1970 is attached as Annex 2. A chart is
attached as Annex 3 which shows the curve of system maxi im  demand in relation
to installed and firm generating capacity. By reference to the chart it will
be seen that firm generating capacity is sufficient to meet present demands.
Another 20 1+1 set is under construction at Penal power station and is due for
commissioning in December 1961, which should just be in time to meet estimated
demands.
New Plant Requirements
30.       The system demand is, however, expected to exceed firm generating
capacity, including the 20 7,T set under construction, by May 1964. T&T3C
proposes to construct a new thermal station in Port of Spain with two 50 ni
sets. The first 50 mW set is scheduled for completion in December 1964 and
the second in December 1965.  (This station is included in "The Project"
described below.) Between May 1964 and the commissioning of the first 50 iW
set in December 1964 will be a critical period if system demand increases
as expected, as adequate standby plant will not be available and any plant
breakdown will result in load shedding. Every effort should therefore be made
to ensure that the scheduled commissioning date for the first 50 PhJ set is
not delayed. After the second 50 I141T set is commissioned sufficient capacity
should be available to meet demands until late 1970. The T& TEC plan to have
a third unit with a capacity of 60 ciJ in commission at the Port of Spain "B"
station by October 1970.
V. THE PROJECT
31.       The project proposed for Bank financing consists of the first stage
of the Port of Spain "B" thermal po-wer station with an installed capacity of
100 N!AI, which is to be constructed adjacent to the existing Port of Spain
"A" power station, the construction of a pipeline some 41 miles in length to
supply natural gas to both power stations, and the expansion of transmission
and distribution facilities. The location of the station and the route of
the pipeline are shown on the map attached as an annex.
32.       The new station will be of the semi-outdoor type.  The structure
will be steel framed and will be covered with light weight insulated cladding,
Although the initial capacity of the station will be 100 Ki it is being de-
signed for an ultimate capacity of 220 ,,,T and many features, such as cooling
water culverts and flumes, will be suitable for the ultimate capacity. Sea
water will be used for cooling purposes.
33.       The generating plant will consist of two 50 IiV.I1 turbo-alternator sets
and two 475,000 lb. per hour boilers. This size of plant has been selected
having regard to the expected system load conditions. The turbines will be
designed to operate with steam conditions of 900 lbs. per square inch and
9000F. The boilers will be of the outdoor type, suitable for operation on
natural gas or Bunker "C" fuel oil.



- 7 -
34.       Natural gas with a calorific value of about 1000 B.T.U. per cubic
foot will normally be used as fuel. The gas will be delivered by a 16 inch
diameter pipeline from oil fields at Penal in southern Trinidad. The capacity
of the pipeline will be sufficient to supply the existing Port of Spain "A"
station, the ultimate capacity of the Port of Spain 'tB" station and estimated
industrial requirements in the Port of Spain area over the next 20 years.
35,       Plentiful supplies of natural gas are available, a conservative
estimate of known resources being 1,000,000 million cubic feet. The total
estimated requirement during the next 20 years to supply T&TECts Penal and
Port of Spain "All and "B" power stations and industrial users in the Port of
Spain area is about 250,000 million cubic feet. At the present time only the
Penal station operates on natural gas, which costs, at the well head, about
]RI 23.13 cents (US 13.6 cents) including royalty. A contract for a supply
of gas to meet all its requirements from July 16, 1962 to December 31, 1973
at much lower prices has been negotiated by T&TEC with Shell Trinidad Ltd.,
who own and operate oil fields producing gas in the Penal area. Under the
contract the well head price of gas will be EWI 17.0 cents (US 10.0 cents) up
to December 31, 1968 and then EWI 17.5 cents (US 10.29 cents) up to December
31, 1973. These prices compare favorably with US and Venezuelan well head
prices for natural gas. A royalty of IWI 1.5 cents for 1000 cubic feet has
to be paid in addition which will make the total cost of gas to T&TEC EWI 18.5
cents (US 10.9 cents) and EWI 19.0 cents (US 11.2 cents) per 1000 cubic feet.
The steam conditions selected for the "B" station have been determined with
regard to the low cost of natural gas as fuel, which on a heat value basis is
less than one-third the cost of fuel oil, the only other available fuel.
36.       The station will be operated as a base load plant and during 1966,
the first full year of operation with two 50 MW sets in commission, the output
is estimated at 354 million kwh, representing an annual load factor of 54%.
The output of the station will be stepped up from 11 kv to 33 kv by two 62.5
NvIVA transformers and fed into an existing 33 kv switchyard adjacent to the
Port of Spain "AA" station.
37.       The existing transmission and distribution systems of the T&TEC
will be reinforced to take care of increasing loads and will also be extended
to supply new areas. The distribution systems previously operated by the
Port of Spain Corporation and the San Fernando Borough Council will be re-
constructed to operate at 6.6 kv instead of 2.3 kv which is now too low a
voltage to cope with the increasing loads.
38.       A more detailed description of the project is given in Annex 4.
Status of Engineering
39.       The Port of Spain "B" station has been planned and is being designed
by the Ccmmission's consultants, Preece, Cardew & Rider, of London, in asso-
ciation with Howard Humphreys & Sons, also of London, who are responsible for
civil works aspects. The consultants will supervise the construction of the
station. Preliminary engineering work on site has been completed, design
work is well advanced and specifications for the supply and erection of plant
and equipment and for civil works are being prepared.

40.       Howard Humphreys & Sons are planning and designing the natural gas
pipeline and will be resnonsible for supervising its construction.  Tle route
is now being surve-rd and riglhts of war 2re being obtained.
41.       The planning and design of exoansions to the transmission and
distribution systems are being carried out by the engineering staff of the
T&TEC with assistance from Preece, Cardew & Rider. The T&TEC will be re-
sponsible for all construction work.
42.       International bids will be invited for civil works and for the supply
and erection of plant and equipment in accordance with the Bankts require-
ments.  International bids have already been obtained and orders placed for
some of the materials and equipment required for the expansion of transmission
and distribution facilities.
Construction Schedules
43.       WTork on the expansion of transmission and distribution facilities
commenced on January 1, 1961.  Work on the gas pipeline is due to commence
in July 1961 and on civil works in August 1961.  The first 50 ih^ set is
scheduled for commissioning in December 1964 and the second 50 N2IJ set, which
rill complete the project, in December 1965.
44.       The scheduled dates for the commencement and completion of the main
features of the project are as follows:

Estimated Cost
46.       The total estimated cost of the project and the estimated cost of
the principal features are shown in the following table. (A more detailed
breakdown of costs is cgiven in the project description in Annex 4.)

27.55       10.14          37.69          64.07
47.       The cost estimates are realistic and should be adequate.  The sums
included for contingencies should be sufficient to cover any normal increases
in the cost of labor and materials and to provide a reasonable margin to
cover increases in civil engineering costs which may arise due to construc-
tional difficulties.



- 10 -
Unit Construction and Generation Costs
48.       The estimated cost of the project, including interest during con-
struction, is WIQ`64.07 million, or US637.69 million.  This includes pro-
vision for the Port of Spain "B" station, the gas pipeline, and for the ex-
pansion of transmission and distribution facilities. The estimated cost of
the Port of Spain "B" station alone, excluding interest during construction,
is B1I,427.28 million or US@16.04 million, which is equal to a cost of
31iIJ272.8 or USj160.4 per kw installed. This is a reasonable unit cost,
especially so as some features such as cooling water tunnels and flumes are
designed for the ultimate capacity of the station.
49.       The estimated cost of energy generated by the Port of Spain "B"
station in 1966, the first full year of operation with the two 50 NW sets
in commission, is BWI 1.64 cents (US 9.t6mills) per kwh sent out, which is
reasonably low cost thermal power. This cost includes all fixed and operat-
ing costs for both the stations and the gas pipeline. Details of generating
costs are given in Annex 7 which also shows the estimated generating costs of
a similar station, erected on the same site, designed to operate on Bunker
IC" fuel oil.  If the two sets of costs are compared it will be seen that in
1966 the cost per kwTh sent out by the station operating on fuel oil would be
28.6% higher, which fully justifies the installation of the gas pipeline even
for the initial station capacity of 100 ]IW. As the capacity of the pipeline
is sufficient to supply the ultimate capacity of the station, the existing
Port of Spain "A" station, and to meet estimated industrial demands for gas
in the Port of Spain area, the difference in generating cost will increase
in favor of gas as the through-put of the pipeline grows. The estimated
generating costs are based on the price of gas under the contract which has
recently been negotiated by T&TEC to meet its requirements from July 16, 1962
to December 31, 1973.
VI.  FUTURE 2XPANSION PROGRAM
50.       In addition to the increase in generating capacity and the expan-
sion of transmission and distribution facilities covered by the project,
provision has been made in the T&TEC forecast for the years 1961 through
1970 for the following items:

29.545         50.229
These costs do not include interest during construction.
VII. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Financial Structure
51.       The financial structure of the three electric supply entities is
s=unmarized below:
T&TEC
52.       On January 1, 1946, T-hen the TLTEEC commenced operations it assumed the
part of the capitalization of its predecessor, the Trinidad Electricity Board,
corresponding to assets actually taken over.  This capitalization consisted
exclusively of long-term Government loans.
53.       As T&TEC operated under the no--profit-no-loss provision of the
Electricity Ordinance of 1945 (anu.ndCd since), earned surplus has rcnaJinLd
relatively small asnd the caiitalizatibli is still alJnc-t entirely .in the form
of  oubt, as shown below:
Government bond issues
(net of sinking fund assets)   BWI$10.25 million
Government advances                   33.15    "
Earned surplus                         3.70    "
47.10



- 12 -
5h.       "Bond issues" represent the proceeds of public loans passed on by
the Goveri-ament to T&TEC or its ,redecessor betw^Teen 1945 and 1951. Thley
carry an interest oL 3% or 4p and are amortized on a sinking Lund basis
over a 30-year period.
55.       Government advances fall into t-wio categories.  Advances received
prior to IIarch 1956 have no terms of repayment but carry interest rates of
2%, 3-1/2% or 5%, according to the tranche (see para. 66). The bulk of the
advances (BDYI,22.65 million) was received by T&TEC after April 1956 t-o cover
t7-e cost of the Cornalission's expansion program in the last five years.  No
interest has been paid or accrued on this second group of advances peaMting
a final decision by -the Government as to their ulti:nate status.
The Port of Spain Corporation Electricity Board
56.       As of Decembler 31, 1960, Port of Spain's net fixed assets in
operation -Tere valued at BWI$4.07 million, and the total capitalization of
B3I$5.6 --illion was made up as follows:
Bond issues                  BWijl.l6 million
Government loans                 1.68
Government advances              0.32    "
Earned surplus                   2.48    "
Bond issues and Governmnent acdvances are si.milar in character to those of
T&TEC.  "Goverment loans", on the othier hand, h-ave no eauivalent in thie
capitalization of T&TEC. Thley represent 30-year loans from the Goverment
of Trinidad to the runicipality of Port of Spain for electric power distri-
bution.  The rate of interest they carry is 4$.
The San Fernando 3oroufflh Council
57.       Electricity accounts were not kept on a cormmercial basis and little
information is available. At the end of 1960, total assets were estimated
at BW1$0.4 million, with a capitalization consisting of long-term loans by
the Trinidad Government to the Borougfh Council and 30-year debentures issued
by the Cotucil to finance distribution facilities.
58.       Summaries of the balance sheets of the three entities are given
in Annex 8.
Rates and ?ecent Earnings
59.       The structure and level of retail rates of the Commission and of
Port of Spain are generally similar, but rates in San Fernando (a much
smaller operation) are sormewhat higher.
60..      In 1960 the avera-e revenue -per kwh frorm retail sales by Port of
Stain was about B7iJI 5.4 cents (US 32 r,iills). In San Fernando it was
BTW;I 7.4 cents (US 43 mills).  The low rate applied by T&TEC to bulk sales



- 13 -
to Port of Spain and San Fernando (EWI 2.7 cents equivalent to US 16 mills)
caused the average revenue per kwh from sales by T&TEC to be only BWI 4.4
cents (US 26 mills).
61.       Income statements of T&TEC and Port of Spain for the last three
years are summarized in Annex 9. Largely because of the rates applied to
bulk sales, earnings of T&TEC have been relatively low while those of Port
of Spain and San Fernando were substantially higher.  In 1960 the Commission
earned a return of about 5.3% on its net fixed assets in operation while
Port of Spain was earning a return of about 12%. No precise figures are
available for San Fernando.  The operating ratio of T&TEC improved somewhat
from 81% in 1958 to 76% in 1960. For Port of Spain, however, the trend was
opposite, from 79% in 1958 to 85% in 1960.
Merger Provisions
62.       On April 20, 1961 the assets and liabilities of Port of Spain and
San Fernando were officially transferred to T&TEC. As it is too early to
obtain a balance sheet of the new authority as of the date of the merger,
a summary consolidated balance sheet representing the situation as it would
have been as of the end of December 1960, is given in Annex 8, along with
the individual balance sheets of each of the three entities.
63.       Fixed assets in operation would have totalled 3HJII53.5 million
(US131.1 million) before deduction of a depreciation reserve of EVIv11.8
million.  In addition, work in progress was valued at BiII,5.8 million
(US`3.4 million).
64.       The consolidated capitalization may be summarized as follows:
Government bond issues                  WIAll.4l million
Government loans                             1.90    "
Government advances                         33.47    "
San Fernando City debentures                 0.20    "
Total                             46.98    "
Accumulated surplus                          6,19
Total Capitalization              53T1      "
The total debt/equity ratio would thus have been 88/12.
Future Status of Government Advances
65.       The Government has decided to regard the advances mlade to the
T&TEC as part of the pernanent capital of the Commission and treat such
advances as permanent subordinated debentures. This arrangement is satis-
factory.



- 14 -
66.       As far as actual payment of interest is concerned, a distinction
will remain between the two categories of advances:
(a)  Advances received by T&TEC before April 1956 wilL continue to
bear interest at the same rate as heretofore, i.e. 5% except
on two relatively small advances of BWI$1.5 million and BW0.5
million on which interest is 3-1/2% and 2% respectively.
(b) On advances received since April 1956, interest will begin to
accrue to Government starting on January 1, 1961 but will be
neither paid nor compounded until January 1, 1965. It will be
allowed to accumulate over this period and will then be acded to
the principal sums of the loans. At January 1, 1965, the gross
total of principal and interest thus accumulated will be converted
into perpetual subordinated debentures held by the Government and
paying interest at 5% per annum. These loans, together with ad-
vances mentioned in (a) above, will then form part of the peimanent
capital of the Conmmission.
Capital Expenditures and Sources of Funds
67.       T&TECts total capital requirements (including capitalization
interest) for new construction in the ten years 1961-70 are estimated at
BWIP117.2 million (equivalent to about US$69 million), with more than half
of the expenditures to be incurred in the years 1961 through 1965 for the
execution of the project.
68.       The following table gives a comparison between the Commissionts
requirements of funds and its estimated internal resources:
(in Millions of BWI$)
Total
1961-65       1966-70         1961-70
Construction costs                    70o,8          h6.4          117.2

B/A                                   40.2%          55.3%          45.8%
* Including sales of assets and consumers' contributions.
The Commission would thus meet about 46% of its capital needs over the
10-year period out of its own resources.



- 15 -
69.       Sources of funds for the capital expansion program would be as
follows, expressed in percentages:
Total
1961-65     1966-70      1961-70
T&TEC's own resources            40.2%        55.3%       45.8%
Government advances               6.4%          -          4.0%
Foreign borrowings               53.4%        44.7%       50.2%
100.0%      100.0%       100.0%
70.       Lon4-term borrowings during the period 1961 through 1965 vTould
consist of: (a) the proposed IBRD loan of BgL039.95 million (US'323.5 mil-
lion) for the project under construction, and (b) Government advances
totalling IWI,,4.8 million (USj2.8 million) for the completion of the Penal
and other minor projects. These advances will receive the same treatment
as those obtained by T&TEC from 1956 to 1960, and will be considered as
part of the Commission's permanent capital from 1965 on.
71.       A future foreign loan of &TIj20.4 million (US$12 million) has been
assumed in 1967 to cover the larger part of the foreign currency requirements
of the Port of Spain extension project.  A short-term Bank credit of B-TIU3.2
million, repayable in 24 months has also been assumed in 1962 to meet a temp-
orary shortage of working capital.
72.       The proposed financing program is reasonable.
Rates and Estimated Earnings
73.       The consolidation of the three entities will not result in major
changes in the retail rate structure. Only minor adjustments will be made
in the rates to small consumers.
74.       The present level of rates is expected to satisfy the requirements
of the amendment to the Electricity Ordinance which provides,inter alia,
that rates will be sufficient to cover operating expenses including depre-
ciation or amortization, whichever is the higher, and to accumulate a reason-
able surplus for reinvestment.
75.       As the wording of this clause is rather general the Bank, during
negotiations, obtained an assurance that a rate covenant which will require
the T&TEC to maintain rates at a satisfactory level will be accepted by the
Government and the T&TEC.
76.       The covenant will require the T&TEC to maintain a satisfactory
operating ratio which will be defined as not greater than 70%, calculated
on a three year moving average commencing January 1, 1962.
77.       A forecast of incame statements for the years 1961 to 1970 is given
in Annex 10 and a projection of cash flow statements for the same period is
attached as Annex 11. The estimates of revenues are based on growth of sales
discussed in Chapter IV. Average revenues per kwh sold are expected to remain
stable at about EWI 4.3 cents per kuh until 1966, and then drop slightly to
about aJI 3.9 cents by 1970.



- 16 -
78.       Depreciation lhas been assumed to remain on a straightline basis,
taking an average life of about 23 years for all power facilities, Twhich is
conservative. For purposes of calculation, the proposed 1BRD loan has been
assumed to bear interest at 5-3/A% per annum and have a term of 20 years
with amortization beginning early in 1966.  The second foreign loan to be
obtained in 1967 has been talcen to carry an interest rate of 6% and a term
of 20 years with a grace period of four years.
79.       If present rates are maintained, gross income is expected to rise
from BWI1.2.74 million in 1961 to BWI$7.66 million in 1970.  The operating
ratio would improve from the present 76% to about 70%,f by 1963, mostly because
of lower fuel costs resulting from the use of natural gas. The ratio would
then remain relatively stable at about 70% throughout the remainder of the
period under review.  Return on net fixed assets in operation would average
about 7% over the 10-year period.  The fluctuations from 5.3% to 9% will be
due to temporary conditions of imbalance between demand and installed ca-
pacity. The average return of 7% may be considered adequate, particularly
when it is remembered that T&TEC will be in a position to meet from its own
resources nearly half of its total expansion costs during the next 10 years.
80.       Total debt service coverage, inclu7ding interest on Govermnent
advances would average 2.0 over the 10-year period. Considering the capital-
ization of the entity this coverage is satisfactory. The coverage would be
2.8 on the average if Government advances were treated as equity rather than
debt.
81.       Projected balance sheets of T&TEC as at the end of each year from
1961 to 1970 are shown in Annex 12. Fixed assets in operation uould nearly
treble from 1960 to 1970, while total debt would increase 2.2 times.  Although
a debt/equity ratio is not very meaningful in this case since the status of
Government advances as debt or equity cannot be clearly determined, it is
interesting to note that if Government advances are considered as debt, the
ratio would improve 88/12 in 1960 to 79/21 in 1970 as a result of the pro-
gressive accumulation of earned surplus.
Auditing Procedures
82.       T&TEC's accounts are regularly audited by independent public
accountants. It has been agreed that this practice is satisfactory and
would be continued in the future.
VIII. JUSTIFICATION OF TIE PROJECT
83.        The project is needed to meet the growing demands for powTer in
Trinidad and Tobago.  The construction of the Port of Spain "3" power station
and of the natural gas pipeline is the most econaoical means of increasing
generating capacity to meet future system demands.  The capacity of the pipe-
line will be sufficient to supply both the Port of Spain "A" and "B" stations
and to meet estimated industrial demands for gas in the Port of Spain area
over the next 20 years.

IX. CONCLUSIONS
84,  (a)  The project is technically sound, the estimated cost is
reasonable, and construction schedules are realistic.
(b)  The project is necessary to meet the expected load growth
on the T&TEC system. There is no alternative method of
meeting these requirements which would compare favorably on
an economic basis.
(c)  The T&TEC is well managed and operated, its organization is
sound, and it is fully capable of constructing and operating
the project.
(d)  The Ordinance which governs the T&TEC1s operations, as now
amended, is satisfactory.
(e)  The present financial position of the T&TEC is sound.
(f)  The return on investment, based on the financial forecast,
is expected to average about 7% during the next 10 years.
This is adequate as the T&TEC should be able to cover 46%
of its capital requirements for expansion during this period
out of internal resources.
(g)  The Government's decision to regard advances made to the
T&TEC as part of the permanent capital of the Commission is
acceptable.
85.       During negotiations the Bank has obtained satisfactory assur-
ances that:
(i)  The T&TEC will continue to employ consultants satisfactory to
the Bank while the project is under construction and will em-
ploy contractors on the project which are satisfactory to the
Bank;
(ii) The T&TEC accounts will continue to be regularly audited
by independent public accountants, acceptable to the Bank;
(iii) A rate covenant which will insure adequate earnings in the
future by requiring the T&TEC to maintain an operating ratio
not greater than 70%, calculated on the basis of a three
ye&ar moving average commencing January 1, 1962, and a debt
lTnitation covenant, based on a debt/equity ratio of 60/40,
will be accepted;



- 18 -
(iv) The Government will give prior notice to the Bank of any
proposed changes in the T&TEC Ordinance and in T&TEC's
top management appointments in order that the Bank may
comment thereon;
(v)  The advances made, and to be made, by the Government to the
T&TEC will form part of the permanent capital of the Commis-
sion,
86.       The Government and the T&TEC have agreed that before the loan
is made effective the contract which T&TEC has negotiated with Shell
Trinidad Ltd. for the supply of natural gas to meet the requirements
of its Penal and Port of Spain "A" and "B" Power Stations from July 16,
1962 to December 31, 1973, will be signed.
87.       The project is considered suitable for a Bank loan of US$23.5
million equivalent, for a term of 20 years including a grace period of
4 years on amortization payments.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT          page 1
1.        The Port of Spain "B" thermal power station will be constructed on
a site in Port of Spain, the capital city and main load center, adjacent to an
existing thermal power station. The station will be designed for an ultimate
capacity of 220 MW, the maximum capacity which can be accommodated on the site.
Initially only 100 MI of plant will be installed but many features, such as the
cooling water system, will be designed and constructed for the ultimate
capacity.
2.        The station will be designed to operate on natural gas or Bunker "CI"
fuel oil. Normally it will operate on natural gas and a 16 inch diameter steel
pipeline, some 41 miles in length to bring gas from oil fields at Penal in
southern Trinidad will be constructed. The capacity of the pipeline will be
sufficient to supply the ultimate capacity of the new station, the existing
station, and possible industrial consumers in the Port of Spain area.
3.        The station is required to meet increasing demands on the T&TEC
system which are expected to exceed firm generating capacity in 1964. Before
deciding on the construction of the Port of Spain "B" station, the T&TEC asked
its consultants, Preece, Cardew & Rider, to investigate the possibilities of
extending the capacity of the existing station at Penal, which is very close
to an oil field producing natural gas. The consultants reported against ex-
tending the Penal station, as the cost of obtaining additional cooling water
suoplies would be very expensive, and recommended the Port of Spain "B"
station, designed for an ultimate capacity of 220 MW, and the gas pipeline
be constructed.
4.        The consultants also recommended that initially 2-50 >  sets be
installed, one to be in commission in 1964 and the other late in 1965, to meet
estimated system demands during the period 1964 to 1970. The consultants con-
sider 50 MW sets economically best suited to meet future load conditions, but
they point out as the largest existing unit in the system is 20 MW the system
firm generating capacity will only be increased by this amount when the first
50 NA set is installed and that a second 50 F14 set will therefore be required
within another two years as system demand is expected to grow at the rate of
about 10 YSW per annum in 1964 and 1965.
5.        The consultants recommendations, which were accepted by the T&TEC,
are acceptable to the Bank.
The Port of Spain "B" Thermal Power Station
6.        The station will be of the semi-outdoor type, with a steel framed
structure covered with a light weight insulated cladding to house the turbo-
alternator sets and control equipment. Sea water will be used for cooling
purposes and will be pumped to the station through reinforced concrete
culverts and returned through similar culverts for part of the way and then
through an open flume. The size of the culverts and flume will be sufficient
for the ultimate capacity of the station. A site plan of the station is
attached as Annex 6.
7.        The generating plant will consist of 2-50 M1  turbo-alternator sets
and two 475,o0o lb. per hour boilers.



ANNEX 4
page 2
8.        The turbines will be designed to operate with steam conditions of
900 lbs. per square inch and 9000F, and a vacuum of 27.9 inches Hg. Although
these steam conditions are fairly low by modern standards they are the most
economical in this instance because of the low cost of natural gas as fuel.
Any gain in operating efficiency and consequent savings in operating costs
which would be obtained by using high pressures and temperatures would be
more than offset by the increased capital cost of generating plant. Each
turbine will be directly coupled to a 50 Nl 3-phase 11 kv, 0.8 p.f., 60 cycle
alternator.
9.        The boilers will be designed to operate with super heater outlet
steam conditions of 925 lbs. per square inch and 9250F. Each boiler will be
a self-contained unit with economizer, regenerative type air preheater, single
forced draft and induced draft fans and a self-supporting chimney. Provision
will be made for full duty oil firing as a safeguard against failure of the
gas supply. The existing Port of Spain "A" station fuel oil storage tanks
will be connected to the new station for standby purposes. The boilers will
be of the outdoor type but canopies will be provided to cover the firing
aisles and the control cubicles. Feed heating, de-aerating and water treatmentv
plant, together with three full duty motor driven feed pumps will be installed,
the third pump serving as a standby unit.
10.       The output of the station will be stepped up from 11 kv to 33 kv
by two 62.5 M1VA water cooled transformers, and fed into the T&TEC transmission
system via an existing 33 kv switchyard adjacent to the Port of Spain "A"
station. All switching will be carried out at 33 kv by 1500 INVA oil circuit
breakers.
The Natural Gas Pipeline
11.       The estimated quantity of gas which will be required over the next
20 years in the Port of Spain area is summarized as follows:
Natural Gas Requirements 1961-$8
Port of Spain                                    Port of Spain         Total
"A" & "B"       Industrial        Total        "A" & "B" Stations    Maximum
Stations       Requirements   Requirements  Maximum rate per hr. Rate per hr-
(Millions of cubic feet)
122,680       70,500           193,180              2.1              3.3
12.       The industrial requirements have been estimated on the assumption
that all existing users of fuel oil would change over to natural gas and that
demand would grow at the rate of 8% per annum, about the same rate of increase
expected for electric power sales over the next 20 years.
13.       The maximum rate per hour of gas through the pipeline determines its
size. The maximum rate, based on estimated daily load curves of the station



ANNEX 4
page 3
and estimated industrial demands has been calculated at 2.1 million cubic
feet per hour for the two stations and 3.3 million cubic feet per hour for the
total supply.
14.       The oil companies have informed the T&TEC that gas will be supplied
at Penal at 300 lbs. per square inch. Allowing for a drop in pressure of
25 lbs. per square inch in the metering equipment, the pressure at the inlet
to the pipeline would be 275 lbs. per square inch. To afford an adequate
pressure at the boiler burners the minimum allowable pressure at the power
station end of the pipeline has been calculated at 50 lbs. per square inch.
Under these conditions a 16 inch diameter pipeline will deliver about 2.1
million cubic feet per hour, which should be sufficient to meet the require-
ments of both the Port of Spain "A" and "B" stations over the next 20 years.
15.       To meet industrial requirements as well as the requirements of the
two stations the gas pressure would have to be boosted. Provision will be
made for such equipment to be fitted as and when required. If demand for gas
for industrial purposes increases as estimated boosting equipment will be
required in 1974, when the combined maximum hourly requirement is expected
to exceed 2,1 million cubic feet per hour.
The Expansion of Transmission and Distribution Systems
16.       The existing transmission and distribution systems of the T&TEC
will be reinforced to take care of increasing loads and will also be extended
to supply new areas. About 62 miles of 66 kv transmission line and 73 miles of
33 lkv primary distribution line will be erected and about 6-miles of 33 kv
underground cable will be installed. Substation capacity will be increased,
and a new system control center near Port of Spain will be constructed. Ad-
ditional secondary distribution lines and services will be installed, and
the distribution system previously operated by the Port of Spain Corporation
and San Fernando Borough Council will be reconstructed to operate at 6.6 kv
instead of 2.3 kv as this voltage is too low to cope with increasing loads.
