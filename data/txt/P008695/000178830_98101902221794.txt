INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE INVESTMENT BANK, ROMANIA, WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF TEE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF ROMANIA
FOR THE TURCENI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendaticou an a proposed
loain to the Investment Bank, Romania, with the guarantee of the Socialist
Republic of Ronmania for the equivalent of US$60 million to help finance
the foreign exchange cost of a thermal power project. The loan would have
a term of 25 years, including 5-1/2 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4
percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        Romania joined the Bank on December 15, 1972. The first economic
mission visited the country in March/April 1973 and its report, entitled
"The Economy of Romania" (R73-274), was issued to the Executive Directors on
November 30, 1973. An updating mission just returned from Romania and will
complete its report later this year. The first basic mission is scheduled
for 1976. Social and economic country data are given in Annex I.
3.        Since the founding of the People's Republic of Romania in 1948,
which in 1965 was reconstituted as the Socialist Republic of Romania, eco-
nomic management has been organized along socialist principles which have
included state and cooperative ownership of almost all productive resources,
and the absence of private enterprise. Economic activity is directed by means
of administrative development planning, coordinated by the central authorities.
Productive enterprises operate within the framework of the development plan
which defines the scope of their activity, the outlines of their production
and investment goals and their targets for operating efficiency. The Plan is
elaborated within a five-year time frame, each year having a separate Annual
Plan. The country is presently in the fourth year of its Five-Year Plan for
the period 1971-1975.
4.        The technical and functional Ministries are the State's chief agents
for the administration of economic activity. They are assisted by subordinate
units known as Centrals, which coordinate and supervise activities within a
conmnon branch or industry without being directly engaged in production. Sub-
ordinate to the Centrals are the productive enterprises whose principal task
is meeting production targets. Production enterprises generally are not au-
thorized to engage directly in foreign trade. For this purpose they use spe-
cial foreign trade enterprises.



-2-
5.        Economic development is of paramouit concern to the Romanian Govern-
ment. Rapid industrialization is a major objective with priority being given
to heavy industry including steel, machine tools and chemicals. To achieve
their growth objectives the Romanian authorities have made considerable ef-
forts to mobilize domestic resources for development and to maintain a high
rate of capital formation. In the present Five-Year Plan planned and actual
investment rates of around 30 percent of GN1 have been the norm. As a con-
_uq"nce, consum.pcion has been restrained, and the development of the consumer
goods industry has been less strongly emphasized than that of heavy industry.
In 1972, heavy industry (led by machine tools, chemicals and ferrous metal-
lurgy) accounted for about 70 percent of industrial production.
6.        As a result of this strategy, a marked change has been achieved
in the structure of Romania's economy. Rapid industrial growth, which over
the last decade has averaged more than 13 percent per annum, has expanded
the share of the labor force employed in industry including power and con-
struction to 35 percent in 1972, from about 14 percent in 1950. During the
same period, agricultural output almost tripled while the share of the labor
force engaged in agriculture declined from 74 percent to around 42 percent.
7.        Romania's population growth is around 1.0 percent per annum.     Thus,
the impact of rapid economic growth on per capita incomes has not been sub-
stantially diluted by the population increase. In the last decade, GNP growth
has been 9.0 percent per annum on average, implying a growth of about 8.0 per-
cent per annum of per capita GNP. The latest World Bank Atlas estimates GNP
per capita for 1971 at $740.
8.        The organization of production in both the urban sector and in agri-
culture is such that all labor is actively employed and there is no open un-
employment. There is, however9 some labor surplus. Income distribution is
also relatively equal. In 1972, average monthly wages were 1,498 lel (about
$75 equivalent). Almost 80 percent of all monthly wages were within the range
of 900-20^00 lei and less than 6 percent were under 900 lei. Minimum wages
are guaranteed by the State; they were raised to 1,000 lei per month for
full-time workers in September 1972. Prices for essential consumer goods
and services such as basic foodstuffs, rents and urban transport are rela-
tively low and most social services, notably education and health care, are
provided without charge. Continuous efforts are made to increase the standard
of living. Romania also pursues a positive regional policy which has sought
to bring a balanced development of both human and natural resources to all
parts of the country.
9.        The official exchange rate of lei 4.97 per US$1.00 is used only
for accounting purposes. The rate used for invisible and capital transactions
is lei 14.38 per US$1. Under a new system introduced in January, 1974, the
prices of all traded goods are converted at a uniform rate of lei 20 per
US$1.00, a rate which is considered by the Romanians as being representative
of the cost of convertible foreign exchange. For imported goods, the domestic
lei price is found by adding to the converted foreign price a tariff rate
which varies for different types of goods. The rate of lei 20 per US$1.00



has also been used to convert national income statistics from lei to     sII; ,.
Consequently, this rate has been used as the base rate for calculaticns in
the appraisal.
Recent Developments
10.       Since the National Part:y Conference of 1967, w'nich set the stage
for major qualitative advances in Romania's economic and social development,
there have been important new emphases in Romania's economic management.
Measures were taken to improve the institutional basis of planning (e.,. by
creating the Centrals to assist in plan administration), to increase toe ef-
ficiency of economic management and to improve upon the quality of production
in industry. In agriculture efforts were made to raise productivity and
stabilize growth through irrigation, mechanization and the expanded use of
chemical fertilizers, To expand upon the growth of foreign trade and technical-
economic cooperation the Romanian Government has concluded trade and cooperation
agreements with a wide range of countries. In this context also, Romania has
made positive efforts to expand its multilateral external relations and to
pursue full cooperation with the international agencies, including UN, UNCTAD,
UNESCO, FAO, UNIDO and GATT.
11.       One result of these efforts is that foreign trade has expanded quite
rapidly in recent years both in volume and in regional diversity. There has
also been a tendency to move away from trade on a bilateral barter basis to-
wards trade involving multilateral payments. During the period 1965-72,
total foreign trade grew at about 12 percent per annum in current prices.
In 1972, imports and exports each totalled about $2.6 billion, about 45 per-
cent of which represented trade with non-socialist countries. Overall trade
deficits have generally remained small.    During 1968-72 the total annual trade
deficit averaged about $75 million, i.e. less than 8 percent of average ex-
ports. However, the results varied as between different trade regions. Im-
ports from East European Socialist countries were slightly lower than Romania's
exports to that region. In Romania's trade with Western industrialized coun-
tries, on the other hand, exports were much less than imports. These deficits
have sometimes been increased by deficits on the invisibles account with
Western countries.
12.       The Romanian economy has not escaped the impact of recent world
developments affecting the energy sector, even though the country depends
only marginally on imported fuels. At present Romania is a net importer of
crude oil and a net exporter of petroleum derivatives. In 1973 Romania im-
ported about 4.0 million tons of crude oil valued at around $80 million,
out of a total crude consumption of around 17 million tons. Valued at 1974
prices, this volume of imports will cost over $200 million which represents
a significant increase in required foreign exchange. These imports, however,
are used mainly as chemical feedstock. Exports of derivatives in 1973 were
about 5.0 million tons valued at about $140 million. To the extent petroleum
derivative prices rise in response to recent changes in crude oil prices,
there will be gains in export earnings to offset the rise in the oil import
bill.  The extent to which this will occur, however, is still uncertain.      In



- 4 -
November 1973, the Romanians embarked on a stringent program of economy ia
the use of fuels, which included rationing of gasoline and fuel oil, in order
both to minimize the import drain and maximize the supply available for ex-
port; rationing ended in March 1974 following an increase in the selling
prices of these fuels.
Exter.Lal Assistance
13.       The expansion of Romania's trade with the non-socialist industrial
countries has led to an increased need zo obtain convertible currencies to
pay for imports from those countries. Fomania has met this need both by bor-
rowing abroad and by mounting a major effort to expand exports and tourism.
Gross inflows of convertible currency capital were US$542 million in 1973,
having grown from US$276 million in 1967. Romania's access to convertible
finance, however, has been almost exclusively confined to financial and sup-
pliers' credits with relatively short repayment periods. The net inflow of
convertible capital in 1973, therefore, was only US$238 million.
14.       As part of its effort to expand its foreign trade and cooperation
relationships, Romania has also taken active steps to attract long-term pri-
vate capital. A regulation passed in 1972 defines the conditions under which
foreign firms can establish joint ventures with domestic enterprises, prefer-
ably in foreign exchange earning/saving industries. Romania has also estab-
lished two joint banks, one in France and the other in the United Kingdom,
in an effort to expand the availability of credit from European countries.
Prospects
15.       The current Five-Year Plan (1971-75), whose original targets in
most sectors appear likely to be exceeded, reflects Romania's continued
strategy of rapid growth. The targets contained in the Annual Plan for 1974,
for example, include a 16.7 percent growth in industrial production, 14.6
percent growth in national income, an investment rate equal to 35 percent of
national income and a 41 percent expansion of foreign trade. The Plan also
lays stress on a range of qualitative aspects of development including tech-
nical improvements and diversification in industry and foreign trade, improve-
ments in capacity utilization, development of the nation's human resource
potential and a continued emphasis on regional development.
16.       Romania has good potential for further economic growth.    Endowed
with important natural resources - fuels, some minerals, timber, rich soils
and a favorable climate both for agriculture and tourism - and located con-
veniently with respect to its major international markets in the East and
West, the country has built a broad industrial infrastructure (power, metal-
lurgy, chemicals) which will serve as a base for the expansion of secondary
manufacturing sectors such as machine building and consumer durables. Above
all, Romania has a hard-working and increasingly skilled population devoted
to the achievement of the country's development objectives.
17.       Economic growth and structural change call for the introduction of
new industrial technologies, improvements in the quality of products, more
economic use of materials and factor inputs, and reductions in production



costs. The increasing diversity and complexity of Romania's economic s.z-c-
ture require continuing improvements in the efficiency of economic planning
and coordination and further refinements in industrial management.  7T
up with these changes and requirements large programs of education and manpower
training have been mounted, and efforts are being made to strengthen technical
cooperation with industrialized countries and international organizations.
Creditworthiness
18.       At the end of 1973 Romania's total medium and long-term external
debt amounted to $1,519 million. Most of these debts ($1,404 million) were
denominated in convertible currencies, the major creditor countries being
Germany, France, UK and Italy. While the total debt does not appear excessive
in relation to the volume and growth of external trade, average maturities are
relatively short and convertible debt service payments are estimated to be in
the order of $340 million a year during 1974-75. The convertible debt service
ratio was approximately 19 percent in 1973, reflecting the unfavorable terms
of foreign credits available to the country.
19.       The organization of economic activity in Romania and the pursuit
of a development strategy involving high investment/saving rates and rapid
income growth ensure the availability of domestic resources sufficient to
service reasonable amounts of foreign debt. Moreover, the country's major
efforts to expand exports (particularly to convertible currency areas), to
attra(t private joint venture capital and to seek other forms of bilateral
convertible currency financing are increasing the foreign exchange available
for debt service. Convertible earnings rose from $585 million in 1967 to
$1,902 million in 1973. The preferential trade status accorded to Romania
by the EEC in June 1973 should facilitate the further expansion of such
exports as could the granting of most favored nation status by the U.S.
Last year, the Government also restricted the use of short-term credit faci-
lities from western suppliers in an effort to improve the structure of the
country's external debt. Assuming a continuation of present export and debt
management policies it can be expected that the debt service ratio will
gradually decline during the second half of the 1970's. The country's pre-
sent outward-looking posture, the success of both its domestic growth and
foreign trade policies, and its potential for continued development, all
support the judgment that Romania is creditworthy for substantial Bank
lending.
20.       When Romania joined the Bank, most pre-war foreign debts of the
country had been settled. The only settlements which were still under dis-
cussion at that time concerned claims in the United Kingdom and in the United
States. The Romanian authorities have repeatedly assured the Bank of their
intention to settle these old claims, and have from time to time advised the
Bank staff of progress towards settlement. As far as the US claims are con-
cerned, there have been several meetings between both parties. The most re-
cent meetings between a Romanian delegation led by the l)eputy Minister of
Finance and representatives of the US bondholders took place on June 10, 1t
and 20 in Washington; the next meeting is planned for early July during which
botlh sides expect to agree on procedures for formal registration and validation



- 6 -
of Dutstanding bonds. Tlhe Romanian authorities have expressed confidence that
_.a< azreenent on a compensation formula will be completed no later tilan
-. ous-c 1974.  The UK claims are larger and more complicated.  The most recent
-:eetings were hield in London on June 6 and in Bucharest on June 18.  Both
sides aim to exchange specific proposals during the next few weeks, and the
komanian authorities have expressed confidence that final agreement will be
reached By September.
PART II - BANK GRO'JP OPERATIONS IN ROMANIA
21.       Documents for the first loan to Romania, the Tecuci Fertilizer Proj-
ect, were distributed recently to the Executive Directors. In addition to the
proposed project, documents are also now being distributed for the proposed
Otelinox Special Steel Project.
22.       It will take time to build up a detailed knowledge of the economy
whlch would allow a sharper focus on the outstanding development problems.
At present, foreign exchange, especially in convertible currencies, appears
to be a major constraint. During the early phase in the Bank's relations
with Romania, therefore, one of the major objectives of Bank lending will be
to help alleviate the country's shortage of foreign exchange by providing
long-term external capital and by financing projects which would expand for-
eign exchange earnings or savings. Bank lending will also aim at supporting
the Government's efforts to introduce new industrial technologies, to improve
the quality of products, to make more economic use of materials and factor
inputs and to reduce production costs. In the power sector the Bank supports
the Government's program of primary energy resource development and use, and
the proposed project which will utilize the country's extensive lignite d>-
posits, fits this objective well. Market aspects and marketing, especially
for export goods, will also be emphasized. Special attention is also being
given to agriculture where productivity levels are still relatively low.
The Government is aware of this situation and has stepped up efforts to deve-
lop agricultural sector as evidenced by the rapid expansion of irrigation,
the increasing use of fertilizer and the continuing pursuit of institutional
improvements in this sector. The Bank will assist the Government in implement-
ing plans in this field.
23.       In furtherance of these objectives of Bank lending, loans for an
irrigation project in the area of Giurgiu-Razmiresti and an agricultural credit
operation to develop agricultural production within the recently completed
Sadova-Corabia irrigation system are envisaged within the next year. Also
being prepared for Bank consideration is a multi-purpose power and irrigation
project on the lower Olt River and a pulp and paper project.
24.       In addition to significant help with the preparation of projects for
Bank financing, the Bank (through the EDI) has supported a project appraisal
training course for Romanian officials (held in Belgrade in October 1973).
The preparation for a series of similar courses in Romania are underway.



- 7 -
25.       Romania is not yet a member of IFC but preliminary contacts have
been made to discuss Romania's cooperation with IFC.
26.       The projects in the pipeline would represent only a small proportion
of Romania's total need for external financing, and of its total disbursed
convertible debt. However, they would provide a substantial net addition
to the present inflow of convertible currency finance, and hopefully set a
Dattern for obtaining finance on longer repayment terms. The disbursed debt
outstanding to the Bank is not expected to constitute more than 10 percent of
Romania's total projected convertible currency debt in FY79; the Bank's share
of Romania's debt service payments in FY79 would be less than 4 percent.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR IN ROMANIA
Energy Resources
27.       Romania relies predominantly on domestic sources of primary energy,
though in recent years imports of crude oil and coal have become important.
The country's single most important source of primary energy is natural gas,
accounting for 41 percent of total consumption in 1973. Of the balance, oil
accounted for about 30 percent, coke and coal for about 28 percent and hydro-
electricity for about 1 percent.
28.       Total gas production in 1973 was 30 billion m3, of which 5 billion
m3 was derived from oil. It is expected that production will increase by about
1 billion m3 annually until 1975 with no increase thereafter. Known reserves
are expected to provide 30-50 years supply of natural gas at these extraction
rates.  As for crude oil,. Romania consumed or processed about 17 million tons
in 1973 of which 13 million tons was from domestic reserves. Domestic crude
is generally of very high quality with less than 1.0 percent sulphur content.
Of the country's coal reserves about 90 percent consists of relatively low
grade lignite (with a combustible content between 35 and 38 percent). Of
a total reserve of around 9 billion tons, most of which is in the Oltenia
region, about 3 billion is considered economically exploitable.
29.       The Government's energy policy aims at diverting Romania's limited
gas reserves increasingly towards the use as feedstock for chemical industries,
and basing additional power generation on less valuable domestic raw materials
such as lignite and hydro resources. This not only increases the value added
obtained from gas, but saves scarce foreign exchange for imports of fuel oil
whiclh would othierwise be necessary, and lessens the risk of disruptions in
raw material supplies. The proposed project exemplifies this policy.
Electrical Energy
30.       The installed generating plant at the end of 1972 was 9,357 MW
(delivering 43,400 GWh) of which 9,100 MW or 97.3 percent was interconnected.
The plant comprised 6,842 MW steam, 2,100 MW hydro, 306 .4W diesel and 109 MWi
as gas-turbine. Of the total 8,501 MW was in the charge of the Ministry of



-8-
Electrical Energy whilst the remainder represented plant installed at indus-
trial works. The transmission system comprised 242,675 km of lines at all
voltages of which 2,010 km at 400 kV, 2,458 km at 220 kV, and 9,259 km at
110 kV. Sub-transmission/distribution in the range of 1-60 kV accounted for
86,489 km of lines with the remaining 142,459 km being at less than 1 kV (see
attached map).
31.       hydroelectricity:   In the years 1960-72, thie total hydro-based ca-
pacity increased exactly tenfold (i.e. from 210 MW to 2,100 MW), Most of this
inicrease, however, came in 1970/71 upon tlle completion of the Iron Gates I
hydro-electric station on the Datube. This station has a total capacity of
2,100 MN and produces about 11,OCO GWh p.a. Only half of these amounts are
available to the Romanian system as the Iron Gates output is shared equally
with Yugoslavia. It is estimated that Romania's total hydro-potential (eco-
nomically feasible) is around 31,000 GWh p.a. of which only 7,000 GWh p.a.
is developed at present.
32.       Thermal Power:   In 1972, the output of 36,000 GWh from the thermal
plant was derived from the following fuels: gas 59.1 percent, lignite 20.8
percent, coal 13.4 percent, fuel oils 3.8 percent and other fuels including
secondary resources, 2.9 percent. The largest operating steam units are 315
MW at Craiova and are lignite-fired. Further units of similar size and type
(330 MW) are under construction at Rovinari. Craiova and Rovinari are in the
Oltenia region not far from Turceni. Twelve 200-MW units have been commis-
sioned in the period 1966 to 1972. Romania has until recent years purchased
its major power plant components from foreign sources, mainly Russia and
Czechoslovakia.
33.       Nuclear Energy:   There is at present no nuclear power generating
capacity in Romania but there are plans to develop a 440-MW plant with the
commissionning scheduled for 1981.
The Market for Electric Power
34.       Electricity supply is available to 91 percent or 18.7 million of
the Romanian people. Average annual consumption of electricity per capita
was about 1,600 kWh in 1972. Total energy consumption within the country
was divided as follows: industry 75 percent, commerce 11 percent, domestic
9 percent, and agriculture 5 percent. Of the country's total electricity
production of 43,440 GWh, about 8.5 percent was exported, principally to
Czechoslovakia via USSR.
35.       Village Electrification:   Romania presently has some 13,150 vil-
lages. In 1960, 3,427 of these had been electrified. In the next five
years (1961-65), 617 villages were electrified on average each year. In
1966-70 the rate increased to 815 p.a. Thereafter, as the remainder became
increasingly remote the rate dropped to slightly more than 500 per year.
By 1972, 88.5 percent had been electrified and the balance is to be completed
by 1975 at the rate of 500 per year, at which tIme electricity will be avail-
able to nearly the entire population.



-9
Development Program
36.       The Government attaches high priovity to the development of the
electric power sector because it considers the development of this sector as
an essential element of, and prerequisite for, the development of Romania
as a whole. State Plans in the past have included investment projects which
substantially increased the production capacity of the power sector. Also,
for the period up to at least 1980 further substantial capacity increases
are envisaged in order to make the most ecoaomical use of the existing power
resources of the country. Total investmenti to support the planned growth in
the power sector over the years 1974-80 amomnt to lei 99.3 million (US$5 bil-
lion equivalent). Of this, some 60 percent will be for new generating plant.
This reflects an average system investment rate of 12,000 lei/kW plant in-
stalled including tr,ansmission and distribution works, etc.
37.       In the development program, hydro development will be accelerated
as far as possible. Specifically the Riu Mare scheme with 320 MW of plant
at 14,000 lei/kW investment is scheduled for construction during 1974 to
1980. The Cernavoda scheme on the Danube costing 20,000 lei/kW with 1,000
MW of plant and an annual output of 4,000 GWh is planned for construction
during 1975 to 1983.
38.       Thermal development will concentrate on the utilization of indi-
genous solid fuel and the proposed project is typical, being sited so as to
permit its extension by a further 1,320 MW of plant based on lignite fuel.
Recognizing the inevitable exhaustion of solid fuel resources, development of
nuclear plant is also planned, as described above. An important factor in
the future thermial program is the planned retirement of old and relatively
inefficient plant to be made possible by the construction of more efficient
and modern units such as Turceni. Even neglecting any plant retirement as-
pects, Turceni's contribution to the system peak demand will be absorbed in
less than 14 months after commissioning; its installed capacity is about one-
third of the total new plant being commissioned in the construction period.
39.       While in making development plans for the power sector, the devel-
opment needs and financial resources of the whole economy are taken into con-
sideration, it is the Government's policy to ensure that a substantial part
of the investments in the sector are financed from funds which are generated
in the sector itself. Thus, in the period 1974 to 1980 it i8 planned that
more than 40 percent of the investments in the sector will be financed from
funds generated by power sector enterprises. Consequently, it is also the
Government's policy to set the prices in the power sector at a level sufficient
to cover operating and administration expenses (including maintenance, depre-
ciation and taxes, if any) and to produce substantial benefits. lr a letter
supplemental to the Loan and Guarantee Agreements the Guarantor would confirm
that these principles are applied whenever decisions for specific investment
projects in the power sector are taken, and that the exchange of views and in-
formation as agreed upon between the Guarantor, the Borrower and the Bank,
would provide adequate opportunities for further reviews of the application
of the principles to the actual investment and financing plans for the electric
power sector.



Organization of the Sector
40.       The Ministry of Electrical Energy (MEE) administers the sector
through a board comprising the minister, three deputy ministers and the various
directors of subordinate units. Power production, transmission and distribution
facilities are operated by enterprises of which there are 16 for generation
and 17 for distribution, all of which are subordinated to the Industrial Cen-
tral for Electric Power and Heat (CIEET). The Central serves as an interme-
diary between the Ministry and the enterprises, collating and monitoring their
investment and production plans, supervising their activities and reviewing
their finances.
41.       The Design Institute for Thermal Studies (ISPE) which is subordinate
to the Ministry is responsible for project design. There are also foreign
trade enterprises dealing with the sector which serve as agents in the pro-
curement of equipment from abroad.
42.       The Turceni generation enterprise was established on August 1, 1973
by a decree of the Council of Ministers. It is a legal entity, whose desig-
nated officers have the power to sign contracts and utilize the investment
funds provided for the project. It is a self-accounting unit, recording the
costs of construction and subsequently those of production when the power
station is commissioned. Its function during the construction and operation
phase of the project are described in more detail in paras 49.and 50 below.
The Borrower
43.       The borrower for the proposed loan would be the Investment Bank,
which is the specialized agency, under the Ministry of Finance, for investment
projects in all sectors of the economy except agriculture (including water
resources) and food processing. It has a large technical and economic staff
with branch offices in all districts of the country. The Investment Bank's
involvement in investment projects commences in the preparation phase of a
project; its staff appraises all major investment projects technically and
financially and recommends approval or otherwise of their financing to the
Council of Ministers. When a particular project and its financial plan has
been approved by the Council of Ministers, all major funds (budget allocations,
depreciation funds, share of planned benefits) are channeled through the
Investment Bank in accordance with the approved financial plan. All payments
in lei for the execution of a project have to be authorized by the Investment
Bank which keeps separate accounts for each category in the firancial plan
for every enterprise. It is the bank's obligation to ensure that a project
is executed according to the financial and technical data included in the
final technical and economic study as approved by the Council of Ministers.
Its inspectors check whether the project is proceeding according to the
schedule approved in the Plan.
44.       While the Investment Bank's supervision and control function is
thus rather strong during the implementation phase of a project, its func-
tions are much more limited during the operation pliase of a project. Al-
though it has the right and obligation to verify that the enterprise is



meeting the targets set in the investment plan, it has no legal authoricy
to influence directly the management of the enterprise or to force the en-
terprise directly to take operational actions which it considers necessary.
In practice, however, it can request such actions very effectively by re-
porting through the Ministry of Finance to the Government. To ensure that
the Turceni Enterprise meet the requirements specified in the loan agreement
concerning the operations phass, the Guarantor shall cause the enterprise to
comply with such requirements (see Section 2.03 of the Guarantee Agreement).
45.       As mentioned above, the Investment Bank is the channel for all
sources of major domestic investmenit financing, but its own funds are still
relatively small. Its prime source of funds is the State Budget. The
Guarantee Agreement, therefore, includes a provision (Section 2.02) that the
Guarantor shall provide all necessary funds for the implementation and ope-
ration of the project. The Guarantor would also provide sufficient funds to
the Investment Bank to ensure that it can meet the debt service on the Bank
loan (see para 53 below). In view of the status of the Investment Bank with-
in the government system, it is considered sufficient to rely in this respect
on the Guarantee Agreement (Section 2.01).
PART LV - THE PROJECT
46.       The project was identified in mid-1973 and appraised in November
1973 on the basis of technical and economic data submitted by the Government.
Negotiations were held in April/Yiy 1974 in Washington. The Romanian delega-
tion which included representatives of the Government and the Turceni Enter-
prise was led by Mr. Mihai Diamandopol, President of the Investment Bank.
Approval by the Council of Ministers of the main indicators of the technical
and economic study for the project would be a condition of effectiveness of
the loan.
Project Description
47.       The Turceni power plant, which will be constructed under the pro-
posed loan, will be among the largest of the lignite-fuelled plants in Romania,
comparable to the existing plants at Craiova and Rovinari. Its detailed analy-
sis as well as the initiation of construction is included in the Romanian
1971-75 Plan. The Project's completion and attainment of full capacity will
be part of the 1976-80 Plan. The project will include the construction of:
(a)  a thermal power station with four 330-MW lignite-fired units
delivering 7,920 GWh to the interconnected system at a load
factor of 74 percent, complete with the Jiu river realignment
for cooling water intake purposes and flood control, road and
rail links for construction and generation purposes;
(b) 400-kV and 110-kV transmission lines, about 600-km long, con-
necting Turceni with Mintia and Brazi substations including



- 12 -
a switching station and interconnection with the existing
400-kV system out of Iron Gates I power station. The 110-
kV line is for construction and standby purposes and will
connect with two nearby substations.
48.       The development of lignite supply as fuel for the Turceni plant,
although not part of the project, was also examined during appraisal. The
fuel will be supplied from the Oltenia deposits from two new mines, one an
open cast mine at South Jilt and the other an underground mine at Matasari,
supplemented by some expansion of existing mines in the Oltenia region. A
Loan and Project Summary is given in Annex III. The Appraisal Report en-
titlea "Appraisal of the Turceni Thermal Power Project" is being distributed
separately to the Executive Directors.
Project Execution
49.       Responsibilities for project execution have been delegated to
several agencies of the Ministry of Electrical Energy but the Turceni Enter-
prise will have overall responsibility for the coordination of project execu-
tion and of the project related activities of the other agencies involved
(see Section 3.01 of the Loan Agreement). The Design Institute for Thermal
Studies (ISPE) and the Design Institute for Studies and Projects for Power
Station Equipment (ICPET) are responsible for basic design and engineering
and the technical aspects of bid s;pecification and evaluation. They will
also supervise the construction of civil, electrical and mechanical works.
Civil works will be undertaken by the Thermal Construction Trust (TEC) and
the electrical and mechanical works in the power station by the Electro~-
Mechanical Construction Trust (TENM). The transmission, distribution and
substation works will be undertaken by the Transmission and Substation
Construction Trust (TEM). The procurement of foreign equipment and materials
needed for the project will be the responsibility of the foreign trade enter-
prise ROMENERGO. Goods and services required for the project and to be sup-
plied from within Romania will be procured directly by the Turceni Enterprise
with the guidance of the design iuistitutes ISPE and ICPET who would assist
the enterprise in a manner similar to a consultant. At the same time, the
Investment Bank has a team of specialists who effect a technical and admin-
istrative audit during the investment period.
Project Operation
50.       The Turceni power plant will be operated by the Turceni Enterprise
within the Industrial Central for Electrical Power and Heat. The organiza-
tion and functioning of Turceni is in accordance with the 1971 law on the
organization of State production and administration units. This law pro-
vides for a general manager of the enterprise (appointed by the Ministry
of Electrical Energy) who, assisted by a management committee, decides on and
supervises the daily operations of the enterprise. Under the Romanian system
of collective decision-making the organization of the enterprise also includes
an Assembly of the Working People in the enterprise, which meets twice yearly
to determine matters of broad policy interest and a Committee of Working People



- 13 -
(formed from the Assembly) which determines operating policies at monthly meet-
ings. All decisions of these bodies must be made within the framework of t6hC
Plan.
Project Cost
51.       The total cost of the project (excluding interest during construc-
tion) is equivalent to US$353.5 million with a direct foreign exchange compo-
nent of US$89.3 million, or 25.3 percent of the total. The project cost in-
cludes the cost of the transmission lines and other associated works (e.g.
switching station, construction rail link, compensation for the use of agri-
cultural land) totalling about $60 million. Local costs are based on fixed
Romanian prices and are unlikely to change significantly; however, an allow-
ance not exceeding 5 percent is built into the base costs of local project
components in accordance with Romanian practice. Price contingencies on
items to be financed by the Bank Loan were calculated at 14 percent for 1974,
11 percent for 1975 and 7-1/2 percent for subsequent years; for the remainder
of direct imports a price contingency of 5 percent is provided. Physical
contingency has been allowed at 5 percent on the overall cost of the project
which is in accordance with Romanian experience.
Financing
52.       The proposed Bank loan of US$60 million would be sufficient to fi-
nance about 67 percent of the direct foreign exchange cost of the project.
Interest on the Bank loan during construction (amounting to about US$14 mil-
lion) and the remaining foreign cost would be provided by the State. ('How-
ever, an understanding has been reached that any undisbursed loan portion
as a result of cost savings would be used to finance part of interest during
construction on the Bank loan). For the sector as a whole, the investment
program of the Industrial Central over the period 1974-79 requires about lei
87 billion (about US$4.4 billion equivalent), of which 46 percent will be
financed from internal cash generation and 54 percent from external sources.
Of the latter about 52 percent will be from the State Budget, about 1 percent
from Investment Bank loan and &bout 1 percent from the proposed Bank loan.
Lending Terms
53.       The proposed loan to the Investment Bank would be guaranteed by the
Coveranmenit and would be for a term'of 25 years including 5-1/2 years of grace
a t anl initerest rate of 7.25 percent per annum. In accordance with the finan-
cinlg meclhanism for projects in Romania, which is described in detail in para-
graphs 3.14 to 3.19 of the Appraisal Report, the Investment Bank would not
actually relend the Bank loan to thie enterprise. liowever, the enterprise
would be the beneficiary of the Bank loan and its annual transfer of funds
to the State Budget and Investment Bank would be sufficient to cover the lei
equivalent of the debt service on the Bank loan (Section 4.01 (h) of the
Loan Agreement).



- 14 -
Audit
514.      Romania has a well developed system of internal and external audit-
ing primarily to ensure that the investment and production activities of enter-
orises conform to state plans. Any deviations are brought to the attention
of higher authcrities. Each enterprise and industrial central has its own
internal controllers, appointed by the Ministry with the approval of the
Ministry of Finance, who carry out a basic annual audit. The Bank would re-
ceive annual audit reports of the Turceni Enterprise and the Borrower prepared
by the ilinistry of Finance (Sections 6.01(e) and (f) of the Loan Agreement).
Also, a letter supplemental to the Loan Agreement to be delivered by the
Guarantor and the Borrower would provide for the Bank to receive annual audit
reports by the Ministry of Finance on the accounts and results of the Indus-
trial Central for Electric Power and Heat. These arrangements would adequate-
ly meet the Bank's information requirements in this respect.
Procurement
55.       Procurement of the items financed by the Bank loan would follow
interniational competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines and
would be coordinated by ROMENERGC. It would involve the purchase of com-
plete components (such as standby diesel sets and ash handling plant) to be
delivered directly to the site, and of equipment and materials (such as
special steel plates and pipes) for incorporation in, and manufacture of,
the boilers, turbines and generators being made in Romania. In general,
Romanian suppliers, although eligible to bid, are not expected to bid, since
the list of equipment and materials to be financed by the Bank has been pre-
pared after excluding all goods likely to be available locally.
Disbursements
56.       The Bank loan would be disbursed against the foreign exchange costs
of imported equipment, components and materials and against the ex-factory
price of locally manufactured equipment and materials, should Romanian sup-
oliers bid successfully. No disbursement would be made for costs incurred
prior to the signing of the loan. A schedule of expected disbursements is
given in Annex III.
Ecology
57.       Specific attention has been given both to plant design and location
in order to minimize the risks to the physical and social environment of the
area. In fact, choice of the station site as against other alternatives was
largely made on an analysis of ash and gas emission which would pertain to
the full development of Turceni to 2,640 MW, together with the influence of
neighboring lignite-burning plants (Craiova and Rovinari). The design of
Turceni abides by the satisfactory pollution standards set by Romanian law.
Tthe Turceni Enterprise would submit regularly reports to the Bank on pollution
concentration levels and any necessary corrective action taken.



- 15 -
58.       The environmental effects arising from the open cast mining of
lignite will be dealt with by rehabilitation of tlhe overburden dumps and
worked-out areas by contouring, fertilizing and replanting.
Labor Force
59.       Permanent employment in the Turceni power station will be approx-
imately 1500. Of this total about 90 percent are skilled and unskilled workers,
the remainder being engineers and other professional staff. About 5,500 people
will be employed during the construction phase of the project. At peak oper-
ation (i.e. after 1980) the mining activity associated with the project will
involve the employment of about 5,000.
Justification
60.       The appraisal mission has reviewed the methods the Romanian author-
ities use for forward planning and making investment decisions, including the
derivation of least cost programs; unfortunately, the authorities made avail-
able only part of the data necessary to allow the validity of these methods
to be assessed fully and such data were restricted to a choice between spe-
cific thermal alternatives. Nevertheless, given the plans for developlment
of both nuclear and hydro-based power, which were described in outline, and
taking account of the largely peaking characteristics of the hydro resources,
we believe there is ample room for base load thermal plants such as Turceni.
Within the range of thermal alternatives the choice of lignite as a fuel is
amply justified by comparison with imported fuel oil (or implicitly with
gas), since at fuel oil prices of $8 a barrel the lignite choice is the
least cost solution at discount rates up to 25 percent.
61.       The economic rate of return on the project is 8.6 percent if bene-
fits are measured by incremental revenue attributable to the Project and
financial costs are adjusted for taxes and internal transfers. However,
this incremental revenue understates the benefits consumers receive from the
Project, since the level of tariffs (particularly for industrial users) is
low, with only marginal changes since 1963. Also, the incremental revenue
excludes the social benefits deriving from expanded industrial employment
and urbanization which the incremental energy provided by the Project would
help to foster. In the light of the foregoing arguments, the development of
an indigenous lignite fuel resource and a thermal power station based on it,
is judged to be an appropriate part of the development plan.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
62.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Investment Bank,
the draft Guarantee Agreement between The Socialist Republic of Romania and
the Bank, the report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the draft resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The special features of the loan documents are described above.



- 16 -
63.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreel2ent of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
64.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
