INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NIGERIA
FOR A RICE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Nigeria for equivalent of US$17.5 million to help finance development
of swamp valleys of East-Central and South-Eastern States of Nigeria for rice
cultivation by some 6.000 small farmers. The loan would have a term of 20
years, including a five-year grace period, with interest at 8 percent per
annum. The bulk of the proceeds of the loan would be on-lent by the Federal
Government to the two states on the same terms as the Bank loan.
PART I -    E %?0m7`"
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Nigeria"
(416a-UNI) dated August 5, 1974 was distributed to the Executive Directors.
The country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
Recent Developments
3.        The most striking feature of Nigeria's economic performance since
1970 is the remarkably rapid recovery from the dislocations and disruptions
caused by the civil war. GDP rose by nearly 50 percent in the two years
immediately following the war. This exceptionally high growth obviously
included a large element of "catching-up" as the economy responded to the pent-
up demands of the civil war period and as investment and production which had
been postponed during the hostilities were rapidly realized. As this phase
came to a close, a decline in the rate of growth to more normal levels was
to be expected. Moreover, during 1972 and 1973, agricultural production was
adversely affected by drought in the Northern States, and the output of some
manufacturing industries (e.g., textiles and footwear) fell as a result of
intensified competition from imports, following the policy of liberalization
introduced in early 1972. As a result, GDP at factor cost is estimated to have
risen by about 8 percent in 1972/73. Growth in 1973/74 may be in the range of
6-7 percent. The country's GDP during 1970/71 through 1972/73 was about 45
percent higher than in the three years immediately preceding the war. The
implied growth rate during the period 1964-66 to 1970-72 (6.3 percent a year)
compares favorably with the 6 percent attained during the fifties and early
sixties.
4.        This rapid economic recovery resulted mainly from expansion of
petroleum mining. Crude oil production rose from around 630,000 barrels per
day (bbls/day) in early 1970 to 1.8 million bbls/day in early 1972 and 2.0
million bbls/day by mid-1973. Government services too increased quickly on
the basis of considerable growth of revenues from the oil sector. On the



- 2 -
average, manufactures also grew faster than total output. However, petro-
leum production is an enclave activity, and manufacturing and modern services
afford employment for a small share of the labor force. Nigeria essentially
remains an agricultural economy in spite of a substantial shift in the com-
position of output since the period immediately before the civil war. Agri-
culture accounted for 46 percent of domestic product in 1971/72 (i.e., prior
to the increase in oil prices) and employed some 70 percent of the labor force.
Consequently, Nigeria's per capita income (about $130 in 1972) largely reflects
the low productivity of its traditional agriculture.
5.        The considerable growth of domestic product and income in recent
years was accompanied by similar increases in all major components of aggre-
gate expenditure. In real terms, exports in the period 1971/72 through 1973/74
averaged about twice the pre-war levels, imports increased by almost 90 per-
cent, investment by over 65 percent, and consumption expenditures by about
50 percent. Per capita real consumption and the rate of investment are well
above pre-war levels. Private sector investments have been high in both oil
and non-oil activities, especially manufacturing among the latter. Public
investment (valued at 1970/71 prices) rose from N148 million in 1970/71 to
N340 million in 1972/73 and was budgetted at N600 million in 1973/74. Never-
theless, implementation of the public investment program contained in the
Second Development Plan is behind schedule, due partly to a delay of ten
months in the issuance of the Plan and, more significantly, to inadequate
executive capacity for project preparation and implementation. Recognizing
these problems, the Government decided to postpone the start of the next Plan
by a year. The Third Development Plan is now scheduled to start early in 1975,
and will cover the five-year period 1975-80. Provisional guidelines for the
Third Plan, issued in July 1973, are currently being reviewed in the light of
the new situation brought about by the recent sharp rise in oil revenues.
General Gowan's Independence Day message of October 1, 1974, indicates that
the Government is now contemplating a much bigger program of investment than
outlined in the July 1973 Guidelines.
6.        Nigeria's balance of payments and fiscal position have also shown
dramatic improvement essentially because of the rapid growth of petroleum
exports. Total exports have risen from N885 million in 1970 to N2,227 million
in 1973, with oil accounting for practically all the increase. Imports have
also grown (from N756 million in 1970 to N1,234 million in 1973), but more
slowly than exports. This has enabled the Government to reduce short-term
external debt and to progressively relax the restrictions on import payments
and repatriation of dividends. The few remaining licensing and payment
controls in respect of goods and factor services have been removed in the
last budget. Foreign exchange reserves have increased dramatically following
the recent increases in oil price, and preliminary figures as of early October
1974 indicate that external reserves exceed $4 billion, equivalent to about
15 months' imports.
7.        The increase in oil revenues from N70 million in 1969/70 to N730
million in 1972/73 was also the major factor in transforming the Government's
fiscal position. In 1969/70, the Federal and State budgets taken together



-3-
showed an overall deficit of N349 million; in 1971/72, they showed an overall
surplus of N268 million. Because of a sharp increase in expenditures, 1972/73
recorded a small overall deficit. But the recent rise in oil prices is likely
to result in an unprecedented overall surplus during 1973/74 and the current
year despite big increases in budgetted expenditures. This growing fiscal
strength, however, has been largely confined, so far, to the Federal Govern-
ment. In general, the states have been barely able to balance their revenue
leaving little resources to finance capital expenditures. The Federal Govern-
ment has made large grants and low interest loans to alleviate the situation.
The picture is likely to change dramatically as a result of the new revenue-
sharing arrangement announced by General Gowan in his Independence Day address.
Under the new arrangement, the states as a group are expected to have suffi-
cient resources to meet all their current expenditures and about two-thirds
of the projected capital expenditures.
8.        The improved budgetary situation, liberalization of imports and
recovery of production in the eastern states have, together, helped abate
inflationary pressures. The Lagos Consumer Price Index rose by less than 3
percent in 1972 and a little over 4 percent in 1973, compared to an average
of 13 percent or more per annum between 1968 and 1971.
9.        Other major developments in the last two years include a far-
reaching reform of the Marketing Board System, a substantial increase in
producer prices for agricultural products, the acquisition of a 55 percent
equity participation in virtually all foreign operations in the oil sector,
and the establishment of the Bank for Commerce and Industry to assist in-
digenous entrepreneurs. A population census, conducted in November-December
1973, indicates Nigera's population to be around 80 million. These results
are provisional and subject to review by a Committee of Experts. The final
population figures are not expected before the end of the current year. At
the political level, the most noteworthy event is the announcement of the
Federal Military Government's decision to postpone the return to civilian
rule, originally set for 1976.
Medium and Long-Term Prospects
10.       Even before the recent rise in oil prices, as pointed out in the
Basic Economic Report (Report No. AW-35a), it was apparent that the resources
generated by oil would permit Nigeria to undertake a bold program of public
development expenditures and plan for a sustained, rapid growth during the
next decade. The Guidelines for the Third Plan issued in July 1973 visualized
total public investment at some 80 percent higher than in the Second Plan
with emphasis on agriculture and rural development and on widening and deepen-
ing the industrial structure. With the prospect of vastly larger oil revenues,
the Government has decided to further increase the scale of projected invest-
ments. The Head of State recently announced that the public sector investment
program in the Third Plan would be about N20 billion, out of an estimated
total investment of N30 billion. This is expected to generate a 9 percent



annual increase in incomes. Apart from larger outlays in agriculture, roads,
education, health and infrastructure, massive investments in oil-related
industries like LNG, fertilizers and refineries are visualized. The need and
scope for the projected investments is beyond doubt. The finance and foreign
exchange necessary to sustain them are also available. The Government is aware
that shortage of executive capacity poses a serious problem, and efforts are
being made to overcome this constraint. Clearly the fulfillment of the Third
Plan targets depends critically on the success in building up the necessary
capacity to prepare, implement and manage projects.
11.       The Bank's Economic Mission, reviewing Nigeria's medium and long-
term growth prospects in the light of the new oil prices, estimated that,
with oil prices remaining constant in real terms, oil output rising moderately
and public expenditures growing at the rate of 13 percent a year (in real
terms), the economy has the potential to sustain an average annual growth of
over 9 percent through the mid-eighties, provided the investment program is
implemented efficiently. The potential growth would be somewhat lower (8.3
percent a year) if oil prices in real terms were to decline moderately, oil
output were kept constant and public expenditures grew by only 10-11 percent
a year. Even with such high rates of growth, Nigeria in the mid-eighties
would still be a relatively poor country with per capita real income of
around $500.
12.       Under the above assumptions, Nigeria is expected to remain in over-
all balance of payments surplus during the remainder of the 1970s. Accumu-
lated reserves at the end of the Third Plan (1980/81) may lie in the vicinity
of 18 months' import value, the value of imports having risen by that time
to around $13 billion in terms of current prices. However, the overall balance
of payments is likely to be in deficit by the early eighties, and the deficit
could rise rapidly. The range of possible outcomes during the eighties is
very wide and will be very sensitive to the behavior of oil prices, output
and public expenditures. With relatively low growth of public expenditure,
constant real oil prices and rising oil output, total reserves in 1985/86
could be equivalent to less than 10 months' imports. But, with higher growth
of government expenditures, lower oil prices and constant oil production,
Nigeria could well have exhausted all its reserves by that time.
External Assistance
13.       Nigeria's need for external assistance to help accelerate invest-
ment in the more intractable areas such as agriculture and rural development
and to increase executive and managerial capacity in the infrastructure
sectors is the more urgent as the country's resources increase. The Federal
Government's attitude towards foreign private capital is that it should com-
plement, not compete with domestic capital. This applies to official exter-
nal assistance as well. Priority is, therefore, being given to multilateral
and bilateral projects and programs which act as catalysts to investment
efforts in the high priority areas and increase indigenous capability to
control, manage and promote the growth of the economy efficiently in the



-5-
future. Against this background the Federal government and the Bank agree
that, at least over the next Plan period (1975-1980), the primary objective
of Bank activities in Nigeria should continue to be to assist Government
efforts to increase investment in the high priority areas of agricultural
and rural infrastructure development and to improve public sector capability
to manage and promote the future growth of the modern sectors, rather than
to increase available resources. During recent discussions with the Govern-
ment, it was also agreed that the most efficient and effective means of
providing this assistance would be in association with capital projects
typically financed by the Bank, such as the projects proposed today.
14.       Nigeria's creditworthiness for additional borrowing on conventional
terms is not in question. As of December 31, 1972, total external public and
publicly guaranteed debt, including undisbursed loans, amounted to an estimated
$1,035 million, of which approximately $57 million represented supoliers'
credits. Outstanding but undisbursed commitments of official capital were
about $426 million. Debt service in 1972 was 2.5 percent of gross exports, or
less than 4 percent of exports less factor payments. In view of the substan-
tially improved resource position of the country, and the consequent uncer-
tainty as to the level of its future borrowings, it would not be possible to
state, at this stage, what the Bank's share of Nigeria's total outstanding
debt or debt service will be in the next five years. The Bank Group's share
of total external public debt (including undisbursed) at the end of 1972 was
about 45 percent. This relatively high share essentially reflects Nigeria's
low level of external debt ($14 per capita in 1972) rather than substantial
lending by the Bank ($6 per capita, including undisbursed, at the end of 1972).
15.       The Government of Nigeria is favorably inclined to re-cycle a
portion of its accumulating resources for the benefit of the developing
world. During the past six months, Nigeria has increased its subscription
to the African Development Bank and announced that it will no longer seek
to borrow from that institution; donated $800,000 to the Consultative Group
for International Agricultural Research, thus becoming the first developing
country to contribute to the Group; and contributed SDR100 million to the IMF
Oil Facility. In addition, Nigeria has recently agreed to make a substantial
purchase of Bank bonds, the terms of which are currently under negotiation.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NIGERIA
16.       Bank/IDA lending to Nigeria to date amounts to $621.9 million (net
of cancellations) of which $370.8 million was committed during the period of
the Second National Development Plan. Transport and power together account
for $428.2 million or about 69 percent of the total, and agriculture, educa-
tion, industry and the post-war rehabilitation loan account for the remaining
31 percent; excluding the program loan, the respective shares are about 75
percent for transport and power and 25 percent for the other three sectors.
Although disbursements have been lagging, the execution of projects has gen-
erally been satisfactory. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans
and IFC investments and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.



- 6 -
17.       Bank activities since 1970 have generally been aimed at assisting
Nigeria in the following three broad areas: (a) reconstruction and rehabili-
tation of the economy after the civil war; (b) institution-building in the
public sector; and (c) extensive economic, sector and project preparation
work. In pursuance of these aims, Bank commitments in FYs 1971, 1972, 1973
and 1974 amounted to $97.2 million, $119.6 million, $54 million and $75
million, respectively; during the same period, an economic mission and agri-
culture, education and transportation sector missions visited Nigeria; and
extensive assistance was provided to the State Governments in identifying and
perparing projects designed to raise the production and incomes of small
farmers.
18.       The proposed project, and the four other projects under considera-
tion today, reflect the increasing emphasis being given to agriculture and
rural development in the Federal Government's plans for investing oil revenues
for the benefit of the bulk of the population who live in rural areas. Nego-
tiations with the Bank have been completed for three further agricultural
projects directed towards raising the production of palm oil from nucleus
estates and smallholdings in the Western, Mid-Western and East Central States.
Other projects in an advanced state of processing will be concerned with small-
holder rubber production in the Mid-Western State and an irrigation scheme
near Kano, and work is underway on the preparation of two further rural develop-
ment projects, similar to those being presented today, in the Benue Plateau and
Kwara States in the center of the country. These last four projects should be
ready for presentation to Executive Directors within the next eighteen months.
Outside agriculture the activities of the Bank Group are being restricted over
the next few years to a small number of projects for which the Federal Govern-
ment has requested assistance in building up new institutions required to
strengthen essential infrastructure and to provide employment for the rapidly
growing urban population. Work is currently proceeding on the preparation of
projects for small-scale industry and water supply and sewerage in small towns
and rural areas. The possibility of Bank assistance in the reorganization of
the telecommunications sector has been discussed, but no decision has been
taken. No further lending is presently envisaged for highways, power or
education which have been important areas of Bank Group involvement in the
past. However, two education projects are still at an early stage of imple-
mentation, and their supervision will make considerable demands on the time
of Bank staff. The work of the Bank's Resident Mission in Lagos is largely
concentrated on project preparation in agriculture and public utilities and
on the supervision of on-going projects in these and other sectors.
19.       Since foreign exchange as such is no longer a scarce resource in
Nigeria, the extent of the Bank's participation in the financing of individual
projects is being determined more by reference to what is considered to be an
appropriate share of total costs. For projects which have high priority in
meeting basic economic and social problems such as those in agriculture and
rural development, where the direct foreign exchange component may also be
relatively low, the Bank has been financing 50% of total costs, and this is
the formula proposed for the sharing of costs of the five projects under
consideration today and the three other projects for which loans have already



- 7 -
been negotiated. In the case of four of the five projects under consideration
today the foreign exchange component ranges between 47 and 51%; for the Rice
project it is 30%. This cost-sharing formula will be re-examined before
further negotiations take place.
20.       During the five years since the end of the civil war in January
1970, Bank Group commitments to Nigeria have averaged about $80 million a
year. Disbursements on Bank loans to Nigeria have lagged well behind commit-
ments. During the current fiscal year, they are not expected to exceed $54
million on a gross basis, or $18 million net of interest and principal repay-
ments to the Bank. A large increase in the level of lending was discussed
with the Nigerian Government wo years ago when it was assumed that Nigeria
would continue to require a substantial inflow of external capital for financ-
ing investments in the power and transport sectors which had absorbed the
bulk of previous Bank loans. Now that these requirements can be met from
Nigeria's own resources, the level and direction of Bank lending in future
years will have to be reviewed in the context of the country's new Five-Year
Plan, and such a review is planned for April or May next year when the Govern-
ment expects discussions on the Plan to have been completed.
PART III - AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA
21.       Agriculture, including livestock, fisheries and forestry is by
far the most important source of output and employment: in 1971/72 it
contributed about $4 billion or 46 percent of the country's gross domestic
product and about 70 percent of the labor force is estimated to be employed
in this sector.
22.       Nigerian agriculture is primarily domestic market oriented.    Nearly
90 percent of her production - comprising all staple food crops and animal
products, most palm oil and cotton, and a substantial part of groundnuts - is
consumed within the country. Nigeria is nearly self-sufficient in foods.
In 1971-72, total imports of food and beverages - of which meat, milk and
sugar are the main items - were of the order of $145 million or less than
5 percent of estimated total food consumption. Exports of agricultural
products in 1971-72 were valued at $265 million. Until the mid-sixties, they
were the dominant element in Nigeria's export trade, but have since been over-
taken by crude oil. Even so, they are still a significant source of foreign
exchange and account for the bulk of the non-oil exports.
23.       Nigeria can be divided into three major agricultural and ecolog-
ical zones; a southern wet forest zone comprising the Western, Mid-Western,
East-Central, South-Eastern and Rivers States, characterized by high rainfall
and a tropical climate and growing mainly perennial tree crops, namely cocoa,
rubber and oil palm; a central dry forest zone known as the middle belt
embracing the whole of Kwara State, Benue Plateau, the southern parts of
North-Western, North-Central and North-Eastern States which is underpopulated



- 8 -
and tsetse infested, but has a high potential for annual food crops and live-
stock; and a northern zone which, being free from tsetse has a high population
density and a fairly intensive and developed system of agriculture.      This area
covers about 50 percent of the country, and in addition to supporting most of
Nigeria's cattle population, also produces most of her cereals, beans, ground-
nuts and cotton.
24.       Land holdings are typically small.    The average farmed area per
holding for the country as a whole is estimated to be less than three
acres. In some of the more densely populated areas of the south, the
average is less than one acre. There are few farm families with more than
25 acres of cultivated area. Farmers follow for the most part traditional
techiniques of which bush fallowing and mixed cropping are characteristic
features. The practice of bush fallowing is essentially a device to main-
tain soil fertility. Mixed cropping permits farmers to get more output
per acre with smaller risks of crop failure. However, since improved seed,
fertilizers and other elements of modern technology are used on a very
limited scale, average yields are still low. Small holdings and poor produc-
tivity explain the relatively low level of income in the agricultural sector.
There are also considerable disparities in the distribution of land and
incomes both between and within regions.
25.       While reliable data are lacking, it is believed that agricultural
production since the early sixties has been growing only slightly faster
than population. Agriculture has certainly been growing much slower than
other sectors, and as a result, its share in GDP has been declining. The
relative sluggishness of agriculture is largely attributable to the exist-
ing low level of agricultural technology.    The disruption of production in
the eastern states during the civil war was an aggravating factor.      Since
then, the recovery has been hampered by short-term factors such as drought
in parts of the north in 1972-73 and 1973-74, but, more particularly, by
a number of underlying long-term influences. Some of the most important
factors among these are the rising age-profile of tree crops, technical and
other constraints to accelerated food crop production, e.g., the lack of
improved crop varieties and adequate credit facilities to finance the pur-
clhase of modern farm inputs. Imports of food, though still small, have
risen from around $70 million in 1965-66 to $145 million in 1972.      The slow
growth of production has also affected exports. Cocoa and rubber exports
have remained stagnant in recent years. Palm oil exports have dwindled to
negligible amounts and palm kernel exports are stagnating at well below
pre-war levels. Groundnut exports in 1972 were some 80 percent below the
1965 level and were even lower in 1973 because of the drought in the north.
In addition the availability of groundnuts for export has been affected by
substitution of groundnut for palm oil in domestic consumption and the rela-
tively better price offered to farmers by private traders. A near record
groundnut crop is in prospect for 1974. Cotton, once a major export, is now
fully utilized by the local textile industry and local supply cannot meet
demand.



- 9 -
26.       A vigorous effort to step-up the growth of agricultural and live-
stock production is essential for viable development of the economy. The
demand for agricultural products is growing rapidly. On a rough estimate,
the resources generated by the oil sector would be adequate to sustain a
growth rate of over 9 percent per annum in real terms over the next decade.
This will generate a 6 percent average annual increase in domestic demand
for farm products. Unless the rate of agricultural growtlh is accelerated,
the economy faces the prospect of large and increasing food imports. More
importantly, continued slow growth of agricultural production implies a
slow improvement in the living conditions of the mass of the population with
the attendant risks of further aggravation of rural-urban disparities.
27.       Nigeria has vast unexploited potential for increasing agricultural
production. The productivity of practically all segments of agriculture -
food, export crops, and livestock - are far below levels attainable with
modern farming methods. In addition there are extensive areas of good agri-
cultural and grazing land which, if developed along scientific lines, could
greatly increase production. While improved varieties and teclhniques adapted
to local conditions are not available for all crops and regions, much can be
done on the basis of existing knowledge. Significant improvements in pro-
ductivity of many of the major export and cereal crops have been demonstrated
to be technically and economically feasible.   The main constraints are organi-
zational and institutional:   until recently Government efforts to help the
farmers to learn and apply the known teclhniques for raising production ihave
not been on a scale commensurate with needs and possibilities. Extension
services in many states are poorly staffed, credit and marketing institutions
are few, planning is weak and the expertise needed to implement successfully
major agricultural and other rural development projects is in short supply.
There are also complex social and institutional problems to be overcome before
the land potential, including the resources of the middle belt, can be effec-
tively exploited, and the livestock industry organized along modern lines.
23.       The Federal and State Governments are conscious of the need for
greater attention to agriculture and of the impediments to be overcome before
significant progress can be achieved. Several major new programs initiated
within the last year or two bear witness to a heightened Government concern
for and interest in agricultural development. These include the creation of
the Nigerian Agricultural Bank, the launching of an accelerated food produc-
tion program, larger and better organized projects for replanting/planting of
tree crops and integrated agricultural development projects in different
parts of the country. At the request of the Government, the Bank has actively
assisted in the preparation of many of these projects.    The Bank economic
mission in 1973 made an overall survey of the potential and prospects for
food production. Agriculture and rural development generally are of crucial
importance to Nigeria's long-term growth, and the Bank plans to continue
assisting Nigeria in preparing and implementing projects in this area.
29.       Nigeria's food production policy has to respond not only to popula-
tion growth, particularly in the rapidly growing urban and industrial sectors,



- 10 -
hut also to income growtli and the changing dietary preference of the popula-
tion away from root crops to cereals.   Rice consumption in Nigeria is about
250,000 tons per annum now and is expected to increase to about 600,000 tons
per annum in 1985.   The Government's objective is to become self-sufficient
in rice by 1985.
30.       Nigeria is the second largest rice producer in West Africa with an
annual production of about 240,000 tons. To meet the growing domestic demand
for rice, it imported about 6,000 tons in 1972. The principal rice orowing
areas are the North Western, Benue Plateau, Western and North Eastern states.
The East Central and South Eastern states, whose producing areas are located
in the inland and rain-fed swamps, account for about 13 percent of national
rice production. Due to population pressures, farms in these Eastern states
are small. Yields on these farms are low, averaging about 700 kg per hectare.
In both these states farmers are being actively encouraged to cultivate rice
through swamp valley development. While there is adequate institutional
support, including research and training facilities, a coordinated agricultural
development program is lacking. The proposed project, which would serve as
a pilot project for expanding rice cultivation in swamp valleys, seeks to
strengthen Nigerian agricultural institutions and improve the economic well-
being of a significant number of smallholder farmers while at the same time
utilizing the area's land, water and manpower potential.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
31.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Nigeria Rice Project'" (371-u,I)
_'ated September 23, 1974, is being distributed separately. A loan and
project summary is attached as Annex III along with a map showing the pro-
ject area.
32.       The proposed project was identified by a Bank mission in November
1972 and prepared by the FAO/IBPD Cooperative Program. It was appraised
in September/October 1973 by a Bank mission and negotiated in Washington
in July, 1974 with a delegation headed by Mr. Alhaji Abubakar, Deputy
Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Finance.
Project Description
33.       rhe project involving about 9,0(00 ha would be the first phase in
the development of potential rice projects in swamp valley areas in the Last
Central and Southl Eastern states.  The project would be implemented over a
five year period. As a restult of the project, about 6,000 families now
farming at close to subsistance level would each receive an irrigated plot
of 1.25 ha or 1.5 ha of swamn rice in addition to their present holdings.
The project would comprise an integrated rice development program which would
introduce imnroved varieties and modern farming techniques. The main features



- 11 -
of the project are (a) development of 7,060 ha of swamp land by drainage or
control of water levels for growing one crop of rice, and 1,850 ha of swamp
land by irrigation to grow two crops of rice per year; (b) erection and oper-
ation of eight rice mills and associated facilities for paddy purchase, trans-
port, parboiling and storage; (c) rehabilitation of 186 km of existing feeder
roads and construction of 117 km of new feeder roads; (d) provision of seasonal
credit for farm inputs and for hired farm labor to project participants;
(e) provision of extension and support services, and establishment and oper-
ation of farm service centers, which would include demonstration farms and
seed-multiplication units; (f) provision of training facilities, including
farmer and specialist training in irrigation and rice agronomy; (g) monitoring
and evaluating the project's economic and social impact, and (h) studies for
further expansion of swamp rice development in the two states. Principal ex-
penditures would be for land development (21%); project management, agricultural
extension services and credit services (17%); rice milling and marketing (13%);
road improvement (9%); farm inputs, specialist services, training, etc. (9%);
and contingencies (31%).
Project Execution
34.       The first rice planting on project lands would commence in the
third year of development and the project would be completed in five years.
There would be a Project Manager within each of the Ministries of Agriculture
in the East Central, and South Eastern States and to ensure coordination
Project Steering Committees would be established in the two States. The pro-
ject organization in each state would consist of: (i) a headquarters unit
responsible for planning the implementation of the project and the credit oper-
ations, organization, administration and supervision of the project; (ii)
mobile units responsible for field surveys and land development, including
irrigation, road improvement, etc.; (iii) scheme units responsible for settle-
ment, agricultural extension, training of farmers, establishment and operation
of farm service centers, etc.; and (iv) milling and marketing units.
35.       For implementation purposes, the project would be divided into five
schemes, three in the East Central and two in the South Eastern state. A
program of consecutive valley development would be employed with the equipment
and staff of each scheme being concentrated on one valley at a time. The
State Governments would acquire land required for project use, and the develop-
ment of these lands for project purposes would be the responsibility of the
respective project organizations in the two states. Project farmers owning
not more tnan 4 ha of land would be selected by local settlement committees and
selected farmers would be provided with two-year leases initially, renewable
automatically, except in cases where breach of the farm holding agreement
occurs. The plots allotted would be 1.25 ha of irrigated or 1.5 ha of swamp
land. Project farmers would contribute family labor for maintenance of the
farms. Advice and supervision for land levelling, soil preparation and rice
cultivation would be provided by project staff and farmers would be required
to cultivate to prescribed standards and maintain farm irrigation and drainage
works as conditions of their leases.



36.       Each of the five schemes would support a training center to provide
non-residential courses for both farmers and staff. Training programs would
also be provide(d for specialists in irrigation and rice agronomy. Farm service
centers would be set up at each of the project sites to undertake trials
involving rice varieties, fertilizers and low cost farm machinery, and to
undertake multiplication of seeds of high yielding varieties for sale to
project farmers.
37.       Seasonal credit would be provided in kind to project farmers.
Credits would comprise seed, fertilizers and agricultural clhemicals. Credits
would also be made in cash for meeting the cost of hired farm labor. All
credits would be amortized within twelve months and would carry an interest
rate in the range of 5 to 9-1/2 percent per annum, the specific rate being
determined annually in consultation with the Bank. Credit would be repaid
at the end of each season by deductions from the proceeds of paddy sales
made to rice mills operated by the project organizations. Four rice mills
would be operated in each of the two states. The mills would be equipped
with storage facilities and would act as focal points for farm input delivery,
credit collection and other dealings with project farmers. While each proj-
ect organization would be staffed by qualified Nigerian personnel to the
maximum extent possible, it would be necessary to recruit on an international
basis a limited number of specialist and technical staff such as irrigation
engineers and milling specialists. The appointment of such specialists is
a condition of loan effectiveness (see Section 8.01 (c) of Loan Agreement
and Section 2.06 (b) of Project Agreement).
38.       To facilitate development in the project areas, 186 km of existing
feeder roads would be rehabilitated and upgraded and 117 km of new feeder
roads constructed. The road improvement program would be completed in four
years.
39.       As the project would be the first in a program of system.atic de-
velopment of rice in swamp valleys in the two states, the Federal Governmenlt
would conduct a program to monitor and evaluate the economic and social
impact of the project in both states, and consultants would be employed to
prepare detailed feasibility studies of possible second-phase projects.
During project implementation and operation, the impact of the project on
health aspects will be monitored through the medium of annual surveys.    To
ensure coordination among the different entities involved in project imple-
mentation, a project coordinating committee would be established in each
state (see Section 2.06 of Project Agreement). The operational phase of
the projects would be taken over by the concerned departments of the states
in accordance with plans to be prepared by the respective project organi-
zations during the fourth year of project development (see Section 2.08
(a) of Project Agreement).
40.       The scattered nature of development areas and the lack of basic
hydrological and other data are likely to present problems of implemen-
tation of the project. As a first step for initiating engineering layouts
for drainage and irrigation systems, aerial photography of the project



- 13 -
area has been commissioned and the provision of the photomosaics is a
condition of loan effectiveness (see Section 8.01 (d) of Loan Agreement).
To minimize uncertainties during the course of implementation, the project
organizations would present an annual work plan to the Bank for approval
and include therein detailed land development and road improvement plans,
relevant hydrological data and designs of irrigation diversion works and
canals. The type of physical development proposed in the project, i.e.
flood protection, drainage and irrigation of comparatively small seasonally
inundated areas for rice production in dispersed locations has potentially
wide application in the country.
Project Costs and Financing
41.       Project costs for the combined East Central and South Eastern State
schemes total $35.0 million, including contingencies amounting to $10.9
million. The foreign exchange costs of the project are estimated at $10.3
million and local costs at $24.7 million. The Bank would finance 50% of
project costs which would meet the entire foreign exchange costs and 29% of
the local currency costs of the project. The remaining 50% of the costs
would be financed by the Borrower and the State Governments. The financial
plan for the project is as follows:

42.       Out of the proposed Bank loan of $17.5 million, $10.2 million
would be onlent to the East Central State and about $6.5 million to the
South Eastern State, under subsidiary Loan Agreements acceptable to the
Bank, and US$0.8 million would be used by the Federal Government for project
monitoring, evaluation, Phase II studies, and training facilities. The Bank
loan would be repayable over 20 years including a five-year grace period
for principal. Proceeds of the loan onlent by the Federal Government to
the two states would have the same terms as the Bank loan.
43.       Recovery of project costs from beneficiaries would be through
(a) profits earned by the project organizations in milling and sale of



- 14 -
Project produced rice, and (b) project charges of N1O/ha for swamp rice land and
N25/ha for irrigated rice land, payable by project farmers, to enable
direct investment and operating and maintenance costs to be recovered over
a 50-year period without interest. Over the 20-year loan period, the total
amount recovered is estimated at $38 million of which about $27 million
would be recovered through the profits of milling and marketing operations.
Procurement
44.       Vehicles, plant, equipment, rice mills, fertilizers and chemicals,
estimated at about $6.5 million, would be procured through international com-
petitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement,"
except for contracts of less than $25,000. The opportunities for turn-
key contracts for the rice mills, including training of staff and supervision
of operation of the mills in the initial months would be explored. In bid
comparison, domestically manufactured goods would be allowed a preference of
15% or customs duty, whichever is lower, and local contractors a preference
of 7-1/2%. Since contracts for buildings, houses, etc., valued at $4.7
million, consist of small items at dispersed locations, they are not expected
to attract international competition. Calls for bids in these cases would be
advertised only locally. Land development, and most feeder road construction,
would be done on force account or through negotiated contracts with small
contractors. Remaining project expenses of about US$23.8 million would
involve payments to labor and staff, operating expenditures during the
project development period, and building, vehicle and equipment maintenance.
Disbursement
45.       The proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed over a five-year
period against: (a) 100% of foreign exchange expenditures for rice milling
and parboiling equipment and related facilities, vehicles, tractors, construc-
tion material and fertilizers and chemicals, about US$5.9 million; (b) 100%
of the cost of internationally recruited specialists, training program and
project monitoring and evaluation., about US$2.9 million; (c) 50% of the cost
of hired farm labor, about $0.2 million; (d) 45% of the cost of operating
and maintaining project vehicles, plant, equipment and buildings, and salaries
of local staff and labor, about US$7.5 million; and (e) 40% of expenditures
for buildings and houses, about US$1 million.
Economic Evaluation
46.       At full development in 1983, the project would produce annually
21,000 tons of milled parboiled rice, and about 1,800 tons of bran for animal
feed with a total value of about US$6 million. Farmers' annual net cash
incomes are expected to rise from $112 to $450 for swamp rice farms and to
$1,225 for double-cropped irrigated rice farms. In all, 6,000 farm families,
including some 40,000 people, would benefit directly from the project. The
economic rate of return from investment in the project has been estimated
at 14.4 percent, based upon an import price of $182/MT, which was employed
for appraisal. However, the rate of return would be 25 percent on the basis
of an import price of $265/MT (at 1974 constant dollars) which is expected
to prevail at full project development. The project would generate employment



- 15 -
equivalent to about 3.6 million man-days during the construction phase and
230,000 man-days annually thereafter.
47.       The need to increase food production to keep pace with population
growth and to improve the low income levels of small farmers justify invest-
ment in the proposed project. The long-range benefits include the demonstra-
tion effect of high-yielding rice cultivation, improved communications, the
development of efficient seed multiplication and milling facilities, and the
strengthening of agricultural extension and credit institutions.
48.       The Federal Government would be responsible for conducting a pro-
gram to monitor the economic and social impact of the project development.
This would include measuring the changes in gross and net income of project
participants and how they use it, changes in volume of production, efficiency
of resource utilization, changes in gross and net income of off-farm pop-
ulation in surrounding villages and the impact on infrastructure and pro-
grams of social services.
49.       The project would be a first step in the systematic development
of swamp valleys for rice growing in the two States; and indeed would serve
as a pilot for such development in much of Nigeria. The physical and other
data needed for large-scale development are presently limited. Consequent-
ly, during project implementation, additional data would be gathered, expan-
sion potential would be identified, and project experience evaluated for
application in a large program of development. Studies of possible Phase
II projects would be completed in 1976 and would examine the feasibility
of (a) development of additional dry season water supplies to maximize
irrigation of swamp rice lands developed in Phase I project, (b) expansion
of Phase I areas by developing nearby swamp valley lands, and (c) develop-
ment of other swamp valley lands as nuclei for expansion of rice growing
in new areas.

C.  Projects in Execution
Credit 72-UNI, Education Pro ect:   US$20.0 million
Credit of March 1, 1965; Revised Closing Date: June 30, 1976
Loan 814-UNI, Second Education Project:   US$17.3 million
Loan of April 18,   1; Closin Date       December 31, 1975
Loan 929-UNI, Third Education Project: uS$54.o million
Loan of August 16, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The first education project (72-UNI) had a late start in implementa-
tion, particularly in the three eastern states which were affected by the
civil strife between 1967 and 1970. Execution of project schools in these
states is at working drawings stage while the majority of project schools
in other states are under construction. Completion of work in eastern
states might take about two more years. Pxecution of the second education
project (814-UNI) is generally satisfactory, although it is twelve months
behind schedule and special implementation assistance would be needed in
one state to avoid further delay. The third education project (929-UNI)
has not yet been declared effective pending appointment of consultant-
architects and execution of subsidiary loan agreements and legal opinion.
The effectiveness date has been postponed to December 31, 1974. Action
to appoint consultant-architects and to fulfill the other conditions of
effectiveness is progressing.
Loan 427-UNI, Western Road Project: US$14.5 million
Loan of September 26, 1965; Revised Closing Date: March 31, 1975
Loan 694-UNI, Transport Rehabilitation: US$25.0 million
Loan of June 26, 1970; Revised Closing Date: March 31, 1975
Loan 838-UNI Fifth Highway Project: US$26.3 million
Loan of June 16, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
There has been a saving of $2.5 million in Loan 427-UNI, out of which
procurement of road machinery and conduct of a photogrammatic survey would
be financed and the balance, estimated at approximately $2 million, would
likely be cancelled. Construction work and procurement under the Transport
Rehabilitation Loan (694-UNI) have proceeded satisfactorily except for
procurement of some railway equipment which has been affected by administra-
tive delays as well as delays in delivery schedule due to the energy crisis.
However, deliveries are now proceeding satisfactorily and the loan is expected
to be fully disbursed by March 31, 1975.
Loan 705-UNI, Nigerian Industrial Development Bank: US$10.0 million
Loan of August 28, 1970; Revised Closing Date: March 31, 1975
This loan is fully committed. Withdrawals out of this loan in 1973
were slower than expected owing to cancellation of sub-project loan commit-
ments.

Loan 764-UNI, Western Cocoa Project: US$7.2 million
Loan of June 23, 1971; Closing Date: March 31, 1977
Loan 1045-UNI, Second Cocoa Project: US$20 million
Loan of October 11, 1974; Closing Date: September 30, 1981
Though there was delay under Loan 764-UNI in the establishment of
the Cocoa Development Unit and only 65 percent of first year planting
was achieved, excellent progress was made and the 1973 planting target
and 1972 backlog have been fulfilled. The Second Cocoa Project (Loan
1045-UNI) i.s expected to become effective by January 1975.
Loan e,47-UNI, Fourth Power Project: US$76.0 million
Loan of June 30, 1972LClosing Date:    December 31, 1977
This loan became effective only on June 13, 1973, owing to delay
in connection with the Loan Assumption Agreement for the previous Bank
loans in this sector. Progress on the Bank project is considered satis-
factory.
Loan 922-UNI, Second Lagos Ports Project: US$55 million
Loan of August 1, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
This loan became effective on October 29, 1973 and implementation
of the project is proceeding satisfactorily.
