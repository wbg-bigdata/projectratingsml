APPRAISAL OF EDUCATION PROJECT
SUMMIARY
i.       The Uganda government has made a request to the International Develop-
ment Association for financial assistance to construct and equip 24 new general
secondary schools and add facilities to 15 existing similar schools.
ii.      The proposed project is of high priority.  It will increase general
secondary school enrollment to 33,200 by adding 13,900 new places. At the two
examination levels 3,800 new places will raise the potential total annual out-
put to 8,900.
iii.     The proposals will permit a revision of the secondary school structure
and curriculum by increasing science teaching and introducing practical courses.
iv.      The proposed expansion and increased pupil output meets the require-
ments as estimated by available manpower surveys. The instruction offered will
be appropriate to Uganda's labor market conditions.
V.       Hostel accommodation has been included for a maximum of 7,300 students
and will be designed so that it can also be used for teaching purposes if a
boarding school becomes a day school. About 260 staff houses of economical
standard are necessary.
vi.      The existing facilities for training secondary school teachers in
Uganda are sufficient to permit the projected expansion and Africanize the
teaching staff in the 1970's. The present staff of expatriates must, however,
be maintained or slightly increased during the next four years.
vii.     The proposed project will cost about US$14.3 million equivalent.  The
construction period is 1967-1970. The foreign exchange component at US$3.4
million is approximately 24 percent of total project cost. Both capital con-
tribution and recurrent costs are within the capacity of the Uganda government.
viii.    There is no shortage of architects and engineers but there may be some
lack of competition among the local contractors. However, all procurement will
be conducted in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines for international procure-
ment and construction contracts are expected to attract outside tenders.
ix.      The Ministry of Education has formed a separate project unit to
implement the proposed project. The organization of the Ministry and the
ability of the civil service in the field of education are such that success-
ful implementation of the proposed project is expected.
x.       Subject to certain conditions being fulfilled (paras. 7.10, 7.11),
the project is suitable for an IDA Credit in the proposed amount of US$10.0
million equivalent, which is about 70 percent of the estimated total cost of
the proposed project.

APPRAISAL OF EDUCATION PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01.    In November, 1965, the International Development -Association received
a request from the Uganda government for financial assistance, to expand and
improve general secondary education. Prior to the request a Unesco rep-
resentative bad assisted the Uganda government in the preparation of the
project.
1.02.    An appraisal mission composed of Messrs. Mats Hultin, Peter Oltmanns
and Hanna Pichler was in Uganda during November and December, 1965. This
report is based on the findings of the appraisal mission and its discussions
with officials in the Ministries of Education, Finance, Housing and Labor,
Works and Agriculture, the Central Planning Bureau, with the British High
Commissioner, U.S. Agency for International Development, the American Peace
Corps and the Swedish International Development Authority.
1.03.    Materials from economic planning and manpower surveys have been made
available. Information has been received from the National Housing Corpora-
tion, contracting firms and private architects. More than 20 educational
institutions have been visited. The mission also had discussions with Unesco
officials in Paris and the Unesco representative in East Africa.
2. BACKGROUND
2.01.    Uganda stands astride the equator near the center of Africa.  Much
of the country is a hilly plateau at an altitude of more than 1,200 m, which
endows it with a favorable climate. Uganda measures 236,000 sq. km. which
is comparable to the size of the United Kingdom. There are relatively dry
areas in the northern part of the country but otherwise precipitation is
abundant. The southern and western parts are fertile and offer good oppor-
tunities for farming. Agriculture is and will for a long period be the most
important activity in the country.
2.02.    The population of Uganda is 99 percent of African origin,
divided into tribal groups of which 16 each number more than 100,000. Of the
remainder, 86,000 are Asians and 9,000 Europeans.
2.03.    As shown by the map, the population is unevenly distributed, most of
it living near Lake Victoria and in the Southwest.  The populous areas are
characterized by the absence of villages and a scattered pattern of settle-
ment. Townships are few and small. Except for the Kampala area, the urban-
ization rate is estimated to be slow, even compared with other developing
countries. The official language is English. There are six major vernacular
tongues.



-2-
2.04.     The population in 1966 was estimated to be 7.7 million.  The economic-
ally active population (age group 16 to 49) represent about 44 percent of the
total. At the end of the Second Five-Year Plan - in 1971 - the population is
estimated to reach 8.8 million of which 43 percent are projected to be economic-
ally active.
2.05.     During the Second Five-Year Plan (1966-1971) an increase in total
wage employment of 100,000 is aimed at. Since 1960, employment has declined.
More recent figures show an upward trend but it is still doubtful whether
the target for 1971 will be achieved. The employment situation in the mone-
tary sector of the economy is shown below (Table 1).

Tn 1965/66 only 8 percent of the total working age population were employed in
statistically registered paid positions, but this is expected to increase to
10 percent by 1971.
2.06.     The African population is predominantly rural and works on smlall
private holdings on both subsistence and cash crops. The Asians are found
in trade and commerce and the Europeans in administration.
2.07.     Table 2 shows the educational profile of employed manpower and
projected trends of utilization from 1966 to 1971. It indicates that the
highest relative increase is for Higher School Certificate holders.

2.08.    WIhile the average economic growth 1960-1965 has been just under 4
percent per annum, the Second Five-Year Plan 1966-1971 aims at an average
rate of 6.5 percent per annum, and the long-range projection 1971-1981 fore-
sees a rate of 8 percent. Allowing for the population increase, this will
raise the GDP per capita from about L30 in 1965 to L40 in 1971 and L60 in
1981, compared with current figures of U14 in Malawi, 1,5 in Ethiopia, i20
in Tanzania, 130 in Kenya, and L65 in Zambia. The economic growth aimed at
is ambitious and may be difficult to achieve.
2.09.     The targets for 1971 require a projected total investment including
the private sector of L230 million over the period 1966-1971. This would be
more than twice the level of investment achieved during any previous five-
year period and it is doubtful if it can be fulfilled. Of interest for the
implementation of the proposed project is the output from the construction
sector which is expected to increase from about 3 percent of total monetary
GDP in 1966 to about 3.5 percent in 1971.

3. THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM
The Structure of Education
3.01.    Primary education is given as a seven-year course (Annex 1).
Pupils then have to pass an examination to qualify for transfer from pri-
mary to secondary education. A four- or six-year period of academic
secondary education is offered leading to examinations for the School
Certificate (SC) or the Higher School Certificate (HSC), respectively. The
latter is taken by selected pupils who are candidates for university
admission.
3.02.    As can be seen from Annex 1, students leaving primary education are
offered vocational training at secondary level in schools of many types.
Higher education institutions are also shown on the chart.
The Administration of Education
3.03.    The administration of education is centralized under the Ministry of
Education with headquarters in Kampala. The Ministry is organized in three
divisions (Annex 2). The efficiency of the organization has been somewhat
hampered by the federal structure of Uganda. The semi-autonomous kingdoms,
forming an important part of the country, have had their own educational
authorities responsible for education until May of this year, when Uganda
became a unitary state. Therefore, the Central Inspectorate in the Ministry
and the four Regional Inspectorates of the Central Government have been less
effective in those provinces. Since May a more effective administration has
been introduced.
3.04.    The Schools and Colleges Division in the Ministry is responsible for
the school organization in general and for the supply of teachers. It has a
planning unit which deals with such items as budget, statistics and school
construction. Recently the Ministry has established its own architectural
unit which works in collaboration with the National Housing Corporation and
private architectural firms.
3.05.    The Ministry's Finance and Establishment Division is efficient and
there seems to be good cooperation between it and the Ministry of Finance.
This also applies to collaboration between the planning unit in the Ministry
of Education and the Ministry of Economic Development and Planning, the latter
dealing with manpower projections.
3.06.   The secondary schools have Boards of Governors appointed or approved
by the Ministry. Their authority is defined by law. It includes maintenance
of schlool buildings, appointment of teachers and budget proposals. The
Ministry of Education, however, exercises considerable influence because
Ministry officials are often members of the Boards.
3.07.    Africans hold most posts in the central and regional education
administrations. The staff is understandably rather inexperienced but other-
wise qualified and competent and should be able to organize, direct and
supervise not only the present school system but also an expanded one.



Enrollment
3.08.    The past, present and projected enrollment in primary and secondary
education is shown in Annexes 3 and 4. Enrollment has increased considerably
from 368,000 in primary and 10,190 in secondary education in 1955 to 578,000
and 23,300 in 1965. Despite this rapid increase, only 44 percent of the
primary school age population was in school in 1965. The 2.5 percent of
Uganda's secondary school-age population attending secondary school is low
compared with many other countries as shown below for the 1960's (Table 3).
Table 3
Secondary level enrollment

Country                              school age population.
Ethiopia                                      1
Uganda                                        2.5
Tanzania                                      3
Kenya                                         3.5
Tunisia                                      14
Pakistan                                     19
Canada, Sweden, U.S.A.                       60-90
It is estimated that primary school enrollment by 1970 will have grown to
710,000 or 54 percent of the relevant age group and secondary school enroll-
ment to about 40,000 or 4 percent of the age group.
Primary Education
3.09.    The majority of primary schools are supported in part by the Central
Government.  More than 80 percent of them are, however, administered by
religious bodies under the supervision of local authorities. The average
school has 180 students. Thirty-five (35) students is the most common class
size. Both figures compare favorably with many developing countries. One-
third of the primary pupils are girls. The drop-out rate is considerable by
comparison with developed countries, but about average for countries in a
similar stage of development. Only one-third of those entering Primary 1 in
1957 passed the examinations six years later (Annex 5). In addition to this,
10 percent of the pupils are repeaters. Of the primary teachers, 85 to 90
percent are trained, which is an acceptable figure. Primary school children
pay, on average, a fee of 25 shillings per year.
3.10.    A new primary school syllabus designed to meet present day needs in
Uganda has been inaugurated.  English will be introduced in Primary 1 and
used as the medium of instruction from Primary 4 upwards. The supply of text-
books and stationery is better than in some developing countries although
modern teaching aids are missing.
3.11.    A steady qualitative improvement of primary education can be expected
with the new syllabus. The number of drop-outs should decrease and a sound
foundation laid for a successful expansion of secondary education.



-6-
General Secondary 3ducation
3.12.    Sixty-six grant-aided-/and 24 unaided schools offer general second-
ary education.   Enrollment in unaided schools is fairly small and is not
expected to rise. In 1965, 17,300 pupils were enrolled in aided schools
about one-fourth of the students were girls. Due to the conversion of 23
intermediate schools into secondary schools and the opening of a number of
Forms Si (the first year of secondary), an intake of 15 percent of those
finishing primary school was achieved in 1965 but will fall in succeeding
years as the output from the primary schools increases. A minimum intake
of 12 percent is estimated as the need to meet manpower requirements and
must be maintained for some years to come. There is, moreover, an unevenness
of opportunities between districts that necessitates movement of qualified
students from one district to another at each succeeding level of education.
There are, for example, three times as many secondary school places on a
population basis in Buganda, including Kampala, as in the western provinces.
3.13.    A substantial majority of secondary schools having been founded by
religious bodies, the locations were determined by factors other than those
which nowadays govern school planning. The schools are, however, generally
in populous areas. Of the students in general secondary schools, 75 percent
are Africans and the rest are Asians, except for a very tiny fraction of
Europeans.
3.14.    The religious organizations' desire to spread education has led to
the proliferation of small and uneconomic school units. The average school
has less than 300 pupils, a figure which, on economic grounds, can permit
only a purely academic program. Government has now decided that the schools
shall offer a wider range of subjects and, in the future, the minimum school
size will therefore be 420 students. The average class size of 30 students
makes possible a satisfactory utilization of classrooms and laboratories.
3.15.    The outlines of the curricula and syllabuses used are laid down by
the University of Cambridge Examination Syndicate. School leaving certifi-
cates are therefore widely recognized for purposes of selection for further
studies both locally and abroad or for employment but there is room for
improvement and adaptation to the needs of Uganda. A recent agreement to
set up an East African Examinations' Council will make it possible to design
curricula and syllabi more relevant to the Uganda situation.
3.16.    Between 60 and 70 percent of the students pass the leaving examina-
tions each year. This figure is low and indicates that a rise in the
general standard of secondary schools is needed (90 percent is a target in
many developed countries). It also indicates the need for a revision of the
examination system. The final examinations are regarded as so important
that the performance of students during term is often ignored. This over-
valuation of examinations not only increases the number of failures but also
governs the curricula in an unfavorable way.
1/       Twenty-three of these 66 schools are former intermediate schools
which, in 1965, were converted to secondary schools in provisional facilities.



-7-
3.17.      The 23 converted and several of the other 43 aided secondary
schools lack adequate classrooms,laboratories, workshops, and libraries. The
quality of dormitories and staff houses varies from school to school. The
stock of audiovisual teaching aids is inadequate.   There is a sufficient
supply of textbooks but not all are suited to African students. Although
British and East African book publishers produce textbooks for Uganda, there
is a shortage of authors with adequate knowledge of the country.
3.18.      For secondary level education, the average fee charged is 500
shillings per year, made up of 300 shillings for tuition and 200 shillings
for boarding. Annex 5 shows that there is a small drop-out in secondary
education, the main cause of which is financial and not academic.
3.19.      In 1964, 85 percent of the secondary school teachers were trained
but 80 percent were expatriates. In 1965, the staff increased by 200 teachers
but the number of those trained increased only by 40 which caused the per-
centage of trained teachers to fall to 70 percent. Such a level cannot be
accepted if an increase in both quantity and quality of education is desired.
The wages of the teaching staff are sufficient and should attract the required
number of qualified teachers when the university output permits sufficient
candidates.
3.20.      There are no problems for the secondary school leavers to find
employment or places in higher education. The output - in 1965, 2,500 from
the four-year course and 500 from the six-year course - has been small in
relation to the need.
3.21.      To improve the standard of secondary education, courses in prac-
tical subjects are to be introduced in all schools (para. 3.14).
Technical Secondary Education and Vocational Training
3.22.      Opportunities for secondary education exist in three farm schools,
five technical schools, Uganda Technical College and Uganda College of Com-
merce. There are a number of rural trade schools and home craft centers at
intermediate level. Experience with these latter schools has been dis-
appointing and they are, therefore, being abolished. Outside the system of
the Ministry of Education, a number of training courses and apprentice schemes
are run by various governmental departments and private agencies. Several
firms engage in some form of training programs for new recruits. Within the
public sector, courses are conducted by the Ministries of Works, Housing and
Labor, Health, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Community Development, etc.
(annual output 200-300). Opportunities for vocational education, however,
fall short of the demand for them. Existing technical schools are, therefore,
expanding and more farm schools are being established.
3.23.      The intake of technical schools will increase from 460 in 1965 to
550 in 1970 and the intake in farm schools from 220 to 680. The number of
places in technical schools will increase from 1,040 in 1965 to 1,530 in 1970
and in farm schools from 590 to 2,040.



-8-
3.24.      Uganda Technical College offers courses for technicians: enrollment
is to increase from 230 to 540 students. Uganda College of Commerce will
train by 1967 a minimum of 190 students in a two-year course in business
administration.
3.25.      Although technical secondary education is still regarded as a
second choice by most students aiming for more than primary education, the
number of applicants to vocational courses is in general higher than the
number of places. The present plan for development seems therefore to
strike a balance between the need for training and the supply of trainees.
Some technical schools and farm schools have poor facilities. On the whole,
however, these schools are better equipped than a majority of the new general
secondary schools.
Teacher Training
3.26.      Primary Teachers - Bold attempts are being made to meet the
challenge of teacher scarcity in Uganda. The modest expansion of primary
education from 44 percent of the age group in 1965 to 54 percent in 1970
is determined by the decision to have it geared to the supply of trained
teachers. There are two grades of teachers for the primary schools. The
lower grade teachers are recruited after an intermediate education, plus four
years of teacher training, Teachers at this level are produced in 26 mission-
founded colleges. Annual output is 850. Training for the higher grade pre-
pares teachers for the upper primary classes. Two-year courses are offered
in five colleges to students with School Certificate or to existing teachers -
the latter in this way being upgraded. Output is planned to increase from
210 to 900 per year. It has been decided that the training of primary school
teachers will be concentrated in four large colleges, and the entrance level
raised to School Certificate for all students. The production of primary
school teachers in Uganda should be sufficient to meet the needs created by
development and replacements.
3.27.      Secondary Teachers - The teaching staff in Uganda's general sec-
ondary schools numbered 930 in 1965 - 137 teachers were Africans, 212 Asians,
and 581 Europeans or Americans. Available data does not indicate whether
there are acute shortages of teachers in any specific subject. However, the
main reason given by the headmasters for the absence of practical subjects in
some schools was lack of specialist teachers. Hitherto, Uganda has drawn its
staff for the secondary schools from two sources. First, there are the
expatriate staff recruited from the United Kingdom, the United States Peace
Corps program, Norwegian Peace Corps Scheme, and other overseas countries.
Second, there is a growing supply of Ugandans. To date, the number of
Ugandans has been far from encouraging. As in other developing countries, a
substantial number of teachers has been called away from the teaching services
into other fields of activity, but it is expected that the competitive posi-
tion of teaching posts will improve as the supply of secondary graduates
increases.
3.28.      Local training for Uganda secondary school teachers is offered at
Makerere University College in a three-year course leading to a Bachelor of
Education degree. The number of Ugandans in this course is at present only
51 but is increasing.



-9-
3.29.      In addition to the training of teachers in Makerere College, there
is a teacher training institute at Kyambogo, Kampala, with an intake of 170
students in 1966. The entrants to its two- or three-year teacher training
courses hold School Certificates or Higher School Certificates, respectively.
In collaboration between the Kyambogo Teacher Training Institute and Uganda
Technical College a scheme to train teachers in industrial arts has been
developed. Home economics teachers have also been trained during the past
few years, but the training of teachers for commerce and agriculture has still
to be developed. Courses are also operating to upgrade primary teachers to
teach academic and practical subjects in secondary schools.
Educational Research
3.30.      The National Institute of Education is a corporate body bringing
together the Ministry of Education, the principals and staffs of teacher train-
ing colleges and the Faculty of Education at Makerere College in an effort to
improve and expand teacher and pupil education in Uganda. The Institute pro-
motes research, provides conferences and in-service courses for teachers,
revises curricula, textbooks and other teacher aids, and produces educational
TV programs. It has just started its activities but should in due course play
an important role in raising the quality of education in Uganda.
Higher Education
3.31.      Opportunities for higher education are available at Makerere College
in Kampala and also at other sections of the University of East Africa - in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. The Faculties at Makerere College
include Arts, Social Sciences, Sciences, Medicine, Agriculture, Education and
Fine Arts. In 1966, there were 940 Ugandan students pursuing various courses
at the University of East Africa, the majority of them in Kampala. In
addition, 2,250 students were studying overseas of whom 250 were taking
courses in education. The University of East Africa will expand considerably
during the coming decade to meet the estimated demand of first level manpower
(para. 4.06).
3.32.      Students graduating from the secondary schools and not proceeding to
higher education at the university level have also opportunities to enter post-
secondary courses given in the institutions mentioned in paras. 3.24 and 3.29.
Foreign Aid in Education
3.33.      Important grants and loans for school construction have been given
to Uganda by the U. S. Agency for International Development (U.S. AID) and
the British Ministry of Overseas Development. Uganda Technical College,
the Kyambogo Teacher Training Institute and 16 secondary schools have been
wholly or partially financed in this way. The British Ministry of Overseas
Development assists in the supply of about 450 secondary teachers. The
Teachers for East Africa Scheme and the U.S. Peace Corps have supplied 66
secondary teachers in 1965. Of the Uganda students studying overseas, 500
are on foreign scholarships.

4. THE FINANCING OF EDUCATION
Recurrent Expenditures
4.01.      A substantial part of Uganda's public expenditures is allocated to
education. The Central Government spent in 1965/66 15 percent, or L6.6 million
on education of a total recurrent expenditure of IT43.6 million (Annex 6).
4.02.      The Central Govermment bears the largest share of the cost of
education through the Ministry of Education and through the Ministry of
Regional Administration in all parts of Uganda ("block grants") and the
financial responsibility for secondary education lies almost completely with
it.
4.03.      However, the expenditure for educational purposes by Local Authori-
ties is also important and their contributions - excluding the block grants -
amount to about one-third of the total public recurrent expenditure on educa-
tion (Annex 6, page 2). The Local Authorities are mainly responsible from
their own resources for the non-salary recurrent expenditure of primary
education, while the block grants cover salaries of primary teachers.
4.04.      Other sources for local funds - aside from block grants and Local
Authorities' contributions - are contributions by voluntary agencies (par-
ticularly missions) and community self-help schemes. There is no information
available about the size of these contributions.
4.05.      The projections for the Second Five-Year Plan reveal that the
allocations for education will be increased to 20 percent of the total re-
current expenditure of 1,63.0 million in 1970/71. A budget surplus is pro-
jected, the creation of which will require substantial increases in taxation
(Annex 6).
4.06.      Annex 7 shows the increase in the projected total public recurrent
expenditure on education by sector during the Second Five-Year Plan. Aside
from the general increase from L8.0 million to L13.4 million, the expansion
on university level education from 1l.2 million to 12.7 million should be
noted. Large amounts of funds are channeled into top level education while
responsibility for primary education is to a large degree transferred to local
authorities.
4.07.      The planned expansion and improvement of education will cause an
appreciable increase in the recurrent cost per pupil (Annex 8). The increase
can be explained by the introduction of diversified curricula with new
subjects and new teaching equipment. A higher standard in teaching facilities,
kitchens, sanitation and dormitories will raise maintenance costs. Vocational
and practical courses and teacher training institutes are more expensive than
general education but the steep increase in cost in these fields is caused
mainly by the upgrading of vocational education and primary teacher training
from lower secondary to upper secondary level.

Capital Expenditures
4.o8.    Table 4 shows the development of Central Government capital expen-
diture over the past five-year period, including the present position.
The sharp decrease from 1964/5 to 1i65,/6 is due to major cuts in the budget
which were made necessary by a deterioration in the government financial
position.

The Local Authorities are responsible from their owm resources for some of
the capital costs in primary education, but no data is available about the
size of these contributions.
4.09.    The Second Five-Year Plan projects an educational investment of
L18.5 million, the bulk of which will go to secondary and higher education.
A part of the projected accumulated current account budget surplus of 1r30
million will assist the financing of the investments.   Other important
parts would be covered by the proposed IDA credit, and by a USAID loan
currently under consideration for teacher training colleges.   The Govern-
ment may also allocate a part of a U.K. loan of 16 million to education.
Table 5 shows the breakdown of the projected capital expenditure on
education including contributions from Local Authorities.

5. THE NEED FOR THE PROJECT
5.01.      Based on the survey of Uganda's stock of high level manpower carried
out in 1962/63, an overall manpower plan has been worked out by the Central
Planning Bureau. Five-year term projections of required manpower supply have
been made from 1966 to 1981, the target year when full Africanization is to
be achieved. These projected manpower requirements have been divided into
three levels:
First Level   - University graduates or equivalent;
Second Level  - Higher School Certificate holders or equivalent;
Third Level   - School Certificate holders or equivalent.
Annex 9 shows the manpower stock in 1966 and the projected manpower require-
ments in the period 1966-1981. The third level projections exclude primary
teachers due to the mixed composition of this group.
5.02.  -   The present stock of first, second and third level manpower,
17,600 - 6,000 of which are non-Africans, should be increased to 29,000 in
1972, an increase of 11,400. In 1981 there should be more than 65,000 first,
second and third level Africans - under the assumption of 100 percent
Africanization by then.
5.03.      Normal wastage, Africanization, the intake of higher schools includ-
ing primary teacher training institutes, dropouts and repeaters at various
levels necessitate a total output in the period of about 33,000 from sec-
ondary education to meet the demand for higher level manpower in 1972 and
a considerable expansion is therefore required. A part of this expansion
has been initiated by the conversion in 1965 of 23 existing intermediate



-13-
schools to secondary schools. However, these former intermediate schools do
not have enough classrooms. They lack also many other facilities including
dormitories and staff houses. All need an extensive construction program to
bring their facilities to an acceptable standard. In addition, several
existing secondary schools must be expanded and reconstructed.
5.04.      A qualitative improvement of the general secondary system is also
needed.  The number of failures in the-school leaving examinations is con-
siderable (para. 3.16), which indicates the demand for better teaching aids
and an improved curriculum. An outline has, therefore, been developed by
the Ministry of Education for a revised secondary school curriculum. break-
ing away from anarrow range of subjects in order to provide a comprehensive
program which will give the pupils a range-of-prgqtical courses in addition
to the normal academic subjects. Commercial-atudies, arts and crafts,
industrial arts and home economics have been included, to be taken at the
Cambridge School Certificate level. Agricultural subjects will also be
offered. At present very few schools are provided with the physical facili-
ties to cope with this broadening of the curriculum.
5.05.      The manpower analysis also shows that the teaching of science
subjects must be given increased emphasis. The objective should be a system
in which there are three science streams to two arts streams. The majority
of the present schools have no facilities to meet the increased demand for
science teaching.
6. THE PROJECT
6.01.      The request originally submitted by the government of Uganda to
IDA was for a loan of L10.6 million to convert 23 intermediate to secondary
schools and expand and upgrade 42 existing general secondary schools./but a
division of the proposed project into two phases wxas found desirable. The
expansion and upgrading of 26 existing schools has therefore been postponed
to a second phase of the education development program.
6.02.      The postponement will cause no considerable delay in the proposed
increase in student enrollment, but it means that these 26 schools will not
be able to offer science and practical courses to an extent desirable for
the time being. They should therefore form part of a second project to be
carried out soon after the completion of the first.
6.03.      The project would consist of:
(a) the construction of 24 new general secondary schools, 23 of
which are on sites that before 1965 were used for inter-
mediate education and one on a completely new site, to include
academic facilities, student hostels and staff houses;
2/         i.e., 65 of 66 schools mentioned in paragraph 3.12.



-14-
(b) the construction of additional facilities in approximately
15 existing general secondary schools, to include the items
mentioned under (a).
6.04.    The project would be implemented during 1967-1970 and the schools
in the project fully utilized in 1972.   About 13,900 new places would be
added by the project, including facilities for 2,100 students already
accepted in proviaional premises.   The project would increase the annual
output by a maximum of 3,800 students.   The total cost of the project
would be L5.1 million (US$14.3 million equivalent).   The foreign exchange
component is estimated at 13.2 million (US$3.4 million or 24 percent of
the total).
6.o5.    The proposed expansion of secondary education is a part of the
Second Five-Year Plan, where it is given great emphasis.   Taking into
account the proposed IDA Credit, the capital and recurrent expenditures
caused by the proposed project are within the financial capacity of the
Government.
Educational
6.06.    Annexes 3 and 10 show the projected enrollment in secondary
education in Uganda in the years 1966 to 1972.   The general secondary
school development allows for an increase in enrollment from 17,300 at
present to about 33,200 in 1972.   The project would provide about 90
percent of the new places.   All the schools in the project are for Forms
1 to 4 (School Certificate) with 121 streams adding about 12,900 new
plactds. Ten of the schools will, in addition, have facilities for Forms
5 and 6 (Higher School Certificate) with 20 streams and 1,000 new places.
6.07.     Of the 39 schools, 16 are co-educational, four are girls'
schools and 19 are boys' schools.   Ten schools are for the most part
day schools.   Twenty-nine schools are boarding schools with some day
students.   All schools will have 420-560 places each and their sizes
will be economically and educationally acceptable.   There will be
about 7,300 places in new dormitories.
6.o8.     In addition to academic subjects, all schools will offer
practical courses such as industrial arts, commerce, agriculture or
home economics and a considerable part of the project funds would be
used to construct facilities for practical courses, laboratories, lib-
raries and other special rooms for this purpose.   About two-thirds of
the streams for Forms 5 and 6 will be science streams.
Staff
6.09.     At present a majority of secondary school teachers are ex-
patriates and it will be necessary for Uganda to rely upon foreign teachers
for some years to come.   But the number of local teachers is increasing
(Annex 11) and it is hoped that, by 1972, 80 percent of the 1,680 teachers
needed in general secondary schools will be Africans.   This estimate is



based on projected output from the teacher training institutes in Uganda,
i.e., Makerere (20 p.a.) and Kyambogo (170 p.a.).   An additional source
of local teachers is to be found in the Ugandans studying education in
universities abroad of which there are currently 250.  As the United
Kingdom Government and the US Peace Corps are prepared to maintain or
slightly increase the present number of teaching posts filled by them
(500-550) and as there are other sources (para. 3.27), the qualified teacher
supply is expected to meet the demands of the project.
Student Hostels and Staff Housing
6.10.     As will be observed in Table 6, paragraph 6.24, it has been
necessary to make a substantial allocation of funds for student hostels
(19 percent of proiect cost) and staff housing (19 percent).   The problem
is not peculiar to Uganda, although the population distribution in Uganda
makes it particularly acute.   Ninety-six percent of the population in
Uganda live in rural areas.   Although many rural districts have a fairly
high population density, there is very little concentration of this popula-
tion in organized centers.   For example, the 1959 census shows only 12
towns with a population over 4,000, of which only 5 have a population over
10,000.   Public transportation services are generally non-existent or
primitive.   According to a study made by a United Nations team, this low
degree of urbanization will continue for many years to come and urbaniza-
tion of less than 20 percent is estimated at the end of the century
which would be a very low figure compared with the world average.
6.11.     The education plan aims to provide secondary education for areas
not hitherto served, which implies that rural schools serving wide catch-
ment areas will form an important part of the expanded school system.   The
distribution pattern of the schools in the proposed project coincides
indeed with the main areas of population (map) but the conventional
structure in developed countries of a widespread system of day schools is
not yet achievable.  Population growth in the immediate vicinity of the
rural centers where the schools have been located and the development of
roads and transport services will permit a growing percentage of the
students to attend as day students.   However, considering that the
percentage of secondary school students is only 2.5 of the appropriate
age group, that the project will increase this figure only to 4.0, and
that these students are to be drawn from the country as a whole, the
majority of the pupils wfill ha-ve to be boarders and reliance on hostel facili-
ties is inescapable.
6.12.     During the appraisal, particular attention was paid to merits and
disadvantages involved in increasing the percentage of day students and
decreasing the number of residential places by the adoption of school bus
service.   Taking all factors into account, including catchment areas of
buses - which are restricted by the conditions of the roads - and avail-
ability of drivers and mechanics, there does not appear to be justification
for insisting upon the adoption of bus services as a condition of the
Credit.   Given the very small number of schools in Uganda at this time,



-16-
any substantial shift to day schools would result in a higher ratio of
educational opportunity for students in the immediate vicinity at the
expense of students in the country as a whole.   This would conflict directly
with the Government policy of offering opportunities selectively, but
equitably, throughout the country on a merit basis.
6.13.     In the future as both the number of schools and urbanization
increase and the transportation system improves, a shift to day schools will
be feasible, and future plans for school expansion should take this into
account.   This has been brought to the attention of the Uganda authorities.
As an interim solution, it has been agreed that hostel space in the project
will be designed so as to be convertible later on into classrooms and other
instructional facilities.
6.14.     The previously described extension of secondary education to areas
not hitherto served increases the present housing problem for the teaching
staff.   Even in cities like Kampala an acute housing shortage exists and no
significant private rental market has yet been created.   Outside Kampala
and a few other places, private housing of a minimum standard appropriate
to professional employees is non-existent.   Therefore, the provision of
housing forms a part of the salary in all governmental and most private
activities.   The alternative employment opportunities for persons with
secondary teacher qualifications are so numerous that not to offer housing -
particularly in areas which offer very few other amenities - would seriously
jeopardize the possibility of recruiting the necessary teachers.   The only
realistic way to assure that the schools in the proposed project will be
provided with a sufficient number of teachers - Africans or expatriates -
is therefore to include the construction of a certain amount of staff
housing.   As shown in paragraph 6.20, the allocation of funds for staff
housing has been kept to a minimum essential to meet this need.
Physical
Location of Sites
6.15.     The Government or Local Authorities own the land for nine schools;
the land of the remaining 30 schools is owned by religious bodies.   In
most cases the size of the land is beyond the required space of about 30
acres per school.
6.16.     As the Government does not intend to buy the required land,
agreements have been signed with the religious bodies that the land and
the buildings to be erected will be used for the specified educational
purposes only.   The land necessary for the construction will be provided
without cost to the project.
Educational and General Service Facilities, and Hostels
6.17.     Classrooms-and laboratories are designed for classes of 35-40 at
the level of Forms 1-4 and 30 in Forms 5 and 6. These are accepted sizes
from both the education and economic points of view.



-17-
6.18.     Each school will have a library which can also serve for teaching
purposes, and either commercial, agricultural, or home economics units are to
be provided, as well as shops for industrial arts. The educational equipment
for classrooms, laboratories and workshops would be supplied according to
standard lists which are suitable in content and reasonable in cost. Dining
halls would be provided for two-shift meals and would also serve as assembly
halls.
6.19.     The hostels would be designed for double bunks and the area per
student would be the minimum allowed according to the health regulations.
There will be no common rooms. Some schools in the project already have
hostels. The government of Uganda has agreed to utilize the existing hostels
in the same way as the new ones.
Staff Houses
6.20.     The proportion of married and unmarried staff is about equal at the
present time in Uganda. Married staff would be provided with a three-bedroom
house; whereas three unmarried staff members would be required to share one
house. This arrangement gives flexibility for the changing requirements of
married and unmarried staff and implies a maximum of utilization of the
facilities in the long run. It is also a more economical solution from a
construction point of view, as it would be more expensive to provide bachelor
quarters. The staff house would have living room, kitchen and one bathroom
in addition to the three bedrooms. There would be no servants' quarters.
The agreed standard of the houses is the minimum appropriate to recruit staff.
6.21.     The project schools require about 800 teachers for whom housing
must be provided.  If the already existing and the new staff housing is
utilized according to the above-mentioned arrangement, a total sum  of US$2.4
million would be required to construct about 260 houses for the teaching staff
and matrons. This represents about 19 percent of the total project cost.
Costs
Construction
6.22.     The construction cost estimates for the proposed project are derived
from costs of building per square foot, based on standard designs and recent
building experience and the effect of intemrational competition has also been
taken into consideration. For each type of structure, recent costs were
adjusted to account for modifications that are to be included in the new
plans. For secondary school construction in Uganda, the cost of materials
generally accounts for approximately 60 percent of the total cost.
6.23.     Building designs would be based on a series of standard type plans
and specifications prepared for each of the building types by the project
unit of the Ministry of Education. The design is economic and acceptable
and construction costs are reasonable. For each type of facility to be pro-
vided, acceptable standard lists of furniture and equipment have been
prepared.

6.24.     Table 6 gives a breakdown of the major categories of expenditure
in the project by function. The figures for academic buildings and general
service, student hostels and staff housing include furniture and equipment.
In determining the contingency it is recognized that the downward effect
of international bidding may be offset somewhat by the increased volume of
construction activity resulting from the project (paras. 6.31, 6.32). An -
allowance of 15 percent of the cost should be sufficient to cover unantici-
pated construction and site planning problems as well as price increases.

Foreign Exchange Components
6.25.     The foreign exchange component amounts to US$3.4 million equivalent
or 24 percent overall, including equipment and furniture. Imported con-
struction materials form about 15 percent of the construction costs. The
items which are usually imported are: structural and reinforced steel, con-
crete drain pipe, sanitary and electrical fixtures and glazing. The general
procedure for the importation of building materials is for the contractor
to order them through local material suppliers who, in turn, do the actual
importing.
6.26.     The most commonly used school furniture is made of wood and tubular
metal. While the metal must be imported, the wood used is local and all the
furniture is manufactured in Uganda. About 25 percent of the cost of furni-
ture is foreign exchange.
6.27.     Practically all specialized instructional equipment is imported
from overseas. Normally the orders are placed by the Ministry of Education
through the Chief Supplies Officer of the Ministry of Works.
Building Construction
Standard and Maintenance
6.28.     In comparison with other developing countries, architectural design
and building construction is of average standard. Some good quality of
construction is to be seen in the Kampala area whereas in the rural areas



-19-
the standards are lower. Economic considerations are stressed in the
architectural design but not sufficient consideration has until now been
given to building materials or climatic conditions.
6.29.     The maintenance of non-government schools is the responsibility of
the School Board in compliance with public health rules. In the case of
government schools, the responsibility rests with the Ministry of Works.
Funds for routine repairs and maintenance of school buildings and replace-
ment of capital equipment (other than buildings), are normally budgeted in
the recurrent income and expenditure of the school and appear to be adequate.
Major repairs to school buildings are considered for capital grants from the
Ministry of Education and work is carried out by a private contractor for
the School Board.
Professional Services
6.30.     The IMinistry of Education has its own architectural section which
works in collaboration with the Ministry of Works. For the purpose of this
project, the two government offices will be assisted by the employment of
private architectural firms. As there are well-qualified and experienced
firms available in East Africa, the professional services, including quantity
surveying and engineering, are adequate.
Activity of the Building Industry
6.31.     The output of the construction industry represents a comparatively
small part of the economy - about 3 percent (para. 2.09). In recent years
total building activity has dropped considerably, but prices have remained
fairly stable and are still appreciably higher than in the neighboring
country of Kenya. The main reason for this is the lack of competition in the
building industry.
6.32.     With the originally proposed project the strain on the current
annual output would have been beyond the capacity of the building industry.
Expenditure on the project as now proposed will be in the region of US$5
million equivalent in the first year of construction. Even this sum will
have a considerable impact, particularly on the small, local contractors
since it represents about 30 percent of the current total annual volume of
the building industry.
Contracting Firms
6.33.     At present there are about 40 building contractors.  The twelve
largest firms employ approximately 75 percent of the total labor force in
the building industry which is at present estimated at about 8,000. The
remaining 25 percent is employed by the smaller firms.
6.34.     There are a number of foreign-based contracting firms, which do
work and maintain offices in Uganda. Six of them are Kenya firms; three are
British; and one is an international company.



-20-
6.35.    For the purpose of this project, an assessment of the work capacity
of the building contractors will be made by the architectural unit of the
Ministry of Education in collaboration with the National Housing Corporation.
Tendering and Contract Awards
6.36.     Since January 1965, tendering for all government building projects
has been administered by a Central Tender Board in the Ministry of Finance.
The Tender Board does not bind itself to accept the lowest bid, but normally,
the lowest qualified bidder receives the award of the contract.
6.37.     Insurance of the construction work against fire and against per-
sonal injuries is the responsibility of the contractor. The contractor will
also be required to post a bond as a guarantee against his failure to complete
the work.
6.38.     All contracts, including those for furniture and equipment, will be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding.
The Implementation of the Project
6.39.     A special project unit has been established within the Ministry of
Education. This unit consists of an educator to supervise execution of the
project, two architects and supporting technical and secretarial staff, all
full time. This unit will design new standard plans and working drawings in
cooperation with private architectural firms. The Minister of Education has
agreed to train one or more Africans in this project unit.
6.40.     In order to adapt the standard drawings to the individual school
sites, qualified and experienced firms of architects will be employed to under-
take the architectural and engineering services required. In this connection,
the larger firms have agreed to train Africans during the execution of the
project.
6.41.     The project unit will coordinate the design and supervision between
the architectural firms and the Ministry of Works. The various other ministries
participating in the project will appoint representatives with whom the project
unit will maintain close contact in order to ensure coordination and inter-
change of information.
6.42.     The preparation period will be one year, the construction period three
years and the defects and liability period nine months, during which time the
disbursement rate is expected to be 4, 35, 31, 28 and 2 percent (Annex 13).
Mechanics of Disbursement
6.43.     Disbursements would be made against authorized vouchers presented to
IDA. With an IDA credit of US$10 million equivalent total disbursements would
cover about 70 percent of the total cost of the project, and disbursements
would amount to 70 percent of the vouchers. This percentage would be varied
as a result of any changes in the estimated total cost of the project, subject
to the proviso that such percentage could not exceed 100 percent.

7.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOiVMENDATIONS
7.01.     During the period 1966-1972 Uganda's requirements for high-level
manpower call for 11,400 persons taking up new positions. Over the same
period Africanization of part of the present stock of 17,600 job holders is
aimed at (para. 5.02). Enrollment in secondary education is low compared
with many other developing countries (para. 3.08). Existing secondary school
facilities are not adequate to meet the estimated manpower need and a major
expansion is called for (para. 5.03).
7.02.     The proposed project would increase the annual output from general
secondary education by 3,800 places and help to meet projected manpower
demands in the 1970's. It would also raise the general standard of the sec-
ondary schools and broaden the curriculum by adding science subjects and
practical courses (paras. a.06-6.07.
7.03.     Some Uganda students would have to be provided residential faci-
lities and the project would therefore provide the students with dormitories
which can, however, be converted into classrooms in the future (paras. 6.11,
6.13). A number of staff houses must be constructed (para. 6.14).
7.04.     Primary education will form a sound base for an expanded secondary
education (para. 3.11).
7.05.     There is a shortage of local secondary school teachers in Uganda.
However, the local supply is increasing and is hoped to reach 80 percent of
the requirement by 1972. Meanwhile, the prospect of recruiting additional
expatriate teachers is favorable (para. 6.09).
7.06.     The capital and recurrent expenditures caused by the proposed pro-
ject are within the financial capacity of the government (para. 6.05).
7.07.     International competitive bidding will be used for furniture, equip-
ment and buildings. It is expected to have a noticeable effect on the rather
high and stable building prices hitherto prevailing in Uganda (para. 6.31).
7.08.     Standard designs of acceptable estimated cost would be used for
school construction (para. 6.39).
7.09.     The equipment to be procured is adequate and reasonable in cost
(para. 6.18).
7.10.     Satisfactory assurances have been obtained during negotiations that
the following actions will be taken by the government:
i. Investigation of examination procedures and content of the sec-
ondary school curriculum in an effort to adjust them to the
needs of Uganda and to decrease the nu*mber of failures (paras.
3.16, 5.04).



-22-
ii. Investigation of the possibilities of a gradual transfer to a
day-school system as urbanization increases and improved
transportation can be offered (para. 6.13).
iii. Formulation of schemes to train secondary teachers for practical
subjects as offered in the syllabus (para. 3.29).
iv. Location and construction of student hostels in such a way that
they can be converted into classrooms or other teaching facili-
ties when necessary (para. 6.13).
7.11.     As conditions for the granting of the Credit, the government has
taken the following actions:
i. Signed agreements with the Religious Bodies concerned that the
land and the buildings to be erected under the project will be
used for the specified educational purposes only (para. 6.16).
ii. Set up in the Ministry of Education a project unit for the
execution of the project, consisting of a project director, two
experienced architects and adequate secretarial and techmical
supporting staff (para. 6.39).
7.12.     The project forms a suitable basis for the proposed IDA Credit of
US$10 million equivalent or about 70 percent of the project cost of US$14.3
million equivalent. This would cover foreign exchange costs estimated at
US$3-4 million equivalent and US$6.6 million equivalent of the local currency
costs, leaving US$4.3 million equivalent to be financed by the government of
Uganda.
