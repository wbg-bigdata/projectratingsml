produc.ts, furniture and wood products, and wearing apparel. Within these
subsectors, about half of SMI activity is concentrated in two areas, food
processing and chemicals.
ii.      During the implementation period of Loan 1727-Ph, the Government
operated a number of specialized loan programs channeled through financial
institutions to hel.p SMI firms with entrepreneurial and management skills but
short of capital. Pre-eminent among these programs was the Central Bank's
Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund (IGLF) to which the bulk of Loan 1727-PH
funds were extended. Other programs directing credit to SKI firms during the
project period included the Development Bank of the Philippines' Small and
Medium Industries Lend3ng (SMILE) Program, the agri-business loan programs of
both the Central Bank (CB) and Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), the
Philippine National Bank's Small and Medium Scale Industries Financing Scheme
and the Kapisanang Kabuhayan at Kaunlaran (KKK). Most of the programis (other
than IGLF) have in the past few years been discontinued or sharply curtailed.
iii.     The Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund (IGLF), created in 1952, is a
rediscount and guarantee mechanism operated by the Central Bank (CB) under
which term loans (fixed asset and permanent working capital) made to eligible
SMI firms by accredited financial institutions (commercial banks, rural and
thrift banks, private development banks and nonbank financial institutions)
are rediscounted. IGLF also offers guarantees to cover credit and collateral
short risks taken by the participating financial institutions (PFIs) on IGLF
rediscounted loans. IGLF has sourced its funds primarily from funds
transferred from the Government budget and from World Bank borrowings.
iv.      The Second Small and Medium Industries Development Project is a
follow-on project from ShI I (Loan 1120-PH). Under that loan, the Bank for
the first time lent for funding the IGLF and, in the context of the loan, made
major changes to an on-going program. Specifically, under SMI I, IGLF
implemented the accreditation prog& m under which financial institutions were
approved for participation and eligible for IGLF rediscounting of loans to SMI
firms. The reformulated IGLF program expanded under both SMI I and II with
the infusion of IBRD loans and Go%ernment counterpart funds.



Proiect Obiectives and Goals
v.       An important objective of the project was to ensure that long-term
resources were available for the long-term financing needs of both the small
and medium scale industry sectors. In this regard IGLF was to be a vehicle
for providing _mloyuent opportunities. improving income distribution and
regional developmes.t, and a catalyst for promoting general economic growth and
exports. It was also Intended to expand and upgrade the network of financial
institutions through vhich IGLF's credit was provided, and in particular to
promote expertise in project evaluation and preparation.
Project Description
vi.      The loan consisted of two parts: (a) the financing of the Industrial
Guarantee and Loan Fund (IGLF) for on-lending through accredited institutions
to SMI for fixed assets and permanent working capital; and (b) the
strengthening of the Department of Industry's Medium and Small Industries
Coordinated Action Program (MASICAP) in providing assistance to entrepreneurs
in project preparation. All but 22 of the loan proceeds were allocated for
the IGLF financing.
Overall Operations
vii.    T?e objec ives of the project were largely fulfilled.  Loan 1727-PH
was disbursed qui(,ly, with the IGLF component of the loan ($24.5 million of
the total $25.0 million) being fully utilized within two years of loan
effectiveness. The loan was used to finance 264 IGLF-funded projects with an
average subloan size of P 1.0 million. The fast rate of disbursement was due
to the rclatively long maturities offerea by IGLF, the active participation of
an increajed number of accredited financing institutions, the inclusion of
medium scale industry under the IGLF eligibility criteria, the low interest
rates charged by IGLF and the increase in spreads allowed the PFIs (increased
from 72 to 82 for small industry loans and from 52 to 6? for medium industry
loans). Disbursements under the MASICAP component ($0.5 million) were slower
than anticipated because of (i) the merger of the Small Business Advisory
Centers (SBAC) and MASICAP programs; (ii) a Government-imposed freeze on
hiring by Ministries; (iii) bureaucratic disbursement procedures between
Ministries; and (iv) Government-issued procurement guidelines which restricted
the purchase of vehicles and computers. $84,465.33 originally allocated to
the MASICAP technical assistance program was cancelled effective July 8, 1983.
IGLF Operations
viii.    The loan enabled the lGLF program, which already was operating well,
to expand and improve its successful performance. The loan clearly fulfilled
its primary objective of channeling long-term funds to the SMI sector. By
1984, IGLF had become such an important source of term finance for SMI firms
in the Philippines that it represented 62 of all long-term loanb outstanding
in the country. When compared to the SMI share (21?) of value added in
manufacturing, it is evident that IGLF represented a substa,itial portion of
long-term credit extended to SMI in the industrial sector. During the
implementation period of Loan 1727-PH, the IGLF expanded to finance medium



- vi -
scale firms. Loans approved increased by almost 50Z a year (242 in real
term.), from 1 47 million in 1978 to P 435 million in 1984, with projects
financed by those loans generating about 10,497 new jobs.
iX.      The project also realized its goal of expandAng and upgrading the
network of financial institutions through which IGLV cLedit was provided, and
specifically of helping the institutions develop expertise in project
*valuation and preparation. By December 31, 1981, 32 financial institutions
were accredited under IGLF, as compared to 20 accredited institutions at the
time of the 1978 project appraisal. Training pregrams organized by IGLF for
PFI staff helped to upgrade appraisal and supervision capabilities of the
financial institutions. The resulting improvements in portfolio performance
during the project period can be seen in the collection ratios between
participating financing institutions and end-lasers, which improved steadily
and substantially between 1978 and 1984. Whereas in 1978 collections had
amounted to only about 171 of principal and interest falling due and past due,
they had improved to 542 by 1984. The proportion of PFI portfolios affected
by arrears from end users decreased substantially from 42Z by amount and 51Z
by number in 1978 to 122 by amount and 222 by number in 1984. At year end
1984, arrears amounted to only 4.52 of all IGLE' loans outstanding, and were
even lower (3.5Z) for institutions participating in the program under the
accreditation scheme. In addition, collection performance between
participating institutions and IGLF improved substantially. Loan arrears to
IGLF in 1978 represented 162 of the loan portfolio while in 1984 arrears
accounted for only 2.12 of the portfolio. The introduction of the
accreditation scheme (under SMI I), the increase in average subloan size with
the new eligibility of medium-scale industry (under SMI II) and the increased
attention to training, all contributed to the better results.
X.       The one explicit project objective that was not fulfilled under the
loan was channeling of a majority of project funds outside Metro-Manila. The
proportion of project funds lent to the regions was significantly lower than
expected (392 vs 60Z), with Metro-Manila absorbing a greater than anticinated
share of the total IGLF credit. The failure to achieve the desired regional
disbursement is due largely to the fact that most SMI firms are located near
Manila, which is the country's major port and largest consumer market ind has
easy access to communication and transportation. The proportion of subloans
that went to the regions was similar to the 1983 share of value added in the
SMI industrial sector originating in the regions (42?).
xi.      Organization.  IGLF was reorganized during the project period.  In
1979, there were only two divisions involved in IGLF operations--the Induc-
trial Loans Division and the IGLF Accouiting, Securities Control and Collec-
tion Division--and the total personnel complement of the organization was 48
people. With the approval of 18 new positions for IGLF by the Monetary Board
of the Central Bank, the IGLF organizational structure was reorganized into
four divisions, as follows: (a) the Industrial Projects Division, responsible
for processing IGLF financing applications, guarantees, and requests for
deferment or restructuring; (b) the IGLF Examination Division, responsible for
evaluating potential institutions for accreditation, for reviewing already
accredited institutions, and for performing end-use verification surveys of
projects assisted; (c) the IGLF Accounting, Securities Control and Collection
Division, which handles the accounting, securities control and collection



- vii -
functions of IGLF; and (d) the IGLF Special Studies Staff, which handles
research and technical information activities and various reporting
requirements.
xii.     Trainins.  Because of the clear importance within both IGLF and the
PFIs of analyzing credit risk and assessing projects and institutions, IGLF
initiated a number of programs under Loan 1727-PH to further develop the
experience of its staff and that of the PFIs. In addition, the staff of IGLF
and the PFIs participated in relevant local training programs and traveled
abroad to acquire additional knowledge on small enterpr4se financing and
related fields.
Lessons to be Learned
xiii.    Several lessons which may be learned from the Bank's and IGLF's
experiences under Loan 1727-PH are outlined below:
(a)  There are inherent difficulties in pricing subloans to fully reflect
all costs, including risk of potential foreiga exchange losses, in
economies with regulated interest rates. At the outset of SMI II,
IGLF funds to the PFIs were priced at an average rate of 8.6Z, which
was 0.7Z higher than the 7.92 interest rate charged by the Bank on
Loan 1727-PH. While this spread enabled World Bank financed projects
to contribute to IGLF's administrative costs, it did not provide a
premium to cover the foreign exchange risk on the World Bank loan.
When the peso was devalued after disbursement of the loan (declining
from an average disbursement rate of P 7.7 to the dollar, to the mid-
1988 rate of P 21.0 to the dollar), the Government was left with a
large foreign exchange loss towards which the accredited financial
institutions and SMI borrowers had made no contribution. Experience
with the loan indicates that loans to apex institutions for onlending
in regulated financial sectors should be tied to policy reform and
deregulation of the financial sector. Once financial markets are
deregulated and interest rates reflect expected inflation and foreign
exchange adjustments, then apex program lerding rates (to both
participating financial institutions and end-users) should be market-
based. Such a rate should reflect the premium for foreign exchange
as perceived by the market and should provide adequate cover to the
Government.  A proposed 4th SMI World Bank loan to the Philippines
takes these recommendations into account.
(b)  During the implementation period of Loan 1727-PH. IGLF did not limit
the participation of individual financial institutions in order to
ensure that the IGLF portfolio as a whol. was balanced or
diversified.  The weakened financial situation of some of the PFIs
during 1980 to 1984 period suggests that this failure to diversify
was unwise. In 1981, after the bankruptcy of one PFI holding a large
portion of the IGLF portfolio, IGLF adopted a policy limiting the
participation of individual PFIs and specifying that a PFI's



- vili -
portfolio of IGLF rediscounted loans may not exceed that
institution's total net worth.
(c)  The experience of IGLF under Loan 1727-PH suggests that the apex
arrangements which are appropriate for lending to small and medium
firms may be inappropriate for effectively reaching cottage firms.
IGLF's record vith cottage industry during the project period showed
poor repayment and suggested that making and supervising cottage
industry loans was overly cumbersome and expensive for the financial
institutions participating in the IGLF program. The data suggest
that a different vehicle for financing cottage industry should be
created and that IGLF should not be pushed to fill the financing gap
to that sector.

INDUSTRIAL GUARANTEE AND LOAN FUND
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT - LOAN 1727-PH
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      This Project Completion Report (PCR) on Loan 1727-PH (Loan Agreement
dated June 27, 1979) reflects the utilization of that loan for strengthening
and expanding the IGLF lending facility to small and medium industries and for
an SHI technical assistance component. The IGLF component amounted to $24.5
million of the total IBRD loan of $25.0 million, extended to the Republic of
the Philippines. The remaining $0.5 million represented a technical assis-
tance program to strengthen the Medium and Small Industries Coordinated Action
Program (MASICAP), a Department of Industry program Intending to stimulate
investment in small and medium industries in regions outside Metro-Manila.
Loan 1727-PH was the Bank's second loan to IGLF and accordingly this is the
second completion report on lending to that institution. To date, IGLF has
received three loans from the World Bank totaling US$99.5 million; the third
loan of US$63.0 million was made on June 30, 1982. Information on the three
loans is given below. A fourth SMI project, which would include an IGLF
component of approximately $60 million, is currently under consideration.

1.2      The basic data concerning Loan 1727-PH are presented in the introduc-
tory basic data shorts. Specific data for the IGLF portion of the loan (98?
of the total) are as follows:
Loan amount                           US$24.5 million
Maximum subloan size                  1 2.5 million
Free limit                            No required prior
review; subloans
over P500,000 were
to be reviewed on a
post-approval basis
Start of implementation               February 1, 1980
Date of full utilization of           September 10, 1981
IGLF portion of the loan
1.3      Although the fourth SMI project, currently under consideration, is
expected to include funding from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and possibly
the ASEAN Japan Development Fund (AJDF), IGLF previously depended solely on
the World Bank in raising funds from foreign sources. The IBRD loans were
made to the Government of the Philippines, which bore the full foreign
exchange risk. Under Loans 1120-PH and 1727-PH, the World Bank reimbursed 75?
of the total loans released and the remaining 25Z came from the counterpart
funds contributed by the Philippine Government. For Loan 2169-PH, 60? was
reimbursed by the World Bank and 40Z came from the Philippine Government.
1.4      The following data base and approach was used in drafting this PCR:
(a) The time period 1978 (the appraisal year) through 1984 was chosen as
the key period for assessing results of the loan. Although the loan
clo ed in 1983, results of subloans made prior to 1983 were felt
after the closing date and are reflected in IGLF's information for
1984. While the nature of the IGLF program has not changed substan-
tially since the closing of Loan 1727-PH, some alterations were
instituted under SMI III so that data after 1984 would be less
relevant to an analysis of SMI II. This PCR focuses largely on the
1978-84 time period but draws implications for subsequent years.
(b) For the implementation period of the loan, data on all IGLF subpro-
jects were analyzed, even though some of the projects fmnded by IGLF
during the period were not financed by the World Bank but rather
through internal IGLF or Government counterpart funds.   The informa-
tion assessed and presented reveals the overall health and contribu-
tion of the IGLF program.
(c) In conRidering the allocation of loan proceeds, a full listing of the
264 sub-projects financed by the loan was made (see Annex 3) and
analyzed. Releases to firms were evaluated against the objectives of
the loan.



- 3 -
(d)  IGLF staff collected and analyzed detailed data on a representative
sample of projects constituting about 291 of the total loans
released. The diverse group of sample projects was chosen after
consideration of industry and regional classification, size and
purpose of the loans, and sponsoring financial institutions.
II. THE SMI SECTOR
2.1      The Small and Medium Induszry (SMI) Sector in the Philippines is an
important contributor to the manufacturing sector, accounting for 21? of
value-added and 432 of employment in 1983. SMI firms are important in a wide
range of manufacturing subsectors contributing over 30? of value added in food
processing, machinery and equipment, chemicals, rubber, printing, plastic
products, furniture and wood products, and wearing apparel. Within these
subsectors, about half of SMI activity i3 concentrated in two areas, food
processing and chemicals.
2.2      The Government included the promotion of SMI as one of its major
industrial objectives in the 1978-1982 Five-Year Development Plan. During the
implementation of Loan 1727-PH, various Government agencies, including the
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), the National Economic and Development
Authority (NEDA), the Department of Finance, and the University of the
P ilippines' Institute for Small-Scale Industries (UP-ISSI), coordinated their
efrorts to help change the policy environment in the Philippines to promote
SHI growth. They initiated efforts to abolish inappropriate cottage industry
incentives, restructure BOI incentives, and increase the registration of SMI
firms for incentives. Also, the Government sponsored a range of technical
assistance and training programs for SMI firms.
2.3      In addition, the Government operated a number of specialized loan
programs channeled through financial institutions to help individuals or firms
with entrepreneurial and management skills but short of capital. Pre-eminent
among these programs was the Central Bank's Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund
(IGLF) to which the bulk of Loan 1727-PH funds were extended. Other programs
dira;cting credit to SHI firms during the project period included the
Development Bank of the Philippines' Small and Medium Industries Lending
(SMiILE) Program, the agri-business Loan programs of both the CB and DBP, the
Philippine National Bank's Small and Medium Scale Industries Financing Scheme
and the Kapisanang Kabuhayan at Kaunlaran (KKK).
III. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
3.1      The Second Small and Medium Industries Development Project is m
follow-on project from SMI I (Loan 1120-PH). Under that loan, the Bank for
the first time lent for funding the Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund (IGLF)
and, ir the context of the loan, made major changes to an on-going program.
Specifically, under SMI I, IGLF implemented the accreditation program under
which financial institutions were approved for participation and eligible for
IGLF rediscounting of loans to SMI firms. The reformulated IGLF program
expanded under SMI I with the infusion of IBRD loans and Government



-4-
counterpart funds. Loan 1727-PH continued this financing and facilitated the
rapid expansion of the program which occurred between 1979 and 1984. A Bank
mission visited the Philippines in June 1976 to identify the SMI II project.
The Bank pre-appraisal mission visited the Philippines in June 1978. The
project was appraised in November/December 1978. Negotiations were held the
week of April 23, 1979 and the loan was approved by the Bank Board on June 12,
1979. The Loan Agreement was signed on June 27, 1979 and became effective on
November 9, 1979.
3.2      The Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund (IGLF) was created in 1952 for
the purpose of encouraging the establishment and expansion of economically
sound SMIs that would contribute to the Philippines' economic development and
to a more equitable distribution of income among the people. IGLF is a
rediscount and guarantee mechanism operated by the Central Bank (CB) under
which term loans (for fixed assets and permanent working capital) made by
accredited financial institutions (commercial banks, rural and thrift banks,
private development banks and nonbank financial institutions) are
rediscounted. IGLF also offers guarantees to cover credit and collateral
short risks taken by the participating financial institutions (PFIs) on IGLF
rediscounted loans. IGLF has sourced its funds primarily from funds
transferred from the Government budget and from World Bank borrowings.
3.3      IGLF is owned by the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)
and administered by the Department of Loans and Credit (DLC) of the Central
Bank of the Philippines (CB). The fact that IGLF operates as an apex unit,
with the basic objective of providing resources to financial institutions for
onlending to SMI, enables the program to have a wide geographical reach, since
many of the institutions have an extensive regional branch network. Decisions
on policy issues affecting IGLF's operations are made by an interagency Review
Committee (RC) which includes representatives from NEDA, CB, Departme-t of
Ttade anc Industry (DTI), Department of Finance (DOF) and UP-ISSI.
3.4      Under the IGLF accreditation scheme implemented in 1976 under SMI I,
IGLF approves participation in the program of specific financial institutions
and then delegates all subloan appraisa' and supervision responsibilities to
those accredited financial institutions. Before granting accreditation
status, IGLF undertakes a thorough review of the institution to determine its
overall financial viability and the adequacy of its staff to implement an SMI
lending program. The performance of each accredited institution is reviewed
annually by IGLF and the Bank is informed of the findings of these reviews.
3.5      Although only accredited institutions are eligible for Bank funding,
IGLF also has a 3mall sponsorship program for rural banks, under which it
becomes more actively involved in the credit evaluation of the end-user.
While the participating financial institutions under the sponsorship scheme do
take the credit risk, their inadequate analytical capabilities necessitate a
detailed review of the subloans by IGLF staff prior to rediscounting. Since
the rural banks would not otherwise qualify for the IGLF program, the sponsor-
ship scheme enables IGLF to promote industrial growth outside metro-Manila and
to contribute to development in rural areas. The Aponsorship scheme has not
been financed by the World Bank under any of its projects, including SMI II.



- 5 -
3.6      The participating financial institutions (PFIs) are free to select
their own projects for financing, with IGLF financing assured if the project
meets broad eligibility criteria (appropriate asset size, acceptable financial
position and credit-rating, etc.). Full repayment rests with the financial
institution unless the loan also carries an IGLk guarantee. Accordingly, the
risk to IGLF is limited to insolvency or inability to repay by the participat-
ing financial institution. Default by the end-user is borne by the PFI and
not by IG_F.
Proiect Obiectives
3.7      IGLF operates with the basic objective of providing resources to
participating financial institutions for relending to SMIs. In this regard an
important objective of the project was to ensure that long-term resources were
available for inv-stment financing needs of both the small and medium scale
industry sectors. Under the project, IGLF was intended by the Government and
the Bank to be a vehicle for developing the SMI sector and thereby providing
employment opportunities, improving income distribution and regional
development, and providing a catalyst for promoting general economic growth
and exports. It was also intended to expand and upgrade the network of
financial institutions through which IGLF's credit was provided, and to
promote expertise in project evaluation and preparation.
Project Deacription
3.8      The loan consisted of two parts: (a) the financing of the Industrial
Guarantee and Loan Fund (IGLF) for on-lending through accredited institutions
to SMI for fixed assets and permanent working capital; and (b) the strengthen-
ing of the Department of Industry's Medium and Small Industries Coordinated
Action Program (MAP:CAP) in providing assistance to entrepreneurs in project
preparation. 98% of the loan proceeds were allocated for the IGLF financing.
Covenants
3.9      In addition to the Bank's standard covenants, the Loan Agreement for
1727-PH required the Government (as Borrower) to adopt formally a new IGLF
Policy Statement which included the following major operational policies,
outlined in the Staff Appraisal Report:
(a) inclusion of medium-scale industries in the IGLF program by raising
the maximum loan size rrom the former limit of IF 500,000 to P 2.5
million;
(b)  increasing the effective interest rate to the end-user of IGLF from
13.2Z to 14.7-15Z;
(c) increasing the interest spread allowed to the participating institu-
tiorns from 5Z to 82 on small industry loans and from 5Z to 6Z on
medium industry loans;
(d) adopting a new guarantee scheme; and
(e) introducing a penalty charge on defaults by end-users.



It included an agreement with the Central Bank to furnish the Bank with a
periodic summary of loans made by IGLF along with copies of appraisals of
subloans exceeding R 500,000, and arrears data on IGLF funded loans between
financial institutions and end-users. In adeition, the Central Bank and/or
the Government agreed to the following:
(f) further delegation of authority to the CEO of IGLF regarding the
handling of routine matters;
(g) the reorganization and appropriate staffing of the IGLF unit;
(h)  the calculation of ERR and FRR in appraisal of subloans over 1 1.5
million;
(i)  the preparation of a revised policy manual for IGLF;                               S
(j) an exemption of IGLF financed loans from the requirements set out in
CB/Government circulars and regulations governing money market
operations;
(k) an on-going monitoring of the performance of accredited institutions
by IGLF;
(1) a program to review the IGLF's portfolio of participating financial
institutions;
(m) the adequacy of CB's fee for administering IGLF;
(n) the reorganizatiin of MASICAP;
(o) the submission to the Bank by BOI of quarterly reports on MASICAP;
and
(p) the use of at least 802 of the IGLF loan component for financing
subprojects with: a cost per job created no greater than the Bank's
urban poverty guidelines; or with fixed assets at the time of loan
application not exceeding $250,000.
These covenants were met during the implementation period of the loan.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness and Start-Up
4.1      Conditions for loan effectiveness included approval by the Government
of the draft IGLF policy statement which had been agreed at negotiations,
along with approval of the Loan Agreement by the Monetary Board of the
Philippines. These conditions were met by October 1979, which was later than
expected because evidence that the IGLF Policy Statement had been adopted was
not received by the Bank as quickly as originally anticipated. The loan was
declared effective on November 9, 1979.



4.2      The project started very smoothly.  IGLF's actual performance for
1980 exceeded its operational targets substartially with IGLF approving 170
projects amounting to 1 147.2 million during 1980. By year end 1981, the IGLF
outstanding loan portfolio to the PFIs totalled 1 415.8 million, compared with
the appraisal estimate of 1 361.1 milliot.
Loan Allocation                  &
4.3      Under the loan, $0.5 million was earmarked for technical assistance
to strengthen the Department of Industry's Medium and Small Industries
Coordinated Action Program (MASICAP) in providing assistance to entrepreneurs
in project preparation. The remainder ($24.5 million) was allocated to the
Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund (IGLF) for on-lending through accredited
institutions to SMI for fixed assets and permanent working capital. IGLF used
its full allocation, while MASICAP cancelled about $85,000 of its funds. No
reallocation of the loan by categories was made.
Disbursements
4.4      Annnex 2 shows the estimated and actual quarterly disbursements for
the $24.5 million IGLF portion of the Loan. IGLF's utilization of the loan
was satisfactory, with disbursements ahead of the estimated schedule at
appraisal. The MASICAP component of the loan disbursed more slowly than
expected at appraisal. Delays were caused by (i) a merger of the Small
Business Advisory Centers (SBAC) and MASICAP programs; (ii) a Government-
imposed freeze on hiring by Ministries; (iii) bureaucratic disbursement
procedures between Ministries; and (iv) restrictive Government-issued
procurement guidelines regarding the purchase of vehicles and computers.

4.6      Sectcral Distribution of Subpro4ects.  The IGLF subloans made under
Loan 1727-PH were extended to a wide-variety of subsectors within the
Philippine manufacturing sector. Construction, tourism and service industries
were also subborrowers of the IGLF facility. From 1978 to 1984, the manufac-
turing sector accounted for over 952 of approvals of total subloans by amount,
the more important subsectors being metal products (20Z), food and food
products (18Z); footwear, apparel and garments (112), and plastic products
(see Annex 12). The sectoral distribution was good and in line with the
distribution of SMI assets and value-added within the industrial sector.
4.7      Regional Distribution of Subproiects.  The regional distribution of
subprojects financed under Loan 1727-PH is presented in Annex 4. The share of
subprojects outside Metro Manila totaled 47Z by number and 391 by amount, as
shown below. This did not meet the appraisal target that 602 of IGLF funds be
channeled outside Metro-Manila.

4.8      Subproiect Firm Size.  Medium scale industries received the bulk of
the subloan proceeds, with 84Z cf the funds and 612 of the projects going to
medium scale firms. The details of the funding breakout are shown below. The
distribution of IGLF subloans was in line with the relative shares of value-
added by small and medium scale industry generally, with medium industry
providing 811 of the value-added of those sectors.

Due to the inclusion of medium industr, loans under the prcject, the average
size of IGLF loans grew steadily from P 336,000 in 1978 to P 1.b million in
1984, and averaged $1.0 million for the 1978 to 1984 as a whole.
4.9      ORerational Results of Sample Proiects.  Operational. data on a 292
sample survey of subprojects are provided in Annexes 5 to 7. Cost estimates
made by financing institutions proved to be realistic with an average cost
overrun of about 102. Cost overruns were mainly due to changes in project
design, machinery and equipment, and to extended delays in project
implementation. Large underruns in some projects occurred because the projects
were scaled-down after subproject appraisal had been implemented.
4.10     About 50! of the subprojects surveyed faced delays in implementation
ranging from one to fourteen months. The delays were caused by changes in
supplier and machine specifications, changes in project design, contractors'
delays in project construction, equity deficiencies, difficulties in securing
sufficient financing, changes in project site, delays in the processing of
documents on imported machinery, and late compliance with pro-disbursement



- 10 -
requirements. Annex 8 provides information regarding the subprojects which
suffered implementation delays of six months or longer and cost overruns in
excess of 152 of estimated project cost.
4.11     Estimated and actual sales data -were avalable for the 76 subprojects
surveyed. As shown in Annex 6, actual total sales for 1982 for those projects
amounted to 732 of appraisal estimates. Actual profits were significantly
less than estimated for the sample group as * whole, although profits earned
by 17 projects exceeded estirates for 1982 operations. Significantly, how-
ever, out of the 76 projects, only seven incurred losses of varying deg ees.
To some extent, actual profits were understated because they were based on
surveys done in 1982, which was only the first or second year of initial or
expanded operation of subprojects financed under the loan. Furthermore, in
light of the increase in oil prices, rising inflation and deteriorating busi-
ness climate, the project period was a more difficult time to do business in
the Philippines than had been expected at appraisal.
4.12     Economic Performance of Sample Subproiects.  Annex 6 presents the
details of the economic performance of the subprojects surveyed. Based on
data available for 76 subprojects, it is calculated that 10,497 jobs were
created under the project as a whole (compared to the appraisal estinate of
11,500).  The average cost per job was P 38,000, compared to the estimated
average of P 34,167. The increase in cost per job resulted in the financing
of some capital intensive subprojects such as Baguio Summit Inn (construction
of tourist inn), Aracelli Plastic Products (factory building), Sy's Bros.
Printing Press (machinery/equipment) and Pagsanjan Aggregates (machinery/
equipment). The subprojects surveyed suggest that the total project ccntri-
buted P 373.9 million in incremental sales. While export sales were projected
to represent 29X of total sales, according to the survey data they actually
amounted to only 192 because the projects were operating in a recessionary
period during which export demand was not very strong. The overall
performance of the subprojects was satisfactory, especially given the
difficult economic euvironment in which the project was inplemented.
4.13     Status of Subloans.  As of December 31, 1984, 34 out of 264 loans
under Loan 1727-PH had been either repaid or prepaid in full. Arrearages of
the PFIs to IGLF were 2.1? of all loans outstanding, while arrearages of end-
users to participating institutions amounted to 4.5? of total loans outstand-
ing. Of the 76 subprojects sampled, 20 end-users were affected by arrears
totalling P 2.8 million or 17.2Z of total loans affected by arrears.
4.14     Institutional Sponsorship.  Releases under Loan 1727-PH were coursed
through the following financial institutions:

Nonbank financial intermediaries led the other financial institutions in IGLF
financing both by value and iiumber of projects, accounting for P 181.9 million
or 71.8Z of total credits.  The remaining 1 71.3 million or 28.2? were
sponsored, in descending order, by commercial banks, savings and mortgage
banks and private development banks.
Reporting
4.35     IGLF kept the Bank informed of major developments of its organization
and maaagement, operational and financial targets and achievements adequately
and in a timely manner.
Procurement
4.16     Of the 76 projects surveyed, 57 projects utilized the loan proceeds
for the acquisition of machinery and equipment. The suppliers were chosen on
the basis of several factors: suitability of equipment, availability of spare
parts, efficiency of service, reliability of supplies, compatibility with
present equipment, and price. Goo-ds for 34 subprojects were procured locally
while 23 subprojects directly imported items under proprietary contracts.
V.  OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Overall Operations
5.1      The objectives cf the project were largelv fulfilled.  Loan 1727-PH
was disbursed quickly, with the IGLF component of the loan ($24.5 million of
the total $25.0 million) being fully utilized within two years of loan effec-
tiveness. The loan was used to finance 264 IGLF-funded projects with an
average subloan size of 1 1.0 million. The fast rate of disbursement was due
to the relatively long maturities offered by IGLF, the active participation of
an increased number of accredited financing institutions, the inclusion of
medium scale industry under the IGLF eligibility criteria, the attractive
interest rates charged by IGLF and the increase in spreads allowed to the PFIs
(increased from 7? to 8? for small industry loans and from 5? to 6? for medium



- 12 -
industry loans). Disbursements under the MASICAP component ($0.5 million)
were slower than anticipated because of (i) the merger of the SBA- and MASICAP
programs; (ii) a Government-imposed freeze on hiring by Ministries;
(iii) bureaucratic disbursement orocedures between Ministries; and
(iv) Government-issued procurement guidelines which restricted the purchase of
vehicles and computers. Effective July 8, 1983, $84,465.33 originally
allocated to the MASICAP technical assistance program was cancelled. Under
the MASICAP component, resources were provided to hire permanent staff and
upgrade the facilities of thb regional SBAC/MASICAP offices.
IGLF Operations
5.2      The loan enabled the IGLF program, which already was operating well,
to expand and improve its successful performance. During the implementation
period of Loan 1727-PH, the IGLF expanded to finance medium scale firms.
Loan 1727-PH clearly fulfilled its primary objective of channeling long-term
funds to the SMI sector and the IGLF provided a major portion of total long-
term credit borrowed by the Philippines' small and medium industry sectors.
Loans approved increased by almost 50Z a year, from P 47 million in 1978 to
P 485 million in 1984, with projects financed by those loans generating 10,497
new jobs. By 1984, IGLF had become such an important source of term finance
for SMI firms in the Philippines that it represented 6Z of all long-term loans
outstanding in the country. When compared to the SMI share (21Z) of value
added in manufacturing, it is evident that IGLF represented a substantial
portion of long-term credit extended to SMI in the industrial sector.
5.3      The project realized its goal of expanding and upgrading the network
of financial institutions through which IGLF credit was provided, and specifi-
cally of helping the institutions develop expertise in project evaluation and
preparation. By December 31, 1981, 32 financial institutions were accredited
under IGLF, of which 14 were commercial banks, 12 were nonbank financial
intermediaries (NBFIs), 2 were savings/mortgage banks and 4 were private
development banks (PDBs). At the time of the 1978 appraisal of the project,
there had been 20 accredited institutions, of which 10 were commercial bankr.
9 were nonbark financial intermediaries and 1 was a savings/mortgage bank.
Accordingly, the program increased in size 60? during the disbursement period
in terms of the number of participating financial institutions accredited.
Furthermore, training programs organized by IGLF for PFI staff helped to
upgrade appraisal and supervision activities of the institutions. Although
the percentage of total funds allocated to areas outside Metro-Manila did not
equal the minimum 60Z projected at the time of appraisal, the 39Z of all funds
which did go to firms outside the ce?ital compared well with the share of SMI
value-added contributed by firms outside Metro-Manila (42Z).
5.4      That the goal not only of expanding but also of improving the IGLF
Program was realized during the project implementation period can be seen in
the collection performance between participating financing institutions and
end-users, which improved steadily and substantially during the implementa-
tion period of the loan (see Annex 16). In 1978, collections amounted to only
about 17Z of principal and interest falling due and past due, improving to 372
in 1980, to 50Z in 1981 and 1982, and to 54Z in 1984. The proportion of PFI
portfolio affected by arrears from end-users decreased substantially from 422



1 13 -
by amcint and 512 by number in 1978 to 121 by amount and 221 by number in
1984. At year end 1984, arrears amounted to only 4.5! of all IGLF loans out-
standing, and were even lower (3.5) for institutions participating in the
program under the accreditation scheme. A comparative statement of arrears
position and an analysis of loans in arrears between participating institu-
tions and end-users of IGLF from 1978 to 1984 are shown in Annex 18. In addi-
tion, collection performance between participating institutions ar.d IGLF
improved substantially. Loan arrears to IGLF in 1978 represented 16! of the
loan portfolio while in 1984, arrears accounted for only 2.1! of the 1984 loan
portfolio. Several changes in IGLF policies brought about these improvements.
First, a major change had occurred in 1976 when, under the first Bank loan for
IGLF, the accreditation scheme was introduced. Previously, all subprojects
had been apprais i and supervised by IGLF, which had neither the experience
nor the branch network reqaired for proper review and control. Under the
accreditation scheme, IGLF adopted a rigorous appraisal system to approve
specific financial institutions for participation in the program; the PFIs
were then given re3ponsibility for project approval and supervision. In
addition, the arrears ratio improved under the loan because average subloan
size increased substantially with the new eligibility of medium-scale
inCustry, and the larger industries showed a better repayment rate.
5.5      Information collected on a sample of IGLF projects financed under-
Loan 1727-PH shows significant contributions made to sales, profits, exports,
import substitution and employment. This is consistent with the positive
economic impact of IGLF throughout its history. The total number of incremen-
tal jobs generated by IGLF projects financed under Loan 1727-PH is estimated
at about 10,497. The IGLF projects funded under the Loan were expected at the
time of appraisal to generate P 5,675 million in sales, of which about 11Z
would come from exports. Although actual figures obtained for a sample of
projects financed under Loan 1727-PH indicate that these estimates were opti-
mistic, the net impact was still quite Gubstantial.  In addition, the fac
that the overwhelming majority of firms financed by the loan were profita. e
and operational as of end-1984 shows the success of the program. A sample of
subprojects reviewed revealed that only about 10! of operations funded we-e
incurring losses at the time of evaluation in 1982.
5.6      Regional Development Under Loan 1727-PH.  The one explicit project
objective that was not fulfilled under the loan was channeling of a majority
of project funds outside Metro-Manila. The proportion of project funds lent
to the regions was significantly lower than expected (39Z vs 60Z), with Metro-
Manila absorbing a greater than anticipated share of the total IGLF credit.
The failure to achieve the required regions-to-capital ratio is attributable
in part to lack of interest of the participating financing institutions, which
considered solicitation, approval and supervision of projects in remote areas
as impractical owing to the high cost of maintaining these accounts. But more
importantly, it was a result of the fact that most firms prefer to be located
near Manila, since it is the country's maior port and largest consumer market,
with easy access to communication and transportation. Indeed, the proportion
of subloans that went to the regions was similar to the share in 1983 of value
added in the SMI industrial sector originating in the regions (42z).
Additionally, it may be that the failure of IGLF to support more projects in
rural areas relates to IGLF's focus away from cottage industry. The
experience of Loan 1727-PH suggests that rather than compelling the banks or



- 14 -
providing subsidies or even undertaking direct IGLF lending to stimulate
lending in the regions, the issue of regional dispersion probably should be
addressed through specially-designed micro-enterprise projects since a major
part of the problem is the IGLF's inability to reach cottage firms, the vast
majority of which are located in the regions.
5.7      The experience of Loan 1727-PH suggests that several lessons may be
learned from the implementation of the project, particularly with regard to
ibsues of (i) interest rates and foreign exchange risk; (ii) proper diversifi-
cation of the apex lending institutions portfolio to the financial institu-
tions; and (iii) the appropriate vehicles for lending to cottage industries.
Aspects of the project relating to these three element, are discussed in
paras. 5.8 to 5.13 below.
5.8      Interest Rates and Foreign-Exchange Risk.  The loan shows the
difficulties of lending through financial institutions in an economy with a
regulated interest rate structure such as that of the Philippines at the time
of the loan. The overall interest rate structure was set artificially low and
even within that long-term rates were set particularly low. In order to
ensure disbursement, the IGLF rates were set consistent with this structure.
However, this meant that (i) the rate to the final beneficiary was
significantly less than market conditions would have determined (on-lending
rates were about 152 while inflation was in the range of 13-18z); and (ii) in
order to give the PFIs adequate spreads to engage in long-term lending, they
were advanced the IGLF money at a rate much less than they could borrow
domestically (IGLF lent to the PFIs at 8.6? while 90 day deposit rates were
11.0?).
5.9      Since the regulated rate structure generally failed to reflect the
economy's perception of foreign exchange risk and domestic inflation, the
long-term rates charged by IGLF to the PFIs notably incorporated little or no
premium to cover foreign Pxchange risk. The 8.6? average rate charged for
IGLF funds at the outset of SMI II was 0.7? higher than the 7.9Z interest rate
charged by the Bank on Loan 1727-PH. While this spread enabled the Bank-
financed projects to cover a portion of IGLF's total administrative costs
(which amounted to 0.9Z of average total assets), it was not enough to allow
it to compensate the Government for taking the foreign exchange risk on the
World Bank loan. Since the peso was devalued substantially against the
currencies in which the loan was disbursed, the Government incurred
significant foreign exchange losses on the Bank loan. The average rate of
exchant for disbursement against the dollar was P 7.73, while the mid-1988
rate is about P 21.
5.10     By 1982, when interest rates in the Philippines had begun to be dere-
gilated and ceilings on savings deposit rates had been removed, the IGLF
prices were re-examined and adjusted upwards so that the PFIs paid 11? for
small industry loans and 16? for medium industry. These increased interest
costs were closer to the still-administered cost of time deposits. However
the $24.5 million portion of Loan 1727-PH allocated to IGLF had been fully
disbursed by that time.
5.11     The experience of Loan 1727-PH suggests that in such environments,
apex lending should be linked to financial sector reform in which interest



- 15 _
rates are liberalized. Once rates are market-determined, interest rates from
apex institutions to PFIs and to end-users can include a premium for foreign
exchange risk. A oroposed fourth SMI World Bank loan which would provide
further funding to IGLF will be made in the context of financial sector
reforms and will include a provision that subloans be priced at market rates
and hence provide reasonable cover to the Government for the foreign exchange
and interest rate risks.
5.12     Diversification of IGLF Portfolio.  Of the 32 accredited institutions
as of December 31, 1981, 11 were particular.y active and accounted for 942 (by
amount) of IGLF loans outstanding. Two institutions accounted for 54Z of the
portfolio as of year end 1981. Over 30Z of the portfolio was held by a single
institution, Manphil Investment Corporation, which later went bankrupt.
Another 231 was held by the Private Development Corporation of the
Philippines, which also experienced financial problems in the mid-1980's. The
failure during the loan implementation period to highlight the excessive domi-
nance of these two firms put IGLF in a potentially dangerous situation.
Fortunately, Manphil's IGLF portfolio was reduced substantially before the
default, but IGLF was left with sizeable arrears from that institution. Since
the Manphil default, IGLF has imposed a limit on loans to any single institu-
tion at 100Z of that institution's total capital, net of reserves. Such a
restriction provides reasonable protectionL to IGLF in the case of default by
individual PFIs.
5.13     Experience with Cottage Industry.  IGLF's experience during the
implementation of Loan 1727-PH suggests that the p;ogram is not an effective
vehicle for extending credit to cottage or micro-enterprises. No cottage
industry projects were financed under the lrn. For those subloans to cottage
industry which were in repayment during 1980 and 1981, 88Z were affected by
arrears of more than three months (compared to 14Z for small and medium indus-
try loans during the same two-year period). The high costs of administering
cottage industry loans makes them inappropriate for such a program. Since
lending to cottage industries is incompatible with conventional banking
operating practices, they cannot be administered by a majority of financial
institutions in a cost-effective manner. The project illustrates that the
apex arrangements which are appropriate for lending to small and medium firms
may be inappropriate for effectively reaching cottage firms.
VI. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF IGLF
6.1      Financial Position. IGLF's projected and actual balance sheets for
1978 through 1984, presented in Annex 15, reflect the high growth in IGLF's
loan portfolio under Loan 1727-PH. Total assets grew at an average rate of
37Z annually (see Annex 13), which growth was almost entirely financed by
drawdowns on the two IBRD loans and Government counterpart funds. As of
December 31, 1984, total assets stood at P 1,088 million.  The loan portfolio
had grown by about eight times over the period 1978 to 1984 and, as of the end
of 1984, amounted to P 1,037 million.
6.2      Capital Structure and Liquidity.  IGLF's net worth increased by more
than three times between 1978 and 1984, growing from P 75.4 million in 1978 to
P 333.7 million in 1984. The increase was due to the accumulation of



- 16 -
counterpart funds from the Philippine Government plus retained earnings during
the seven year period. IGLF's total debt Lo c-;1ity ratio fluctuated from
1.2:1 to 2.5:1 over the period. IGLF's liquidity position was erratic, moving
from a high of 12.3 in 1978 to a low of 0.3 in 1982 and 1984. The tight
liquidity position was largely due to additional funding requirements for term
loans and to the increase in principal and interest payments on IGLF's long-
term loans.
6.3      Profitability.  IGLF's income statements for the period 1978-84 (see
Annexes 14 and 15-A) show that IGLF's total operating income increased at an
average of 442 per annum over the seven years under review and stood at P 89.5
million in 1984. The sources of income were interest on loans, interest on
temporary investments and guarantee fees. Interest income from term loans as
a proportion of total income increased from an average of 73Z for 1978-83 and
87Z for 1984. IGLF's return on assets fluctuated during the project years
from 1.82 in 1978 to 3.1Z in 1984. Its return on equity improved from 3.71 in
1978 to 8.52 in 1980; it declined in 1981 and 1983 and later improved again to
10.4Z in 1984. Financial expenses as a percentage of gross income steadily
increased from 512 in 1978 to 69Z in 1981 and decreased to 57Z in 1984. The
decrease was partly due to the marked increase in interest income from term
loans with only a slight increase in interest expenses on IBRD loans.
6.4      Because the Government absorbs the full foreign exchange risk on the
World Bank loans, the financial losses resulting from deterioration of the
peso do not affect IGLF. If IGLF were required to cover its foreign exchange
losses, the financial picture during the 1978 to 1984 period would have been
significantly less healthy.
6.5      Guarantee Scheme.  One of the IGLF features embodieu under Loan
1727-PH is the optional guarantee coverage wherein the IGLF shareg in the
losses with a financing institution in case of ultimate failure by the
borrower to pay. Two kinds of guarantee coverage were offered. Under the
credit risk guarantee (up to 602 of the loan for small industry and 402 of the
loan for medium industry), the 22 guarantee fee is absorbed by the financing
institution while under the collateral-short guarantee (maximum 25Z of the
loan), the 22 guarantee fee is passed on to the borrower. A reserve account
of P 1.0 million was set up in 1975, in accordance with the Master Agreement,
to take care of losses on guaranteed loans. As of year-end 1984, the balance
of the Provision for Losses on Guaranteed Loans amounted to P 11.6 million,
which was intended to cover the estimated total losses of P 7.4 million, based
on claims submitted by the various sponsoring financing institutions. Based
on guarantee fees collected during the period, the amount of P 4.7 million was
set up for possible losses in 1984. Losses on 18 foreclosed loans totalling
P 3.7 million were written-off in 1984.
6.6      Audit.  IGLF is audited yearly by the Commission on Audit and the
Central Bank is provided with a copy of the audit report including any
comments and findings of the auditor. The Office of the Auditor issued its
report for 1984 without qualifications.

VII. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
Institutional Aspects
7.1      Manaaement.  Policy issues affecting IGLF's operations during the
implementation period of the loan were decided by a Review Committee composed
of the deputy ministers from NEDA, DTI, the Department of Finance, a deputy
governor of CB, the director of the UP-ISSI and the director of the Department
of Loans and Credit at the Central Bank, as ex-officio member, and chaired by
the Minister of the Budget (see Annex 21). The Technical Advisory Groip
(TAG), composed of all agencies forming the IGLF Review Committee, exercised
recommendatory and advisory powers dealing with policy and operational
matters. The TA' was under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer for
IGLF.
7.2      Organization.  IGLF was reorganized during the project period.  In
1979, there were only two divisions involved in IGLF operations--the Indus-
trial Loans Division and the IGLF Accounting, Securities Control and Collec-
tion Division--and the total personnel complement of the organization was 48
people. With the approval of 18 new positions for IGLF by the Monetary Board
of the Central Bank, the IGLF organizational structure was reorganized. The
organization was changed to its present :tructure of four divisions (see Annex
e) witsi cht Lr,-L,,I-iZg res;-~n.ibilities:
Industrial Proiects Division - responsible for the desk processing/
evaluation of applications for IGLF financing under the accredita-
tion/sponsorship schemes, the servicing of guarantees, requests for
deferment/restructuring, and portfolio review of accounts in arrears.
IGLF Examination Division - primarily responsible for evaluating
potential institutions for accreditation and for the annual institu-
tional performance review of accredited institutions, as well as end-
use verification surveys of projects assisted.
IGLF Accounting, Securities Control and Collection Division - handles
all the accounting, securities control and collection functions of
IkLF
IGLF Special Studies Staff - handles research and technical informa-
tion activities, and the reporting requirements to the World Bank,
NEDA, CB and the Review Committee.
7.3      Training.  Because of the clear importance within both IGLF and the
PFIs of analyzing credit risk and assessing projects and institutions, IGLF
initiated a number of programs under Loan 1727-PH to further develop the
experience of its staff and that of the PFIs. In addition, during the project
years, the staff of IGLF and the PFIs attended relevant local training
programs, and 13 IGLF staff were sent abroad to acquire additional knowledge
on small enterprise financing and related fields. They attended such training
programs as Small Industry Promotion in Developing Economies, and Small
Industry Financing Courses in India; Advanced Training on Financial Management
in the Netherlands, and training at the Federal Business Development Bank in
Vancouver and Montreal, Canada. Programs attended arE listed in Annex 20.

Procedures and Standards
7.4      Proiect ADDraisal.  Because of the importance of the project
appraisal to the success of the program, IGLF developed and refined specific
standards and procedures for appraisal under Loan 1727-PH. Under the accredi-
tation scheue, project appraisal is the responsibility of the accredited
financing institutions, which undertake the necessary detailed research and
evaluation of the project, assess the appropriateness of the proposed financ-
ing package based on the real needs of the borrower, and determine the overall
feasibility of the project. The appraisal follows preliminary analysis of the
relevant industries, as well as of the marketing, technica:, management and
financial aspects of the projects. Plant visits provide first-hand views of
the operations. Project feasibility studies or project evaluation reports are
prepared for the approval of the PFIs executive committees and are submitted
usually with only minor changes to IGLF.
7.5      An analysis of reports prepared under the project suggested some
deficiencies which IGLF has sought to correct through training programs
initiated under both this project and the follow-on SMI III project. A review
of Loaii 1727-PH financed subprojects showed that evaluation procedures of the
PFIs were deficient in their lack of attention to marketing and technical
aspects, and in their over-estimation of financial benefits. For example, a
mere list of competitors often was the sole marketing document. There was no
attempt to identify existing and possible potential customers. No study was
made to establish existence of sufficient demand in the locality. Regarding
technical aspects, little consideration was given to the necessity for the
buildings proposed for renovation or expansion, or to the benefits of the
expansion project to the borrower in terms of production and space. The PFIs
were generally optimistic in their financial forecasts, and actual subproject
performance under Loan 1727-PH was lower than estimated (see Annexes 6 and 7).
Some accredited institutions tended to rely more on the value of collateral
than on project analysis.
7.6      To strengthen the quality of project evaluation, training programs
were implemented during the project time period to assist financial institu-
tion staff to screen loan applications and to identify possible strengths and
weaknesses of projects and potential problems. The programs helped PFI
personnel to analyze project technical and marketing data in greater depth,
and to adjust financial forecasts from optimistic scenarios, and to undertake
sensitivity analysis.
7.7      Proiect Supervision.  Most of the accredited financing institutions,
although primarily responsible for project supervision, were found under the
SMI II Project not to have any established, definitive system of supervision
and account monitoring in their IGLF lending. Post-audit surveys of IGLF
projects were not conducted by the PFIs on a regular basis. The repayment
performance of IGLF borrowers was used as a gauge as to whether or not there
was a need for visual inspection. Results of plant visits, if any, were
summarized in post-audit inspection reports which contained limited informa-
tion on the utilization of the loans and on the operating performance and
financial status of the borrowers. The value of collateral was not reassessed
during the project period. No records were maintained to systematically
monitor the status and performance of each IGLF borrower. Credit file folders



- 19 -
maintained by participating financial institutions were poorly kept and data
therein were not updated. The submission of periodic financial statements by
each IGLF subborrower was not strictly imposed but was enforced only during
the IGLF examiners' end-use verification of selected projects. While the
deficiencies could be partly explained by the limited number of personnel
directly assigned to supervise these projects, IGLF has since the completion
of the project stressed the importance of adequate supervision by the PFIs and
has included guidelines for appropriate supervision in its training programs.
7.8      Although at the outset of Loan 1727-.?H there was no regular review
conducted on the performance of participating financing institutions, ad hoc
monitoring of PFIs was performed and the PFI's were required to correct or
remedy deficiencies or shortcomings as they emerged. With the establishment
of the IGLF Examination Division under the loan, however, institutional
appraisal of financing institutions began to be conducted regularly. Reports
on findings and deficiencies were transmitted to the institutions concerned
and were accompanied with recommendations. Financing institutions were
required to submit reports to IGLF on any action to correct or remedy these
findings, and on any recommended measures implemented.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
Proiect Justification and Overall Performance
8.1      The project achieved its basic objective which was to expand IGLF's
lending to the SMI sector in the Philippines. Long-term resources not other-
wise being provided within the banking system were made available for long-
term financing needs of both small and medium scale industries. Furthermore,
substantial progress was made in improving repayment performance, which has
reached a level to effectively sustain the IGLF program. IGLF played a
catalytic role in providing employment opportunities, improving income distri-
bution and regional development, and stimulating exports and general economic
growth. Under the project, IGLF'S network of financial institutions was
expanded significantly, and expertise in project evaluation and preparation
was gained. Bank involvement helped IGLF to develop its institutional frame-
work, organization, and operating policies and procedures.
Supervision
8.2      The Bank's supervision effort on thG project was generally adequate,
although more frequent supervision, specifically a mission in 1981, may have
revealed earlier that the IGLF interest rate was out of line with the general
economic environment and may have resulted in an earlier change of the IGLF
price charged to PFIs and end-users.
Working Relationship
8.3      The Bank maintained good working relationships with the Government
and IGLF. IGLF made all relevant information readily available to Bank staff
and the response to inquiries was always prompt and adequate.

IX. SUMHARY AND CONCLUSIONS
9.1      The Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund continued under Loan 1727-PH
to act as a key instrument in the Philippine Government's program to promote
and develop small and medium-scale industries on a nationwide scale. During
the implementation period of Loan 1727-PH, the IGLF expanded to include
finance for medium scale firms, and the IGLF provided a major portion of total
long-term credit borrowed by the Philippine.' small and medium industry
sectors. Loans approved increased by almost 502 a year, from P 47 million in
1978 (the date of project appraisal) to P 485 million in 1984, with projects
financed by those loans generating about 10,497 new jobs. Total disbursement
of the loan proceeds was realized ahead of the projected schedule. Most of
the 264 subprojects financed under the loan proved to be economically and
financially viable in addition to being labor-intensive.
9.2      IGLF's network of accredited institutions' branches throughout all
regions of the country was expanded significantly during the time period of
the loan. Although the percentage of total funds allocated to areas outside
Metro-Manila did not equal. the minimum 60? projected at the time of appraisal,
the 39? of all funds which did go to firms outside the capital compared well
with the share of SMI value-added contributed by firms outside Metro-Manila
(42Z). As intended, the sectoral distribution of IGLF's loan portfolio was
dominated by loans to the manufacturing sector although some service and
tourism oriented industries also were beneficiaries.
9.3      During the implementation period of loan, the IGLF program
substantially improved its arrears and collection ratios, which by 1984 were
at satifactory levels. The proportion of the PFIs' portfolio to end-users
affected by arrears was only 12Z by amount and 22? by number in 1984, and
arrears themselves amounted to only 4.5? of all IGLF loans outstanding (or of
3.5? of IGLF loans made under the accreditation scheme). Loan arrears from
the PFIs to IGLF amounted to only 2.12 of the IGLF's loan portfolio in 1984.
9.4      IGLF's financial position was acceptable.  Return on assets fluctu-
ated during the years from 1.82 in 1978 to 3.1X in 1984. Return on equity
improved from 3.7Z in 1978 to 8.5? in 1980; it declined in 1981 and 1983 and
later improved again to 10.4? in 1984. Financial expenses as a percentage of
gross income steadily increased from 51? in 1978 to 692 in 1981 and decreased
to 57? in 1984. The decrease was partly due to the marked increase in
interest income from term loans with only a slight increase in interest
expenses on IBRD loans. The continuous growth in total assets during the
1978-84 period was financed almost entirely through IBRD loans and Government
counterpart funds. Since IGLF relied heavily on foreign borrowings and since
the Philippine Government took the foreign exchange risk on the loans, the
Government incurred substantial losses from foreign exchange adjustments.  The
peso-dollar exchange rate (see Annex 22) declined from P 7.4 in 1978 to 1 11.0
in June 1983, to P 14.0 in October 1983, to 1 18.4 in December 1984, and
P 21.0 in June 1988. The proceeds of Loan 1727-PH were disbursed at the
average rate of P 7.7 to US$1.00.
9.5      IGLF staff was reorganized and strengthened during the project
period. IGLF expanded from two to four divisions, and staff numbers were
increased accordingly. IGLF offered technical assistance and training to both



- 21 -
financing institutions and end-users, to enhance staff expertise in project
appraisal, project evaluation, and project supervision and monitoring. Public
relations efforts to help expand the usage of IGLF were implemented and were
influential in promoting the program.
9.3      Several lessons which may be learned from the Lank's and IGLP's
experiences under Loan 1727-PH are outlined below:
(a) In pricing subloans made by apex institutions in interest rate
regulated economies, it may be difficult to ensare that end-usfrs pay
an appropriate foreign exchange risk premium. The experience of Loan
1727-PH suggests that in such environments, apex lending should be
linked to financial sector reform in which interest rates generally
are deregulated. Once rates are market-determined, then interest
rates from apex institutions to PFIs and to end-users can include a
premium for foreign exchange risk. A currently proposed Bank loan
which would provide further funding to IGLF will be made in the
context of financial sector reforms and will price subloans at
market-linked rates.
(b) During the implementation period of Loan 1727-PH, IGLF did not limit
the participation of individual financial institutions in order to
ensure that the IGLF portfolio as a whole was balanced or diversi-
fied. The weakened financial situation of some of the PFIs during
1980 to 1984 period suggests that this failure to diversify was
unwise. In 1981, after the bankruptcy of one PFI holding a large
portion of the IGLF portfolio, IGLF adopted a policy limiting the
participation of individual PFIs and specifying that a PFI's port-
folio of IGLF rediscounted loans may not exceed that institution's
total net worth.
(c) The experience of IGLF under Loan 1727-PH suggests that the apex
arrangements which are appropriate for lending to small and medium
firms may be inappropriate for effectively reaching cottage firms.
IGLF's record with cottage industry during the project period showed
poor repayment and suggested that making and supervising cottage
ine'istry loans was overly cumbersome and expensive for IGLF. The
da;a suggest that another vehicle for financing cottage industry
should be created and that IGLF should not be pushed to fil] the
financing gap to that sector.

COST OVERRUNS IN EXCESS OF 152 OF ESTIMATED PROJECT COST
1.   Canaan Ham and Sausage (Estimated-P500,OOO; Actual-P815,OOO)
Overrun represented the costs incurred in fencing and construction of
workers' quarters and restaurant which were not originally included in the
estimated project cost.
2.   Modern Equipment and Chemical Enterprises (Estimated-Pl,900,000;
Actual-P2,500,000)
Cost overrun was caused by long delays in project implementation due
to high construction costs which were not anticipated before the grant of
the loan.
3.   Philippine Aluminum Fabricators (Estimated-Pl,298,000; Actual-P2-158,000)
An overrun in the actual cost of the building resulted because of the
deviation from the original plan of a two-storey to a three-storey
building, not discounting the increasing cost of building materials.
4.   Treasure Island Industrial Corporation (Estimated-P3,060,000;
Actual-F3,560,000)
Cosc overrun represented the additional cost incurred in the
construction of the factory building which was originally estimated at P2.2
millien but was finished at P2.7 million.
