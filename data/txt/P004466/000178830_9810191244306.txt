THE SECOND SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Recent Developments
1.01      Industrialization has been a prime objective of Philippine economic
development since independence. The industrial sector /1 grew rapidly in the
fifties as the Government's import substitution policy, an overvalued exchange
rate and low interest rates led to a significant replacement of imports by
domestic production. This was followed by a period of slower growth through
the 1960s. The economy picked up temporarily in 1972 and 1973 but this
improvement was short-lived, and growth rates fell sharply as a consequence
of the 1974 recession; the growth rate of gross value added at constant
prices in the manufacturing sector dropped from 13.9% in 1973 to 3.5% in 1975
rising again to 5.7% in 1976 and 7.5% in 1977.
1.02      The industrial sector contributed 34.7% of GDP in 1977 (see Table
below) of which 71% was from manufacturing. The manufacturing sector also
accounted for about 30% of fixed investment and 10.4% of total employment.

/1 The industrial sector includes mining, manufacturing, constructution
and utilities.



- 2 -
The mining sector was stagnant over the period 1973-77, and comprised only
1.6% of GDP in 1977 mainly because of the low world market price of copper.
Owing to an increase in the production of nickel and copper and a higher
price of chromite, the mining sector experienced a growth rate of 20% in 1977
(constant 1972 prices). The construction sector grew rapidly between 1974-76
mainly because of the growth of relatively construction-intensive public
investment, but the growth leveled off in 1977 and 1978.

Although manufacturing value added grew by an average annual rate of 6.8%
over the period 1970-1976 the relative sectoral share did not change signi-
ficantly. During the first half of the period intermediate goods slightly
increaser! their share of total value added at the expense of consumer goods,
but this trend was reversed and in 19'77 consumer goods accounted for 51.2% of
total gross value added.  The rmajor growth industries were chemicals and
rubber products (16.3%), beverages and tobacco (9.2%), and transport equipment
(9.3%),
1.04      Export Performance,  Manufactured exports grew slowly until the
late 1960s. The 1970 devaluation followed by the floating of the peso,
together with the introduction of import duty rebates and the system of
bonded warehouses for exporters, contributed to an increase in the growth of
manufactured exports in the early 1970s. The most dynamic aspect of this
export growth has been the rapid surge in exports of nontraditional manufac-
tures, especially garments, handicrafts and electronic products, which have
risen from US$226 million in 1973 to $545 raillion in 1976 and $717 million in
1977, an annual average growth of 33% during 1973-77./1  The export value of
minerals, particularly copper, increased significantly in the late 1960s and
early 1970s but slumnped in 1975. Increased production of copper and a higher
price for chromite raised the value of mineral exports from $362 million in
1975 to US$520 million in 1977.
1.05      Ownership Size and Value Added.  The industrial sector is predom-
inantly privately owned and generally concentrated in large capital-intensive
units. In 1975 organized manufacturing units with over 200 employees repre-
sented only 2.9% of the total number of registered enterprises but accounted
for over 66% of total manufacturing employment and 72% of valued added.
1.06      Employment Performance.  Until the mid-1970s the industrialization
process did relatively little in terms of employment creation. Between 1960
and 1971, employment in manufacturing grew at an annual rate of about 2.5%,
fell to zero percent between 1971 and 1973 but rose again to 8% for the
period 1974-1976. In 1977, some 1.6 million workers were employed in the
manufacturing sector. This included an estimated 1 million employed in the
unorganized sector in small household and craft operations. In 1977, 50% of
the employed labor force was in agriculture, 18.5% in services, 12.6% in
commerce and 10.4% in manufacturing. Industry is expected to provide a much
larger proportion of jobs in the future, particularly through increased
exports and the development of cottage and small-scale industry./2

and 86 in 1976.  Registrations increased again to 142 in 1977,  Simultaneously,
the number of newly registered btusiness organizations fell. from 49,367 in
1974 to 31,136 in 1975 and 30,813 in 1976.  Between March and May 1976,
investrnent expectations rose as the business community perceived signs of
recovery in the US and Japanese economies (based on economic data released
in the first quarter).  However, it later became cldmaf thain che world wi-de
recovery would be slower than expected.  Consequ.ent-ly, growth of expenditure
on durable equipment in the manufacturing sector fell to 5% il3 1976 and is
not expected to have grown significantly ill 1977 and i978,          i The most notable
feature of investment for the period 1975-77 has hne,r thcl; rapid growth in
construction which had grown at an annual avverage rate of 10%' for the period
1971-74 but rose by 52% in 19175, and by anothe,-r 30% in 192/6 before falling
to 6% in 1977.  The growth sectors irn 1977 were mining and quarrying,
and utilities which grew at 20% and 17% respectively.
Industrial Sector Issues and Policies
1.08       Development Objectives.  In its five ye3ar plan, the Phi lippiae
Government has set as objectives for industrial groc)wth  emiqployment generation,
increased net foreign exchange earnings and greater seJ.f-relianee in commodity
supply.  The generation of employment opportunities is probably the highest
priority./2  The estimated growth in the labor force over the nexc decade is
3% p.a., and this means that the economy will have to employ annually almost
500,000 new entrants into the labor force over this period.  Because the
agricultural sector is likely to provide fewer nlew jobs annually than in the
past, the provision of more work opportunities in the mainufactur-iLng secto:
is crucial.  This employment growth can be fostered through developing
further exports of labor-intensive nontraditiooal- manufac tures, reviving and
sustaining growth in the labor-intensive modern small and rtedi um-industri es
sector, and expanding the domestic productioni of intermediate goods througl-
import susbtittution.  At the same time as employmient generation is pucsued,

Development, June 1976.

there is also a need for investment in a few large capital intensive projects
to deepen the industrial structure and to develop further the country's
natural resources.
1.09      Industrial Incentives.  Since 1967 industry has been assisted
through a wide range of fiscal incentives, mainly for investment. /1 The
industrial incentives system has been strongly biased in favor of the use of
capital. For instance, in 1976, 83% of the total estimated amount of tax
relief enjoyed by BOI-approved projects arose from capital-favoring incentives.
Policies that have encouraged the use of capital rather than labor include
exemption from import duties on imported capital equipment, accelerated
depreciation allowances on capital investment, and exemption from income tax
of funds used in project expansion. Attempts to counterbalance this bias by
introducing incentives for the use of labor in the modern sector have had some
limited success. The Government has introduced some policy changes and is
currently reviewing the entire incentive system to make it more conducive to
employment, export and the needs of efficient import substitution.
1.10      Export Promotion.  Exporters have been assisted mainly through
rebates of tariffs on imported inputs. Exporters may also gain free access to
imported inputs by locating in the Bataan Export Processing Zone or by obtaining
a licence to operate a bonded warehouse. The Government has recently under-
taken further actions to assist exporters: a Philippine Export Council, com-
prising both public and private representatives has been established to study
and make recommendations on various aspects of export promotion; various
credit agencies have been asked to give priority to the financing of exports
particularly nontraditional exports. Such financing is crucial if the full
export potential of the Philippines is to be reached. But a more important
and effective policy in the long term would be for the Government to change
the existing system of tariffs and quantitative restrictions on imports from
its strong bias in favor of import substitution to a freer trade regime. This
would mean a gradual removal of quantitative restrictions and a leveling of
tariffs. A less restrictive trade regime would especially help the smaller
and less organized firms which have not been able to benefit from the facili-
ties of bonded warehouses and tax and tariff concessions on account of either
limitation of size or lack of information.
1.11      Import Substitution and Tariff Reform.  The present tariff structure
combined with quantitative restrictions on imports provides relatively high
protection for import substituting consumer goods industries and little or no
assistance to producer good and export industries. As a consequence, invest-
ment for the production of intermediate goods, particularly in the engineering
sector, has suffered. Furthermore, over-protected import substitution
industries often produce low quality output which cannot compete in inter-
national markets. A tariff reform in 1973 resulted in administrative improve-
ments as well as in substantial reduction in the number of tariff categories
/1 There are 24 incentives to enterprises and 12 incentives to investors
listed under the Investment Incentives and Export Incentives Acts.

and a narrowing of the spread of tariff rates. However, the general alloca-
tive effects of the tariff structure remained largely unchanged. Recent
studies of the Philippine tax system by international agencies recommend the
changes in the tariff system, including reducing high tariff levels and easing
quantitative restrictions on imports. The Government, recognizing the
importance of consistency between the tariff structure and other investment
incentive programs for Philippine industrial development, is reviewing the
tariff system to ensure that it conforms to current development goals and to
provide effective machinery for continued evaluation and flexibility in the
future. Several important steps have already been taken by the Government,
including reducing the number of goods subject to the highest tariff levels
and limiting the granting of tariff exemptions. NEDA has commissioned a
comprehensive study, financed by the Bank, to quantify the effects of tariffs,
quantitative restrictions, and other tax incentives, and to recommend appro-
priate policy changes. This study has been a crucial input into the Bank's
Industrial Sector Mission that was in the field in February 1979.
1.12      Regional Dispersion of Industry.  Manufacturing enterprises are
heavily concentrated in Metro-Manila and adjoining provinces. In 1975,
Metro-Manila accounted for 52% of all manufacturing establishments employing
more than 10 people, 51% of total industrial employment; 59% of gross value
added, and 38% of total fixed assets. If adjoining provinces are also in-
cluded, these percentages would rise by a further 20-30%. The Government is
aware of these problems and has taken several steps to create conditions for
a more geographically balanced growth of industry. Some of these measures
included BOI's practice of negotiating a project location prior to approval;
a ban on the establishment of new nonexport-oriented plants within 50 kilome-
ters of Metro-Manila; requirements that financial institutions use at least
75% of deposits generated from a province for projects in that province; and
a directive to the Developlent Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and the Industrial
Guarantee and Loan Fund (IGLF) that 60% of their SMI financing should be in
regions outside Metro-Manila. Despite these measures, however, industry
still remains heavily concentrated in the Metro-Manila area. The Government
recently announced the suspension of the 50 kilometer ban for certain classes
of industries, and this may lead to a slowdown in the rate at which industry
is moving out of Metro-Manila.
1.13      An absolute condition for investments to be directed into desired
locations is the provision of adequate supporting infrastructue and the
availability of qualified labor. Fiscal incentives without such infrastruc-
ture are unlikely to induce many new investments in the outer provinces and,
with such infrastructure, may not be needed to a large extent. The Government
has launched several programs designed to improve the basic infrastructure in
areas outside Metro-Manila: electricity generation projects, road construction,
and a 10-year shipping and shipbuilding program are being planned for Mindanao
and the Visayas. These efforts should be extended to other less developed
regions as well. To promote areas of industrial concentration away from Metro-
Manila, the Government, in recent years, has emphasized the establishment of
industrial estates and export processing zones. Eight estates are planned by
the Government to be operating or to have feasibility studies carried out by
1982. In addition, Government's policy permits privately operated estates.



1.14      The Bank is currently acting as Executing Agency for a UNDP-financed
regional study. Heavy emphasis has been placed on regional planning and
project implementation with initial concentration on Region VII - the region
with the best potential for growth outside Manila. It is expected that this
study will lead to projects in Region VII and eventually other regions that
will encourage the decentralization of industry and employment.
Prospects
1.15      The lackluster performance of the Philippine manufacturing sector
over the past few years has in part been due to slow growth of domestic
demand, overprotectionist economic policies of the Government and slow
recovery of the Philippines' major trading partners. However, prospects for
growth are good, especially if the Government follows its announced policy of
lowering tariffs and easing import restrictions.
1.16      Over the medium-term the Government will be encouraging labor inten-
sive export industries. Some capital-intensive projects will also have to be
undertaken to bring about greater vertical integration and increase the
domestic value added in processing the country's raw materials. According to
the "Five-Year Philippine Development Plan 1978-1982," manufacturing is
expected to grow at an annual rate of 9% over this period. To achieve this
target, investment over the five year period will have to grow by 15.5% p.a.
or a total P 86 billion; approximately 65% of this investment will go to
larger industries. The key to industrial growth lies in manufactured exports;
in particular, nontraditional exports are projected by NEDA to grow by 26.8%
p.a. over the next ten years in contrast to a growth rate of 18.8% for total
exports for the same period. Industries with significant export potential
include textiles, apparel, leather goods, handicrafts, electronics, chemicals,
and goods manufactured from nickel, copper and aluminum.



2. THE SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRIES (SMI) SECTOR
The Role of SMI in the Manufacturing Sector
2.01      Cottage Industries.  According to the latest Annual Survey of Manu-
facturers (ASM) /1 about 73% of 10,742 manufacturing establishments surveyed
in 1974 were cottage industries (5-19 workers) /2 and were engaged in food
processing, clothing, footwear, furniture, and handicrafts. They employed
about 13% of the manufacturing labor force but contributed only 2.5% to gross
value added. However, as the ASM data do not cover establishments with fewer
than five workers, the shares of cottage industries in manufacturing employ-
ment and value added are likely to be considerably understated by the above
figures. The National Cottage Industries Development Authority (NACIDA) esti-
mated that there were some 71,000 cottage industry units in the Philippines
in 1975. It was further estimated that they provided direct employment for
over 230,000 workers and indirect employment for another 890,000. Based on
these figures, the share of cottage industries in manufacturing employment
would rise to about 75% and in manufacturing value added to about 8%, or
close to the unofficial estimate of 75% and 10%, respectively, made in
1973./3
2.02      Size of the SMI Sector.  Establishments with more than 20 workers,
which comprise the modern manufacturing sector, accounted for 19% of the
units covered by the 1975 Census of Establishments (COE). In 1975, small-
scale firms accounted for 73% of the total number of firms in the modern
manufacturing sector, 18% of total employment, and 10% of value added.
Small and medium industries together accounted for 85% of the total number of
/1 ASM is a nationwide sample survey undertaken by the National Census
and and Statistical Office (NCSO) in every year except 1967, 1972, and
1975, when the Census of Establishments (COE) was undertaken. The final
report on 1975 COE is not yet ready.
/2 The NCSO has classified the size of industrial establishments according
to the number of employees. For purposes of this report, establishments
employing 20-99 workers are classified as small industry; those employing
100-199 workers, medium industry; and those employming more than 200
workers, large industry. This classification has been found to correspond
fairly well with the "official" classification based on fixed assets,
whereby enterprises with assets of P 100,000 to P 1.0 million are
termed small industries; those with assets of over P 1.0 million to
P 4.0 million medium industries; and those with assets over P 4.0
million large industries.

firms in the modern manufacturing sector, 29% of the labor force, and con-
tributed 30% to gross value added. The growth rate of SMI has been uneven.
After a modest increase in the mid-1960s, growth in SMI, measured by employ-
ment and value added declined during 1967-71. Although official statistics
for the latest years are not available it is believed that after 1971, SMI
experienced a rapid real growth particularly after 1974 when Philippine
Government's SMI development program came into effect.
2.03      Regional Distribution of SMI.  Manufacturing activity has always
concentrated around the Metro-Manila area and the adjoining provinces of
Central and Southern Luzon. SMI tended to concentrate in or near urban
areas, where they were close to sources of raw materials, spare parts, and
markets. In 1975, an estimated 76% of SMI establishments were located
in these three regions as compared with 74% in 1971; Metro-Manila alone
accounted for 63% of all SMI. These three regions were responsible for 78%
of employment and 56% of value added generated by all SMI; Metro-Manila's
contributions were 65% and 51%, respectively. Large-scale industries seemed
to be less geographically concentrated than SMI; cottage industries also
tended to be more widely dispersed. The Table below gives the contribution
of Metro Manila and Central and Southern Luzon to modern manufacturing.

2.04      Role of SMI by Major Industry Groups.  While the modern manufactur-
ing sector in terms of employment and value added concentrated on the pro-
duction of consumer goods, the impact of SMI was greatest in the production
of intermediate goods. In 1975, SMI accounted for 38% of the employment
generated in the production of intermediate goods and 27% of value added;
comparable figures for the consumer goods industry were 22% and 35% respect-
ively. Industries in which SMI contributed more than 50% to employment were:
furniture, printing and publishing, and leather products.

Institutional Framework for Assistance to SMI
2.05       A Commission on Small and Medium Industries (CSMI) was created in
1974 in the Ministry of Industry (MOI) to provide a coordinated, integrated,
and comprehensive multi-agency approach to the development of SMI. Twelve
agencies /1 are currently represented on the CSMI. However, the member agencies
continue to operate under their own budgets, which are often subject to other
/1 There have been two major reorganizations of the CSMI since its creation.
Some of the 12 member agencies have changed from one reorganization to
the next.

constraints, and this has prevented the CSMI from playing a more active role
in program formulation and implementation.  Since late 1977, the CSMI has
been unsuccessfully attempting to get a budget allocation for a number of
multi-agency programs related to SMI assistance. Despite its constraints,
CSMI since m1-d-1977 has played a very active role in the promotion and devel-
opment of Philippine SMI. The CSMI has emphasized the importance of estab-
lishing links with large industries to encourage subcontracting, transfers of
technology, and management skills. The CSMI proposes to establish 10,000 new
SMI enterprises engaged in manufacturing and industrial services over the
next five years (1978-1983). These establishments are expected to generate
250,000 jobs. To attain this objective, the CSMI is developing about 30
programs in seven functional aspects of SMI development: enterprise project
development, entrepreneurial development, innovative financing assistance
programs, consultancy services, technical assistance projects, regional
promotion programs, and growth enterprise development.
2.06      Technical Assistance for SMI.  As part of the overall program of
assistance for SMI, various Government agencies have programs to train entre-
preneurs to assist in project development and to provide consultancy ser-
vices. UPISSI has an entrepreneurship development program which focuses
primarily on entrepreneurs in the rural areas. UPISSI is also working with
the Ministry of Education (MOE) to introduce entrepreneurial training
into the general school curricula, emphasizing in particular, achievement
motivation.
2.07      The Medium and Small Industries Coordinated Action Program (MASICAP)
of the MOI assists small entrepreneurs in project feasibility studies and in
applying to financial institutions for loans./1  MASICAP currently has 49
field teams (with some 147 staff) operating throughout the Philippines.
Since its establishment in November 1973 and until September 30, 1978,
MASICAP has assisted 5,300 projects of which 4,090 were submitted to financial
institutions. To provide operational assistance to SMI, MOI established in
1975, with the Bank's assistance,/2 Small Business Advisory Centers (SBAC).
One SBAC in each of the 12 administrative regions has been set up to provide
managerial and technical consultancy services to small business enterprises.
As of June 1978, the SBAC had a staff of 84. As of the same date, the SBAC
had provided extension services to 772 establishments, of which over 86% were
manufacturing units. In addition, the Ministry of Trade (MOT) has organized
the establishment of Trade Assistance Centers (TAC) to work in coordination
with the SBAC in providing marketing assistance to small business enterprise.
As of June 1978, there were 13 TAC established, with a staff of 251, of which
51 were marketing coordinators in the Central Office in Manila while the
other 200 were based in 12 regional offices. The TAC have assisted 3,659
establishments to date. The Design Center of the Philippines (DCP) and the
Food Terminal Inc. (FTI) also provide marketing-related assistance to SMI for
product design and development, storage and distribution.

2.08      In conjunction with the CSMI, the Economic and Social Commission
of Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) is attempting to identify growth centers in
non-metropolitan areas and specific industries which have significant forward
and backward linkages. Feed mills and cassava have been identified as growth
industries for three pilot areas. ESCAP will provide the funds while CSMI
will be in charge of project management. Assistance in marketing will be
provided by TAC, in finance by MASICAP and in technical matters by the
Ministry of Agriculture. ESCAP will also finance consultants to identify new
projects based on cassava and other agro-based industries.
2.09      A CSMI Technology Services Delivery System has been prepared
by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) to transfer
relevant technology to end-users in rural areas; the SBAC will be used to
effect the transfer. This project will involve the CSMI and four agencies of
the National Science Development Board that deal with metals, forestry,
science and technology, and food and nutrition. A pilot project is to be
conducted in Iloilo.
2.10      Other Programs of Assistance for SMI.  These include a collective
marketing scheme by the MOT to enable SMI to take advantage of economies of
scale in marketing and distribution, a subcontracting promotion program by
MOI, and an industrial estate development program by NEDA. In line with its
increased business orientation, the CSMI has also initiated two programs to
encourage more private sector involvement in SMI development. One program is
aimed at encouraging successful Manila-based business groups to invest equity
and technical resources in rural areas and for experts in management and
industry to assist SMI as sponsor-advisers.
2.11      Financial Assistance to SMI.  The two major sources of medium-
and long-term credit for SMI in the Philippines are DBP and IGLF, of which DBP
is the more important. The volume of term credit provided by both DBP and
IGLF increased substantially in 1975 when the Bank's first loan to assist SMI
(Loan No. 1120-PH) became available. DBP is now using its third industrial
loan (Loan No. 1572-PH), with an SMI component of $29.7 million. Between July
1975 and September 1978, total approvals for SMI loans by DBP amounted to
P 466.4 million for 1,119 projects. During the same period, IGLF approved
384 projects for P 97.8 million./l Private development banks (PDB) have also
provided term funds (mostly medium-term) for SMI. However, resource shortages
have led them to concentrate on lending to cottage industries, highly collater-
alized projects, and shorter term loans. Although loans made by PDB have
grown by an average annual rate of 25% in 1973-77, this financing covered only
a small fraction of total SMI demand for term credit. Other financial institu-
tions, such as the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines (PDCP)
and the Philippine Investments Systems Organization (PISO), which operate
small business programs, have now been accredited by IGLF. By and large,
except for DBP, most credit sources for SMI concentrate on the financing of
cottage and small industries while credit availability for medium industries
is relatively restricted.
/1 Details given in paras. 4.19 to 4.28.



- 13 -
2.12      Short-term financing for SMI remains relatively undeveloped.  At
the end of 1974, the Central Bank (CB) introduced a preferential credit
scheme under which commercial banks and thrift institutions could rediscount
up to 80% of short-term loans to SMI with CB at a preferential rate of
interest (5%) for onlending to SMI at 12%. However, the use of this facility
has been limited because the commercial banks require first mortgages on
real estate collateral. Most SMI borrowers have already mortgaged their
collateral to term lending institutions. The commercial banks, moreover,
prefer to deal with larger clients. As the availability of short-term credit
for working capital is particularly important for SMI enterprises, CB is
undertaking a study to devise ways to induce the commercial banking sector to
lend for SMI. Meanwhile, both DBP and IGLF have increased the volume of
working capital finance to SMI and have liberalized the terms and conditions
for such financing.
2.13      Research on the SMI Sector.  The CSMI is trying to obtain budget
funds to conduct a national study on Philippine SMI. Phase I, which is based
on existing sources of data, has already been completed. Phase II, which
will be the substantive part of the study, will be based on a nationwide
survey. This has been delayed due to insufficient resources. In the meantime,
the International Development Center of Japan (IDCP) has undertaken a two-phase
study of the SMI sector /1, utilizing most of the data and conclusions of the
CSMI study (Phase I). The purpose of this study was to provide the background
information necessary for technical cooperation between the Philippines and
Japan on SMI. UPISSI has, in collaboration with the International Development
Research Center of Canada (CIDRC), completed a two-volume study on the
history and development of SMI in the Phiippines./2
2.14      The Bank has also conducted its own studies on SMI in the Philip-
pines. In May/June 1978 a consultant studied certain specific industries
in which SMI predominate. The report identified problems and suggested
/1 The first phase of the study was a very detailed analysis of the industrial
and geographical distribution, factor proportions and efficiencies, as
well as problems and prospects of SMI, especially in comparison with
large-scale industry. The second phase, which had already started when
the appraisal mission was in the field in November, was to focus on some
specific subsectors of SMI.
/2 The report, entitled International Research Project on Small Industry
Development: A Comparative Study, was completed October 31, 1977. The
first volume, "Assistance Programs for Small Industries Development in
the Philippines" described the institutional framework for SMI assistance;
the second volume, entitled, "Organization for Small Industries Develop-
ment in the Philippines: Case Histories," described the activities of the
various financial and technical assistance organizations dealing with
SMI. As with all institutional write-ups, most of the details, especially
in respect of the CSMI, are already outdated. Nevertheless, the two
volumes are useful as a compendium of past historical happenings and
programs in respect of the SMI sector.



- 14 -
solutions for firms in the food processing, garment manufacturing, metal
products and machinery, and furniture and fixture industries. The Develop-
ment Policy Staff (DPS) of the Bank has also been doing a study of small-
scale enterprises (SSE) in the Philippines in collaboration with the CSMI,
which concentrates on factors affecting enterprise formation and growth, and
evaluates the credit and technical assistance programs designed to support
SSE.
Prospects for SMI
2.15      The NCSO data on SMI permit only a partial analysis of the SMI
sector up to 1975. As the Government's assistance programs for SMI started
only in 1974, it is perhaps too early for their impact to become manifest in
the 1975 data. Nevertheless, from the increased volume of lending for SMI by
DBP, and to some extent IGLF, during 1975-78, the assistance programs have
started to have some impact. The TAC, while improving domestic acceptance
of SMI products, will also be likely to stimulate exports, particularly with
their programs to encourage nontraditional exports. The industrial estate
programs should help eliminate some of the infrastructural and support
services constraints that affect SMI. Economic distortions resulting from
the Government's industrial incentives and protection policies have been
studied by the recent Bank industrial sector mission, providing a basis for a
dialogue with the Government on remedial measures. In conclusion, given the
Government's assistance programs and the improved policy and institutional
arrangements, the future prospects of SMI appear to be good.

3. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
Overview
3.01      In terms of the institutional set-up the Philippines has a rela-
tively well developed financial system. The core of the system is the large
commercial banking sector comprising both local and foreign banks. Long-term
finance is provided by three development finance institutions although
several other types of institutions also provide this kind of financing to a
limited extent. In late 1976 Offshore Banking Units (OBU) were established
and the Government relaxed some of of its regulations regarding Foreign
Currency Deposit Units (FCDU). Although two stock exchanges exist, the
volume traded is small and is concentrated in a few issues. The Land Bank of
the Philippines (LBP) was revitalized by the Government in 1973 to help
implement the agrarian reform program. The Government has played a major
role in the development of the rural banks and private development banks.
Profile of Financial Institutions
3.02      Commercial Banks.  As of December 31, 1977, the commercial banking
sector comprised 26 privately owned domestic banks, 2 government-owned banks
and 4 foreign banks. The government-owned Philippine National Bank (PNB) is
the largest commercial bank and accounted for over 27% of the banking system's
total assets in 1977. The commercial banks provide industry with working
capital and trade credits; loans and investments made by commercial banks
during 1977 amounted to P 55 billion.
3.03      Development Finance Institutions.  The government-ownied DBP, the
privately owned PDCP and, to a lesser extent, PISO are the major providers of
long term finance. As of December 1977, the total assets of DBP, PDCP and
PISO were P 15.6 billion, P 910 million and P 126 million, respectively.
3.04      DBP's funds come from equity contributions by the Government,
borrowings from CB, foreign exchange borrowings guaranteed by the Government,
deposits primarily from the Government, internal cash generation and the sale
of DBP bonds. In the past, DBP securities have carried low rates of interest,
but special features such as tax exemption and eligibility for reserve require-
ments have enabled them to compete with other securities. DBP supplies credit
and extends guarantees to both agriculture and industry which is broadly
defined to include manufacturing, transportation, tourism, public utilities,
and professional services. In addition, DBP is in charge of establishing and
developing private development banks.
3.05      Although PDCP is defined as an investment bank its main business
is the provision of long-term loans which accounted for 82% of its total
assets as of December 31, 1977; equity investments occupy a relatively minor
(4.5%) position. As of the same date, the major source of PDCP's resources
were IBRD/IFC and ADB loans (68.5%), other long-term liabilities (20.5%) and



- 16 -
equity contributions (6.6%). PDCP lends primarily for manufacturing and
transportation. Whila some resources go to agriculture the volume lent is
marginal.
3.06      PISO, incorporated in 1974, is privately owned and operates as
an investment banking institution. Until recently PISO operated primarily
in the money market but over the last year, as a result of an IBRD loan,
has increasingly gone in for term lending. As of December 31, 1977, its
money market operations and long-term loans accounted for 74% and 4.2%
respectively of its total assets. As of the same date, the sources of PISO's
resources were short-term notes (64%), other short-term liabilities (11%),
long-term debt (3%) and equity (22%). PISO lends primarily to manufacturing
and service industries and for transportation equipment.
3.07      Private Development Banks (PDB).  The 35 PDB have been promoted
by DBP/CB in various regions to mobilize local savings and to allocate
resources to both agriculture and industry. To date, each PDB has had
half of its initial capital contributed by organizers from the private
sector and half by the Government through DBP or the LBP. As of December 31,
1977, the total resources of PDB amounted to P 595 million with a deposit
base of P 341 million. Loans approved by PDB as of December 31, 1977
amounted to P 202.5 million. In terms of sectoral distribution, 40.6% went
for industry, 35.2% for agriculture and 24.2% for miscellaneous activities
such as low-cost housing, vocational schools and commercial loans. In terms
of maturity, medium-term loans constituted about half the amount, the other
half being equally divided between short- and long-term. In general, the PDB
tend to be larger and more sophisticated than the rural banks.
3.08      Rural Banks.  Rural banks are unit banks which are municipality
specific and provide short-term loans primarily to agriculture. The rural
banking system comprises around 850 privately-owned banks. At the end of
1977 their total assets and deposits amounted to P 3.3 billion and P 1 bil-
lion respectively. Of the loans made in 1977 by rural banks, 87% were
for agriculture most of which were for seasonal production credits. The
Government has actively encouraged the growth of rural banks by providing
counterpart equity contributions, loans and technical assistance, tax exemp-
tions and special rediscounting schemes.
3.09      Investment Houses.  As of 1977 there were 12 licensed investment
houses each with a minimum paid-in capital of P 20 million. Most of the
investment houses are linked to major international financial institutions
and large local commercial banks. Until recently, about 80% of their
revenues accrued from money market operations with only a small proportion
coming from security trading or the provision of merchant banking services.
Owing to the impact of recent regulations on the money market, investment
houses are trying to provide more merchant banking services.
3.10      Finance Companies.  The Securities and Exchange Commission has
244 finance companies registered with it. Of these, the 42 largest account
for 80% of the turnover. At the end of 1977, the finance companies had



- 17-
total resources of P 880 million while loans outstanding amounted to P 4.0
billion. Most of the finance companies are subsidiaries of major commercial
banks and are engaged in financing the purchase of consumer durables, and
providing short- and medium-term credit to local manufacturers and traders
to finance inventory, receivables and transport equipment. Until 1978
finance companies were not covered by CB interest rate ceilings and, consequently,
could charge up to 24% a year on discounting of receivables. Under a recent
Presidential Decree, financing companies are to be directly regulated by CB
with respect to the interest rate charged on assignment of credit, purchase of
installment papers and accounts receivable.
Financial Markets
3.11      The Money Market.  The money market comprises basically three
submarkets: (a) government securities; (b) inter-bank; and (c) inter-company.
The government securities market is the principal segment, with the govern-
ment being the largest trader. The main securities traded are short-term
Treasury Bills, medium-term Central Bank Certificates of Indebtedness (CBCI)
and Treasury Notes, and DBP bonds. While direct trading in Treasury Bills is
heavy, trading in longer term securities is mainly indirect, i.e., the secur-
ities themselves are not traded, but serve as collateral for repurchase
agreements. Participation in the inter-company market is restricted to firms
with prime credit ratings.
3.12      Until January 1976, money market rates were not subject to the
statutory ceilings imposed on bank deposits. Hence there was a rapid growth
in deposit substitutes at the expense of traditional bank deposits. In an
attempt to mobilize savings through the banking institutions and to increase
the term of these savings, CB introduced a series of new regulations. Some of
the more important regulations include: raising the interest rate on saving
and time deposits and regulating the yield on money market operations; increas-
ing the minimum denomination and maturity period of money market operations;
and raising the required reserves against deposit substitutes. Finally, in
June 1977, a transaction tax of 35% on interest paid on all commercial paper
issued in the primary market was imposed./l The money market appears to be
particularly affected by the transaction tax which is borne entirely by the
borrower. As a result of the legislation imposed, the value of deposit
substitutes traded fell by 11.5% during the period March 1977 to March 1978.
Over the same period, the volume of savings and time deposits rose by 17.9%
and 47.4%, respectively.
3.13      The Bond Market.  The private long-term debt market has been practi-
cally nonexistent in the Philippines; over the period mid-1967 to mid-1975, no
private debt securities were issued. Some of the factors discouraging the
development of the market were thought to be: the high rates of return obtained
from operating in the short-term market; domination of the term market by
government securities placed through coercive marketing techniques or offering
privileged terms; and the low interest rate charged by government institutions
on their long-term peso resources. Recently, the above scenario has changed.
/1   At the same time, a tax was imposed on interest earnings of savings
and time deposits but was levied at 15%.



- 18 -
First, the new CB regulations have considerably reduced the return from
money market operations: the short-term money market rate fell to a weighted
average of 9.8% in June 1978 from an average of 14% in 1977 and significantly
more in 1976. Second, the Government has decided to place its securities
without resorting to privileged terms. A recent CBCI issue was neither
eligible for reserve requirements nor tax exempt. Third, the interest rate
charged by DBP on the long-term peso loans was raised from 12% in 1975 to
14-16% in 1977.
3.14      Partly as a consequence of these changes a bond market began
to develop in 1977. Several issues have recently appeared on the market:
a convertible subordinated debenture issue for P 50 million, a preferred
share issue for P 40 million; a premium bond issue for P 20 million; and a
mortgage bond issue for P 125 million. Most of the issues have been under-
written while a few have been private placements. Sale of these issues was
no problem during the first and second quarter of 1978 as the market was then
highly liquid. However, as the market has become progressively less liquid
during the latter part of the year, the interest rate has risen and it has
been increasingly difficult to sell the bonds. Some underwriters have
attempted to establish a secondary market for issues they have underwritten
announcing that they would buy and sell issues at prices to be posted daily.
They are hoping to expand the base of the secondary market by getting other
investment houses and traders to participate. If a secondary market operates
successfully, a major constraint in the development of the bond market will
have been removed.
3.15      The Securities Market.  Over the period January-September 1978 the
volume and value of stock traded on the Manila and Makati stock exchanges
increased by 12.3% and 88.0% when compared to the same period in 1977. For
the first quarter the pace in stock trading was set by the commercial-indus-
trial issues. Oil and mining stock then took over as a result of anticipated
commercial oil production and the increase in copper prices. There was
little foreign investment in local shares; according to the CB, for the
period January to August 1978, foreign investment in local stock was minimal.
3.16      Despite the increase in local activity on the stock market, relatively
little capital expansion is being financed through the stock exchange. A
supply constraint appears to exist in the case of equity issues as private
owners are unwilling to share control over their enterprises. In 1977, a 5%
development tax was levied on closely held corporations to encourage dilution
of ownership. However, to date, the tax has not been sufficient incentive for
firms to go public and other measures may have to be considered to strengthen
the stock markets. While the development tax penalizes closely held corpora-
tions, little has been done to give positive incentives to firms to go public.
Recent Developments
3.17      Interest Rate.  Until 1976 the yield on money market instruments
was unregulated while statutory ceilings were imposed on bank deposits.
Legislation was enacted in 1976 to channel funds from the money market into



- 19 -
bank deposits. The legislation was aimed at both the banking sector and
non-bank financial intermediaries. In the case of the banking sector maximum
deposit rates were increased and, for the first time, a distinction was made
between short- and long-term lending rates. The major changes enacted were:
ceilings on loans with maturities of more than 2 years were raised to 19%;
secured and unsecured loans of less than 2 years continued to have a ceiling
of 12% and 14% respectively, although a service charge of 2-3% could be
added; the maximum yield on money market instruments with maturities of up to
2 years, including all charges, was set at 17%; all ceilings on yields of
instruments with maturities of over 2 years were removed.
3.18      In December 1977 further interest rate legislation was introduced.
The major change was a reduction of the effective maximum yield, inclusive of
the 35% transaction tax and bank charges, from 17% to 16% on deposit substi-
tutes with a maturity of two years or less with a further reduction in the
yield to 15% effective July 1, 1978.
3.19      In June 1978 financing companies were placed directly under the
regulation of CB with respect to the interest rates that could be charged
on transactions involving assignment of credit on the purchase of installment
papers and accounts receivable. While in the past financing companies could
charge up to 24% on discounting of receivables, they are now limited to a
maximum of 14% while a discount rate of up to 2% a month can be charged on
the factoring of accounts.
3.20      According to a recent CB study, the new interest rate regime has,
in part, been responsible for narrower interest rate fluctuations.
3.21      The Recent Growth of Offshore Banking Units (OBU) and Foreign
Currency Deposit Units (FCDU). A significant development in the Philippine
banking system was the establishment of offshore banking facilities in
September 1976. The purpose was to develop Metro-Manila as a regional
financial center. As of August 1978, aggregate resources of the Philippine
offshore banking system stood at US$1,338 million. Of this total 57% were
offshore funds, 41% onshore deposits while the rest comprised other liabili-
ties. Inter-bank deposit liabilities (offshore and onshore) are the major
source of funds and account for 99.8% of OBU resources. On the asset side,
inter-bank placements amounted to US$1,060 million or 79.2% of OBU funds.
Approximately 60% of OBU funds went to the domestic market. Of these funds
67.8% went to the domestic inter-bank market while the remaining 32.2% went to
resident borrowers./l In terms of maturity, a significant proportion of the
loans had a maturity of under a year although, in all probability, a large
number of these are rolled over. OBU appear to be competing quite effectively
with both commercial banks and investment houses. Their success lies in both
their aggressive lending activities and large resource base which assures
regular funding.
/1 Of the loans made to nonbank resident borrowers 45% went to the manufac-
turing sector, 29% to public utilities and 15% to mining; the remaining
11% going to agriculture, commerce, construction and financial institutions.



- 20 -
3.22      An FCDU is an accounting unit or department in a local bank or
in the local branch of a foreign bank authorized to operate under the expanded
foreign currency deposit system. As such, FDCU operate as the domestic
counterpart of OBU. As of January 1978, 17 commercial banks have been
authorized to establish FCDU. As of December 1977, FCDU had operations
to the tune of $1 billion. The resources of FDCU came primarily from inter-
bank deposits and from the foreign currency deposit system. Total 1.oans
from FDCU amounted to $200 million of which 40% were to domestic institutions.
3.23      While performing similar functions, some differences exist between
OBU and FCDU. First, FCDU may enter into foreign currency swap transactions
with CB which OBU are not permitted to do. Second, until recently, FCDU
were subject to a 100% identical foreign currency cover requirement on their
loans. This requirement has now been relaxed to 70%; the remaining 30% to be
held in eligible currencies. This relaxation should enable FDCU to be more
active in foreign currency trading.
Financial Sector Issues
3.24      Capital Allocation.  The current interest rate differential between
the administered short- and long-term interest rates, especially as the
short-term rate approaches its ceiling, is such that private development
financial intermediaries find it difficult to raise medium- and long-term
local currency resources for onlending./l However, as the demand for medium-
and long-term peso resources exceeds the supply, whatever local currency funds
are available go to prime companies. On the other hand, medium- and long-term
foreign exchange resources have been available through DBP, PDCP and, recently,
offshore banking units. Hence the paradox that in an economy short of foreign
exchange, foreign exchange resources are available while the local currency
resources are more difficult to procure. However, foreign exchange is only
available to procure imported goods and costs much more than local currency
financing once the foreign exchange risk is taken into account.
3.25      The Arrears Problem of Government Financial Institutions and Credit
Programs. Government financial institutions account for 42% of the assets
of the banking system while the government sponsored, but privately owned,
rural banking system accounts for another 3%. The Government, through specific
programs administered through different types of financial institutions, has
attempted to meet the credit needs of the economy which were not being ade-
quately met by the private sector. Most of these programs have faced low loan
recovery rates, threatening the financial viability of the institutions
involved. This arrears problem is widespread. At the end of June 1978, 52% of
DBP's loan portfolio was affected by arrears. The comparable figure for rural
banks was over 90%.
/1 This does not hold for DBP which has access to low cost local currency
funds.



- 21 -
3.26      Mortgage Banking.  While some form of home mortgage lending is
provided by most existing private financial institutions, there is an absence
of specialized private sector housing intermediaries. Savings and mortgage
banks which were to perform this function are unable to do so owing to their
limited capacity to mobilize savings. This has resulted in relatively small
annual home mortgage flows and little liberalization of mortgage lending
terms. The establishment of a mortgage bank which would mobilize resources
for mortgage loans through the issuance of long-term mortgage bonds has long
been advocated and has recently been implemented. However, the effective
yield of mortgage bonds would have to be at least 15%-18%o/1 if they were to
compete with other financial securities. Assuming a spread of approximately
3%, the onlending rate would have to be 18%-21%. This might prove difficult
given the current 19% ceiling on debt instruments with a maturity of over
two years./2
3.27      Conclusion.  There has been a rapid change in the financial environ-
ment because of recent legislation: the CB Circulars of January 1976; the tax
package of July 1977; the interest rate restructuring of December 1977;
restructuring of CB borrowing and lending operations in June 1978. In order
to focus on some of the issues raised above and to identify other areas of
concern in the changing Philippine financial environment, a financial sector
mission recently visited the Philippines. It is hoped that this mission will
result in an ongoing dialogue with the Philippine Government on these
and other related issues.
/1 The effective rate on a recent mortgage bond issue was 22% p.a.
/2   While there is a ceiling on the maximum lending rate no such ceiling
exists on the rate that can be offered for deposits with a maturity
of over two years.

4. INDUSTRIAL GUARANTEE AND LOAN FUND
A. Institutional Aspects
Charter and Objectives
4.01      The Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund (IGLF) is not an institution
but a long term compensatory financing and guarantee fund.  IGLF was estab-
lished in 1952 under a Counterpart Project Agreement (CPA 32) between the
Philippine Council for United States Aid /1 and the Economic Co-operation
Administration (ECA) of the US./2  The objectives and principles enunciated
in CPA 32, though amended on several occasions, still provide the framework
for IGLF's operations. IGLF's basic objective is to provide resources to a
variety of financial institutions for onlending to small- and medium-scale
industry./3 At present, the participating institutions charge the end-user
an interest rate of 12% on IGLF loans but pay IGLF an interest rate of 7% on
the 100% compensatory financing provided, leaving the institution with a
gross spread of 5%. In addition, a guarantee fee of 2% /4 is charged to the
end-user by the financial institutions. Criteria governing project selection
are enunciated in CPA 32, and conform with national development priorities
such as employment generation, export promotion and geographical dispersion
of industry.
Ownership and Administrative Arrangements
4.02      The IGLF is owned by the Government of the Philippines.  While the
fund is under the overall jurisdiction of NEDA, it is administered by CB
on the basis of a Master Agreement, first enacted in 1952 and last revised in
1975.  At present, CB handles all the operations of IGLF under the supervision
of an inter-agency Review Committee (RC) which advises IGLF on all policy
issues. However, the final authority to approve basic policy changes still
rests with the Director General of NEDA.
4.03      Since the Bank first became associated with IGLF in 1975, a number
of changes have occurred in the composition and role of the RC. Initially
the RC comprised four regular members, one each from NEDA, CB, UPISSI and MOI.
Until 1977, RC was essentially a working level committee which met frequently
/1  Predecessor to the National Economic Council which later became the
National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA).
/2  Predecessor to USAID.
/3  Even though its charter allows it to finance medium scale industry, IGLF
until recently financed small industry only (assets of up to P 1.0
million).
/4  Under the terms of IBRD Loan Agreement No. 1120-PH IGLF's financing
using Bank funds carries a 60% automatic guarantee.

to consider loan approvals. As a result, RC was often bogged down in day-to-day
operations and was unable to provide IGLF with necessary policy guidance& In
addition, since representation by member agencies/ministries on RC was at the
working level, the committee was unable to: (a) influence Government policies
with respecL to IGLF; (b) promote the necessary inter-agency cooporation for
successful implementation of joint SMI programs; and (c) encourage financial
institutions to participate in the IGLF programs. Hence, it became necessary
to strengthen RC. The introduction of the accreditation scheme in late 1976
resulted in a sharp reduction in the number of projects that had to be vetted
by RC (para. 4.12) making it no longer necessary for the committee to meet
frequently. In late 1977, RC was both restructured and upgraded. As shown
in Annex 1, the four original member agencies are now represented on the RC
at the deputy minister level. In addition, the Director of CB's Department of
Loans and Credit (DLC) which administers IGLF, was appointed Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) of 1GLF and designated as an ex-officio member of RC. In 1978,
the membership was further broadened to include a representative from the
Ministry of Finance (MOF). The present RC is a high-powered body which has
the necessary connections to influence the formulation and implementation of
polices and programs affecting SMI. Given the importance and standing of the
members of RC, it is not possible for them to meet frequently. This, however,
is not necessary as, under the accreditation scheme, investment decisions are
made by the accredited institutions and merely reported on an ex-post basis.
Moreover, RC is presently formulating guidelines which would delegate author-
ity to CEO for most of the routine matters. Once these are implemented, the
RC will be able to concentrate on policy issues and other matters of
significance.
4.04      In 1976, RC passed a resolution formally creating the IGLF Technical
Committee. This Committee comprises a representative from each of the member
agencies. The role of the committee is to brief RC about current operations
and carry out any special assignments given it by RC.
Organization and Staffing
4.05      Organization.  The IGLF program is administered by CB's Department
of Loans and Credit (DLC). This department is also responsible for all
domestic sector lending done by CB. Within DLC a separate unit handles
IGLF operations. An organization chart of the IGLF unit is given in Annex 4,
C-1. While the DLC Director oversees IGLF operations, the unit is managed by
an assistant director and comprises, for the most part, loan evaluators/exami-
ners and data analysts. The current organizational structure does not
reflect present needs as it was set up prior to the implementaton of the
accreditation scheme whereby project appraisal and supervision responsibil-
ities rest with the accredited institutions. The current organizational
structure makes it difficult to assign responsibilities between different
members in the unit. In addition, as there is no second level management,
the assistant director has to oversee all IGLF operations. During negotia-
tions an understanding was reached with the Government that the IGLF unit
would be strengthened by adopting a reorganization plan responsive to the
operating demands of the IGLF program. Broadly, the new organizational
structure (Annex 4,C-2) would comprise five divisions of which two would deal
with the accreditation and sponsorship schemes respectively:



- 24 -
(a) the Rural Bank Division would deal with all aspects of the
sponsorship scheme (para. 4.07); and
(b) the Evaluation and Follow-Up Division would be responsible for
all the operations undertaken by accredited institutions such as
project approvals, fund disbursements, follow-up, restructuring,
recall, etc.
The three other divisions would be:
(c) the Promotional Division would identify, approach and evaluate
institutions which might qualify for accreditation, while assisting
and training already accredited institutions. This division would
also monitor the performance of accredited institutions (para. 4.16).
(d) the Research and Information Division would conduct studies on
the impact of IGLF financing, consider the future needs and direc-
tion of the program and would be responsible for meeting all
reporting requirements; and
(e) the Accounting Division would do all the bookkeeping and accounting
for the IGLF unit.
The actual implementation of the broad reorganization scheme outlined above
would be gradual and would depend upon availability of suitable staff.
4.06      Staff.  The number of staff in the IGLF unit has shown a secular
increase. The total professional staff rose from 18 (September 1975) to
21 (March 1976) and currently stands at 23./i If the IGLF unit is to function
efficiently not only will all the 36 positions currently allocated to the unit
have to be filled, but an additional allocation of 10-15 positions will be
needed. All of IGLF's professional staff are college graduates and many have
postgraduate degrees. While the professional caliber of some of the staff is
reasonably satisfactory, most would benefit from further training, particularly
in the field of industrial project appraisal and follow-up. UPISSI and other
institutions in the country offer training programs suitable for IGLF staff.
During negotiations CB's policies and practices for recruiting and maintaining
adequate and qualified staff for the IGLF unit were reviewed and found generally
satisfactory.
Procedures and Standards
4.07      Appraisal.  IGLF's appraisal procedures have been simplified and
shortened since the introduction of the accreditation scheme. Prior to the
accreditation system, the participating financial institutions, after process-
ing the loan application at their end, submitted a project study along
with other requisite papers to NEDA for a cursory examination. NEDA then
/1 Six additional professional staff are on loan to the IGLF unit from
other units in the DLC.



- 25 -
forwarded the application to the TGLF unit where it was subjected to another
evaluation procedure including a project visit. The appraisal report pre-
pared by IGLF staff was then presented to RC for approval. This long
procedure discouraged a number of small entrepreneurs and financing institu-
tions from using IGLF financing. Under the accreditation scheme which came
into effect in 1976, the accredited financial institution itself appraises
and approves the project. The project, on being approved, is sent to IGLF
which merely undertakes a desk study to see if the project conforms to its
lending guidelines./l If it does, the loan is disbursed immediately./2 The
time taken by IGLF to disburse under the accreditation scheme varies between
three to seven working days compared to a minimum of four to six months under
the old sponsorship scheme. The new procedures appear to be operating satis-
factorily as far as IBRD funded projects are concerned. However, rural banks
still operate under the sponsorship scheme. The quality of appraisals varies
according to the institution. The more active accredited institutions under-
take fairly comprehensive appraisals which adequately cover all relevant
issues. However, appraisals done by other accredited institutions, partic-
ularly commercial banks, are mostly collateral oriented and provide little
analysis of the project. Such institutions would receive assistance from
IGLF. Owing to the small loans under IGLF, no financial (FRR) or economic
rate of return (ERR) was calculated. During negotiations, the Government
confirmed that henceforth IGLF would require the accredited institutions to
calculate the ERR and FRR for all subloans in excess of P 1.5 million.
4.08      Supervision.  Projects approved by accredited institutions undergo
a two-tiered supervision process. First, IGLF staff conduct their own end-
use verifications before disbursement of the second installment of the loan
and within six months of full disbursement. This supervision is chiefly
to guard against diversion of funds by verifying the existence of assets
financed under the project. Owing to staff constraints, IGLF is not up to
date on its supervision. It is expected that the second tier of supervision
is performed by the financing institution with the aim of helping the bor-
rower identify and resolve any production, financial or managerial problems.
While some of the accredited institutions perform this type of supervision,
others do not. An assurance was obtained during negotiations that in the
future IGLF would regularly monitor the supervision efforts of accredited
institutions, and would provide training in standard follow-up practices and
procedures. The proposed new organizational structure should enable IGLF to
do so.
4.09      Procurement and Disbursements.  IGLF's procurement procedure is
satisfactory. In general, the end-user provides the sponsoring institutions
with a list of items to be acquired. The financial institution checks the
prices quoted as also the suitability of the items. The loan is disbursed by
/1 These guidelines deal with variables such as industries eligible for
financing, the maturity structure of the loan, grace periods and
project location.
/2 Loan disbursement by IGLF is made in two equal installments.



- 26 -
IGLF on the basis of a declaration provided by the accredited institution
that items to be financed are both suitable and reasonably priced. Inter-
views with the active accredited institutions indicated that this procedure
was being followed. In addition, IGLF's end-use verification (para. 4.08)
ensures that the funds have been utilized for the purpose intended. In view
of the large number of projects, the Bank disbursements were made against a
statement of expenses provided by IGLF without requiring further documents.
A post-disbursement audit carried out by the Bank indicated that this pro-
cedure was operating satisfactorily=
Operating Policies
4.10      The broad framework for IGLF's policies is enunciated in CPA 32 and
the Master Agreement (para. 4.01). Over time, however, many of the rules and
regulations have changed. The most important changes were made in 1975 when
the terms of the Bank Loan No. 1120-PH were incorporated. The major changes
were: (a) increasing the interest rate to the participating financial insti-
tution from 5% to 7% and to the end-users from 10% to 12%; (b) introducing
the automatic 60% guarantee scheme; (c) adopting the accreditation scheme;
(d) allowing for the participation of Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries
(NBFI) in the program; and (e) relaxing the debt/equity ratio for projects
being financed from 70:30 to 80:20. Over time other policies were also
relaxed, such as an increase in the grace period allowed on new loans,
limited inclusion of medium-scale industries (with assets of P 1.0-4.0 mil-
lion) and acceptance, in principle, of foreign banks under the accreditation
program. A manual on IGLF's policies and procedures, first prepared and
circulated among participating institutions in October 1976 and subsequently
revised in August 1978, has operated as a useful guide for the participating
institutions.
4.11      While recent policy changes have made the IGLF program more accept-
able to participating institutions, particularly the NBFI, other changes are
required if the program is to reach its full potential. The new policies are
spelled out in a Policy Statement proposed to be adopted by IGLF (Annex 2).
The major operational policy changes discussed in paras 4.29-33 and 4.44 are:
(a)  inclusion of medium-scale industries in the program by raising the
maximum loan size from the present limit of P 500,000 to P 2.5 mil-
lion (paras. 4.29-31);
(b)  increasing the effective interest rate to the end-user of IGLF frorn
13.2% to 14.7-15% (para. 4.33);
(c)  increase in the interest spread allowed to the participating
institutions from 5% to 8% on small industry loans and from 5% to
6% on medium industry loans (para. 4.31);
(d)  adoption of the new guarantee scheme (para. 4.32); and
(e)  introduction of a penalty charge on defaults by end-users
(para. 4.44).



- 27 -
Formal adoption by IGLF of the new Policy Statement is a condition of effec-
tiveness of the proposed loan. Following the adoption of the Statement, IGLF
would prepare by October 30, 1979 a revised manual of its policies and
procedures for the guidance of its own staff and that of the financial
institutions.
The Accreditation Scheme
4.12      Background.  As stated earlier, prior to September 1976, I1,LF
operated a sponsorship scheme. However, during the first Bank appraisal of
IGLF, it was realized that as the level of approvals increased, IGLF staff
resources would be unable to cope with the evaluation and supervision
necessary and, therefore, it was recommended that these funct[ons be decen-
tralized. Hence, the accreditation scheme caine into being. Under this
scheme, IGLF operates as an apex institution and delegates all appraisal and
supervision responsibility to the accredited financial institutions.  IGLF's
own role is confined to providing guidance, when required, and monitoring the
overall performance of the program. For an institution to be eligible for
accreditation, the following criteria must be met: a minimum net equity of
P 500,000; arrears in excess of 120 days not to exceed 15% of IGLF loans
outstanding; a collection ratio on the IGLF portfolio of no less than 70%;
adequate and satisfactory staff to carry out both the institution's normal
business and successfully implement a small industry program. Currently
commercial banks, NBFI engaging in qutasi-banking functions and private
development banks can apply for accreditation status.
4.13      Progress on Accreditation.  After some initial delays the accredi-
tation scheme has made progress and appears to be working satisfactorily. As
of November 30, 1978, 20 institutions had been accredited, of which 10 were
commercial banks; 9 were NBFI and one was a private development bank (see
Annex 3). Applications of six other institutions were pending. Since June
1978, IBRD funds have been made available to only accredited institutions.
As the rural banks predominantly operate in the agricultural sector mostly
making short-term loans and the majority of them were unable to meet the
accreditation crtterta, CB and the Bank agreed that rural banks would not be
eligible for accreditation but could continue to sponsor projects from IGLF
funds but not from the proceeds of IBRD loans./l
4.14      As of November 30, 1978, out of a total of 73 financial institu-
tions eligible for accreditation only 30 had applied. Although the response
to accreditation has not been overwhelming, those institutions that have been
accredited appear to 17e sound and provide a fairly wide geographic reach.
The total number of branches of accredited institutions is 146. Of these,
83% belong to commercial banks, the remaining 17% being branches of NBFI.
The number of branches per region varies greatly from one each for Cagayan
Valley and Central Mindanao to twenty each for Western Visayas, Central
VILsayas and Southerii MLtdaaiao (see Annex 4, T-1).
/1 Rural Banks can avail themselves of IBRD funds through the IBRD Rural
Credit Projects.



4.15      A number of factors are responsible for the apparent lack of
interest of a number of financial institutions in applying for accreditation.
First, the spread and maximum loan size (P 500,000) do not provide institu-
tions, particularly commercial banks, with sufficient financial incentive
(see para. 4.21). Second, many of the financial institutions are not par-
ticularly well informed about IGLF and the accreditation scheme. Third,
owing to the vagueness of some circulars and regulations issued by the
Government/CB regarding money market operations, some financial institutions
maintain that an IGLF loarn might be construed as a deposit substitute a nd
therefore subjected to these regulations./l However, none of the above prob-
lems is insurmountable.  The new policy package and the proposed organiza-
tional changes would, to a large extent, address the first two problems.
During negotiations the Government and CB clarified that the money market
regulations do not apply to IGLF. Some of these clarifications are being
circulated by CB among financial intermediaries.
4.16      To date, CB has implemented the accreditation program quite satis-
factorily. There are, however, a few areas where improvements are needed.
While IGLF should apply the accreditation criteria strictly and uniformly
before granting accreditation status, once accredited, the institution should
have greater freedom than it currently appears to receive in the matter of
project selection and appraisal. Rather than second-guess the accredited
institution's appraisal of a project, IGLF should discuss the overall policies
or issues arising from the project, if deemed necessary, on a post-approval
basis. On the other hand, IGLF does not appear to adequately monitor the
overall performance of financial institutions once accreditation status has
been granted. IGLF should keep in close touch with accredited institutions
and periodically review their performance. Continuation of accreditation
status of an institution should be based on its overall satisfactory perform-
ance regarding the standard of appraisal, adequacy of supervision, institu-
tional capability and quality of portfolio. At negotiations IGLF's policies
and practices vis-a-vis accredited institutions and plans for their regular
implementation were reviewed and were found satisfactory. Under the new
organization structure of the IGLF unit (para. 4.05) these responsibilities
would be assigned to one division.
4.17      Participation of Accredited Institutions.  As was expected, NBFI
have, in general, been far more active than commercial banks. Over the
period August 1976-December 1978, NBFI accounted for 71% of loan approvals by
accredited institutions by value. The corresponding figure for commercial
banks was 27%. Among NBFI, PDCP is the most active and is responsible for
48.8% by value and 58.0% by number of all loans approved by accredited
institutions for the period August 1976 to December 31, 1978. PDCP not
only has long experience in long-term lending but, in addition, has its own
small business program and is, consequently, an efficient conduit for IGLF
resources. Since mid-1978 PISO and Manphil Investment Corporation have also
become active. A number of the other accredited NBFI have recently started
/1 These regulations include a reserve requirement, the minimum size of
deposit substitutes, registration of the deed of assignment with
Security and Exchange Commission and a 35% transaction tax.



- 29 -
SMI lending programs and will expand this program in the near future once
their initial phase is successfully completed and the constraints mentioned
in para. 4.15 are removed.
4.18      The greater participation of NBFI is likely to continue for at
least two reasons. First, unlike most commercial banks, investment houses
have better expertise for undertaking project evaluation. Second, as
investment houses do not have access to low cost resources, such as bank
deposits, the risk-return trade off of the IGLF program is more attractive to
them than to their commerical bank counterparts. The introduction of medium
scale industry into the IGLF program along with a higher interest spread on
small industry loans are likely to make it more attractive to all types of
financial institutions (para. 4.31). It is possible that several new insti-
tutions will apply for accreditation. While IGLF should encourage competent
institutions to apply for accreditation, the quality of institutions accred-
ited and the relationship between them and IGLF is far more important to the
success of the program than the number accredited. It is expected that when
the proposed changes in IGLF's policies are implemented, the 20 institutions
currently accredited will be able to generate sufficient business for IGLF to
achieve its projected targets (see para. 4.45).
B. Operations
Volume of Operations
4.19      Until 1975 IGLF provided loans, in the form of special time deposits
(STD), and when requested guarantees up to 80% of the loan. In accordance
with an agreement /1 with the Bank, IGLF adopted a new guarantee policy in
1975.  Under the policy all STD approved were automatically guaranteed up to
60%.
4.20      Details of IGLF's operatons from July 1, 1974 to December 31, 1978 /2
are given in Annex 4, T-2 and T-3. As of December 31, 1978, cumulative
STD approvals since the establishment of IGLF in 1952 stood at P 319.0 million
for 1,032 projects. About 53% of the approvals in value terms and 76% of the
projects, in terms of number, were financed after June 30, 1974. IGLF's past
operations are characterized by wide yearly fluctuations in the volume of STD
approved:
/1 Under Loan No. 1120-PH.
/2  Until recently, IGLF used to report data on a fiscal year basis
(July 1-June 30), but now presents it on a calendar year basis.

Cumulative total                        1,032                 319.0
Between 1965-74, IGLF's annual approvals amounted to only P 2-3 million.
In 1973 IGLF's procedures and polices were changed resulting in a sharp
increase in the volume of operations in FY75. Owing to institutional and
policy constraints this new level of operations could not be sustained in
subsequent years. The fluctuations in the volume of operations after FY75
were brought about by changes in the type of institutions participating in
the program. Until CY76, commercial banks accounted for 50-60% of IGLF's
approvals, rural banks for 30-40% and other institutions (private development
banks and savings and loan associations) for around 10%. In CY78, commercial
and rural banks and NBFI /1 were responsible for 27%, 3.4% and 54%, respec-
tively of total approvals, the remainder of approvals (16%) coming from PDB
and other institutions.
4.21       Several factors have contributed to the changing structure of
participating financial institutions. First, most commercial banks find that
the 5% gross spread is not sufficient to justify the higher costs and risks
inherent in SM1I lending. In addition, those commercial and rural banks which
had, in the past, actively participated in the program began to experience a
deterioration in the quality of their IGLF portfolio and faced high arrears /2
princially because of weak project evaluation and inadequate supervision.
Despite arrears on their own portfolio, the financial institution is expected
to "make good" to IGLF. In the case of commercial banks the process of making
good ties up their own resources and carries a high opportunity cost./3
/l NBFI were permitted to participate in the program from the third
quarter of 1976.
/2 Approximately 43.2% of commercial bank loans outstanding were in arrears
as of December 31, 1978.
/3 IGLF loans earn an interest of 12%, while comparable loans made directly
by commercial banks bear an interst of 19%.



- 31 -
4.22      In July 1976 the Monetary Board restricted rural bank participation
under the IGLF program by requiring that participating rural banks have a
minimum paid-in capital of P 500,000. The maximum loan size was also
reduced from P 250,000 to P 150,000. The above requirements, coupled
with mountLng arrears on rural bank portfolios, have significantly curtailed
rural bank participation in the IGLF program.
4.23      For reasons explained earlier, NBFI have been particularly active
in the IGLF program and as a result, they have more than compensated for the
reduction in approvals by commercial and rural banks. The proposed policy
changes (paras. 4.29-4.33) are likely to make the program more attractive to
commercial banks and NBFI. A promotional campaign shall be undertaken by
IGLF to publicize these changes.
Characteristics of Operations
4.24      Sectoral Distribution.  Normally only manufacturing industries
are eligible for IGLF financing, though some service and tourism projects
also qualify. Manufacturing activity continues to dominate the sectoral
distribution of IGLF's approvals. In 1978 manufacturing activity accounted
for 94.5% of approvals (by amount) compared to 90.7% in 1977 and 90.9% in
1976. Within the manufacturing sector, miscellaneous manufacturers /1
received 15.6% of total approvals. Other industries receiving 5% or more
of IGLF's approvals for 1978 are nonelectrical machinery/appliances (12.4%),
food and food products (9.1%), wood and cork products (8.1%), textiles (7.8%),
apparel/footwear/garmets (7.7%), metal products (7.2%), furniture and fixtures
(6.9%) and printing, publishing and allied industry (5.3%). Substantial
change in the overall distribution of approvals in the latest two years
occurred in the food and food products sector which increased from 5.8% in
1977 to 9.1% in 1978, textiles which increased from 3.5% to 7.8% and printing,
publishing and allied industry which increased from 0.9% to 5.3%; the percent-
age of total approvals going to the apparel/footwear/garments sector decreased
from 10.9% to 7.7%, metal products from 13.9% to 7.2%, electrical machinery/
appliances from 6.5% to 2.1% and miscellaneous manufactures decreased from
20.6% to 15.6%. Almost all the industrial subsectors financed by IGLF were
labor intensive. Further details of the sectoral breakdown of IGLF's approvals
are given in Annex 4, T-4.
4.25      Regional Distribution.  As shown in Annex 4, T-5, the regional
distribution of IGLF projects has been skewed in favor of Metro-Manila and
adjoining provinces. Despite this, the IGLF portfolio is much less regionally
concentrated than the portfolio of private financial institutions /2 or the
overall distribution of SMI./3 In terms of numbers, the percentage of
/1 Miscellaneous manufacturers comprise handicrafts, agro-business, plastic
and rubber manufacturers.
/2 As of March 1978, 86.7% of all commercial bank credit went to Metro-Manila.
/3 As of 1975, the three regions of Metro-Manila, Central Luzon and Southern
Tagalog accounted for 76% of all industrial establishments in the SMI
sector.



- 32 -
approvals going to Metro-Manila, Central Luzon and Southern Tagalog was 65.0%
for 1978, 71.9% for 1977 and 61.5% for 1976. As of year-end 1978, two
regions, Cagayan Valley, and Western Mindanao, had received no approvals
during the year. In order to bring about greater regional dispersion, IGLF:
(a) has adopted a 40:60 rule with respect to the lending of accredited
institutions, namely, no more than 40% (by number) of an institution's
lending over a six-month period can go to Metro-Manila; and (b) does not
finance any new project in Metro-Manila unless it is export-oriented. As of
December 31, 1978, 36.5% of the year's approvals had gone to Metro-Manila
compared to 35.2% in 1977. One of the reasons for the relative concentration
of IGLF projects in Metro-Manila and adjoining areas is that the more active
NBFI do not have the requisite regional branch network. They are attempting
to deal with this problem by either opening new branches or establishing
tie-ups with regionally located financial institutions. Moreover, once the
commercial banks become active, which is expected, the geographic reach of
the program is likely to improve significantly as commercial banks have a
well-developed branch network.
4.26      Size of Loan.  The terms of Loan No. 1120-PH provided that the
upper limit on IGLF loans could be P 800,000; IGLF, however, has continued
to enforce an upper limit of P 500,000. In June 1978, the Monetary Board
agreed that the P 800,000 limit should be recognized to enable more indus-
tries to use IGLF resources and to permit financial institutions to develop a
more balanced SMI portfolio; approval from NEDA is pending. As shown in
Annex 4, T-6, the average size of loan approvals has been steadily increasing
from P 225,000 in 1976, to P 286,000 in 1977 and P 335,000 for 1978.
The increasing average size is chiefly attributable to general inflation and
to the increased participation of accredited institutions and decreased
participation of rural banks. While rural banks largely concentrate on
smaller loans, NBFI and commercial banks prefer to finance larger loans as
the fixed costs of IGLF loan processing tends to be the same so that the
return to the institution is positively correlated with the size of the loan.
The bias against small loans is expected to be reduced by increasing the
spread in percentage terms accruing to the financial institution on small
loans (para. 4.31).
4.27      Purpose of Loans and Maturities.  In CY78, 82.4% of loan approvals
by value were for fixed assets, leaving 17.6% for working capital financing.
In CY77, 73.6% went to fixed asset financing, 25.8% to working capital finan-
cing and 0.6% was for other purposes.
4.28      At negotiations for Loan 1120-PH it was agreed that the maximum
maturity of IGLF's STD should be 12 years. However, IGLF has continued to
operate on a maximum loan maturity of 10 years and there are relatively few
loans for even that period. In terms of number, working capital loans with
maturities of up to three years accounted for 47.1%, 46.2% and 41.6% in CY76,
CY77 and CY78 respectively. Fixed asset loans with maturities for 3-5 years
have dropped significantly from 32.6% in CY76 to 16.9% in CY78. The drop in
the 3-5 year loan range has been compensated for by an increase in loans in
the 5-10 year range which rose from 20.3% in CY76 to 41.5% in CY78. In 1977,



- 33 -
IGLF perinitted new projects a one-year grace period for working capital loans
and a grace period of two years for fixed asset loans. The current policy of
permitting no grace period for expansion projects which adversely affects
the borrower's liquidity often resulting in defaults was reviewed at nego-
tiations and it was agreed that adequate grace periods will be allowed on all
loans. Further information on the purpose of loans and their maturities is
given in Annex 4, T-6.
C. Proposed Policy Changes
Financing of Medium Scale Industries
4.29      The Government's SMI program was introduced to encourage the develop-
ment of economically viable industries which would contribute to employment
generation, export promotion and regional development. Many small enterprises
came into being as a result of this program and have, in the course of five
years, progressed from the small to the medium industry stage /2. These
industries are in need of further financing if they are to reach their full
potential and make more efficient use of capital and labor.
4.30      DBP is presently the only institutional source of long-term finan-
cing available to medium-scale industries. However, due to institutional
limitations DBP is not able to cater to the credit needs of this entire
sector. Consequently, many medium-scale industries are short of long-term
resources and, are operating by rolling over short term credit, when this is
available, or resorting to the curb-market. Clearly both these practices are
not in the best interest of the enterprise concerned. If medium scale
industries are to be fostered, long-term finance should be made available to
them through IGLF. This move is also likely to reduce the overall risk
incurred by financial institutions on their IGLF portfolio, as the probabil-
ity of defaults is likely to be lower for medium industry than for small
industry. This will make the program more attractive to the financial
institutions.
4.31      Under the new policy framework IGLF would finance both small scale
industries (loans ranging from P 500,000-800,000) and medium-scale industries
(with loans from P 800,000 to P 2.5 million)./3 Loans between P 800,000-
P 2.5 million will be restricted to existing enterprises with a potential
/1 Prior to this date a grace period of one year was allowed to new projects.
/2 A medium-scale industry is defined as one with assets of P 1-4 million.
According to a recent decison of the Monetary Board (September 1977),
IGLF can make loans to export-oriented medium-scale industries, but the
maximum loan size is maintained at P 500,000.
/3 Based on the asset limit of P 4.0 million and a debt/equity ratio
of 60:40. The same limit applies on DBP's financing of medium-scale
industries.



- 34 -
financial institutions do not cater to the needs of medium-scale enterprises
at the expense of small-scale projects. With respect to return, financial
institutions would be allowed a higher spread (8%) on their small industry
lending than on their medium industry (6%) loans. The new guarantee policy,
by affecting the risk involved in the two types of loans, will also providec
the necessary incentive (para. 4.32).
The New Guarantee Scheme
4.32      The 60% automatic guarantee scheme was originally devised to
encourage financial institutions to lend to undercollateralized clients. The
financial institutions, however, have continued to require 100% collaterali-
zation, which often results in a fully collateralized client being forced to
bear an additional cost./l Moreover the present policy does not distinguish
between a guarantee for collateral shortage and for credit risk.  In future,
IGLF will offer two different optional guarantee schenes with the following
features:
(a) Collateral Guarantee will be available for small industry loans
only (up to P 800,000) and will cover the actual collateral
deficiency, up to a maximum of 25% of the loan amount.  This fixed
absolute amounit guarantee will cover first losses to the extent of
the guaranteed amount or the loan amount outstanding, whichever is
lower. The 2% p.a. guarantee fee charged on the outstanding
guaranteed amount will be passed on by the Financial institution
to the end-user.
(b)  Credit risk Guarantee will be issued by IGLF for small as well as
medium industry loans to the extent requested by the accredited
institution. The guarantee would cover a fixed percentage of
the loan amount outstanding but would not exceed 60% for small-
scale industry loans or 40% for loans to medium-scale industries.
In this case, the 2% guarantee fee would have to be absorbed by the
participating institution.
Interest Rates
4.33      As provided under the Loan Agreement No. 1120-PH, the interest rate
on STD charged was raised to 7% for sponsoring institutions and to 13.2%
(including the guarantee fee) for subborrowers. These interest rates were
determined on the basis of the then prevailing interest rate structure which
has subsequently changed after the amendment of the Anti-Usury Law./2 The
effective interest rate currently charged by IGLF, although positive consider-
Lig thre r~eeret [nflatoa rai>e,/3 is well below the rate charged by other
/1  Under the currenlt policy the 2% guarantee fee is borne by the end-
user of TGLF resources.
/2 Until it was amended, the Anti-Usury Law fixed a ceiling of 12% for all
secured loans.
/3 The average inflation rate in the period 1976 to 1978 (September) was
8.8%, while the projected inflation rate is 7%.



- 35 -
financial institutions for long term peso loans to SMI. DBP, the major
alternative source of term financing for small-scale industry, is currently
charging an effective rate /1 of 14-16% with the average being close to
15.5%.  The nominal rate charged by private development banks is 19%.  Given
the cost ot comparable alternative financing, the current low level of
interest charged by IGLF results in two types of distortions: first, between
credit provided by different types of institutions; second, in overal credit
allocation as the rate charged does not reflect the greater inherent risk of
lending to undercollateralized borrowers and the higher administrative cost
per unit lent. The interest rate differential is also partly responsible for
the high level of arrears on IGLF's portfolio (para. 4.43). In addition, it
acts as a major disincentive for commercial bank participation in the program
(para. 4.21). Under the proposed project, the effective interest rate
charged to the end-user will be raised from the 13.2% currently charged to
14.7% (including a service fee of 1.5%) on small industry loans and to 15%
(including a service fee of 1%) on medium industry loans. This increase will
reduce some of the distortions.
D. Impact of the Bank's Assistance to IGLF
Features of Subprojects Financed under Loan No. 1120-PH
4.34      In 1975 a $12.0 million component was included in Bank Loan No.
1120-PH for IGLF/2 which has since been fully utilized by IGLF. Under the
Bank loan, IGLF financed 393 subprojects for P 119 million /3 ($16.1
million) which are estimated to have generated a total investment of
P 227.6 million (Annex 4, T-7).
/1 Originally in 1975, when the Loan No. 1120-PH was made, DBP's interest rate
was 12%. In early 1976, interest on loans not secured by land mortgage
was raised to 14%; the interest rate on loans secured by land mortgage
remained unchanged at 12%. In September 1976, DBP introduced a super-
vision fee of 2% on all loans over P 150,000.
/2 The $30 million loan included four components: IGLF, $12.0 million;
DBP, $15.0 million, the National Electrification Administration's (NEA)
industrial rural cooperative program, $2.3 million and MOI's SBAC program,
$0.7 million. DBP component has been fully disbursed for SMI projects
details of which were reviewed in the "Staff Appraisal Report on Develop-
ment Bank of the Philippines" (No. 1972-PH, dated April 21, 1978).
Utilization of the NEA component has been slow. MOI's SBAC program has
been completed and is working satisfactorily (para. 2.07).
/3 75% ($12.0 million) of this amount is financed by the Bank loan.



- 36 -
The average subloan size of P 302,700 is higher than that expected at
appraisal (P 210,000) owing to the ineligibility of rural banks to use IBRD
funds (para. 4.22). Sixty percent of the projects financed had loans ranging
from P 200,001-500,000 and received 85% of IGLF/IBRD resources. Despite
IGLF's decision in September 1977 to allow certain medium-scale industries to
participate in the program, IGLF lending continues to favor small borrowers;
those with assets of P 500,000 or less accounted for about 73% of IGLF/IBRD
resources while those with assets ranging from P 500,001-P 1 million
accounted for 23%, and those with assets greater than R 1 million accounted
for 4%. Manufacturing activities accounted for 92.3% of the subloans (vs. 98%
expected at the time of appraisal); tourism, other services and construction
accounted for 3.7%, 3.6% and 0.4% of the subloans respectively (Annex 4, T-8).
Within manufacturing, the distribution of Bank funds followed approximately
the same sectoral pattern as projected at appraisal with two exceptions. The
share of food processing was only 5.9% compared to 20.2% expected at appraisal
while miscellaneous manufacturing /1 received 19.9% of Bank funds compared to
a share projected at appraisal to be nominal.  In terms of regional dispersion
the expectations at appraisal have largely been met. As shown in Annex 4,
T-9, Metro-Manila accounts for 37.7% by number (vs. 35.3% projected at the
time of appraisal) and 46.9% by amount of total investment generated (vs.
42.5% projected at the time of appraisal). The degree of concentration in the
Metro Manila area for IGLF/IBRD financed subloans is greater than for IGLF
loans as a whole. This situation has occurred because rural banks, which
normally finance projects in outlying regions, are not eligible for IBRD funds
(para. 4.22). Excluding Metro-Manila, the rest of Luzon accounted for 33.2% of
investment (vs. 30% projected at the time of appraisal); the less developed
regions of Ilocos and Cagayan Valley received a smaller share than expected.
The Visayas received 14.0% of investment as against 15.8% expected at appraisal.
Mindanao also attracted less investment than expected (5.9% vs. 12%). The
distribution of investment is still skewed in favor of the more developed
regions.
Economic Impact of Projects Approved Under Bank Loan No. 1120-PH
4.35      On an ex-ante basis, the 393 subprojects financed under the loan
as of December 31, 1978, have generated a total project cost investment of
about P 228 million ($30.8 million). The estimated incremental sales of
these projects came to P 363.6 million ($49 million) of which export sales
accounted for P 47.8 million ($6.5 million). Firms located in Metro-Manila
accounted for 59% of the exports; Central Luzon came next with 27%. A little
over 44% of the exports were leather and leather products followed by furni-
ture and fixtures with 20%, miscellaneous manufactures with 15%, and footwear,
apparel and garments with 11% and none of the remaining sectors accounted for
more than 4% of export sales. The 393 projects financed are expected to gener-
ate 9,889 new jobs with an investment cost per worker of P 23,012, ($3,110),
which is well below the Bank's urban poverty threshold of $3,900 (1978) for
the Philippines. In terms of size of subborrowers, almost 100% of the Bank
/1 Miscellaneous manufacturers comprise handicrafts, agro-business and
plastic/rubber manufactures.



- 37 -
loan went to subborrowers with fixed assets below $250,000 /1 at the time of
application to IGLF.
4.36      In 1978, a special study to evaluate the economic impact of the
IBRD/IGLF program on an ex-post basis was conducted.  This study /2 found
that the 187 firms studied directly employed 5,703 workers, or an average of
30 workers per firm. A typical industry in this group required an average
capital investment of P 16,000 ($2,162) per worker.  The investmeat cost per
worker ranged from P 5,000 ($676) in the case of fiber products to P 73,000
($9,865) for rubber products. Among the subsectors, rubber products, cold
storage, feed mills and chemicals were found to be more capital-intensive
than printing, shell products, fiber products and furniture. The labor
intensity of the miscellaneous manufacturers group was also very evident since
this group, comprising small handicrafts and shellcraft employed 16% of all
workers.  Net value added by these firmTs amounited to P 30.5 million, corres-
ponding to 65% of total IGLF funding. The value added component consists of
wages (68.5%), profit and financial expenses (31.5%) which further reflects
the labor-intensity of IGLF-financed projects.
4.37      The ratios of net profit to total investment realized in 1977 for
the entire group of 187 firms ranged from 0.7% for rubber products to 101.5%
for paper products, the average being 28%. The economic rates of return have
niot been calculated for all the subprojects owing to the smnall size of the
loans (para. 4.07). However, on an a priori basis, the economic rate of
return is likely to be high given the labor intensity of most projects and
the utilization of local raw materials.  The economic rates of return have,
however, been computed for a sample of 30 projects and canged from 17.2% for
a furniture project to 215.5% for a garment industry (Annex 4, T-10). The
average economic rate of return in the sample was 59%.
E. Financial Position and Performance
Financial Position
4.38      Even though IGLF is not an institution but a fund, CB maintains
financial statements for purposes of control. IGLF's balance sheets as of
December 31, 1974 through 1978 are summarized in Annex 4, T-11. IGLF's total
assets as of December 31, 1978 stood at P 162.4 million, having increased
almost threefold since December 31, 1974. STD and short-term investments
account for almost 95% of total assets. Investments represent the short-termn
placements of IGLF's liquid resources held to finance Future disbursements of
STD and possible losses against guarantees. The increase in assets since
1974 was almost entirely financed by drawdowns on Bank Loan No. 1120-PH and
Government funds.  As of December 31, 1978 the outstanding balance of the

andli Sn:all-Scale FEnterprise Development" (No. 1543 dated March 22, 1977).
/2 Confined to 187 projects which had received IBRD-IGLF financing as of
June 30, 1977.



- 38 -
Bank loan (P 59.6 million) and Government funds (P 75.4 million), inclu-
ding retained profits, together accounted for about 85.2% of total assets.
The outstanding balance of the US EXIM Bank loan (P 21.0 million) and other
liabilities (P 0.5 million) accounted for the remaining assets. As of
December 31, 1978, IGLF's financial position was strong with a debt/ equity
ratio of 1.1:1 and a very high current ratio. As of the same date, IGLF's
total liquid and near liquid assets (cash and short-term investments)
covered outstanding undisbursed commitments around 15 times. Provisions for
possible losses are made annually and amounted to P 2.5 million or 2.2% of
outstanding STD as of December 31, 1978.
Financial Results
4.39      Summarized income statements of IGLF are given in Annex 4, T-12.
IGLF derives its gross income in the form of interest on STD, income from
short-term investments and the guarantee fee, the first two sources account-
ing for the bulk of its income. Since currently the spread accruing to IGLF
on IBRD funded STD is only 0.625%, their contribution to IGLF's overall
profitability is marginal. However, with the growth in STD the interest
income from them has increased steadily from P 1.0 million in 1974 to
P 2.0 million in 1975, P 3.8 million in 1976, P 3.9 million in 1977 and
P 4.3 million in 1978. However, the largest contribution to gross income
since 1976 has come from short-term investments; this element is likely to
decline in the future as surplus funds are used for STD financing. IGLF's
net income reached a record high of P 3.1 million in 1976 but declined
to P 1.8 million in 1977 due to: a sharp increase in the interest on the
Bank loan; and a provision of P 0.6 million made in 1977 for doubtful
accounts. Moreover, since IGLF's financial statements are prepared on a cash
basis, the increase in arrears was directly responsible for the decrease in
net income in 1977. In 1978 IGLF's net income rose to P 2.8 million
largely owing to higher income derived from STD and short term investments.
Overall, IGLF appears to be reasonably profitable.
Audit
4.40      IGLF's accounts are audited every year by CB's Office of the Internal
Auditor (OIA) /1 as a part of the general audit of DLC. The Bank Loan Agree-
ment No. 1120-PH requires that IGLF's accounts be separately audited; the
first separate audit report on IGLF was prepared by the OIA on 1977 accounts.
While the report provided a basis for an independent verification of IGLF's
financial status, it did not focus sufficiently on the quality of IGLF's port-
folio. OIA has agreed to address this problem in its future audits. In
addition, the OIA has agreed, in future, to prepare IGLF's accounts on an
accrual basis so as to more accurately reflect IGLF's financial position.
/1 OIA operates under the functional control of the Commission on Audit, a
Government body that audits all Government accounts.

Quality of Portfolio
4.41      IGLF's Portfolio.  Between December 31, 1974 and December 31,
1978, IGLF's total STD portfolio grew at an average annual rate of about 29%.
As of December 31, 1978 STD outstanding amounted to P 114.0 million. The
outstanding STD were held by: commercial banks (38.6%), rural banks (17.8%),
NBFI (25.0%), PDB (13.3%) and others (5.3%). The share of NBFI in the
IGLF program is likely to increase in the future while that of rural banks is
likely to decline. Arrears on the IGLF portfolio have increased sharply.
Over the period, September 30, 1975 to December 31, 1978, IGLF's arrears
have increased from P 1.0 million to P 18.3 million; as percentage of STD
outstanding, arrears rose from 2.2% to 16.0%. Rural banks accounting for
17.8% of IGLF portfolio were responsible for 39% of the arrears. Even
allowing for their rather recent participation, the arrears ratio for NBFI is
remarkably low (at 0.2%) as is the arrears ratio for accredited banks.
Details of IGLF's portfolio are given in Annex 4, T-13 and 14.
4.42      Participating Institutions' IGLF Portfolio.  In compliance with the
requirement of Loan Agreement No. 1120-PH, CB now collects arrears data on
the IGLF portfolio of participating institutions. As expected, the incidence
of arrears on the portfolio of the participating institutions is much higher
than on IGLF's own portfolio. As of December 31, 1978, total arrears
between financial institutions and subborrowers on IGLF loans averaged
23.8% of total loans outstanding while 41.9% of the portfolio was affected by
arrears (Annex 4, T-15). The arrears ratio varies significantly by type of
institutions: rural banks have an arrears ratio of 54.9%, commercial banks
of 43.2%, PDB of 26.7% and NBFI of 1.6%. The growing NBFI participation
would result in a better portfolio in the future.
4.43      The deterioration in the quality of IGLF's own portfolio and that
of participating financial institutions is symptomatic of the past and
present weaknesses in IGLF's operating policies. First, before the introduc-
tion of the Bank program, emphasis was placed on increasing the number of
participating institutions with little attention being paid to their ability
to handle SMI lending. While this policy was changed with the introduction
of the accreditation program (para. 4.12), IGLF will continue to face collec-
tion problems on its old portfolio. Second, IGLF does not permit a penalty
rate to be changed to end-users which sometimes results in a willful diversion
of funds. Third, participating institutions are normally required to repay
IGLF irrespective of their own collection. In the absence of a penalty charge
"making good" has a high cost (para. 4.21). Therefore, many commercial banks
prefer defaulting on their IGLF loans, particularly as CB has been reluctant
to debit the account of a commercial bank in default to IGLF on grounds that
it would discourage commercial bank participation in the program. Fourth,
IGLF's policy of not allowing a grace period on loans for expansion projects
has often resulted in borrowers being genuinely unable to repay.
4.44      As the increase in arrears on the IGLF portfolio is a serious
matter, a number of steps have been proposed to improve the situation. An
understanding was reached during negotiations with the Government and CB on
an action program to alleviate this problem. The elements of the action



- 40 -
program are (a) increase in interest rate on IGLF loans (para. 4.33); (b)
introduction of a penalty charge of 5%; (c) changing the policy on grace
periods (para. 4.28); and (d) monitoring more closely the quality of
appraisals and supervision done by participating institutions as well as
their portfolio. IGLF is also undertaking a special program of reviewing the
portfolio of individual financial institutions and taking the necessary
action with respect to restructuring, additional financing or foreclosure.
Moreover, the lengthy procedures currently followed by IGLF for loan re-
structuring are being rationalized (para. 40Q3)   Finally, the accounts of
participating institutions in arrears shall in future be automotically
debited by CB after a grace period of 45 days if no remedial plan has been
suggested.
E. Prospects
IGLF's Business Prospects and Projections
4.45      The volume of transactions undertaken by IGLF does not, in any way,
reflect the macro-economic demand for long term resources by small-scale
industry. Until recently institutional problems and inadequate policies have
constrained IGLF's lending. Most of these constraints have been, or are in
the process of being, removed. The volume of IGLF operations rose signifi-
cantly in CY78 and the trend is likely to continue. The inclusion of medium-
scale industry is likely to further boost IGLF's operations. Based on the
guestimates of the more active accredited institutions, IGLF has projected its
volume of operations for CY79 to CY82 (Annex 4, T-16). The volume of new
approvals is projected to be as follows:

industries, IGLF intends to increasingly emphasize project selection . A



- 41 -
program of cooperation between accredited institutions and CSMI is being
initiated to ensure that deserving small and medium industries receive the
necessary finance. The export element and employment potential of projects
will be criteria for project financing, but other variables, such as regional
dispersion of investment, value added and use of indigenous material, will
also be considered. IGLF would encourage participating institutions to give
priority to small industries. IGLF also aims at building the organizational
staff capacity of accredited institutions so that a core of credit institutions
is developed capable of efficiently handling SMI projects. However, IGLF's
financing will continue to be confined to manufacturing and some service sectors.
Resource Requirements
4.47      Details of IGLF's resource position are given in Annex 4, T-17.
Historically, IGLF's resources have come from USAID counterpart funds,
Government contributions, US EXIM Bank loans and, since 1975, the Bank Loan
No. 1120-PH. As of December 31, 1978, IGLF's net resources available for
commitments stood at P 54.7 million. Between January 1979 and June 1981,
IGLF's projected new commitments amount to P 305 million /1 which it
expects to meet as under:
P million
Balance resources as of December 31, 1978        54.7

Total                                      305.0
IGLF has fully committed and disbursed the allocation ($12 million) made for
it under the first Bank loan. Based on its projected level of new approvals
IGLF would exhaust all its resources in the beginning of the third quarter of
1979 when new resources including the proposed Bank loan would be needed.
The proposed Bank loan would be used to finance STD to accredited institu-
tions. At negotiations, the Government agreed to make needed resources
available to IGLF.
Financial Projections
4.48      IGLF's projected balance sheets for CY79-82 are given in Annex 4,
Table 18. The increase in IGLF's STD disbursements, which commenced in
FY78 is likely to continue, particularly with the inclusion of medium
industry financing. Total assets are projected to rise from P 162.4 million
in CY78 to P 337.5 million in CY80, and P 464.8 million in CY82, or an
average annual growth rate of about 30%. The actual growth rate achieved in
the past five years has been about 25%. The proposed additional contribution
of P 50 million by the Government in CY79 will enable IGLF to maintain a

satisfactory degree of liquidity; the debt service coverage is estimated to
range between 3.5 times and 3.9 times. IGLF's projected cash flow is given in
Annex 4, Table T-19.
4.49      IGLF's projected income statements for CY79-82 are shown in Annex 4,
T-20. The anticipated increase in STD will be reflected in gross income
which is projected to rise from P 10.1 million in CY78 to P 22.8 million
in CY80 and P 34.7 million in CY82, raising the net income from P 2.8 million
in CY79 to P 5.6 million in CY80 and P 8.0 million in CY82. Since the fee /1
charged by CB for administering IGLF is a major factor affecting the profit-
ability of IGLF, an understanding was reached that any increase in the adminis-
tration fee will be in line with the actual increase in expenses and with
prior consultations with the Bank.
/1 Currenlty it is 1% of the highest outstanding balance of STD and guarantees
in the preceding year.

5. THE MEDIUM AND SMALL INDUSTRIES COORDINATED
ACTION PROGRAM (MASICAP)
Origins and Aims of the Program
5.01      The MASICAP program was established by the Development Academy of
the Philippines in November 1973, and transferred to MOI in June 1974. The
aim of the program is to stimulate investment in small and medium industries
in regions outside Metro-Manila; this objective is achieved by assisting SMI
in the preparation of projects which might be financed from the entrepreneurs
own resources, or through institutional credit. The program was implemented
to address two major constraints affecting SMI: (a) the growing concentration
of industrial investment and output in the M4etro-Manila region, and (b) lack
of awareness on the part of most SMI businesses outside Metro-Manila of the
investment opportunities and credit facilities available to them. The program
complements the SBAC (para 2.07).
Organization
5.02      The program emphasizes field work and extension services.  At
present, the MASICAP staff number 147, of whom 137 are field staff orvanized
into 49 teams of 2 to 3 persons. Each teamn is assigned a specific geographic
area usually comprising 1 or 2 provinces. MASICAP's geographic coverage is
extensive and covers almost all the regions of the country except Metro Manila.
Each team has a senior team leader in charge of initiating and screening
projects; the 10 headquarters staff also travel extensively to administer and
supervise the program.  MASICAP teams do not haxre permanent office premises
in the regions but use SBAC offices wherever possible.
5.03      A key feature of the staffing policies of MASICAP is the emphasis
placed on the recruitment of students from colleges and universities wishing
to participate in the program./l The senior year students recruited tend to
have an outstanding academic record and are given two year appointments with
a phased intake of newly trained field staff. Only four positions (all at
headquarters) are permanent. Training to the new recruits is provided by
senior team leaders, and through lectures from representatives of the govern-
ment and financial institutions.
5.04      The rationale behind the staffing policy is to maintain a high
degree of motivation in the program. Although not an explicit objective,
this staffing policy has been low cost relative to the size and geographic
reach of the program. MASICAP services are provided free of cost to the

end-user. Expenditures in the first five years were P 12.8 million, which
amounts to P 2,500 per project feasibility study conducted or less than 3% of
amounts loaned (or in the process of being loaned) by banks, or less than 2%
of the amounts actually invested in the projects.
Method of Operation
5.05      While MASICAP, extends assistance to any small enterprise, priority
is given to investment in the industrial sector. Business is generated
through contacts with financial institutions, local businessmen, local govern-
ments, and business and trade associations. The decision to accept or reject
a project study is taken by the senior team leader. The average time taken by
MASICAP to prepare a project feasibility study is about one man month. During
this time, information necessary for a feasibility study is gathered. In addi-
tion, the entrepreneur is helped in finance (making cash flow projections,
computing working capital requirements and estimating the project's debt
repayment capacity), marketing and accounting. The MASICAP agent also
helps the entrepreneur in preparing loan requests for institutional credit.
Operational Record
5.06       Since the program began, MASICAP has undertaken over 5,300 feasi-
bility studies of which 77% (4,090) were submitted for financing, 11% were
discontinued, 7% were submitted for licenses and 5% were shelved or are still
being processed (Annex 4, T-21). Of the 4,090 submitted for financing, 21%
(851) were screened and rejected without appraisal by financial institutions;
52% (2,135) were appraised and approved; 6% (235) were appraised but rejected;
the remaining 21% projects are awaiting a decision. Annex 4, T-22, provides
some of this information on a yearly basis, and shows that the pace of the
program has been maintained. Currently, about 1,200 projects are reviewed
each year which is lower than the peak of 1,525 projects in 1976. The
slowdown has occurred because MASICAP is now concentrating on the smaller
towns and villages/l where project generation is more difficult and time-
consuming. The average loan and project size of MASICAP clients is F 225,000
and P 450,000 respectively; while the volume of lending and investment
generated is currently about P 135 million and P 270 million respectively.
In general, larger projects are directly appraised by the financial institu-
tions, while MASICAP help is sought for smaller loans, where the transaction
cost per unit lent is high.
5.07      The major sources of financing for MASICAP-assisted projects have
been: DBP which appraised 72% (2,336) of the loan requests submitted,/2 IGLF
which appraised 13% (411), while other financial institutions accounted for
the remaining 15%. The relatively low volume of IGLF financing occurred as a

- 45 -
result of the lengthy processing time taken by IGLF prior to the introduction
of the accreditation scheme in 1976. In addition, MASICAP has worked extensively
on loans which, in general, have been too small to qualify for IGLF financing.
Performance of MASICAP Projects
5.08      A monitoring survey undertaken in 1976 of 50% of MASICAP Projects
found that while 87% of the projects were still operating, 40% were in
arrears by more than three months, and 28% in arrears by more than six
months./l There are several reasons for these arrearages. First, MASICAP
clients tend to be new businesses with little or no track record and are
consequently much more difficult to assess than the proven businesses with
which financial institutions normally deal. Recently, it has been decided
that MASICAP should concentrate more on "growth" enterprises, i.e., those
which have been in operation but need financing for expansion; implementation
of this decision should reduce the risk of default. Second, at that stage
the financial institutions (especially DBP) were inexperienced in the appraisal
and supervision of small loans. Third, MASICAP was also inexperienced, and
there was a tendency for the cash flow projections to be unrealistically
optimistic, and consequently the projects were unable to meet their debt
service. Insufficient supervision of MASICAP teams by experienced profes-
sionals further contributed to weak project studies. With more experience and
the implementation of the proposed organizational changes the quality of
project feasibility studies is likely to improve.
Strength and Weaknesses of the Program
5.09      The main strength of MASICAP is the motivation to try and address
problems which the organized financial sector is unwilling to tackle on its
own. The main weakness of the program has been the lack of experience and
continuity. The procedure of replacing field staff members after two years
of service has meant that experience gained has not been retained within the
program; staff tend to leave the program just when they have developed some
expertise in project identification and knowledge of local conditions. In
some cases, this has adversely affected the quality of projects developed by
MASICAP. Unfortunately, MASICAP does not follow-up the projects assisted by
it; this is left entirely to the financial institutions. As MASICAP is
unaware of the final outcome of the projects developed, the impact of learning
by doing is significantly curtailed.
Proposed Changes
5.10      The project aims to reinforce MASICAP by introducing some continuity
in its operations. It is proposed to (a) introduce permanent experienced
technical staff with nine regional offices to supervise the work of MASICAP
/1 Arrears as a proportion of principal affected was 8% while arrears as a
proportion of all MASICAP-generated loans was 4%.



- 46 -
teams; and (b) involve MASICAP field staff in the supervision of projects.
As in the past, a small sample of projects will be monitored annually. The
monitoring will be organized by headquarter's staff who will also perform
their current administrative functions.
5.11      There are to be three permanent staff in each region who will be
responsibile for project identification, feasibility studies and the super-
vision activities of the field staff consisting of four to seven teams headed
by a permanent senior team leader. The selection and training of staff will
be the responsibility of headquarters. The organizational arrangements are
shown in Annex 4, C-3.
5.12      The supervision provided by MASICAP will be on a regularized
basis /1 and will involve brief but periodic visits to clients having
received assistance to discuss progress and problems. To avoid duplication
of efforts, MASICAP's supervision of projects would be closely coordinated
with the similar activities of the financial institutions. MOI will keep
the Bank informed of its supervision and monitoring activities through
regular periodic reporting.
5.13      Over the two-year period, July 1, 1979 to June 30, 1981, the total
MASICAP cost is estimated at P 8.9 million including the additional capital
expenditure required to establish the 9 permanent regional offices and per-
sonnel and other operating expenses. Of the total project cost, the proposed
Bank loan would finance up to P 3.7 million, while the balance of the
project cost would be covered by annual budgets of MOI. The Bank loan
would finance 100% of the capital costs relating to imported/locally manufac-
tured items such as vehicles, office equipment and furniture and 50% of staff
training and the salaries of the additional permanent professional staff for
the initial two years.
/1 The monitoring system will be organized separately, and will not involve
the regular MASICAP technical staff in the regions.

6. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Objectives and Justification of the Proposed Loan
6.01      Besides resource transfer, the two major objectives of the proposed
loan are: continued Bank participation in the Government's SMI program which
is aimed at reducing income disparities; and further developing the expertise
of institutions in SMI project evaluation. From the proposed loan of $25.0
million, $24.5 million will be used for onlending by IGLF to the SMI sector
while the balance, $0.5 million, will be utilized by MOI for strengthening
M4ASICAP. Over 510 SMI projects are expected to be financed under the loan,
with a total investment of about P 325 million.
6.02      A major component of the Government's SMI program has been to
upgrade and increase the number of institutions supplying term credit to SMI.
Since the Bank's participation /1 in the program in 1975 considerable success
has been achieved. The proposed loan would ensure continued availability of
term credit to SMI. At present, DBP is the only source of term credit
available to medium-scale industries. Several of the successful enterprises
now fall into the medium-scale category. These enterprises will need to be
financed if they are to reach their full potential. Hence, the proposed IGLF
loan will provide financing for both small- and medium-scale industries.
6.03      The economic and social benefits resulting from the project are
likely to be substantial, Most significantly, the project will: provide
credit to groups that are normally denied access to term credit; generate
employment at a relatively low cost in both rural and urban areas; bring
about a greater regional dispersal of investment; and aid in the institu-
tional development of several financial institutions. Since the projects to
be financed cannot, at this stage, be identified it is not possible to make an
ex-ante analysis of the economic impact of the loan. However, given the
high level of unemployment in the Philippines, the heavy reliance of SSEs on
locally produced inputs and the low level of protection enjoyed by most
SSEs, the average economic rate of return on investment is likely to be
significant. The average economic rate of return of a sample of projects
under the first loan was 59% (para. 4.37) and a similar return is likely under
this project.
6.04      In accordance with the Government's social and economic priorities,
the loan will be supporting labor-intensive industries. The projects
financed under the IGLF loan component will create approximately 11,500 new
jobs at an average cost per job of about $3,820. The average cost per job
under the proposed loan will, inevitably, be higher than under the previous
loan ($3,041) as medium-scale industries will also be eligible. However,
the cost per job will be far lower than in the Philippine modern industrial
/1 Bank financing for Philippine SMI amounts to $85.0 million.

sector and well within the Bank determined urban poverty threshold for the
Philippines./l Over 65% of the projects under the proposed loan would be
located outside Metro-Manila, thus aiding the geographical dispersion of
industry.
6.05      Finally, the loan will help develop expertise in project evaluation
and preparation. On the institutional side, accredited financial institutions
are building up their expertise in this field. Moreover, a restructured
MASICAP will aid potential end-users in preparing project feasibility studies.
A part of the loan will be used to equip MASICAP with a core of permanent
professional staff in charge of monitoring the program. This is likely to
improve the quality of MASICAP's output which will help in the promotion of
economically and financially viable SMI projects.
Features of the Loan
6.06      Purpose.  The IGLF loan component would be used to finance fixed
assets and the permanent working capital of SMI subprojects. As under the
previous loan, the proceeds of the proposed loan would cover 75% of the finan-
cing provided by IGLF to accredited financial institutions while the remaining
25% will come from Government funds. The 75% represents the direct and
indirect foreign exchange component of these projects./2 In order to ensure
that projects are not concentrated in the Metro-Manila area only, IGLF
requires that accredited institutions approve at least 60% of their loans for
projects outside Metro-Manila. As accredited institutions will now be able
to finance both small and medium industry loans, safeguards in the form of
higher spreads and guarantee cover for small loans have been provided to
ensure continued availability of IGLF funds for small projects (para. 4.31).
The MASICAP component of the loan amounting to $500,000 will be used by MOI
to provide MASICAP with field offices and a core of permanent experienced
staff who will be responsible for monitoring and upgrading the quality of
MASICAP output. MASICAP is playing a vital role in promoting SSE particu-
larly in the less well developed regions. The proposed loan by strengthening
the supervisory level staff of MASICAP would make it a more effective program.
The loan component for MASICAP would be used to finance the direct and
indirect foreign exchange cost of capital items (equipment, furniture and
vehicles) to be procured locally and 50% of the salaries of the additional
permanent professional staff and staff training cost for the initial two years.
6.07      Projects Financed and the Bank's Urban Poverty Program.  One of the
major objectives in the establishment of IGLF was the promotion of medium
and small-scale industries. However, until recently, IGLF has concentrated
/1 After allowing for inflation, the urban poverty threshold for the
Philippines will be about $4,400 in 1980.
/2  An analysis of the cost of SMI done in 1977 indicated that, on average,
the direct and indirect foreign exchange component of projects was about
58% in the Philippines. Since it is expected that the accredited financial
institutions will finance about 75% of the project cost, the 75% of IGLF
financing provided by IBRD will represent the direct and indirect foreign
exchange component of the project.



- 49 -
on small industry only. Under the proposed loan medium-scale industries
will also be financed. It is expected that about 80% of the IGLF loan
component will be used to finance small industries and labor-intensive medium
industries with either fixed assets not exceeding $250,000 or projects with
an investment cost per job no greater than $4,400, which is the Bank's
estimated urban poverty threshold for the Philippines for 1980.
6.08      Form of Lending.  As in the previous loan, the proposed loan for
$25 million would be made to the Government which would relend the proceeds to
IGLF ($24.5 million) and to MOI ($0.5 million).
6.09      Currencies and Foreign Exchange Risk.  As virtually all the goods
to be financed under the proposed loan would be locally procured, the subloans
advanced by IGLF will be made in local currency. The portion earmarked for
MASICAP would also primarily finance local currency expenditures. The foreign
exchange risk on the loan would be borne by the Government.
6.10      Amortization Schedule.  Since the number of subloans under the IGLF
component will be large (about 510), for the sake of administrative conven-
ience a fixed amortization schedule stretching over 20 years including a
five-year grace period is recommended. The maximum maturity of SMI loans
under the IGLF component would be 12 years including a maximum grace period of
three years. The shorter maturity of subloans would generate a revolving
fund which IGLF would use for re-lending to SMI on the same terms and condi-
tions as the original loan. It is expected that the proceeds of the entire
loan would be committed in two years and disbursed within three years of the
signing of the loan (Annex 4, T-23).
6.11      Procurement.  The Bank's normal requirements for international
competitive bidding would be inappropriate for application to the subprojects
financed under this loan. Procurement procedures prescribed by IGLF for
use by the accredited institutions are adequate to ensure that purchases from
the subloans are made with due regard to efficiency and economy (para. 4.09).
In the case of MASICAP, the Government's procurement procedures which the
Bank has found satisfactory would be applied for the procurement of capital
assets (office equipment, fixtures and vehicles).
6.12      Free Limit.  Considering the large number of subprojects expected
to be financed and the desirability of keeping the processing time of subpro-
jects to a minimum, it is recommended that no free limit mechanism be used.
Instead, IGLF will periodically submit summary statements of loans approved
as well as copies of appraisals of subloans over P 500,000 which will be
reviewed on a post-approval basis. This procedure, which has been used for
all Bank funded SMI projects in the Philippines, has proved an effective way
of upgrading the quality of appraisals while keeping the processing time to a
minimum.
6.13      Subloan Sizes.  Small industry loans will range from a minimum
of P 50,000 to a maximum of P 800,000 while medium industry loans will range
from P 800,000-P 2.5 million. The present ceiling on IGLF loans would be
correspondingly raised from P 500,000 to P 2.5 million.



- 50 -
6.14      Relending and Onlending Rates.  As with the past IBRD loan to
IGLF, the Government will re-lend the loan to IGLF at the actual borrowing
rate. IGLF would onlend these resources to accredited financial institutions
at 6.7% for small industry loans and at 9% for medium industry loans./l
6.15      Spread to Accredited Financial Institutions under IGLF.  The
effective interest rate to the end-user will be 14.7% (including a service
fee of 1.5%) on small industry loans and 15% (including a service fee of
1.0%) on medium industry loans. This would result in a spread to the
accredited financial institution of 8% and 6% for small and medium scale
loans respectively. A higher spread on small industry loans is proposed to
encourage accredited financial institutions to lend to small industry.
Agreements and Understandings Reached at Negotiations
6.16      During negotiations the Bank reached agreement:
(a) with the Government on the adoption of new IGLF policies prior to
the effectiveness of the loan (para. 4.11); and
(b) with CB on furnishing the Bank with a periodic summary of loans
made by IGLF along with copies of appraisals of subloans exceeding
P 500,000 (para. 6.12), and arrears data on IGLF funded loan
between financial institutions and end-users (para. 4.44).
6.17      In addition, at negotiations the Bank reached understandings
with the Government and CB on:
(a) further delegation of authority to CEO of IGLF authority to handle
routine matters (para. 4.03);
(b) the reorganization of IGLF unit and appropriate staffing
(paras. 4.05 and 4.06);
(c) the calculation of ERR and FRR in appraisal of subloans over
e 1.5 million (para. 4.07);
(d) the preparation of a revised policy manual for IGLF (para. 4.10);
(e) an exemption of IGLF financed loans from the requirements set out
in CB/Government circulars and regulations governing money
market operations (para. 4.15);
(f) an ongoing monitoring of the performance of accredited institutions
by IGLF (para. 4.16);
/1 Based on the Bank's current lending rate of 7.9% this would give IGLF a
net margin of 0.8% on small industry loans and 3.1% on medium industry
loans financed under the proposed Bank loan; IGLF would use interest-free
government funds for financing 25% of each subloan.



- 51 -
(g) a program to review the IGLF's portfolio of participating financial
institutions (para. 4.44);
(h)  the adequacy of CB's fee for administering IGLF (para. 4.49);
(i)  the reorganization of MASICAP (para. 5.10);
(j)  the subfission to the Bank by MOl of quarterly reports on MASICAP
(para. 9.12); and
(k)  the use oF at least 80% of the IGLF loan component for financing
suhprojects with: a cost per job created no greater than the
Baak's urban poverty guidelines; or with fixed assets at the time
of loani applicatton not exceeding $250,000 (para. 6.07).
Recommendatioa
6.t1      A Bank loan of $25 million, for a term of 20 years including 5 years
of grace, is recommended to be made to the Government of the Philippines to
finance the IGLF program and the reorganization and reorientation of MASICAP.

INDUSTRIAL GUARANTEE AND LOAN FUND
Proposed Policy Statement
IGLF's Role
1.        The Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund (IGLF) shall seek to
encourage and promote the establishment and expansion of economically
sound small- and medium-sized industries (SMI) in the Philippines that will
contribute to economic development and an equitable distribution of income in
the country. To this end, IGLF will provide assistance in the form of loans
and guarantees to SMI. IGLF's Review Committee, in cooperation with the
agencies and ministries represented on it and participating financial institu-
tions, will also undertake, as and when necessary and possible, special
promotional campaigns to encourage SMI to make use of IGLF's facility.
Channels of Assistance
2.        In order to ensure accessibility to its facility for SMI, IGLF
will use financial institutions as intermediaries. IGLF will encourage
participating institutions to play an active role in the promotion and
development of SMI and to acquire and develop resources and institutional
capability.
3.        A participating institution must be accredited by IGLF before it
can use the facility. The accreditation criteria will be as follows:
(a) minimum paid-in capital of P 500,000;
(b) sound and efficient management and an adequate number of qualified
staff;
(c) capability for undertaking satisfactory appraisal and effective
supervision of SMI projects;
(d) an overall level of arrearages of over four months not exceeding
15% of the total outstanding loan portfolio of the institution;
with regard to the institution's IGLF portfolio, for the immdiately
preceding financial year, loan collections shall be no less than
70% of accounts overdue and falling due in that year; and
(e) no arrears outstanding to the Central Bank/IGLF.
4.        The types of financial institutions that can apply for accreditation
under IGLF include, but are not restricted to, commercial banks, private
development banks, non-bank financial intermediaries, and other thrift banks.

Page 2
5.        It is understood that an accredited bank will at all times
meet the foregoing criteria. IGLF will undertake a review of the performance
of each accredited institution at least once within a 12-month period to
ensure that the criteria are met.
6.        The IGLF will, in addition to monitoring the overall perform-
ance of the accredited institution, assist accredited institutions in
improving the quality of their SMI operations.  This assistance will be in
the form of, but not confined to, improving the quality of appraisal and
supervision work by divising and installing appropriate procedures and
standards.
7.        In view of the nature of their operations and resources, rural
banks will not be required to be accredited to be eligible for IGLF financing.
Project Selection Criteria
8.        Only viable productive SMI projects will be eligible for IGLF
financing. The factors that will be considered in determining the viability
of projects will include inter alia: economic, technical and financial
viability; impact on the country's balance of payments; regional dispersion
of investment; employment impact; equity in income distribution; and compli-
ance with the Government's overall economic policies and other regulations.
Decisions on the financing of individual projects will be based on overall
merits; non-compliance with any of the aforementioned factors will not
necessarily disqualify a project.
Eligibility Requirement
9.        Projects in manufacturing industries and Government-approved
tourist inns outside Metro-Manila will be eligble under IGLF. Total assets
of the applicant firm at the time of applying to IGLF shall be eP 4.0 mil-
lion or less.
10.       The proceeds of IGLF Loans may be used for financing the purchase
of factory sites, construction of buildings used for business purposes,
purchase and installation of machinery, equipment and fixtures and working
capital. IGLF will not provide assistance for refinancing purposes except
under exceptional circumstances.
Financial Policies
11.       IGLF's loan assistance will be in the form of compensatory financ-
ing provided to participating institutions up to 100% of their loans to SMI.

Page 3
Financial Policies
12.       The upper limit for this financing is P 2.5 million.  IGLF loans up
to P 800,000 will be construed as small industry loans and those from
P 800,000 - P 2.5 million as medium industry loans. Medium industry loans
will be restricted to existing enterprises showing satisfactory performance.
13.       The participating institutions will charge interest at no less
than 13.2% per annum plus a service charge of 1.5% per annum on small industry
loans and no less than 14% per annum plus a service charge of 1% per annum on
medium industry loans made with IGLF funding and shall be allowed a minimum
interest spread of 8% on small industry loans and 6% on medium industry
loans. In addition to setting a higher interest spread on small industry
loans, IGLF, in the process of monitoring the performance of participating
institutions, shall emphasize the importance of providing finance for
small industry.
14.       The maximum maturity of eligible loans will be 12 years, including
a grace period of up to 3 years. For determining grace period, no distinction
will be made between new and expansion projects; actual loan maturities will
be determined on the basis of the project's anticipated cash-flow.
15.       IGLF will offer the following two optional guarantee schemes:
(a) Collateral Guarantee available for small industry loans
to cover collateral deficiency up to an amount equal to 25%
of the loan. This fixed absolute amount guarantee will
cover first losses to the extent of the guarantee or the
loan amount outstanding, whichever is lower; and
(b) Credit risk Guarantee for small and medium industry loans to
the extent requested by the accredited institution covering a fixed
percentage of the loan amount outstanding but not exceeding 60% for
small industry loans or 40% for medium industry loans.
An individual small industry loan can be eligible for both types of guarantees.
16.       IGLF's guarantee fee will be equal to 2% per annum of the outstand-
ing amount of the guarantee. The fee on the Collateral Guarantee mentioned
in para. 14 (a) above may be passed on by the financial institution to the
end-user, but the fee on the Credit-risk Guarantee will be absorbed by
the institutions.
17.       IGLF will periodically monitor the quality of participating banks'
IGLF portfolio with a view to keeping arrearages as low as possible. To
this end, IGLF will provide assistance to the participating institutions with
regard to the appropriate handling of problem accounts. The participating
institutions will be allowed to levy a penalty charge of 5% per annum on
amounts in default.
18.       Participating institutions are obligated to repay IGLF irre-
spective of their own recoveries, but the Central Bank, as administrator of



-56-
ANNEX 2
Page 4
IGLF may allow deferment of payments in respect of projects in default
and/or in difficulty provided the institution submits to the Central Bank an
appropriate action plan; if within 45 days of original date of payment due
the Central Bank does not receive any specific action plan, the institution's
account with the Central Bank will be debited to the extent of amount due to
IGLF.
19.       The Central Bank will maintain IGLF's accounts, observing generally
accepted accounting principles and have them audited annually by qualified
and competent auditors.
