                                    INTRODUCTION
Education is universally recognized as one of the key determinants of socio-economic
security and welfare. The link between education and increased individual earnings has been
widely documented: there is a large body of cross-country evidence that education enhances
the employability, productivity and income earning capacity of individuals (Hanushek and
Welch, 2006). This in turn enables individuals to increase their household income and
welfare (Hanushek and Woesmann, 2008; Patrinos and Psacharopoulos, 2011). Education has
also been shown to have an impact on other socio-economic indicators such as child health.
Here again, the evidence from numerous countries shows a strong correlation between
mother’s education and child health outcomes (Currie and Moretti, 2003; Glewwe, 1999;
Desai and Alva, 1998; Behrman and Deolalikar, 1988). Better educated mothers are less
likely to have low birth weight babies and these babies are less likely to die within their first
year of life (Cutler and Muney, 2006). Moreover, more educated mothers are more likely to
have better health and nutrition levels, which lead to higher health and nutrition outcomes for
their children (Bicego and Boerma, 1993; Miller and Korenman, 1994; Duflo and Breierova,
2004; and Boyle et al., 2006).

Likewise, there is an increasing body of evidence to support the hypothesis that education is a
determinant of happiness, or subjective well-being. Reaching important personal goals can
often increase a person’s sense of self-worth and happiness, and resources such as education
and income are often necessary for the successful pursuit of goals. Hence it can be assumed
that people with fewer resources and opportunities are, on average, less successful in
reaching personal goals and are thus unhappier and less satisfied than people with more
resources and opportunities (Diener and Biswas-Diener, 2002; Diener and Fujita,1995). In a
study of the association between education and happiness in 35 mainly advanced but also
developing countries, Cheung and Chan (2009) found education to be a strong predictor of
life satisfaction, and that the longer the time spent on education, the higher were people’s
reported levels of satisfaction. Meanwhile, Tesch-Romer et al.’s (2008) study of the
relationship between gender inequality and subjective well-being across 57 countries found
that societal gender inequality was related to the size of gender differences in subjective well-
being, and that the inclusion of individual resources such as education and income in the
analysis reduced the size of gender and country differences.

The impact of educational attainment on these various socio-economic indicators has been
shown to vary by region, sub-region, gender, age, by income levels, and other variables. For
instance, the educational rate of return tends to be higher in developing countries vs.
developed countries. Investing in girl’s education tends to yield greater benefits than boys
education. The rate of return tends to decline with an increase in both the level of schooling
and a country’s per capita income. Moreover, most of the literature measures economic
returns to education in terms of the quantity of schooling rather than quality and more ore
recently; there has been an emphasis on the importance of adding educational quality to the
model. This increases the variation in returns to education from 25% to 73% (Hanuschek and
Woesmann, 2010). Recent literature also emphasizes that education may have less impact in
less developing countries that lack other facilitating factors (Hanuschek and Woesmann
                                               1
2010). Given this kind of variation, it is important to examine the impact of education on
socio-economic variables in various regional and cultural contexts.

In this paper, we focus on the socio-economic impact of educational attainment in
Afghanistan. Afghanistan presents a fairly unique context for examining the association
between education and the socio-economic variable discussed above. It is a conflict-affected
country, with strong and rich cultural and religious traditions. It also has some of the worst
developmental indicators and in the world. To date there is little empirical evidence of the
socio-economic economic impact of education in Afghanistan, although factors associated
with school enrollment have received some attention (Guimbert et al., 2008; Hunte, 2006;
Rashid, 2005; and Aturupane, Gunatilaka, Shojo and Ebenezer 2013). There are hardly any
studies that have looked specifically at the association between education and subjective
well-being in the context of a poor, conflict-affected country such as Afghanistan where
cultural norms and practices also impose considerable restrictions against women’s
education. It is this gap in knowledge that the present study aims to fill.

Using data from the National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA) survey of 2007/08,
we investigate the extent to which the educational attainment of men and women is
associated with greater economic welfare and less likelihood of being poor. The analysis is
divided into four parts: part one looks education and other factors associated with household
economic welfare and the probability of being poor; part two focuses on the education and
other factors associated with women’s participation in the labor force; part three looks at the
association of mother’s education with health-related outcomes of children; and part four
looks at the association between educational attainment of girls and women, and their
perceptions of well-being.

                                COUNTRY CONTEXT
Afghanistan’s education indicators are among the worst in the world and girls and rural
communities are particularly disadvantaged (Government of Afghanistan and International
Agencies, 2004; World Bank, 2012; and World Bank, 2013). Even in South Asia,
Afghanistan lags behind in education by a substantial margin as Table 1 indicates. And even
though a significant leap in enrollment took place immediately after the collapse of Taliban
rule in 2002 (Miwa, 2005), these positive developments have not been sustained (Aturupane,
Gunatilaka, Shojo and Ebenezer, 2013).

Historically politicization of education policy and ideological battles between successive
governments and political groups were partly responsible for marked inequalities in
educational attainment in Afghanistan up to about 2002 (World Bank, 2005). Years of
conflict also destroyed educational infrastructure and constrained access while the issue of
girls’ education has been a flashpoint for ideological controversy and even violence.
However, the Government of Afghanistan recognizes that girls need to be educated if
Afghanistan is to transform and develop.

       ANALYSIS OF FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH HOUSEHOLD
               ECONOMIC WELFARE AND POVERTY
The majority of Afghans are reported to view poverty as the main reason behind the ongoing
conflict (Oxfam, 2009). The most recent estimates of poverty in Afghanistan support this view.
While 36 per cent of Afghans are poor and only able to meet 78 per cent of the estimated cost of
basic consumption needs, at least half the population is consuming at a level less than 120 per
cent of the poverty line (World Bank, 2010). Thus, vulnerability is very high and one small
negative shock can plunge many individuals into poverty. In this section we look at the extent to
which the educational attainment of the household head and other factors are associated with
household economic welfare and the probability of the household being poor.

This analysis of household economic welfare defines economic welfare fairly narrowly as
denoted by the level of household per capita consumption. We look at economic welfare rather
than labor earnings, which is the usual approach to estimating returns associated with educational
attainment. This is because the wage data available in the NRVA 2007/08 is not uniform across
industries and occupations whereas the data on household consumption is comprehensive.

The welfare function we estimate is based on the relationships between consumption and
households’ resource endowments that have emerged from the theoretical and empirical
literature as follows:

       W  ?  ?X  ?                                                     (1)

In this equation, W denotes economic welfare as represented by the log of real per capita
household consumption and X is a vector of exogenous endowments that determine household
expenditure, and ? is a stochastic error term. The exogenous endowments are grouped into five
categories: The demographic characteristics of the household head; his or her level of
educational attainment; characteristics of the household; community and infrastructure variables,
and regional variables.

The analysis of the probability of being poor fits the following model,

       Pr( P  1| X )  F (?  ? X )                                       (2)

where the binary dependent outcome P takes the value one if the household is poor, and zero if it
is not. F ( z )  e /(1  e ) is the cumulative logistic distribution and the parameters ? are
                   Z       Z


estimated by maximum likelihood. X is the same vector of five categories of exogenous
endowments used in the estimation of household economic welfare.

Neither model addresses the issue of causality to distinguish whether household per capita
consumption or a household being in poverty is a cause or a consequence of various resource
endowments available to the household. Instead, it only seeks to identify the variables associated
with household economic welfare and the probability of being poor.


                                                4
The dependent variable in the analysis of household economic welfare is per capita household
consumption expenditure which has been adjusted for spatial and temporal differences. This is
exactly the same data used for the World Bank’s (2010) Poverty Status in Afghanistan, and
details about how the data was adjusted can be found in that report. Data identifying a household
as being poor is also derived from the same study (World Bank, 2010), which used the Cost of
Basic Needs (CBN) method (Ravallion, 1998) to estimate the poverty threshold. Thus the
poverty line used in this analysis represents the level of per capita consumption at which the
members of a household can be expected to meet their basic needs (food and non-food).

We turn next to the explanatory variables included in the five categories of endogenous
endowments. Among the characteristics of the household head included such as age, gender and
marital status are two variables denoting two levels of disability, mild and severe. Six levels of
educational attainment are included, ranging from primary education to university, with no
schooling being the reference category. Among the household variables are dependency ratio of
the household and four sources of the largest share of household income: market farming, farm
wage, trade and transport and transfers, with non-farm wage being the reference category. These
factors were included as the World Bank (2010) found income generating activities to be closely
linked to per capita consumption expenditure and poverty in Afghanistan.

Terrain characteristics were also included as explanatory variables as they were found to be
highly correlated with poverty in Afghanistan (World Bank, 2010), particularly in the
estimations based on the rural sub-sample. We also controlled for accessibility and connectivity
by including variables on the distance to the nearest road, and a dummy variable to indicate
whether the road was passable all year. Since the World Bank’s (2010) study suggested that the
level of economic development of the community as denoted by the proportion of bad jobs
(casual laborer, self-employment and family work) and the share of underemployed (working
less than 35 hours a week) among the employed were important correlates of poverty, we
included these variables in the models to see their impact on per capita household consumption
and the probability of being poor. Finally, we included province dummies to capture the effect of
regional fixed effects not captured by the other spatial variables.

Women’s Labor Force Participation

The female labor force participation rate in Afghanistan in 2007/08 was considerably higher than
in many of the country’s South Asian neighbors. In Afghanistan, 47 per cent of women between
the ages of 16 and 60 participated in the labor market in 2007/08 (based on NRVA 2007/08 data)
whereas the equivalent rate for Sri Lanka was 37 per cent, India 32 per cent, and Pakistan 21 per
cent. Participation rates in Bangladesh and Nepal tended to be higher at around 57 and 80 per
cent (ILO data from KLIMnet). In rural Afghanistan, 54 per cent of working age women
participates in the labor force whereas in urban areas this figure drops below the regional average
to 31 per cent.

In this section we look at the factors associated with the probability of female labor force
participation in Afghanistan, in particular, the impact of educational attainment on women’s
labor force participation decisions. In addition to the explanatory variables included in the
previous analyses on the factors associated with economic welfare, we controlled for cultural

                                                5
factors by introducing two dummy variables denoting whether the individual was usually
accompanied when she left the family compound, and whether she usually wears a burka outside
the home.

Education and Child Health Outcomes

Afghanistan has some of the lowest health indicators in the world and in the region. It has the
highest maternal mortality rate (1400 in 2008), second lowest life expectancy (48 years in 2010),
and the 11th highest under-five mortality rate (149 deaths) in the world (UNICEF, 2012). In the
region, the country had the highest incidence of stunting at 59 per cent, which is higher than the
South Asian average of 47 with Nepal and India in close pursuit at 49 and 48 per cent. And it
also fared the worst in child immunization indicators. Only 68 per cent of children had been
immunized against tuberculosis, and 66 per cent against polio, whereas in South Asia, the
averages for 2010 were 88 and 75 per cent, with India faring the next worse at 87 per cent and 70
per cent, respectively (UNICEF, 2012).

The root causes of Afghanistan’s alarming health indicators appear to be poverty, conflict, and
slow economic and social progress (World Bank, 2005). Low access of girls to education must
also play a role, as participation in education is known to delay marriage until the age at which
the female body is sufficiently developed for child-bearing. In this part of the analysis we looked
at the extent to which the probability of a child being given colostrum and being immunized
(both indicators of child health) is associated with her mother’s education level. Accordingly, our
analysis was based on modeling four equations related to four child health outcomes: the
probability of a child being given colostrum; being immunized for tuberculosis by being given
the BCG vaccine; for diphtheria whooping cough and tetanus with the DPT vaccine, and for
polio with the polio vaccine. We included several other variables in addition to many of the
variables included in the analyses in preceding sections, these included variables denoting birth
order and mother’s age, to investigate whether a male child is more likely to be given colostrum
and whether having an older and more experienced mother is likely to be important. We have
also looked at the impact of decision-making within the household on child health outcomes by
examining whether, the principal female member of the household having decision-making
control over what needs to be spent on children’s health, is associated with better child health
outcomes.

To understand supply-side factors, we included those variables which represent the availability
of health facilities in the community, including the availability of health personnel of both sexes.
The response options to the questions of the time taken to walk to the nearest health facility were
taken to represent the distance in terms of travel time by foot to four types of health facilities:
health post, public clinic, government hospital, and pharmacy, and since the lowest response rate
for the health facilities variables was 70 per cent, we were able to include these critical variables
without compromising too much on sample size.

Education and the Subjective Well-Being of Girls and Women

While the notion of utility or units of happiness is central to welfare economics, it is only
recently that economists have accepted people’s own perceptions of their happiness as a good

                                                 6
measure on which to base quantitative research. Following this shift in economists’ own
perceptions, the empirical literature on subjective well-being has expanded rapidly. Fortunately,
the NRVA data of 2007/08 allows us to explore the subjective well-being of girls because the
survey schedule administered to all girls and women 10 years and older included a question on
perceived happiness which was amenable to analysis. The question was phrased as follows: ‘If
you were asked to rate how content you are with your life, how would you rate it?’ There were
five ranked answers: ‘very unhappy’; ‘unhappy’; ‘neither unhappy nor happy’;‘happy’; and,
‘very happy’. Converting these answers into happiness scores (1,2,3,4 and 5), we estimated
happiness functions using ordinary least squares with the happiness score as the dependent
variable, and individual, household, community and regional variables which can plausibly be
hypothesized to influence happiness as the explanatory variables. Unfortunately, the survey did
not administer the same question to males, so we are only able to look at the association between
education and the subjective well-being of females. We turn next to the results of the estimation
of happiness functions for Afghan women older than 18 years of age. In these models, the
association of education with happiness levels were explored in greater detail, with dummy
variables included for the level of educational attainment, the reference category being no
schooling.

                                 EMPIRICAL RESULTS

The results of Part 1 of our analysis are laid out in Tables 2 and 3 below. Table 2 lays out the
results of the OLS estimation of factors associated with log of per capita household consumption.
Separate equations were estimated for the urban and rural sub-samples. Figures 1 and 2 present
our findings on the impact of various levels of education on household consumption for urban
and rural populations. The model estimating factors associated with log of per capita household
consumption in urban households fits well, explaining 45 per cent of the variation of the
dependent variable. The equation relating to the much larger rural sub-sample fits less well,
explaining only 15 per cent of the variation in household consumption.

In contrast, the proportion of bad jobs in the community, and the proportion of under-employed
persons in the community have as significant, almost as large, negative association with
household consumption as the higher levels of education. Again the impacts appear to be larger
in urban areas. The limits that the environment imposes on per capita consumption are also
evident from the large, significant coefficients on the regional dummies. Other than for the south
west, household per capita consumption in all other provinces is significantly lower than
consumption in the central region. The differentials, though, appear more marked for urban areas
than for rural areas. For example, while per capita consumption is 40 per cent less in the urban
south than in urban areas in central province, in rural areas, the differential between the two
provinces is only 8 per cent.

Empirical Findings: Part One

The education variables emerge as the most important in explaining the variation in household
consumption. Only the variables related to the level of economic development in the community
come close. There are several important points to note about the education variables. First, they
are all highly significant. Second, the impact of educational attainment on per capita
consumption increases monotonically with the level of education with secondary education in
rural areas being the only exception. Third, returns to education in urban areas are consistently
higher than in rural areas. So, for example, if an urban household head is educated to the primary
level, then household per capita consumption will be 7 per cent more than if he or she did not
have any schooling, all other things being equal. In rural areas, the return would be marginally
less. From that level of education onwards, the differential in returns generally increases. Thus, a
household head with a university degree in urban areas is associated with a level of household


                                                     10
consumption that is almost 50 per cent more than one with no schooling, whereas in rural areas,
the returns are 30 per cent more.

Relatedly, the household’s main source of income being non-farm wages makes for lower per
capita consumption in rural areas than income from other sources, whereas the converse is true
of urban areas. Main income from trade and transport, in particular, appear to be associated with
higher per capita household consumption than in rural areas. The dependency ratio has a
predictably large negative impact on household per capita consumption, with little difference in
impact between urban and rural areas. But the size of the coefficient is as large as that of the
proportion of bad-jobs in the community in urban areas, but in rural areas, a higher dependency
ratio is more strongly associated with lower levels of consumption than is the proportion of bad
jobs in the community.

By and large, other than for age, the demographic characteristics of the household head appear
not to be very important: household per capita expenditure decreases with the age of the
household head, and this is probably because Afghanistan’s labor market is skewed heavily
towards younger people, and the level of economic activity is such that physical strength rather
than experience is better rewarded.

Empirical Findings: Part Two

We turn next to the results of the analysis of the factors associated with the probability of being
poor set out in Table 3. The urban model passes the goodness of fit test, but the rural model does
not, suggesting that the explanatory variables in the equation for the rural sample fail to
adequately explain the factors associated with poverty in rural areas. Nevertheless, the education
variables in both equations perform well, although their impact is not as large as in the model
explaining variations household consumption. As the education level of the head of the
household increases, the likelihood that the household will be poor decreases monotonically for
both the urban and rural samples, but here again, the impact appears greater in urban areas than
in rural areas.

The other variables impact on reducing or increasing the chances of being poor in much the same
way they increase of decrease household per capita consumption. To be noted, in particular, is
the impact of economic environment as represented by the proportion of bad jobs and under-
employed in the community, and the regional dummies. A higher dependency ratio is
significantly associated with poverty, and the older the household head, the more likely the
household is poor.

Part 2 of our analysis focused the impact of educational attainment on women’s labor force
participation decision. To do this we introduced two dummy variables in additional those in our
base model, denoting whether a women is usually accompanied when she left the family
compound, and whether she wears a burka outside her home. The results of the logistic
regression for the rural and urban sub-samples are set out in Table 4. Admittedly, the models do
not explain variations in the dependent variable very well as neither passes the goodness-of-fit
test. Nevertheless, while the equations may not explain the factors associated with the probability
of women’s labor force participation satisfactorily, we can still see the extent to which education
and some other variables of interest are associated with the probability of participation.

The estimates in the table show that educational attainment is strongly, significantly and
monotonically associated with the probability of labor force participation only in urban areas and
that, too, for education levels including and beyond high school. In fact, in urban areas, they
appear to have the strongest association with the dependent variable from all the factors included
in the model other than for the dependency ratio which dominates. In contrast, the results
associated with the education variables are by and large not significant in rural areas.

The higher the dependency ratio and the higher per capita household consumption, the less likely
the woman participates, but having children less than 10 years of age appears to increase the
likelihood that she goes to work. Thus while greater care responsibilities keep women at home,
higher per capita household consumption levels may mean that women can afford to make a
choice. But having small children may require more income, while the presence of other adults
in the household may enable women to leave small children in their care and go out to work.
Older women are more likely to participate in the labor market, but marriage reduces the
likelihood of participation. Likewise, coming from a traditional cultural background appears to
reduce the likelihood of women going out to work. Thus, having to be accompanied when
leaving the compound, and having to wear a burka when doing so appear to constrain women
from engaging in market work.

 Women in households that are dependent on agricultural income and transfers, particularly in the
 rural sector, are more likely to work. But living in remote hilly areas and further away from
 roads appear to work against women engaging in the labor market. Low levels of economic
 development in the community as denoted by the proportion of bad jobs and share of
 underemployed also appear to compel women to go out to work, and regional variables are also
 significant. But only in the west and southwest are women more likely to go to work than women
 in the central regions.

 Empirical Findings: Part Three

 The results of the part 3 of our analysis regarding the impact of education non child health
 related outcomes are laid out in Table A.1 in the appendix. Although only the model on the
 probability of being given colostrum passes the goodness of fit test, the results suggest strong
 associations between several of the explanatory variables included in the models and child health
 outcomes of interest.

 First looking at demand-side factors, it is apparent that the probability of positive outcomes
 increases with the mother’s years of schooling, although the marginal effects are significant only
 in the immunization for tuberculosis and diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus. Older mothers
 are less likely to immunize their children and if mothers have to be accompanied outside the
 family compound, then their children are also less likely to be immunized. On the other hand,
 wearing a burka is associated with a greater probability of immunization. However, the largest
 positive association between demand-side factors and child health outcomes is for the decision-
 making variable and the per capita household consumption variable. Per capita household
 expenditure is positively correlated with child health outcomes, significantly in the case of BCG
 and DPT vaccination, and the size of the marginal effects are as large as the effects on the
 variable denoting household decision-making.

 We turn next to the health facilities variables. By and large, the greater the distance the health
 facility is from the community, the less likely that the infant is given colostrum and the child is
 immunized, but the marginal effects are significant only in the case of health post and public
 clinic. The availability of female healthcare personnel at the facilities is associated with a greater
 likelihood of immunization. The presence of a female health worker at the health post and the

                                                                  15
midwife at the public clinic seem particularly important. While several of the terrain and
infrastructure access variables and almost all the regional variables appear to be significantly
associated with child immunization outcomes, there is no distinct pattern as the importance of
these variables seems to vary with the different outcomes. This is hard to explain.

Empirical Findings: Part Four

The results of the final part of our analysis are laid out in Table 5, which shows the results of the
estimation of happiness functions for the sub-samples of girls between 10 and 18 years of age in
urban and rural areas. Table 6 sets out the equivalent results for the estimation of factors
associated with the subjective well-being of women 19 years and older. The first point to note in
the tables is that the models do not have much explanatory power. For example, the explanatory
variables in the urban model explaining girls’ happiness account for only 19 per cent of the
variation in reported happiness levels and this is the best fit of all four equations. Nevertheless,
many of the associations between happiness and the explanatory variables included in the models
are informative, significant and worthy of comment.

Consider the results relating to girls between 10-18 years of age, enrollment in school is strongly
and significantly associated with greater happiness. In urban areas, going to school increases
girls’ happiness score by 18 per cent, and in rural areas, it increases the score by 13 per cent, all
else being equal. In contrast, being severely disabled, having been employed the previous week,
and having to do household chores, reduces happiness. Nevertheless, being accompanied when
leaving the compound makes girls happy, but having to wear a burka does not.

All the coefficients on the educational attainment variables bar one are positive, large and
significant, and in urban areas, they increase monotonically with the level of education. So
having primary education increases the happiness score by 16 per cent in urban areas compared
with having no schooling at all. But continuing in education up to university increases the
happiness score by 21 per cent. In rural areas, the returns to education in terms of happiness
increase far more steeply. Those with primary education are 9 per cent happier than those with
no education, but university education increases the happiness score by nearly 50 per cent.

Happiness increases with household consumption, but employment appears to have no effect on
happiness levels. Violence or insecurity-related shocks significantly reduce happiness in rural
areas, but experiencing other shocks is negatively and significantly associated with happiness in
both sectors. In fact, in rural areas, other shocks appear to cause greater unhappiness than
experience of violence or insecurity related shocks. Rural girls appear to be happy to wear the
burka as they become older but they continue to prefer participation and consultation in the
process of making decisions about girls’ education. Women living in valleys and hills seem to be
happier than those living in plains and greater connectivity is also important for rural women’s
happiness. However, living near a road which is passable all year reduces urban women’s
happiness and this may be due to this variable picking up the discomfort associated with living
near a busy highway. All else being equal, living in urban areas in the southwest and west central
regions is associated with lower happiness than living in all other provinces, but only rural
women living in the western and eastern Provinces are significantly happier than women living
in the rural areas of central province.

Empirical Findings: Part Five

To sum up, our findings indicate that educational attainment of the household head is one of the
most important predictors of economic welfare as measured by per capita household
consumption and of the probability of being poor. The economic opportunities afforded by the
environment in which households find themselves, and internal characteristics such as the
number of dependents relative to the number of working members, and the age of the head of
household, are also important.

Our findings on the impact of educational attainment on women’s decisions to participate in the
labor force in Afghanistan maybe summed by as follows: greater educational attainment is
significantly associated with a greater likelihood of women participating in the labor force only
in urban areas. But by and large, it is economic factors such as low household income and living
in economically backward areas that compel women to go out to work. Only the better off can
afford to stay at home while those with too many domestic care responsibilities and those bound
by cultural traditions are compelled to do so.

The findings in regards to the impact of education on child health outcomes ARE reassuring.
They suggest that the more educated the mother is, the more likely that her child is immunized.
The household’s level of economic welfare and the decision-making power of its principal
female member appear to be critical, with the availability of female health personnel and
distance to health facilities also playing a part.

Finally, in regards to the impact of educational attainment on the happiness of girls and women
our findings confirm what has been shown in other countries: that happiness increases with per
capita expenditure, confirming that poverty makes for greater unhappiness. We found that being
enrolled in school increased happiness, and the more educated women were, the happier they
reported themselves as being. Consultative decision-making in the household about education
was associated with greater happiness and having better-educated parents also increased
happiness. Other things being equal, greater household income was associated with greater
happiness levels, violence and other shocks tended to reduce happiness particularly in rural
areas, and there appear to be large and significant regional effects on happiness levels not
accounted for by the other spatial variables.

                                                   CONCLUSION
This study investigated socio-economic outcomes associated with education in Afghanistan.
Among the outcomes considered were, household economic welfare and the probability of being
poor; women’s labor force participation; the likelihood of infants being given colostrum and
being immunized; and, girls’ and women’s own perceptions of well-being.

The econometric analysis revealed strong and significant relationships between educational
attainment and all these socio-economic outcomes. For example, the educational attainment of
the household head appears to be one of the most important predictors of economic welfare as
measured by per capita household consumption and of the probability of being poor. The
economic opportunities afforded by the environment in which households find themselves, and
internal characteristics such as the number of dependents relative to the number of working
members, and the age of the head of household, are also important.

Greater educational attainment was also found to be significantly associated with a greater
likelihood of women participating in the labor force in urban areas. Nevertheless, it appears that
economic factors such as low household income and living in economically backward areas are
more compelling forces that propel women to go out to work. Only the better off can afford to
stay at home while those with too many domestic care responsibilities and those bound by
cultural traditions appear to have little other choice.

Educational attainment of the mother was also found to be a key predictor of whether her child is
immunized. Here, too, the household’s level of economic welfare and the decision-making
power of its principal female member appear to be critical, with the availability of female health
personnel and distance to health facilities also playing a part.


                                                              20
Being enrolled in school increased girls’ happiness, and the more educated women were, the
happier they reported themselves as being. Consultative decision-making in the household about
education was also associated with greater happiness and having better-educated parents also
increased happiness. Other things being equal, greater household income was associated with
greater happiness levels, violence and other shocks tended to reduce happiness particularly in
rural areas. There also appear to be strong regional effects on the socio-economic outcomes
examined in this paper.

The findings of this study provide very strong empirical support for the Government of
Afghanistan’s declared policy goals to invest in education, particularly of women, to transform
and develop the country. And since education influences many other variables found to be
associated with these outcomes, such as the availability of female health workers on child health
outcomes, enhancing educational attainment will be absolutely essential for the socio-economic
progress of Afghanistan’s people.

Notes:
1. Dependent variables are: the probability of being given colostrum, mean 0.86, standard deviation 0.007; the probability of receiving BCG vaccination, mean 0.62, standard deviation
0.006; the probability of receiving Polio vaccination; mean 0.76, standard deviation 0.006; the probability of receiving DPT vaccination; mean 0.49, standard deviation 0.007.
2. Sample includes children 3 years or less for the model of factors associated with the probability of being given colostrum while the immunization equations relate to the sample of children
5 years or less.
3. The variables denoting the time taken by foot to various health facilities have been cardinalized from the response options as follows: 1 – no time at all, in community itself; 2 – one hour
or less; 3 – more than one hour, less than three; 4 – more than 3 hours, less than 6 hours; 5 – more than 6 hours, less than 12 hours; more than 12 hours.
4. The omitted categories in the dummy variable analyses are: urban; plain; Central.
5. The F-adjusted mean residual test measures goodness of fit after fitting a logistic regression model to survey data. Archer and Lemeshow’s user-written Stata program svylogitgof.ado was
used to generate the test results. See Archer and Lemeshow (2006), ‘Goodness-of-fit test for a logistic regression model fitted using sample survey data’, in Stata Journal, 6 (1), pp. 97-105.
6. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the one per cent, five per cent and ten per cent levels respectively.
7. Estimated using NRVA 2007/08 data, individual weights used.
