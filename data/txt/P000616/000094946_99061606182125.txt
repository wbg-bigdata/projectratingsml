SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
CREDIT 2203-DJI
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) of the Second Urban Development Project of
Djibouti, for which Credit 2203-DJI, in the amount of SDR 7.8 million (US $ 11.2 million equivalent), was
approved on January 15, 1991, signed on March 29, 1991 and declared effective on September 27, 1991.
The Credit 2203-DJI was closed on June 30, 1998, the original closing date. The final disbursement of
SDR 19,137 took place on October 5, 1998 and an amount of SDR 6,465 was cancelled. Co-financing for the
project was provided by the European Union (grant of US $9 million), the Caisse Centrale de D&veloppement
Economique (French grant of US $12 million), and the Ministry of Cooperation and Development (French grant
of $6 million).
This ICR was prepared by Gerard Tenaille, James Wright, and Tejbir Singh Phool, Consultants,
reviewed by Jeffrey S.Racki, Sector Manager (AFTUI) and Michael Sarnis, Country Director for Djibouti.
Preparation of the ICR was begun during a completion mission to Djibouti in June 1998, of which the
aide-memoire is attached. The ICR is based on project files, correspondence, the Staff Appraisal Report and the
Developmert Credit Agreement. The borrower andcofinanciers were invited to review and comment on the
ICR. Comments were received from the borrower and the French Development Agency (AFD) and are annexed
unedited to the ICR.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF D1IBOUTI
SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT: CREDIT 2203-DJI
EVALUATION SUMMARY
i.    Introduction Much of Djibouti's existence is due to its strategic location at the entrance to the Red
Sea. French involvement in the region began in 1859 and continues today in the form of a large military
presence and direct budget support. In 1985 about two-thirds of the country's population of approximately
425,000 lived in the city of Djibouti. In that year the first IDA-assisted urban project was initiated to help the
Government: (i) increase the capacity of urban institutions; (ii) improve the living conditions of the urban poor;
and (iii) improve cost recovery practices. The Project Completion Report recorded several delays in
implementation but assessed that the project achieved most of its goals. An important lesson of this project was
that financial and institutional anrangements took longer than expected owing to Government reluctance to
enforce the collection of annual plot fees. The Second Urban Development Project (SUDP) was appraised in
1990, two years before the first project was completed. In the 1990s, during the implementation of the SUDP,
the country suffered from a civil war and severe economic decline, which had a profound effect on the project.
ii.    Objectives. The SUDP's objectives were to: strengthen the Govermment's policy-making
framework; help make the urban setting more efficient and more attractive; increase the absorptive
capacity of key institutions responsible for urban management; improve the urban environment and living
conditions in Djibouti; improve the land tenure system and clarify the legislation governing public
property and land ownership; enhance cost recovery practices; and review the extent to which
decentralization may be beneficial.
iii.    Components. The project's components included works to provide residential plots, improved
roads, water supply, street lighting, off site drainage, street signs, and electricity to three different parts of
the city. The project further provided technical assistance, equipment, and training to seven different
sector agencies. It also provided for studies to help improve the functioning of government agenciesThe
project cost was estimated to be approximately US $45 million equivalent. Works components accounted for
approximately 61% and the institutional support component accounted for the rest. IDA agreed to a credit of US
$11 million equivalent or 25 percent of the total cost. There were three co-financiers.
iv.    Evaluation of Objectives.  The many and varied objectives established a complex project which
would have required effective coordination among the seven agencies and several ministries of government. A
large part of the credit was earmarked for the recruitment of expatriate staff which, to achieve a development
impact, would have required a systematic transfer of know-how. The designs for the physical components were
generally satisfactory but the design of institutional support was poor.
v.     Results. Physical works financed by French grants were completed with cost overruns but generally
satisfactorily. These helped make significant improvements in several neighborhoods. Several works financed
by the IDA Credit were completed late and others are only partially finished. A major drainage contract
experienced cost overruns and could not be finished with available funding. The canal is now abandoned in an
unusable and hazardous state. The large technical assistance plan did not have the desired impact and the
project has significantly under-achieved its institutional objectives. Conditions for establishing a housing
finance system were not met and the financial structure collapsed. After two urban projects and 13 years of
institutional strengthening efforts, two key sector institutions are virtually bankrupt. Only four of seven studies
were satisfactorily carried out and yielded limited benefits. The economic rate of return is assumed to be below
10%.



vi.    Implementation Experience. The project was adversely affected by significant events that could
not be anticipated at the time of preparation.  The civil war, which erupted in November 1991, two
months after Credit effectiveness, delayed the project, diverted budget resources and jeopardized the
Government's financial situation so that it was unable to meet its counterpart requirements. This
especially impacted the completion of the storm drainage component in Old Ward 7. In addition to delays
caused by the civil war, implementation also started slowly because design studies and bidding documents were
only partially prepared during project preparation. The OPEC loan was never made available due to
Djibouti's default on loan repayments to OPEC. From the onset of the SUDP it was becoming apparent
from experience with the first project that the demand for residential plots had been overestimated. The
cost recovery system in the first project was also breaking down. These problems continued during the
SUDP. In two sites, residents did not accept resettlement and the project scope was reduced. Technical
assistance for routine maintenance of community infrastructure was not available as planned.
vii.    Bank and Borrower Performance. On IDA's part, during preparation, the complexity of the project,
involving a large number of components and agencies, in a country with limited financial resources and
capacity, was not taken sufficiently into account. More seriously, in spite of the very serious deterioration of the
broader context and many project-specific problems, there was no mid-term review or restructuring of the
project. On the Borrower's part, cost recovery measures were inadequate and much of the technical assistance
was applied ineffectively. More seriously, although the BPU knew that there were not enough funds, it
launched the works in Old Ward 7 without developing a contingency plan in case of a shortfall from identified
sources.
viii.   Project Outcome. The project has achieved few of the objectives intended at appraisal, and its result is
considered unsatisfactory. Significant portions of the physical components are still incomplete and very limited
institutional improvements are evident.
ix.    Key Lessons.
The following key lessons were learned:
* Especially in countries with limited capacity, projects should focus on a limited set of objectives that are
within the Government's ability to manage, and objectives should focus on fundamental issues. The number
of agencies and government ministries to be involved should be carefully considered.
* Where a follow-on project is prepared, it would be preferable to appraise the project after the lessons
from the first operation are evident.
* Projects affected by severe changes in the broader context, such as civil war or serious economic decline,
should be reassessed. The original objectives or complexity of the project may no longer be feasible.
Restructuring, cancellation of some components, or curtaihment of the entire project may be required. Mid-
term reviews are essential in these cases. Each component should be scrutinized to see if it is still sensible
within the changed context and whether sufficient financial and supervision resources are available.
* In cases where counterpart funding problems are likely to develop, it would be preferable for donors to
finance distinct components. Parallel financing would put individual components at less risk than under co-
financing.
* Continuity of IDA staff and good record keeping are necessary to successfully supervise a project:
Reorganization at IDA and several changes of responsible staff undoubtedly had a negative influence on the
quality of project ownership, on monitoring of key issues such as credit effectiveness, and on supervision.

Sector               hfiastructure
Sub-Sector:          Urban Development
B.  BACKGROUND
1.    Djibouti owes much of its existence to its location at the entrance to the Red Sea. French involvement
in the Region began in 1859 and continued with the establishment ofthe port of Djiboutiville in 1892 to provide
facilities for French ships in transit to Asia. Djibouti gained independence in 1977, but the French continue to
play a large role, with a large military presence and substantial foreign assistance, including high levels of direct
budget support.
2.     Djibouti acts as a regional service center for the Hom of Africa, providing port, transport and banking
services to Ethiopia and Somalia. Services account for about 75% of Djibouti's GDP. The country has very
limited mineral deposits, energy resources, or agricultumal potential. Its principal assets are its strategic location,
natural harbor with associated infrastructure, and good fishing waters. In 1985 about two-thirds of the country's
population of approximately 425,000 lived inthe city of Djibouti.
3.     The two major ethnic groups in the country are the Issas, who are of Somalian ancestry, and the Afars,
who are ethnically linked to Ethiopia. Tensions between the two groups emerged around 1990 and erupted into
armed conflict. A peace accord was not signed until December 1994. These and the following years were
marked by low or declining economic growth, rapid population growth, including immigration from
neighboring countries, and a significant lowering of living standards for most of the population. The country
faces long-term problems of widespread poverty and unemployment, deteriorating social services and
crumbling infrastructure. These are compounded by an acute financial crisis and by the scheduled reduction in
France's military presence.
4.    In 1985, IDA initiated an Urban Development Project (UDP, Credit 1518-DJI), co-financed by USAID.
The project aimed to help the Government to: (i) increase the capacity of urban institutions; (ii) improve the
living conditions of the urban poor; and (iii) improve cost recovery practices. The Project Completion Report
for the UDP, dated September 8, 1993, recorded several delays in implementation but concluded that the project
had achieved most of its social and institutional goals. The report noted satisfactory completion of most works
components and some improvements in cost recovery and institutional capacity. However, it also noted that
cost recovery from land transfers and annual residential plot fees fell short of expectations, placing the
sustainability of infrascture investments in jeopardy. An important lesson of this project was, therefore, that



financial and institutional arrangements took longer than expected due in part to Govermment's reluctance to
implement cost recovery measures.
5.    At the Government's request, an identification mission for the Second Urban Development Project
(SUDP) took place in December 1988, more than two years before the scheduled credit closing date of the UDP
and approximately four years before the project was actually completed.
C.    STATEMENT AND EVALUATION OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
6.     The objectives of the Second Urban Development Project, as described in the Staff Appraisal Report
9037-DJI, of December 11, 1990, were to:
(a) strengthen the policy-making framework and the coordination and planning capabilities of the
Government in the urban sector for efficient management of urban investments;
(b) help make the urban setting more efficient and more attractive, enhancing Djibouti's role as a regional
center for services, finance and transit;
(c) increase the absorptive capacity of key institutions responsible for urban management,
(d) improve the urban environment and living conditions in Djibouti;
(e) improve the land tenure system and clarify the legislation governing public property and land
ownership;
(f)  enhance cost recovery practices, the revenue base of urban sector agencies, and study the prospects for a
sustainable and non-distortionary housing finance scheme; and
(g) review the extent to which decentralization may be beneficial in Djibouti.
7.     The project components included the following:
(i)  Old Wards. Protection from flooding in low lying areas and improved access to densely populated and
low-income settlements by contributing improved roads, water supply, and public lighting. These
actions were focused on Wards 1, 2, and 7 (64 ha., 34,000 inhabitants). In addition, the project would
provide off-site drainage in Old Wards 1 to 6, and preparation of final designs for Old Wards 7Ois,
Djebel and Ambouli;
(ii) Balbala Inproved lighting conditions in Balbala and planning of future extensions to respond to the
increasing demand for serviced plots. The project would include development of 3,600 plots, staking
out and clearing of primary roads and drainage on future extensions, and installation of street names,
plot numbers and traffic signs in the built-up areas, and construction of roads and drainage in the old
center;
(iii) Salines Ouest. Development of 228 plots, including streets, drainage, water supply, sewerage,
electricity and street lighting networks;
(iv) Institutional Support. Continuation of earlier assistance to: (a) the Ministry of Public Works, Urban
Development and Housing (MTPUL); (b) the Land Office (LO); (c) the "Societe Inmobili6re de
Djibouti" (SID); (d) the District of Djibouti (DD); (e) financial authorities; (f) the "Caisse de
Developpement de Djibouti" (CDD); and (g) the Project Management Unit (BPU).
8.     Conditions for effectiveness were: (1) recording legal title in the name of the State for the 3,600 plots
in Balbala, (ii) simplification of the procedure for issuing building pernits in the old wards and Balbala; (iii)
establishing new selling prices for the sale of plots in the old wards and Balbala, (iv) modifying the structure of
2



water tariffs; (v) taking steps toward a new code to facilitate the transfer of land and the use of land titles as
security for loans; (vi) appointment of a director and a deputy director for the project unit; and (vii) effectiveness
of cofinanciers' loans and grants.
9.     Project Cost and Financing  The total project cost was estimated to be approximately US $45
million. Civil works in the Old Wards, Balbala, and Salines Ouest accounted for approximately 61% (or 39%,
19%, and 3% respectively) of the base cost of US $37 million. Approximately 39% of the base cost comprised
the institutional support component: studies less than 5%/o, training 10%, technical assistance over 40%/o, and
equipment & staffing also over 40% of this component's financial resources. IDA agreed to a credit of US $11
million equivalent or 25 percent of the cost. Of this amount, US $3 million were devoted to the old wards and
US $8 million to institutional support and project preparation. Less than US $0.2 million were directed to the
Balbala component and IDA made no financial commitment towards the Salines Ouest component. The OPEC
Fund agreed to provide a loan for US $2 million or 4% of the total cost. The Borrower agreed to provide US $7
million or 16% of the total cost. The remaining US $25 million or 55% were grants (US $9 million from the
EU, US $12 million from the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique, and US $6 million from the French
Ministry of Cooperation and Development).
10.    Evaluation of Objectives While the physical objectives were appropriate, the institutional objectives
were too many and too unfocused for a country with limited capacity. The project had several different types of
objectives. Improving Djibouti's role as a regional service center and improving the urban environment and
living conditions were the most fundamental objectives. Other stated objectives such as improving policy
making in Government and improving institutional capacity, land tenure, cost recovery, and housing finance,
were means of achieving and sustaining the more fundamental objectives. In an effort to meet these diverse
objectives, seven different organizations and several ministries of government were involved which would have
required very effective inter-agency coordination. A large portion of the credit was used to finance the purchase
of equipment and to recruit expatriate staff, which, to have a development impact, would have required a plan to
systematically transfer know-how before the expatriates departed. The objective of achieving a workable
housing finance system may not have been practical in the absence of a well functioning financial system. The
evaluation of decentralization would appear to have been of limited value in a city-state with limited resources
and large immediate needs.
D.    ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
11.    Overall Assessment. Works financed by the EU and French grants were largely completed by
December 1998, late and with cost over-runs, but generally satisfactorily. These contributed to some
improvement to the urban setting. Some works financed by the IDA credit and the OPEC loan were completed
late and others were only partly finished. Preconditions for establishing a housing finance system were barely
met as the financial structure collapsed during implementation. The project significantly under-achieved its
institutional development objectives.
12.   Works in the Old Wards. The EU grant financed works in Wards 1 through 6 and in Avenue 13
which started 3-5 years late but were completed satisfactorily (see Table 5). The number of beneficiaries was
reduced by 4,000, and the cost of the works was slightly greater than the appraised cost (see Table 8). Most
IDA financed roads and street lighting were completed late though otherwise satisfactorily. However,
some tertiary roads and drainage works in the old wards were not completed because residents resisted the
amount of demolition and resettlement that would have been required. There was a major problem
involving a large storm drain in Old Ward 7 which was to be financed by the IDA Credit and an OPEC
loan. The contract was awarded near the end of the project period. Before project completion, works were
suspended because Government counterpart funds and the OPEC loan were not available (Djibouti had
3



defaulted on repayments to OPEC), because of cost overruns (especially unforeseen costs of moving
utilities) and because additional works (drain covers) were added to the contract without assuring
additional funding. The contractor halted the works in September 1997 when arrears reached US $2.4
million. To help resolve the problem, CFD contributed US $0.7 million (DF 138 million) and IDA
reallocated unutilized funds from the credit to pay the contractor. This paid only a part of the arrears. The
canal is now abandoned in an unusable and environmentally hazardous state. Nine sections are
constructed separately and there is no flow between them. These incomplete works have exceeded costs
including price and physical contingencies by about 7%. In order to complete the work and link various
sections, an additional investment of about US $4.5 million is required. This investment would result in a
total component cost of approximately US $10-11 million compared to the initial estimate of US $6
million.
13.    Works in Balbala  CFD and MCD grant-financed roads, drainage, water supply, and public lighting
also stauted 3-4 years late but were completed generally satisfactorily. The target of 3,600 plots was reduced to
3,200 plots because of resettlement problems. IDA financed street and drainage works in the old center were
stopped to avoid displacing local populations. The beneficiaries of the SUDP rejected the resettlement plan
developed under the UDP.
14. Works in Salines Ouest. This sites and services development was financed by the SID and completed
three years late though otherwise satisfactorily.
15.   Institutional Strengthening. This consisted of 612 person months of training and technical
assistance and vehicles and equipment for six agencies (see Table 5). The attempt to assist so many
agencies in the project met with very limited success due to its ambitious scope and the government's
decreasing capacity and interest in dealing with such a broad range of issues during the project period.
The large assistance plan did not have the desired impact because many technical assistants recruited did
not have technical counterparts who could be trained. Most technical assistants filled hierarchical
positions, and after their departure the situation remained as before or had deteriorated.  Much of the
technical assistance lost its relevance as initiatives in housing and development finance (CDD and SID)
stalled. Although vehicles and equipment were purchased for many of the agencies, funds for equipment
for the District of Djibouti were withheld at the end of the project to cover part of the shortfall for the
storm drain in Ward 7.
(a) MTPUL. The project provided grant financing for 237 person months instead of the estimated 204
person months for a team that included a sanitary engineer, an urban planner, a design engineer and a
surveyor. An economist to be financed for 48 months by the IDA Credit was not recruited.
(b) District of Djibouti The MCD grant financed a team that comprised a financial manager, a
mechanical engineer and a public works engineer who were recruited and completed a combined tenure
of 141 person months instead ofthe estimated 156 person months.
(c) Land Office. The IDA Credit provided an expert surveyor for 69 months, instead of 30 months.
(d) Banque de Developpement de Djibouti (BDD new name of CDD). The IDA Credit provided a
financial director for 24 months as planned, but the director of housing credit was not provided, because
the study on the establishment of a housing financing system was not carried out. The tasks of the
financial director provided were primarily to reorganize the institution and to reinforce the financial
departments by improving the financial procedures and internal audit. After two urban projects and 13
years of institutional strengthening efforts, BDD is virtually bankrupt. Since 1994, the BDD has
accumulated losses every year, totaling DF 882 million (US $5 million) at the end of 1997, or about 57
4



per cent of its capital stock. According to its statutes, the corporation should be dissolved. The
shareholders met in late 1998 and decided to auction off the capital assets.
(e) SID. The IDA Credit provided an administrative and financial director for 24 months instead of 48
months. A technical director to be grant-financed for 48 months was not provided, because necessary
decisions to restructure SID were never made. The tasks of the financial director were primarily to
reorganize the institution and to improve financial procedures and intemal audit. SID faced an
operating loss of about DF 50 million every year, compensated by exceptional profits of about the same
amount. Atthe end of 1997, SID had invested DF 130 million in BDD shares and had granted a loan of
DF 220 million to BDD and another of DF 50 million to the Government, without any reimbursement.
The provision for these investments was only DF 15 million. Theref6re, the loss could reach DF 385
million, because BDD is insolvent and the Government does not intend to reimburse this loan. It was
agreed at appraisal that the strengthening of SID would be conditional upon completion of its
reorganization (selling part of its housing stock, clearing customers' accounts, etc.) which was never
carried out. After two urban projects and 13 years of institutional strengthening efforts, this institution is
also virtually bankrupt.
(f) BPU. An expatriate technical adviser assisted the Project Unit for 33 months. Under the first urban
project, the Project Unit (BPU) performed well with the help of a technical assistant. This system was
adopted under the second urban project. There was nonetheless a slow start and contracting problems
(see para. 20).
16.    Studies. Four of seven studies were satisfactorily carried out (see Table 7). One study updated the
Djibouti Urban Development Plan and examined the needs of secondary towns.  However, the
recommendations of the Plan are unlikely to be used, given the high cost of some of the proposals and the
present lack of funds for development. A second study examined land tenure and tax collection in Djibouti. A
street signing study for Balbala was carried but not implemented. Another study to prepare a future project was
completed but has not been implemented. Three studies intended to examine the need for decentralization, help
establish a housing finance system, and examine households' ability to generate savings for housing were not
carried out.
17.    Housing Finance. Shortly after credit effectiveness, the government stopped recovering costs from
beneficiaries. Further, the government "borrowed" finances from the SID and BDD and severely constricted
their financial capabilities.
E.  IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
18.    Civil War and Refugees. The project was adversely affected by significant events that could not be
anticipated at the time of preparation. The civil war, which erupted in November 1991, two months after Credit
effectiveness delayed the project, diverted budget resources and jeopardized the Government's financial situation
so that it was unable to meet its counterpart requirements. This situation was aggravated by the estimated
120,000 refugees from neighboring Somalia and Kenya who fled their countries to seek protection in Djibouti.
This inflow increased the country's population by more than 20% in one year.
19.    Eroding Financial Environment. Growing budgetary pressures in donor countries together with
concerns about overall economic management, led to a sharp reduction in budgetary support. Direct
transfers which had been on the order of US $50-60 million per year fell to US $43 million in 1993, US
$24 million in 1994 and US $27 million in 1995, bringing about a sharp increase in financial deficits.
First, the Government financed the deficits by drawing on the Banque Nationale de Djibouti. It then
5



resorted to "borrowing" from more liquid parastatals. During implementation, in an effort to proceed with
the storm drainage component in Old Ward 7 (seepara. 12), the borrower offered to fund any financial
shortfalls, made a partial deposit into the special account, and requested IDA's approval to proceed.
Although several supervision missions recorded concern about the government's ability to meet this large
financial commitment, an IDA no-objection was provided.  Additional government funds did not
materialize and the rehabilitation of the Old Ward 7 could not be carried out solely with IDA funds.
20.    Slow Start and Delays Effectiveness came three months late in September 1991. In addition to
delays caused by the civil war, implementation also started slowly because design studies and bidding
documents were only partially prepared during projectpreparation. A post-negotiation mission in April 1991
urged the project unit to recruit a consulting finn to cany out the final design studies. Subsequently IDA was
slow in responding to the Government's procurement correspondence. On November 23, 1993, IDA rejected
the bidding documents for works, because they were not in accordance with guidelines. Documents were
finally ready in April 1994, three years after signing of the Credit Agreement.
21.    OPEC Financing Not Available. On December 4, 1990, the OPEC Fund approved a loan of US $1.9
million to co-finance the drainage and water supply works in Old Ward No.7. Because the Govermment was late
in providing necessary legal documents, this loan was declared effective three years later, on August 2, 1993.
Although there was a cross-effectiveness clause in the Development Credit Agreement [Section 6.01 (a)], it was
not observed when the credit was declared effective on September 27, 1991. This shortcoming was crucial
because the OPEC loan was never made available due to Djibouti's default on loan repayments to OPEC.
22.   Inadequate demand. At the onset of the SUDP, a major shortcoming of the UDP was becoming
apparent. Several streets constructed under the UDP were at a higher level than the surrounding plots, which
caused flooding in the homes. Second, while the UDP included a grant element favoring the beneficiary; the
SUDP did not. Third, in an effort to improve cost recovery, the govermment and IDA agreed to levy higher plot
prices. Fourth, a satisfactory mechanism for financing beneficiaries' purchases of land did not emerge. These
factors combined to help reduce the demand for the plots developed under the project.
23.    Cost Recovery System Compromised. The cost recovery system implemented under the UDP had
several elements; the proceeds were supposed to be deposited into the Ufban Development Fund (FDU) . At the
end of 1990, when the SUDP credit was declared effective, DF 320 million had been deposited into the FDU
account at the Treasury. The cash strapped government "borrowed" these funds from the project, only DF 75
million were reimbursed in February 1996. Annual plot fees were collected in Old Wards 1 to 7 and should have
been extended to the whole city, but in 1990 surveys were halted in Wards 7bis, Ambouli and Djebel, at
Government request. Until the end of 1989, the proceeds of the annual fees were budgeted for and not deposited
into the FDU. At the end of 1991, a few months after credit effectiveness, the collection of annual fees was
completely suspended. Amounts recovered by BDD as repayment of the housing loans contracted under the
first project have been deposited in the Treasury and never remitted to FDU. In June 1996, an IDA mission
estimated that the collection of fees was non-existent. In November 1997, an IDA mission reported that the
FDU had sold only 72 plots and recovered only DF 14 million against a target of 700 million for 1995. Only
after IDA threatened to suspend disbursements did the Government resume collections and deposit receipts into
anew FDU account in a commercial bank in 1998.
24.    Resettlement Unsuccessful. Project implementation required a resettlement program affecting about
300 families. While a resettlement plan based partly on the experience of the UDP was accepted by IDA, it was
not accepted by residents perhaps because it did not include a grant of land and required too much demolition of
existing housing. The residents refiused any displacement, and the first attempt led to violent riots. In response,
6



the Government decided to eliminate relocation and upgrading components in the dense areas of Old Ward 7
and the old center of Balbala. The experience reflects insufficient beneficiary consultation during project
preparation and implementation.
25.    Maintenance Unsuccessful A French NGO that was to provide five technicians who would assist
individual construction contractors, artisans, and small scale construction firms in maintaining the infrastmcture,
subsequently declined to provide this assistance and compromised the plan of maintaining the infrastructure.
French Cooperation Volunteers were also supposed to help educate communities concerning routine
infrastructure maintenance, but this assistance was never made available.
F.     PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
26.    The objectives of improving the managerial capacities of the institutions involved in the urban sector
and improving cost recovery have not been achieved. Therefore, it is likely that the works of the project, as
with those of the first project, and much of the equipment provided, will not be adequately maintained. The sale
of plots in Balbala could still help FDU finance the completion of the project and maintenance of the works, but
the deterioration of the economic situation has made this difficult. In addition, two major institutions of the
sector, BDD and SID, though supported by both the first and second urban projects, are virtually bankrupt. For
these reasons, the sustainability ofthe project is considered unlikely.
G.    IDA PERFORMANCE
27.   IDA's identification and preparation of the project was deficient. Some designs and procurement
delays appear to have contributed to the slow start to the project.  In retrospect, involving OPEC as a co-
financier rather than depending on parallel financing contributed to financing problems. Resettlement schemes
proved unacceptable to residents, reflecting probable insufficient beneficiary consultation. Before the end of the
First Urban Development Project it was becoming clear that cost recovery from residential plots was not
working as designed and that the development of housing finance under the BDD was breaking down. The
SUDP was prepared before this type of feedback was available to develop more realistic cost recovery
proposals. Appraisal of the project was also deficient because of the complexity of the project, involving a large
number of objectives, components and agencies, in a country with limited financial resources and capacity, was
not adequately evaluated. A more limited and focused set of objectives would have been preferable to the broad
approach undertaken.
28.    Arguably, the above shortcomings could not have appeared as serious at the time of preparation, before
the political and economic situation had deteriorated. However, IDA's reaction to these shortcomings was
deficient. Growing problems with cost recovery were noted in early supervision reports. In some cases, IDA
convinced the Government to resume collection of fees from beneficiaries. Several supervision missions also
wamed about the lack of counterpart funds, a problem that became increasingly serious to the point that a major
component was left unfinished. Poor communication and communication among project agencies and between
them and the government became increasingly apparent during implementation. However, in spite of the very
serious deterioration of the broader context and many project-specific problems, there was no mid-term review.
IDA did not formally and systematically reassess or propose simplification or restructuring of the project. Even
though there were significant concems about availability of finances, IDA gave its no-objection to the signing of
the largest civil works contract (US $7.2 million) without ensuring a plan for finishing the works if finances ran
out. These failings may have been caused in part by the reorganizations of IDA; Djibouti projects changed
departments twice in 1994 and 1997, with a complete change of responsible staff each time. There were seven
taskmanagers forthis projectfrom 1988to 1998. Overall, IDAperformanceistherefore considered deficient
7



H.  BORROWER PERFORMANCE
29.    The complexity ofthe project and its many objectives also indicate defident perfonnance on the part of
the Borrower during preparation. The difficult political and economic conditions were responsible for many of
the failures of the project, but the Government's inability to control the financial situation was a major
drawback. The Govemment faced severe financial problems and indeed received French grants with which it
financed counterpart funds. Government performance during implementation was deficient because it did not
take timely decisions to stop the deterioration of the SID and BDD financial situations. On the contrary, it
"borrowed" available funds and did not make substantive repayments. Therefore, the funds intended for the
institutional strengthening have been lost. The Government did not recover costs according to the original
agreements.
30.    The Project Unit's performance under this project was also deficient for the following reasons: (i) the
BPU took three years to prepare the bidding documents; (ii) the BPU launched the works of Old Ward 7 in
February 1996, five years after Board presentation; (iii) although the BPU knew that there were not enough
funds, it launched the works in Old Ward 7 without developing a contingency plan in case of a shortfall from
identified sources. Several covenants were not complied with in a timely manner (see table 10). Overall, the
Borrower's performance is considered deficient
I.     ASSESSMENT OF PROJECT OUTCOME
31.    The project failed to achieve many of the objectives intended at appraisal. Significant portions ofthe
physical components are still incomplete and few institutional improvements are evident. The outcome of the
project is considered unsatisfactory.
J.     FUTVRE OPERATIONS
32.    It is unclear how the borrower is going to finance incomplete works, and what steps they are likely to
take to make this project sustainable. The present set of donors have not indicated a willingness to finance the
completion of the project's physical works. The Government is seeking assistance from the European Union,
which may agree to provide funds if private sector participation is increased. A schedule for completing this
project is not currently available.
K.  KEY LESSONS LEARNED
This project offers several key lessons:
* Especially in countries with limited capacity, projects should focus on a limited set of objectives that are
within the Government's ability to manage, and objectives should focus on fundamental issues. The number
of agencies and government ministries to be involved should be carefully considered.
* Where a follow-on project is prepared, it would be preferable to appraise the project after the lessons
from the first operation are evident.
* Projects affected by severe changes in the broader context, such as civil war or serious economic decline,
should be reassessed. The original objectives or complexity of the project may no longer be feasible.
Restructuing, cancellation of some components or curtailment of the entire project may be required. Mid-
8



tenm reviews are essential in these cases. Each component should be scrutinized to see if it is still sensible
within the changed context and whether sufficient financial and supervision resources are available.
a In cases where counterpart fumding problems are likely to develop, it would be preferable for donors to
finance distinct components. Parallel financing would put individual components at less risk than under co-
financing.
* Continuity of IDA staff and good record keeping are necessary to successfully supervise a project:
Reorganization at IDA and several changes of responsible staff undoubtedly had a negative influence on the
quality of project ownership, on monitoring of key issues such as credit effectiveness, and on supervision.

Table 9: Economic Rate of Return
A re-calculation of the economic rate of return is precluded by the unavailability of relevant data,
but there are several indications that the true rate of return will be significantly lower than
estimated at appraisal. The following discussion helps provide an indication of the magnitude of
the difference.
This discussion is based on the economic analysis presented in the SAR (page 30, and Annex 12).
Key features of that analysis are that it considered only the physical components, based its cost
projections on the engineering estimates, benefit projections on increases in property and rental
values, and did not provide full detail that may facilitate an independent recalculation.
The following results are provided, and have been re-examined at closing.
Old Wards                        20%         Cost over-rums and delayed benefits from grant
financed elements. Drainage Canal abandoned
and currently unusable.
Balbala                          30%         Cost over-runs and delayed benefits from grant
financed works. IDA financed works stopped.
Salines Ouest                    29%         Completed satisfactorily, three years late.
Institutional Strengthening    Not Estimated  Negligible Returm.
Combined Estimate          22% for 65% of   Less than 10% for entire project.
total project costs.
The sensitivity analysis conducted at appraisal included the following information that facilitates
a limited extrapolation of the economic return at closing (see SAR Annex 12, pages 77 and 78).
* "a 25% reduction in project benefits reduces the economic rate of return of the project to 14.4%"
*  "a 15% increase in project construction costs reduces economic retums to 18%"
Cost recovery has not been satisfactorily effected thereby reducing project benefits. It is also clear
that project costs are significantly higher than anticipated. If the US $4.5 million estimate of
completing the physical components is accurate then the combined costs of these components are
approximately 25% above original estimates. It is reasonable to expect that the impact of a co-
occurrence of increased costs and diminished benefits would reduced the realized economic rate
of return on the physical components to below 15%. If the negligible impact of the institutional
component is factored in, the combined economic rate of return on the entire investment may
reasonably be expected to be below 10%, perhaps significantly so.

REPUBLIQUE DE DJIBOUTI
SECOND PROJET DE DEVELOPPEMENT URBAIN
AIDE-MEMOIRE
Introduction
1.   Une mission de la Banque Mondiale a visite Djibouti du 25 Juin au ler
Juillet 1998, pour la cloture du Crddit 2203-DJI, fixee au 30 Juin 1998. La
mission etait composee de M. Gerard Tenaille, Consultant. Elle remercie M.
Kadir Abdallah, Chef des Projets Urbains de Djibouti, de son accueil et de sa
cooperation, ainsi que les autres personnalites rencontrees, dont la liste
figure en annexe a cet aide-memoire.
Situation c6nerale du Profet
2.   Dans Ilensemble, le projet a environ trois ans de retard sur le
calendrier de realisation etabli lors de la mission d'evaluatfon, en Juin 1990.
Le Credit IDA No. 2203-DJI est entre en vigueur le 27 Septembre 1991, mais les
travaux n'ont reellement et lances qu'en 1995, principalement & cause des
evenements politiques qui ont secoue le pays de Novembre 1991 au 26
Decembre 1994.
3.   Les composantes financees par l'Union Europeenne (UE), l'Agence
Francaise de Developpement (AFD) et le Ministere Francais de la Cooperation
(MCD), ont des retards mais les travaux se deroulent de facon satisfaisante
et seront tous termines avant la fin de l'annee 1998. L'AFD a contribue au bon
deroulement des travaux en prenant a sa charge certains des fonds de
contrepartie dfus par le Gouvernement, non seulement sur les composantes
qu'elle financait, mais egalement sur la composante IDA du Quartier 7, a
hauteur de 138.151.656 FDJ.
Situation du Ouartier 7
4 .   La principale composante financee par l'IDA, le Quartier 7, a ete
handicapee pour deux raisons qui se sont conjuguees:
a:   la contrepartie du Gouvernement etait de 30%; et
b:   cette composante etait cofinancee par le Fonds de l'OPEP.
Ces dispositions etaient valables en 1990, mais elles ne letaient plus apres
trois ans de guerre civile. Le Gouvernement n'avait plus les ressources
financiAres pour fournir sa contrepartie, ni pour rembourser & l'OPEP un pret
anterieur (Projet Geothermnie), ce qui a entraine la suspension du pret OPEP
(1,9 minion US$).
5.   Il ne restait donc que les fonds du Credit IDA pour financer les travaux
du Quartier 7, soit environ 4 millions US$ pour des travaux estimes a 8 millions
US$ ! Si le Gouvernement avait averti la Banque Mondiale, en 1995, de son
incapacite a remplir ses obligations financieres, il eut ete facile, avant le
debut des travaux, de redefinir cette composante pour executer un ensemble
30



2
coherent avec les seuls fonds de l'IDA, par exemple un seul des deux canaux
de drainage qui ont ete commences mais sont toujours inacheves.
6.   Malgre l'indisponibilite du Credit OPEP et des fonds de contrepartie du
Gouvernement, I'appel d'offres a etd lancd en 1995 pour les travaux de voirie
et reseaux divers du Quartier 7. Un marche a ete signe avec la SADE, sous
le No. 08/95/BP, approuve le 22 Janvier 1996 et notifie le 7 Fevrier 1996, pour
un montant de 23.317.415,61 FF et 218.484.184 FDJ.  Les travaux ont
commence le 10 Mars 1996, et le delai contractuel etait de deux ans. Les
travaux de drainage ont ete handicapes des le debut par les reseaux d'eau,
electricite et telephone, dont le deplacement n'a pas ete realise par les
concesssionnaires, par manque de financement gouvernemental. Les canaux
ont cependant ete creuses, avec un arret au croisement de chaque rue
importante. I1 y a ainsi 8 points d'interruption du rdseau de drainage hors
site. Les sections executees servent evidemment de depotoirs & ordures
menageres, et la plupart sont pleines d'eau.
7.   Les travaux sont totalemnent arretes depuis le ler Septembre 1997,
l'entreprise ayant vu les arrieres cumules atteindre PR7S DE 400 millions FDJ.
Les travaux in situ avaient dejA ete suspendus, par suite des memes problemes
de financement et des difficultes de decasement.
8.   Par lettre du 28 Janvier 1998, le Gouvernement proposait & la Banque
Mondiale le plan d'action suivant:
(a) reaffectation des fonds du Credit IDA a la categorie 1 (Genie civil),
pour les consacrer au Quartier 7;
(b)  deblocage immediat du pret OPEP, par paiement des arrieres, qui se
montaient au 31 janvier 1998 & 375.320,44 US$ (66,7 millions FDJ);
(c)   mise a disposition de la SAS 2eme tranche de la CFD; et
(d)  prise en charge des deplacements de reseaux existants par les
concessionnaires.
9.   Sur ces quatre actions proposees par le Gouvernement, deux ont ete
executees: l'IDA a verse environ 200 mnllions FDJ A Itentreprise, et la CFD
138.151.656 FDJ. Mais les deux actions a la charge du Gouvernement n'ont
pas ete executees: les arrieres duis a l'OPEP n'ont pas ete completement
regles, et les concessionnaires n'ont pas les moyens financiers de prendre a
leur charge les 200 millions FDJ que represente le deplacement des reseaux.
10.  Les depenses restant A engager pour finir les travaux se montent a:
Arrieres restant duas a la SADE:        124 millions FDJ
Fin des travaux hors site:              288.5
Deplacements des reseaux:               200
Revision de prix                         39
Parite des taux de change                91
Interets moratoires                      22.5
Les besoins de financement sont donc de: 765 millions FDJ (4,3 rnillions U`S$).
31



3
Mesures a prendre pour achever le Ouartier 7
11.  Les possibilites de financement sont les suivantes:
(a)  Le Gouvernement s'est engage a regulariser sa situation avec l'OPl:^
ce qui permettra de debloquer 337,630,000 FDJ.
(b)  Le Fonds de Developpement Urbain (FDU) a ete cree dans le cadre du
ler Projet Urbain, pour recevoir les recettes de vente de parcelles et
financer de nouveaux projets urbains. Son compte au Tesor se montait
au ler janvier 1998 & 224.636.947 FDJ.
(c)  Enfin, Monsieur le Ministre des Travaux Publics a assure a la mission,
le ler juillet 1998, que les concessionnaires deplaceraient leurs reseaux
d'eau, d'electricite et de telephone a leurs frais, conume decide le 20
Janvier 1998 par le Comnite Interministeriel.   Ceci represente
200.353.550 FDJ.
12.  Thdoriquement, le projet disposerait donc de 762,6 millions FDJ, soit le
montant necessaire pour l'achevement de la composante du Quartier 7. La
mission recommande que le Gouvernement precise a la Banque comment il
compte debloquer ces financements, et dans quels delais.
Rapport d1Acghvenent
13.  D'unefagonplus generale, lamission preparerale rapport d'achevement
de P'ensenmble du projet, qui sera adresse au Gouvernement, probablement au
debut de Septembre 1998. De son cote, l'Emprunteur doit preparer son
propre rappoTt d4acb6vement, qui sera joint a celui de la Banque.

Attention Monsieur Jeffrey S.RACKI
Directeur Secteur Eau et Urbainl
Region Afrique
Objet: Djibouti . Rapport d'achevement du PDUDII
Monsieur le Directeur,
J'ai bien requ la version preliminaire en anglais du rapport cite en objet et vous en remercie.
Je me permets de formuler les remarques suivantes:
Sur un plan general:
* Ce rapport est severe mais nous parait objectif, dans la mesure ohi il reflete bien la realite
du relatif echec que constitue le PDUDII.
* Le rapport intervient certes a la cl6ture de la partie financee par la Banque Mondiale, mais
alors que le projet lui me&me n'est pas acheve. De ce fait, certains aspects relatifs a la
durabilit6 du proj et, a son caractere reproductible, soit ne sont pas evoqu6s, soit font l'obj et
&'affirmations encore non verifiable. Pour exemple, il est prevu que la vente des 3400
parcelles de Balbala vienne alimenter le Fonds de Developpement Urbain (FDU) et
assurer ainsi la perenite du systeme... Meme s'il parait probable que les ventes ne
s'effectueront ni au prix ni selon les modalites prevus, et que nous nous dirigeons, la aussi
vers un echec, il est en toute honnetete un peu premature d'affirmer l'echec de ce volet.
* Le rapport ne mentionne pas la non mise en oeuvre d'un credit immobilier qui devait
accompagner les equipements physiques et favoriser l'acces des populations a la propriete.
* Un des facteurs du retard considerable enregistre dans la mise en oeuvre du projet, que je
n'ai pas retrouve dans le rapport, fut l'incapacite des pouvoirs publics a obtenir les
decasements necessaires a certains volets du projet
Quelques points de detail concernant uniquement le resume:
* Page i, Preface, paragraphe 2: Si l'on on inclut l'Avenue 13, qui fait partie du PDUDII,
la contribution de l'AFD au projet global est de 1 IMUS$ (7 Balbala + 4 Avenue 13)
* Page ii, paragraphe 5 : je propose de remplacer "these helped make some improvements
to the urban setting" par "...significative improvements..."
* Page iii, paragraphe 9, avant-derniere phrase: "the Govemment partly corrected these
problems in 1998". Cette affirmation nous semble un peu optimiste. La collecte des
redevances domaniales reste tres insatisfaisante.
* Page iv, paragraphe 12 : un des facteurs qui, de notre point de vue, a rendu le suivi de la
Banque Mondiale insuffisant est l'absence de representation permanante de la Banque a
Djibouti, qui aurait pu tirer la sonnette d'alarme plus t6t.

Attention Monsieur Jeffrey S.RACKI
Directeur Secteur Eau et Urbain I
Region Afrique
Objet: Djibouti . Rapport d'achevement du PDUDII
Monsieur le Directeur,
J'ai bien recu la version preliminaire en fran,ais du rapport cite en objet et vous en remercie.
Je me permets de formuler les remarques suivantes, qui completent celles relatives a la
version anglaise au niveau de quelques points de detail:
* Page 2, paragraphe 11: Si l'on on inclut l'Avenue 13, qui fait partie du PDUDII, la
contribution de l'AFD au projet global est de 1 lMUS$ (7 Balbala + 4 Avenue 13)
* Page 4, paragraphe 14: Les 0,7 million de dollars accordes par l'AFD pour tenter de
remedier au probleme du financement de l'assainissement du quartier 7 l'ont ete au titre
de l'apurement des arrieres interieurs de l'Etat Djiboutien dans le cadre d'une subvention
d'ajustement structurel (SAS) accordee par l'Etat Frangais pour soutenir le programme du
FMI.
* Page 5, paragraphe 17-d: une assemblee generale extraordinaire de la BDD s'est tenue au
cours du dernier trimestre 1998 afm de proposer aux actionnaires un plan de redressement
fonde sur la capitalisation des creances detenues par d'autres etablissements publics (dont
la SID)
 Page 6, paragraphe 22: A l'origine seul l'assainissement de l'avenue 13 devait etre finance
a 100% par I'AFD. L'amenagement des 3600 parcelles de balbala comportait une
contrepartie locale que l'Etat Djiboutien n'a pu honorer pour les raisons que le rapport
souligne. Devant cet etat de fait l'AFD a decide en cours de projet d'utiliser les montants
initialement affectes aux imprevus pour financer la contrepartie nationale.
* Tableau 8B- financement du projet: le taux de 180% mentionne pour le financement de
l'AFD doit etre relativise car il est dui a la prise en compte du financement de
l'assainissement de l'avenue 13 (22 M.FRF) qui n'etait pas prevu initialement.
Je vous reitere mes remerciements et vous prie d'agreer, Monsieur le Directeur, l'assurance de
ma consideration distinguee.
Le directeur p.i.
