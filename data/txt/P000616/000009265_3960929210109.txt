MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF DJIBOUTI
FOR A SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Second
Urban Development Project to the Republic of Djibouti for SDR 7.8 million
(US$11.2 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years' maturity and would support
implementation of the government's strategy for the urban sector.  The
project would be cofinanced by EEC (US$10.5 million equivalent); Ministry of
Cooperation and Development-France (MCD) (US$8.1 million equivalent); CCCE
(US$6.5 million equivalent); and OPEC Fund (US$1.9 million).
PART I - COUNTRY POLICIES AND BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
2.         A report entitled "Economic Situation and Prospects of Djiboutiu
(Report No. 4692-DJI) was distributed to the Executive Directors in October
1984. A more recent economic report entitled "Djibouti - The Challenge of a
City-State" has been sent to the government for review. Djibouti has no
program with the IMF. This section reviews recent economic performance and
assesses the medium-term outlook as well as steps taken or contemplated by
the government to overcome the country's development constraints. It also
provides an overview of the Bank's assistance strategy. Country economic
and social indicators are in Schedule E.
BackRround
3.         Djibouti became independent in 1977.  It is a samall city-state
of only 23,000 sq km, occupying a strategic location in the Horn of Africa.
With a highly skewed income distribution, the vast majority of its 400,000
to 450,000 inhabitants have poor nutritional and health standards. Djibouti
has received in the 1980s some 60,000 refugees and immigrants from Somalia
and Ethiopia, exacerbating social and economic conditions. Life expectancy
is low and infant mortality high, despite a significant improvement over the
past decade, when these indicators improved from 42 to 47 years, and from
147 to 115 per thousand, respectively. According to the UN classification,
Djibouti belongs to the least developed countries group. However, its GNP
per capita is estimated to be higher than that of most of the countries in
this group, due essentially to the presence of a large expatriate community.
4.         Djibouti has come a long way from a nomadic tradition to a more
modern economy. The economy is, nevertheless, fragile and highly dependent
on external assistance. Agriculture and industry are little developed,
owing to the harsh climate, high production cost and limited natural
resources and domestic skills. The tertiary sector dominates the economy,
contributing nearly 70 percent to GDP. Its mainstay are services provided
to the French military personnel stationed in Djibouti and trade with
neighboring countries. Other activities are related to the traditional role
of Djibouti as a regional center due to its port facilities, private banking
and telecommunication services, and, to a lesser extent, its international



- 2 -
airport and railroad link to Addis Ababa. Merchandise exporte of local
origin are insignificant, and the country depends heavily on imported food
and consumer goods. Djibouti has one of the moat liberal economic regimes
in Africa. Its currency is freely convertible and has been pegged to the US
dollar since 1949 with a view to enhancJ.ng Djibouti's role as a regional
trade and service center. However, the economy ia distorted by high vage
and price levels, which reduce Djibouti's international competitiveness.
Assessment of Performance and Medium-Term Outlook
5.          After growing at a rate of 3 percent per annum during 1978-
1982, Djibouti's GDP declined by an average of 2.7 percent per annum
between 1984 and 1987. The economy was severely hurt by the decline in
demand for local goods and services from the expatriate community due to the
appreciation of the Djibouti Franc in 1985-1986, in addition to the
recession in private housing construction since 1984. The decline in
economic activity, combined with the large influx of refugees from Somalia
and Ethiopia, has led to acute unemployment in Djibouti. The economic
situation improved moderately in 1988 owing to more frequent port calls by
the French navy and the depreciation of the US dollar. However, the economy
suffered a setback in 1989 due partly to floods that affected about half of
the population in the capital. Further decline in economic activity is
expected in 1990 as a result of the Gulf crisis. The negative impact of the
crisis is reflected in a higher import bill and a significant los. of sales
of services due to a sharp decline in commercial ship traffic in the port of
Djibouti. However, this loss will be partly compensated by additional
revenues from increased visits by warships to the Djibouti port. The
decline in real GDP between 1984 and 1989 and a population growth rate of 6
percent a year (of which 3 percent is due to the influx of immigrants and
refugees) led to a severe reduction of about 35 percent in per capita
consumption over the period.

1/ Excluding grants.
6.          The overall budget deficit (including grants) remains worrisome
although it has improved during the last few years due to new tax measures
and the reduction of domestically-financed capital expenditure. Budget
deficits have been financed largely by external grants (around 16 percent of
GDP) and drawing on cash reserves and external borrowing. With cash
reserves almost depleted in 1987, the government adopted additional
austerity measures to curtail expenditures, with increased grants from
France; thus reducing the deficit from 5 percent of GDP in 1987 to an
estimated 2.2 percent in 1989 (or 17 percent if grants are excluded.) In
the external sector, the current account balance deteriorated in 1989 due to



- 3 -
tne sluggish sales of services, an increase in the import bill for food and
consumer goods and a decline in investment income.
7.         Djibouti's external debt rose from US$96 million in 1985 to
US$133 million at the end of 1989, or about 33 percent of GDP, due to high
borrowing in the early 1980s to finance public investment projects. About
sixty percent of the external debt is owed to Arab creditors.  IDA holds
about 20 percent of total debt, followed by the African Development Bank (16
percent). Although most of the external borrowing was on highly
concessional terms, Djibouti's debt service payments quadrupled from US$4
million in 1985 to US$15 million in 1989, representing about 6 percent of
exports of goods and services and 10 percent of budgetary revenues,
including grants. Djibouti has been current in its external debt service
payments.
8.         Medium-Term Outlook.  In the face of an uncertain economic
outlook, the most likely scenario in the medium term is a "muddling-through"
situation with modest recovery in economic growth. Given Djibouti's weak
development base and limited institutional capacity to implement changes,
real GDP would grow, during the next few years, at best by an average of 2
percent a year. Most of this growth is likely to be generated by the
secondary sector and the recovery of some service activities, in particular
transport and commerce, given government efforts to compress wages. The
primary sector is expected to constitute only a marginal source of growth
since the sector is small and Djibouti is vulnerable to drought and other
natural celamities.
9.         During the next few years, Djibouti is expected to go through a
period of austerity requiring cuts in government spending, both current and
capital, and certain policy reforms to increase competitiveness in the
international market. Nevertheless, the basic characteristics of the
economy are expected to be maintained, specifically as regards the continued
presence of the French military at its present level. Also, because in- and
*          out-migration are determined largely by political developments in
neighboring countries which are difficult to predict, net migration is
expected to continue although at a slower pace on account of recent
Government efforts to contain the flow.  Should immigration continue at its
current level, the social situation could further deteriorate, as would the
financial and balance of payments situation, and Djibouti would need
additional resources to provide these immigrants with basic needs, health
care and employment opportunities.
10.        Djibouti will continue to be highly dependent on external
assistance, both financial and and technical. The balance of payments
situation is likely to remain constrained, with prospects of limited export
expansion and rising imports of food and consumer goods. To enable Djibouti
to meet needed import payments, its debt service obligations and to maintain
foreign exchange reserves at around 3 months equivalent of imports, future
external financing requirements are likely to be on the order of about US$60
million a year during 1991-95. Given Djibouti's limited capacity to service
debt, external financing would have to be on highly concessionary termas.



- 4 -
Moreover, technical assistance would continue to be needed to strengthen
administrative capacity, aid coordination and institution building.
Development Issues and Oblectives
11.        The constraints on economic development in Djibouti are
substantial; they are those of a dualistic economy with a small modern
sector based on a relatively well-developed infrastructure and expatriate
skills, contrasting with a larger traditional society close to a subsistence
level. The government is confronted with a number of economic issues which
are particularly difficult to resolve in view of the social and political
configuration of the country. A Country Economic Memorandum, under
discussion with the government, stresses the need for continued austerity
measures and for a policy package that could help improve Djibouti's long-
terra development prospects. This includes measures to ensure
competitiveness, improve marketing skills and strengthen management
capacity, revise labor legislation, and upgrade the labor force through
appropriate training. Against this background, the government's development
objectives are to (i) stabilize the budget situation and improve the use of
public resources; (ii) foster activities that could provide permanent
employment to the growing labor force and develop geothermal energy; and
(iii) develop human resources and alleviate poverty.
12.        Stabilization of budget situation and imDrovement of public
sector manatement.  In public finance, the government has taken a number of
actions to curtail the budgetary deficit in the context of the 1989 and 1990
budget. The measures include wage compression through adoption of a new pay
scale with much lower salaries for new recruits and replacement of full
rental housing costs by more moderate housing allowances for school teachers
(who are highly paid by regional standards). In addition, conservation
measures on the use of electricity and motor vehicles have been reinforced,
missions abroad have been reduced and overtime pay has been replaced by
compensatory leave. On the revenue side, efforts were made to improve tax
collection by strengthening tax administration. In the parapublic sector,
the government has entrusted management of the state-owned hotel to a
private company and is seeking to privatize the bottling and dairy products
plants, which have incurred losses in recent years. An audit report has
been prepared for the airport authority and a rehabilitation program is
under consideration. With regard to investment programming, a positive
development has been the creation of an interministerial planning commission
to coordinate external aid to Djibouti and examine investment projects.
Noteworthy also are the emerging concern of the authorities about recurrent
cost implications associated with public investments and their efforts to
limit capital spending to projects financed with grants.
13.        Promotion of productive activities and employment creation.  In
the productive and service sectors, the government is seeking ways to
promote activities that could contribute to economic growth and provide
employment to the growing labor force. Significant investments have been
made to modernize infrastructure in the service sector. As a result,
Djibouti has one of the most developed ports in the region, a fairly modern
airport and an excellent telecommunications system. Unfortunately, most of



- 5 -
these facilities are underutilized, prompting the government to begin a
reexamination of their operating conditions with a view to increasing
efficiency and reducing costs.  While continuiny to strengthen the service
sector, the authorities are now exploring the possibility of encouraging the
development of the manufacturing sector. Assistance has been obtained from
UNIDO to promote small- and medium-scale industries. Moreover, a committee,
with participation from the private sector, has been set up to examine the
possibility of creating an export processing zone in the existing free trade
zone at the port and to review measures which could improve Djibouti's
external competitiveness, including freely negotiated wages and minimal
labor regulations for the zone. In light of the sizable geothermal sources
in Djibouti, one of the country's few natural resources, the government has
given high priority to the development of commercial geothermal energy. In
agriculture, government continues to encourage fisheries and fooderop
development, within the limits imposed by the scarcity of arable land and
water.
14.        Human resource development and poverty alleviation.  In the
social sectors, the government assigns high priority to human resource
development through strengthening the education and training system and
improving health and living conditions. Efforts are being made to expand
primary education, in particular in the underprivileged areas, and to
increase access to post-primary education, as well as to improve the
relevance of education and vocational training to labor market needs. In
addition, measures to contain the high unit cost of education have been
adopted and a double shift system is under consideration to meet the needs
of the fast growing population and the high immigration. To reduce poverty,
the government has made significant efforts to improve the living conditions
of the urban poor through provision of basic infrastructure, affordable
housing and water supply. In the hinterland, with assistance from various
donors, the government has built water wells wherever feasible to provide
water to several thousands of nomads and their herds. Although significant
progress has been made in the social sectors, a more comprehensive program
is underway with IDA and bilateral support to upgrade manpower skills and
improve the living conditions of the poor.
15.        Protection of the environment.  The environmental issues facing
the city-state of Djibouti are predominantly urban and the government's
efforts in urban planning and development have been largely guided by
concern for environment protection. Furthermore, the government has
undertaken a project to protect what remains of the "Day Forest" with
assistance from UNDP and IFAD.  Finally, experiments are underway to develop
desert agriculture, which could help Djibouti diversify its economy as well
as protect the environment.
Relations with the Bank and the Composition of Past Lendint
16.        The Bank's objective has been to assist the Djibouti government
in poverty reduction, development of human resources, institution building,
and development of geothermal energy, which is one of the country's few
natural resources. Since joining the Bank Group in October 1980, Djibouti
has received seven IDA credits for a total amount of US$39.4 million, or one



- 6-
or two projecte every two years.  A large share of IDA credits has financed
projects ln the social sectors (human resources and urban development) and
geothermal onergy.  Projact implementation has, in general, been
satisfactory with the exception of the technical assistance (TA) project,
which took a long time to be completed due to a shortage of quallfled
counterpart staff. This TA project was closed in 1989 and the unused study
funds were cancelled. The geothermal development project, approved ln June
1989, has experienced major start-up difficulties which are being addressed
in cooperation with co-financiers.

17.        The Bank's operations have been pursued in a climate of general
satisfaction with the government and there exists a general receptivity to
the Bank's advice on sectoral issues, despite the implementation problems
with the TA project. In human resources, the two Bank financed projects in
education and manpower development have helped the government to achieve the
following: the quality of education and vocational training has been
improved and access to basic education has been increased, in particular in
the underpriviledged areas; in addition, the cost-efficiency in the
education sector has improved and the institutional capacity with regard to
sector planning and management has been strengthened. In energy, the
exploration phase led to the discovery of sizable geothermal energy sources;
the geothermal development project, expected to be completed by 1993, would
supply geothermal electricity of about one-third of the country's base load
and help reduce the importation of petroleum products by about 10 percent.
In urban development, the first project has upgraded the living conditions
of the old quarters of the city and positive results have been observed, in
particular during the 1989 flood when half of the city was under water
whereas the old wards assisted under the project were well drained. In
institution building, although the TA project did not succeed in
strengthening the administrative capacity of the planning directorate
because of personnel problems, the management capacity of institutions in
the sectors in which the Bank is active has been improved; i.e., education,
urban, roads and energy.
18.        The Bank dialogue on macro issues has improved, alth:.>.'h still
difficult, through the discussions of the CEM.  First round di..curisions,
which took place in September 1990, resulted in broad agreemen- or. the



diagnosis presented in the report as well as on tle development challenges
the country faces over the long run. Further discussions are planned in the
next few months.
Country Assistance Strateyv end Priorities
19.        The Bank's assistance strategy aims specifically at addressing
the basic needs of the poor seg.aent of the population and at reinforcing
institutional capacity. At the macro level, the Bank's objective is to
continue to provide analysis and advice on economic policies and development
issues. At the project level, Bank strategy is to lend periodically to
maintain a minimum presence in the country. Prospects for an increased Bank
role in Djibouti in terms of adjustment lending are limited, and the Bank
would expect Djibouti's main traditional bilateral donors to take the lead
in providing the assistance required. In aid coordination, the Bank will
seek to maximize co-financing opportunities in sectors of direct involvement
and continue to share its analytical work and assessment of the country's
economic constraints and prospects.
20.        The Bank's current lending program for FY91-FY94 consists of two
projects: a second urban development project (FY91) and a transport
rehabilitation project (FY93). Building on the success of the first urban
project, the main objectives of the proposed second urban development
project are to improve the living conditions of the urban poor, and to
render the urban setting more efficient and more attractive for Djibouti's
role as a regional center for service, finance and transit trade. Moreover,
this project establishes a framework for donor support to the urban sector,
with five co-donors providing more than 50 percent of the total financing
required. Since physical infrastructure in Djibouti is adequate for the
present needs of the country, emphasis would be placed on maximizing the
utilization of the port and the railroad, and increasing the local capacity
for carrying out road maintenance operations. A population project,
currently in reserve status for FY93, could be activated once government
receptivity is confirmed. Future ESW work will foeus on health and
population issues.
Summary Assessment
21.        In the face of an uncertain economic outlook, a change in policy
is needed to stop the declining trend in economic activity and to generate
job opportunities for the rapidly growing population, exacerbated by the
influx of immigrants and refugees. The goirernment has introduced--with some
success--certain corrective measures to improve the economic and financial
situation. It will need to accentuate budgetary discipline through wage
compression and reductions in other expenditures. The Bank's key priority
is to assist the goverrnment in providing for the basic needs of the poor
segment of the population. The Bank's assistance strategy is supported by
periodic project lending and a limited ESW program. There are currently
limited prospects for an increased Bank's role in Djibouti in terms of
adjustment lending. Concurrently with efforts to strengthen the policy
dialogue with the government, the Bank will continue to share its analytical



- 8 -
work with Djiboutls' bilateral partners and seek to maximize co-financing
opportunities for projecta in which it is directly involved.
PART II - THE PROJECT
Backzround
22.        Over the past several years the urban population has grown by
about 6% per year owing to internal migration and the influx of refugees
from neighboring countries. About two-thirds of the couutry's population
live in Djibouti city. Expatriates and a small number of high-income
Djiboutians live in low-density areas north of the commercial center and in
military compounds around the city. The "Old Wards" of the inner city, by
contrast, are densely settled by about 65% of the city's population. In the
overcrowded parts of the city, people live in poor conditions and
malnutrition is a problem.
23.        A plan for the long-term development of the city of Djibouti vas
prepared in 1981 with financing from the European Development Fund.  The
plan recommended the upgrading of existing urban districts, the development
of new residential areas to the west of the city, the improvement of
conditions in Balbala (the poorest section of the city) and the correction
of drainage problems in the Old Wards.
24.        The first urban project was designed to improve the living
conditions of the urban poor in the city of Djibouti, introduce adequate
cost recovery and land tenure measures and strengthen the absorptive
capacity of the key agencies involved in the urban sector. The project has
successfully upgraded 'Old Wards" no. 3 and 5, and is presently undertaking
the same effort for Ward no. 6. In Balbala the upgrading and the
construction of a market have also been carried out satisfactorily. On the
institutional aspects, measures to etrengthen the District of Djibouti
(DD),the Project Management Unit (PMU) and the Land Office (LO) have
resulted in satisfactory cost recovery mechaa4sms and land use procedures.
An urban development fund wau established to nance urban programs with the
proceeds of plot sales. The results were less satisfactory in the case of
the development bank (Caisse de Développement de Djibouti - CDD), as delays
were encountered in the formulation of a housing finance policy for the
sector.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
25.        The second urban development project would mak  a further
contribution to preparing the city-state of Djibouti for its service-
oriented role in the region, a strategy which IDA supports. The project
would expand the significant impact of its predecessor to a larger segment
of the population. It would also deepen policy reforms introduced in the
first project, particularly those related to land tenure and cost recovery.
The proposed project would also continue strengthening institutions
operating in the urban sector. This is important since the funds allocated
to this project amount to a sizeable share of public investment during the



- 9 -
implementation period. IDA's contribution would represent only 25% of
project cost, as its involvement has attracted a strong donor participation
on favorable terms.  The project would help expand job prospects in the
service sector and the construction industry and would improve the living
conditions of the low income areas of the Old Wards and Balbala. The
project is in line with government priorities to strengthen urban
institutions and improve the effectiveness and financial viability of the
urban sector.
Proiect Objectives
26.        The main objectives of the project are to: a) strengthen the
policy making and coordination capacity of the urban sector; b) strengthen
institutions responsible for the management of urban growth; c) promote
secure land tenure for all population groups; d) help render the urban
setting more efficient and more attractive for Djibouti's role as a reg'enal
center for services, finance, and transit trade; e) improve the urban
environment and the living conditions of the urban poor with provision of
basic infrastructure; f) study housing finance mechanisms (especially for
low income households); g) improve cost recovery practices and the revenue
base of agencies in the urban sector; and h) support the decentralization
process initiated by the government.
Prolect Description
27.        The proposed project  'ould include the following components: a)
Old Wards: rehabilitation of roads and drainage works and improvement of
water supply and electricity distribution network in Wards 1, 2 and 7;
construction of an off-site drainage system in Wards 1 to 6 and preparation
of detailed studies for Wards 7 bis, Djebel and Ambouli; b) Balbala:
development of 3600 serviced plots including the construction of two
markets; construction of the primary system in the future expansions;
rehabilitation of the old center and naming of the existing blocks and
*           plots; c) Sàlines Ouest: development of 228 serviced plots on the Salines
Ouest site owned by Société Immobilière de Djibouti (SID); and d)
institutional support: technical support including staffing, training,
studies and equipment for the Ministry of Public "arks, Urban Planning and
Housing, DD, LO, SID, CDD, and the PMU. This institution-building component
would help government and urban institutions efficiently coordinate sector
policies and investments.
Prolect Cost
28.        The total cost of the project net of taxes is estimated at
US$45.5 million equivalent, with foreign costs of US$30.7 million and local
costs of US$14.8 million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A.  Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.  A
timetable of key project processing events, the status of Bank Group
operations in Djibouti, and economic indicators are given in Schedules C, D
and E, respectively. A Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9037-DJI dated December
10, 1990, is being distributed separately.

Actions agreed
29.        Assurances were obtained from the government to: (a)  issue a
statement of sectoral development policy, with an action plan, and extend
the responsibility of the interministerial committee, presently overseeing
the first project, to the entire sector; (b) improve security of land tenure
and cost recovery by (i) updating urban legislation and (ii) further
simplifying building permit procedures and extending them to the city as a
whole; and (c) have project accounts of PMU, SID, CDD and the Urban
Development Fund audited by external auditors acceptable to IDA and make
available for Bank annual review and comment an updated three-year
investment and expenditure program for the urban sector.
Environmental Impact
30.        The project would improve drainage, sanitation and other
physical environnental conditions for about 80,000 people in the city of
Djibouti; no activities in the proposed project would create significant
adverse environmental effects. The physical, health and socio-economic
conditions of the urban population would be greatly improved as a result of
the upgrading of urban infrastructure and provision of urban services such
as solid waste collection and drainage maintenance. These combined actions
would significantly reduce the health hazards resulting from existing
unsanitary conditions in project areas.
Benefits
31.        The project is expected to consolidate the basis for sustainable
urban development initiated under the first urban project and strengthen the
functioning of urban institutions in Djibouti. The proposed project would
help expand job prospects and improve the living conditions of the low
income dwellers of the Old Wards and Balbala. Through the adjustment of
urban policies, the project would enable the government to transfer
responsibilities to appropriate institutions and mobilize resources for the
sector. The economic rate of return of in.estments under the project is
estimated at 22%.
Risks
32.        The main risks arise from: (i) weaknesses in managerial and
technical capacity of the implementation agencies, and (ii) the poor
economic situation of the country and potential social instability, which
may delay improvements in policy reforms and cost recovery. To reduce the
first risk to acceptable levels, strong emphasis would be placed on
technical assistance and training in all urban agencies. As to the second
risk, the project would make a positive contribution to the Djiboutian
economy mainly through promotion of construction activities and employment.
