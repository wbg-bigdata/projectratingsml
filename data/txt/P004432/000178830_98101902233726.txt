REPORT AND RECOMIENDATION OF TIIE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO TtiE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR THE
TARLAC IRRIGATION SYSTEMS IMPROVEIENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for an equivalent of US$17 million to the Republic of the Philippines
to help finance an irrigation development and rehabilitation project in
Luzon. The loan would have a term of 25 years including seven years of
grace with interest at 8% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent Economic Report - "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of the Philippines" (No. 568-PH of November 7, 1974) was circulated
to the Executive Directors on November 11, 1974. Annex I contains country data.
Recent Developments
3.        In the past two years there has been a sharp increase in the level
of economic activity in the Philippines. The growth in real GNP, which had
been about 5-6% a year for more than a decade, doubled to 10% in 1973. The
strong recovery in 1973 was led by the international commodity boom and
resultant increased export incomes in the Philippines, by a strong recovery
in agricultural and industrial production for the domestic market, and by
an expansion in public and private investment. The increased domestic out-
put, and a 28% improvement in the external terms of trade, resulted in a
14% increase in gross national income in real terms in 1973 compared with
about 1% in 1972. Underemployment and unemployment remain quite high, how-
ever, and in common with most other countries, the rate of inflation in-
creased appreciably in the past 18 months. The Government has pressed ahead
with a number of important and potentially far-reaching economic and social
reforms in such areas as agrarian reform, taxation, customs administration
and tariffs, banking and government organization.
4.        The agricultural sector, which had suffered from adverse weather
conditions during the previous three years, grew by 7% in 1973. Rice pro-
duction in crop year 1973-74 increased by 23% over the level of the previous
year when floods reduced production. This increase was mainly due to
favorable weather conditions, increased use of fertilizers, more supervised
credit and increased investments in supporting rural services as part of a
general drive for rice self-sufficiency. The impact of the August 1974
floods on rice production in the present crop year appears to be moderate,
chiefly because of the short duration of the typhoons and the quick drainage
and protection provided by the rehabilitation work undertaken after the
1972 disaster. The Government has moved ahead with its programs of agrarian
reform for the nation's one million rice and corn farm tenants. By mid-1974,
176,000 land transfer certificates had been issued, mainly to tenants on
the larger holdings.



- 2 -
5.        The boom in export incomes and increased activity in agriculture
has provided the base for renewed expansion of the industrial sector which
grew by about 11% in 1973. Nontraditional industrial exports, which have
been increasing since 1970, are estimated to have doubled in 1973 to about
$200 million. The growth of industrial production for export has also been
stimulated by the Government's industrial export drive which includes a
range of export incentives. However, industrial exports have been affected
by the recent slowdown in the economies of key trading partners, and earnings
are expected to level off this year.
6.        The growth in production was also assisted by increased public
developTment outlays in 1973 made possible by a significant improvement in
the financial position of the Government. The ratio of public investmenc
to GNP is currently about 3% compared wich 1.8% in FY72.    The Government has
implemented a series of long needed tax reforms and improvements in tax ad-
ministration, such as customs and tariff reform, tax amnesties, reforms in
corporate and local taxation, continuation of the export tax, and increased
taxation on luxury items and on gasoline. These reforms, aided by the
increased economic activity, the boom in export incomes, and domestic inflation,
resulted in a 36% increase in tax revenues in FY73, and an estimated 47% in
FY74.  As a result, the ratio of national and local Government tax revenues
to GNP has increased from an average of 9% in recent years to an estimated
12.4% in FY74.
7.        High prices for the Philippines chief exports, including coconut
products, sugar, copper and wood products, were largely responsible for an
increase in merchandise receipts of almost 70% in 1973. The merchandise trade
account recorded a surplus of about $270 million, as compared with a $150 mil-
lion deficit in the previous year. International reserves rose by about
$600 million during the year and stood at $876 million, equivalent to about
five months of imports, at the end of December 1973. However, since mid-1974,
a large trade deficit has appeared, largely because the growth in export
prices has moderated while import prices have continued to rise rapidly. In
addition to the higher petroleum prices, the unit value of non-oil imports is
estimated to have increased by about 50% this year.
8.        In the latter part of 1973, inflation emerged as a major problem
in the Philippines. Since mid-1973 consumer prices have been rising at an
annual rate of more than 40%. This has been caused by the large increase in
liquidity since the export boom began in 1973, and by a number of factors,
including the higher rate of world inflation, domestic food shortages and
the increased cost of petroleum. Monetary and fiscal policies have aimed at
absorbing the excessive liquidity expansion, and in recent months the rate
of inflation has been moderating.   The authorities expect that, by the end
of the year, inflation will be down to an annual rate of about 20%. The
rapid inflation has exacerbated the decline in real wages which fell by a
total of about 25%o between 1969 and 1973. The urban wage earners have
been most affected. In the past year, agricultural and entrepreneurial
incomes have improved very substantially. THoney wages will have to be raised
in the near future if further deterioration in the living standards of wage
earners is to be avoided.



-3-
The Energy Crisis
9.        Imported petroleum provides some 97% of the Philippines' total
energy requirements. In 1973 the equivalent of 71 million barrels of petro-
leum crude and other petroleum products were imported at a cost of about
$230 million c.i.f. When the energy crisis developed late last year, it
looked as though economic activity in the Philippines would be severely
disrupted. There were temporary dislocations but the Government moved
quickly with conservation measures to reduce non-essential consumption. By
March these problems had been overcome and the Philippines is now obtaining
sufficient petroleum for its needs. In 1974 imports of petroleum and products
are likely to be about 71 million barrels at a cost of about $780 million
c.i.f.
10.       In response to the energy crisis the Government has decided to
accelerate the development of local energy sources, especially hydropower
and geothermal energy. These will be supplemented with nuclear energy in
the 1980's. The transport sector, which now accounts for 40% of total energy
consumption, is likely to continue to be the major consumer of energy. The
growth in demand for energy will therefore be influenced by the pattern of
expansion in this sector. In any event, total demand for energy is expected
to grow at about 10% a year, and even with more rapid development of natural
power sources, petroleum would still account for more than 90% of total
energy needs by 1980. The Philippines does not have any commercial oil
fields, but the Government has recently taken steps to encourage more explo-
ration.
Growth Prospects
11.       The abrupt deterioration in the external terms of trade since
the middle of 1974, and the recession in the economies of key trading
partners, together with uncertainty about how quickly they will recover, now
threatens some of the Philippines' recent economic gains. The Government
is, however, committed to maintaining the growth momentum built in the past
18 months to provide for a continued increase in incomes and employment.
The hiigh priority accorded to expanding employment opportunities - in the
short-term as well as the long-term - stems from the fact that unemployment
and underemployment are still high and the labor force continues to grow at
3% a year.
12.       Priority is being given to expanding food production for the
domestic market, to expanding export production and to accelerating develop-
ment of local energy resources. The difficulties experienced during the last
18 months in importing sufficient quantities of food at reasonable prices,
especially cereals, have increased the Government's resolve to achieve
food self-sufficiency as soon as possible. The Government rightly recognizes
that the increased cost of petroleum and other imports cannot be financed
indefinitely by borrowing abroad and it is actively encouraging both local
and foreign investors to expand the productive capacity of export industries
and to undertake major new import-replacing investments. Because it will



- 4 -
take time for these investments to have an impact on the balance of payments,
the Governm,enc is seeking increased support froni the international financial
conmunity to help carry out its development program and to ease the
adjustment to higlher petroleum and other import prices.  Because of the
substantial inprovement in the external debt burden and international
reserve position in the last 18 months, the Philippines now has the capacity
to borrow externally larger anmounts of capital in support of its develop-
ment program.
13.       Maintaining a GliP growth rate of about 7 percent a year in real
terms during the next few years will depend heavily on the buoyancy of the
domestic market. The prospects are for colitinued expansion in agriculture
withi a 4-5 percent increase in production in the year ahead. With a few
exceptions, industries are operating at relatively high levels of capacity
utilization. Increased investments will be needed in a wide range of con-
sumer and intermediate goods industries. A number of big projects are pro-
posed in mining, wood processing, fertilizer, steel and shipbuilding which
are likely to puslh up the private investment rate from recent levels of
about 16,. of CNP to perhaps 22 percent by the latter part of the decade.
The public infrastructure program that was approved last year, which called
for outlays of about P 12 billion at current prices in 1974-77, has become
outclated because of the subsequent rapid inflation and by changes in invest-
ment priorities as a result of the energy crisis.   A new program has not
been finalized, but the Governmient is putting more emphasis on developing
nuclear and indigenous power resources and on irrigation, feeder roads and
other projects to support increased food and export production.    The
Government has made considerable progress in recent years in building up
its capacity to prepare and execute projects. However, there will be a need
for continued efforts to strengthen this aspect of administration. The ratio
of public investment to GiiP is projected to rise frorm the present level of
3% to about 4% by 1977.
Balance of Payments
14.       Merchandise export receipts are projected to increase by a total of
about 30% in the next two years, with only a small increase in the unit value
of exports. import payments are projected to increase bv a total of almost
40% in the same period, including, a 30% increase in prices.  A cumulative
decline in thie e:xternal terms of trade of about 23 percent during the next
two years would probably wipe out the gains made in the recent export price
boom.  However, the outcome for the balance of payments is quite sensitive
co assumptions about external prices.   Without the projected deterioration
in the terms of trade, for example, the projected trade deficit of $1.2
billion in 1976 would be reduced by about $1 billion.
15.       The total foreign exchange requirements for meeting the current
account deficit and amortizing loans during 1975 anid 1976 would be about
S2.3 billion.  About $700 million would be provided by direct investment and
short-term trade finance and about $700 million would come from suppliers'
credits and ccmmercial commodity financing.   Disbursements of project finance



to public sector, from the present pipeline, would amount to about
$300 million. The balance of the remaining capital inflow of about $200
million in 1975 and $400 million in 1976 could be financed by the Central
Bank through short and medium-term borrowing while maintaining, or even
increasing the level of international reserves. Net reserves, however,
would be negligible by 1976. This would leave the Philippines with little
room for maneuver if the terms of trade continued to decline after 1976.
16.       The recent important gains in reducing the external debt burden
and in improving the external reserve position should not be lost now by
excessive recourse to short and medium-term borrowing abroad by the banking
system. Some assistance may be forthcoming from the IMF. In addition,
foreign donors should consider extending quick-disbursing commodity loans
with long maturities, which would make an important contribution to main-
taining growth and a manageable balance of payments position in 1975. There
is considerable scope for additional medium and long-term loans from foreign
donors to finance the much larger capital goods imports projected for 1976.
The Consultative Group is scheduled to meet again on December 9 and 10, 1974
to discuss the need for rising levels of commitments for development projects
and commodity loans to support the Philippines development program. If the
projected inflows on the capital account are forthcoming, and if the presently
identified shortfalls in foreign exchange availabilities are met with an
appropriate combination of medium and long-term loan capital as suggested,
management of the external debt and debt servicing should not present serious
problems. External medium and long-term debt outstanding would rise from
$2 billion this year to about $3 billion by 1976. The ratio of debt service
payments to exports would fall from 15 percent this year to about 13 percent
in 1976. With this moderate debt burden, the Philippines will be able to
contract substantially larger amounts of external debt which would lead to
an increase in the debt service ratio to about 16-17 percent by the latter
part of the decade. The Philippines thus remains creditworthy for substantial
Bank lending. At present, the Bank/IDA share in total debt outstanding is
about 9 percent and its share in debt service is about 5 percent. Even with
a substantially higher level of Bank lending, these shares will probably
increase only moderately in the years ahead.
17.       The Philippines development program will continue to require
resources in excess of the foreign capital which will become available for
financing the import component of development projects. Some financing of
local currency expenditures will be justified, especially for projects of
economic and social importance which need only limited amounts of foreign
exchange.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES
18.       The Philippines has received 27 Bank loans and three IDA credits
totalling $602 million, net of cancellations. About 51% of the Bank/IDA
lending, about $306 million, has been for infrastructure projects in power,



- 6 -
transportation, water supply and for education whilst $25 million has been
for population. The remainder has been divided about equally between agri-
culture and industry. About $126 million of this has been for irrigation,
livestock, rice processing and rural credit and about $145 million for
industry in four loans for the Private Development Corporation of the Philip-
pines and one loan for the Development Bank of the Philippines. There has
been a marked improvement in the way Bank financed projects in the Philip-
pines have been executed in the last two or three years compared with
experience in the 1960's when shortages of peso counterpart funds combined
with poor administration caused serious problems. All these projects are
now going reasonably well. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of September 30, 1974 and notes on
the execution of on-going projects.
19.       The size of the Bank/IDA lending program increased substantially
in FY74 reflecting the ambitious development program of the Government and
its improved capacity to prepare and implement projects.    Commitments in
FY74 amounted to $165.1 million, compared to an average of about $30 million
a year in the previous five years. It is proposed that future Bank lending
continue to concentrate on public infrastructure and agriculture. We also
pilan to continue financing industry and to provide more assistance for
projects in the social sectors.
20.       There are two additional projects which should be ready for consi-
deration by the Executive Directors later in FY75 - Rural Infrastructure
Development and Small Industry. Four projects, Population, Sixth Power and
Inter-Island Shipping and a fourth Private Development Corporation of the
Philippines project have already been approved. The Rural Infrastructure
Development project would help finance a range of rural investments designed
to promote the integrated development of the island of Mindoro. The small
industry loan would provide funds for relending to small firms and possibly
technical assistance to help strengthen the institutions serving these firms.
21.       IFC lhas made commitments in the Philippines totalling $69.2 mil-
lion for investments in eleven companies in the fields of development bank-
ing, power, teleconmunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum products,
nickel mining and refining, chemicals and synthetic fibers. Of these invest-
ments, as of September 30, 1974, $18.2 million have been sold, $0.4 million
cancelled and $2.1 million repaid, leaving a net portfolio of $48.5 million.
On the same date $13.0 million was undisbursed. Preliminary proposals have
been received for an aluminum smelter and other projects in the pulp and
paper, dinnerware, metal alloys and shipbuilding fields.

PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
22.       Agriculture is the predominant sector in the Philippine economy
generating approximately one-third of the gross national product, accounting
for one-half of total employment and about three quarters of export earnings.
Over 70% of the total land under cultivation is taken up by cereals, of which
rice and corn are the most important. The remaining land is primarily taken
up by the major export crops: sugar, coconuts, abaca, pineapples and tobacco.
23.       During the first half of the last decade, agricultural production
increased by only 2.4% a year. However, with a breakthrough in rice pro-
duction following the increased use of high-yielding varieties, fertilizers
and irrigation in the sixties, the rates of growth for rice and corn were
at about 5% and 8%, respectively, by the latter part of the decade. As men-
tioned in para 4, the sector suffered from adverse weather conditions includ-
ing severe typhoons during 1971 and 1972. These disasters slowed progress
towards self-sufficiency in food crops and annual imports of about 300,000
tons of rice were needed in 1972 and 1973. However, due to favorable weather
conditions, increased use of fertilizers, more supervised credit and in-
creased investments in supporting rural services, a harvest of 3.7 million
tons of milled rice equivalent is estimated for the crop year 1973-74.
24.       The performance of the rural-agricultural sector will be crucial
in determining whether the Philippines can increase incomes both rapidly and
equitably. At present, the domestic market for industrial products is
limited by relatively low rural incomes. Problems of poverty and income
maldistribution are particularly acute in the rural areas. Of the 15 million
people in the bottom 40% of the income scale, 12 million live in rural areas.
The Government is aware of these problems and is moving in the right direction
by stressing self-sufficiency in cereals, laying the base for future diver-
sification, undertaking agrarian reforms, and increasing institutional sup-
port to agriculture.
25.       Achieving self-sufficiency in cereals, particularly rice and corn,
is a major Government objective. For rice, moving towards self sufficiency
will depend largely on increasing yields through expansion and rehabilitation
of the area under irrigation, increased use of fertilizers and agro-chemicals
and provision of adequate credit and other supporting services. High yield-
ing varieties, which were largely responsible for the increase in production
since the late 1960's, require a much higher degree of water control than is
possible under rainfed conditions or with the typical unimproved irrigation
systems in the Philippines. At present, only about 900,000 ha or less than
30% of all land under rice cultivation is irrigated. The Philippines cannot
reach self-sufficiency in rice without substantial investment in irrigation
1/   A detailed Report entitled "Agricultural Sector Survey - Philippines"
(No. 39a-PH of May 2, 1973) was circulated to the Executive Directors
on May 21, 1973 (R73-111).



- 8 -
expansion and improvement. Investment in irrigation is therefore of high
priority and a program of irrigation rehabilitation and new construction
in rice lands involving 50,000 ha a year for the remainder of the decade
would be needed to meet domestic rice demand.
26.       Nearly half of expected Bank lending to the agricultural sector in
the next five years is likely to be for irrigation, which remains the key
to raising land productivity, to achieving and sustaining self-sufficiency
in food grains and to improving the incomes of small farmers. The proposed
project would be the third in a series of Bank-assisted projects aimed at
irrigation development and rehabilitation in Central Luzon, the largest
rice producing region in the Philippines. Of these, the Upper Pampanga River
Irrigation Project is the prototype and provides an example of the pattern
of rehabilitation, new construction and operation essential for large scale
rice production in the Philippines. Bank lending for irrigation in future
would be designed to support this approach to upgrading and improving national
irrigation systems. The National Irrigation Systems Improvement Study to be
financed by this loan would help identify and prepare future irrigation
projects.
27.       After many years of slow progress, the Government is giving high
priority to agrarian reform. The present program concentrates on rice and
corn tenant farmers, who number about one million, and includes the transfer
of titles from landlords to tenants, an expanded program of rural credit,
and increased investments in supporting rural services. In the first year
of the new program the Government has concentrated its efforts on the large
tenanted estates. By mid-1974, 176,000 certificates of title had been
issued, mainly to tenants on the larger holdings. The Government now hopes
to issue certificates to all tenants on farms above 24 ha by the end of the
year. This may be difficult to accomplish since increased resistance is
being encountered among medium scale farm owners. There is a strong prima
facie case for pressing ahead with the program in the 7-24 ha farm size range
in view of the substantial land and income redistribution effects that
would result. Implementation below this level will be extremely difficult
and benefits less obvious, in view of the numerous owners and tenants and
small parcels of land held.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.       The project is the third irrigation development and rehabilitation
project to be financed by the Bank. The project was prepared by the National
Irrigation Administration (NIA). A Bank mission appraised the project in
April/May 1974 and negotiations were held in October 1974. The leader of
the Government negotiating team was Ambassador Eduardo Z. Romualdez. The
Appraisal Report (No. 521a-PH) on the proposed project is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. Annex III provides a loan and pro-
ject summary.



- 9-
Description of the Project
29.       The project would upgrade to standards adopted in the Upper Pam-
Panga River Project, the existing Tarlac River Irrigation System, the San
Miguel-O'Donnell River Irrigation System and the Camiling River Irrigation
System and would extend these systems to include an additional 13,000 ha
of currently rainfed rice land. There would be a small increase in dry
season irrigation from about 5,000 ha at present to 6,000 ha at full project
development. The rest of the area would be under wet season irrigation.
The project would include:
(a) Rehabilitation of three existing irrigation and
drainage systems now serving a total area of
about 21,000 ha;
(b) Extension of these systems to serve an additional
area of about 13,000 ha; and
(c) Upgrading about 55 km of existing roads and con-
struction of some 370 km of new roads.
The project would also provide for a groundwater irrigation pilot scheme,
a water management training program and a National Irrigation System Improve-
ment Study (NISIS). The NISIS would inventory existing NIA systems, covering
some 400,000 ha ranging in size from 130 ha to 83,000 ha, and select a total
of about 150,000 ha with the highest priority for improvement. In this
selection, institution-building and the general poverty of the region would
be taken into account in addition to the normal economic factors. Con-
sultants would be engaged to assist the NIA with the groundwater pilot pro-
ject, the water management training program and the preparation of feasibility
reports for NISIS.
Agrarian Reform in the Project Area
30.       The project is located in the heavily tenanted region of Central
Luzon where there has been notable progress in agrarian reform. As of
December 1973, the land in the project area was owned by some 11,500 people.
The land ownership pattern in the project area reveals a considerable degree
of skewness with 95% of the landowners owning less than 7 ha each. These
holdings account for 40% of the area. On the other hand, 2% of the land-
owners with 24 ha and above owned 13,000 ha or 38% of the land. Under the
current phase of agrarian reform this land is being transferred to some 6,000
tenant cultivators. There are now 3,700 owner-operators on 8,000 ha. When
this phase is complete, 62% of the project area will be cultivated by about
9,700 owner operators, or 55% of the farmers. Until the Government reaches
a decision on what to do with small landlords (see para 27 above), it is not
possible to determine what the eventual structure of tenure would be. The
most likely outcome would be a further increase in owner operators and a better
controlled and more equitable form of lease-holding, as sharecropping has now
been declared illegal. Annual per capita incomes of farm families in the



- 10 -
project area now average around $95 and would rise to about $135 at full
project development.
Project Execution
31.       The project would be implemented by the National Irrigation Adminis-
tration (NIA) over a five-year period. NIA was established in 1964 to be
responsible for the development, operation and maintenance of all national
irrigation systems in the Philippines. NIA is a well-managed institution
which is successfully executing the Upper Pampanga River Project (UPRP) and
the Aurora-Penaranda Irrigation Project (financed by Loan 637-PH and Loan
984-PH/Credit 472-PH, respectively) through a special project office under
the direction of a Project Manager. The UPRP section of NIA would be respon-
sible for implementing the Tarlac Irrigation Systems Improvement Project.
A new Division in UPRP has already been created to carry out the construction
of the three Tarlac systems. The Project Development Division (PDD) of UPRP
would evaluate the groundwater pilot project and would be responsible for
the N4ational Irrigation Systems Improvement Study. NIA would strengthen this
Division to enable it to cope with the increased task, and would engage
consultants to provide guidance, special technical services and training to
the staff engaged in both the groundwater pilot project and National Irriga-
tion Systems Improvement Study. NIA recognizes that, due to the increased
scope of PDD's activities, its position as part of the UPRP is becoming
anomalous. As part of the ongoing reorganization of NIA the PDD's organizational
location is being reviewed and alternative arrangements are being made which
would better integrate the planning and management of foreign assisted projects
for which NIA is the executing agency. The reorganization is expected to be
completed by the end of 1975.
Cost Recovery
32.       As in the Aurora-Penaranda project, the National Irrigation Adminis-
tration would gradually increase the water rates in the project area over a
period of five years from completion of construction to a level sufficient
to cover operation and maintenance costs and to recover (without interest)
the total investment cost over not more than the 50 year life of the project
taking into account the farmers' incentives and capacity to pay. The Govern-
ment has agreed that a reasonable increase over five years would raise fees
to a level equivalent to the price of about 4.4 cavans (220 kilograms) of
paddy per ha per irrigated dry season crop and about 3.4 cavans (176 kilograms)
of paddy per ha per irrigated wet season crop (Section 4.03 (ii) of the Loan
Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
33.       The project is estimated to cost a total of US$34 million equivalent
of which US$12.7 million would be in foreign exchange. The Bank would finance
half the total project cost, that is the foreign exchange cost plus US$4.3
million of local currency requirements. The Government would finance the



- 11 -
balance of $17 million. To ensure the continuous and timely flow of funds,
the Government has agreed to set up a special fund for the project and to
replenish it at monthly intervals to a level equivalent to the estimated
total amount of payments for goods and services required for the project
during the next three months less the estimated amount of payments to be
made by the Bank to suppliers, contractors and consultants (Section 3.07 of
the Loan Agreement). The fund would ensure rapid payment of civil works
contractors which would help attract small contractors.
Procurement
34.       Equipment and vehicles for force account construction, operation,
maintenance, the groundwater pilot project, water management training and
the National Irrigation Systems Improvement Study, costing about US$3.5
million would be procured after international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with Bank Group Guidelines. A preference limited to 15% of the c.i.f.
price of imported goods or the customs duty whichever is the lower would be
extended to local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids. Procurement of
off-the shelf items costing less than US$10,000 each would be exempted from
international competitive bidding and would be purchased through normal
government procedures which are satisfactory. The total for all such items
would not exceed US$250,000.
35.       Works on the project service area (US$162.2 million) would be
scattered over a large area and include a large proportion of rehabilitation
works. These would have to be planned and executed on short notice to avoid
the growing season and bad weather, and would have to be phased with irriga-
tion releases. When similar works were advertised under the UPRP the NIA
failed to attract even local contractors. It is unrealistic, however, for
NIA to expect to undertake all of its planned construction program in UPRP,
the Aurora-Penaranda Project and the proposed project by force account. As
in the Aurora-Penaranda Project, NIA has agreed to investigate ways of expanding
the execution of civil works by contract, so that the amount of work done by
force account would not exceed 20% of the total cost of the work. The balance
would be tendered after advertising according to contracting procedures
satisfactory to the Bank (Schedule 4 paragraph 2(i) to the Loan Agreement).
Disbursements
36.       Disbursements would be made at the rate of 100% for the cif cost of
directly imported equipment, 100% for the ex-factory cost of locally manu-
factured equipment and 65% for imported equipment procured locally. For
services of foreign consultants and for overseas training, disbursements would
cover the actual foreign exchange cost, while for services of local consultants
disbursements would be at 60% of total costs. Disbursements for civil works
would be at the rate of 43% of certified monthly progress payments or expendi-
tures. For civil works contractors' mobilization and equipment, disbursements
would be at 100% of foreign exchange cost.

Economic Justification
37.       The project would contribute to the Philippine Government's objective
of attaining self-sufficiency in rice. In so doing, it would not only
strengthen the balance of payments but also help raise the incomes of the
rural population. The project would increase yields on about 34,000 ha now
dependent upon run-of-the-river irrigation and rainfed cultivation by providing
better water control, improved drainage and the necessary agricultural
supporting services. At full development, paddy yields from the wet and
dry season crops are expected to increase from 2.3 and 2.5 ton/ha to 3.8 and
4.1 ton/ha respectively. Some 18,000 farm families, averaging six members
for a total of 108,000 people, live in the project area. The average farm
unit is 1.9 ha with about 60% of the farms, covering 64% of the area, falling
between 1 and 3 ha. Taking the 2.0 ha farm as the average for the project
area, present net farm incomes of between US$505 and US$610,depending on
whether the land is rainfed or irrigated, would rise at full project develop-
ment to US$820. The increase in incomes would not do much to narrow the
income gap between the project area and other parts of the country. It would,
however, prevent the gap from widening and would set the stage for future
improvements in the relative incomes of farmers in the project area if and
when dry season irrigation water is available to serve the whole project area.
Upon completion of the project, the area cropped would increase from about
38,000 ha per year at present, of which 13,000 ha are rainfed during the wet
season, to 40,000 ha of irrigated land. Total paddy production from the
project area would be about 155,000 tons at full development, compared with
94,000 tons at present and an estimated 104,000 tons in future without the
project. The economic rate of return on the project would be about 15%.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENT AND AUTHORITY
38.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines
and the Bank, the Report and Recommendation of the Committee provided for
in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and
the text of the Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed
separately to the Executive Directors. The draft Agreement conforms to the
normal pattern for loans for irrigation projects.
39.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATION

loan.

C.   Projects in Execution -
Ln. No. 637-PH       Irrigation; US$34.0 million Loan of August 18, 1969;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
This is the first major irrigation project in the Philippines
and will supply water year-round to nearly all its 84,000 ha command area.
The project's on-farm development scheme is setting a pattern for future
irrigation development in the country. Despite some delays caused by the
1972 floods, the dam was commissioned on September 7, 1974 ahead of schedule.
All work is expected to be completed in 1975 and the loan entirely disbursed
by June 30, 1976, the Closing Date. Project costs have increased 40% over
appraisal estimates, largely as a result of rapid inflation, the effects of
successive devaluations of the peso, and design changes in the dam (which
accounted for nearly half the increase in costs). However, as a result of
the close coordination established between irrigation and agricultural
supporting services, the project is expected to reach full development in 7
years after completion of construction, instead of 13 years which was the
appraisal estimate. Also, nearly 7,000 ha have been added to the project,
mostly by including lands which were formerly under a private irrigation
system. Finally, there has been a considerable increase in the projected
world inarket price of rice. As a result, the rate of return is now more
favorable than at appraisal.
Ln. No. 720-PH       Rice Processing and Storage; US$14.3 million Loan of
February 4, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This project provides long-term credit through the Development
Bank of the Philippines to finance a program for the development and mod-
ernization of the rice and corn processing industry. Originally the project
was restricted to rice and to the private sector, and the emphasis was on
the construction of new integrated rice mills with large capacities. Due
in part to poor harvests and in part to large cost increases for rice mills,
the demand for sub-loans for new integrated rice mills turned out to be small,
and, on the basis of the President's Mtemorandum dated June 8, 1972 (R72-40)
the loan agreement was amended to shift the project emphasis to rehabilita-
tion of existing rice milling facilities. In spite of this the project made
little progress. The loan agreement was amended again in April, 1974 basically
to (i) expand the scope of the project to include corn in addition to rice,
(ii) enable local governments and the National Grains Authority to borrow
funds under the project, and (iii) streamline procurement procedures (Pres-
ident's memorandum Sec. M74-244 of April 15, 1974). As a result of these
amendments, the project is now progressing satisfactorily and the loan is
expected to be fully disbursed by the Closing Date, June 30, 1977.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 731-PH       Highway; US$8.0 million Loan of April 14, 1971;
Closing Date: May 15, 1975
The project for the construction and improvement of the Cotabato-
Digos road (160 km) in Mindanao is now behind schedule, because of civil
disturbances in the Cotabato area, exceptional rains and rapidly escalating
prices. Completion is now expected in the last quarter of 1975 compared to
June 1974 expected during appraisal. However, all principal problems have
been identified and work on resolving them is progressing satisfactorily.
The project also includes two components financed by UNDP: technical
assistance to the Bureau of Public Highways (BPH) for operational improvements
and feasibility studies for future highway projects. Work on the technical
assistance component is progressing well and the feasibility studies have
been completed.
Ln. No. 809-PH and Fifth Power; US$22.0 million and US$10.0 million Loan
Cr. No. 296-PH       and Credit of April 3, 1972; Closing Date:   June 30, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance the construction of a second thermal unit of 150-MW at Bataan and
transmission facilities in Luzon. The project is behind schedule because
procurement has taken longer than expected. The Closing Date has been
postponed from June 30, 1976 to June 30, 1978 to allow time for delayed
procurement and because retention monies will not be paid to the major equip-
ment supplier until at least one year after the plant is commissioned. NPC's
financial situation has been improved by the imposition in July 1973 of a
surcharge to cover increased fuel costs. A further tariff increase was
