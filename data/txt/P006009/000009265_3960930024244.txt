ONl A PROPOSE LOAN
TO TIM AtGENTIU REPUBLIC

AGRICULTURAL SERVICLS AND INST DIONAL 2EVEM    PRJC
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
loan to Argentina for US$33.S million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be on standard Bank terms with seventeen years' maturity, a
five-year grace period and variable interest rate, and would help to finance an
agricultural services and institutional development project. The project would
be cofinanced with the Inter-American Development Bank (1DB) and the Government
of Japan.
2.          Background.   It is well known that Argentina has a significant
comparative advantage in agricultural and agroindustrial production.   The
c_^ntry's rich soils and varied agro-climatic conditions permit the production
o3. - wide range of commodities.   This ensures self-sufficiency in most
foodstuffs, provides low-cost zaw material for a developing agroindustrial
complex, and allows the country to be a significant factor in world markets for
a number of products, especially cereals and oilseeds.
3.          Agriculture contributes about 15% to GDP and is a major contributor
to export revenues. Crops represent about 65% and livestock about 35% of sector
GDP. Agricultural products and manufactured goods of agricultural origin provide
about 7S% of total exports. Historically, however, domestic policy has been
oriented towards using the agricultural surplus to finance industrial
development. During the last decade, agriculture transferred an average of 45%
of its gross product to other sectors of the economy and to the Government. The
long-term consequence of these discriminatory policies, which have also included
export taxation and an overvalued exchange rate, has been to decapitalize the
agricultural sector. A low-cost, extensive form of agriculture has resulted,
with little capital stock or debt, and a lack of incentive to improve technology.
Of all the major agricultural producers, Argentina's agriculture is by far the
least protected and yet has continued to grow.  The implication is that with
stronger positive signals, the potential for new investment and growth is good.
In this context, recent initiatives on trade liberalization, reduction of export
taxes and freeing of the exchange rate are important steps in the direction of
creating confidence at the farm level.
4.          The Government is also currently in the midst of a public sector
reform process which aims tos reduce the size of the public sector apparatus
where approprLates establish mechanisms to reduce costs by charging the end-user
for certain services which to date have been provided free; delegate more
responsibility to provincial authorities; and increase the role of the private
sector. As part of these reform initiatives, the 8ubsecretariat of Agriculture,



-3-
Livestock and Fisheries (SSAGyP) was one of the first institutions to present its
proposal for restructuring to the Ministry of Economy (MEC). As such it is seen
as a model for other institutions. The proposal relied heavily on the guidelines
set out during preparation of this project.
5.          tationale for 8ank Involveaent. The economic and structural reforms
now under way, which are aimed at creating a more open and competitive economy,
will undoubtedly benefit agriculture, a sector which relies heavily on external
trade. Long-term sustainable growth, however, will not occur without major
Investments, even if an appropriate economic and structural framework is in
place. Years of neglect in the public sector and disinvestment by the private
sector  have  left  serious  bottlenecks  in:    (a) physical  infrastructure
(irrigation, drainage, flood control and rehabilitation of rural roads)) (b)
capital for primary production, processing and marketing; and (c) agricultural
services. The Bank's lending strategy for the sector over the next five years
will aim therefore to stimulate growth by targeting resources to each of these
areas.
6.          The proposed project addresses the third of these areas.   The
capacity of the agricultural sector to exploit its comparative advantage is
contingent on the strength of the institutions which serve it. The need for
improvement covers a wide range. Many of the problems are familiar--related to
poor funding and lack of direction. The total resources needed on an annual
basis are not particularly large, but they are fundamental to the long-term
productive and marketing potential of the sector. They deserve high priority
and, since agricultural technology is advancing rapidly on an international
level, they are particularly suitable for external financial and technical
assistance.
7.          The proposed project would be consistent with the findings of the
1989 Agricultural Sector Review which has been endorsed by the Government and the
Bank. In that review, it was stated that the principal components of a strategy
to develop agricultural services would be: (a) strengthening of animal health
and plant protection services; (b) provision of market research, varietal
development and export promotion for fruits and vegetables; (c) setting of clear
priorities for agricultural research; (d) development of a more autonomous meat
marketing board; (e) strengthening of forest management services; (f) support to
the fishing industry; and (g) increased emphasis on the control of soil erosion
and on pasture improvement.
8.          Through involvement in the preparation and appraisal o' the project,
the Bank has already had an important impact on the structure and organization
of the agencies involved, and this impact would be deepened during project
implementation. In preparation for the project, each agency had to define its
strategy, role in the sector, priorities, competence and ability to develop
effective cost recovery mechanisms. This has led to a keener awareness of skill
gaps, which have been critical constraints to the management of public sector
institutions. Great emphasis has been placed on sustainability through cost
recovery and, as a result, the fiscal impact of providing these services would
decline over the life of project. Furthermore, priority incremental staffing



4 
needs would be offset by reductions in SSAGyP's overall personnel quota through
elimination of low priority activities. The project focuses heavily on field-
level staff, given the weakness of the federal bureaucracy and the need for.
service infrastructure to become more ccm.rcially-oriented, with greater
involvement of producers and provincial agencies.
9.         fPolect Obieotives.   The project's  aim would be to  improve
Argentina I a capability to produce, certify and maintain high quality agricultural
products for export.  It woulds  (a) strengthen the effectiveness of public
sector institutions responsible for quality control services while reduclng their
dependency on budgetary allocations by charging user fees for services renderedt
and (b) diversify agrLcultural exports by strengthening support servLces, export
promotion and technical and research services through joint public and private
sector efforts.   Purthermore, lt would bulld on the ongoing Public Sector
Management Technical AssLstance Loan (Ln. 2712-AR) whlch is attempting to
strengthen the planning and policy-making function ln publlc lnstltutions,
ineluding SSAGyP. The proposed project would extend thls support to agrlcultural
servLces with an important focus on exports.
10.         Proiect Descroltion. The project would strengthen the agricultural
services managed by SSAGyP through investment ln physLcal facilitLes,
institutional development, tralning and technical assistance activities.
Specifically it would:  (a) strengthen animal disease control, primarily for
foot- and-mouth disease (PMD), brucellosis, mange and tick-borne diseases through
construction of a reference laboratory, a quarantine station and promotion of
intenslve vaccination programs; (b) strengthen phytosanitary programs to create
and maintain plant disease- and insect pest-free zones, and establlsh quarantine
and reference laboratory facilitles to certlfy levels of chemical resLdues and
phytosanitary standards in agrlcultural produce; (C) improve wool grading and
classifLcation to provide improved market transparency; (d) strengthen analysis
and monitoring of maximum sustainable fish catches; (e) promote export of higher
value-added meat products jointly with the private sector  (f) improve research
on wool, biotechnology, post-harvest physiology of fruits and vegetables, and
forest plantatlon management; (g) provlde specialized training and assistance to
strengthen technical and marketing skills ln the Meat Board and Fisheries
Institute; and (h) assist the private sector to venture into new export markets
by partly flnanclng marketing studies, technical assistance, and overseas visLts
and export promotlons.
11.         The efficiency and impact of SSAGyP's agricultural services would be
considerably improved by developing greater managerLal and flnancial autonomy for
key implementing agencies. The institutional analysis already carried out has
also identified improvements needed in admLnistration and accounting.
Furthermore, cost-recovery mechanisms whlch are to be put in place would aim to
recover up to 80% of total project costs. Specific implementing agencies would
also be responsible for debt service on their respectlve parts of the Bank and
IDB loans.



-5-
12.         The total cost of the project is estimated at US$82.7 million
equivalent (net of taxes excluding US$0.5 million to refinance PPF 119-AR which
was used to prepare the project), of which about 38% would be foreign exchange
(US$31.6 million). The Bank would finance US$33.0 million of project-related
costs (about 40% of total project costs) plus US$O.S million to refinance PPF
119-AR. The ID8 would co-finance the project (US$30.0 million, 36% of total
costs), and the Government of Japan would finance technical assistance, training
and studies in the project's forestry and fisheries subsectors (grant of USS1.0
million). Project costs and the proposed financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
13.         Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement and the proposed
disbursement schedule are shown in schedule B.  A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank-group operations on Argentina are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 9138-AR dated
January 16, 1991 is attached.
14.         Key Actions Aareed Durtina Neaoutitons:   (a) the final draft
agreement on the Export Promotion Component was agreed; (b) all agencies
presented revised draft Statements of Policy outlining their strategy for future
development which will become integral parts of subsidiary agreementsl and (c)
key indicators of performance were agreed as part of the Loan Agreement.
15.         Conditions of Effectiveness and Disbursement.  For effectiveness of
the loans (a) the project coordinating unit would be established and staffed;
(b) the Export Promotion Component documents would be signed, the Export
Promotion Fund would be established, and the Executive and Technical Directors
hired; (c) the IDB loan has been approved; and (d) SSAGyP would have signed
subsidiary agreements with autonomous agencies and the National Meat Board would
have adopted a Statement of Policy satisfactory to the Bank. As key conditions
of disbursement of the respective componentes  (i) cost-recovery mechanisms,
including tariffs to be charged, and 8ank-approved cost accounting procedures
would be put in place; (ii) establishment and staffing of the project component
management units would be completed; and (iii) tender documents for all first-
year contracts (by component) would be prepared.
16.         Benefits.  Project benefits would be derived from:  (a) improved
services provided by participating institutions; (b) increased quality and
quantity of product available for export by the private sector; and (c) greater
export diversification. The overall strengthening of key SSAGyP services would
contribute to maintaining Argentina's comparative advantage as an agricultural
producer. A stronger SSAGyP would also be in a better position to help formulate
sound public policies.
17.          An economic rate of return has not been calculated since precise
quantitative estimates of benefits are difficult to make in an institutional
development project.   However, animal disease control campaigns would bring
direct benefits in terms of reduced losses, improved productivity and increased
access to export markets. The impact of phytosanitary control is especially



-6-
difficult to estimate, since statistics on potential losses due to crop pests
and/or rejected products (pesticide contamination) are not available in
Argentina. The magnitude of the potential problem can, however, be estimated on
the basis of experiences elsewhere.  ror examples  (a) the potential direct
losses from the Introduction of fruit fly to the Rio Negro valley (70,000 ha of
apples and pears) would be about US$30 million per year in direct losseat. and (b)
the introduction of cotton weevil into northeastern Argentina would increase
pesticide costs by raising the number of applications from three to about eight
per growing cycle.   In addition,  yields could decline by about 30%, as
demonstrated when the weevil appeared irs previously uninfested areas of Brazil.
18.         Without the project,  Argentina would Incur serious  losses in
agricultural export markets. Failure to comply with the increasingly strict
requirements of most importing countries on pesticides and other residues would
have a strong negative impact on exports. In addition, phytosanitary standards
in the European Community (SC) will become even stricter after 1992 when Spanish
regulations banning fresh fruit imports from regions with fruit fly or citrus
canker become the standard for the entire EC. The opening of markets in Eastern
Europe could also be threatened if SC standards are adopted throughout Europe.
Regarding meat exports, as the EC moves towards eradication of FMD, Argentina
will have to move towards FMD-free status.   The objective during project
implementation would be to create gradually certified FMD-free zones within
Argentina, with the longer term objective of total eradication. As regards wool,
the International Wool Secretariat establishes the industry certification
standard and, unless Argentina can meet this standard, its wool will continue to
fetch low prices in world markets.
19.         Risks. In addition to Argentina' general macroeconomic uncertainty,
the most important risks could stem from the availability of counterpart funds,
the level of managerial capacity and the low level of commitment by public
servants due to low salaries. The local funding risks, which affect all proposed
Bank investment operations in Argentina, would be mitigated to a large extent by
the project's proposed cost recovery mechanisms. The lack of managerial capacity
in public institutions w'ould be mitigated by the project's strongly focussed
institutional strengthening programs. The issue of inadequate compensation in
the public sector is being tackled by Government through public sector reform
measures which would also be assisted by the Bank in a proposed new loan. Since
project design encourages financial autonomy, this should also provide means to
support competitive staff salaries over time.
20.         Environment. The project would have a positive environmental impact.
The animal health and phytosanitary components would provide mechanism to
control disease, pests and levels of chemical residues in all foodstuffs, not
only those for export. The fisheries component would prevent over-exploitation
of maritime resources.

21.         R*gg   c^stion. I am satisf ed that tho proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
