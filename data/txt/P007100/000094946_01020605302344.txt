3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective.
According to the SAR' the project would: (a) reduce the risk of rural and urban flooding and
resultant losses to life, property and output in the Lower Guayas Basin2; (b) improve health
and living conditions through flood control and drainage; (c) increase the productive capacity
of the Region; (d) enhance the capacity of central and local organizations; (e) protect and
conserve the natural environment in the Lower Guayas Basin (800,000 ha), including the El
Churute Reserve and part of the Upper Basin (409,000); and (f) delineate a sound development
strategy for the area's natural and human resources through a Master Development Plan for the
entire Lower Guayas Basin and for its selected upper catchment areas. Objectives were clear,
realistic and relevant since the Lower Guayas basin is one of the country's most important
agricultural production areas with more than 188,800 rural and urban people and with high
potential for increasing employment and foreign exchange earnings. It also met concerns
raised in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA); designed a strong technical assistance
component (20% of project costs) to strengthen the institutions involved in the
implementation; and an Agricultural Development Plan (ADP) to increase the social and
productive potential of small farmers.
3.2 Revised Objective. During implementation, the objectives remained unchanged.
3.3 Originail Components.
The project was well conceived as the first phase of a broader plan for the development of
water, soil and human resources in the Lower Guayas Basin, providing flood control and
drainage for a priority area of about 170,000 hectares. The project comprised the following
four components:
(i) Infrastructure: consisting of dikes, three bypass (flood relief) channels, main and
secondary drainage systems, rural roads, bridges and various water control and conveyance
structures (US$51.9 million);
(ii) Agricultural Development Plan (ADP), aimed at supporting and improving 3,300
smallholder (<10 ha) production systems (US$16.3 million);
(iii) Environmental protection and conservation initiatives (US$5.8 million); and
(iv) Institutional Strengthening (US$3.4 million). Including US$20.1 million of price and
physical contingencies, total costs would reach US$97.5 million. A breakdown including
contingencies for each component is shown below.
' Staff Appraisal Report No. 8792, dated November 13, 1990.
2 The project's flood control system would benefit the 188,800 urban and rural inhabitants of the 170,000 ha
project area through protection from up to 1:50 year frequency (i.e., catastrophic) flooding. In any given year, an
average of 36,400 people would be protected against major flooding.

3.4 Revised Components:
There was no change in the original components. However, there was a "de facto" adjustment
in budget and target of the ADP. Co-financed by the Government of the Netherlands (GON,
US$7 million) the ADP was supposed to include as sub-components: (a) an adaptive research
program in rice, cacao, alternative crops, water management, integrated pest management and
small scale mechanization; (b) seed production; (c) extension through the Ministry of
Agriculture (MAG's) agencies; and (d) strengthening smallholder farm organizations. After
the first three years of project implementation, so little progress was made on this component,
that the GON withdrew its financing, judging that the Government of Ecuador (GOE) no
longer supported this objective. In the end only about 11% of this component was completed,
due to lack of counterpart funds from GOE.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The Commission for the Development of the Guayas Basin (CEDEGE) was responsible for
project implementation, and with the support of an international firm of engineering
consultants, completed the project design and preparation in March 1990. A different
international firn of consulting engineers was awarded the contract for supervision of works.
According to several early reports by the supervising engineers, the project civil works, based
on three diversion canals (three by-pass), and rehabilitation of existing canals system was well
conceived. However, basic assumptions underlying the design did not prove adequate to the
technical characteristics3 of the project area. The base line information was either out dated
and did not correspond to reality or did not consider in detail crucial aspects such as
geomorphology, geo-techniques and soil use. As a result detailed designs of some important
infrastructure proved inadequate after bid award, so redesign was carried out during
implementation. This was an important cause for the rise in the cost of civil works from
US$66.8 million to about US$135 million, a rise of 102.8% over the original estimate.

de los caudales de desvio es de cauces aluviales tipicos de planicie, en condiciones de madurez y equilibrio
morfol6gico relativo", cuando en realidad se trata de "un cono de deyecci6n que es por su propia naturaleza y
dinamica general una geoforma en estado de permanente desequilibrio morfol6gico hacia la depositaci6n".
Technical Report prepared by the supervising engineers, November 1998.

The project design correctly followed the Bank's safeguard policies. Project design included:
(a) the ADP to upgrade small farmers, so they could more fully benefit from the project; (b) a
series of activities to implement the recommendations of the EIA; and (c) a program to
strengthen CEDEGE's capacity to administer the project. Special covenents (for the first time)
in the Loan Agreement (LA) ensured that the Bank's procurement rules took precedence over
new, related laws in Ecuador.
CEDEGE was an engineering-oriented agency with little experience and narrow mandate in
social and agricultural matters. The Bank was proven wrong to assume that CEDEGE was
likely to have interest and capacity to pursue aggressively poverty alleviation and agricultural
development objectives.
With hindsight it is clear that the design omitted several key conditionalities. The SAR
recognized the importance of having land expropriated before construction began, but had no
meaningful conditionality in the LA to achieve it. Likewise the SAR recognized the
importance of cost recovery to make the project sustainable, but had no workable solution to
achieve it. There was only the agreement that CEDEGE would manage maintenance activities
and the GOE would finance it. To do the latter GOE agreed to increase appraised land values
for tax purposes. This approach of GOE and CEDEGE taking responsibility for maintenance
proved unrealistic under the circumstances.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4. 1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Project outcome is considered satisfactory. Most of the relevant objectives of the project have
provided good results in its physical, environmental, financial and economic development
targets. The flood control and drainage infrastructure worked effectively during the last three
severe winters, successfully protecting the area from 50% higher water volumes than foreseen
during appraisal. In spite of huge cost overruns, the infrastructure has generated remarkable
economic benefits in avoiding losses in urban and agricultural production investments mainly
during the 1997/98 "El Nifno" phenomenon. Severe damage in the system could be clearly
observed due to the record high flooding during El Nino and the absence of maintenance
during the construction phase and thereafter. The delay in the formation of the user's
organization and beneficiaries taking over responsibility for maintenance, raised some early
concern about future sustainability of the infrastructure, but this now seems well towards
solution. Less than expected achievements were attained on development in the small farmer
sector and in some of the environmental planning objectives.
The project is already generating a variety of benefits including higher agricultural production
and productivity, increased incomes, improved health and sanitation conditions, higher
government savings and revenues, and enhanced environmental quality of areas both inside
and outside the project boundaries.  Before the project, agricultural development was
constrained by the risk from flooding and losses. The reduced risk associated with controlled
flooding and improved drainage strongly stimulated production investments and technology
improvements. However, most of the above mentioned benefits are attributable to the larger
commercial farms sector with a favorable financial position, while the small scale, low-income
4



farmers lacked the ADP support necessary to help them to take advantage of the security
afforded by the flood protection.
4.2 Outputs by components:
lnfrastructure: Works were foreseen to provide flood control for a highly flood prone areas of
about 170,000 ha, including one urban and seven semi-urban settlements. Additionally, the
construction of new and improvement of existing drainage enhanced production conditions for
adjacent areas. During 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99 winters, river flows exceeded by
several times the design flows and the new system responded adequately. Physically, about 85
% of the civil works have been completed, however, some minor drainage canals and small
flood protection structures still remain unfinished. Even though the system is operating well,
some more structural work is needed to secure the system against possible future failures.
Agricultural Development: Due to the reduced production risks associated with the flood
control and improved drainage works, agricultural production has grown more than three times
the growth estimates made at appraisal. The losses prevented in 1997/98 are equivalent to
about 70% of the value of the investment made through this project. Since 1996, about 20,000
hectares of new agricultural area has been added to farmland with an estimated private
investment value of about US$60 million.  The ADP was conceived to support the
incorporation of the small farmers' sector (85% of farmers) in the development process. In
spite of some valuable training activities and isolated pilot experiences held in some small
rural communities, the project failed to provide the expected support to small farmers whose
limited resources preclude them from fully benefiting from flood-free conditions. Never the
less the market value of small farmers' land has increased ten times. Since 80% of the project
rural area is held by large farmers, (including 53% occupied by farms larger than 1,000
hectares) and since the ADP was only 20% implemented, almost all the increased production
came from the commercial farms.
Environment Protection. Substantial progress has been made towards some of the project
environmental objectives. These are: (i) selection of flood control structures and design
alternatives aimed at minimizing adverse environmental impacts; (ii) development of
management plans for "El Churute" Reserve; and (iii) strengthening CEDEGE's institutional
capacity to carry out environmental protection measures and enforce regulations more
effectively. Most of the works have been built under a close environmental audit contracted
with a respected NGO, improving the design of critical structures during the construction
period. The design of simulation models together with the installation of laboratory facilities
and the capacity building process will be useful for the future environment and flood control
structure protection. Preparation of the Environmental Plan for Development of the lower
watershed of the Guayas River Basin was delayed. Contracting of the study is almost
complete, and will be financed separately by CAF.
Institutional Strengthening. CEDEGE improved its management and implementation capacity
and strengthened its staff's professional skills in several areas, particularly in finance and
administration. A computer network with financial and project management software was
installed to integrate the central office with its several project units. A small environmental
monitoring group has been established in CEDEGE with a laboratory. Programs for
agricultural development capacity building, and intra and inter-institutional coordination to
5



provide orientation and support towards the efficient and sustainable use of natural resources
for poverty alleviation was not developed.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of relurn:
The overall Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for the project was estimated by the SAR at 15%
over 40 years, the expected life of major investments. New detailed recalculations were done
as of the project closing date, quantifying the effects of the three years in which the system has
operated and the expected production response to the improved production environment.
Within the project area about 20,000 new ha are under agricultural production, increasing the
cropped area from 90,000 to 110,000. Increases include 6,000 under sugarcane, 5,000 with
rice, 4,000 with banana plantations, 3,000 with cacao and 2,000 under maize and other grain
crops. The analysis was based on crop budgets and the actual area changes in the last five
years, considering border prices for the principal products and market prices for the production
costs, since they reflect adequately their opportunity cost and/or border prices. It was assumed
that O&M of the system would be adequately performned in the future and that the value of
avoided losses during the 1997/98 El Nifto phenomenon was US$100 million. The new
estimate of the ERR under the mentioned assumptions is 18.6% and the NPV US$33.5 million
(see Table in Annex 3). However, if the 1997/98 avoided losses would be valued at US$50
million, the ERR would drop to 13.8% and the NPV to US$10.9 million. This leads to the
conclusion that the avoided losses in the first year of project operation almost justified 70% of
the investment costs. Additionally the project contributed considerably to: (i) improve the
living conditions in the area, including the public health and sanitation conditions; (ii)
increasing government savings from emergency works and revenues from increased economic
activities; and (iii) enhancing the environmental quality of the region.
4.4 Financial rate of return.
Land value changes constitute a good proxy market indicator of the expected financial returns
from project investments. Land value has increased from an average of US$500 per hectares
before the operation of the flood control system to US$5,000. This means that the 145,000
hectares under agricultural production would have an incremental aggregate market value of
about US$650 million, 4.6 times the project's invested amount. Agricultural production has
grown from an annual value of US$145 million to about US$200 million today and would
reach almost US$230 million in two or three more years as new plantations reach full
production. These numbers are the combined result from considerable private expectations
and investments induced by the project protection infrastructure and are based on the actual
and expected financial profits to be obtained by farmers in the project area. About 34% of the
145,000 hectares has under agricultural production in the flood controlled area is already under
sugarcane production, 13% under rice production, 8% with banana plantations and an
additional 20% with cacao and other crops. The remaining 25% of the area is under natural
and improved pastures.
4.5 Institutional Development Impact:
Despite staff losses and budget cuts from the Government's austerity programs, the
professional quality of the different CEDEGE services has improved and the project
accounting system is used by CEDEGE for all its investment projects. The institution's
6



commitment to developing efficient and sustainable use of the regions' strategic natural
resources, and actively contributing to poverty alleviation is not so clear. Recent advances in
forming the users group to take responsibility for maintenance of the system is a very
important contribution to the long term sustainability of the system.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The historically severe El Nino phenomenon in 1998-99, forced CEDEGE to speed up
construction, resulting in increased project costs. In addition, during the past three winters the
system has operated with the occurrence of severe and continuous water flows exceeding by
more than 50% the design parameters, thus damaging part of the system and adding cost to
ongoing works.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Most of the period covering implementation of this project was characterized by political and
economic instability. Between effectiveness and project completion there were six GOE
administrations, and only the first two finished their constitutional term. Poor macro-
economic policies, which ultimately resulted in government insolvency, negatively impacted
government counterpart contributions to the project.
5.3 Factors generally subject lo implementing agency control:
Recognizing the project complexity and the difficulties derived from severe winters,
implementation of works still could have been completed up to two years sooner. A one year
postponement of the Closing Date was granted. Delays were due primarily to: (a) poor quality
of original designs, which required re-design during construction; (b) inability to resolve
expropriation disputes with land holders in a timely fashion; (c) in one case poor
environmental planning which justified halting works for one by-pass, until there was re-
mediation; and (d) inadequacy of some heavy machinery and equipment proposed by
contractors and accepted by CEDEGE.
In 1995 the Government of Netherlands terninated its co-financing of the project because it
considered that CEDEGE was not sufficiently committed to the development of the ADP
component, which was three years behind schedule. During implementation there was no real
commitment and capacity from CEDEGE to assist the poorer farmers as was agreed during the
appraisal.  The subsidiary agreements with MAG's various specialized agencies and
institutions failed to help the 3,270 small farmers to develop better production, crop
diversification & intensity and expanded investment. In addition the low level of counterpart
funds resulted in continuous reductions of activities planned for small farmers. CEDEGE gave
the priority to infrastructure investments rather than rural development.
5.4 Costs and financing:
Total project costs reached US$140 million, or 144% of the SAR estimate (US$97.5 million).
Cost overruns were primarily resulted from redesign of the flood control and drainage
7



components. These were budgeted to cost about US$66.8 million, but reached more than
US$135 million, 203% of the original estimate. The main reasons for these increases are
outlined in paragraph 5.3 above. By expenditure categories, freight costs represent about 60%
of all civil work costs. Design changes called for such quantities of rock and clay to stabilize
dikes that sources at much greater distances were necessary. Other categories included:
excavations 12%, concrete and reinforcements, 10%; fillings (without transportation) 4%;
siphons 3%; and other costs 11%.
Bank's financial contribution was almost US$59 million (100% of the planned amount) and of
the expected US$7 million to be covered by the GON grant, mainly for the ADP and
environmental components, only US$0.2 million was disbursed. From the expected GOE
contribution of US$20 million, only US$12 million was made available. Additionally, CAF
financed US$12 million and COPEFEN (Loan 4259-EC) US$10 million, both sources not
foreseen at appraisal. There is an unpaid balance of about US$45.7 million owed to the two
international contractors building the system, still without clear financing.
6. Sustainability
6.1   Rationale for sustainability rating:
Project sustainability is rated likely. The flood control system has already been successfully
tested against the extreme conditions of a 100 year flood. There is a backlog of uncompleted
maintenance, but the GOE is unlikely to be able to meet its obligation in the LA to finance this
work. The landowner beneficiaries are the stakeholders with the strongest interests in
sustaining their benefits from the Project, and CEDEGE is completing the transfer of
maintenance responsibilities to this group. Accordingly they have legally established their
users group, which has a balanced representation of the different and sometimes conflicting
interests in the area, including sugar factories, banana growers, sugarcane growers,
municipalities, the Air Force Base, and small producers. The group has acquired office space
and hired a highly qualified general manager. CEDEGE has also agreed with the group on an
action plan of immediate work to be carried out at the group's expense. The group intends to
formalize self financing for its future with a tariff on the amount of land owned by members.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
CEDEGE with the help of engineering consultants provided by COPEFEN (El Nino
Emergency Recovery Project) has prepared an Action Plan which prioritizes activities into
short term maintenance actions and longer term investments to improve the system's
efficiency. The users group has begun to implement priority maintenance. Although the ADP
activities lost their financing and were terminated under the Project, the Irrigation TA Project
(Loan 3730-EC) is financing on-farm development work with some small farmer groups
located in irrigation systems transferred to users in the flood control area.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
The Bank's performance in identification was satisfactory. The project was consistent with the
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Ecuador and had strong support from GOE. On
balance the Bank's performance in preparation and appraisal was rated unsatisfactory.
Although the original design concept was sound, several important design assumptions were
flawed. This caused the design to be changed during construction and was a primary reason
for the huge cost overruns. No workable arrangements were made to recover the costs of
maintenance from beneficiaries, as a condition for making the investment. In this respect,
beneficiaries should have been given a more relevant role in the project preparation and design
in order to improve the relevance of the infrastructure and to assure their support for
expropriation and maintenance. The Bank should have had a more realistic view of the
difficulties of expropriation, with LA conditionality to assure that it was accomplished before
major contract awards. With the exception of social outreach and participation, the Bank's
Safeguard Policies were followed satisfactorily. The Bank's overall performance in lending is
Unsatisfactory.
7.2 Supervision:
The Bank supported the implementation phase through 20 supervision missions including a
mid-term evaluation in June 1995 and an economic evaluation in October 1998. Missions
often included an environmental specialist to monitor performance and maintain contacts with
the NGO community. The Bank was flexible and supportive under the changing conditions
and extreme political and economic instability prevailing during most of the implementation.
But it should not have agreed to CEDEGE awarding key works contracts, until after related
land expropriations were completed. In addition, the Bank supervision team should have been
more assertive in alerting management of the declining commitment of the government.
The Bank was strong in recommending that a users group be created to take over this
responsibility for maintenance, with extension of the Closing Date conditional on progress in
this respect. It also helped to arrange co-financing for cost over-runs. It could have been more
proactive in the restructuring of the ADP in order to find viable alternatives after the GON
grant was cancelled.
The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) completed a Rapid Quality of Supervision Assessment
in 1998 and judged overall quality of supervision at that time to be marginal. Its primary
concern was that stronger supervision efforts might have convinced the GOE to finance
delayed maintenance. The supervision team felt that handing over this responsibility to a users
group would be a more sustainable solution in the long run. The prospect of continuing GOE
maintenance would likely remove this incentive to form the group.
7.3 Overall Bank performance: Overall Bank performance is considered satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation.
During preparation the borrower's performance was unsatisfactory. In spite of many years and
substantial resources spent in preparation, the infrastructure design proved deficient in
important respects noted above. The Borrower only superficially addressed key issues of
participation, expropriation and sustainability during preparation.  On the other hand its
handling of environmental studies and management capacity were satisfactory.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Borrower's performance during implementation was also unsatisfactory. During the economic
austerity of the 1990s the GOE had to down size its agencies and redirect services to its
highest priorities. In this environment CEDEGE's institutional capacity to carry out the non
engineering components of the project were severely handicapped. When the GON cancelled
its grant financing the ADP, GOE failed to maintain the needed commitment towards the small
farmer sector. Finally when maintenance of the works were necessary, GOE would not assign
a priority to it for financing.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
CEDEGE's performance was also unsatisfactory. Its management of the major construction
contracts was weak, allowing long costly delays, which could have been avoided with better
planning and administration.  In some cases contractors were allowed to substitute less
efficient equipment, causing delays. The implementing agency also failed in adequately
promoting the participation of beneficiaries in the planning, design, construction and
maintenance phases. In general its communications with  stakeholders, particularly
beneficiaries was weak and often ineffectual. In the case of expropriations, this led to
contentious disagreements that ended in costly delays in project implementation. CEDEGE
also delayed preparation of the Master Plan for the Development of the Guayas Basin.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
In total the Borrower's (GOE and CEDEGE) performance was unsatisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
@ Project beneficiaries ownership should be confirmed from the early stages, through
involvement in preparation work and throughout the project cycle in order to assure
effective implementation and sustainability.
+ Project appraisal of a civil works project should be delayed until at least 25% of the final
design is ready for bidding.
10



q When land expropriation is a key element in project timing, it must be completed before
award of associated works contract.
k Any operation and maintenance agreement with a user group should be finalized, as a
condition for making the investment

De mis consideraciones:
Observaciones al inforrne de cierre del Proyecto Control de Inundaciones de la
Cuenca Baja del Rio Guayas preparado por el Banco Mundial
1) Numeral 3.4, retiro de los fondos del gobierno de Holanda
1. I Para un proyecto de control de inundaciones de 9 afos de duracion no es posible
inmediatamente iniciar las actividades de desarrollo agropecuario. El objetivo
principal, que es evitar que las tierras se inunden, tiene que ser primero
alcanzado para luego. con la seguridad de poder trabajar la tierra, se puedan
realizar labores en pro del desarrollo agropecuario.
1.2 El retiro del Gobierno de Hlolanda fue debido a cambios que el gobierno del
Ecuador introdujo en la forrna de implecmntaci6n dcl plan, como es el caso de
formar pequefios empresarios, contraria a la corriente filos6fica-politica del
gobierno de Holanda
1.3 Extraoficialmente los funcionarios del G. H. informaron a CEDEGE que
realmente no habian encontrado pobreza cxirema en el sector de la Cuenca Baja
y que sus recursos principalntente atendian ese tipo de situaciones.
2) Numeral 4.1.- Los volfimenes de agua fueron 500%0 mas altos de los esperados.
Realmente fueron del orden del 125%, habiendo las obras resistido a pesar de
estas situaciones adversas extremas.
3) Numeral 4. 1.- Demoras en la organizacion de los usuarios, y que aquello levanto
desde el principio preocupaci6n por parte del Banco.- En el SAR nunca se
consider6 la administraci6n por cuenta de los usuarios. sino que se preveia que
CEDEGE organice una Unidad de Operaci6n y Mantenimiento. Posteriormente
el gobierno ecuatoriano y CEDEGE toman la decision de transferir la obra a los
usuarios y asi se la cosnunican al Banco, quien lo adopta como politica del
proyecto y presiona a CEDEGE para que proceda a la organizaci6n de los
ILsuarios lo mis nipidarnente posible. El Banco ha considerado que CEDEGE
no agilizo el proceso de entrega a los usuarios, dejindolo clararnente establecido
en diferentes Ayudas Memorias.

La posici6n de CEDEGE siempre ha sido contrana a esta apreciaci6n, indicando
que nos encontribarnos en plena etapa de El Nifro y luego que no era el
momento oportuno por cuanto las obras no estaban finalizada. Los primeros
rC7'=G-~ d(as del atlo 2000 se realizari la transferencia formaI a los usuarios, los cuales
reaccionaron adecuadamente cuando CIDEGE, con rnas conocimi¢nto de la
q       idiosincrasia de los usuarios que los personeros del Banco Mundial que nos han
visitado, detcrmin6 que era el momnato oportuno.
4) En el numeral 4.2, "Infraestructura". de dice que el 85% de las obras civiles
estin terminadas. Consideramos qua airededor del 95% estin terminadas.
5) En el numeral 5.3, el literal d) del primer parrafo no es correcto. En ning4n
momento CEVEGE accpt6 por paste de los contratistas maquwnaria pesada
inadecuada, de otra mancra la obra no hubiera tenido la calidad que tiene en la
actualidad. Estas observaciones que por primera vez las vemos, nunca han
figurado en las Ayudas Memorias que el Banco ha elaborado.
En of numeral 7.6 se considera a CEDEGE corno no satisfactorio en su
desempefo, cuando en muchas partes de este informe se habla de las bondades
del proyecto. Se dice especificamente que la adninistraci6n de los contratos fue
dabil. cuando esti'demostrado que las obras han soportado las condicioncs mas
adversas: 125% ma,s que el diseflo, y esto no podia haberse dado si hubiera
existido una debil administraci6n del contrato. No cs exacto que se haya
pernmitido la sustituciOn por equipo menos eficiente, ocasionando con eWto
demoras. Las demnoras fueron ocasionadas por problemas de expropiaciOn de
tierras, problemas de financiamiento y aportes por pare del gobierno
ecuatoriano, y paralizaciones ordenadas por el propio Banco Mundial por
soluciones de orden ecol6gico qua mostraron. una vez realizadas, no haber sido
prfcticas, ya quc los dahlos a la ecologia registrados al final han sido de igual
ffagitud de los que se suponia ocurrirlan en los dise?Sos originales.
Por todos cstos motivos, no estamos de acucrdo en que se considere a CEDEGE
como no satisfactorio en su desempefro, rnas bien estamos convencidos que cl
desempefio de CEDEGE ha sido satisfactoric a poear de todas las vicisitudes y
problemas quo hemos tenido en un proyecto de tan larga duraci6n, como jamis se
haya implernentado en este pals.

INFORME FINAL DEL PRESTATARIO
Este "resumen Ejecutivo" se basa en el INFORME DE CIERRE DE PROYECTO, solicitado por el
BIRF a CEDEGE, que compendia el proceso de ejecuci6n del Proyecto hasta Junio del afno 2.000. El
Contrato de Prestamo BIRF 3276-EC, por $USD 59,0 millones, se suscribi6 en marzo de 1.991 y se
ejecutara at 100%; mientras el Convenio de donaci6n del Gobiemo de Holanda (GOH), por $USD 7
millones, se firm6 en septiembre de ese mismo afno, pero fue retirado en 1.995 con un uso menor al 3%.
El marco de referencia de este Informe es el "Staff Appraisal Report" del BIRF, N° 8792 - EC, de
Noviembre 13 de 1.990, al que se denominara SAR.

(1) Inversi6n total a Junio /2.000
El incremento se explica por: 1) ser una obra compleja y geograficamente extensa; 2) la ejecuci6n en el
lapso de ocho afios: 1.993-2.000; 3) las condiciones meteorol6gicas adversas; 4) los cambios en los
disenos iniciales; 5) la insuficiencia, en la zona, de los materiales de construcci6n, que obligaron a
sobre - acarreos; 6) la baja de participaci6n de los beneficiarios; 7) las dificultades para la obtenci6n de
los aportes del Gobierno y los financiamientos complementarios; 8) el predominio de las obras civiles
sobre los componentes sociales; y 9) la crisis econ6mica y financiera nacional.
DISENOS
El antecedente del Proyecto es el disefio de factibilidad elaborado para el ex - INERHI, en catorce
meses, por la Consultora Haskoning bajo la modalidad de Cooperaci6n tecnica no reembolsable del
Gobierno de Holanda (GOH). Consultora que fue contratada posteriormente para los disefios
definitivos. En Noviembre de 1.988 el Gobierno del Ecuador (GOE) nomina a CEDEGE para que
ejecute el Proyecto que, con el apoyo tecnico de la Consultora, completa la preparaci6n de la solicitud
de prestamo hasta Mayo de 1.990. Entre Octubre de 1.987 y enero de 1.990 el BIRF realiz6 el
monitoreo del trabajo mediante ocho Misiones. Y finalmente, el Proyecto fue evaluado por el BIRF en
Marzo de 1.990 con la participaci6n del Gobierno de Holanda (GOH).
De otra parte, aunque en el SAR se otorg6 primera prioridad a la ejecuci6n del Programa de Desarrollo
Agricola (PDA), asignando mas del 20% del presupuesto de la inversi6n total, este se bas6 en la
donaci6n del GOH que retir6 su aporte en 1.995 y dej6 sin financiamiento a uno de los objetivos
23



centrales del Proyecto que era el incremento de los ingresos de los pequenios agricultores. Los objetivos
del SAR. aceptados por CEDEGE, en cuanto a Desarrollo Agricola y otros componentes sociales son
plausibles, sin embargo, debe reconocerse que la propuesta de lograr cambios estructurales a traves de
un Proyecto concreto es un paradigma que requiere ser superado.
El Sistema construido ha demostrado gran capacidad para aumentar la producci6n y la riqueza de la
Zona; y la Inversi6n result6 rentable porque fue realizada en una zona altamente productiva y dinamica,
y aunque los beneficios se han concentrado en las empresas de mayor tamafno y tecnologia, esta debe
ser la base para garantizar su 6ptimo aprovechamiento futuro, a condici6n de acertar tambien con la
Organizaci6n eficaz de la Operaci6n y Mantenimiento. Terninadas las obras, todo el sistema principal
y secundario de drenaje y control de inundaciones y diques para varios usuarios deberia ser mantenido
por CEDEGE, de acuerdo con regulaciones establecidas durante el primer afno de ejecutado el
Proyecto. Los canales terciarios, por un Comite de agua. Esta propuesta no era discutible al momento
de elaborar el SAR, pero fue revisada posteriormente.
EJECUCION
Obras fisicas. La obra fue construida mediante un proceso de mejoramiento del disefno y a mayor costo
en comparaci6n con el presupuesto del SAR, sin embargo, en la actualidad tiene un retorno econ6mico
y social altamente positivo que es reconocido y certificado por los productores, habitantes y entidades
civiles y militares. Las construcciones de las obras se iniciaron en 1.993 para el Grupo A, y en 1.995
para el Grupo B; luego se incorporaron las obras de los Grupos C y D, asignadas mediante contratos a
dos empresas constructoras que ganaron las Licitaciones Internacionales convocadas por CEDEGE. A
finales de 1.992 se realiz6 el primer pago de los anticipos a la Empresa constructora del Grupo A de
obras, y el proceso constructivo se extendera hasta finales del 2.000, es decir 8 afios a partir de 1.993.
En el SAR se habia programado para 7 afios a partir de 1.991. La valoraci6n de la Obra fisica
ejecutada hasta Diciembre/2.000 sera de $USD 135,56 millones; es decir, el doble de lo presupuestado
en el SAR.

Para finales de 1.995, la diferencia entre lo ejecutado y lo programado llego a - 60%; sin embargo, en
1.997 se ejecut6 el 39% de la obra y la diferencia disminuy6 hasta el - 20%; es decir que para finales
de ese afno se habia cumplido el 80% de la obra fisica programada en el SAR. Los factores que, en
mayor grado, contribuyeron a la elevaci6n de los costos de la inversi6n estan en relaci6n a la forna con
la que se ejecutaron las siguientes actividades: (i) modificaciones en los disenlos; (ii) demoras en las
expropiaciones y oposici6n de algunos agricultores; (iii) sobre acarreo de materiales y aumento de la
cantidad de obras.

La Misi6n del BIRF, en julio de 1.994, incorpora el informe de la Fiscalizaci6n y propone los
siguientes criterios para la evaluaci6n de disefios y obras: "Grupo A, revisi6n general del Plan
hidraulico y la adecuaci6n de las obras; Grupo B, verificar los criterios usados en el diseino de todas las
obras hidraulicas, en caso necesario hacer modificaciones y recomendar soluciones, establecer si se han
omitido obras importantes y verificar si las obras diseniadas corresponden a las necesidades locales;
Grupo C y D, verificar principios de disefno y revisi6n general del plan propuesto". En noviembre de
1.994, la Misi6n del BIRF solicit6 a CEDEGE la suspensi6n temporal de la construcci6n de la descarga
del By Pass 3, debido a la tala y quema de manglares, y recomend6 a CEDEGE la formaci6n de un
grupo de trabajo con Consultores y especialistas internacionales para disefiar la soluci6n a la
evacuacion de agua dulce por medio de dicho By Pass. Esta suspensi6n y todo el proceso de redisefno
se tradujo en una paralizaci6n de los trabajos de 18 meses en esta area.
Para Junio de 1.993, se habian expropiado los terrenos para la construcci6n del Campamento de una de
las empresas constructoras; y se gestionaba las transferencias del Gobiemo para el pago de las
expropiaciones de 1.960 hectareas (76% del total). Al siguiente aino, una nueva Ley agraria suprimia el
IERAC, generandose un obstaculo adicional que afectaba el programa de construcci6n y los costos por
atrasos. A junio de 1.995, la nueva Ley de Desarrollo Agrario privilegiaba el valor mercantil de la
tierra, lo que suscit6 aumentos de sus valores; a lo que se agregaba la falta de eficacia del nuevo
organismo INDA, que incorporaba otro componente de aumento de costos a] Proyecto. Algunos
propietarios de unidades agricolas se opusieron a la construcci6n de la obra, consecuentemente a]
proceso de expropiaci6n, valoraci6n y pago de la tierra requerida para el Proyecto. Pero mas alla de
ello en algunos casos signific6 cambios en los disefios para darle continuidad al Sistema de control de
inundaciones.
Una de las causas mas importante del aumento de costos de la obra, tiene sus origenes en el cambio de
los materiales para la construcci6n de los diques y otras obras; debido a la anticipaci6n, intensidad y
permanencia por casi un ano del Fen6meno de El Nino 97/98, que saturaron los materiates arcillosos
que constaban en los disefios. Hubo necesidad de recurrir a fuentes mas lejanas para obtener los
materiales menos plasticos y de mayor densidad, sin lo cual hubiese sido imposible ejecutar las obras y
controlar las crecientes que protegieron a la poblaci6n, los cultivos y la infraestructura productiva y
social. El otro componente muy importante del incremento de costos de la inversi6n, es el aumento de
la cantidad de obra ejecutada, segun se puede ver en el Cuadro:

Pro2rama de Desarrollo a-ricola (PDA). El PDA se basaba en la inversi6n de $USD 11,5 millones
de los agricultores del "Grupo Meta" apoyados por las acciones de Investigaci6n, Extensi6n,
25



Capacitaci6n - Organizaci6n de los agricultores y Coordinaci6n, que costarian $USD 8,7 millones. De
los recursos finalmente invertidos por $USD 2,2 millones no existe una evaluaci6n de la
transformaci6n real de los agricultores del "Grupo meta", cuyo apoyo debi6 haber terminado con el
programa de "titulaci6n de tierras". El PDA fue afectado por el retiro de la donaci6n del Gobierno de
Holanda. Sin embargo, existen evidencias del incremento de la superficie agricola del orden de las
17.000 hectareas, sembradas entre 1.996 y el 2.000, pero principalmente de grandes y medianos
agricultores y empresas agricolas, con valor de inversiones de aproximadamente $USD 60,0 millones.
En el informe de la Misi6n de Seguimiento del BIRF de Abril/1.997, se sefiala textualmente que:
"Como resultado de las obras de Control de inundaciones, el area sembrada en su zona de influencia
viene creciendo significativamente. Entre los cultivos mas importantes, el area de Canla de azucar se
habria incrementado en un 40%, mientras que la de Banano, lo habria hecho en un 20%".
Medio Ambiente v Plan Maestro. En Junio de 1.995, la implementaci6n del componente Medio
Ambiente habia sobrepasado las expectativas del SAR, porque en solo un afno, constituyeron un equipo
multidisciplinario con 5 especialistas, aplicaron un Manual de Entrenamiento de Medio Ambiente y
adquirieron el equipo de computaci6n adecuado. Se ejecutaban cinco Programas, con excelentes
resultados y sobre todo con proyecci6n beneficiosa de largo plazo, sin embargo, cambios
administrativos y la consecuente renuncia del Consultor que dirigia el PPMA y de los especialistas,
paralizaron esta actividad, que fue a partir de ahi inercial. En 1.998, se integra lo que quedaba del PDA
al Componente de Medio ambiente con las siguientes tareas especificas: (i) ampliaci6n del banco de
datos que incluya estudios de aguas subterraneas, superficiales, pesquerias artesanales y uso del suelo;
(ii) Construcci6n y traslado del laboratorio al campamento; (iii) Profundizaci6n de los estudios en area
de descarga del by pass. El presupuesto para el Plan Maestro era de $USD 2,5 millones ($ 2,1 costos
basicos y $ 0,4 contingencias) del prestamo BIRF, que no han sido aplicados a estos fines, porque
finalmente CEDEGE obtuvo financiamiento de la CAF para la ejecuci6n de este Programa.
Desarrollo Institucional. Con toda seguridad, el desarrollo institucional de CEDEGE, se ha visto
afectado por: 1) la transici6n conceptual que caracteriz6 al Gobierno 1.992 a 1.996, que propuso la
reducci6n del tamanlo del Estado, mediante la promulgaci6n de la Ley de Modernizaci6n y otras
Leyes; y 2) la elevada inestabilidad politica en el periodo 1.996 - 2.000. La "compra de renuncias", era
una buena propuesta para la reducci6n del tamafno del Estado, pero en su ejecuci6n no se discrimin6 el
personal que era necesario y valioso para las Instituciones del que debia salir. A esto habria que
agregarle la presencia del fen6meno de El Nifno 1997/98, en donde el Proyecto tuvo la posibilidad de
evidenciar sus beneficios, habiendo sido importante la decisi6n de realizar todas las inversiones y de
facilitar la gesti6n para que la obra tenga un comportamiento estable y eficaz durante dicho evento
extraordinario 2,2 veces mayor y mas intenso que El Nino 1.982/83.
Operacion y Mantenimiento (O&M). Desde 1.998, la propuesta para la O&M es que los usuarios se
organicen para el manejo directo del Sistema construido; hagan las obras complementarias, bajo el
esquema de la transferencia de los sistemas de riego tal como los que CEDEGE venia ejecutando en
los Sistemas de riego. Desde finales de 1.999 a mayo del 2.000, los usuarios se han constituido en un
Comite de Gesti6n, y han realizado algunas actividades de mantenimiento y reparaciones con sus
recursos de maquinarias y trabajadores; se contrat6 a una Consultora para que elabore un diagn6stico
de las alternativas posibles y del marco legal necesario para crear la Organizaci6n, que fue entregado a
CEDEGE; y se dispondria hasta Diciembre, a realizar una segunda etapa de Consultoria para disefnar y
conducir el proceso de constituci6n de la Junta de usuarios, el catastro, los mecanismos de recaudaci6n
y el Manual de O&M del Sistema.

21,69 + $ 16,73), que constituye en conjunto el 82% de lo adeudado; el otro 18% se habia producido
entre los anios 1.994 y 1.996. Pero ademas en 1.997, las empresas constructoras habian facturado por
$USD 55,54 millones y cobrado por $USD 33,85 millones, es decir el 61%; pero al existir la
expectativa del Prestamo de la CAF por $USD 50 millones, sobre esta deuda continuaron trabajando
durante 1.998 y facturaron por $USD 19,3 millones, alcanzando solo a cobrar $USD 2,57 millones, es
decir, el 13% de lo facturado. Para la realizaci6n de los Costos finales se han utilizado las siguientes

Se evidencia que el dnico financiamiento 100% cumplido sera el del BIRF; mientras que el GOE ha
cumplido el 60,7% de su compromiso de financiamiento; el GOH retir6 su donaci6n, dejando
solamente pagado menos de $USD 200.000; y los Beneficiarios del Proyecto no registran ninguna
inversi6n. Se incorporaron al financiamiento, en el proceso de ejecucion del Proyecto, la CAF por
gestion de CEDEGE y la COPEFEN con la "no objeci6n" dada por el BIRF. En relaci6n con la CAF,
CEDEGE habia logrado la aprobaci6n de un prestamo por $USD 50,0 millones de los cuales recibi6
$USD 11,98, mediante un "prestamo puente" (de $USD 12,2 millones), mientras que el saldo
comprometido por $USD 37,8 debera concretarse para cancelar las planillas a los contratistas. Para la
totalidad de la obra construida, adquisiciones y servicios ejecutados son por $USD 140,0. La
comparaci6n con el presupuesto del SAR, esta en el Cuadro 8.

Segiin el Cuadro  de arriba, al final el GOE  habra participado  mediante trasferencias directas del
Presupuesto del Estado con un aporte de $USD 20,87 millones, es decir 104% con relaci6n a lo
previsto en el SAR. La diferencia entre lo Programado en el SAR y lo ejecutado, para el caso del BIRF,
debe tener en cuenta el retiro del aporte del GOH y las condiciones propias de un Proyecto de ocho
afnos de ejecucion que oblig6 a esas modificaciones en el uso de los recursos.

Prestatario
En el mismo Contrato de Prestamo BIRF 3276-Ec, se definen las relaciones con el GOE y CEDEGE,
dejando establecido que el "Convenio de Prdstamo" es entre el GOE y el BIRF, mientras que
simultaneamente se suscribe el "Convenio sobre el Proyecto" entre CEDEGE y el BIRF. El Gobierno
estaba comprometido mediante el Convenio de Prestamo con el BIRF a un aporte de $USD 20,0
millones durante la construcci6n del Proyecto, y solo lo hizo por $USD 12,14 millones (6 1%). Pero el
Ministerio de Finanzas se comprometi6 a hacer constar, para 1.999, una partida presupuestaria de
$USD 26 millones. Sin embargo, el BIRF, bajo las consideraciones de la inminencia del fen6meno de
El Nifio permiti6 el uso de sus fondos, porque en sustituci6n se obtenia el Prestamo de la CAF por
$USD 50,0 millones y ademas se transferian recursos por la emergencia desde la COPEFEN por $USD
4,5 millones en 1.997 y luego en el anio 2.000 por $USD 5,45 millones. Del prestamo a la CAF por
$USD 50 millones, se concret6 un prestamo puente por $USD 12,2 millones que se hizo efectivo en
1.997 y 1.998 principalmente, y se continuan haciendo gestiones por la suscripci6n del Prestamo por
los $USD 37,8 millones. Pero, ademis, debe tenerse en cuenta que desde 1.996 el GOE estaria
pagando el principal del Prestamo BIRF mas los intereses correspondientes, y desde 1.992 comisi6n de
compromiso e intereses sobre saldo deudor. Similares compromisos con la CAF desde 1.997.
Solamente para la parte pagada del Proyecto por $USD 93,27 millones, los desembolsos y pagos de
prestamos por el GOE serian los siguientes:

En esta Tabla se asientan los valores de la COPEFEN como aportes del GOE, pues como prestamos
corresponden a otra cuenta. Sobre estos $USD 132,53 millones habria que incluir posteriormente lo
correspondiente a los $USD 46,75 millones adeudados, dependiendo de las fuentes de fondos que se
obtengan finalmente para pagarlos. Con todo, al evaluar el Proyecto en esta hipotesis real "despues de
financiamiento", la TIR para el periodo de 25 affos va a aumentar hasta el 30% (desde el 26% en el
analisis "antes de financiamiento"). Y para el periodo hasta el anio 2.000, la TIR se incrementa auin mas
pues pasa a 28%, siendo en la otra hip6tesis del 16%. CEDEGE debera realizar una evaluaci6n de los
beneficios del GOE a efectos de demostrar el porcentaje de la inversi6n que recupera tanto en terminos
econ6micos como financieros, para que ademas obtenga una metodologia para la formulaci6n futura de
este tipo de Proyectos.
AGENTES DE FINANCIAMIENTO
Inicialmente, en 1.992 y hasta 1.995, los agentes de financiamiento del Proyecto eran: BIRF, GOH y
los Beneficiarios del Proyecto. Para 1.996 ya era definitiva la suspensi6n de la donaci6n del GOH, se
reducia el PDA y por tanto la posibilidad de hacer cumplir al "Grupo Meta" su programa inversiones
en mejoramiento de cultivos. Oportunamente se logr6 la participaci6n de la CAF y la COPEFEN con
mas de $USD 22,0 millones en conjunto.

Banco Interamericano de Reconstrucci6n y Fomento (BIRF). Aunque el Programa de construcci6n
del Proyecto fue planteado en el SAR para siete ahos, entre 1.991 y 1.997, el Programa de desembolsos
del Prestamo fue propuesto para ejecutarse en nueve anios. Los desembolsos del Prestamo se iniciaron
en 1.992 y se extenderAn hasta el segundo semestre del aho 2.000, con lo cual el plazo establecido se ha
cumplido, con el solo desplazamiento de un a-no, que para la complejidad del Proyecto y las
condiciones de fen6menos naturales, ademas de la crisis por la que ha pasado el Pais en este lapso, es
indudablemente un buen resultado.

Para 1.995, el atraso en la ejecuci6n del Prestamo lleg6 al maximo $USD 11,5 millones (-20%).
Evidenciandose que en 1.997 el Banco contribuy6 con CEDEGE al facilitar el uso de los fondos ante la
certeza del fen6meno de El Nifio, desembolsando hasta el 89% del prestamo hacia finales de ese anio.
Para los prop6sitos de contribuir a que CEDEGE y el Proyecto cumplan con sus objetivos, el BIRF
realiz6 veinte Misiones de Supervisi6n, incluida una para la "Revisi6n de Medio tiempo" en Junio de
1.995 y otra para la "Evaluaci6n Econ6mica del Proyecto", en Octubre de 1.998. En la Evaluaci6n de
1.998, se calculaba que la inversi6n realizada a la fecha y el excelente funcionamiento de las obras e
instalaciones del Proyecto, habian evitado danios superiores a los $USD 100 millones en la temporada
de altas precipitaciones y caudales de 1.997/98.
Gobierno de Holanda. En febrero de 1.995, el GOH comunic6 al BIRF "su intenci6n de
cancelar su contribuci6n financiera para el Proyecto, basado en el pobre desempeino
institucional, reflejado en el bajo indice de desembolsos de los componentes financiados
por el mismo." La argumentaci6n del GOH de "pobre desempefno institucional" de haber
sido verdad lo seria para el BIRF, que reconocia los problemas, pero tambien los esfuerzos
y las dificultades que debia enfrentar CEDEGE para cumplir con los compromisos.El
BIRF se comprometi6, en julio de 1.995, comunicar al GOH las consecuencias de su retiro
del PDA, incluyendo los aspectos legales pertinentes.
EVALUACION ECONOMICA
El esfuerzo financiero del Gobierno, con sus aportaciones durante la construcci6n y que continuaran
con el servicio de toda la deuda adquirida y el trabajo realizado por CEDEGE en la gesti6n y ejecuci6n
del Proyecto, hace de esta inversi6n una tipica acci6n del Estado en apoyo a las actividades

productivas, seguridad para la poblaci6n y de la infraestructura social y econ6mica, que evidentemente
ya ha generado beneficios economicos y financieros en la Zona de la Cuenca Baja.

El Sistema construido ha generado Beneficios desde 1.996 hasta el 2.000 por $USD 132 millones,
mientras las inversiones pagadas son $USD 93,27 millones; que significa una relaci6n B/C = 1,42.
Hasta el anlo 2.006, los Beneficios netos alcanzarian los $USD 260 millones y las inversiones pagadas
serian los $USD 140 millones, por lo tanto la relaci6n B/C sera 1,86. Para la totalidad del periodo de
evaluaci6n 1.992 - 2.016, los Beneficios Netos del Sistema construido serian de $USD 501 millones
sobre una inversi6n de $USD 140.02 millones, da una la relaci6n B/C = 3,5. De los agricultores
dependera la perpetuaci6n y mejoramiento del Sistema construido, para proyectar sus beneficios mas
alla del afio 2.016, que es solamente un plazo para la evaluaci6n de la inversi6n realizada por el Estado
ecuatoriano.
Se evalta la inversi6n total realizada en dos horizontes: el primero hasta el final del afno 2.000 y el otro
a 25 anios. En ambos casos a partir de 1.992 cuando se inici6 el flujo de inversiones. Con base en el
"Flujo Neto" del Cuadro 3.2, la rentabilidad econ6mica del Sistema construido seria la siguiente:

Al anio 2.000, los beneficios producidos, ya han generado a la economia nacional un VPN(12%) de
5,34 millones, despues de haber pagado la inversi6n por $USD 93,27. Estos $USD 5,34 equivalen a
$USD 1,0 mill6n anual o VAE a la misma tasa del 12%. A 25 anlos, es decir hasta finales del anio 2.016,
el Sistema de Control de inundaciones generaria un VPN (12%) de $USD 47,11 millones, despues de
pagar la totalidad de la inversi6n por $USD 140,02 millones y los Costos de operaci6n, mantenimiento
e inversiones complementarias incorporados en esta evaluaci6n.
