MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TIM PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RPECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO TIE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO TIE REPUBLIS OF ECUADOR
FOR THE
MMER IUAYAI FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Ecuador for USS59.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan, which would be repayable in 17 years, including
five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, would help
to finance a flood control project in the southwestern coastal area.
2.          Background.  The agricultural sector is an important contributor
to Ecuador's economy, accounting for about 14% of GDP. It provides some 95%
of the total food supply and is the principal foreign exchange earner,
currently generating about 52%. Because agricultural production is
labor-intensive, agriculture's importance to national employment, especially
for the poor, is substantial. Despite high rural-to-urban migration, the
agricultural sector still employs about half of Ecuador's economically active
population. With rural incomes substantially below urban levels and
underemployment in rural areas about 50% of available labor, agricultural
growth and improved productivity are essential to expand employment and
enhance the incomes of Ecuador's poor.
3.          There is considerable scope to improve sectoral performance.
Although Ecuador has favorable conditions for growing most crops, agricultural
land remains under-exploited. Only about 44% of land suitable for cropping
and about 62% of its pasture land are fully utilized. In addition, except for
bananas and palm oil, average yields have not increased for major crops,
remaining at levels well below those obtained by neighboring countries.
Considerable scope exists also to boost agricultural exports. The comparative
advantage of Ecuador's traditional export commodities--bananas, coffee, cacao
and shrimp-- remains strong. Ecuador also has good conditions for the
production of rice, fresh fruit, vegetables and flowers. A sound economy and
policies which encourage agricultural investment could stimulate production
and lead eventually to sustained export of these nontraditional export crops.
4.          In recent years, Bank lending to agriculture has been focused in
three areas: (a) policy reform in pricing, trade and credit; (b) provision of
investment credit; and (c) an area specific attack on rural poverty. The
Bank's operations in these areas have been met with varying degrees of
success. Liberalization of agricultural trade and marketing, pursued through
an Agricultural Sector Loan (Ln. 2626-EC), has not been achieved, though the
activities of the State Marketing Companies which were targeted under the loan
have been partially reduced, as have subsidies on imported commodities,
especially wheat. Some progress has also been made on the reduction of
external trade restrictions, but further efforts in this direction are still
needed.
5.          In the area of agricultural credit, solid progress has been
achieved with a general agreement on official interest rates, which are
scheduled to rise to market levels by June 1992. Under the Second
Agricultural Credit Project (Ln. 2752-EC) commercial bank participation in
lending to agriculture has been increased and Bank resources have been made
available to the sector in an increasingly competitive environment. At the
same time a major reorganization of the National Development Bank (BNF), the
principal official source of agricultural credit, is being financed by the



loan with the agreed objectives of modernixing its operations and enabling it
to compete more effectively with private commercial banks.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
6.          Looking to the future, the priority needs of the agricultural
sector are as follows: (a) continued liberalization of trade and marketing to
minimize distortions and to increase the efficiency of resource allocation
within the sector and between agriculture and other sectors of the economy;
(b) investment in infrastructure, especially flood control, irrigation and
rural roads; (c) technology generation and transfer; and (d) conservation and
management of natural resources. Within these broad priority areas, the needs
of the commercial farm sector will be best served through the opening up of
trade and the development of more competitive financial markets. These forces
alone would significantly increase access to improved agricultural technology
and would improve investment incentives. In the small farm sector, however,
more direct interventions are needed, and this is where the main focus of Bank
lending should be.
7.          All of the priorities outlined above are being addressed through
Bank operations either under execution or under preparation. The main trade
issues are being incorporated into a proposed trade policy loan; and the
activities of the State Marketing Companies, the restructuring of BNF and the
maintenance of the interest rate agreement are being monitored closely through
the Second Agricultural Credit Project. In the last two years there has been
a notable improvement in the management and implementation of ongoing rural
development projects managed by the Ministry of Social Welfare (MBS) and
preparation is well advanced for a proposed Bank-financed operation in support
of a focussed National Rural Development Program. In parallel, discussions
are proceeding on a possible irrigation sector operation aimed at establishing
a more rational system than currently exists for coordinating, financing and
implementing irrigation investments-throughout the country and a proposed
environmental project is now in the early stages of discussion which would
establish a stronger institutional framework for environmental protection and
resource management.
8.          The Lower Guayas Flood Control Project proposed here is fully
consistent with the priorities outlined above. It is the first phase of the
long-term development of potentially the most productive agricultural region
in Ecuador and one which is heavily populated with small producers. By
providing the necessary infrastructure for flood control, combined with a
coordinated program of technical assistance, it would provide the necessary
conditions for an important increase in output and social well-being. The
Bank's involvement in the project has significantly reoriented its objectives
and resulted in: (a) a redesign of the project to take account of significant
environmental concerns raised in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA);
(b) a technical assistance component (20% of project cost) to strengthen the
institutions concerned with implementing the project; and (c) an Agricultural
Development Plan (PDA) to increase the project's social and productive focus.
9.          Proiect Obiectives.  The major objectives of the project would be
to: (a) reduce the risk of rural and urban flooding and resultant losses to
life, property and output in the Lower Guayas Basin; (b) improve health and
living conditions through flood control and drainage; (c) increase the
productive capacity of the Region; (d) enhance the capacity of central and
local organizations; (e) protect and conserve the natural environment in the
Lower Guayas Basin (800,000 ha), including the El Churute Reserve and part of
the Upper Basin (409,000); and (f) delineate a sound development strategy for
the area's natural and human resources through a master development plan to be
developed for the entire Lower Guayas Basin and for selected upper catchment
areas.

10.         Project Descriotion.  The project's flood control system would
benefit 188,800 urban and rural inhabitants in a priority area of 170,000 ha
through protection from up to lSO year frequency (catastrophic) flooding. In
any given year, an average of 36,400 people would be protected against major
flooding. The principal investments would consist of dikes, bypass
(flood-relief) channels, main and secondary drainage systems, rural roads,
bridges and various control and conveyance structures (54% of project costs).
11.         To ensure long-term sustainability, the project would include an
Agricultural Development Plan to support and improve production systems for
about 3,300 smallholders (<10 ha). The PDA would be a multi-institutional
effort coordinated by CEDEGE and would include: (a) adaptive research
programs in rice, cacao, and small-scale mechanization; (b) seed production;
(c) extension; (d) strengthening smallholder farmer organizations; and (e)
on-farm investment to be financed with a combination of farmers' own resources
or with commercial credit. The project would also provide support to a series
of environmental protection and conservation initiatives recommended by an EIA
conducted in 1989. This support would focus on the preparation of studies and
some immediate actions, within the project area and in its close vicinity,
such as: (a) the preparation and implementation of a long-term management
plan for the El Churute Reserve; (b) monitoring of environmental impacts on
water bodies, soil, and fauna; and (c) development and promotion of integrated
pest management practices.
12.         The project would include an institutional strengthening component
(technical assistance, training and provision of vehicles and equipment) for
CEDEGE and for agencies participating in agricultural development and
environmental initiatives. A monitoring and evaluation (N&E) process would
enable early identification of implementation problems and appropriate actions
to solve them. A mid-term review would analyze the impact of flood control
works, the delivery of the agricultural support services, the effectiveness of
the environmental measures taken and the results of the Guayas Master Plan and
the Environmental Studies, and would recommend necessary measures to be taken
to ensure optimal use of available resources to reach project targets.
13.         The total cost of the project is estimated at US$97.5 million
equivalent (US$91.0 million net of taxes and duties), with a foreign exchange
component of US$57.1 million (63%). The Bank would finance US$59.0 million
(65% of total net costs). The Government of the Netherlands (GON) is expected
to finance the Agricultural Development Plan and the Upper Watershed
activities within the environmental component (US$7.0 million) under joint
financing arrangements with the Bank. Project costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A.
14.         Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Ecuador are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. The map (IBRD No. 22256) indicates,
inter alia, project boundaries, main project features, and the EL Churute
Nature Reserve. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8792-EC, dated November 13,
1990, is attached.
15.         Acreed Actions: Agreement was reached at negotiations on the
following: (a) the Borrower would provide adequate and timely funding to
CEDEGE and other participating agencies for project-related O&W; (b)s (i)
project accounts, including the special account and SOEs would be maintained
and audited annually according to practices satisfactory to the Bank; (ii)
CEDEGE would hire a private auditing firm acceptable to the Bank; and (iii)
audit reports would be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after
the close of each fiscal year; (c) following receipt of the mid-term
recommendations, the GOB and the Bank would agree on any specific measure to
be taken to achieve project objectives; (d) adequate and timely counterpart



- 5 -
funds would be made available to CEDEGE and the other participating agencies
for the effective and timely execution of the project; (e) the loan agreement
would contain express provisions to resolve specific conflicts between Dank
procurement guidelines and local law; (f) CEDEGE would enter into subsidiary
agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, with ageacies participating in the
project implementation, including: (i) NAG and the applied research,
extension, rural development and farmer training institutions under MAG (for
the PDA); and (ii) the National Office of Forestry (for the environmental
component) not later than June 30, 1991; and (g) CEDEGE would satisfactorily
establish and put the monitoring system into operation not later than
June 30, 1991.
16.         Conditions of Loan Effectiveness would be:  (a) CEDE¢E would enter
into a subsidiary agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, with the Institute for
Land Reform and Settlement (for land titling and land acquisition);
(b) CEDEGE would submit to the Bank a satisfactory list of performance
indicators; (c) CEDEGE would satisfactorily complete an action plan to
strengthen its accounting procedures and staff; (d) the Borrower would enter
into an agreement with CEDEGE satisfactory to the Bank to make available to
CEDEGE the proceeds of the loan; and (e) reciprocal effectiveness of the GON
grant.
17.         8enefits.  The project's flood control system would prevent
significant annual losses in economic output, curtailment of commercial
activities and social services, destruction of private and public property,
increases in the incidence of water-borne disease, and loss of life. Both
urban and rural residents would benefit. Improved flood control and drainage
would result in higher yields and expanded cropping area, on-farm investment
would be more attractive, and small farmers would be more receptive to the
extension, research, land titling and organizational initiatives included in
the project. Financial benefits to GOE would include incremental value-added
and land tax and the avoidance of emergency expenditures for flood damage
repairs. The project would have a positive net ecological impact, reflecting
the changes in project design recommended by the ZIA to improve the general
ecology within the Guayas area, including enhanced management and protection
of the El Churute Reserve. The economic rate of return for the project has
been calculated at 15%.
18.         Risks.  (a) A change in government investment priorities could
cause inadequate counterpart funding. The current government has given high
priority to socially oriented projects in the sector, and its proposed
contribution (US$20.0 million) still represents a strong commitment. (b)
Environmental agencies and NGOs may withdraw commitment to the project if
environmental monitoring and corrective actions fail to match EIA goals. The
project's design, organization, and financing have been geared to fulfill EIA
expectations, and NGOs would be actively involved in periodic review of
implementation of EZIA recommendations. (c) CEDEGE lacks some experience in
multiagency coordination and agricultural development. Substantial technical
assistance and training would be financed by the project. (d) Benefits could
be reduced by institutional weakness and inadequate commitment of support
agencies. Considerable resources are proposed in the project to strengthen
all entities involved. Commitment would be strengthened through subsidiary
agreements between CEDEGE and each participating agency. (e) Deterioration of
the macroeconomic policy environment may undermine incentives for agricultural
production. The GOE's improved economic management and its recent agreement
with the IMF mitigates this risk.
