                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The revised PDO is to improve the Recipient's institutional and infrastructure environment for more productive, profitable and sustainable livestock and crop production
                         by pasture users and smallholder farmers, as well as to reduce the economic impact of the zoonotic disease burden in the human population.

                         Overall, the Project has contributed substantially to the Project Development Objective. While the M&E system does not capture the full impact of the Project on livestock productivity,
                         human health and improved food security three early results indicate substantial impact:

                         •        The prevalence of Brucellosis in sheep in the pilot district of Ak Tala were reduced by 2.45% from 9.95% in 2008 to 7.50% in 2012. This translates into an increased lambing
                         percentage of 2.45 percent exceeding the PDO target of a 1 percent increase. If the disease control strategy is successfully maintained, prevalence can be expected to drop to
                         around 2% based on similar experience in Tajikistan.
                         •        The number of human cases of Brucellosis in the first pilot region of Naryn halved from approximately 420 cases in 2008 to 210 cases in 2011, in contrast to an increase in
                         cases in regions were no sheep/ goat vaccination took place, achieving the target of a 50% decrease.
                         • The calorific food availability of farmers who were community seeds fund members increased by 46% during the project, exceeding the target of a 25 percent increase.

                         The full impact of the animal disease control programs and the pasture reforms, both of which are at an early stage, will only be evident over the next 5 years assuming a continued
                         commitment from government and donors (IDA/ IFAD).

                         1.1 Institutional and Infrastructure Environment for Farmers and Herders: The institutional environment for farmers and herders has been radically improved in several respects.

                         Firstly, the government was supported in preparing a radical new Pasture Law. Under the law, the management of pastures, which was previously fragmented between regional,
                         district and local governments, has been delegated to community based pasture user unions. Pasture committees (the executive body of pasture user unions) represent the interests
                         of all pasture users resulting in a more equitable allocation of pastures. The shift to a “pasture ticket? system under which each pasture users rights are defined in terms of livestock
                         numbers not pasture areas, is a foundation for preventing over-stocking. Increased pasture revenues (82 million som or about US$1.8 million in 2012 cf. a negligible amount in 2008)
                         show that pasture users are willing to pay for improved management and suggests that the chances of the new institutional arrangements being sustained are good. This has
                         benefited all pasture committee members nationwide (2.03 million). Pasture infrastructure was improved through 993 pasture infrastructure sub projects including bridges repairs,
                         road repairs, watering points, giving access to an additional 430,00 ha of pastures.

                         Secondly, the government was supported in implementing the Strategic Plan for Development of Veterinary Services. Landmark institutional changes under the strategic plan have
                         been (i) the legal establishment of an independent Veterinary Chamber which is responsible for registration and professional development of private vets; (ii) the contracting of public
                         veterinary services (vaccination) to a nationwide network of private vets; and (iii) the adoption of control strategies for six diseases, which are consistent with international best
                         practice. This has benefited all ruminant livestock owners nationwide.

                         Thirdly, Community Seeds Funds have been established in about 64 percent of all aiyl okmotu. 82 percent of these are growing or maintaining their membership. This capitalization of
                         Community Seed Funds has provided a mechanism to finance the provision of improved seed to the poorest farmers in each aiyl Okmotu. This has benefited 19,600 CSF members.

                         Fourthly, the Project supported the exit strategy, for the Bank’s long engagement in the development of the Rural Advisory Services both at the level of service provider and the client.

                         �        At the service provider level, the exit strategy has involved: (i) the division of service provider and client representation functions – RAS has been restructured from a

                         membership based association governed by a complex hierarchy of farmer councils into independent foundations governed by a small supervisory board; (ii) financial independence
                         for RAS – RAS is now financially independent of any single donor or government and free to define salaries and business operations; and (iii) introduction of competition for service
                         contacts – RAS now competes for contracts with other service providers. This provides the basis for a more independent, client responsive rural advisory service, evidenced by the
                         growth in turnover of RAS following two years after restructuring benefiting 74,000 RAS clients.

                         �        At the client level, the exit strategy, involved the creation of community based organizations (farmers koshuuns) for the procurement of advisory services from service
                         providers on a competitive basis. This approach aimed to establish a mechanism for farmers to procure advisory services independently, given the apparent lack of commitment from
                         government to fund buy advisory services. There has been low willingness to pay for advisory services and farmers koshuuns are likely to be sustained in about one in ten aiyl
                         okmotu w ithout government funding.

                         Fifth, the Project funded farmer field schools and demonstration on crop and livestock husbandry benefiting 21,500 farmers and training 110 farmer field school trainers.

                         1.2 Economic Impact on Zoonotic Disease Burden on the Human Population: The Project has succeeded in halving the incidence of Brucellosis in humans in the first target region
                         between 2009 and 2011 by preparing and implementing a strategy for Brucellosis control based on mass vaccination through contracts with private vets, establishment of a vaccine
                         cold chain and a mass public awareness campaign. This program which was expanded nationwide in 2011 has benefited all livestock owners nationwide and the entire Kyrgyz

                         rabies and the impact is expected to be evident over the coming 12-36 months. Disease strategies have also been designed and are being implemented for two transboundary
                         diseases - Foot and Mouth Disease and Petites Pestes Des Ruminant - that do not infect humans
