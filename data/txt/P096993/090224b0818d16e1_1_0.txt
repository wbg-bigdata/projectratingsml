                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The revised PDO is to improve the Recipient's institutional and infrastructure environment for more productive, profitable and sustainable livestock and crop production
                         by pasture users and smallholder farmers, as well as to reduce the economic impact of the zoonotic disease burden in the human population.

                         State Registration Service. Grants to pasture committees for pasture infrastructure and improvement substantially improved access to pastures. Over the past year, the pasture
                         committees have completed 127 microprojects on bridges repair, 128 on road repairs, 99 on watering points and 30 on other improvements. Under the Animal Health component, the
                         disease control strategies for brucellosis, echinococcosis, Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), rabies, anthrax and Petite Pestes de Ruminants (PPR) have been prepared. The

                         brucellosis control program has been rolled out nationwide for the first time and involved contracting of 1,547 private veterinarians to administer 8.6 million doses of vaccine.

                         The reorganization of advisory services has helped to create more independent Rural Advisory Services (RAS) and a competitive environment for the procurement of advisory
                         services. The special extension programs had established 470 demonstrations and 111 IPM farmer field schools. For procurement of advisory services, 458 farmers koshuuns have
                         been provided with grants (at 50% of the previous year’s allocation) as temporary support until the koshuuns gradually (over a 3-year period) learn to raise their own funds through
                         members’ contributions. The Community Seed Funds Program is expanding successfully with the establishment of 272 new community seed funds (CSF) since the start of the
                         program in 2008. An additional 20 CSFs are being established and will be provided with seeds and fertilizers this fall. To monitor and document the results of the project, an elaborate
                         M&E system is being developed with the help of an international expert while the PIU maintains full record of project activities and achievements. However, certain outcome indicators
                         have not yet been captured and need to be included, measured, monitored and reported under the new M&E system. The new M&E system can serve as a basis for new agricultural
                         projects (e.g., forthcoming IFAD-funded Livestock Development andMarketing Project).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1) The EC Food Crisis Rapid Response Facility TF096043 (EC TF), which was closed on June 30, 2012, was fully implemented and disbursed, except for about $35,503, and its
                         objective achieved. Now, the remaining project funds need to be reallocated among the expenditure categories so that the remaining funds can be spent on priority activities before
                         the closing date of June 30, 2013. The Agricultural Projects Implementation Unit (APIU) will draft a restructuring budget for the Banks’ review and the Ministry of Finance will submit to
                         the Bank a request for project restructuring.

                         2) Public Union of CSF and APIU to initiate a brainstorming session on improvement of membership and governance arrangements for CFS based on broader experience from the
                         region.
