                      Project Implementation and Completion Report


   1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design


1.1.Context at Appraisal

   1. Country Background. Armenia, a small landlocked country with few natural resources,
   achieved an impressive growth after the early 1990s period that followed independence from
   the Soviet Union, characterized by hyperinflation, economic contraction and fiscal crisis.
   Successful stabilization and structural reform programs resulted in annual growth rates of 5.5
   percent during the 1994-2000 period, six percent in 2001 and 12 percent during 2001-2003
   driven by an increased inflow of remittances and foreign investments.

   2. Sector Background. The country is divided in 10 regions regrouping 930 urban and rural
   communities plus Yerevan, itself divided in 12 districts. In 2004, about 2.0 million people
   out of the country’s total population of 3.2 million lived in urban centers, of which about 1.1
   million in the capital city Yerevan. Local governments are legally responsible for the water
   and wastewater (WW) service in their territory, but in fact the WW service is currently
   provided by five utility companies. In the capital city Yerevan, the WW service under the
   responsibility of the Yerevan Water and Sewerage Company (YWSC) has since 2006 been
   provided by Yerevan Djur, a private operator under a ten-year “Lease? contract. The service
   area of the Armenia Water and Sanitation Company (AWSC) includes 37 urban centers and
   283 rural communities regrouping a total of about 0.62 million people. AWSC is a public
   WW utility company whose shares, as that of the YWSC, are all owned by the State
   Committee for Water Economy (SCWE) of the Territorial Administration Ministry. SCWE
   oversees the WW and irrigation sectors since 2001. The three cities of Gyumri, Vanadzor
   and Armavir, have created their own WW utility companies with KfW assistance. About 560
   rural communities operate themselves their WW service. The Water Code adopted in 2002
   allows various models of Public-Private Partnerships (PPP), ranging from short-term Service
   and Management contracts to medium-term Lease contracts and long-term Concessions. In
   2003, the Public Services Regulatory Committee (PSRC) was given the responsibility for
   resetting WW tariffs and WW service standards.

   3. The Municipal Development Project (MDP). In 1998, the Bank granted a US$30
   million IDA Credit for a Municipal Development Project (MDP) that significantly improved
   the performance of the WW service provided by the YWSC hitherto characterized by high
   levels of operating and capital development inefficiencies. The outcome of the MDP closed
   in 2006 was rated “satisfactory?, its sustainability “likely? and its institutional development
   impact “substantial? in its Project Implementation Completion and Results (PICR) report.
   According to the latter, between 2000 and 2006, the “Management? contract entered into by

                                                1
   the Government of Armenia (GOA) and the YWSC with the private professional operator
   ACEA of Italy, helped:

         Improve the permanence of the water service from an average 7 to 18 hours/day;
         Increase the number of customers with a permanent water supply from 28 percent to
          50 percent;
         Reduce average water consumption from an assumed 250 liters per capita per day
          (lcd) to a metered 110 lcd;
         Decrease Unaccounted-for Water (UfW) from 870,000 m3/day to 723,000 m3/day,
          actually translating in an increase from 73 percent to 80 percent of water production;
         Limit energy consumption by 48 percent;
         Increase the individual metering ratio from almost zero to 80 percent; and
         Improve the bill collection ratio from 20 to 79 percent.

   4. Rationale for Bank Assistance. Following the MDP positive experience, the GOA
   decided to: (i) to pursue a more advanced form of PPP in Yerevan with a Lease of the WW
   service that transferred most operational and commercial risks as well as significant
   responsibilities for identifying and implementing a comprehensive rehabilitation program of
   the WW infrastructure to its private partner; and (ii) replicate the Management contract
   model to the AWSC. Both the Municipal Water and Wastewater Project (MWWP) approved
   in 2004 and the Yerevan Water and Wastewater Project (YWWP) approved in 2005 were
   conceived as a natural continuation of the Bank support provided under the MDP for
   modernizing Armenia’s WW sector. The YWWP closed at the end of 2011; its PICR report
   is being prepared in parallel with this PICR.
   5. In the early 2000s, financing requirements for improving the WW service were estimated
   at about US$700 million, of which US$550 million for activities outside of Yerevan; these
   figures have since been updated to US$1,700 million and US$1,100 million respectively. No
   specific financing plan and cost recovery arrangement have so far been developed to test the
   feasibility of these investments. In the early 2000s, other financing agencies involved in the
   urban WW sector included USAID, which helped develop the sector legal framework and
   KfW, which still supports the improvement of the WW service in the three towns listed
   above, also through a PPP with the Operator MVV of Germany. Since the early 2000s, the
   WW sector has been able to attract financing from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the
   European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the French Government.


1.2.Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

   7. Project Development Objectives. The 2001 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
   highlighted the need for financially and technically rehabilitating Armenia’s WW systems by
   improving utility financial discipline with better cash generation and expenditure
   management, improving WW services and rehabilitating sector infrastructure, and increasing
   efficiency of water distribution and use. The MWWP Project Development Objectives
   (PDOs), as stated in the 2004 Project Appraisal Document (PAD) were: “to improve: (i) the
   quality of services provided to customers in AWSC’s service area; and (ii) the sustainability
   of AWSC. The Development Credit Agreement (DCA) used a slightly different wording by
                                               2
   mentioning PDOs as being “to improve the quality of WW services in the Armenia Water and
   Sanitation Company (AWSC) Service Area by providing efficient and sustainable WW
   services and strengthening the capacity and sustainability of AWSC?. The 2008 Project
   Paper (PP) that requested approval for additional financing for the MWWP mentioned that
   PDOs would remain unchanged; the 2008 Financing Agreement (FA) used the same wording
   as that of 2004 DCA but replaced “Armenia Water and Sanitation Company? by “Project
   Implementing Entity?.

   8. Key Performance Indicators. The achievement of the PDOs was to be measured by a
   series of technical, commercial and investment outcome indicators: (i) technical: improved
   service reliability, improved water quality and greater operating efficiency; (ii) commercial:
   increased water company cash generation through reform of billing and collection operations,
   closer alignment of service tariffs with costs and better cash flows; and (iii) sector
   investments: all investments to be economically justified and to meet applicable safeguard
   policies. Specific results indicators were based on the criteria to be used for determining the
   incentive bonus of the Manager under the Management contract and included:
             The weighted average of daily hours of drinking water services;
             The percentage of individual subscribers billed on the basis of metered
               consumption;
             The weighted average water bacteriological safety compliance; and
             ASWC working ratio.
   In response to the 2001 CAS, that identified the financial rehabilitation of WW utility
   companies as one of the objectives to be pursued, and to the 2004 CAS that later highlighted
   the poor financial condition of public WW utility companies as the major constraint for
   infrastructure development and service improvement, the PAD proposed to monitor AWSC
   working ratio, i.e., the ratio of operating expenditures to operating revenues. If the working
   ratio is a good measurement of progress made towards recovering costs, it is of course only
   one of several indicators to measure the financial sustainability of a WW service provider.


1.3. Main Beneficiaries

   9. Armenia Water and Sanitation Company (AWSC). The main beneficiary of the
   MWWP was the AWSC, a public joint stock company owned by the SCWE. In 2004,
   AWSC employed about 2,370 staff, 2,250 of them based in more than 37 territorial Branches
   and the remainder in Yerevan where its headquarters were and are still based. This translated
   in a high staffing ratio of about 9.45 staff per thousand water connections. The PAD did not
   provide basic information on AWSC past technical operations such as water production,
   water sales, non-revenue water (NRW), number of connections and active accounts,
   wastewater collected and treated presumably because data available were considered
   unreliable.

   10. AWSC Fragile Financial Situation. The PAD however assessed AWSC past financial
   performance on the basis of its audited (2001) and provisional (2002 and 2003) financial
   statements. While ASWC revenues decreased from AMD 2,210 million (US$5.65 million)
   in 2001 to AMD1,890 million (US$4.85 million) in 2003, its collection evolved from

                                                3
   AMD960 million (US$2.45 million) to AMD1,110 million (US$2.85 million) translating in
   poor but improving collection ratios of 43 percent and 53 percent. Between 2001 and 2003,
   collected revenues were insufficient to cover O&M costs that increased from AMD2,135
   million (US$5.45 million) to AMD2,775 million (US$7.10 million). During that period if
   energy expenses declined from 42 to 30 percent, staff costs increased from 26 to 33 percent
   of O&M total expenditures. As a result of high energy and staff costs, maintenance was
   neglected and most facilities were steadily deteriorating. Cash deficits were met through a
   combination of GOA subsidies, direct payment by the GOA to the electric power company
   and to the YWSC for bulk water supplies. Cash deficits were also met through non-payment
   of the Value Added Tax (VAT). The PAD noted that as a combination of high VAT
   applying to WW services (20 percent, to be compared with an average five percent in OECD
   countries) and a very high ratio of operating expenses to collection and thus low VAT
   recovered from customers, and high environmental fees, the AWSC was devoting about 15
   percent of its collected revenues to the payment of taxes. Following the adoption of
   Armenia’s Law on Debt Forgiveness, 2003 AWSC balance sheet was to be restructured, its
   debt written off and deferred liabilities and other arrears significantly reduced.

   11. AWSC Customers. In 2004, AWSC served about 0.62 million people through an
   estimated 185,000 active accounts out of a total 251,000; about 15 percent of the population
   received water from public standpipes. The PAD mentioned that AWSC low collection was
   the result of: (i) limited ability and willingness-to-pay of households living in small towns
   and villages, whose income was estimated to be about half that of those living in Yerevan;
   and (ii) non-enforcement of AWSC disconnection for non-payment policy because of the
   poor quality of service provided and unfair billing procedures based on normative
   consumption. The culture of non-payment was more deeply ingrained in villages than in
   towns. The PAD discussed affordability of the WW service by low income customers and
   mentioned that enforcing collection of the WW bill could result in poorer households having
   to spend up to five percent of their income for their WW budget.


1.4. Original Components

   The MWWP originally included three main components: (i) AWSC management
   strengthening; (ii) AWSC investments; and (iii) investments in AWSC Branch systems.

   12. Component A: AWSC Management Strengthening. Under this component, the MWWP
   was to finance:
            The fixed fee and the performance bonus of the first four years of a six-year
              Management contract to be entered into by AWSC with a professional WW
              operator for improving administration, operations and maintenance, and ensuring
              optimal use of MWWP investment funds;
            The overall project management and supervision by the Contract Monitoring Unit
              (CMU) of the SCWE; and
            The refinancing of activities carried out under the Project Preparation Facility
              (PPF).


                                               4
   13. Component B: AWSC Investment. Several sub-components were to be financed to help
   improve WW operations:
          Communication equipment, instruments, hardware, software, spare parts and
            annual audits;
          A redundancy program to help reduce the size of the staff by about 610 and
            improve AWSC staffing ratio from 9.45 to 6.0 staff per 1,000 subscribers;
          Training facilities and a training and re-qualification program to familiarize
            AWSC staff and its contractors with good practice in well-managed WW utility
            companies;
          A chemical and bacteriological laboratory for analyzing drinking water and
            wastewater effluent samples, collection and transportation equipment and the
            refurbishment of local laboratories;
          A water meter testing laboratory;
          A revolving fund for the credit sale and installation of water meters;
          An assistance to condominium where about 50 percent of the population lived
            through the installation of block meters and repair of internal networks and the
            development of an investment program to fully refurbish the latter; and
          Incremental AWSC operating expenses, such as spare parts and chemicals.

   14. Component C: Investments in Branch Systems. This component was to finance the
   rehabilitation of water supply systems and sewerage networks as well as other Branch
   investments, such as offices or operating equipment. It was divided into two sub-
   components:
            An immediate investment program, identified prior to the mobilization of the
               Manager, so that the latter could start its implementation without delay, after
               amending it if necessary; and
            The design, implementation and supervision of rehabilitation and reconstruction
               of existing WW systems identified by the Manager.


1.5. Revised Components.

   The initial Credit represented only a small fraction of the total investment needs of the
   AWSC, in particular for rehabilitating and extending Branch systems. The Additional
   Financing (AF) approved in 2008 mostly increased the financing made available for the same
   three components.

   15. Component A: AWSC Management Strengthening. In addition to an additional two
   years of the Management contract and other sub-components listed above, the AF was to
   finance consulting services for preparing a strategy for implementing a “Lease? contract for
   AWSC service area, similar to that implemented in Yerevan.

   16. Component B: AWSC Investments. The same sub-components as above were to be
   financed, including consulting services for carrying out AWSC fixed assets inventories and
   revaluation and reviewing its O&M costs.


                                              5
   17. Component C: Investments in Branch Systems. The Project Paper (PP) for the AF
   provided a more detailed description of activities to be financed, including:
           Supply and replacement of treatment and chlorination equipment;
           Supply and installation of pressure loggers, pipes and fittings, water meters and
              chambers and pumping stations;
           Repair and reconstruction of sector offices; and
           Design and construction for rehabilitating the water network in the city of
              Hrazdan.

   18. Project Restructuring. The Restructuring Paper (RP) of 2011 simply requested an
   extension of the closing date of the AF by two months and a reallocation of the proceeds of
   the original Credit to use savings generated from the SDR/US$ currency exchange variations
   to finance the Management contract until end 2011, and the AF to use savings to prepare
   feasibility studies and designs for WW systems in two towns.


   2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes


2.1.Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

   19. Soundness of the Background Analysis. Project preparation activities financed by the
   US$1.2 million PPF focused mostly on: (i) reviewing PPP options for improving AWSC
   performance and alternatives for implementing the MWWP; (ii) drafting the Management
   contract and organizing the selection of the Manager; and (iii) identifying the priority
   construction program to be implemented by the AWSC. Both the GOA and its consultants
   performed satisfactorily, as evidenced by the mobilization of an experienced Manager
   (SAUR of France) after a fair and transparent competition that attracted proposals from four
   reputable operators from France, Germany and Italy.

   20. Assessment of the Project Design. The MWWP aimed at addressing the key
   institutional, technical and financial issues the AWSC was faced with.
             Operational: Since the outcome of the MWWP was highly predicated upon the
               successful implementation of the Management contract its signing was a
               condition of Credit effectiveness. The Manager was to be requested, in addition
               to reorganizing all the core AWSC technical, commercial, financial and human
               resources development functions, to identify, prepare, implement and supervise
               the capital expenditure program (CAPEX) described above.
             Technical: the MWWP objectives mostly focused on improving the permanence
               of the water supply service, improving the bacteriological quality of the water
               distributed, metering water consumed by customers and saving energy.
             Financial: the submission of a proposal for restructuring AWSC balance sheet in
               application of GOA Law on Debt Forgiveness to IDA and the Manager was also a
               condition for Credit effectiveness. Because of AWSC fragile financial situation,
               the PAD suggested that the Bank jointly reviewed with AWSC: (i) AWSC
               financial performance, including revenues and expenditures for the preceding and

                                              6
           following semesters, on a semi-annual basis; (ii) AWSC financial projected
           performance for the following two years on the basis of forecasts prepared by
           AWSC, on an annual basis; and (iii) steps to be taken, including but not limited to
           tariff increases and improved collections to ensure adequacy of revenues and
           planned subsidies to meet projected financial requirements. Neither the 2004
           DCA nor the 2008 Project Agreement (PA) covenanted these regular reviews.

21. Lessons from Earlier Operations in Armenia. The PAD discussed the “strategic?
choices that were made during preparation of the MWWP, namely: (i) the appointment of a
private professional operator to manage AWSC operations; (ii) the support to AWSC as a
WW utility company with a national coverage, rather than to a series of municipal WW
utility companies carved out of AWSC service area, as was the case for the three companies
of Gyumri, Vanadzor and Armavir; and (iii) an initial focus on water production and
distribution and wastewater collection in medium and small towns while limiting activities to
bulk supplies to villages. The PAD also listed several lessons learned from the successful
implementation of the MDP and urban WW projects worldwide, such as:
          Building the ownership by the end-borrower (AWSC), Ministry of Finance and
            Economy (MOFE), CMU, participating municipalities, AWSC staff and the
            community at large;
          Ensuring readiness of construction components of the project to avoid
            implementation delays;
          Ensuring availability of counterpart funds of 10 percent of contract costs net of
            tax; and selecting the Manager after a competitive process for achieving
            transparency and optimum pricing.

22. Lessons from Similar Operations in other Countries. Bank financed urban WW
projects usually aim at improving the financial performance of WW utility companies by
including in the legal documents financial covenants adapted to the issues to be addressed
and by closely following-up on their compliance during implementation. The legal
documents for the MWWP did not include covenants to cause AWSC gradually: (i)
generating sales revenues to first cover its operation and maintenance (O&M) costs and later
its capital costs; (ii) reducing its heavy reliance on explicit and implicit subsidies; and (iii)
limiting the accumulation of customer arrears.

23. Adequacy of the Government’s Commitment. The GOA strong commitment to
reforming the WW sector was demonstrated under the MDP and the preparations of the
MWWP and YWWP with: (i) the passing of the Water Code; (ii) the creation of the SCWE;
(iii) the transfer of responsibility for resetting WW tariffs and monitoring performance of
operators to a semi-autonomous regulatory body (PRSC); (iv) the successful implementation
of the initial YWSC Management contract; (v) the willingness to replicate this PPP model to
the AWSC and the three independent WW utilities supported by KfW; and (vi) the decision
to finance the Lease contract in Yerevan from the tariff rather than from external sources, as
is the case for the above mentioned Management contracts. Also the GOA capacity to
efficiently implement WW projects was demonstrated under the MDP, whose outcome was
rated “satisfactory?.


                                             7
24. Assessment of Risks and Mitigation Measures. The 2004 PAD identified a wide range
of risks to PDOs and component results. Overall the MWWP risk was rated “substantial?.
         From outputs to objectives. The risk of a lack of support in a consistent and
            coordinated manner of the WW sector, identified as the main risk to PDOs, was
            rated “negligible? because of SCWE leadership in the successful Yerevan
            Management contract under the MDP was expected to continue.
         High risks from components to outputs. The non-payment of WW bills by
            residential customers was considered a “high? risk to be mitigated through
            incentives included in the Management contract under the form of bonus linked to
            the collection performance.
         Substantial risks from components to outputs. Two risks were rated “substantial?:
            (i) insufficient allowances for WW expenses in social assistance programs, a risk
            to be mitigated through a Bank-financed Social Protection Administration project;
            and (ii) insufficient financial resources for addressing all pressing needs that
            could result in a major breakdown in the provision of safe water, a risk to be
            mitigated through a coordination between GOA sector professionals and AWSC
            Manager.
         Modest risks from components to outputs. Among the risks rated “modest?, the
            PAD listed: (i) a poor support to PPP in WW, a risk to be mitigated by the GOA
            strong commitment to reforming the sector; (ii) a limited success of the Armenia
            Social Investment Fund (SIF) in providing WW services in rural areas, a risk to
            be mitigated through an increase collaboration between SIF and AWSC; and (iii)
            AWSC incapacity to bear the foreign exchange under the Subsidiary Loan
            Agreement (SLA) for the IDA Credit, a risk to mitigated by a transfer back to the
            MOFE in case foreign exchange variations were deemed unaffordable by AWSC.

25. Revised Assessment of Risks and Mitigation Measures. The 2008 PP for the AF
identified a set of different risks that took into account the experience gained during the four
years of implementation of the initial project:
         Substantial risk. The inadequate political support to tariff increases and to
            institutional and financial improvements of the AWSC was assessed a
            “substantial? risk to be mitigated by targeted programs aimed at protecting low
            income households against high water bills.
         Modest risks. Possible political influence in the management of the AWSC, the
            inadequacy of the preparation and approval procedures of annual investment
            programs, the poor targeting of the latter, the limited capacity of contractors to
            deliver quality constructions and the possibility of cost overruns were identified
            as “modest? risks in view of past track records.
         Low risks. The dismantling of AWSC, a condition for Credit suspension, and the
            incapacity of providing counterpart financial contributions were assessed as “low?
            risks.

26. Other Potential Risks. Because neither the 2004 PAD nor the 2008 PP included a
    financial forecast of AWSC operations, AWSC bankruptcy, as a result of accumulated
    losses and/or reduction of GOA subsidies was not identified as a risk. Also, despite the
    outcome of the MWWP being heavily predicated upon the successful implementation of

                                             8
    the Management contract, its early termination – because of poor performance of the
    Manager, reduced interest of the Manager in AWSC operations or the impossibility of
    mobilizing external funds to finance it – was not identified as a risk either.

27. Quality at Entry.
       Project preparation. Project preparation activities focused on the drafting of the
           Management contract, the selection of the Manager and the identification of the
           CAPEX to be implemented in the first year of the MWWP. These activities were
           successfully carried out, as evidenced by the timely mobilization of a reputable
           Manager after a flawless selection process. In addition to the Management
           contract, the project was to finance the acquisition of equipment for upgrading
           AWSC operations and the rehabilitation of existing water production distribution
           networks connections and meters. The CAPEX identified during preparation for
           the first year of implementation was indicative, and its exact definition was left to
           the Manager. The project was also to finance a potentially controversial program
           aimed at reducing AWSC work force by about 25 percent; consultations with
           affected parties were held prior to Credit effectiveness, but actual identification of
           staff to be terminated was left to the Manager.
       Project justification. The PAD justified the project by estimating its Net Present
           Value (NPV) at US$12.5 million and its Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR)
           at 14 percent based on efficiency gains expected from the Management contract.
           It also estimated its Economic Rate of Return (ERR) at 11 percent on the basis of
           energy savings; the impacts of avoided “coping costs?, reduced wastewater
           overflows or limited water-borne diseases incidence could not be quantified.
       Affordability. The PAD mentioned that the MWWP scope and size were based on
           affordability considerations, and that the rate of increase and restructuring of the
           tariff over the project period had taken into account the impact of the water bill on
           household budgets, estimated to be in the one percent range. The PAD addressed
           the affordability issue mostly by proposing the subsidization of the installation of
           residential meters for poor households and the establishment of a two-block tariff
           for metered consumption and the elimination of fixed fee for poor households.
       Financial Covenants. The PAD highlighted AWSC weak financial situation by
           providing a summary of its income statements for FY2001 to 2003 and
           commenting on its revenues, O&M expenses and liabilities. But, it did not
           include a medium-term forecast of AWSC income and cash flow statements and
           balance sheet, as is standard practice for WW projects implemented by revenue
           earning utility companies (OMS 2.20). The PAD listed however a series of
           assumptions with the main objective of estimating the project NPV and FIRR.
           o The PAD proposed that “any change in the level or structure of tariffs will be
                implemented in accordance with Armenian legislation, including with
                previous recommendations by the Management contractor – as recommended
                by the PPIAF study – financed regulator study? that was however not
                translated in a covenant in the legal documents. In the absence of discussion
                of procedures to be followed by the Regulator for resetting tariffs, such a
                proposal was rather meaningless.


                                             9
             o Both the PAD and the legal documents mentioned an on-lending of the IDA
               Credit by MOFE to AWSC on its exact same terms including a transfer of the
               foreign exchange risk to AWSC. The rationale for lending to a WW utility
               company whose 2003 sales revenues and actual collection of water bills were
               respectively 68 and 40 percent of its operating expenses was not very clear as
               AWSC would be able to repay the loan to the GOA only if receiving subsidies
               from the GOA.
             o The PAD proposed a covenant whereby “MOFE will provide funds required
               by the AWSC for: (i) operating subsidies to cover all cash needs which cannot
               be covered by collected revenues, including but not limited to expenses for
               O&M, social security payments, VAT and other taxes, environmental charges
               and debt service; (ii) local counterpart financing of the MWWP costs; and
               (iii) any import duties, VAT and other taxes on MWWP investments (goods,
               works and services). The operating subsidies will be recommended by the
               Management contractor, approved by the Contract Management Board
               (CMB), adopted by the GOA and included in its annual budget? that was not
               translated in the legal documents. If the PAD mentioned that the AWSC was
               expected to break even, i.e., to cover its cash operating expenses from its cash
               collected revenues in 2009, the legal documents did not include a covenant on
               the evolution of AWSC working ratio and accounts receivable.

29. Component A: AWSC Management Improvement. More than US$20.0 million or 39
percent of the total project cost were devoted to improving AWSC management.
        Management contract. Out of it, a total of almost US$17.0 million was paid to
            the Manager between end 2004 and end 2011, of which US$14.5 million, or 85
            percent, in fixed fees and US$2.5 million, or 15 percent, in performance bonus.
            The Manager initially provided a team of 10 expatriates; at the end the project the
            Manager’s team included an expatriate General Director (also member of AWSC
            Board of Directors) who had been in place since the beginning of operation, and
            three Armenian senior staff. Throughout project implementation, the Manager
            has received back office support from its headquarters, but this was not formally
            monitored.
        Support to the Contract Monitoring Unit (CMU). This subcomponent financed the
            operating costs of the CMU, including staff salaries, project audits and the
            purchase of equipment (software, hardware).
        Preparation of the Lease contract. This component was eventually financed by
            an EBRD grant.

30. Component B: AWSC Investments. About US$7.0 million or 14 percent of the total
project cost were used to for AWSC investments.
         General assistance and AWSC incremental expenses. This subcomponent
            financed the purchase of equipment, machinery, vehicles and chlorine for AWSC
            operations.
         Redundancy program and training program. About 610 employees were
            terminated during the first two years of the project; statutory severance packages
            paid eventually were lower than what was budgeted. As a result, salaries of the

                                             11
                  remaining staff could be increased to encourage performance. AWSC organized
                  training courses at its own cost at the training center established with project
                  funds in Echmiadzin on a wide range of technical and administrative matters. As
                  a result, project funds earmarked for training could be reallocated to other
                  components.
                 Laboratories. Chemical, bacteriological and meter laboratories were equipped as
                  initially scheduled.
                 Meter revolving fund. About 60,000 meters were installed under the MWWP and
                  the revolving funds helped finance the supply and installation of about 2,000
                  meters for low income households.
                 Assistance to condominiums. While internal networks of residential and
                  commercial buildings are not legally under AWSC responsibility, this sub-
                  component was used to help reduce physical losses by replacing leaking pipes and
                  valves in basements of apartment buildings .

    31. Component C: Investments in Branch Systems. About US$25.0 million or little less
    than 50 percent of the total project cost were used for investments in Branch systems.
            Immediate investment program. This sub-component focused on the full
               rehabilitation of two water treatment plants in Dilijan, the construction of two
               water reservoirs in Sevan and the replacement of leaky pipes in these two cities.
            Main investment program. This sub-component financed the rehabilitation of 10
               pumping stations and 13 storage reservoirs and the installation of 221 km of water
               distribution pipes in the 14 urban areas of Tsakhkadzor, Charentavan, Ashtarak,
               Aparan, Gavar, Ararat, Yeghegnadzor, Masis, Vedi, Alaverdi, Tashir,
               Noyemberyan, Stepanavan and Hrazdan. It also financed the purchase of 59
               energy efficient pumps and the replacement of180 km of distribution pipes in
               other urban and rural areas. Finally this sub-component financed the supply and
               installation of chambers for residential water meters transferred from private to
               public land.

2.3.Monitoring and Evaluation: Design, Implementation and Utilization

    32. Design and Implementation. The 2004 PAD proposed to monitor the improvement of
    the water supply service through four main performance indicators; the rather complex
    formula to be used basically consisted in dividing the indicator for the year minus the
    indicator for the base year by the target indicator minus the indicator for the year. 1 The PAD
    set improvement objectives, but mentioned that the definition of baseline data would be the
    responsibility of the Manager. Below is a summary of the objectives:
             Weighted average of daily hours of drinking water service: target 24 hours per
                day; gradual improvement by 30 percent by the fourth year of the Management
                contract;
             Metering ratio of individual subscribers: target 85 percent; gradual improvement
                by 80 percent by the fourth year of the Management contract;
1
 For example if the baseline data for the number of hours of service was 6, the target number of hours of service
was 24 and the number of hours of service in a particular year for the year was 12, the improvement of the service
constancy could be estimated at (12 – 6) / (24 – 6) = 33 percent.

                                                         12
                Weighted average of water bacteriological safety compliance: target 100 percent;
                 gradual improvement by 70 percent by the fourth year of the Management
                 contract; and
                AWSC working ratio: target 100 percent; gradual improvement by 68 percent by
                 the fourth year of the Management contact.

    33. Revised Indicators. The 2008 PP confirmed that similar service quality improvement
    indicators would be used to monitor progress under the AF but set clearer targets to be
    reached by the end of the Management contract such as: (i) a weighted average of 18 hours
    of water supply service in the AWSC service area; (ii) 98 percent compliance ratio with
    bacteriological quality standards; (iii) 100 percent metering of individual connections; and
    (iv) AWSC working ratio of 100 percent. If the bonus payment to the Manager was to be
    calculated on the basis of the four main performance indicators listed above, the CMU in fact
    monitored a total of 22 sub-indicators for documenting progress achieved on:
             Permanence of the water service: (i) percentage of cities with minimum water
                hours;
             Water quality: (i) percentage of water disinfected;
             Metering: (i) percentage of apartment buildings with individual or common block
                meters; (ii) ratio of bills established on the basis of metered consumption; (iii)
                ratio of metered consumption to water production;
             Bill collection: (i) revenue collected per capita; (ii) residential collection ratio;
                (iii) percentage of customers with more than four months of arrears;
             Production and consumption; (i) production per capita; (ii) metered consumption
                per capita;
             Efficiency: (i) electricity costs as percentage of revenue collected in branches with
                pumping stations; (ii) staffing ratio per 1,000 subscribers; (iii) staff costs as
                percentage of collected revenues; (iv) electricity consumption in kWh/year;
             Operating costs recovery: (i) average tariff per m3 for metered consumption; (ii)
                growth of revenue collected from residential customers; (iii) average working
                ratio for branches with gravity systems; and (iv) average working ratio for
                branches with pumping stations.
    Non-revenue water (NRW), an indicator commonly used for measuring the efficiency of a
    WW utility company was not one of the performance indicators listed in the Management
    contract (see discussion on NRW below).

    34. Financial Indicators. The above indicators have helped document the excellent progress
    achieved for improving the reliability and the efficiency of the water supply service. 2 But
    reconciling them with data available in AWSC audited financial statements would have
    provided a more balanced picture of the overall progress achieved for improving AWSC
    sustainability. In particular, performance indicators monitored could not help raise “red
    flags?: despite significant service wuality improvements, AWSC was not making real
    progress towards recovering its cash operating costs from its cash collection and was still
    highly dependent upon the availability of GOA subsidies to survive. Annex 3 gives a rapid

2
  No indicators were designed for monitoring progress achieved for sanitation and wastewater collection and
treatment.

   2.4.Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

        35. Environmental Safeguards. MWWP triggered two safeguard policies: OP/BP 4.01
        Environmental Assessment, and OP/BP 4.11 Physical Cultural resources. The project closed
        with satisfactory performance on the Bank’s safeguard policies.
                 The 2004 PAD classified the project as environmental Category FI, which was
                    obviously not adequate taking into account the type of activities supported; the
                    2008 PP rightly corrected this classification to Category B. Individual
                    investments underwent environmental screening and only activities classified as
                    Category B or C were supported under the project. The Environmental
                    Management Plan (EMP) framework developed during project preparation
                    outlined main principles applicable, listed expected environmental issues and their

                                                     14
           mitigation measures common to individual investments, and provided guidance
           on screening, categorization, review, and scoping of the specific environmental
           work required for handling individual activities.
          The EMP framework was not accurately followed during earlier stages of project
           implementation: individual investment activities were not screened and classified
           and site-specific EMPs were not developed. But after this shortfall was flagged
           by Bank supervision teams, the quality of environmental monitoring of works and
           related record-keeping improved markedly. Following newly introduced national
           requirements, an entity licensed for carrying out technical supervision of civil
           works was commissioned and tracking environmental compliance was an integral
           part of its terms of reference (TOR). Overall, no major environmental issues were
           encountered, because of the small scale of works and good construction practice
           under the MWWP. Issues such as: (i) the maintenance of sanitary zones around
           head-works and hydraulic structures; and (ii) the handling of existing of asbestos
           cement roofing materials were addressed satisfactorily.
          OP/BP 4.11 was triggered to safeguard any chance finds may have been
           encountered during the earth works. No such cases were recorded.

36. Procurement
        Management contract. The award of the Management contract was a condition
          for Credit effectiveness. The Manager was selected after an open bidding process
          among four prequalified operating companies from France, Germany and Italy.
          The original Management contract was signed for four years with the possibility
          of a two-year extension. In fact the MWWP financed the Manager for seven
          years between end 2004 and end 2011 by reallocating savings on other
          components. In 2008 the mandate of the Manager was extended to include
          supervision of projects financed by other financing agencies. A two-year
          extension of the Management contract until end 2013 to be financed under the
          MWP has been recently granted after direct negotiations, that benefitted from
          Bank financed technical assistance, with the incumbent Manager.
        Construction, goods and consultant services. The MWWP financed a total or 26
          construction contracts (US$11.9 million), 80 contracts for the supply of goods
          (US$17.2 million), and 26 consultant contracts (US$20.7 million, of which close
          to US$17.0 million for the Management contract). A total of 77 contracts were
          subject to post review and 27 were actually reviewed. All construction contracts
          value at more than US$0.6 million and goods contracts valued at more than
          US$0.1 million were awarded after International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and
          subject to prior review. All consultant contracts valued at more than US$0.1
          million were awarded following the Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS)
          procedure.
        Bank Procurement Supervision.          The Bank carried regular procurement
          supervisions and rated the “compliance? and “performance? risks as “moderate?.
          Supervision reports never identified governance issues that could have adversely
          affected the procurement process.



                                           15
      37. Financial Management. The Bank closely supervised the FM performance of both the
      MWWP CMU and the AWSC. FM supervision missions have been carried out annually
      since 2005. Throughout project implementation, FM and counterpart funding, two key
      Implementation Supervision Report (ISR) indicators have consistently been rated satisfactory
      (marginally satisfactory for the August 2005, however).
              MWWP CMU. Financial management arrangements – including planning and
                 budgeting, accounting, internal controls, funds flow, financial reporting and
                 external audits – have consistently been rated satisfactory. The level and
                 timeliness of GOA co-financing have also been satisfactory. The financial
                 management reports (FMRs) were received on time and mostly acceptable to the
                 Bank. The auditors expressed unmodified (clean) opinions of the project’s
                 financial statements (also received on-time) and raised no major issues in their
                 management letters. The CMU internal controls were adequate. The controls over
                 operating expenditures were also regularly reviewed and found to be adequate.
              AWSC. The restructuring of AWSC balance sheet aimed at shielding the
                 company from debt accumulated prior to the Management contract was finally
                 resolved in May 2008. Auditors have issued the following opinions on the
                 AWSC financial statements: (i) unmodified (clean) opinions for 2009 and 2010;
                 (ii) qualified exceptions for 2007 and 2008; (iii) qualified disclaimers on 2005 and
                 2006. Audit reports have usually been received by due dates. In their latest
                 report available (May 2011) auditors expressed “doubt about the ability of AWSC
                 that had accumulated large financial losses in recent years, to continue as a
                 going concern?. In June 2011 the Bank, that systematically emphasized
                 weaknesses identified in audit reports while acknowledging their receipts,
                 specifically requested the preparation of a time bound action plan for
                 implementing the recommendations of the auditor’s management letter of May
                 2011. This action plan was not available for review at the closing of the MWWP.
                 Also, the PAD for the follow-up MWP does not include a summary of AWSC
                 past audited financial statements and a forecast of its likely future financial
                 situation.3
              Financial Covenants. AWSC has been in compliance with the financial covenant
                 of not incurring any debt, unless its net revenues are at least 1.5 times its
                 estimated maximum debt service requirement for any succeeding fiscal year. But,
                 as already mentioned, this was possible only because operating subsidies
                 regularly extended by the GOA.

    In a Sector Development Policy Letter of 2011, the GOA commits to increasing tariffs by 2014.

2.5.Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

    38. The Future of the Management Contract. The Management contract that started in
    October 2004 and ended late in 2011 has significantly improved the quality of the WW
    service and succeeded in changing AWSC corporate culture. It has recently been extended
    until end 2013 and is now referred to as an “Enhanced Management Contract – EMC? that
    mandates the Manager to prepare a “Total Management Plan – TMP? for AWSC in addition
    to managing the company. The Municipal Water Project (MWP) approved in February 2012
    will finance this extension. Altogether the Management contract would have been supported
    by external financing for a period of nine years.

    39. The Lease Contract Option. The GOA, eager to pursue its successful PPP experience,
    envisaged evolving the Management contract into a “Lease? contract similar to what has
    been successfully implemented in Yerevan since 2006. But AWSC poor financial situation
    and limited future cash generation capacity have caused this move to be postponed. In a
    Lease, collections would have to be sufficient to cover the Operator’s costs, including that of
    its foreign professional partner, and to generate cash surpluses to service the debt and
    contribute to the CAPEX. Also, because the Operator would take the operational and
    commercial risks, its shareholders would have to finance the working capital. The feasibility
    of a Lease contract for AWSC operations would greatly depend upon future GOA tariff,
    subsidy and financing strategies, as discussed below.4 If the GOA decides to move towards
    a Lease contract, it would be highly beneficial to transform the AWSC into an Asset Holding
    Company (AHC), owner or concessionaire of the WW fixed assets and responsible for the
    financing of their development. The AHC would be the signatory party to the Lease and the
    end beneficiary of funds made available to the GOA by its international partners and would
    issue consolidated financial statements of the WW operations.

    40. Tariff Strategy. Before deciding on the PPP to be implemented after 2013, the GOA
    should first clarify if the WW tariff to be charged to AWSC customers would eventually be
    set to generate revenue sufficient to: (i) simply cover O&M costs; (ii) cover O&M costs,
    contribute cash to the CAPEX and cover loan principals and interests; or (iii) cover O&M
    costs, depreciate fixed assets and yield a return on assets to cover interest on debt and return
    on equity invested.5

    41. Subsidy Strategy. The customer “willingness-to-pay? and the GOA “willingness-to-
    charge? are likely to set the upper limits to future tariff increases. The GOA may be
    unwilling to charge customers living in small towns and villages a much higher tariff than
    that applying in Yerevan, where households are reported to have much higher incomes.
    Addressing the “equity? objective of WW pricing raises the issue of uniformity of the WW
    tariff throughout the country and thus that of the rationale for having several utility

4
  There are examples of Leases successfully implemented in cases where tariffs were originally insufficient to cover
O&M costs: the best documented one is that of the Guinea (Conakry) Lease that started in 1989 (with SAUR and
Veolia as foreign partners of the locally incorporated Lease Operator). The Guinean Government agreed to
gradually increase the Customer tariff from a level sufficient to cover only about two thirds of O&M costs to a level
sufficient to cover O&M, depreciation and financing costs over a ten-year period.
5
  These three options are usually translated in financial covenants of Bank Loans or IDA Credits.

                                                         17
companies providing the WW service. It also raises the issue of subsidies, ideally to be
transparent, targeted and time limited, three criteria that are not met by operating subsidies
currently extended to AWSC. When it comes to the design of subsidies and cross-subsidies,
there are several successful, or less successful, examples the GOA could look at before
deciding which arrangements would best serve its objectives.

42. Financing Strategy. Current estimates for the future CAPEX outside of Yerevan are in
the range of US$1,000 million for the coming 20 years, of which about US$75 to US$100
million for the coming five years. So far, AWSC has been able to secure financing for a total
of about US$140 million from various financing agencies, of which a total of US$58 million
from the Bank, including the recently approved MWP. In the absence of significant GOA
budget contributions and commercial debt financing in local currency on terms adapted to the
WW sector, which depreciates its assets over long periods, the rehabilitation and renewal of
AWSC infrastructure is likely to remain highly dependent upon the availability of external
financing in the near future.
        AWSC borrowing. AWSC, which does not yet recover its operating costs from
            collected user charges and is, according to the latest available audit report, at risk
            of bankruptcy should not be allowed to borrow until it generates cash surpluses
            from sales revenues and it has been recapitalized to make up for its large
            accumulated losses. Until this has happened, GOA financing to AWSC should
            preferably be extended on grant terms.
        Foreign exchange risk. AWSC that generates revenues in AMD cannot bear the
            foreign exchange risk: heavily regulated WW sectors have faced major financial
            crisis when having to cope with rapid or brutal foreign exchange variations, as
            was the case in Argentina in the early 2000s. When the GOA raises funds in
            foreign currencies, it should preferably on-lend them to AWSC in local currency,
            and add a premium on the interest rate (when AWSC is allowed to borrow) for
            mitigating the foreign exchange risk.
        Affordable CAPEX and financing plan. AWSC challenge is to identify a
            medium-term CAPEX that would be affordable taking into account constraints set
            by: (i) politically acceptable tariff increases; (ii) realistic future efficiency gains;
            (iii) limited debt servicing capacity; and (iv) GOA limited resources for grant
            financing. This can only be done by regularly updating a detailed financial
            forecast of AWSC operations.

43. Non-Revenue-Water Reduction Strategy. The PAD mentioned the abnormally high
level of unaccounted-for water (UfW), a notion now replaced by that of non-revenue water
(NRW), a legacy of wasteful past practices. Neither the PAD nor the Management contract
specifies NRW reduction targets either. The CMU Implementation Completion Report
(Annex 6) mentions that water losses (NRW) evolved from about 74 percent in 2004 to 83
percent at end 2011. The NRW increase under MWWP does not translate a deterioration of
the performance: (i) physical losses increase proportionally to the duration of the service; and
(ii) expressing NRW as a percentage of the production is often misleading when
consumption decreases as a result of successful demand management programs based on




                                              18
    metering and pricing.6 AWSC estimates that half of NRW is due to physical leaks, and half
    to commercial losses. i.e., faulty individual meters and water theft through illegal
    connections.
              Limiting physical losses on the public distribution network would require the
                gradual replacement of aging and poor quality distribution pipes, a very large
                investment that may not be economically justified, now that energy consumption
                has been significantly reduced by substituting gravity water sources to pumped
                ones.
              Limiting physical losses located on internal distribution networks of apartment
                buildings would require a revision of the condominium legislation, an action that
                is probably beyond what public and private parties involved in the WW sector
                could achieve.
              In the absence of an updated condominium legislation, limiting commercial losses
                would require replacing all existing poor quality meters located in each unit of
                apartment buildings and currently belonging to customers by accurate anti-
                magnetic class C meters preferably with remote reading equipment that would
                then be the property of the WW utility company; this is probably a project that
                could be carried out by AWSC.
    Reducing NRW to internationally accepted levels of 20 percent and below may not be a
    realistic objective in the medium-term for AWSC, and before deciding on the next PPP
    model, it would be beneficial to develop a NRW reduction strategy justified by further
    energy savings and potential environmental gains for “managing expectations? of all parties.


    3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1.Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
    44. Objectives. The original PDOs of improving the quality of the water supply service
    provided to customers and AWSC sustainability remain relevant in 2012. Increasing hours
    of water service, improving drinking water quality, achieving greater operating efficiency,
    improving customer relations, are still very high on the GOA agenda. The PDO for the
    MWP approved in 2012 is still “to support improvement of the quality and availability of
    water supply in selected service areas of the AWSC?. Other objectives pursued by the
    original MWWP of “increasing cash generation through reform of billing and collection and
    closer alignment of service tariffs? are also relevant, but they are not listed in the PDOs of
    the MWP.

    45. Design. The original project design remains relevant for future support to AWSC
    activities. Injecting know-how by a professional Operator placed in line positions for
    changing the culture of a WW utility company and linking part of its remuneration to the
    performance of the company obviously has to be continued, either under a Management or
    under a Lease contract. Also, engaging an independent technical auditor for monitoring the

6
 It is preferable to express NRW in liters per day per connection or liters per day per km of distribution
pipe.

                                                     19
   performance of the Manager or Operator provides guarantees that data available are
   reasonably accurate.
   However, financing a Management contract from an external source creates an unhealthy
   “dependency? situation: the MWP has recently been approved primarily for avoiding a gap in
   the financing of the Management contract. The MWWP should have set a clear deadline for
   ensuring the coverage of the Manager’s costs from sales revenues. Also, by focusing
   exclusively on technical indicators and by not reconciling the latter with data available from
   audited financial statements (Table 2), the monitoring of the progress achieved by AWSC
   could not be comprehensive and red flags could not be raised timely.

   46. Implementation. The MWWP implementation arrangement remains relevant to future
   projects with AWSC. AWSC should remain fully responsible for identifying, justifying,
   preparing and implementing rehabilitation projects; it could also become responsible for
   paying contractors. If the GOA decides to evolve the PPP into a Lease contract and evolve
   the role of AWSC into that of an AHC, it would then be necessary to clarify the breakdown
   of responsibilities between the AHC and the Lessee when it comes to implementing the
   CAPEX.

3.2.Achievement of Project Development Objectives. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

   47. Quality of Service Improvement Objective. The project objective of improving the
   quality of water supply service has been achieved, and sometimes exceeded:
            Constancy of water service. The weighted average of daily hours of drinking
               water services increased from 6.0 hours at end 2004 to 15.0 hours at end 2011, a
               figure to be compared with a target of 15.0 hours set in the Management contract
               for the latter date. 94 percent of cities and towns in AWSC service areas now
               receive minimum hours of service (end 2011 target was 90 percent).
            Bacteriological water quality. The percentage of water samples in compliance
               with bacteriological safety requirements increased from 93.8 percent in 2004 to
               98.2 percent in 2011 (end 2011 target was 98.1 percent).
            Metering ratio. The percentage of individual subscribers billed on the basis of
               metered consumption increased from 40.2 percent in 2004 to 82.2 percent in 2011
               (end 2011 target was 77.8 percent).
   The achievement of this PDO can thus be rated highly satisfactory.

   48. Sustainability Objective. Even if AWSC debt service coverage ratio covenant has been
   complied with, no significant progress has been made on achieving the objective of
   improving its sustainability. Estimates of the NVP and FIRR of future AWSC cash flows,
   using the total project cost as outflow and the total of collections and operating subsidies as
   inflows are of minus US$3.6 million for a discount rate of 12 percent and minus six percent
   respectively. Appraisal estimates were plus US$12.5 million and plus 14 percent
   respectively. As the NPV and FIRR of the project are good indicators of the sustainability of
   AWSC operations, the achievement of this PDO is rated unsatisfactory.

   49. As highlighted in Annex 3, AWSC still relies heavily of GOA subsidies to cover its
   operating and management costs.

                                               20
                 Throughout the project period AWSC has received subsidies that represented
                  about 30 percent of its total revenues. In 2010, for meeting its cash operating
                  expenses from its collection, AWSC would have needed billings – and thus an
                  average tariff – about 50 percent higher than what it achieved.
                 AWSC accounts receivable equivalent to about 205 days of billing as of end 2010
                  resulted from a combination of improved collection performance from 48 to 90
                  percent between 2005 and 2010 and a provision for impairment of receivable.
                 Because of increasing accumulated losses AWSC equity has been eroded from the
                  equivalent of US$56.3 to 2.6 million between 2004 and 2010. AWSC that has
                  been able to mobilize about is a highly leveraged company with a ratio of total
                  liabilities to shareholder equity that increased from 1.0 in 2005 to 11.1 in 2010.
                 In their 2010 report, the Auditors mentioned that “it is possible that the
                  Company’s total liabilities will exceed total assets at year end of 2011? a matter
                  the “may cast significant doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a
                  going concern?. The time bound action plan requested by the Bank was not
                  available at the time of closing of the MWWP. Obviously AWSC is at risk of
                  defaulting on its loan payments in the near future.

    50. Overall the efficacy of the project is rated moderately satisfactory on the ground that both
    PDOs, i.e., service quality improvement and AWSC financial sustainability were given an
    equal weight in the PAD and PP.7


3.3.Efficiency. Rating: Satisfactory

    51. Economic Benefits. The PAD anticipated reduced energy consumption, time saved
    fetching water, avoided coping costs and reduced incidence of water borne diseases as the
    main economic benefits of the project. A comprehensive estimate of the project ERR could
    not be carried out because of the lack of quantitative data on the situation, costs and
    monetized benefits at the beginning and completion of the project.
            Energy savings. Overall electricity consumption was reduced by 40 percent
              between 2004 and 2010; assuming that investment in Branch systems (a total of
              US$24.45 million) were mostly designed to save energy, the NPV of this project
              component can be estimated at US$0.8 million for a discount rate of 12 percent
              and the ERR at 14 percent. These figures are likely to be on the low side, as not
              all investments in Branch systems were directly targeted at saving energy.
            Improved commercial operations. The main quantifiable economic benefit of the
              Management contract, for which US$16.85 million have been invested, has been
              the improvement of the commercial operations evidenced by increased collections
              from customers and thus a reduced need for operating subsidies. Assuming that
              the collection ratio would have remained at its original 42 percent without the

  If the “quality of service? objective is rated “highly satisfactory? and given a 6, and the “sustainability? objective is
rated “unsatisfactory? and given a 2, the average efficacy rating can be estimated to be 0.5 x 6 + 0.5 x 2 = 4
equivalent to a “moderately satisfactory? rating.

                                                            21
              Management contract, the NPV of this component for a 12 percent discount rate is
              estimated to be just about zero and the ERR 12 percent
             Time saving. The PAD estimated that the equivalent of one person-hour per day
              per household was spent fetching water at the beginning of the project. While
              improved quality of the water service is likely to affect all customers, those who
              were relying on standpipes and were connected under the project are likely to
              have benefitted most. However, this benefit is likely to be pretty low in monetary
              terms.
             Coping Costs. The PAD suggested that improved quality of service and water
              quality would reduce household coping costs, related to booster pumps, individual
              storage tanks, household disinfection equipment, water boiling or purchase of
              bottled water. While these objectives have largely been achieved, available data
              do not allow concluding on the value if coping costs avoided.
             Reduction in Incidence of Water Borne Diseases. The end-line sociological report
              (Annex 5) mentions that water borne diseases affected 1.5 percent of households
              in 2011, a figure to be compared to two percent before 2006. This economic
              benefit could however not be valued.


3.4.Justification of the Overall Outcome Rating

             Overall rating: Moderately Satisfactory
             Relevance: Moderately Satisfactory
             Achievement of the PDOs: Moderately Satisfactory
             Efficiency: Satisfactory

   52. Overall, the project outcome is rated moderately satisfactory, based on the mix of ratings
   for relevance, efficacy and efficiency justified above.

3.5.Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts.

   53. The subsidization of installation cost of residential meters was the MWWP only
   component specifically targeted at improving the WW service to low income households and
   reducing the burden of water expense on their budgets. It was successfully implemented and
   about 2,000 households did benefit from this financing scheme.

   54. The project did include any activity aimed or at addressing specific gender issues. It may
   be noted however that women, who traditionally are the main users of water for carrying out
   domestic tasks and responsible for coping with a poor water service are likely to be the main
   beneficiaries of a project that essentially focused on improving the reliability of the water
   service

3.6.Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey

   55. The beneficiary survey of December 2011 (Annex 5) collected data from a representative
   sample of 400 households in 14 primary sampling units representing regional cities covered

                                                22
by the project. Overall, 74 percent of the respondents thought that the management of the
WW service improved between 2004 and 2011, 21 percent said that it remained the same and
five percent believed that it worsened.
         Constancy of the water supply service. 76 percent of households reported an
           improvement in the constancy of the service since 2004, against 18 percent that
           said that it remained about the same. 42 percent of customers reported a service
           of 21 to 24 hours per day and still 46 percent a service of less than 12 hours per
           day. There was a difference between household expenditure quartiles: average of
           13.4 hours for the lower quartile vs. 15.9 hours for the higher quartile.
         Water quality. All categories of customers mentioned a perceived improvement
           of the water quality. The survey highlighted a modest increase of consumption of
           bottled water between 2004 and 2011, mostly in case of perceived bad quality of
           piped water. However, 80 percent of respondents mention that they never
           purchase bottled water.
         Customer service. 43 percent of customers expressed their satisfaction with the
           response time to problems signaled to AWSC, a noticeable improvement over the
           2004-2011 period
         Tariff. While 43 percent of households considered that the current level of the
           water bill was adequate, 40 percent considered it to be “rather high? and 17
           percent “very high?, even if it represents only a small fraction of household
           budgets: (i) lower quartile: average monthly bill AMD1,537 for a household of
           4.3 people (US$3.9/month/household), or about 1.9 percent of the total monthly
           household spending; (ii) higher quartile: average monthly bill AMD1,775 for a
           household of 2.7 people (US$4.5/month/household), i.e., only about 0.6 percent
           of the total monthly spending.



4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

          Rating: Substantial

56. Technical. This risk is rated moderate. The MWWP mostly supported the rehabilitation
of existing WW facilities, the establishment of good operating practice and the improvement
of commercial operations and customer services with the main objectives or reducing
production and distribution costs and increasing sales revenues. The risk that future
construction activities be not focused on a similar agenda is low because the MWWP
succeeded in changing the culture of the company. However future progress is linked to
GOA capacity to pursue a PPP option: the risk of having to terminate the Management
contract because of shortage of external funds is substantial until AWSC operating revenues
are sufficient to finance it and the Manager is comfortable with associated risks, such as the
foreign exchange risk.

57. Financial. This risk is rated substantial. AWSC still is highly dependent on GOA
operating subsidies to survive and external funds to finance its Manager. A major tariff
increase should be considered just to cover operating costs from collection. Future major

                                           23
tariff increases would have to be considered once an agreement has been reached on the
future pricing and financing strategies of the WW sector. At the completion of the MWWP,
it is not clear how the GOA would address these issues. Further efficiency gains for
increasing billing, collection and reducing operating costs would not be sufficient to improve
AWSC financial situation.

58. Economic. This risk is rated substantial. The economy of the WW sector may need to
be reassessed now that the culture of its key actors has changed and that significant
operational progress has been achieved by the various PPPs. The key issue to be addressed
should obviously be: how to finance future WW programs? Key parameters to be taken into
account should be: (i) principles for resetting tariff levels and structures; (ii) the uniformity or
disparity of WW tariffs between Yerevan, secondary cities and villages; (iii) the rationale for
geographical cross-subsidies and as a consequence for operating several WW utility
companies; and (iv) the “affordable? mix of cash generation, long-term debt and
development grants for financing the “affordable? CAPEX.

59. Social. This risk is rated substantial. Even if there are some examples within AWSC
service area of tariff adjustments that have recently been possible after the quality of service
improved, and even if Annex 5 shows that household WW expenses are currently below the
usually accepted threshold of four percent of the total household spending, major tariff
increases are likely to face significant resistance: almost 60 percent of respondents to
beneficiary surveys mentioned that the tariff was already “rather high? or “very high?. An
issue to be addressed rapidly is the design of targeted subsidies for protecting low income
households against high WW bills.

60. Political. This risk is rated moderate. Even if reaching a consensus on pricing, subsidies
and financing strategies among the many stakeholders involved in the WW sector is likely to
be a complex exercise, the already mentioned cultural change introduced by the MWWP is
unlikely to be overturned, even in case of major political changes.

61. Environmental. This risk is rated moderate. Activities aimed at limiting energy and
water consumptions can only have a beneficial impact on the environment. However the
unusually high water consumption and NRW levels in most cities affect the proper operation
of wastewater treatment plants because they translate into low concentration of the effluents
discharged.

62. Government Ownership. This risk is rated moderate. Even if the GOA has hitherto
taken major steps for modernizing its WW sector, there is always a risk that a government
ideologically opposed to PPP in the provision of an essential public service decides not to
extend the Management contract or not to evolve it into a Lease contract with an “expensive
foreign operator?. Successful PPPs implemented in similar situations have usually been
based on a gradual transfer of managerial responsibilities to local staff and of partial
ownership of the operating company to local private interests. It is felt that even if the GOA
opts for not extending the PPP experience, the cultural change introduced by the latter is
likely to have a long lasting effect, even if financial incentives may no longer be the main
engine for improving performance.

                                              24
   63. Other Stakeholder Ownership. This risk is rated moderate. The service quality
   improvements achieved by the MWWP have been heavily predicated upon the good
   performance of the PPP and in particular that of AWSC Manager. As long the Management
   contract can be financed, the Manager is likely to remain in business. But as already
   mentioned the dependency upon external funds to finance operating costs has become
   addictive and thus unhealthy.

   64. Governance. The risk is rated moderate. The decision to extend the Management
   contract or to evolve it into a Lease contract would have to be taken soon after consultation
   with all stakeholders, including potential private partners. The procedure to be followed for
   selecting the future private partner would also have to be agreed upon at that stage. If an
   open bidding process is likely to be acceptable to most parties, it always carries the risk of
   having to select an operator with limited experience or interest in the operation, simply
   because it submitted the lowest bid. Direct negotiation with a preferred partner is an option
   that should not be discarded; it would however require a mechanism for ensuring
   transparency and fairness of the process. Reducing petty fraud by customers (manipulation
   of meters) and petty corruption by service provider agents (manipulation of meter readings)
   could be achieved by the combination of improved technology (anti-magnetic class C meters
   equipped with remote reading equipment) and contractual implicit or explicit incentives to
   increase billing and collection.

   65. Natural Disaster Exposure. The risk is rated moderate, even if the country is located in
   a highly seismic area.



   5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance


5.1.Bank Performance

      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

   66. Bank Performance: Quality at Entry. There was no Quality at Entry (QAE) Panel for
   this project held after appraisal. At completion the QAE can be rated moderately
   satisfactory. If the Bank opted for supporting a simple and well-focused project and a PPP
   model that was well adapted to issues to be addressed, it twice missed the chance of putting
   the AWSC on the path of financial sustainability by not preparing financial forecasts of its
   operations and by selecting inadequate financial covenants. The project closes with an
   AWSC that is highly dependent on operating subsidies and has no clear action plan for
   moving towards financial sustainability.

   67. Bank Performance: Quality of Supervision. A Quality of Supervision Assessment
   (QSA) Panel carried out in 2006 rated the overall Bank supervision effort as “satisfactory?
   and the adequacy of supervision inputs and processes as “highly satisfactory?. This Panel

                                              25
   also rated the QAE “satisfactory?. At completion, the QSA can be rated moderately
   satisfactory. Indeed, the Bank: (i) ensured that AWSC delivered quality construction on time
   and within budget and complied with fiduciary and safeguards requirements; (ii) issued well
   documented aide memoires with detailed annexes on procurement, financial management
   and environmental protection issues; and (iii) provided a highly valued assistance to the
   implementing agency. But the Bank supervision effort should have been strengthened by the
   regular updating of medium-term forecasts of AWSC financial statements to help identify
   potential up-coming problems and help support requests for tariff adjustments or equity
   injection in the Company.

5.2.Borrower Performance

      Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

   68. The Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory. Even if the GOA was able
   to implement a reform of WW operations outside of Yerevan and deliver a quality project on
   time and within budget and to comply with fiduciary and safeguards requirements, it is
   partially responsible for not taking actions for putting AWSC on the path of financial
   sustainability.




                                             26
   6. Lessons Learned


6.1.Positive Lessons

   There are several positive lessons that can be drawn from the design and implementation of
   the MWWP.

   69. Government Commitment. As earlier mentioned in the PICR of the MDP, the GOA
   commitment to reforming the WW sector proved to be the key factor for the successful
   aspects of the project. The last Bank supervision aide-memoire (December 2011)
   highlighted that political support has been present at all times during project implementation.
   The SCWE, the key stakeholder in the WW sector, considers that Armenia, a country where
   most WW services now are operated under three different PPPs, is becoming a model for the
   region.

   70. Quality of the Manager. When the outcome of a WW project depends highly upon the
   performance of the Manager of the utility company that implements it, it is essential to: (i)
   mobilize a reputable international operator; (ii) ensure that the conditions of the Management
   contract are acceptable to all stakeholders; and (iii) establish a true “partnership? between
   public and private parties. The MWWP has achieved these three conditions. The Bank last
   supervision aide-memoire noted that:
           The MWWP objective of establishing a partnership between the GOA and a
              private operator for improving service quality and transferring knowledge has
              been successfully met: institutional capacity has been built for enabling local staff
              to operate AWSC in the future, as well as other Armenian WW utility companies;
           The most important achievement of the MWWP has been to provide WW services
              to a population that had lacked them for more than twenty years, a result that
              could have not been achieved without the partnership with the Manager; and
           The MWWP has succeeded in developing the capacity of the PMU to monitor
              performance of WW utilities and to become a GOA unit able to identify and
              prepare future PPPs and interact with private partners in other sectors.

   71. Autonomy of the Manager. The last supervision aide-memoire also noted that a key
   element of the successful PPP has been the autonomy and independence granted by the GOA
   to the Manager, even if monitoring and control functions still have to be strengthened to
   cause the latter meet its contract obligations. This Manager was able: (i) implement an
   independently designed investment plan; (ii) take some commercial risk; and (iii) properly
   manage financial resources available and even to contribute some working capital.

   72. Partnership with the Bank. The quality of the partnership between the public and
   private partners and the financing institution(s) that support it is essential for ensuring
   achievement of the PDOs. The decentralization of Bank supervision responsibilities, in
   particular that related to procurement, financial management and environmental protection
   has proven to be highly beneficial. The locally based Bank team has played a key role in
   ensuring that Bank guidelines are properly understood, and complied with.

                                               27
6.2.Other Lessons

   There are several other lessons that can be drawn from the MWWP experience.
   73. The Bank should act as a Bank. PADs for WW projects implemented by revenue-
   earning utility companies should answer two key questions in the following order: (i) who
   are we lending to? and (ii) what are we lending for? The 2004 PAD and 2008 PP provided a
   sufficiently clear answer to the second question by justifying the project with estimates of its
   NPV and ERR. In order to fully answer the first question, it would have been necessary to
   prepare a realistic medium-term financial forecast of AWSC operations, agree on an action
   plan for gradually moving towards recovery of O&M costs (and later capital costs) phasing
   out operating subsidies, maintaining accounts receivable to a reasonable level and ensuring
   sufficient funding of the Company and to covenant it in a PA. A PAD should also clearly
   identify issues, propose solutions to address them and ensure full consistency between its
   content and that of the legal documents; as highlighted above, there were several
   inconsistencies between the MWWP PAD and its legal documents.

   74. Tailoring Financial Covenants to Issues to be addressed. The Bank last supervision
   aide-memoire (December 2011) rightly noted that GOA still had to make significant progress
   to allow tariff adjustments and AWSC recover its O&M costs from sales revenues, reduce its
   dependence on operating subsidies and become a sustainable utility company. Obviously,
   requesting AWSC, a public company that should have not been allowed to borrow in the first
   place, to comply with a debt service coverage covenant was unlikely to help achieve these
   objectives. Adapted covenants should have been included in the legal documents to cause
   GOA and AWSC: (i) generate sales revenues sufficient to gradually recover operating costs
   by increasing tariffs; and (ii) limit accounts receivable by further improving collection
   performance and allowing provisions for unrecoverable arrears.

   75. PDOs should be more Strategic. The performance of a WW service eventually has to be
   assessed against reliability, efficiency, financial and environmental sustainability and
   affordability criteria.
           Reliability: the MWWP made good progress at improving the reliability of the
               WW service and there is no doubt that it is its major achievement;
           Efficiency: the MWWP made progress at reducing energy consumption and the
               staffing ratio and improving the metering and collection ratios, but with NRW
               above 80 percent, it cannot be claimed that AWSC is yet an efficient water
               operation;
           Financial sustainability: the MWWP obviously failed on this criteria – even in its
               most restrictive definition of recovering O&M costs from sales revenues –
               primarily as a result of inadequate design and selection of financial covenants;
           Environmental sustainability: the MWWP did not really address this issue beyond
               managing water demand through metering and reducing energy consumption; in
               particular, the MWWP did not attempt to address wastewater collection and safe
               disposal issues; and



                                               28
              Affordability: the MWWP addressed this issue by putting in place a revolving
               fund for residential meters and by maintaining WW tariffs at below cost recovery
               level.
    The MWWP illustrates well the inadequacy of the “common sense? approach that consists
    in first improving the quality of service and asking customers to pay cost recovery tariffs
    only when the service has improved. The quality of service has indeed improved in AWSC
    service area, but it is unlikely that GOA could raise the WW tariff by 50 percent or more to
    allow AWSC just recovering its cash operating costs from its collected user charges.

    76. The Need for Good Baseline Information. Economic justification of projects that
    mostly focus on rehabilitation of existing facilities and operations is always difficult
    without reliable data before and at the completion of the project. If energy savings are
    usually easy to identify, time savings, reduction of coping costs, health improvements and
    environmental improvements are much more difficult to document. Future projects should
    consider establishing good baseline information for better supporting estimates of
    economic benefits in an environment where the competition for financing is likely to
    remain strong.


   7. Comments on Issues raised by Borrower, Implementing Agencies and Partners.


7.1.Implementation of the CAPEX

   Annex 6 provides the draft Implementation Completion Report prepared by the CMU. In its
   section on lessons learned, it makes a few suggestions for improving the design of future
   projects. Bank comments are between brackets in the text below.

   77. Water Loss Management. The CMU proposal to focus more on water losses is fully
   justified taking into account the unusually high AWSC NRW performance.
            Commercial Losses. (The proposal of reducing commercial losses by replacing
               all poor quality individual meters owned by customers by class C meters owned
               by the AWSC placed in the public space is fully justified. As already mentioned,
               a revision of the condominium legislation, an issue that is probably beyond what
               the WW sector can address alone, would probably be a more practical solution: in
               most countries, the WW utility company meters the water consumed by the
               building, bills the condominium and leaves the building manager responsible for
               collecting payments from each apartment).
            Physical Losses. (Reducing physical losses for further reducing pumping costs
               and improving the operation of wastewater treatments is not mentioned by the
               CMU. The performance achieved by projects implemented in the three cities of
               Gyumri, Vanadzor and Armavir where aging distribution networks are replaced
               should be monitored and the ERR of such projects should be independently
               estimated to assess their replicability on a larger scale).




                                              29
78. Performance Indicators. The CMU suggests setting annual targets for a much larger set
of performance indicators than the four initially selected for calculating the bonus to be paid
to the Manager.
         Management contract. (There are a few examples of Management contracts that
          monitor a large numbers of indicators, but it has not been demonstrated that their
          performance is better than those that focus on a few key indicators. If the GOA
          opts for continuing the Management contract arrangement, the main indicator to
          monitor should probably be the working ratio and accounts receivable, and thus
          indirectly tariff adjustments and enforcement of disconnection procedures for
          non-payment).
         Lease contract. (If, as would be desirable, the GOA evolves the Management
          contract into a Lease contract, incentives to perform would be built in the contract
          itself: the Lease Operator would aim at maximizing its profit by reducing its
          operating costs by fixing physical leaks and increasing its billing and collection
          by improving its commercial procedures).

  A. AWSC Financial Performance
      1. This section of Annex 3 reviews the financial performance of the AWSC on the basis of
      its audited financial statements between 2004 and 2010; audited financial statements for 2011
      were not yet available at the time the PICR was prepared.

      Income Statements

      2. Reconstructed Income Statements. The presentation of the Statement of Comprehensive
      Income provided in the audit reports, by splitting expenses between cost of sales, distribution
      costs and management costs and combining cash and non-cash (depreciation) expenses that
      follow IFRS does not allow an easy monitoring of key components of the income statement
      of a WW utility. In the summary financial statements (Table 2 of this Annex), the income
      statements have been reconstructed as follows (using data for FY2010)

      3. AWSC Operating Revenues. AWSC billings have remained constant between 2004
      (AMD3,342 million) and 2010 (AMD3,487 million) equivalent to about US$9.0 million.
      Operating subsidies and other grants have represented a significant share of AWSC total
      operating revenues: between 2004 and 2010 they have totaled AMD10,490 million (US$26.8
      million) to be compared with total billing of AMD22,550 (US$57.7 million). Because no
      tariff adjustment is planned, AWSC forecasts the need for additional subsidies for the coming
      years, even more so that it will have to start repaying its long-term debt as of 2013.




                                                    33
4. AWSC Operating Expenses.
     a. Electricity expenses (16 percent of total operating costs in 2010), have declined
        by about 15 percent between 2004 and 2010, while the energy consumption
        decline by about 40 percent from 63.4 MWh in 2004 to 38.6 MWh, as result of
        the project;
     b. Staff costs (38 percent of total operating costs in 2010), have increased by 58
        percent (about eight percent per year) between 2004 and 2010 despite a staff
        retrenchment program aimed at improving the staffing ratio from 9.45 to
        6.0/1,000 connections. This increase, above an inflation rate of six percent per
        year, reflects change in the profile of staff employed by AWSC;
     c. The Management Contract (18 percent of total operating costs in 2010) whose
        costs have represented about 19 percent of the total operating expenses between
        the start of its operations (2005) and 2010;
     d. Other operating costs (27 percent of total operating costs in 2010) that regroup
        mostly maintenance and administrative expenses.

5. AWSC Net Income. Thanks to subsidies and grants received, AWSC has been able to
maintain positive earnings before interests, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).
However after deducting non-operating expenses (such as redundancy expenses or provision
for impairment of trade receivables) and adding non-operating revenues (such as foreign
exchange fluctuation) and after deducting depreciation and financing costs, AWSC has
generated a net loss in each of the years under review (Table 2 of this Annex).

6. AWSC Working Ratio. AWSC has been able to maintain a working ratio (operating
expenses divided by operating revenues) below 100 percent, meaning that the Company was,
in theory, able to recover its cash operating costs from its operating revenues. However this
ratio is a meaningful indicator only when bill collection is high. If AWSC bill collection
ratio has regularly improved, it was still 75 percent in 2007 and 90 percent in 2010. The
working ratio calculated excluding subsidies and grants has always been above 100 percent:
it was 128 percent in 2010. Assuming that: (i) other operating revenues, the collection ratio
and operating expenses remain at their current levels; and (ii) subsidies and grants are phased
out, AWSC billings should have been about 50 percent higher than their current level to
allow AWSC meeting its cash operating costs (excluding depreciation and financing costs)
from its cash collection. Of course, any future tariff adjustment would have be estimated on
the basis on the medium-term financial forecast of AWSC operations to reflect potential
efficiency gains in operating expenses, and affordable CAPEX and financing conditions.


Balance Sheets
7. AWSC Assets. AWSC assets were valued at AMD34,050 million (US$87.0 million) as
of end 2010, out of which fixed assets in operation represented AMD29,585 million
(US$75.7 million). AWSC poor collection performance in the earlier years of the period
under review has resulted in regularly growing accounts receivable that reached AMD7,180
million (US$18.3 million) in 2010, equivalent to 705 days of billing; this ratio has regularly
increased, from 205 days of billing equivalent in 2004. Since 2008, AWSC has provisioned


                                            34
large amounts for impairment of accounts receivable, and net accounts receivable represented
only 235 days (7.75 months) of billing in 2010.

8. AWSC Equity. As of 2010 AWSC share capital was AMD2,985 million (US$7.6
million). Because of regularly increasing accumulated losses valued at AMD17,385
(US$44.5 million) in 2010, i.e., an increase of about AMD10,000 million (US$25.6 million)
between 2004 and 2010, AWSC equity has steadily been eroded from AMD22,000 million to
AMD1,000 million (US$56.2 to US$2.6 million).

9. AWSC Liabilities. In addition to the two Credits granted by IDA for the MWWP (total
of US$43.0 million) and the recently approved Loan for the Municipal Water Project (US$15
million), AWSC has obtained financing from ADB (US$76 million) and EBRD (US$19
million). The weighted cost of borrowing is in the two percent range. As of end 2010
AWSC had used AMD24,475 million (US$62.6 million) of these loans; in addition AWSC
has received development grants from the GOA of AMD6,260 million (US$16.0 million).
Accounts payable, that reached about AMD2,200 million (US$5.6 million) in 2010, have
regularly increased from the equivalent of 90 days to 150 days of cash operating expenses
between 2006 and 2010.

10. AWSC Debt/Equity Ratio. AWSC is a highly leveraged company. The ratio of its total
liabilities to its shareholder equity has increased from 1.0 in 2005 to 11.1 in 2010, a value
that is way above what is usually accepted for water utility companies.

Cash Flow Statements

11. From Operating Activities. After adjustments, in particular for variations of working
capital, AWSC has always been able to generate a positive cash flow from operating
activities.

12. From Investing Activities. No comments.
13. From Financing Activities. AWSC had to contract short term loans from local banks in
2006 and 2008, but since their maturities were below 12 months, the debt service coverage
covenant of the IDA Credits did not apply. AWSC has paid interests on its long-term
borrowing since 2009, but repayment of AWSC long-term debt will not start in 2012. The
debt service coverage ratio (total of principal and interest payments divided by the EBIDTA
of the previous year) could thus only be calculated as of 2009. It has been slightly below the
agreed target of 1.4 in 2009 and above in 2010.


AWSC Financial Future

14. In their 2010 report, the Auditors mentioned that as result of large accumulated losses, “it
is possible that the Company’s total liabilities will exceed total assets at year end of 2011? a
matter the “may cast significant doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern?. Obviously AWSC is at risk of defaulting on its loan payments. The Company can

                                            35
   only service its debt to the GOA if it receives operating subsidies from the GOA and bear the
   foreign exchange risk if it receives compensations from the GOA. AWSC estimates that it
   will need an additional AMD1,875 million (US$4.8 million) to service its debt between 2012
   and 2014. Freezing AWSC debt service obligations until the Company is able to generate
   cash surpluses to service it and contribute to its CAPEX is an option to consider. However,
   only a detailed medium-term financial forecast of AWSC operations could help identify the
   combination of additional equity required and the affordable financing conditions for AWSC
   CAPEX taking into account constraints imposed by politically acceptable increases of the
   WW tariff and reductions (and hopefully phasing out) of operating subsidies and other
   grants. Preliminary (non-audited) AWSC financial statements for 2011 show a shareholder
   equity of AMD6,020 million (US$15.4 million) suggesting an equity contribution by SCWE.


B. Financial and Economic Analysis

   Financial Analysis

   15. An estimate of the project NVP and FIRR was carried out based on a 10-year projection
   of future AWSC cash flows, using the total project cost as outflow and the total of collections
   and operating subsidies as inflows. The NPV has been estimated at minus US$3.6 million
   for a discount rate of 12 percent and the FIRR at minus six percent. These figures would be
   lower if only collections form customers were used for estimating inflows. Appraisal
   estimates were plus US$12.5 million and plus 14 percent respectively.

   Economic Analysis

   16. The PAD anticipated reduced energy consumption, time saved fetching water, avoided
   coping costs and reduced incidence of water borne diseases as the main economic benefits of
   the project. A comprehensive estimate of the project ERR could not be carried out because
   of the lack of quantitative data on the situation, costs and monetized benefits at the beginning
   and completion of the project.
           a. Energy savings. Overall electricity consumption was reduced by 40 percent
               between 2004 and 2010; assuming that investment in Branch systems (a total of
               US$24.45 million) were mostly designed to save energy, the NPV of this project
               component can be estimated at US$0.8 million for a discount rate of 12 percent
               and the ERR at 14 percent. These figures are likely to be on the low side, as not
               all investments in Branch systems were directly targeted at saving energy.
           b. Improved commercial operations. The main quantifiable economic benefit of the
               Management contract, for which US$16.85 million have been invested, has been
               the improvement of the commercial operations evidenced by increased collections
               from customers and thus a reduced need for operating subsidies. Assuming that
               the collection ratio would have remained at its original 42 percent with the
               Management contract, the NPV of this component for a 12 percent discount rate is
               estimated to be about zero and the ERR 12 percent
           c. Time saving. The PAD estimated that the equivalent of one person-hour per day
               per household was spent fetching water at the beginning of the project. While

                                               36
    improved quality of the water service is likely to affect all customers, those who
    were relying on standpipes and were connected under the project are likely to
    have benefitted most. However, this benefit is likely to be pretty low in monetary
    terms.
   Coping Costs. The PAD suggested that improved quality of service and water
    quality would reduce household coping costs, related to booster pumps, individual
    storage tanks, household disinfection equipment, water boiling or purchase of
    bottled water. While these objectives have largely been achieved, available data
    do not allow concluding on the value if coping costs avoided.
   Reduction in Incidence of Water Borne Diseases. The end-line sociological report
    (Annex 5) mentions that water borne diseases affected 1.5 percent of households
    in 2011, a figure to be compared to two percent before 2006. This economic
    benefit could however not be valued.

Introduction

Background

For many years most of the water supply and sanitation systems in Armenia was in serious state
of disrepair; despite an abundance of water in the country, for almost all Armenians, water was
available for only a few hours a day. Over the past decade, the government of Armenia has
strived to improve access, reliability and quality of the drinking water and its infrastructure.
Although the water resource balance in many parts of the country has improved since the 1980s,
and despite the progress in improving water supply in areas supported by private sector
participation, the institutional framework for sustainable water supply delivery in most parts of
Armenia remained poor.

The project introduced a successful public/private partnership for the management of water and
wastewater services in AWSC service area, covering about 33 percent of the population. It has
delivered substantial results. Private sector participation is increasingly seen by the Armenian
government as a key component of sector reform strategies. Municipal Water and Wastewater
Project (MWWP) replicated the successful PPP model tested in Yerevan water sector. The
reform continues under Additional Financing, scaling up the rehabilitation and investments under
the MWWP.

In 2004, IDA provided US$23 million under Municipal Water and Wastewater Project, for the
areas outside Yerevan for improvement of water supply in terms of coverage, quality and cost.
To scale up the ongoing program of water system rehabilitation and improvements under the
MWWP project, in 2008 IDA provided Additional Financing of US$20 million. The closing date
was December 2011.

The current study aimed at assessing the level of achievement of the following KPIs set forth at
inception of the second phase of the project: (i) access to water and wastewater services; (ii)
duration of water supply; (iii) water quality; (iv) service quality by the utility, (v) water metering
and (vi) revenue collection. Additionally, the assignment aimed at describing the incidence of
benefits (access to water and wastewater services) among poor and non-poor households.

Methodology

The main data collection method was a representative sample survey of 400 households
implemented in the period of 10-20 December, 2011. The sample size allowed ensuring a margin
of error of 5% at 95% confidence level.

The sample was distributed proportionally among 14 Primary Sampling Units (PSUs)
representing regional cities covered by the project10, and the households in each city were

10
 The cities were selected from the list of all project sites with probability proportional to size and covered all
marzes of Armenia.

                                                          43
selected through a random route technique.11 In each household, the interview was conducted
with the most informed person.

The survey instrument was a structured questionnaire designed in collaboration with The World
Bank task team and pretested in one PSU (Abovyan city). Besides measuring the current
satisfaction with water and wastewater services, the questionnaire tried to capture the
respondents’ perceptions of their possible improvement or worsening over the past five years.

To measure benefit incidences among poor and non-poor households, the questionnaire included
a detailed section on household expenditures. The total monthly per capita expenditures were
then used to break down the achieved sample into quartiles, 1 representing the poorest
households. Table 1 below summarizes the data on monthly per capita spending of each of the
quartiles. Although the breakdown is based on reported expenditures, it is still believed that
estimates of expenditures are much less biased than estimates of incomes, and hence are better
proxies of household welfare.

Quartile 1     18,836                   2,500                     25,470
Quartile 2     32,270                   25,567                    38,958
Quartile 3     46,753                   39,417                    58,722
Quartile 4     95,866                   59,000                    337,917


When interpreting the findings it is necessary to consider, however, that while the survey was
quite representative in terms of allowing valid extrapolations to the general population, the
margin of error on quartile-level extrapolations was 10%.

Findings

Access to water and wastewater services

The survey reported that all 400 interviewed households had access to water and wastewater
services, thus suggesting that in December 2011 [close to] 100% of the households in project
sites were covered by the water service company (Saur).

While 14% of the respondents reported that they were not residing in their current place of
residence 5 years ago, the remaining 86% reported that they were using centralized water
services back in 2006 as well.


11
  With no access to the actual list of households (to which, in Armenia, only the National Statistical Service has
access), geographically stratified random route sampling is the only valid substitute.

                                                         44
Duration of water supply

The survey suggested that in the three months preceding the survey, 39% of the water users had
24-hour water supply (see Chart 1).

The average duration of water supply was estimated at 15 hours suggesting a 150% increase as
compared to the base value of 6 hours in 2004.

The survey suggested that the overall increase in the duration of water supply may have
benefited the poorest households the least, but considering the high margin of error the finding is
very tentative.

has improved as compared to 5 years ago, every fifth respondent thought it remained the same,
while 7% noticed a somewhat negative trend.

While quantifying the actual improvement was impossible due to possible recollection bias, the
survey suggested that poorer households may have witnessed somewhat less significant
improvement than better-off households.

Water quality

In the context of the survey, water quality was assessed through three indicators of taste, color
and smell. Considering that all categories, but especially taste, is very subjective, the respondents
were specifically asked to rate the provided water in relation to absence of unpleasant or strange
taste, rather than based on how much they like the taste.

To measure the improvement of the quality of water over since project inception, the respondents
were asked to rate the indicators now and [as best they can recall] five years ago. While the
indicators were rated separately using a 1-to-7 point rating scale (7=very good), the overall
quality was then assessed through averaging the three estimates.



                                                                  46
As shown in Chart 5 below, the results suggested that the quality of water has somewhat
improved in all aspects.

benefited the richer households, the findings regarding water quality suggested that the
improvement equally benefited poor and rich households.

The questionnaire included as well an indirect question regarding quality of water - inquiring
about consumption of bottled water in the household and the reasons for doing so. The fact of
consumption as such was not considered to be an indicator of bad water quality, but it may be
useful to know that over the past five years the proportion of households that often or sometimes
purchased bottled water for household consumption increased from 10% to 20%.

The survey established that quality related issues determined the decision to buy bottled water in
only 51% of cases (some attesting to respondents’ actual experience, while some relating to
perceptions), while the rest had to do with service failures or maintenance activities, special
needs and duration of water supply (see Chart 8).

Water safety

In the course of 2011, as evidenced by the respondents, water borne deceases affected 1.5% of
the households in AWSC service area. Prior to 2006, 2% of the respondents reported similar
incidences, suggesting improved bacteriological safety.

Both in 2011 and prior to project inception all respondents reported that medical treatment of the
deceases incurred additional costs [of 5,000 – 80,000 AMD in 2011].

Service quality by the utility



                                                               48
The data suggested that 35% of the households experienced water service failures in 2011 (the
percentage excludes internal system failures for which the utility is not responsible), each of the
households reporting an average of 2 such incidents. According to the respondents’ accounts, the
utility took care of the problem in an average of 37.8 hours.

While the survey suggested that the poor may have benefited somewhat less than the rich when it
came to continuity of water supply, the findings allowed assuming that the response time to
service failures was rather income indifferent.

Comparing these results with the respondents’ recollections regarding pre-project situation, the
survey suggested that a) the incidences of failures have significantly decreased (from 65% in
2006 to 35% in 2011; and b) the responsiveness of the utility has notably increased (see Chart
12).

As per the survey, 18% of water users in AWSC service area were aware that the utility had a
hotline, but only 4% of them (3 respondents) have contacted the hotline during 2011.
Water metering, tariffs and revenue collection

All 400 respondents reported to have a water meter installed in their households. The average
monthly household bill on water services was estimated at 1,663 AMD suggesting consumption
of approximately 10 m3 of water per month.



                                                    50
Remarkably, 93% of the respondents reported to have regularly paid their monthly bills without
any delays throughout the past year, suggesting that the end of project target of 95% may be
considered to be achieved. The remaining 7% reported to have paid with delays, and only 1
respondent said they never paid for the services.

 As far as the perceptions regarding the current tariff are concerned, 43% of the respondents
thought it was adequate, and only 17% thought it was very high.

To better understand the motives behind criticism, we asked all respondents who thought the
tariff was very high or rather high to explain their position. Thus, the majority of these
respondents (66%) reasoned their criticism by general comments pertaining to low incomes, 19%
thought that water is “Armenia’s own natural resource? and hence should not cost that much,
while 8% considered price-quality ratio and believed the tariff to be inadequate to the level of
service.

The survey suggested that 25% of the households would be ready to pay a higher price to get
better service quality (longer duration, better quality, less failures). When asked whether they
would have been ready to do so five years ago, 32% of the respondents said yes.

Although the absolute number of respondents who expressed willingness to pay more than they
currently do was quite small (only 96 respondents) and hence the estimate cannot be considered
reliable, it may be useful to know that they were ready increase their monthly spending by as
much as 46% to buy better service (from an average of 1,770 AMD to an average of 2,575
AMD).

Water system management

The overall satisfaction with water system management in AWSC service area was rated at 5.1
on a 1-to-7 point rating scale.

                            Implementation Completion Report

1. Introduction

The service area of Armenian Water and Sewerage Company (AWSC) includes 37 cities and 268
rural settlements.

The water supply to over 300 settlements is implemented through about 100 systems, 545 intake
structures, 2,500 km long water mains, 3,600 communal distribution networks, 45 pump stations,
380 daily regulation reservoirs (DRR), 109 chlorinating stations and 11 water treatment plants.
The wastewater disposal is implemented through about 1,900 km long sewerage collectors. There
are 13 sewerage treatment plants none of which is operational, and most of them cannot be
rehabilitated anymore.

Due to lack of funds in 1994-2000, the issues of water supply and wastewater disposal, system’s
sectorization, expansion and development of community networks, efficient distribution and
accounting of drinking water remained unsolved. The structures and pipelines of Water and
Wastewater (WW) system were highly deteriorated due to insufficient major rehabilitation and
maintenance activities, which was evidenced by high water losses and frequent failures of the
system. Prevention of the diseases caused by water contamination was a top priority issue.

Due to extremely low level of technical equipment and lack of control, measurement and
regulation devices and instruments and absence of special heavy equipment (only 10-15% of the
required items were available) maintenance activities were very inefficient and technological
processes were implemented at a very low level.

According to expert assessments, about 1,000 million USD of investments are required for
rehabilitation of AWSC system.

To address those issues, the Government of Armenia (GOA) has applied for a credit to
International Development Association.


2. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
a) Project Development Objectives

The major objective of Municipal Water and Water Project (MWWP, or Project) was to improve
the level of WW services within the service area of AWSC and increase Company’s operational
and managerial efficiency. Namely, to prevent future deterioration of the system, improve the
existing state, achieve the most efficient management through institutional reforms of water
supply and wastewater entities, satisfy increasing potable water demand of the population,

                                             53
organize water consumption accounting, improve financial state of the system and establish
favorable conditions for private investors. As a result, the following outcomes will be achieved:

    Technical - improved reliability and increased hours of service, improved water quality,
     greater operating efficiency and
    Commercial - improved relationships with customers; capable management and qualified
     staff; increased water company cash generation through reform of billing and collection,
     and closer alignment of service tariffs with costs, with a working ratio of 68 percent
     targeted for year four of the project.
    Investments – to have economically justified investments.

The aim of the Additional Financing (AF) for Municipal Water and Wastewater Project was to
enable AWSC to expand the on-going rehabilitation activities and investments. The project
development objective was the same as in original Project: to improve the quality of services
provided to customers in AWSC's service area and the sustainability of AWSC.

b) Project Preparation

A 1.195 million USD Project Preparation Facility (PPF) was provided to the GOA under
Agreement Q287-0 AM signed on September 18, 2001 between IDA and the Republic of
Armenia for preparation of the Project. The main objective of activities implemented by
consultants in 2002-2004 under PPF advance funding were the following:

      investigate economic, financial, legal, social and environmental aspects of the sector and
       the existing state of AWSC;
      Prepare Draft Management Contract and Bidding Documents for involvement of Private
       Sector Participation (PSP) through a tender.

A 15.4 million SDR (23.0 USD equivalent) credit was provided to Armenia for four years (2004-
2008) under Municipal Water and Wastewater Project Credit Agreement 3893AM signed between
GOA and IDA on June 14, 2004. The contribution of the GOA was 2.56 million USD.

The process for the involvement of a private manager in the management of operation and
maintenance of WW systems of AWSC started with a Management Contract tender
implemented in 2003-2004. 10 firms expressed interest to participate in the tender, and
proposals were received from four firms having extensive experience in European WW sector:
“GELSENWASSER AG? (Germany); the Consortium of “MVV Energy AG – AnfraMan
DmbH? (Germany, Austria); “RENCO spa? (Italy); and “SAUR S.A.? (France). An
Intergovernmental Committee was established under GOA Resolution No. 1172 dated
November 28, 2001 to ensure the preparation phase of the Project. By its Resolution No. 1444-N
dated October 30, 2003, the GOA assigned the Intergovernmental Committee to establish an
Evaluation Commission with the involvement of representatives from various ministries for
evaluation of results of the tender for transferring the powers of the Executive Body of AWSC to
a private manager. The Evaluation Commission evaluated technical and financial proposals of
the tender in January-April of 2004. SAUR S.A. was recognized the winning bidder. After

                                               54
signing the Credit Agreement, the Management Contract was signed with SAUR S.A. on August
19, 2004 under which the powers of the Executive Body of AWSC were transferred to
Management Contractor. The price of the proposal was 7.85 million Euro, 5.6 million Euro of
which for the period of 2004-2008, and 2.39 million Euro – for the period of 2009-2010
(including 0.14 million Euro for additional compensation – Contract Amendment, July 2009).

The activities provided under credit Project of 2004-2008 were completed by February 2009.

According to AF for MWWP and MWWP, the responsible entity for Project implementation is
the AWSC.

The highest level (strategic) governance and oversight of the Company will be carried out by
Company Management Board (CMB) chaired by the Chairman of State Committee for Water
Systems (SCWS). The SCWS is the owner of all stocks of the Company, and CMB Chairman
has signed the Management Contract on behalf of the GOA. All the stakeholding ministries are
presented in the CMB.

The monitoring and supervision of Project activities was assigned to the Contract Monitoring
Unit (CMU) of the State Institution of Water Sector Development and Institutional
Improvements Project Implementation Unit.

c) Outcome Indicators

As it is stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the Project sets the following Outcome
Indicators:

           Technical - improved service reliability; improved water quality; greater operating
            efficiency
           Commercial – improved relationships with customers; capable management and
            qualified staff, increased water company cash generation through reform of billing
            and collection, and closer alignment of service tariffs with costs, better cash flow and
            achievement of 68% working ration in Project year 4.
           Sector investments - all investments are economically justified and meet applicable
            safeguard policies.

23 Performance Indicators were set under Management Contract to evaluate the performance of
Management Contract. Right after commencement of the Contract, the Parties agreed to amend
them and the following indicators were removed:

a)       percent of block apartment buildings under contractual agreement with the company;

b)       average daily supply to distribution reservoir per equivalent registered inhabitant;

c)       amount of chlorine effectively used per equivalent inhabitant per year.


                                                  55
The following indicators were added:

a)        electricity specific consumption;

b)        percent of water disinfected.

The performance of Management Contractor was evaluated based on 21 performance indicators.
Meantime the Incentive Compensation payable to Management Contractor was calculated on the
basis of the following four indicators:



                                                                                                 Table 1

                                                                       Base

95,000 Euro Fixed Management Fee (VAT and profit tax excluded) was set for Project Year 7 under Management
Contract (October 2010 – October 2011). 150,000 Euro out of that amount is retained and
released at the end of the period based on the four Project Indicators calculated according to a
method similar to Incentive Compensation calculation in previous years.

Three Performance Indicators out of four remained the same: Continuity of Water Supply
Service (PI 1); Effectiveness of meters installation program (PI 2); Water Safety Compliance (PI
3), and the forth Performance Indicator was the Collection Ratio (PI 9) instead of Company’s
Operation Efficiency (PI 4, working ratio) used in previous years.



                                                   56
The improvement of those indicators should show the same trend as in the first six years of
Management Contract. Considering that the improvement of these indicators should be reviewed
for the period from October 11, 2010 to October 18, 2011, the following improvement
requirements were set:

      continuity of water supply service – 1 hour;
      effectiveness of meters installation program – 0.5%;
      water safety compliance 5%;
      collection ratio – 4%.

c) Revision of Project Development Objectives

It should be stated that the first phase of the Project has been implemented rather successfully.
Considerable improvements were achieved in the service area of AWSC under the 4-year
Management Contract signed with internationally experienced Management Contractor. Daily
supply hours were increased and water quality was improved, the number of metered
subscribers, revenue collection rate, working ration were increased. Water supply and
wastewater disposal systems were constructed and rehabilitated. The Company became more
manageable. However the GOA continuous its efforts to find out possible forms of cooperation
through the involvement of private sector in short-term and long-term future.

The MWWP was prepared for 6 years. The tender for Management Contract also was carried out
for 6 years (in phases: 4 years plus 2 years). Due to lack of funds the IDA provided only 23.0
million USD under Phase 1, and a 4-year contract was signed with Management Contactor. In
case of successful implementation of Phase 1, the Contract should have been extended by two
years according to Article 2.2 of General Conditions of Management Contract (with further
extension for another year).

In 2009 the GOA received Additional Financing from IDA in the amount of 12.8 million SDR
(20 million USD equivalent, Credit 4514AM) to scale up the ongoing program of water system
rehabilitation and improvements. The contribution of the GOA was 6.8 million USD. The
proposed additional financing was aimed at enhancing the sustainability, impact and
development effectiveness of the ongoing project, maximizing its development outcomes and
continuation of the institutional and financial capacity building of AWSC.

The Closing date is December 31, 2011.

3. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

a) Key factors affecting achievements and major drawbacks

The Management Contractor has made considerable efforts within 2004-2011 which resulted in
improvement of the system and better performance indicators. Meantime we think that these
indicators could have been even better if more practical approach was applied to some key
issues:

         i)      The duration of water supply services in the service areas of AWSC were 14.96
                 hours in September, 2011.

                 It should be stated that Appendix 9 of Management Contract has set a 24-hours
                 target for this indicator. Although the hours did increase, the target was achieved
                 only by 60%.

         ii)     The rate of metered subscribers was 81.2% (40% in 2004).

                 Nevertheless, the Company is still behind the schedule of individual customers’
                 Meter Installation Program. The delay of this process negatively impacts
                 Company’s revenues and collection rate.

                 The process of accounting of produced water is not completed yet. As a result, the
                 produced water and losses are not adequately accounted. Rehabilitation of meters
                 installed at all intakes and distribution points and their proper operation and
                 maintenance will clarify the volume of water taken from the source, transferred to
                 the distribution network and delivered to customers. That will also clarify the losses
                 and leaking points.

         iii)    Electricity consumption was 64.3 million KW-hours in 2004. That consumption
                 made up 38.6 million KW*hours in the last Project year (October 2010 – October
                 2010) through conversion of some pumping systems to gravity, installation of more


                                                    61
             efficient pumps in pump stations and implementation of rehabilitation activities in
             distribution networks (a reduction of 25.7 million KW*hours).
       iv)   Water losses have increased from 73.8% in 2004 (water consumption at that time
             was calculated mainly by per capita norms) to 82.7% in 2011 in spite of
             investments through WB, ADB, EBRD and USAID funding. In order to reduce
             losses, it is necessary to establish water accounting system and to continue the
             detection and elimination of illegal connections. That would enable more targeted
             use of investments and increase collection rate.
       v)    During 6 years of Management Contract it was consistently stated that the
             Company serves 170,000 subscribers (or about 60%) out of total number of
             270,000.

             The customers database has to be adapted. In our opinion it would be important to
             implement that process as it will specify the number of total and served customers,
             generated revenues, which in its turn will improve collection.

       vi)   During first 4 years of the Project 15 civil works contract were implemented for a
             total amount of 4.0 million USD. Following the Management Contractor’s
             suggestion, the technical and quality supervision of those works was carried out by
             the Company’s in house capacities.

             However the technical supervision was carried out by the Company with some
             shortcomings, and considerable additional efforts were required to eliminate the
             deficiencies which resulted in the delays of all contracts. Therefore the quality and
             technical supervision of the civil works implemented in Project years 5-7 were
             assigned to consultant firms selected through tender.

b) Key factors affecting Project preparation phase

A consultant firm (ICEA, France) with relevant international experience was selected in 2002 for
project preparation. The consultant had to investigate the financial, technical, economic,
organizational and legal status of the Company and recommend steps required for transferring
the system to a private management. The consultant had also to prepare bidding documents
(including draft Management Contract) and provide advise to the GOA on arranging the tender
and on the measures required for handing over the system to a private management.

The consultant prepared a report consisting of three parts based on the investigation results:

i)     Financial. This part presented the project scope, settlements covered by the project,
       economic and commercial state and problems.
ii)    Technical. This part described water systems, problems at the intake structures and
       distribution networks. This part also included preliminary proposals on the priority
       investment projects.
iii)   Legal-Organizational. This part presented the legal and organizational framework and its
       major problems. This part also discussed several alternative options for implementation

                                                62
         of MWWP and provided recommendations on Project management and institutional
         structure.

A draft Management Contract was also prepared, which was tendered internationally after
approval by the GOA. An Intergovernmental Commission was established with participation of
interested ministries for evaluation of tender results. The French SAUR S.A. firm was
recognized winning bidder.
c) Project Risks

The Project has set various risk ratings: High, Significant, Moderate and Low. The following
table presents high and significant risks of the Project.

                                                                                         Table 4

                                                    minimization. Support to condominiums
                                                    also is provided.

            may occur.


The World Bank and the GOA implemented various actions during entire Project
implementation to mitigate the risks.
d) Impact of Project Restructuring or of Other Significant Changes

There were several factors which enabled successful Project implementation, in particular:

i)       Financial assistance to water and wastewater sector by other donors. In addition to 43
         million USD credit funds provided by IDA, about 36 million USD was provided by
         ADB, 12 million USD - by EBRD and about 3 million USD – by USAID.
ii)      Under resolution No. 1458-A of the GOA dated 07.10.2004, the Armenian Water and
         Sewerage Company was reorganized into two companies: Armenian Water and
         Sanitation Company, and Water and Sanitation Company. The receivables (except for

                                               63
       834.9 million AMD) and the payables (except for 834.9 million AMD) and about 3.3
       billion AMD of assets of the Armenian Water and Sewerage Company were transferred
       to Water and Sanitation Company.
iii)   The financial accounting system of the Company was improved under the “Armenia
       Water Metering, Billing and Collection Assistance Program? financed by USAID:
iv)    The Accounting Unit is governed by and operates according to the new Accounting
       Policy and Accounting Guideline.
v)     Stuff Redundancy Program was implemented in the first two Project years. As a result,
       the Company’s stuff number was reduced by 610 employees and the salary of others was
       increased, which assisted in improving the living standard of employees and enhancing
       work efficiency.
e) Mid-term Review and Fiduciary Issues

1. The mid-term review of MWWP (3893AM) was conducted by the Bank Mission during its
visit to Yerevan in May 2-12, 2007. According to Aide Memoir issued based on the mission
results:

i)     The water quality has already improved in some parts of AWSC service area, and the
       availability of clean and safe water supply has increased in the overall service area.
       Despite initial delays, the investment program under components 2 (AWSC investments)
       and 3 (investment in branch systems) is now on track and is expected to be completed on
       time in February 2009. The investments carried out so far include a chlorination program,
       which has resulted in an increase in the percentage of water disinfected and the average
       bacteriological safety compliance, thus meeting the objective of improved water safety
       and quality. The rehabilitation activities include water treatment rehabilitation and
       systems repair.
ii)    Through organizational restructuring and efficiency improvements, including staff
       reduction, AWSC and its branches have been able to improve financial sustainability.
       Among other improvements, revenue collection increased significantly (from 47.9% to
       62.6% in the two years since the start of implementation) and the ratio of water volume
       billed on the basis of metering also increased from 25% to 47% during the same period.
       Despite these improvements in the revenue and collection performance, further
       significant improvement could have been achieved if the meter installation program had
       started early in the project. The meter installation program experienced delay.
iii)   In comparing the monitoring indicators for 2006 with the baseline data, significant
       progress has been made. This progress is mainly attributed to improvements in
       operational procedures, staff qualifications and in office facilities and equipment, and
       procurement of tools and equipment, water meters and laboratory and testing facilities. In
       addition, minor investments have been made, mainly through internal resources, in works
       rehabilitation, replacement of pumps and equipment, and improved/extended chlorination
       facilities.
iv)    In summary, the achievement of the project’s objectives is based on improvement of
       service and water quality, as well as satisfactory financial performance of AWSC and its

                                               64
       service branches. Because of this satisfactory performance in project implementation, the
       mission is satisfied that the project objectives are still valid and remain relevant.
       Therefore, the mission does not recommend any changes to project objectives or project
       activities.

2. The mid-term review of the AF MWWP (4514 AM) was conducted by the Bank Mission
during its visit to Yerevan in March 22-26, 2010. Aide Memoir was issued based on the Mission
results, and the Fiduciary Aspects section states the following:
      In spite of delays in preparation of biding documents for 20 tenders, the procurement
       performance was assessed satisfactory.
      The financial management arrangements at the CMU including accounting, financial
       reporting, budgeting and planning, funds flow, internal controls and external audit and
       staffing are satisfactory and continue to be acceptable to Bank.
      Based on the discussions with CMU as well as field trips to the implementation sites, no
       major environmental issues have been encountered during implementation of civil works.
The major performance indicators (intermediate results) as provided in the Quarter Report for
October-December 2009 evidence continued progress towards meeting project objectives. The
main indicators are as follows:

i)     Average duration of water supply has increased from 6 hr in baseline year to current 13
       hr.
ii)    The bacterial safety compliance has increased from 93% in baseline year to current 98%.
iii)   Percentage of individual subscribers billed on the basis of water meters has increased
       from 40% in baseline year to current 68%.
iv)    Company’s working ratio has decreased from 195% at the baseline year to current 104%.
v)     The percentage of cities with minimal daily hours of water supply services has increased
       from 68% in baseline year to current 85%.


f) Performance (Operation and Maintenance) of Structures Financed from the Projects

i)     Technical, financial, commercial and structural provisions.

       Technical: Armenia has sufficient water resources. About 96% potable water is obtained
       through tubewells, wells or springs. About 4% of potable water is produced from surface
       water after required treatment. The main indicators for service quality measurement are
       the water supply duration and the water quality. The water service target for AWSC for
       2011 was set at 16 hours (it made 14.94 hr in September 2011). The water quality target
       is achieved: it was 98.1% as of September 2011.

       The wastewater in almost all urban centers of Armenia is removed through wastewater
       disposal networks. However the existing treatment plants do not operate. They are
       deteriorated and cannot be rehabilitated anymore. The rural settlements usually do not

                                               65
       have wastewater collection system. It may be stated that actually nothing was proposed
       for rehabilitation, reconstruction or new construction of wastewater disposal systems
       under IDA credit projects.

       The losses within the system are very high. They made up 82.7% as of September, 2011.
       About 50% of that loss is estimated to be through the commercial losses and about 50% -
       through technical losses. It is assumed that 50-65% of losses occur due to the poor state
       of the internal distribution network of block apartment buildings and private houses
       which are beyond AWSC control boundaries.

       Water accounting has reached high levels. The number of subscribers billed on the basis
       of water meters made up 81.2% of total subscribers number. However there is a problem
       with the replacement of low quality water meters.

       Financial-commercial. According to Financial Statements and Independent Audit
       Opinion for the year ended 31.12.2010, the auditor has issued unmodified opinion for the
       financial statements of AWSC, which points out significant improvement in the quality
       of financial reports.

       Most of the audit recommendations of the previous years have been addressed or are in
       progress. In the meantime the auditor expressed a repetitive emphasis of matter on the
       entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, as the entity has incurred considerable
       financial losses in previous years, the aggregated amount of which makes up 17, 385, 512
       thousands AMD, and it is expected that the entity’s total liabilities will exceed its assets
       by the end of 2011.

       Revenue collection rate is high. It was 93.6% as of September 2011 (budget entities
       excluded). However as the fees are billed on the basis of volumes which currently cannot
       be measured accurately due to poor state water meters, it cannot be verified whether the
       subscribers pay for actually consumed quantities.

       Structural: It may be stated that the involvement of a private operator in water and
       wastewater system of Armenia was a success. The Management Contract of AWSC was
       signed in 2004. It has been successfully implementing for 7 years. Currently the contract
       is being amended according to 2+1 scheme (enhanced contract). It is envisaged to have a
       lease contract after completion of Management Contract. The asset ownership both in
       case of management contract and lease contract remains with the state.

ii)    Timely provision of investments and respective budget allocations.

The investments by the World Bank and GOA were provided in a timely manner and there were
no problems with late or delayed payment. The following table presents allocations from credit
proceeds and GOA co-financing by years.

g) Due Completion of Staff

According to Management Contract, the Management Contactor provides services (general
management, accounting, human resources, commercial, financial-economic, technical, etc.)
through his Management Staff and Operations staff.

The Management staff is the internationally experienced staff included in the Management
Contractor’s Bid. The number of Managerial Staff has been reduced.

The Operations Staff is the AWSC staff. Stuff Redundancy Program was implemented in the
first two Project years. As a result, the Company’s stuff number was reduced by 610 employees
and salary of others was increased, which assisted in improving the living standard of employees
and enhancing work efficiency

The following diagram shows average staff number of the Company by years.

Skilled employees-specialists have to be involved in order to improve Company management.
Currently they are not always available. Additional funds have to be allocated to settle this issue.
4. Assessment of Outcomes
Outcome of operations

The Management Contractor of AWSC has made considerable efforts resulting in improvement
of the system and higher performance indicators.

a)     The quality and the efficiency of water and wastewater disposal services provided by the
       Company have been improved. Special attention was paid to the improvement of daily
       hours of water supply, higher reliability and greater water safety.
b)     The consumers’ willingness to pay for water and wastewater services was promoted
       through higher quality and better arrangements of consumers service.
c)     The financial state of the Company was improved and its future sustainability was
       ensured.
d)     Staff training and re-qualification courses were organized to improve management,
       operation and maintenance and financial sectors thus ensuring stable operations of these
       sectors after contract completion.
e)     Equipment required for operation and maintenance of the system was procured. The
       technical assets and infrastructures operated by the company were rehabilitated, renewed
       or upgraded under Company’s MWWP fund.
f)     Investment programs were prepared and implemented within the contract period through
       the available funds and the long-term investment needs were assessed.

Implementation of the Additional Financing for MWWP (4514 AM) was reviewed by the Bank
Mission during its visit to Yerevan in September 11-12 and September 19-23, 2011. Aide

                                                68
Memoir was issued based on the Mission results, and the Fiduciary Aspects section states the
following:

Procurement: The mission reviewed the progress of procurement under the Project. Overall, the
procurement progress has been satisfactory.

Financial management: The auditor has issued unmodified opinion for the financial statements
of AWSC for the year ended 31.12.2010, which pointed out significant improvement in the
quality of financial reports. Most of the audit recommendations of the previous years have been
addressed or are in progress. In the meantime the auditor expressed a repetitive emphasis of
matter on the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, as the entity has incurred
considerable financial losses in previous years, the aggregated amount of which makes up
17, 385, 512 thousands AMD, and it is expected that the entity’s total liabilities will exceed its
assets by the end of 2011.

Environmental Safeguards. Environmental performance under MWWP continues to be
satisfactory. Ongoing works for the rehabilitation of water supply system of Hrazdan in general
comply with site-specific Environment Management Plan for this Category B operation.

The performance was also assessed by the Technical Auditor (Danish Rambol firm). According
to Year 2010 Audit Report of the Independent Technical Audit of Management Contract
(Rambol, Denmark). the Management Contractor in general has improved most performance
indicators in 2010 (the Auditor Report for year 2011 will be submitted in the beginning of 2012).
The Auditor has briefly presented Management Contractor’s achievements in 2010 for some
indicators.

Weighted average number of daily hours of drinking water service: The Management Contractor
has assessed this indicator slightly less than 14 hours by the end of 2010 which is about 1 hour
longer than in December 2009.

Weighted average water bacteriological safety compliance: This indicator was 98.2% in 2010.
The problem with this indicator is the low sample number – only 62% of the required samples
were taken and tested. It was agreed that in Project year 7 the incomplete samples will be
considered as non-complying samples.

Efficiency of water meters installation program: the percentage of domestic subscribers with
water meters points out the success of water meters installation program.

Financial operational stability of the Company: this indicator was quite below 1, therefore the
target is achieved.

No targets were specified for other performance indicators. However upon comparing the results
with 2009, the Auditor points out that most of indicators have been improved. However the
Auditor finds reasonable to provide some general comments for the improved indicators.




                                               69
             Percentage of cities with minimal daily hours of services: Good results were achieved for these
             indicators. However the Management Contractor has to direct his improvement efforts in such a
             manner to make the improvement beneficial to all the served subscribers. It is much important to
             increase water supply services by 2 hours to those subscribers who now get water for 3 hours or
             less per day than to extend water supply by the same 2 hours to those subscribers who get water
             for 17 hours per day.

             Collection ratio: collection rate has increased from 47.9% to 93.6%. However there are things
             that have to be done in this direction, in particular adjustment of customer’s data base and more
             accurate assessment of revenues.

             Electricity specific consumption: The average electricity consumption in 2010 made up 0.23
             KW*hours/cub.m. The baseline figure was assumed 0.43 KW*hours/cub.m. The overall
             electricity consumption was reduced from 60,048,000 KW*hours in base year to 34,511,000
             KW*hours in 2010 representing a 43% reduction.

             Percentage of water disinfected: About 78.8% of the total produced water was disinfected in
             2010. The corresponding baseline figure was 60.9%. According to standards, the required
             concentration of residual chlorine in the distribution network is 0.3-0.5 mg/l. Based on the
             hypochlorite quantity consumed in 2010, the Auditor calculated the average chlorine content and
             arrived at 0.59 mg/l, which is less than required by standards: 0.7-1.0 mg/l for groundwater and
             2.0-3.0 mg/l for surface water.

             The 21 PIs were mainly improved. The following table presents PI data by years and the target
             values for 31.12.2011, defined by the Aide Memoir of the World Bank’s mission in September-
             October 2010.

          2011. Three indicators did not reach target values.

          Risks to Development Outcome

          Under the Management Contract the operator takes the Management and Operations risk. He is
          paid a fee which is fixed against contractual requirements.

          Before an operator takes the risks associated with the lease contract, the AWSC has to be in a
          good and established situation including adequate information available on the utility.
          Additionally there has to be a clear indication of the potential for the planned system
          improvements and the application of the associated tariff, the resulting demand levels and
          potential revenue collections. The existence of an already successful Management Contract, that
          has generated the required information and experience, is an important basis for an operator to be
          prepared to take the additional risks involved under a lease contract.

          Through increasing the effective working life of pumps and pipes, the risks of major bursts and
          network failure will be significantly reduced.

                                                                 72
The non-revenue water is very high by any standard, resulting in increasing operating costs, lost
revenues, risks associated with water quality, water supply interruptions, and ultimately in the
risk of serious network failure. It is advised to carry out priority inventory of water assets to have
better understanding of sources of each component of non-revenue water.

Bank’s and Borrower’s Performance
In order to ensure the efficient commencement of the Project and the dedicated use of funds,
IDA allocated 1.195 million USD PPF at the preparation stage under which some preparative
activities were conducted. The Bank has been providing continuous support and assistance at the
project implementation stage (2004-2011). Each World Bank mission has assessed Project
progress achievements and drawbacks and provided recommendation for filling the gaps and
eliminating the delays.



5. Lessons Learned

The Management Contract for AWSC was signed in 2004 following the success of Yerevan
Management Contract and lessons learned from it. However, in order to make the performance
more efficient, the following measures are required.

   a) The performance indicators should include other criteria like water losses, establishment
      of a system for accounting water losses from the source to consumer.
   b) Targets were set only for 4 indicators out of 22 performance indicators specified by the
      Management Contract, and that was done merely for calculation of incentive
      compensation. In our opinion annual targets should be specified for other performance
      indicators as well.
   c) The base year and annual indicators should be calculated on the basis of maximal reliable
      data. For example, the accuracy of revenue and collection rate depends upon the accuracy
      of customers’ data base which has to be adjusted. Water losses should be calculated only
      after full water accounting, which currently is not in place.
   d) The activities on improving the AWSC system through sectorization and installation of
      water meters implemented under credit project have considerably improved operational
      and financial indicators. However, the lessons learned showed that the water meters data
      are incomplete. The studied meters have registered only 20% of produced water in
      average. The rest is documented as loss. In order to reduce essentially the losses and
      increase the volume of accounted water (and hence the generated revenue) it would be
      necessary to: (i) replace the broken water meters; (ii) remove the water meters of private
      houses outside private ownership areas and transfer their management to AWSC; (iii)
      install meters at apartment block buildings, etc.

   The table shows that AWSC has improved collection indicator, accrual and recording systems
   and has fully abandoned the practice of fee collection in cash by Company employees. The
   installation of water meters and increasing of water supply service hours in many places have
   increased consumers’ willingness to pay for services.

   Simultaneously, electricity was saved. The average staff number was reduced, meantime the
   labor costs have increased, so it may be concluded that the salary rates have increased.

   There were significant changes in the following items of administration costs:

The doubtful debt made up 4,131,432 thousands AMD in 2008, and the review of financial
statements of the previous years shows that no allowance was made for it in 2004-2008. It was
opened incrementally in 2008, therefore the losses also were increased.

However, if operational loss in 2008 made up 5,177,453 thousands AMD, out of which
4,131,432 thousands AMD (or 79.8%) was the doubtful loss, the operational loss of the company
in 2009 made up 4,349,088 thousands AMD, out of which only 666,109 thousands (or 15.3%)
was the doubtful debt. The lines of “Administrative costs? and “Other benefits/losses? have
increased in the share of accumulated loss in 2009 compared to 2008. The administrative costs
made up 1,832,988 thousands AMD in 2008 and 2,134,457 thousands AMD in 2009. “Other
benefits/losses? made up 20,369 thousands AMD in 2008 and 1,795,278 thousands AMD in
2009.

The Company loss was 525,170 thousand AMD in 2010, out of which 233,421 thousands AMD
or 44.5% was the doubtful debt.

As a result, the accumulated loss as of 31.12.2009 was 16,980,298 thousand AMD or a 31.5%
increase compared to 01.01.2009. The accumulated loss as of 31.12.2010 was 17,385,512
thousand AMD or a 2.4% increase compared to 01.01.2009

According to Financial Statements and Independent Audit Opinion for the year ended
31.12.2010, the auditor has issued unmodified opinion for the financial statements of AWSC,
which points out significant improvement in the quality of financial reports.

Most of the audit recommendations of the previous years have been addressed or are in progress.
In the meantime the auditor expressed a repetitive emphasis of matter on the entity’s ability to
continue as a going concern (for the first time it was expressed in the Financial Statements and
Independent Audit Opinion for the year ended 31.12.2009), as the entity has incurred
considerable financial losses in previous years, the aggregated amount of which makes up
17, 385, 512 thousands AMD, and it is expected that the entity’s total liabilities will exceed its
assets by the end of 2011.
