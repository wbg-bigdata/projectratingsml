MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THDE EXECUTVE DRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDI
TO THE FRDERAL REPUBLIC OF MGERI
FYOR THE SECOND NMLISTAI - ROADS PROJECT
1.    1 submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Federal Republic of Nigeria (FGN) for SDR 61.4 million, the
equivalent of US$85.0 million, to help finance the Second Multistate Roads Project (MSRP
I). The credit would be on standard IDA te,mns with a maturity of 35 years. The
Government would onlend: US$41.8 million equivalent to Oyo and US$40.9 million
equivalent to Osun at IBRD's standard variable interest, including five years of grace. The
states would bear the foreign exchange risk. In additioi, US$2.3 million equivalent would be
passed on to the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing (FMWH) to fnance technical
assistance, and traaing.
2.    Background: The lack of attention to state roads in Nigeria has left critical gaps in
the secondary road system, in institutional development and in the financial resources of state
roads' administration. A 1991 Bank Road Sector Strategy Paper concluded that creation of
appropriate institutional arrangements within the State Ministries of Works (SMOWs) for
planning, management, resource mobilization and maintenance is critical both to preserve
existing assets as well as to strike a balance between road expansion and maintenance. Past
and ongoing Bank assistance has supported improvements at the federal and local levels. The
proposed project, covering Oyo and Osun states, is a follow-on tD the First Multistate Roads
Project (MSRP-I) which covers Kano and Jigawa states and which was approved by the Board
on July 21, 1992. Selection of the states in MSRP-I and It was based on the capacity of these
states to meet the local costs of road programs where there is an economic reorientation of
expenditure from expansion to maintenance, upgrading, and strengthening. The Government
considers support for state roads programs a high priority on its development assistance
agenda, and the strategy for future state road development programs, as agreed between the
Government and the Bank includes, intralia, creation of appropriate organizational and
institutional arrangements within the SMOWs for planning and management of the state road
system; and development of a phased program of road improvements in order to strike a
proper balance between expansion of road infrastructure and preservation of existing assets.
3.    With premium gasoline priced at 70 Kobo (ess than 4 US cents) per liter, Nigeria's
petroleum product prices are amongst the lowest in the world and highly subsidized in terms
of covering the crude production and refining costs and revenue foregone from not charging
the export parity prices. Reduction of the subsidy on petroleum products has been a critical
issue in the dialogues between the Government of Nigeria and the Bank and the IMF since the
emergence of major fiscal and external imbalances early in the 1980.. In 1991, the
Government reached an understanding with the IMP to move towards export parity priing
over a four-year period. This understanding was reached in the contet of a stand-by
arrangement wbich expired in April 1992. Since the expiry of the arrangement, the Bank and
the IMF have been engaged in discussions with the Government on a strategy to stabilize the
economy and lay the basis for growth in the medium term. Increasing petroleum product
prices to help reduce fiscal imbalance is being promoted as a critical ingredient of the strategy
which would, if endorsed by the new civilian administration, form the basis of a medim-term
Enhanced Structr Adjustment Facility (ESAF) program with the IMP.



4.    Prject Objecv: The main objectives of the proposed project are: (a) to improve
iater-city transport within the two states and reduce transport costs through improving the
condition of state road networks; (b) to improve organizational arrangements for better
planning and management of the state road system, including strengthening of the institutional
capacity of SMOWs; (c) to use contractors for road improvement and for a major portion of
road maintenance works; (d) to enhance resource mobilization and budgetary allocation at the
state level to ensure sustained maintenance of the road networks; and (e) to build technical
capacity at the state level to assess environmental impacts of road projects. The Projert
would also contribute to development of the private sector through training and participation
of small and medium scale local contractors in carrying out an increased share of road
maintenance and rehabilitation using labor and light equipment based technologies.
5.    Project Description: The proposed project would support the following main
components in the states of Oyo and Osun: (a) Road ..rlk: implementation of selected high
priority road works in the States' five-year economically justified road investment program
including rehabilitation and upgrading (436 kIm), construction (58 km), rehabilitation of gravel
roads (300 km) and spot improvement of gravel roads (200 km); (b) Maintenance by contract:
initiation of a program of routine and periodic maintenance of roads by private contractors,
including the development and training of small scale domestic contractors in using labor
based and light equipment assisted construction methods; (c) Vehicles and eaui=ient:
purchase of vehicles and equipment to strengthen institutional capacity to design and supervise
the project work and enhance road safety; and (d) Institutional development: establishment of
appropriate institutional arrangements within the SMOWs and 'support for planning, design,
maintenance and supervision of roads, contract management and manpower development and
taining. In addition, technical assistance would be ptr 4ided to FMWH for coordinating the
project in all the states and conducting environmental and other relevant transport sector
studies, including preparation of the next phase of the state roads program.
6.    Proect Financing: The cost of the project is estimated to be US$118.2 million, of
which IDA financing would be US$85.0 million (74% of the total costs excluding taxes and
duties) covering fully the foreign exchange component of the project (US$80.9 million), and
part of the local costs (US$4.1 million equivalent). The Federal Government would finance
$0.2 million and the state governments would finance the balance of about US$33.0 million
equivalent. A summary is given in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Nigeria are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is included at the end of this memorandum. The Staff Appraisal Report
No. 11327-UNI dated February 5, 1993 is being distributed separately.
7.    Proiect Imofementation: The project would be implemented and managed at the state
level by the SMOWs through the civil engineering divisions, with technical assistance
provided initially to build up the institutional capacity for planning and contracts management
At the federal level, the project would be coordinated by FMWH through the Federal
Highways Department by a management team being set up under MSRP-I. A mid-term
review would be carried out to assess overall progress in implementation of the project and
achievement of its objectives, with a view to redesigning or re-structuring project components
and organizational structures as needed. Project preparation is already in an advanced. .ge.
Local consultants have been appointed and are currently in the field preparing design detais
and tender documents for two road projects in each state. Model ICB documents already in
use by FMWH and approved by the Bank will be adapted for use by SMOWs.



8.    Proiect Sustainability: The project would enhance the capacity of state authorities to
plan and implement routine and periodic maintenance of state roads and ensure sustainability
by: (a) using maintenance contracts with domestic small to medium-sized contractors; and
(b) improving the availability of funds through policy reforms affecting resource mobilization,
cost recovery and budgetary allocation through which recurrent expenditures will be covered.
9.    Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement: The World Bank Group involvement
in the roads sector in Nigeria has largely been on federal and rural roads. The MSRP-I
(Credit 2415-UNI) is expected to be implemented in the period 1993-97. Experience with
state road agencies is therefore limited. However, the Bank has prepared several project
completion and sector reports addressing the development of federal and rural roads in
Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa. While most projects have either fulfilled or exceeded the
physical targets of road lengths to be improved, the maintenance achievements have fallen
short of target in many cases.
10.   Two types of problems predominated in past lending operations in the transport
sector, and measures have been taken in the design of the proposed project to avoid their
recurrence. The first problem was the lack of success of institutional development
components compared to the relative success of physical investment. The project would build
up the SMOWs by first of all, reducing the amount of force account operations and
strengthening management's capacity to plan, design and supervise the works to be carried out
by contract. Most road maintenance works would be transferred to private contractors
thereby reducing bureaucratic constraints and increasing efficiency. The project would also
establish at the state level a network of technology transfer centers to meet the technological
needs of the SMOWs and the construction industry. Second, past road projects suffered
substantial delays in reaching agreement on bidding documents and other procurement related
matters due pardy to a lack of familiarity with Bank requirements stemming from the lack of
staff continuity, poor training and communication. During preparation of the proposed
project, special effort has been made to familiarize staff at the FMWH and the SMOWs with
Bank requirements for standard bidding docuients, which the FMWH has now adapted for its
own use. The advanced preparation of the designs and adoption of standard bidding
documents already in use under the Highway Sector Project, coupled with at source deduction
of counterpart funds will ensure speedier implementation of the project by SMOWs (para 7).
11.   Rationale for Bank/IDA Involvement: The project would be part of the ongoing effort
to upgrade Nigeria's state highway system, to make more effective use of existing
infrastructure, and to identify cost recovery mechanisms for roads. As works and
transportation normally account for a significant percentage of public expenditure at the state
and local levels, an IDA-financed state roads project could be an effective vehicle for
institutional and fiscal reform. The Bank/IDA has been a catalyst in Nigeria at the federal
level in implementing more economic road investment programs, stressing rehabilitation and
maintenance over new investment, and emphasizing institutional development and cost
recovery. IDA Is now in a strong position to extend these benefits to the state level. IDA
has also intensified its dialogue with Government on the need to shift road maintenance
activities from force account operations to greater use of contractors and to make progress
towards cost recovary from road users. The project provides a good opportunitY to
strengthen the SMOWs in contract supervision while encouraging greater involvement of the
private road contracting industry. Hence, the project fits well into the overaU Country
Assistance Strategy, which is expected to be discussed at the Board meeting on March 4,
1993. The project also fits well into the country strategy for environmental instiution building.



12.   Ageed Actions: To prevent delays in release of counterpart funds, State
Governments have already agreed to authorize at-source deduction of their local counterpart
funds from the Federation Account to be deposited directly into the Project Accounts. During
negoations, further agreements were obtained from Government including the following key
items: (a) a specific amnount of funds, currently estimated at US$750,000 equivalent, and to be
agreed by October 31 each year with IDA, will be allocated annually in the budget of each
state for recurrent maintenance of state roads and that these funds will be released in a timely
manner; (b) the states will adjust transport related charges to recover at least recurrent road
maintenance costs each year; (c) road maintenance works to be performed under the Project
(ensuring up to 70% of all maintenance works to be carr;ed out by the fifth year of Project
execution) will be done by the private contractors; (d) no expenditure on individual road
projects outside the project will be undertaken by the states in excess of US$4.0 million
without prior consultation and agreement with IDA; (e) key indicators will be used to monitor
project performance and achievement of development objectives; (t) arrangements to conduct
Environmenal Impact Assessment and steps to be taken to mitigate any adverse environmental
impacts of the proposed project; (g) annual reviews will be held no later than October 31 of
each year to assess progress, and review and agree on the work program and budget
allocations for the following year with particular attention to the manpower development and
training; (h) the minimum acceptable Economic Rate of Return on any road project included
in th.- project will be 12%; (i) by June 30, 1995, axle load surveys will be undertaken to
develop and implement load control measures, if required; and 0) a mid-term project review
will be carried out involving IMA and Federal and State Government agencies not later than
June 1996 to assess (i) progress made in project implementation, including the status of road
user charges and cost recovery, the use of private contractors, and training; (ii) performance
of FMWH in its coordinating capacity; (iii) performance of SMOWs as executing agencies;
(iv) evaluation of key monitoring indicators; (v) assessment of environmental impacts;
(vi) axle loads on state roads and stipulation of an action plan to deal with over-loading, if
needed; and (vii) need for redesign and/or restructring nf project components.
13.   Conditions of credit effectiveness are: (a) the fulfillment by either Oyo State or Osun
State of (i) signing of a subsidiary loan agreement between the FGN and at least one of the
participating states; (ii) implementation, in at least one state, of appropriate measures
satisfactory to IDA to increase the level of road user charges collected at the state level to
recover at least the costs of recurrent maintenance through road user charges; (iii) appoint-
ment of management consultants by at least one participating state, on terms and conditions
agreeable to the Bank; and (b) opening by each participating state of a Project Account (in
Naira) with an initial deposit of at least US$280,000 equivalent in Naira in a commercial
bank. For the state which had not implemented them, items (i), (ii) and (iii) under (a) would
be conditions of disbursement.
14.   Environmental Aspects: Since the project consists mainly of rehabilitating roads,
there are no major concerns for environmental impacts. Minor concerns involve mainly
temporary disruptions during construction, improper re-vegetation of embankments and
borrow pits, and soil erosion and gully formation resulting from poor drainage. These aspects
were studied extensively under MSRP-I and this project will replicate the procedures agreed
under that project and provide support for the proposed Environmental Assessment and
Monitoring Unit in FMWH and its extensions at the state level. The project is assigned to
Category B for environmental impact assessment. There are two new roads to be constructed
under the project (8 km and 50 km). Although no major issues are likely to arise,



-  -
construction of the roads would be conditional on satisfactory resolution of any Issues and on
incorporation of steps needed to mitigate adverse impacts.
15.   Program Objective Categories: The main thrust of the project is in removing critical
bottlenecks in the basic state roads infrastructure, thereby reducing transport costs and
improving the links between federal and rural roads networks. The relationship with the
country's anti-poverty strategy is indirect, in that the savings in transport costs will eventually
be passed on to the rural farmers in the form of higher prices for agricultural produce. In
addition, the project would contribute to the development of the private sector in road
construction and maintenance through training of domestic contractors and through increasing
the share of road works undertaken by contract.
16.   Project Benefit: The main benefit from the project would be a more efficient state
roads network that permits a higher level of economic activity. Project justification is based
on savings in vehicle operating costs and reductions in future maintenance costs. Other
benefits include improved road safety, time savings and improved links between federal and
rural road systems. Benefits of the institutional development and capacity building
components are potentially high though unquantifiable. The overall economic rate of return
(ERR) for the project is estimated as 35%.
17.  RBjsl: There are three major risks associated with the project. The first concerns the
ability of new and untried state executing agencies to effectively manage a large increase in
maintenance operations and the switch to contract works. The second risk concerns state
capacity to maintain an acceptable contracting process. Given the many problems encountered
in implementing contracts in Nigeria over the past decades, extra caution will be required to
ensure that the proper supervision and completion of contracts is maintained. The third risk
involves the provision of counterpart funds which have historically been a major problem in
project implementation in all sectors. The first two risks will be addressed through close and
continual interactions of the state agencies, consultants, FMWH, and IDA. The third risk will
be addressed by having counterpart funds deducted at the source from the Federation
Account.
18.   Recommendation: I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

The Department has taken several actions to deal with generic implementation Issues such as weak
institutions and project management, slow procurement, and inadequate counterpart fimding. These actions
include: (a) appointment of a procurement specialist and a local accountant in the Resident Mission; (b)
appointment of Portfolio Managers in all sector divisions; (c) establishment of an implementation task force
to formulate actions to deal with cross-sectoral problems and to coordinate actions to clean-up the portfolio
through the redesign of projects, reallocation of funds to viable components and cancellation of loan
components which cannot be turned around; (d) a more pro-active role for the Resident Mission in
implementation by working even more closely with state-level officials; (e) increased emphasis on Sector
Implementation Reviews (SIRs) to be followed by a redesigned Country Implementation Review (CIR). The
Resident Mission is also continuing efforts to meet with the new State Governors. In addition, a number of
new initiatives have been put in place to strengthen the implementWon process. For example, a new
supt.vision strategy has been adopted for the agriculture sector; in order to engage state governments on
generic and sector issues in a more effective manner, task management for supervision is being allocated by
state rather than by project, as there are agricultural projects in all 30 states. Total disbursemens in FY92
amounted to US$344.7 million compared with US$208.4 million in FY91.
A number of portfolio reviews have taken place since early 1992 to identify specific actions for slow
disbursing projects, including possible cancellation of funds unlikely to be used in the next three years, the
use of upcoming loan closing dates to agree on timebound specific project actions, as well as areas for project
restructring in accordance with Bank guidelines. Total cancellations agreed with the Government now total
$250 million, of which $208 million have so far been processed for cancellation.
In addition, new initiatives are being launched by the Department. The Region has made additional
resources available to help accelerate implementation of Nigeria's portfolio. These resources wil frter
strengthen the staff and operations of the Resident Mission which is playing an increasing role in project
supervision. Furthermore, eight projects have been identified for special emphasis based on implementation
lags. Half of these projects support the social sectors, and the average level of commitment is over $100
million. Special action plans have been developed for all eight projects to reflect the primary sources of delay:
decision-making, procurement and counterpart funding.
To address the wider concerns of adequate budgetary allocation for timely counterpart funding, the
task force on implementation has developed a comprehensive table of counterpart funding requrements for
each ongoing project over the next two years broken down by federal and state level contribution. Ihis has
been shared with the government for their use in financial planning. It is also intended to serve as a useful
budgetary guideline for the Transition Council and new civilian government.
