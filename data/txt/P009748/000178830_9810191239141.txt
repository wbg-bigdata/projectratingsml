I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of India (the Government) has requested Bank finan-
cing for the Thal Fertilizer Plant (the Project) to be located at Thal, about
25 km south of Bombay (Map IBRD 14286). The Project will be owned and oper-
ated by the Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd. (RCF, the Company), a
wholly government owned company. The proposed Bank loan of US$250.0 million
would cover approximately 31% of the estimated total financing requirements of
US$812.3 million and about 73% of the total foreign exchange needs of US$343.1
million. The remaining foreign exchange and the entire local cost financing
would be provided from RCF's internal resources and by the Government, either
from its own resources or with other external credits.
1.02      The Project will be based on associated gas from the Bombay High
offshore oil fields supplemented with non-associated gas from the South
Bassein offshore fields, and will produce approximately 1.34 million tons per
year (tpy) of urea for sale to farmers and 27,000 tpy of ammonia for sale to
other fertilizer plants and industrial consumers in India. The development of
these offshore oil fields, production platforms, the oil and gas pipeline
transport and shore facilities was partly financed by a Bank loan of US$150
million (Loan 1473-IN). The Project will include two single-train ammonia
units - each of 1,350 tons per day (tpd) capacity - along with three urea
units - each of 1,500 tpd capacity, as well as utilities and a large portion
of the infrastructure requirements of the relatively undeveloped location. By
1985, about 35% of project output is expected to be absorbed by farmers in
Maharashtra, where the plant is to be situated, and the rest will be marketed
in Uttar Pradesh. The Project will create directly some 1,600 jobs and in-
directly support up to 5,000 jobs in transportation, marketing and communica-
tions. In addition, during construction up to 5,000 workers would be employed.
1.03      The Bank Group has been actively involved over the past twelve
years in assisting India's fertilizer sector; this loan would be the tenth
operation in fertilizer production facilities, including two by IFC, and eight
by Bank/IDA. At present, there are 20 major operating fertilizer companies
in India, with 26 plants having a total annual capacity of about 3.3 million
tons of nitrogen (N) and 1.2 million tons of phosphate (P 0 ). Although the
Project will substantially contribute to the country's domestic production of
nitrogenous fertilizer accounting for 12% of the 1985 production, imports
are still expected to account for 12% of total consumption in that year.
1.04      The Project was identified in October 1977 by a mission consisting
of Messrs. H. S. Kohli, D. Caplin and Y. T. Shetty, and appraised in January
1978 by Messrs. Eus Tortorelli and Ramon Beteta, all of the Industrial
Projects Department. With the change in project location announced in August
1978, the Project was reappraised in February 1979 by Messrs. Rakesh Bhan and
S. Venkataraman of the Industrial Projects Department, Mr. J.M.H. Tixhon of
the Office of the Environmental and Health Affairs and Mr. N.E. Krogh-Poulsen
of the Transportation Division of the South Asia Projects Department.

II. THE FERTILIZER INDUSTRY
A.   The Fertilizer Industry
2.01      The Indian `ertilizer industry, which provides a major input to
the agricultural sector, is a key industry in the country. The Government
has, therefore, close:Ly guided its development and formulated policies con-
cerning investments, product pricing, choice of feedstock, etc. necessary for
supporting its growth. The industry has also received high priority in the
Government's investment plans.  The general approach of the Government has
been to aim at efficient self-sufficiency in fertilizer production, adopting
technologies appropriate to Indian raw material resources and following
closely the international technological improvements and innovations. The
Government has continued to regulate fertilizer distribution and pricing to
ensure that fertilizer is delivered to the farmer at the lowest possible cost.
A detailed review of the Indian fertilizer industry is available in Report
No. 928-IN, dated November, 1975 "Appraisal of a Project to Improve Fertilizer
Production - Fertilizer Industry Credit: India." The following paragraphs
review the highlights of the developments within the Indian fertilizer in-
dustry and in the Government's approach to it during the last twelve years.
1.   Past and Future Capacity Growth
2.02      Since 1949/50 there has been rapid growth in both nitrogenous and
phosphatic fertilizer capacity in India, as shown in the following table:
India - Installed Fertilizer Capacity a!
('000 tpy of nutrient)

1971/72                         1,520                             500
1976/77                         2,988                             801
1977/78                         3,028                             915
1978/79 (actual)                3,259                           1,236
1982/83 (projected)             5,349                           1,354
1984/85 (projected)             6,825                           1,354
a/   All potash (K20) is imported.
A large expansion program now underway is expected to raise the installed
nitrogen capacity to 6.8 million tpy of nutrient by fiscal year 1984/85 -
more than twice the 1978/79 capacity - and phosphate capacity to 1.4 million
tpy of P 205 - about 50% above the 1977/78 capacity (Annex 2-1). The locations



- 3 -
of the fertilizer plants and projects are shown in Map IBRD 13342R. There is
no domestic production of potash; about 600,000 tons of K2 0 were imported in
1977/78 for direct application and for domestic production of multinutrient
complex fertilizers. By 1966/67, urea and calcium ammonium nitrate formed 32%
and 15% of the total nitrogen capacity, respectively. The share of urea
increased to 72% by 1978/79 and is expected to further increase to 78% by
1982/83.   Complex fertilizers formed 75% of the phosphate capacity in 1977/78
and their share is expected to be maintained during the 1980s.
2.   Feedstock
2.03      About 22% of India's 1966/67 nitrogen capacity was based on naphtha
as feedstock, using the partial oxidation technology, with the rest based on
other feedstocks - coke oven gas, coke, electricity and lignite. With avail-
ability of a commercially well-proven naphtha reformation catalyst and attrac-
tive pricing of naphtha in international trade, a large part of the nitrogen
capacity in the late 1960s was built on the use of naphtha, so that by 1977/78,
naphtha was used for about 71% of the country's nitrogen capacity. Past and
projected feedstock usage is shown in the following table.

During the early 1970s, about 2 million tpy of new nitrogen capacity was
planned based on fuel oil and coal, to reduce the naphtha import bill. By
1984/85, about 1.6 million tpy of fuel oil-based capacity will be in oper-
ation, resulting in an annual net foreign exchange saving of about US$90
million (in 1978 prices) due to the lower cost of importing fuel oil. The
first fuel oil-based plant at Nangal, commissioned in January 1978, is now
operating satisfactorily after overcoming some initial commissioning problems.
The second fuel oil-based plant at Sindri, also financed by the Bank (para
2.08) is currently under commissioning. The coal-based plants at Talcher and
Ramagundam, also now being commissioned, will contribute to an annual net



- 4 -
foreign exchange saving (in 1978 dollars) of about US$55 million. The Gov-
ernment intends to plan further capacity based on coal only when adequate
experience is available from these plants. Finally, natural gas from the
large offshore oil and gas reserves being developed near Bombay and onshore
Assam reserves will provide feedstock for about 2.1 million tpy of nitrogen
capacity including the Project, a similar plant being planned in Gujarat and
a smaller expansion project at Namrup. This will represent about 31% of the
nitrogen capacity by L984185, when the share of naphtha will drop to about 36%
of the nitrogen capacity.
3.   Plant Capacities and Technologies
2.04      The small plants operating in 1966/67 used a range of technologies
including partial oxidation of naphtha, coke and lignite gasification, frac-
tionation and cracking of coke oven gas and electrolysis of water.  Adoption
of the naphtha reformation technology, with experience already available
outside India, enabled larger ammonia plants of 300 to 500 tpd capacity to be
constructed in the late 1960s at Visakhapatnam, Kota and Kanpur. The first
large capacity naphtha-based ammonia plant (750 tpd capacity) with all centri-
fugal compressor drives was commissioned in Madras in 1971/72. All subsequent
natural gas and naphtha based plants, other than expansions, have capacities
ranging from 600 to 1,100 tpd; in 1978/79 nine such plants were in operation
and two under construction. India's fertilizer capacity expansion in the
early 1970s included six large fuel oil based plants at Haldia (600 tpd),
Nangal, Sindri, Bhatinda, Panipat (900 tpd each) and Broach (1,350 tpd).
Together with the two 900 tpd coal gasification-based ammonia plants now
nearing completion al Talcher and Ramagundam, the Indian fertilizer industry
has during the past decade gained substantial experience in building and
operating ammonia plants over a range of capacities and with different feed-
stocks, as well as p:Lants for the production of fin:ished fertilizers such
as urea, calcium ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate, superphosphates,
nitrophosphates and complex fertilizers.
4.   Capacity Utilization
2.05      An important factor affecting domestic availability of nitrogenous
fertilizers has been the relatively low average capacity utilization of the
Indian plants, especially in the public sector. Overall capacity utiliza-
tion reached a peak of 74% in 1972/73, but declined sharply to 58% in 1973/74
as new units at Goa, Durgapur and Cochin initiated production. The capacity
utilization improved steadily during the next four years and in 1977/78 the
industry matched the earlier peak capacity utilization rate of 74%.  However,
in 1978/79 the average capacity utilization of the industry dropped back to
72%.  A detailed analysis of the capacity utilization for the period 1971-79
is given in Annex 2-2 and summarized below:

2.06      The low capacity utilization cannot, however, be explained entirely
in a public versus private sector ownership framework.  In addition to man-
agement, other key factors which have affected capacity utilization of both
public and private sector plants are plant design and age, size of plant,
power availability, transport bottlenecks and feedstock.
2.07      The private sector plants are generally of smaller capacity (300-
500 tpd), based on older proven design and engineering supplied by foreign
engineering firms. As a group they have been in operation longer and have
solved initial teething problems. While their overall capacity utilization
has consistently been better than public sector plants as a group, they have
also suffered temporary drops in capacity utilization due to interruptions in
power supply or non-availability of adequate railway transport for feedstock
and product movement.
2.08      The public sector plants are generally of more recent origins, are
generally significantly larger, use a more varied range of feedstocks and
were built with a much greater-inv-olvement of local engineering and equipment
supplies. Four of the eleven public sector plants (Nangal, Trombay, Gorakhpur,
and Namrup) have generally shown satisfactory capacity utilization rates equal
to or better than plants in the private sector, though production at even
these plants has at times suffered due to periodic power supply and transport
problems. The original plant at Sindri also showed satisfactory performance
until the mid-1970s when the age of the facilities and difficulties in obtain-
ing continued supplies of quality raw materials combined to limit production
(the plant is now temporarily shut down awaiting commissioning of the IDA-
financed modernization project). The overall unsatisfactory capacity utiliza-
tion of the public sector plants, occurring during a period of substantial ex-
pansion, can in part be attributed to the managerial limitations of the Fertil-
izer Corporation of India (FCI), which has led to its restructuring (paras 2.17
and 2.18). Perhaps more importantly, however, have been severe technical prob-
lems which have resulted in difficult commissioning at the new plants (e.g.,
Nangal, Sindri, etc.) and continuing operating problems at the five older plants
(Cochin, Durgapur, Udyogmandal, Rourkela, and Neyveli). Design defects have
plagued certain of these plants and the foreign firms, where involved, have
moved to rectify these deficiencies. Other problems, however, have resulted
from a specific policy of using indigenous resources leading to maximum employ-
ment of local engineering and locally supplied equipment in a technologically



- 6 -
difficult industry. Experience has modified this policy but resolving the
resulting technical problems through redesign, replacement and "debottle-
necking" programs, has taken time, while problems related to raw materials
supply, power, etc. have, as previously mentioned, in some cases also con-
strained operations. A more detailed description of the problems faced at
these plants is given in Annex 2-2.
2.09      Of the unscheduled production losses of about 350,000 tpy of nitro-
gen in the last three years, equipment failures in aged plants and in recently
commissioned new plants accounted for about 70% and power problems for another
20%. Problems affecting the performance of the public sector fertilizer
plants were studied by a Government committee in 1978 and several remedial
measures recommended. Its recommendations, including those for plant modifi-
cations and better planning of preventive maintenance to minimize such unsched-
uled losses, have been adopted. The full impact of these efforts should be
reflected in higher capacity utilization gradually during the next few years.
2.10      The Bank has also assisted the Government efforts to improve fer-
tilizer production. As part of the Trombay IV Project (Credit 481-IN) a
credit of US$17 million was made available to revamp the Durgapur and Cochin
plants.  In addition, two credits were designed to increase production at
Nangal (Credit 357-IN) and Sindri (Credit 520-IN), Finally, the Fertilizer
Industry Credit of US$105 million, approved in 1975, was specifically designed
to improve capacity utilization of the Indian fertilizer industry. The
Credit covered a large number of projects involving eleven plants including
(a) changeover to fuel oil feedstock at Neyveli (b) a naphtha reformer at
Rourekela, (c) captive power plants at Durgapur, Goirakhpur, Trombay and
Visakhapatnam to meet the critical plant loads and reduce production losses
due to power fluctuations, (d) purge gas recovery un1its planned at Baroda,
Goa, Kalol and Vizag to increase ammonia production, and (e) debottlenecking
of the phosphoric acid plant at Baroda. Since none of these IDA financed
facilities were operational before 1977/78, their beneficial effect orn
capacity utilization has not yet been fully felt.
2.11      To take full advantage of existing investments, the Government has
established a control and monitoring system to review performance against
unit-wise monthly production targets developed after detailed discussions
with plant managements. Weekly production statistics are now being received
and reviewed by the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers to monitor pro-
gress and identify constraints to better production. and to evolve solutions.
Foreign exchange for import of normal maintenance and emergency spares is
now more readily available. These efforts have been reflected in recent
production improvements and overall capacity utilization is targeted to
increase from 72% in 1978/79 to a satisfactory average level of about 84%
by 1984/85, after providing for possible unforeseen losses, as shown in the
following table for different plant categories. Since both public and private
sector plants without technical problems have, as explained above. shown
satisfactory capacity utilization and considering that the proposed Project
is based on gas as feedstock, the 90% average capacity utilization rate
assumed for the Project (para 8.01) is considered reasonable.

5.   Local Plant Building Capabilities
2.12      Faced with a large fertilizer expansion plan, government policies
from the mid-1960s have promoted domestic engineering and construction capa-
bilities and facilities for the local fabrication of plant and machinery.
The earlier public sector projects implemented in this manner suffered con-
siderable completion delays, cost overruns and commissioning difficulties
due to lack of local experience with large projects, inadequate coordination
with site management, excessive premature reliance on local supplies and
use of tied financing from various sources. The Bank's discussions with the
Government and FCI have resulted in improvements in project implementation
by strengthening the capabilities of the public sector engineering companies
and improving project coordination procedures. As a result, the more recent
Bank-financed projects are being physically completed with minimum delays and
cost overruns. The development and use of local capabilities to carry out
detailed engineering and project management has reduced the foreign cost of
engineering consultants in recent projects by about 40%.



- 8 -
2.13      India's large fertilizer program has promoted domestic capabilities
in several allied fields. India now manufactures a large range of equipment
and supplies for fertilizer and chemical plants, often in collaboration with
experienced foreign manufacturers. These include offsite and process boilers
with Combustion Engineering (US), centrifugal and reciprocating compressors
with Pignone (Italy), process pumps with Pignone (Italy) and Klein, Schanzlin
and Becker (Germany), cooling towers with Morley (US), instruments with Taylor
(US), etc. The local manufacturers initially had problems in making timely
deliveries due to poor materials planning, inadequate work scheduling and
difficulties in working with special alloys. Deliveries have since improved,
though there is room for further improvement. Workmanship has been good and
prices are competitive. Indian suppliers are now providing about half of the
total supplies required for a fertilizer project. India has also developed a
competent construction industry to carry out plant civil works and erection at
substantially below international costs. The share of civil works and erection
costs tends to be low in Indian projects, only about 6% and 4%, respectively,
of total project cosl:s, compared to about 10% and 15% in most developed coun-
tries. As a result, costs of Bank-financed projects in India compare fav-
orably with projects of similar capacities elsewhere.
2.14      The Indian fertilizer industry employed in 1978 over 60,000 people,
about 15% of them in the managerial and supervisory categories. Several
of the major plants 'have facilities to recruit and train managers, supervisors
and technicians. As a result, recruitment of reasonably qualified and experi-
enced staff for operating new projects has not been difficult.
6.   Product Pricing Policies
2.15      Farm gate urea prices, controlled by the Government, determine
the ex-factory prices allowed to fertilizer producers. Up to mid-1973, the
international urea prices were lower than the ex-factory prices allowed to
the Indian plants, mrainly due to the large world surpluses that were available
for international trade. Between mid-1973 and early 1976, when international
urea prices were much higher than domestic ex-factory prices, the Govern-
ment introduced a system of "pooled" pricing to bring the fertilizer to the
farmer at the lowest: possible price. Urea was made available to the farmer
at Rs 1,820 (US$212,l per ton, 1/ even when the landed cost of imported urea
was around Rs 2,680 (US$312) per ton. At that time, sale of locally produced
urea, which had an ex-factory price of Rs 1,095/toll, provided Rs 610/ton to
the pool to subsidize imports. As the imported urea price dropped, the
cross subsidy has been reduced, and urea is now available to the farmer at
Rs 1,297/ton. 1/ With the sharp increases in inpul prices following the
1973 oil price increases, the ex-factory realization per ton of urea only
increased from Rs 808/ton in 1972/73 to Rs 1,158/ton in 1978/79; even this
substantial increase was not adequate to cover the cost increases.
1/   Excluding dealer's margin and freight which total an additional
Rs 153/ton.



- 9 -
2.16      In November 1977, the Government announced a new fertilizer pricing
policy, covering straight nitrogenous fertilizers, which ensures a predeter-
mined return to the manufacturer without increasing the farm gate prices. The
policy has been extended to phosphatic fertilizers in early 1979. The revised
pricing policy provides a 12% after tax return on net fixed assets plus
working capital less long-term borrowings when the plant is operated at 80%
capacity. Although the pricing formula provides only a modest financial rate
of return (in constant terms) for a new project, it provides adequate cash
flow in the initial operating years and due to the high pretax returns of
28.4% encourages reinvestment. In addition, it provides a strong incentive
to the producers to improve capacity utilization. The fertilizer pricing
policy is further discussed in para 4.23.
7.   Restructuring of Public Sector Companies
2.17      In 1978/79, about 49% of the total installed nitrogen capacity of
3.3 million tpy, was in the public sector and about 0.2 million tpy in the
cooperative sector (Annex 2-3). Including the cooperative and joint sector
capacity of 1.03 million tpy, the public sector directly or indirectly
accounted for about 81% of the domestic nitrogen capacity and the share is
expected to increase further to about 90% by 1984/85. The large public sector
expansion program had mainly been implemented through the Fertilizer Corpora-
tion of India (FCI). In 1977/78, the FCI had an installed capacity of 0.92
million tpy of nitrogen (30% of the total) and another 1.25 million tpy of
capacity was under construction. As a result of the rapid expansion during
the 1970s, management capabilities within FCI had been overstretched.
2.18      During the past few years, the Government and the Bank have been
discussing the need for decentralized decision-making in FCI. As a first
step, to improve the organization of the public sector industry and thereby
its performance, in 1975 the Government formed a new public sector company -
National Fertilizers Ltd. (NFL), to implement the Bhatinda and Panipat Proj-
ects. This approach was successful and a scheme for further restructuring
the public sector fertilizer units was evolved during 1976-77 and formally
announced in January 1978. This scheme regroups the units earlier managed by
FCI and NFL into four separate geographically oriented companies. The exist-
ing Trombay plant along with the proposed Thal Project forms a West Coast
company, called the Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd. (RCF). The
remaining plants and related marketing activities have been assigned to the
other three regional companies - National Fertilizer Ltd. (North), Hindustan
Fertilizer (East), and Fertilizer Corporation of India (Central). The erst-
while Planning and Development Division of FCI has become an independent
company - Fertilizer (Planning and Development) India Ltd. (FPDIL). The new
companies were legally formed in April 1978. The above scheme is expected to
improve delegation of responsibility and authority to the unit/project level
and thus ensure better performance.

B.   Bank Group Role
2.19      The Bank Group has so far participated in the financing of nine
fertilizer projects in India with a total contribution of US84734 miLill1on.
The financing has been through IDA for six public sector projects, IFC for
two private sector projects and IBRD for a cooperative sector project, as
shown in the table on the following page.
2.20      In the case of the first three IDA financed projects at Goralkhpur,
Cochin and Nangal, there have been completion delays of between 16 to 31
months and cost overruns of 35%-45%. While delays in finalizing engineering
arrangements delayed the Gorakhpur Project, the Coc'hin II Project suffered
from poor project management and the company's financial problems. The
Nangal Project was affected by delayed delivery of equipment and cost
increases following the 1973 oil crisis. However, performance has substan-
tially improved in t'he more recently financed projezts. The Sindri and
Trombay Projects have been physically completed with only 3 and 6 months
delay, respectively and at or close to appraisal cost estimates. After an
initial delay of 12 months when the feedstock was changed from fuel oil to
naphtha, the Phulpur Project is now expected to be completed within original
cost estimates and on the revised completion schedule. Project completion
and the OED report finalized for the Gorakhpur Project have not brought out
any major issues.
2.21      The Fertilizer Industry Credit included several sub-projects mainly
for improving fertilizer production from existing p:Lants. There have been
delays in the start of some of the sub-projects. Replacement of those sub-
projects, not being implemented, by others with similar objectives was
approved by the Executive Directors in March 1978 (IDA/R78-23). The sub-
projects are now generally proceeding satisfactorily, As part of this
Fertilizer Industry Credit, three important studies relating to timel;y
availability of fertilizers to the farmers are being carried out.  The
National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) is carrying out a
Fertilizer Demand and Marketing Study which includes considerable field
survey. The draft report is nearing completion, and preliminary demand
projections have become available.  Rail India Technical and Economic Services
Ltd. (RITES) has completed a Fertilizer and Raw Material Transportation Study,
and the findings, after discussions with the industry, are now being reviewed
by the Government for the implementation of the recommendations. The Admin-
istrative Staff College, Hyderabad is carrying out a Fertilizer Warehousing
Study. Its draft report is scheduled to be availabLe to the Government
shortly.
2.22      Despite thes various difficulties, all the projects so far financed
by the Bank Group remain economically justified, in part due to substantial
increases in projected long-term international fertilizer prices ir real terms
since the projects were originally appraised. The Bank's major objective in
all the above projects has been to assist India in 'building up its domestic
fertilizer capacity. The Bank-financed projects have also aimed at improving
project management capabilities in the public sector, project implementation
time and fertilizer capacity utilization,  On the whole, these objectives have
been satisfactorily achieved, particularly in the more recent projects. At

the same time, considering that during the next ten years India plans to invest
over US$5.0 billion in new fertilizer production and related gas development
facilities and that t:he next generation of plants, to be based mainly on the
newly found offshore natural gas, would involve larger and more complex plants
than now existing in India, continued Bank assistance is necessary and justified.
III. THE RASHTRIYA CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS LIMITED (RCF)
3.01      Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers Limited (RCF), the proposed bor-
rower, is a new public sector fertilizer company which emerged from the re-
structuring of the public sector companies (para 2.18) and is responsible for
the operation of the Trombay unit (earlier with FCI) and the implementation
of the Project. RCF became an independent legal entity in April 1978. A
Government-appointed Board of Directors is responsible for the corporate
management of the Company and for coordination with the Government (Annex 3-1).
Most senior managers and technical personnel of RCF have been allocated and
appointed from the ECI staff. Trombay and Thal units of the Company will
operate as separate profit centers, each headed by a general manager.
3.02      The Trombay unit has shown good production performance with capacity
utilization consistently exceeding 80% of the capacity during the last six
years. The Trombay unit has also diversified and expanded its capacity to
include several industrial chemicals. The plant facilities now in operation
and under construction, along with the expected 1979 production, are shown
in Annex 3-2.
3.03      Since 1966, when the first plants were commissioned at Trombay,
several diversificat:ion and expansion projects, including production of
argon, concentrated nitric acid, sodium nitrate, ammonium bicarbonate and
methylamines have been implemented there. The Trombay unit has also com-
missioned a 100 tpd phosphoric acid plant and expanded the Suphala (NPK)
production to 330,000 tpy. The existing sulphuric acid plant has been con-
verted to the double catalyst process to expand capacity and reduce pollution.
Trombay IV - an IDA-financed project - is mechanically complete and is
currently being comnissioned. The Trombay V Proje,zt, which includes a
natural gas-based 900 tpd ammonia plant and a 1,000 tpd urea plant, is under
construction. All the above projects have been implemented satisfactorily,
though with some delays, by the staff and management of the Trombay unit.
The proposed Project will be managed by a team staffed mainly by those now
working on the Trombay expansion projects and having adequate capabilities
in project and construction management.
3.04      The good performance of the Trombay unit within FCI is also demon-
strated by the following table, which gives key financial indicators of the
Trombay unit, over the past four years (1975/76 to 1978/79). The relevant
full financial statements for the same period are shown in Annex 3-3.

RCF's financial position is expected to improve with the recent government
decision on fertilizer price revision (para. 2.16) which will increase RCF's
net realization price per ton of nitrophosphate by about 25%, combined with
the commissioning of new Trombay V facilities in 1981.
IV. FERTILIZER MARKET, MARKETING AND PRICES
A.   Fertilizer Use in Agriculture
4.01      With a cropped area of about 174 million hectares (ha), India
ranks third in the world in cultivated area (after the USSR and the US) and
has one of the two largest irrigated areas. About 72% of India's labor force
depends on agriculture, while only about 42% of the country's GDP is derived
from the agricultural sector. While the population increased annually at
about 2.0% during the decade ending in 1976, food-grain output increased during
the same period at 2.4% annually - about two-fifths each due to higher produc-
tivity and cropped area increase, and the balance due to crop pattern changes. 1/
Higher productivity was largely achieved with increased use of fertilizer and
irrigation, as well as the spreading cultivation of high yielding varieties
(HYV), particularly of wheat and rice.
4.02      India's total cropped area has been increasing for some time, mainly
with expansion of the multiple sown area. Between 1971 and 1978, gross cropped
area increased from 165 million to 174 million ha, of which about 75% is under
food-grain. Only a limited further increase in cropped area is planned in the
1/   Estimated on the basis of a regression equation.



- 14 -
next five years to 181 million ha in 1985.  Since possibilities of further
increases in cropped area are limited, food-grain production can only grow
significantly with increased productivity through more intensive use of water,
fertilizer and HYVs. Although per hectare fertilizer (total nutrients)
consumption has increased substantially in recent years, the 1978 all India
average of 25.0 kg/ha of arable land is still far below the level of consump-
tion (1977) of even some developing countries (Pakistan 32.3; Mexico 41.9;
Philippines 33.6; Egypt 175.1).
4.03      Fertilizer consumption is concentrated in a few states.  While
states such as the Punjab recorded total fertilizer nlutrient usage of 72.4
kg/ha in 1977/78, five others (Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Orissa, Bihar and
Maharashtra), which account for more than 45% of gross cropped area, used
less than 18 kg/ha (Annex 4-1). The same pattern emerges if the consumption
of nitrogenous fertilizer is examined. The following table, which arranges
the states in order of increasing nitrogenous fertilizer use intensity
(kg/ha), shows that the five states with the lowest use intensity account for
over 40% of the cropped area while consuming less than 18% of total nitrogen.
The five states with the highest use intensity account for less than 33% of
gross cropped area, but consume 60% of total nitrogen.

In the last three years, this concentration has diminished only slightly.
While some of this disparity is due to differences in climatic conditions
and irrigation availability, there is need to broaden the fertilizer demand
base by promoting increased fertilizer use in the low fertilizer consumption

areas and by less affluent farmers through improvement in farm management prac-
tices and farmer education. Preliminary findings of the NCAER Survey (para
2.21) have indicated that if the farmers have adequate and timely access to
the fertilizers and credit for buying it, the smaller farm owners take to
intensive fertilizer application as rapidly as the larger farm owners. Govern-
ment's plans include improved fertilizer availability nearer to the fertilizer
users (para 4.17) and better credit facilities for the smaller farmers (para
4.22). Government authorities believe that the highest future fertilizer
consumption growth will occur in areas other than those now having high
fertilizer application rates.
4.04      Nitrogenous fertilizer is available as four main products: urea
(46% N); ammonium sulphate (20.6% N); ammonium sulphate nitrate (26% N); and
calcium ammonium nitrate (21%-26%N). The pattern of consumption has changed
markedly over the years; in 1961/62 half the nitrogen was consumed in the
form of ammonium sulphate, with only 22% being supplied in the form of urea.
Since then, due to the cost savings in bagging, storage and transport per
unit of nutrient, high analysis material such as urea has been dominating
the market, with 72% of total nitrogenous fertilizers being supplied as urea.
The other straight nitrogenous fertilizers now account for only 14% of the
consumption, with about the same amount of nitrogen now being supplied in
the form of NPK complex fertilizers (Annex 4-2). A substantial part of the
nitrogenous fertilizer is applied directly as top dressing, and urea is often
preferred for this application. Urea is also compatible with diammonium
phosphate for the production of complex fertilizers used as basal dressing.
The selection of urea as the nitrogen fertilizer product by the Project is,
therefore, considered appropriate.
B.  Historical Growth of Fertilizer Consumption and Production

a/   All potash requirements are imported since there is no domestic production.
Consumption of plant nutrients increased annually at 22.9% in the decade
1961/62-71/72 and nitrogen at about 21.6%. Thereafter, nitrogen consumption
became static for three years (1972/73-74/75) due to sharp increases in prices
and poor monsoons but took off again in 1975/76 when nitrogen prices were
reduced, with a further upsurge between 1976/77 and 1978/79 reaching 3.42
million tons of nutrient by 1978/79. The nitrogen consumption growth rate
in the last four years has been about 18% per year. Consumption of phosphatic
fertilizers did not start recovering until 1976/77 but reached 1.04 million
tons of P 20  by 1978/79; potassic fertilizer consunmption recovered from the
slump only in 1977/78 and reached about 603,000 tpy of K 20 in 1978/79.
4.06       Fertilizer production in India increased significantly during the
last 15 years. Nitrogen production rose from 154,000 tons of nutrient in
1961/62 to 2.17 milLion tons in 1978/79, equivalent: to an average annual
growth rate of 17%. Phosphate production reached 771,000 tons of nutrient
in 1978/79, with an average annual growth rate of 16% over the same period.
The lower growth razes in the period 1971/72-76/77 compared with those in
the previous decade are associated with delays in project completion and lower
capacity utilizationa achieved after 1972/73 (para. 2.05).
4.07       Fertilizer production has generally lagged behind domestic consump-
tion as shown in the table of para 4.05. In the period 1971/72-77/78 annual
imports averaged 742,000 tons of N, 214,000 tons of P205 and 376,000 tons of K20.

(All potash requirements are imported as there is no domestic production).
Over this period nitrogen imports were equivalent to 36% of domestic consump-
tion, while phosphate imports were equivalent to 34% of domestic consumption.
The share of imports is expected to decline in the next five years. India's
fertilizer import policy is centered on supplementing domestic production with
imports to ensure adequate availability. The actual product mix of imports is
largely determined by availability and prices in the international market.
Greater emphasis is being given to import of fertilizers in bulk to reduce the
foreign exchange cost and to generate more local employment in bagging.

The above future fertilizer demand estimate has been prepared by the Bank
using the trend analysis, modified to allow for predicted changes in multi-
ple cropping practices, special irrigation programs, fertilizer promotion
campaigns and changes in materials in the pipeline from the producer to the
ultimate consumer. Three other estimates of future fertilizer demand, pre-
pared by the Fertilizer Association of India, the RCF and the Ministry of
Agriculture (Reference D, A and B - Project File), are presented along with
the Bank estimates in Annex 4-4. These estimates are more optimistic than
the Bank's estimates regarding future fertilizer demand. Preliminary esti-
mates of the NCAER's Fertilizer Demand Study (para 2.21) also place the
projected 1987/88 nitrogen demand at around 8.0 million tons. The Bank's



- 18 -
projected nitrogen demand growth rate for the period 1978/79-82/83 is 10.2% -
against 16.6% achieved in the period 1961/62-78/79. The Bank's estimated
1984/85 nitrogen demand, about 4% lower than the average of the other four
estimates, is considered reasonable.
4.09      The projected growth in fertilizer demand is based on several
assumptions. High fertilizer application levels are mainly in irrigated
areas cultivated with HYV seeds. In the period 1972-77, about half the
increase in fertilizer consumption was due to the increase in irrigated
area by 8 million ha and extension of the HYV area by 16 million ha. In the
likelihood of a slower than planned implementation of Government's irrigation
plans and HYV increases, the future fertilizer demand will be adversely
affected. As mentioned in para 4.03, the current fertilizer demand base is
narrow and will require to be broadened with adequate fertilizer supplies and
intensive promotion campaigns. The relative prices of the fertilizer to the
crops on which fertilizer is used were quite high in the early 1960s, but
fell during the 1960s and early 1970s. The recovery of the fertilizer demand
indicates that increased fertilizer application is still profitable to the
farmer. The demand forecasts assume that the price ratios will continue at
the present or improved levels. Increase in effective fertilizer demand
also requires strengthening of credit institutions, since about 70% of the
fertilizer purchases are on credit. The above constraints to fertilizer
consumption have also been identified during the Bank's economic work and
are taken into consideration in the Government's programs for promoting
fertilizer consumption.
4.10      The fertilizer production estimates given in para 4.08 take into
account plants already in operation, under construction and firmly planned
(Annex 2-1). The estimates include production from the three major projects
now in the planning stage and expected to come on stream by 1984/85 - Kakinada
(228,000 tpy N), Namrup III (152,000 tpy N) and Surat (624,000 tpy N); the
proposed Surat Project, similar in scope to the proposed Project, is also
being considered for Bank financing. The newer plants are assumed to operate
at 90% of their capacity from their third year of operation. For the older
and problem plants, past performance and the effect of modification schemes
have been reviewed to assess the likely production levels. An allowance has
also been made for possible losses in production due to unforeseen factors and
somewhat lower capacity utilization in the coal-based plants. The projected
production in 1985 is about 85% of the overall nitrogen and phosphate capaci-
ties and is considered achievable if the Government continues its efforts, as
is expected, to irLcrease capacity utilization (paras 2.07 to 2.11).
4.11      The comparison of nitrogen demand and production estimates shown
in para 4.08 indicates that a shortfall in domestic supply is likely to
continue. The above table also shows that even including production from
the planned new projects - Thal, Kakinada, Surat and Namrup III - the pro-
jected demand will be higher than anticipated production by about 12% in 1985.
If nitrogenous fertilizer demand during 1978/79-1984/85 grows only at 9%
annually, instead of the 10.2% derived from the Bank projections, due to the
constraints mentioned in para 4.09 and even assuming that there will be no



- 19 -
slippage in the completion of new plants, production will be just adequate
to meet demand; thus indicating that not only the Project but also the other
large plants now being planned will be required.
D.   Ammonia
4.12      At 90% production level, the Project is expected to have 26,730 tpy
of excess ammonia available for sale to other fertilizer plants and industrial
users. At current production levels of existing facilities and 90% production
levels of the Trombay IV and Trombay V plants (now being commissioned and
expected to come on stream in 1983, respectively), Trombay will have a short-
fall of 50,000 tpy which it intends to meet partly with ammonia from Thal
supplemented with imports. The Cochin II NPK fertilizer plant presently
operating on imported ammonia, also requires about 50,000 tpy of ammonia at
its rated capacity, and some additional ammonia will be needed in the Cochin I
facilities to improve urea production. Even at 80% production level at least
40,000 tpy of ammonia would be used in the Cochin plants.
4.13      In addition, potential industrial users for Thal's ammonia include
the Hindustan Organic Chemicals Ltd. and explosives producers, who will respec-
tively use 6,000 tpy and 4,000 tpy of ammonia for nitric acid production.
There is, thus, an identified market for about 100,000 tpy of ammonia.
Furthermore, a committee formed by the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers
has recommended the construction of three major phosphatic fertilizer plants,
which together will require about 240,000 tpy of ammonia. The Bank's own
analysis of India's phosphatic fertilizer supply and demand situation in the
early/mid-1980s establishes the need for at least one of these plants to be
commissioned by 1982/83. Thus, there should be no difficulty in finding an
adequate market for the Project's ammonia. The pool of ammonia tank wagons
now available with RCF will be adequate for moving the ammonia to the
industrial buyers and to Trombay.
E.   Marketing and Distribution in the Project's Market Area
1.   Distribution Model
4.14      As part of an overall fertilizer transportation study (Reference F -
Project File), a joint group of the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers and
the Railway Board developed a preliminary overall fertilizer distribution
strategy keeping in view the new capacities in the Western region of India.
The underlying methodology in developing the overall distribution plan took
into account the following major considerations: (i) to minimize cross
movements of similar fertilizer products from different producers, (ii) as far
as possible, to move fertilizer in unit train loads to reduce movement time
and (iii) to avoid where possible transhipment from one gauge to another. The
distribution plan also aimed at (a) minimizing the average freight of the
individual fertilizer producing units, (b) spreading out dispatches uniformly
throughout the year, (c) keeping in view market requirement of various products
and market size, (d) ensuring that no factory relies entirely on the market in



- 20 -
only one state and no state draws its entire requirements from one plant,
and (e) ensuring that there are no radical changes from year to year on the
marketing areas of 'the individual producers. These considerations are the
same as those used by the Government in developing biannual plans for allo-
cation and movement of fertilizers in zonal conferences. The findings of a
preliminary study relating to the producing plants in the western region and
imports through Kanila and Bombay prepared by an inter-ministerial group are
summarized in Annex 4-5. As may be seen from the annex and Map IBRD 14284,
the major markets in 1984/85 proposed by this study for the project output
will be Maharashtra mainly supplied by road, and Uttar Pradesh supplied by
movement through the Central Railway system. Given the large projected gaps
between demand and production in Northern States by 1984/85, a large part of
the production from the plants based on the Bombay High gas and of imports
would be marketed in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana. While
plants located in Gujarat would move the fertilizer through the Western
Railway system mainly to Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, the project output
not consumed in Maharashtra would be transported through the Central Railway
system to Uttar Pradesh. As demand grows in the Southern States during the
late 1980s, a part of the project output is likely to be sold in the Southern
States again through the Central Railway system. The Government is expected
to further review and discuss with the Bank more detailed findings of the
inter-ministerial group, which are expected in late 1979.
2.   Marketing Organization
4.15      Until the mid-1960s, all fertilizers were distributed by the Gov-
ernment Central Fertilizer Pool; a revised policy instituted in 1965 permitted
domestic fertilizer units to market their products, while the Pool continued
to distribute imported materials (except potash, which is distributed by
Indian Potash Limited). The marketing organization of FCI, which was set up
in 1966, grew rapidly and by 1977 had a network of over 4,500 dealers, each
covering a Block 1/ of about 100 villages with an average of about five retail
outlets. In accordance with government policy about half of the sales are
made through cooperatives and other institutional outlets, while the rest is
distributed through the private sector. With the restructuring of FCI, its
Western Marketing Division, which was responsible for marketing the Trombay's
products, has become part of RCF.
4.16      Although RCF already has an established marketing organization it
recognizes that co-nsiderable strengthening and expansion of the services,
especially in Uttar Pradesh, will be necessary to meet its future marketing
needs. An increase in Western Marketing Division's marketing staff by 150
people is envisaged. Currently, over 2,000 dealers market RCF products
(Reference B and C - Project File); this number is expected to increase to
over 4,500 by the early 1980s. RCF's market promotion, in operation for
several years under FCI, already includes programs such as field demonstra-
tions, free soil testing services, "fertilizer festivals," mass training
programs for farmers at the village level, crop care services, experimental
trials, agronomic guidance, and comprehensive services to selected villages.
1/   Administrative unit corresponding to a county.



- 21 -
The programs are implemented in coordination with the state governments, which
already have extension programs of their own. Many states are reorganizing
and strengthening their extension services through training and visits, and
extension reorganization in most states is receiving Bank consideration for
assistance.
4.17      The Government's pricing policy on urea allows a margin of Rs
100/ton to private dealers and Rs 115/ton to cooperative and other insti-
tutional buyers. While this margin continues to be adequate if the fertilizer
is distributed close to railheads, the margin does not include adequate
incentives to extend the marketing to areas away from railheads. The Govern-
ment and the industry do not favor a general increase in the dealer's margin,
since such an increase, while providing a larger profit to the dealers, may
still not encourage the marketing of fertilizers in interior locations. The
Government is aware of the importance of modifying the fertilizer price
build-up to promote its increased use in areas away from the Indian railway
system. The Government plans to rely mainly on promotional and extension
efforts in these areas to develop increased fertilizer consumption and to
encourage the growth of a dealership network to make the fertilizer more
easily available. As against the notional freight provisions of Rs 38 per
ton used earlier as the urea pricing formula, the Government now reimburses
the manufacturer with the actual freight based on the previous years's average
freight for delivery to the dealers. This measure is expected to remove the
constraint of inadequate freight provision on the marketing of fertilizers
at locations away from the railway network.
3.   Product Movement
4.18      Current expectations indicate that only about 10% of the Project's
urea output may be moved out of Thal by road; this proportion could be ex-
pected to increase in later years, but would most likely not exceed 15%. The
remaining urea and ammonia will be moved by rail. Because of the seasonal
nature of fertilizer demand, up to 200,000 tons per month of urea may have
to be moved by rail, equivalent to 200-250 wagon loads per day. The Railway
authorities have studied the strengthening of the Railway systems required to
handle the large fertilizer movement from the Western region. Certain impor-
tant line capacity works such as provision of a third line on each of the two
ghat sections of the Central Railway, doubling on the Nagda-Kota Section of
the Western Railway, automatic signalling on the Mathura-Palwal Section and
remodelling of the Jalgaon and Bhusawal yards, are already in progress but
would have to be speeded up. These schemes will require an allocation of
about Rs 100 million (US$ 12 million) during the next three years and would
be part of the normal Railway plans. In addition, certain works of yard
modelling and strengthening of track capacity on the concerned sections of
the Central and Western Railways have to be planned and executed as soon as
possible. These will include improvement in track standard and capacity of
the Apta-Panvel-Dina Section, development of the Panvel yard, bypass lines at
Dina and Vadodara, additional bypass lines at Godhra and Ratlam, intermediate
block signalling works on the Kalyan-Kasara, Igatpuri-Jalgaon, Udhua-Vadodara,
Kandla-Anand-Godhra, Godhra-Ratlam, Mathura-Palwal and Udhna-Jalgaon Sections



- 22 -
and a third line on the Jalgaon-Bhusawal Section. The above schemes will
require another Rs 300 million (US$35 million) during the next three years.
Agreement has been reached with the Government that it will take all actions
necessary to provide the railway facilities adequate for the movement of raw
materials required for the Project and for finished products to be manufac-
tured at the Thal Unit, in accordance with a program agreed upon with the
Bank. The Government has also confirmed that it will take all actions
necessary to ensure that adequate railway wagons are available to RCF for the
operation of the Thal Unit at full capacity. Wagon allocation for fertilizer
movement has a high priority and is coordinated by the Ministry of Agriculture.
The urea will be moved in bags since specially designed wagons for bulk ship-
ment of urea are not available, but the Railways intend to carry out investi-
gations on suitable systems so that the open rail wagons bringing in coal can
be used to move out urea. Railhead warehousing space will be used to mitigate
extreme seasonal fluctuations. Warehouse capacity for about 150,000 tons,
which is already available, will be rented from the Central and State Ware-
housing Corporations. While no major difficulties are expected in the trans-
port and storage of the Project's output, due to the number of government
entities involved, RCF will have to plan in advance for the required fertilizer
warehousing.  RCF has agreed to provide the Bank with its detailed plans for
warehousing the Thal urea before December 31, 1980.
4.   Fertilizer Credit
4.19      Credit in fertilizer marketing is needed at two stages:  (i) credits
for farmers to enable them to invest in inputs until the harvest is sold; and
(ii) distribution credits to the dealers for stocking fertilizers at various
points. Farm credits come from three official soturces - cooperatives, commer-
cial banks and government short-term credit.  The village moneylender still
plays a, though diminishing, role in providing loans.  Although credit has
been expanding, there are indications that it is still insufficient to cover
the needs.  In facd, the cooperatives are consistently falling short of their
lending targets, and other sources are not filling the gap, in many instances
for reasons other than shortage of funds e.g., Reserve Bank of India restric-
tions because of high overdues.
4.20      Credit riequirements for fertilizers in 1978 were estimated at
Rs 10,500 million (US$1,220 million) by the Ministry of Agriculture, on
the assumption that 70% of total fertilizer sales are made on credit. The
Government aims at substantially increasing credit available to the agri-
cultural sector, both for fertilizers and other purposes, by progressively
institutionalizing the sources of credit and adopting a multiple agency
approach. The cooperative sector provides about 80% of the agricultural
credit. Short-term credit through the cooperatives increased from Rs 7,830
million (US$910 million) in 1975 to about Rs 13,400 million (US$1,560 million)
in 1978. The cooperative credit is expected to increase to Rs 25,000 million
(US$2,910 million) by 1983, out of which about Rs 16,500 million (US$1,920
million) will be available for fertilizers. The government plans aim at
increasing the share of credit going to small farmers (owning less than 2 ha



- 23 -
of land each, totalling 70% of the farm holdings) from the existing level of
30% to 50%. Agriculture Refinance and Development Corporation schemes now
cover most of the districts in India.
4.21      The share of commercial banks for agricultural credit continues
to be relatively meager, mainly due to the banks' unwillingness to enter into
high risk areas. Their lending procedures, though gradually improving, still
involve delays in clearance, emphasis on provision of security, and high
margins on credit advanced. On the other hand, the role of cooperatives--
especially the cooperative banks--in providing credit has been increasing
over the years. Although they cover only a small section of the rural popula-
tion, cooperatives are the major organized source of agricultural finance.
An agricultural credit intensive development scheme has been taken up by the
state governments in some 40 districts. Under this scheme, the structure of
some 10-15% of the cooperative credit institutions will be strengthened on a
selective basis for intensive agricultural credit.
4.22      Institutional agencies and private dealers engaged in fertilizer
distribution receive distribution credits from the suppliers. For imported
fertilizers, the Central Fertilizer Pool allows 55 days credit to re-allottees
of the state governments, while private manufacturers allow credit ranging
from 15-60 days to dealers and cooperatives. RCF intends to ease its standard
secured credit terms (currently 30 days) to distributors to 45 days credit.
The rate of interest on distribution credit ranges between 14.5% and 15% p.a.,
although some of the commercial banks have charged as much as 18% p.a. These
rates are high compared to interest rates charged elsewhere in the economy.
Adequate and timely availability of both production and distribution credit
is essential to widen the demand base of fertilizer districts where fertilizer
usage is still limited. The Government's fertilizer credit plans will signi-
ficantly affect fertilizer consumption growth rates; current constraints in
credit availability have been considered in deriving fertilizer demand fore-
casts in para 4.08.
F.   Product Prices
4.23      As mentioned, urea and other straight nitrogenous fertilizer prices
are statutorily controlled by the Government. The retail price of urea, which
had remained virtually stable since the mid sixties, increased sharply in 1973
and again in 1974. Contrary to expectations that fertilizer price increases
would not depress demand, fertilizer offtake continued to fall during the 1975
Kharif season, despite ideal rainfall conditions. In response to this the
urea price was first reduced in July 1975 and further reductions have been
made since that time with the retail price now standing at Rs 1,450/ton.
The following table compares urea retail prices in India (exclusive of local
sales tax) with the (notional) prices of urea on the basis of CIF India prices
plus an average margin for port handling and internal distribution within the
country, exclusive of import duties.

March 1979                       1,311              1,530            (219)
a/   Excludes excise duty, pool equalization surcharge and local taxes
totalling Rs 239 in February 1977 and Rs 139 from March 1979.
From the above table it can be deduced that the domestic retail prices have
been generally in line with import prices except during 1973-75, when import
prices were much higher.
4.24      With the rise in equipment costs and raw material prices - both in
India and internationally - it became apparent that the prices received by
the Indian urea manufacturers since 1974 were inadequate and, therefore,
discouraged investnent in new capacity. A committee under the chairmanship
of Mr. S. S. Marathe, set up in 1976 to develop a rational system of pricing,
recommended a system of retention prices for individual production units in
the nitrogenous fertilizer industry. The system introduced in November 1977
allows an ex-works retention price per ton of urea, for each producing unit,
based on efficient operation at 80% capacity utilization, an after tax return
of 12% or a before tax return of 28.4% on net worth, whichever is higher. The
part of the sale price retained by the industry is at present Rs 1,158/ton of
urea. The difference between the retail price (Rs 1,450/ton) and the price
retained by the producers (Rs 1,158/ton) covers excise duty, the Fertilizer
Pool Equalization Charge, freight and dealer's margin as shown below.

Manufacturers with allowed ex-works prices (so-called retention prices) lower
than Rs 1,158/ton are required to credit the difference to a Fertilizer Price
Fund account, which is used to reimburse those producers whose allowed prices
are higher than Rs 1,158/ton.
4.25      Deducting the freight and dealer's margin elements (Rs 38 and Rs 115
per ton, respectively) - which are cost elements outside the factory - from
the retail price (Rs 1,450/ton) gives Rs 1,297/ton which can be viewed as a
surrogate ex-factory price or farmer price less distribution cost. This
price can then be compared with the average producer retention price and the
cost of imported fertilizer to determine if there are any subsidies in the
system. The estimate of the average allowed retention price to be received
by the fertilizer industry in March 1979 was Rs 1,462/ton while the landed
cost of urea, which may be viewed as the opportunity cost, was Rs 1,530/ton
(at current prices). Thus, in March 1979:

)      68   )
Opportunity cost of urea         1,530      )           )
The above indicates that while the farmer paid ex-factory Rs 233/ton of urea
less than the landed price, the industry received Rs 68/ton less than the
landed cost of urea. In early 1979, the Government extended the pricing
scheme to complex fertilizers also. The new policy substantially improves
the financial situation of the manufacturers and at the same time maintains
fertilizer prices attractive to farmer. The Government is reviewing several
improvements to the pricing scheme to speed up price adjustments following
cost escalations and to provide a minimum capital base equal to the equity
funds for purposes of calculating the return on the capital employed. The
Government has agreed that it will not take or cause to be taken any action
which, assuming production under conditions of efficient operation, would
prevent fertilizer manufacturers from meeting all their expenses, servicing
their debts, and earning a reasonable return on invested capital.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Project Scope and Location
5.01      The Project consists of two natural gas-based ammonia units, with a
capacity of 1,350 tpd each, and three urea units with a capacity of 1,500 tpd
each. It is part of an overall plan to use most economically the associated
and non-associated gas from the recently developed Bombay High and South
Bassein offshore oil and gas fields, which as mentioned were partly financed
by a Bank loan (Loan 1473-IN). Based on 330 stream days per year operations,



- 26 -
the project facilities will be designed to produce 1,485,000 tpy of urea and
29,700 tpy of ammonia at 100% rated capacity. The saleable ammonia will be
produced partly as a result of the gas composition, which does not allow full
conversion of ammonia produced in the synthesis section into urea for lack of
carbon dioxide and partly due to the possible differences in stream effic-
iencies between the ammonia and urea plants.
5.02      The proposed ammonia plant will be the largest steam reforming
unit yet to be built in India, even though similar capacity plants are suc-
cessfully in operation elsewhere. A steam reformation plant of 1,100 tpd
capacity is operating satisfactorily at Tuticorin in India after some of the
heat exchangers, considered inadequate, were replaced.   A fuel oil-based
ammonia plant of 1,350 tpd capacity is currently under construction near
Broach in India. The use of the larger ammonia pLant capacity as compared to
the previously mores common 900 tpd capacity is expected to reduce the project
cost by about US$30 million and improve the economic rate of return by about
0.7 percentage points. Based on experience available in and outside India,
the larger plant capacity will not significantly increase the technical risks,
either during construction or during operation. The Project also includes all
necessary auxiliary and offsite facilities for smooth and efficient operation,
such as steam boilers, power generators for critical services, product storage
and loading facilities, and maintenance shops.
5.03      In addition, a substantial portion of the infrastructure, (consist-
ing principally of township, rail spur and power link), estimated to cost
about US$26 million, has been included in the project scope, as the project
site is located in an undeveloped area (para 5.04). Investment in a rail spur
will be ultimately shared by other economic and commercial developments that
may be located in the area, and half of the advances for the power line will
be adjusted against the tariff for power supply from the grid. The plant
layout is shown in Map IBRD 14246, and the location of the Project and related
infrastructure in Map IBRD 14286.
5.04      The Project will be constructed at Thal, in the district of Kolaba,
Maharashtra, 25 km south of Bombay (Map IBRD 14286) and 20 km from Uran,
where the pipeline terminal for the off shore Bombay High fields will be
located. Various plant locations north and south of Bombay were considered.
The selection of Thal as the ultimate project site followed a survey and
evaluation of altiernative sites in the region carried out by a government
constituted expert team (References A and G - the Project File), and is based
on the following major factors: (i) comparative closeness to the gas terminal
at Uran; (ii) low land development cost; (iii) advantages of a seaside loca-
tion with respect to the transportation of equipnent and the disposal of
liquid effluents after treatment; and (iv) location outside the command area
for irrigation, not agriculturally important and away from large communities.
After a detailed evaluation of the findings of the team by Senior State and
Central Government officials, RCF and the Government decided on the selection
of Thal as the project site. The Bank has carefully reviewed the government
decision on the selection and has confirmed that the Thal site is acceptable,
from technical, economic and environmental point of view (para 5.17).



- 27 -
5.05      About 320 ha are available at Thal for the Project and additional
land is available nearby for the development of a company township for its
employees. A Special Land Acquisition Officer, appointed by the Maharashtra
Government, was entrusted with the responsibility of land acquisition for
the Project. The project authorities already have completed acquisition of
the land and have full access to the site. Detailed soil investigation work
of the entire area has also been completed.
B.   Gas and Coal Supply
1.   Gas
5.06      As noted above, the natural gas required for the Project will be
supplied by the Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) from the Bombay High
and Bassein fields located about 160 km and 100 km, respectively, offshore of
Bombay. At present the offshore fields have total proven recoverable reserves
of oil estimated at about 250 million tons with an additional 85 million tons
likely if "probable" reserves are confirmed. The availability of associated
gas from the two fields is expected to rise gradually in line 'ith the fields'
oil production from about 0.35 million normal cubic meters (Nm ) yer day in
mid-1978, to 1.75 million Nm per day in 1980 and 2.70 million Nm per day
by 1982-83, when oil production would reach the planned level of 8.2 million
tpy (180,000 barrels/day). In addition, tMe South Bassein fields are antici-
pated to produce up to about 10 million Nm per day of non-associated gas.
5.07      The first two phases of development of the reserves have been com-
pleted, and the crude oil production is now about 3.9 million tpy (or 80,000
barrels per day). The associated gas is now used in the Trombay fertilizer
plants and the Tata thermal power station. The third phase of this devel-
opment, partly financed by the Bank (Bombay High Oil Development Project:
Loan No. 1473-IN) consists of the drilling of about 20 development wells
and the construction of five well platforms to raise production to 7 mil-
lion tpy (140,000 barrels per day) as well as the construction of three
processing platforms, permanent pipeline transport facilities and shore
facilities. Phases IV and V will include additional facilities to develop
the capacity to the planned 1982-83 level of 8.2 million tpy. The entire
program is expected to be completed by the early 1980s.
5.08      The oil pipeline system included in Phase III consists of submarine
and land pipeline at a total cost of US$138 million and has an ultimate
capacity of 29 million tpy. The system also includes gas pipelines linking
Bombay High through the Bassein fields to Uran and linking Uran with Trombay
(Map IBRD 13340R). The gas pipeline system, estimated to cost US$111.5 mil-
lion, has a capacity of 7.5 million Nm per day. The pipeline projects
were completed in May 1978. To supply gas to the Project, ONGC will build
at its own cost (estimated at US$10 million) a 10 km long 18" diameter



- 28 -
pipeline from the t[ran gas terminal to Thal. The Government is also proposing
to connect the free gas wells in South Bassein to the gas pipeline system.
The pipeline and this connection can also be completed within 12 months.
5.09      The shore terminal at Uran will include a crude stabilization unit,
a gas processing plant and storage facilities.  The offshore associated and
non-associated gas conveyed by the pipeline and the gas produced at the crude
stabilization unit will be processed in a gas fractionation plant. The plant
will initially be a liquefied petroleum gas recovery unit but will be designed
so that additional facilities can be added later when demand develops for
petrochemical feedStocks. The methane rich residual gas, piped to the Trombay
and Tha'L fertilizer plants, will have the following approximate composition:
methane 93.0%, ethane 5.0%, propane 0.5%, butane 0.1% and inerts 1.4%. Gas
with the above analysis, is suitable for ammonia production by the steam
reformation process. The gas will be supplied to the Project at the battery
limit at a pressure of 43 atmospheres, which is adequate.
5.10       t full capacity operation, the Project will require about 2.8
million Nm  per day of natural gas, and the Government has allocated this
quantity to the Project. RCF has initialled an agreement with ONGC for the
gas supply. The gas price has been determined by the Government on parity
with delivered naphtha cost (about Rs 590/ton) based on the recommendations
of a government committee, and is expected to be about Rs 626/ 1,000 Nm , in
1978 rupees (equivalent to Rs 878 in 1983/84 rupees). As the needs of poten-
tial customers already identified exceed expected associated gas production
and to ensure that the Project's production is not dependent on maximum oil
production at all times, ONGC has agreed to connect the South Bassein gas wells
to the Uran pipeline before January 1, 1982. ONGC has also agreed to complete
the gas pipeline from the Uran terminal to the Thal project site before
June 30, 1981.  The agreement includes adequate provisions for increasing the
gas supply, when, for environmental reasons, the boilers have to use gas
instead of coal. Agreement has been reached with RCF that conclusion of a
satisfactory gas supply contract with ONGC, which would include contract
quantity and quality as well as arrangements for tying-ins of the non-
associated gas fields and for contingency gas supply for steam generation,
will be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan. Finally, assurances
have also been obtained from the Government that it will ensure adequate
supplies of natural gas for the Project.
2.   Coal
5.11      Grade I coal (with 19-22% ash and 0.3-0.7% sulphur) will be used
to generate the steam required in the urea plant as well as for captive power
generation; use of coal is consistent with government policy that restricts
the use of gas to feedstock only and promotes use of domestic coal for power
generation. The allocation of Grade I coal to the Project is in recognition
of the Government's anxiety to keep down the particulate matter and sulphur
dioxide contents of the steam generation unit stack emissions. About 1,800
tpd of coal needed by the Project will come from the Bisrampur, Kumda and



- 29 -
Bhatgaon coal fields of Central India, about 800 km from Thal. As confirmed
by the Railway authorities, coal transport from those coal fields to Thal is
not expected to pose problems especially after the third railway track now
under construction across the Western Ghats is completed by 1980/81. RCF
and Coal India Ltd. have been authorized by the Government to conclude the
commercial agreement for the coal supply. RCF has initialled a 6ctisfactory
agreement for coal supply and will sign it as a condition of effectiveness
of the Bank loan. The coal supply contract will include the quantity
and quality of coal supply and linkage with the supplying collieries. Agree-
ment has been reached with the Government that it will assure adequate sup-
plies of coal for the Project.
C.   Utilities and Infrastructure
1.   Power
5.12      The Project will require about 30 MW of power, of which 15 MW will
be generated within the plant to meet the Project's critical process require-
ments, and the rest will be supplied from the grid of the Maharashtra State
Electricity Board (MSEB). The outside power supply is not expected to become
a bottleneck as adequate additional state grid capacity is under implementa-
tion. To transmit the power to the site, a double 220 KV line will be laid
between the Apta substation of MSEB and Thal over a distance of about 48 km
(Map IBRD 14286). MSEB has asked RCF to provide Rs 20.6 million (US$2.4
million) as an advance against the full power line cost; later half of the
above amount will be credited against power charges. An initial payment of Rs
1.5 million has been made by RCF, and the MSEB is proceeding with the arrange-
ments for power supply. The Project will also have two power generators,
including one as standby, to meet the requirements of the two ammonia plants
and related offsites. These arrangements are necessary to ensure that ammonia
plants--which are more difficult and time consuming to restart than the rest
of the plants--continue operating during external power interruptions/
fluctuations. The generators will be adequately sized so that with both
generators in operation all process plants and related facilities can be
operated on self-generated power. RCF has agreed to conclude a satisfactory
power supply contract with MSEB, which would include the quantum of power
supply and the schedule for the Apta-Thal transmission line, as a condition of
effectiveness of the Bank loan.
2.   Water
5.13      The estimated total water requirements of the Project are 20 mil-
lion gallons/day (Mgd), including one Mgd for the township. The Maharashtra
Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) will be responsible for implementing
a water supply scheme based on water from the nearby river, Amba. A barrage
(dam) across the Amba River will be constructed by the State Irrigation
Department for MIDC which would construct the intake works, the 32 km pipeline
and the filtration plant. The investment requirements of the Amba water
scheme are estimated at Rs 100 million (US$12 million) which will be financed
from the internal resources of MIDC (Rs 15 million), by bonds floated to the
public (Rs 10 million) and a loan of Rs 75 million from the State Bank of
India. With an annual capital works program of MIDC of about Rs 120 million,



- 30 -
MIDC should be able to mobilize the necessary financial resources for the
water supply project. MIDC has already invited bids for steel plates and for
pipe fabrication work. Agreement has been reached that RCF will conclude with
MIDC a satisfactory contract for the water supply, which should include the
supply quantity and MIDC schedule for completing the supply arrangements, as
a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan.
3.   Other Infrastructure
5.14      The infrastructure needs of the Project include the gas pipeline from
Uran, the construction of a 45 km railway spur between Apta railway station
and the project site, strengthening of the road between Khopoli and Thal,
and the water supply scheme (para 5.13). These facilities will be shared by
other economic developments expected to be located later in the region. In
addition, the Project includes a township (financed and implemented within the
Project), and powerline from Apta. The total infrastructure development cost
is estimated at about Rs 350 million (US$40 million). The implementation
schedule for the major facilities is shown in Annesx 5-1. In particular, the
construction of the railway spur is critical for movement of the finished
product (urea) and raw materials, especially coal and fertilizer bags. The
third railway track, which would relieve the track capacity constraints on
moving material across the Western Ghats, is expected to be completed by
December 1981. The three major bridges on the Apta-Penn Section are already
under construction, and the railway line is expected to be completed by June
1980. Survey work on the siding from Penn to Thal, to be financed within the
Project, is nearing completion. Contract for the bridge on river Amba has
been awarded and soil testing work is in progress. The railway siding, with
a total estimated cost of Rs 78 million (US$9.1 million), is scheduled for
completion by June 1981. Finally, road strengthening work mainly for the
movement of construction materials and equipment to the project site is
already being carried out by the State Government and will be completed in
time. The Maharashtra State Government has provided satisfactory written
confirmation to the Government of India that it will ensure that all concerned
State government agencies are given the necessary facilities and resources to
complete the water supply scheme, the power connection and the road restruc-
turing works in time for the Project.
D.   Operational Manpower and Training
5.15      The Project will employ about 1,565 people most of whom will be
skilled or semi-skilled technicians. The staff will be recruited from the
existing fertilizer and chemical plants in the Bombay area as well as from
the Kolaba region in which the Project is located. Indirect employment of
up to 5,000 people is expected in transportation, marketing and communica-
tions. Preliminary training plans for the technical operating and maintenance
staff have been prepared and will be finalized before December 31, 1979. The
Indian fertilizer industry presently employs about 60,000 people including
about 9,000 managers and supervisors. About 75% of this employment is in the
public sector including ex-FCI units. The key managers and supervisors needed



- 31 -
for the Project will be drawn from existing public sector companies; if nec-
essary, they will be trained overseas in ammonia and urea plants similar to
the Project. The invitations for proposals for ammonia and urea process
consultants include provisions for such training outside India.
5.16      The remaining staff will be recruited from technical universities
and schools and trained in three categories - engineers/managers, supervisors
and technicians. RCF has well equipped and staffed training centers in its
plants at Trombay. After initial orientation in the training centers, the
trainees will be allocated to specific responsibilities and trades and given
on-the-job training in RCF's plants. The trainees, most of whom will come
from RCF's Trombay Training Center, will be in Thal well before the various
project units are ready for testing and commissioning, to become familiar-
ized with these units and with their operating and maintenance instructions.
Several of the maintenance supervisors and technicians will participate
in the erection and testing of the specialized equipment. RCF has already
hired an experienced Training Manager to formulate its training plans for the
operational staff of the Project. RCF has agreed that it will complete and
discuss with the Bank the detailed training plans before December 31, 1979,
and subsequently take timely action to implement the plan.
E.   Environmental Aspects
5.17      Considering that the Project will create a major industry in a
relatively underdeveloped and rural area, the Bank has carefully reviewed
all environmental aspects during the appraisal of the Project to ensure that
project design and location will not adversely affect the region. The major
potential pollutants from the complex are ammonia and urea from the main
process plants and the fly ash dust and sulfur dioxide from the coal fired
boilers. The only other important effluent will be the waste from the
water treatment and demineralizing facilities. The plants will be designed
and engineered to minimize the introduction of ammonia and urea into the
liquid effluent streams. Effluents containing ammonia and urea will be
collected separately, hydrolyzed to decompose the urea to ammonia and stripped.
The effluent leaving the plants will contain less than 25 ppm of ammonia and
200 ppm of urea. The urea dust escape from the prilling tower into the
atmosphere will be reduced by scrubbing the dust laden gases with water. The
combined liquid effluent of the Project will be monitored, treated suitably
and let into the sea. The coal fired boilers will use Grade I coal and will
change over to natural gas if and when the particulate level from coal burning
exceeds agreed levels. The boilers fitted with electrostatic precipitators
and stacks of minimum 150 meters height will minimize fly ash dust allowed
into the atmosphere. The pollution control and monitoring arrangements
planned by the Project have been reviewed by the Maharashtra Prevention of
Water Pollution Board, which has issued a no-objection certificate prescribing
the norms and conditions to be followed by the Project (Annex 5-2). The
prescribed norms are generally in conformity with internationally accepted
standards and in some cases are even more stringent. The Bank staff have
reviewed the arrangements made for the Project and the norms prescribed by
the State authorities, and are satisfied that the standards can be met and



- 32 -
that the pollution levels stated previously are within these norms and are
acceptable to the Bank.  The pollution control measures adopted for the
project were also reviewed by independent specialized consultants from the
International Fertilizer Development Center, who have confirmed (Reference H -
Project File) that these measures along with implementation of certain other
recommendations will assure that the Thal facilities can be operated with
pollution levels well within acceptable limits. Assurances have been obtained
from RCF that all the required measures will be adopted. RCF has agreed to
appoint before December 31, 1979 competent independent consultants satisfactory
to the Bank to design overall project pollution control systems, and present
the designs for review by the Bank before June 30, 1980. RCF will install a
sufficient number of monitoring stations in the area and employ a qualified
manager to be in charge of implementing the pollution control measures and
continuing to monitor them. RCF's training plans for the operating and
maintenance personnel will include adequate emphasis on the importance of
adequate pollution monitoring and control.
5.18      Safety norms in industrial plants are formulated and monitored in
India by the State Inspectorate of Factories. The plant design and plans
will be reviewed by the State authorities, as part of their normal industrial
safety responsibilities, for conformity with these norms. The Project's
firefighting system includes emergency pumps, overhead reservoir and fire
hydrants. The system will also include facilities for fighting chemical
fires. As Indian practice requires, these systems for the Project will be
engineered to standards prescribed by the state-owned General Insurance
Company, which are satisfactory. RCF's staffing will include a qualified and
trained safety officer assisted by safety and fire fighting personnel. Key
operating and maintenance staff will be given training in safety and fire-
fighting. Operating and maintenance manuals prepared by the engineering firms
will be reviewed by RCF engineers for safety considerations to include required
procedures to handle accidents. Training of RCF's operating and maintenance
personnel will also include adequate emphasis on plant and personnel safety.
5.19      The project site has been identified keeping in view the importance
of minimizing adverse environmental and social impact on the community.
Except for one family in a small orchard, no other families are living within
the plant site. However, 366 families own land within the project site and
will lose part or whole of their land holdings. The State Government has
reached agreement with the farmers on the level of adequate compensation for
the acquired land and RCF has accepted the above level, which is significantly
higher than the land prices in the area. The State Government and RCF have
each appointed a Rehabilitation Officer who will assist the families concerned
in relocation. These officers have completed a survey of the families to
identify their members who can be provided employment in the Project, after
suitable training if required. RCF has undertaken to provide employment
to at least one person from each family whose land has been partially or
entirely acquired. Assurances have been obtainec from RCF that it will
continue to employ as long as necessary its Rehabilitation Officer to assist
the affected families in their relocations. The State Government, through its



- 33 -
Development Corporation of Konkan, will assist the above families to promote
self-employment ventures by providing up to 15% of seed money as grant and
assisting in obtaining commercial bank financing for 75% of the remaining
needs for schemes costing up to Rs 100,000.
5.20      The growth in economic and commercial activity in the area following
the Project could rapidly increase the population in the nearby Alibag town.
The Government of Maharashtra has provided assurances that it will keep a
close watch on the impact of the Project on neighboring Alibag town and ensure
that adequate water supply, sewerage and other civic amenities are developed
in time, so that the possible increase in Alibag population due to the Project
will not result in unsatisfactory living conditions. The Government of
Maharashtra also plans to initiate immediately a study through the Bombay
Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (BMRDA) of the urban infra-
structural requirements of the area during the next five to seven years and
prepare an action program including an implementation schedule by June 30,
1980. The impact of the fertilizer project will also be studied by BMRDA and
taken into account in updating the regional development plans.  Other possible
environmental effects of the Project have also been reviewed by the Bank to
confirm that the Project will not adversely affect the region. Finally, the
construction of the Project will bring to the area within a short period a
large construction work force (about 5,000 people) and it is necessary to
ensure that they are housed properly to prevent slum conditions in the con-
struction camps. RCF has agreed to ensure that the construction camps will
be provided with protected water supply, adequate sanitary facilities and
clean surroundings. The pollution control and environmental measures adopted
for the project area are, thus, acceptable and will continue to be monitored
during project implementation.
VI. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTION
A.  Project Management
6.01      RCF, which will be responsible for implementing the Project, became
a separate legal entity in April 1978 (para 2.18). The Government has already
appointed Mr. Duleep Singh, who was until recently the General Manager of
FCI's Trombay Unit, as the Chairman and Managing Director of RCF, and the
Finance Director has been selected. The RCF management has also made
appointments to the senior positions in the Project (Annex 6) including
the key positions of General Manager and the Project Manager. The overall
coordination of the Project with the process engineering firms, Fertilizer
(Planning and Development) India Ltd. (FPDIL), and other contractors will
rest with the project authorities. RCF has appointed a person with extensive
experience in project implementation and plant operations, as the General
Manager in charge of the Project. He will be assisted by a Project Manager
having experience in coordinating and monitoring project construction using
project teams drawn from engineering and scheduling disciplines. This man-
agement team, supplemented with additional persons as required, will have
direct responsibility for project implementation. Satisfactory assurances



- 34 -
have been obtained from RCF that it will establish and maintain a Project
implementation Unit staffed with adequate personnel and headed by a suitably
qualified and experienced Project Manager.
6.02      The proposed project implementation staf'f organization is given in
Annex 6  .  The General Manager, who will be in charge at the project site,
will be assisted by a Project Manager, who will plan, coordinate and schedule
all site construction activity. Individual project management teams will be
responsible for different plant areas, such as ammonia, urea, steam genera-
tion, water treatment, material handling, etc. The Project Manager will also
be assisted by a project team which will be responsible for project studies,
revisions, schedule and cost monitoring and management reporting. The site
project organization will include an operations management team with a Training
Manager, who will develop and implement a training plan so that the team
complemented with trained operating and maintenance personnel, can take over
the operation of the facilities after commissioning, RCF has prepared a
draft Project Implementation Manual and has agreed to finalize the same for
Bank's review before November 30, 1979.
6.03      Even though India has developed considerable local capabilities in
design, engineering and project management of fertilizer plants (para 2.12),
it does not at present possess process know-how for ammonia and urea plants
of the size involved. RCF, therefore, is in the process of selecting two
foreign engineering firms, with direct experience in building similar capacity
plants, to provide the process know-how (para 7.05). Invitations for proposals
for the ammonia plant were issued in March 1978 to six internationally known
process engineering firms, and invitations for the urea plant were issued
in late 1978 (Reference E - Project File). RCF is finalizing its selection of
the ammonia engineering firm and expects to enter into a contract by August
1979 after consultation with the Bank. The contract is expected to become
effective by October 1979. The urea engineering proposals were opened in
January 1979 and the selection of the urea engine!ering firm is expected by
September 1979. The selected engineering firms will be fully responsible for
sound engineering,, timely completion of the plants, training of personnel in
similar plants, and process guarantees. They will utilize the services of the
FPDIL to the extent possible for detailed engineering, procurement, shop
inspection, etc. Plant civil works and construclion will be carried out by
experienced Indian contractors, who will be techlnically supervised by RCF
engineers and by engineers from the process engineering firms. The plants
will be tested and commissioned by RCF engineers and technicians with tech-
nical supervision of expatriate engineers.
B.   Engineering and Transfer of Technology
6.04      The arrangements proposed for implementing the Project are similar
to those used successfully in Bank-financed expansion projects at Nangal,
Sindri and Trombay. FPDIL has also carried out such work for other public
sector units and has the capacity to undertake the project assignment. Con-
tracting arrangements with the foreign process engineering firms would provide
for FPDIL involvement during all facets of project implementation. The con-
tracts will also permit reuse of the design and engineering by FPDIL in other
similar projects in India with reduced expatriate assistance; the proposed
Surat fertilizer complex is likely to be the first project to benefit from



- 35 -
this technology transfer arrangement. RCF will use competent Indian con-
sultancy firms who will be responsible for the design, engineering and imple-
mentation of the offsites and utilities. FPDIL is carrying out the soil
investigations and is expected to assist RCF in planning and design of the
township.
C.   Project Schedule
6.05      The first stream of ammonia and urea plants along with required
project offsites is expected to be mechanically completed by February 1983--42
months from the zero date of August, 1979, (as shown in the project schedule
on the following page). The second stream of ammonia and urea plants is
scheduled to be completed six months later in August 1983. 1/ Thus the entire
Project would be completed in 48 months from the date the ammonia engineering
firm is appointed (currently estimated to be August 1979), provided the ammonia
engineering firm starts designs by the end of August 1979 and the orders for
the steam generation units are placed before the end of September 1979. The
project is expected to be in commercial production by February 1984. Consider-
ing the importance of the start of ammonia plant design work to the project
schedule the appointment of the ammonia engineering firm will be a condition
of Bank loan effectiveness. Agreement has also been reached with RCF that
it will place order for the steam generation unit before September 30, 1979.
The schedule is tight considering the size of the Project and the green-field
site. However, considering the project preparation work already completed and
the provision of good project management, emphasizing effective coordination
with other agencies, it is considered achievable.
6.06      As several important equipment items for the ammonia plant and other
facilities have deliveries of 16 months or longer, it is essential that bid
documents be prepared before November 1979. To facilitate timely placing
of orders with maximum use of international competitive bidding, the proj-
ect authorities have already placed international advertisements for vendor
registration. It is expected that a satisfactory vendor list will be ready
for the Project by August 1979.
6.07      The Project relies on several other government agencies for timely
completion of schemes which will provide the Project with land, water, elec-
tricity, road and rail links; delays in one or more of them could delay
project completion. To coordinate progress of work by the various agencies,
the State Government has formed a Coordination Committee, headed by the
Secretary (Industries) of the Maharashtra Government and includes representa-
tives of RCF, MIDC, Maharashtra State Electricity Board, Bombay Metropolitan
Regional Development Authority, Maharashtra Prevention of Water Pollution
Board and the Central Railways. The Government of Maharashtra has assured
that the above committee will continue for the duration of the Project and
will provide all the required support to the above agencies to carry out
their respective obligations in a timely and efficient way.
I/   Project will be deemed completed when each of the facilities included
has been in operation satisfactorily for at least 60 consecutive days
at an average daily capacity utilization of not less than 80%.

VII. CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A.   Capital Costs
7.01      The total financing required for the Project, including working
capital and interest during construction, is estimated at US$812.3 million,
of which US$343.1 million is in foreign exchange. This includes the infra-
structure investments for the rail spur from Penn, township and advance
against cost of power connection from Apta, but excludes the costs of the gas
pipeline from Uran, the water supply scheme and road strengthening. The base
capital cost estimates are in October 1978 prices, as detailed in Annex 7-1
and summarized below:

and on cost data of recent equipment orders placed for the Sindri Modernization,
Trombay IV and Phulpur Projects (Project File-Reference A). The estimate was
also cross-checked by FPDIL with budgetary offers received from major inter-
national licensors and engineering firms for both the ammonia and the urea



- 38 -
plants. Physical contingencies are calculated at 10% on main plant equipment
and supplies, offsites, civil works and plant erection. The estimates include
annual price escalation of 7.5% for 1979 and 1980 and 7% thereafter for all
imported items and local equipment,and 9% for 1979 and 1980 and 8% thereafter
for local civil works and erection as well as other local cost items other
than equipment. The project cost estimates have 'been reviewed against cost
estimates indicated by the major plant contractors and are considered satis-
factory. They will be detailed further for project control purposes when the
engineering contracts for the ammonia and urea plants have been awarded.   The
working capital of US$74.4 million in current prices, is based on 45 days of
receivables, and 15 to 30 days of accounts payable. Interest during construc-
tion, at US$61.3 million, is derived from the total project cost, the four
years construction schedule, and the Government's on-lending rates to the
Project of 10.25%.

currency expenditures. The Government's equity contribution will come from
its development budget (US$227.9 million); duties and taxes on equipment
and materials (US$71.2 million); and interest during construction (US$27.1
million). The Government will also provide US$115.3 million of debt financing
(32% of required long-term debt financing) for both local and foreign currency
expenditure. The short-term financing of US$55.8 million will be available
either from RCF's internal resources or from commercial banks and forms 75%
of the working capital requirements. The Government has agreed to provide
adequate funds to RCF to complete its ongoing projects and to finance the
Project including any cost overruns and to meet any shortfalls in the avai-
lability of internal resources from RCF's operations or in short-term funds
expected from commercial banks.
7.04      The proposed Bank loan of US$250 million equivalent will cover 73%
of total foreign financing requirements of the Project. The Bank loan will
be lent to the Project through the Government relending the amount to RCF
under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with a repayment period of 15 years includ-
ing 5 years grace and a net interest rate of 10.25%. Agreement has been
reached with the Government that appropriate ratification of the Subsidiary
Loan Agreement will be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan. The
Government is discussing with the UK Government possible financing of about
L 45 million which it plans to use for financing part of the foreign exchange
financing gap (US$93.1 million). To the extent UK assistance is not available
and to bridge the rest of the gap, the Government will use its own free
foreign exchange reserves.
C.   Procurement and Disbursement
7.05      The design and engineering services for the ammonia and urea plants
will be obtained following the Bank's guidelines for the use of consultants.
Proposals have been invited internationally from qualified experienced engi-
neering firms, and contracts will be awarded after evaluation, which will
emphasize adequate experience and technical capabilities (para 6.03). Equip-
ment and materials within the battery limits of the ammonia and urea plants
will be financed with the Bank loan. International Competitive Bidding
(ICB) will be used for all Bank-financed goods and related services, except
for critical or proprietary imported items and small items costing less than
US$100,000 up to a combined maximum of US$25.0 million, which will be procured
by prudent international shopping, according to a list of goods to be agreed
with the Bank. For purpose of bid evaluation, local suppliers will receive
a margin of preference of 15% or the applicable customs duty, whichever is
lower. The remaining imported items are expected to be financed using British
(ODM) aid or free foreign exchange, using either U.K. (tied) procurement pro-
cedures or international bidding. The Government has agreed that any item
financed from non-Bank sources, for which the British or Indian delivery
schedules are unacceptable for timely project completion, will be procured
through international bidding. On this basis, the project authorities intend
to purchase the steam generation units and the turbo-generators either from
the United Kingdom using ODM funds or from other international sources, if the
UK deliveries do not meet the project schedule. The civil works and erection



- 40 -
(financed with local funds) will be carried out by Indian subcontractors who
will be selected following competitive bidding procedures normally adopted by
Indian public sector units; these are acceptable. The project management and
part of the engineesring services will be provided by the RCF and FPDIL staff.
The above arrangements made for procuring the supplies and services for the
Project are satisfactory.
7.06      The allocation of the proposed Bank loan of US$250 million will be
as below:

/a   Foreign = CIF; Local = ex-factory.
Of the total equipment and spares for the Project: estimated to cost US$375
million (including contingencies), it is expected that Indian manufacturers
will supply about US$120 million (or 32%) and the balance (US$255 million or
68%) will be imported. It is also estimated thal: the Bank loan will finance
local supplies totalling approximately US$80 million won by Indian suppliers
under ICB. It wiLl not finance the remaining local items (about US$40 mil-
lion) on which on:Ly local suppliers are expected to bid. It is, therefore,
anticipated that approximately 68% of the Bank loan will be disbursed against
foreign currency expenditures and the remainder against local currency expend-
itures. The Bank loan is expected to be disbursed by June 30, 1984, in accord-
ance with the disbursement schedule set forth in Annex 7-2.
VIII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Revenues and Operating Costs
8.01      The assumptions used in the financial analysis of the Project are
given in Annex 8-1. The analysis assumes that the first stream of the ammonia
and urea plants will start commercial production in August 1983 and the second
stream in February 1984. Capacity utilization of each stream is assumed at
60% in the first twelve months of operations, 80% in the second year and 90%
in the third and succeeding years. Average 90% capacity utilization from
the third year onward should be achievable, since the Project's feedstock,
natural gas, is relatively easy to process and considering that project scope,
design, and implementation and initial operating arrangements ensure that the



- 41 -
Project will not face technical difficulties which in the past have led to
reduced capacity utilization in some other Indian plants. At 90% capacity
utilization, the Project will produce 801,900 tpy of ammonia out of which
775,170 tpy will be converted to 1,336,500 tpy of urea and the remaining
26,730 tpy will be sold as anhydrous ammonia. The economic life of the
Project is assumed to be 12 operating years with assets depreciated on a
straight-line basis.
8.02      Urea prices for the financial analysis have been calculated on
the basis of the Government's new fertilizer pricing policy (para 2.16). In
1983/84 the initial ex-factory price for urea from the ProjSct is estimated
at Rs 2,511/ton, at an assumed gas price of Rs 878/1,000 Nm , both in current
terms (para 5.10).   The urea ex-factory price expressed in current terms in-
creases from Rs 2,611/ton in 1983/84 to Rs 3,004/ton in 1993/94. The pricing
formula is explained in detail in Annex 8-1 and the year-by-year price cal-
culations are shown in Annex 8-2. The (notional) freight for urea from a
fertilizer plant to its market included in the sale price of urea averaged
Rs 38/ton in 1977/78.   Since the Thal plant will initially market a substan-
tial part of its urea in Uttar Pradesh (para 4.14), its actual average freight
cost would be much higher at about Rs 124/ton in October 1978 terms. However,
as part of the new pricing system the Government operates a freight equaliza-
tion pool arrangement, which reimburses the producers the difference between
the notional and the actual freight expense.
8.03      The quantity of saleable ammonia available from the Project is
quite small and will mainly substitute for ammonia imported through Trombay.
The Government has recently extended the fertilizer pricing arrangement to
ammonia sold to other fertilizer units for conversion to fertilizers. Based
on the present government pricing formula, the ex-factory price of ammonia
has been assumed to be lower than the ex-factory retention price of urea by
US$11.6 (Rs 100 per ton in 1978/79 terms), which is the cost of bagging.
8.04      The production costs of ammonia and urea are given in Annex 8-3
and are summarized below:

- 42 -
The raw materials, utilities, depreciation and inlsurance and taxes together
form about 77% of the cost of production of urea. The project cost, capacity
utilization and the gas price will, therefore, be the major factors affecting
the production cost of urea.
B.   Financial Projections

8.06      The sales revenues are expected to increase from Rs 778 million
in 1983/84 to Rs :3,563 million in 1986/87 when the capacity utilization is
to reach 90%, whi:Le net after tax profits increase from Rs 100 million to
Rs 1,048 million. Indian tax legislation would enable RCF to postpone any
tax liability on the project unit until after 1991/92. Even though taxes will
not be assessed on the Project directly, notional taxes are presented here to
show the tax liability due to the Project on RCF s overall corporate taxation.



- 43 -
The Project is expected to generate, immediately after commissioning, enough
cash to meet all its obligations. Its 1985/86 debt service coverage of 2.7,
current ratio of 6.7 and debt to equity ratio of 34/66 are considered satis-
factory. These ratios improve throughout the project life. In the fourth
and subsequent years of operation, the Project should be able to pay a yearly
dividend of 10% of the share capital.
C. Financial Rate of Return and Break-Even Point
8.07      The base case financial rate of return (before tax) of the Project in
constant 1978 Rupees is calculated at 8.9%. This low financial rate of return,
compared to the economic return of 19.9% (para 9.06), is basically due to the
retention price formula which only allows the urea ex-factory price to increase
an average 1.5% per year in current terms. With the deflator of 7% per year
used to convert the price to constant terms, the urea price, in fact, declines
by an average of 5.1% per year. The provision of the higher of the 12% after
tax or 28.4% pretax return on net worth (at 80% capacity utilization) under
the pricing formula combined with the long tax holiday available to key in-
dustries strongly motivates producers to improve capacity utilization and to
reinvest their earnings in fixed assets.   In spite of this modest financial
rate of return the Project, as noted above, has good financial ratios from
the initial years of operation. As mentioned, the Government has agreed not
to take any action which, assuming production under conditions of efficient
operation, would prevent fertilizer manufacturers from meeting their expenses,
servicing their debts, and earning a reasonable return on invested capital.
8.08      Sensitivity tests have been conducted to determine the effects
of various events on the financial rate of return. The return is not very
sensitive to changes in capital and operating costs due to the compensating
effect of the urea retention price formula which allows higher prices with
increases in costs. Therefore, the sensitivity of the return and the urea
retention price to changes in project parameters has also been analyzed. The
cash flows used for this purpose are shown in Annex 8-1 and the results are
summarized below:

Financial rates of return of fertilizer projects are generally most sensitive
to changes in the fertilizer prices. However, as mentioned the new urea
pricing formula assures the Project a 28.4% before-tax return on net worth at
80% capacity utilization. The Project is most sensitive to a decline in
capacity utilization and less sensitive to other factors such as operating and
capital cost changes. The Project is also quite sensitive to an implementa-
tion delay.  The increase in capital costs due to a delay would be mostly
covered by the compensating effect of the increased urea retention price, but
the time slippage still has its negative effect on the financial rate of
return., In general, most of the adverse effects are to a great extent compen-
sated by changes in the retention price, except for a drop in the capacity
utilization. Since the Project is going to be (i) based on commercially
proven technology (ii) implemented and operated by RCF's personnel with
experience in this field and (iii) assured of a large enough market for the
plant's products, the Project should encounter no major financial problem.
8.09      Using the urea retention price formula (para. 8.02) the profit and
cash break-even points in terms of capacity utilization in 1986/87 are 50%
and 41%, respectively.

8.11      The assumptions used for these projections are similar to those
used for the financial projections of the Project (Annex 8-1). The consoli-
dated projections show that between 1983/84-1986/87, when the Project reaches
its normal production level, sales revenue will increase by 93%, while gross
profit before taxes will increase by 124%. The large increase in profit is
due to the higher ex-factory prices available for urea from the new Trombay V
and Thal Projects. Up to 1983/84, the projected increase in sales volume will
be mainly due to the coming on stream and production build-up of Trombay IV
and Trombay V Projects. Net operating income increases from Rs 310 million
in 1983/84 to Rs 925 million in 1989/90. Almost 90% of RCF's net operating
income during the period 1985/86 and 1989/90 will be due to the Project. All
the financial ratios of the consolidated financial statements are satisfactory.
E.   Financial Covenants
8.12      Satisfactory agreements have been reached with RCF that it will
(a) maintain for itself and for the Project, during the life of the loan, a
debt/equity ratio of 50/50 or better; (b) maintain a current ratio of at least
1.2; (c) not borrow additional funds if as a result its projected debt service
coverage will fall below 1.4; (d) not take any action, such as distribution of
funds, dividends or entry into any other financial commitments, or prepayment
of debt, that would reduce its current ratio below 1.5; and (e) submit timely
periodic progress reports on the Project and its annual audited reports within
4 months of the ending of its fiscal year, in a form satisfactory to the
Bank.
F.   Major Risks
8.13      The Project faces four major potential risks.  First, since it is a
grass-roots plant in a rural area, delays or problems in the implementation
of the Project proper or the infrastructure could seriously affect the Project.
This risk is reduced considering that (i) the project site has been acquired,
and access to the land is available; (ii) a railroad spur from Apta to Penn is
already under construction and preparatory work on the siding from the Penn
railhead to the plant site has been completed by the Indian Railways; (iii)
ONGC has already carried out the route survey for the gas pipeline from the
Uran terminal to the project site; (iv) MSEB has started work on the construc-
tion of the power line from Apta substation to the site and (v) MIDC has made
preliminary financial arrangements for the water supply system. This risk
will be further reduced, as progress of the infrastructure work will continue
to be monitored and coordinated by the Coordination Committee constituted by
the Maharashtra Government and all the required support will be provided by
the State Government to the above agencies to carry out their respective
obligations in a timely and efficient way (para 5.14).
8.14      The second risk is a possible delay in the start-up of the Project
due to technical problems in the engineering, construction, erection and
commissioning of this largest fertilizer complex yet to be built in India.
This risk is reduced due to the fact that the Project will use commercially



- 46 -
proven technologies supplied by internationally recognized engineering firms
and because RCF's staff, which has adequate experience in building and
starting-up similar, although somewhat smaller plants, will implement this
Project utilizing FPDIL where required. RCF has agreed to obtain, if necessary,
foreign operating and maintenance assistance during the initial year of oper-
ation from the ammonia engineering firm. A cost overrun is the third main
risk of the Project. This could be caused by a start-up delay, by problems
in the construction and transportation of the large pieces of equipment needed
for a plant of thi's size or by a cost overrun in the civil works and erection
of the plant. This risk is reduced due to RCF's previous experience in
constructing fertilizer plants and by the location of the plant near the
ocean where the large pieces of equipment can be unloaded onto a ramp and then
easily be transported to the plant site. RCF has agreed to prepare a Project
Implementation Manual defining adequately the man1ner in which the Project will
be implemented, and discuss the manual with the Bank.
8.15      Finally, even though the land for the Project has been acquired and
the Project is considered environmentally acceptable by the Government and
the Bank, its location at Thal has faced some civic group opposition in Bombay
City. However, considering that RCF has now completed acquisition, taken
possession of the land and has started site work, that the local community
welcomes the Project and that both the Maharashtra and Central Governments
fully support the Thal location, the risks of further delays are limited.
IX. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Economic Costs and Benefits
9.01      The assumptions used in the economic analysis of the Project are
given in Annex 9-1. All economic costs and benefits for tradeable items have
been determined by using the Bank's projections of long-term international
prices estimated to prevail in the 1980s. For non-tradeable items, domestic
prices have been taken and, where applicable, adjusted to reflect the economic
price of their internationally traded components.
9.02      The economic capital cost of the Project was obtained from the
escalated phased financial capital cost expenditures after deflation to 1978
prices using currency deflation factors and after deduction of import duties
and local taxes on equipment and other items. The Project, being a grass-
roots project, includes in its capital costs part of the infrastructure,
including the township (US$8.5 million), the railroad spur from Penn to the
project site (US$12.6 million) and the power line from Apta (US$2.4 million).
The infrastructure facilities financed by other agencies include water supply
(MIDC) and gas pipeline (ONGC). Since the gas and water prices include the
full cost of their delivery to the project site, no further adjustments for
arriving at the economic capital costs were considered necessary.



- 47 -
9.03      For calculating economic benefits the future price of bagged urea
f.o.b. Europe is assumed to increase from its present price of US$145-155/ton
to US$165/ton (1978 constant prices) by 1983/84 when the Project will be
commissioned, and to US$180 per ton in 1984/85. The analysis assumes that the
urea price (in October 1978 constant prices) will not increase further during
the operating life of the Project. With the international freight to India
estimated at around US$30/ton and unloading, port handling and storage charges
at around US$5/ton, the c.i.f. landed price (excluding any import duty) of
bagged urea in India is calculated at US$215/ton in 1978 dollars. The f.o.b.
price of ammonia in 1983/84 is expected to be about US$160/ton and with marine
freight to India of US$35/ton and unloading charges of US$5/ton, the economic
price of ammonia is assumed at US$200/ton (in 1978 dollars).
9.04      The economic price of the associated gas is assumed to be the cost
of substituting fuel oil for steam generation in boilers and has thus been
related to the fuel oil price based on its calorific value. On the basis of
the projected fuel oil price in 1978 dolla s of US$85/ton, the price of the
natural gas is assumed at US$73.4/1,000 Nm , i.e., US$2.20/MSCF in 1978
dollars. The economic price of natural gas would increase with any fuel
oil price increases (in real terms) in the world markets. The sensitivity of
the economic rate of return to the gas price is included in the sensitivity
analysis. All other tradeable and non-tradeable items are valued at their
respective domestic prices, less local taxes and duties.
B. Economic Rate of Return
9.05      The base case economic rate of return has been calculated at 19.9%.
The cash flows for the economic rate of return are given in Annex 9-2 and the
sensitivity analysis summarized below.
Economic Rate of Return - Sensitivity Analysis
Case                         Percentage
Base Case                                                19.9
Capital Costs up 10%                                     18.3
Operating Costs up 10%                                   18.7
Capacity Utilization down by 10%                         17.8
Delay of Completion (1 Year)                             17.2
Economic Product Prices down 10%                         16.7
Economic Product Prices up 10%              3            22.7
Gas Price Increases 50% to US$11041,000 Nm               16.6
Gas Price Drops to US$49/1,000 Nm                        21.8
A 10% drop in revenues would reduce the return to 16.7% and a one year delay
in project implementation, combined with a 10% capital cost overrun and
the ultimate attainment of only 80% capacity utilization (as against 90%
assumed), would reduce the economic 5eturn to 15.3%. If the price of gas
increases by 1984 to US$110/1,000 Nm in 1978 dollars without any change in



- 48 -
the urea price, the economic return would drop to 16.6%. However, this
sensitivity to economic cost of gas should be viewed with caution since any
increases in international hydrocarbon prices would also most likely increase
the fertilizer prices above the level assessed in. this report. Therefore,
even under conceivable adverse conditions, the Project yields a satisfactory
economic rate of return. A rough assesment of the probabilities of uncer-
tainties associated with the economic costs and benefits of the Project and
of the risks associated with the Project (paras 8.13-8.15) indicates that
the expected economic return would be close to the base case economic rate
of return of about 20%.
9.06      The difference between the financial and the economic rates of
return (para. 8.08) is mainly due to the difference between the financial
price for urea, calculated according to the retention price formula, and the
forecast international urea price. In constant 1978 dollars, the urea reten-
tion price drops from US$200/ton in 1984/85 to US$127/ton in 1993/94, while
the international urea price is assumed to remain at US$215/ton c.i.f.
C. Other Benefits
9.07      The major benefits from the Project will be a more assured supply
of fertilizers to the farmer and the foreign exchange savings due to reduced
fertilizer imports. Annual urea and ammonia sale!s from the Project (at 90%
capacity utilization) will be about 1.34 million tpy and 0.03 million tpy,
respectively. The! net annual foreign exchange saving in 1978 dollars, after
deducting the foreign exchange component of operating costs but before service
of foreign debt, will be about Rs 1,720 million (US$200 million). Thus the
Project's estimated foreign exchange requirement would be covered by savings
in about 1.7 years of full operations.
9.08      Direct employment created by the Project would be about 1,500 jobs.
At the peak periocd of construction activity, more than 5,000 people will be
employed, largely from the surrounding areas. When the Project goes into
operation, it is expected to support through secondary and tertiary employment
another 5,000 jobs or more. Kolaba is one of the backward regions of the
Maharashtra State and at present has no major economic activities other than
agriculture and fisheries in the area. Installat:ion of a large fertilizer
complex in the area will help attract several small and medium scale service
industries needed to provide maintenance and other services for the complex.
X. AGREEMENTS
10.01     The fol:Lowing major assurances and agreements have been obtained
from the Government and RCF:



- 49 -
A.   From the Government that it will:

izer manufacturers from meeting all their expenses,
servicing their debts and earning a reasonable return
on invested capital (para 4.25);
(iv)  assure adequate supplies of natural gas, and coal for
the Project (paras 5.10 and 5.11);
(v)  provide adequate funds, including foreign exchange, to RCF

priate safety norms and ecological and environmental
standards (paras 5.17-5.20);
(iv)  employ, before December 31, 1979, a competent independent
consultant firm to design the pollution control measures
for the Project and present the designs for review by the
Bank before June 30, 1980, and subsequently implement them
(para 5.17);



- 50 -
(v) continue to employ as long as necessary a Rehabilitation
Officer to assist the families affected by the Project in
their relocation (para 5.19);
(vi) establish and maintain a Project Implementation Unit staffed
with adequate personnel and headed by a suitably qualified
and experienced Project Manager and prepare and furnish to
the Bank for its review by November 30, 1979, a Project

RCF (para 7.04), the appointment of the ammonia engineering firm (para 6.05),
and the finalization of satisfactory agreements for the adequate supplies of
gas, coal, power .and water (paras 5.10, 5.11, 5.12 and 5.13) would be condi-
tions of effectivieness of the Bank loan.
10.03     Based on the above agreements and assurances, the Project provides
a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$250 million equivalent to the Govern-
ment for a period of 20 years including five years of grace, at 7.9% per annum
interest rate, to be onlent to the Company (RCF) on terms spelled out in para
7.04.

INDIA-THAL FERTILIZER PROJECT
Capacity Utilization of Nitrogenous
Fertilizer Plants in Operation
1.        A detailed analysis of unitwise capacity utilizaLion of nitrogenous
fertilizer plants during the period 1971/79 is given in the attached table.
2.        This analysis indicates that the low average capacity utilization
cannot be expai'ned entirely in a public versus private sector ownership
framework since, in addition to management, other key determining factors
are plant design and age, size of plant, power availability and feedstock.
A review of un-twise 1/ capacity utilization reveals that the overall low
capacity utilization of the public sector is mainly due to five plants,
Sindri, Udyogamandal, Rourkela,  Neyveli, Cochin and Durgapur which still
do not perform satisfactorily due to various constraints discussed below.
In contrast, for example, Nangal's good performance in 1975/76 and 1976/77
as compared to the low capacity utilization in the preceding years was
due to better availability of power. Its future production will be protected
from power shortages with the IDA-financed Nangal Expansion Project (Credit
357--IN), already commissioned.
3.        Sindri's plants which were commissioned in the 1950s have suffered
from the poor quality of Rajasthan gypsum and difficulties in developing
and obtaining coal blends suited for good qua:Lity coke and coke oven gas
production. These plants which operated at 73% to 81% of their capacity
during 1970/71 to 1974/75, have deteriorated :in the last four years due
to aging equipment. The IDA-financed Sindri Modernization Project
(Credit 520-IN), as mentioned currently under commissioning, will provide
the existing finished fertilizer plants with ammonia from a new 900 tpd
fuel oil-based plant. Udyogamandal plants, commissioned between 1947/48
and 1967/68, operated at between 38% and 49% of their capacities until
1975/76. Modifications to improve their performance increased utilization
to 62% in 1978/79. The Rourkela plant, based on coke oven gas and nitrogen
from the Rourkela steel plant, also operated at only 20%of its capacity in
1970/71, due to inadequate coke oven gas availability. Even though a naphtha
reformer was commissioned in 1970/71 to supplement the gas availability,
further deterioration in coke oven gas availability kept down utilization
to about 40%, through 1973/74. In the next two years steps were taken to
increase production by using fuel oil to replace coke oven gas, wherever
possible, in steelmaking. As a result, Rourkela's fertilizer production
increased to 67% of its capacity in 1966/67 but declined to 57% in 1978/79.
Under the IDA-financed Fertilizer Industry Credit (Credit 598-IN), an
additional naphtha reforming furnace is scheduled to be commissioned at
Rourkela in 1979/80, to help improve capacity utilization.
4.        Neyveli had faced difficulties in the operation of the Winkler
gasifiers with its lignite, so that during the first five years ending in
1975/76, production ranged at only between 21% to 39.1% of capacity. After
1/  Excluding units commissioned in 1977/78 and 1978/79 and still being
stabilized.

revamping of the gasifiers and with plant modifications, the production
reached 59% of capacity in 1977/78 and 54% in 1978/79. Fuel oil gasifiers,
now being installed at Neyveli as part of the Fertilizer Industry Credit, are
expected to be commissioned in 1980 and should improve capacity utilization
further. Finally, poor performance at Cochin and Durgapur is mainly due to
design defects; these were the first two plants engineered in India with
process licenses from several foreign process licensors. Design defects and
equipment failures delayed commissioning of the plants and their stabilized
operation. The Durgapur plant has also been affected by the poor quality
of power supply from the state grid. Even with modifications carried out
so far, the Durgapur and Cochin plants operated in 1978/79 only at 25% and
53%, respectively, of their installed capacities. Further plant modifications
are now being made based on a Tecnimont (Italy) end-to-end survey. An in-
plant puwer generation unit to be installed at Durgapur will improve the
quality of power supply to critical units.
5.        Of the unscheduled production losses of about 350,000 tpy of nitro-
gen in the last three years, equipment failures in aged plants and in recently
commissioned new plants accounted for about 70% and power problems for another
20%. Problems affecting the performance of the public sector fertilizer
plants were studied by a Government Committee in 1978 and several measures
recommended. Many of the recommendations, including those for better planning
of preventive maintenance to minimize such unscheduled losses, have been
adopted.
6.        As described above, since 1969/70 the Government has taken several
measures to improve fertilizer production. The Bank has also assisted with a
credit of US$17 million as part of the Trombay IV Project (Credit 481-IN)
to revamp the Durgapur and Cochin plants. In additon to the two credits
already mentioned to increase production at Nangal and Sindri, the Fertilizer
Industry Credit of US$105 million, approved in 1975, was specifically
designed to improve capacity utilization of the Indian fertilizer industry.
The Credit covered a large number of projects involving eleven plants including
(a)changeover to fuel oil feedstock at Neyveli, (b) a naphtha reformer at
Rourekela, (c) captive power plants at Durgapur, Gorakhpur, Trombay and
Visthapatnam to meet the critical plant loads and reduce production losses
due to power fluctuations, (d) purge gas recovery units planned at Baroda,
Goa, Kalol and Vizag to increase ammonia production, and (e) debottlenecking
of the phosphoric acid plant at Baroda.

INDIA - THAL FERTILIZER PROJECT
Pollution Control Norms and Conditions Prescribed by the
Maharashtra Prevention of Water Pollution Board
I.   LIQUID EFFLUENTS
1.   The daily quantity of domestic effluent from the factory shall
not exceed 0.2 Mgd.
2.   The daily quantity of industrial effluent shall not exceed 8.0 Mgd.
3.   Separate system shall be provided for collecting industrial and
domestic effluents. Terminal manholes shall be provided separately
for the industrial and domestic effluent (at: the end of collection
system) with arrangements for measuring the flow. No effluent
shall be adm-itted in the sewers downstream of the terminal manholes.
No liquid effluent shall find its way other than in the designed and
provided collection system for the domestic as well as industrial
effluents. Separate storm water sewerage system shall be provided.
A.  Domestic eff-Leunt:
4.   Treatment:  Since the domestic effluent from the factory is to be
treated along with industrial effluent, no separate parameters are
specified for domestic effluent.
B.   Industrial effluent:
5.   Treatment:  The level of treatment would depend upon the disposal fa-
cilities available. The Company authorities have indicated that suffi-
cient land is available for disposal of treated effluent on land. The
effluent after treatment shall comply with the following standards:
1.   PH                              Between 5.5 and 9
2.   Suspended Solids                Not to exceed       50 mg/l
3.   B.O.D. 5 days 200C                      -do-        50 mg/l
4.   Sulphates                               -do-      1000 mg/l
5.   Dissolved Solids                        -do-      2100 mg/l
6.   Chlorides                               -do-       600 mg/l
7.   Percent Sodium                          -do-       60%
8.   Total Ammonical Nitrogen                -do-       50  mg/l
6.        During the episodal discharges and monsoon period when the effluent
is not required for irrigation, it shall be treated and then discharged into
the sea. For discharging into the sea it shall be so treated that the final
effluent shall satisfy the following standards:

ANNEX 5-2
Page 2
1.   PH                              Between 5.5 and 7
2.   Temperature                     Not to exceed by 3  above
the receiving water temperature
3.   Total Suspended Solids          Not to exceed       50 mg/l
4.   Total Ammonical Nitrogen                -do-        50 mg/l
5.   B.O.D. 5 days 200C                      -do-        50 mg/l
6.   C.O.D.                                  -do-        50 mg/l
7.   D.O.                            Not less than        5 mg/l
8.   Oil and grease                  Not to exceed       10 mg/l
9.   Bio-assay test on fish shall show 90% survival in 96 hours.
7.        RCF shall take appropriate measures by way of soil conditioning
and/or spread polythene sheets to avoid pollution by percolation of effluent
required to be stored in the pond.
8.        As regard to arrangements for disposal into the sea through pipeline,
the same will have to be taken deep. The point of discharge shall be not less
than 4 meters.** A suitable point of discharge shall be selected after
carrying out investigations to see that there is proper disposal and diffusion
of the pollutants and that there is no building up of pollutants so that the
marine and fish life is not affected. Special care should be taken to see
that there is no building up of ammonia concentration leading to formation of
algae resulting in reduction in fish life. Adequate precaution would be taken
to see that the silting does not increase and move towards the Bombay harbour
creating operating problems to navigation. In this connection, the National
Institute of Oceanography may be consulted to carry out such investigations.
9.        The effluent treatment plant and the arrangement for the disposal
of the effluent either on land or into the sea as the case may be, shall be
completed and commissioned simultaneously with the manufacturing plant so that
no untreated effluent will at any time be discharged into the sea or applied
on land.
10.       RCF shall provide continuous PR monitoring system for water effluent
with audio alarm system and control.
II. AIR POLLUTION:
11.       The RCF shall take action to develop system of monitoring stack
omissions on the lines given below:
(a) Round the clock monitoring of all stacks for particulate matter,
So25 Oxides of Nitrogen and ammonia shall be done, samples being taken
for 10 minutes every 2 hours for gaseous pollutants and for 30 minutes every
two hours for particulate matter.
**   Also a proper diffuser arrangement shall be provided.

(b) RCF shall establish one year before commissioning of manufac-
turing plant, minimum of 3 ambient air quality st:ations in three directions
just outside the factory premises to assess the wind velocity and wind direc-
tion and for monit:oring the present and future particulate matter (including
critical analysis;) SO , NO and ammonia, samples being taken continuously for
24 hours. Analysis oi gases measured every 24 hours. Monitoring stations
shall be operated and maintained by RCF and resuLts produced to State Govern-
ment authorities/MPWP Board. The temperature inversion studies shall also be
carried out for one year from the date of issue of No Objection Certificate
with specific objectives of assessing the disposal of air pollutants omitted
from stack of 150 meters.
(c)  RCF shall permit inspection of their stack monitoring system and
equipment as well as their ambient air quality stations by the MPWP Board.
(d) The limits of stack omissions of RCF from all sources shall
not exceed 8 tpy in case of particulate matter and 18 tpy in case of SO2'
(e)  RCF shall adhere to average hourly stack emission limits of
air pollutants mentioned in (i) namely 0.35 t/hr. of particulate matter
and 0.75 t/hr. in case of SO2 so that if at any time the limits are
exceeded, they shall be brought down within limits within one hour either
by closure of plant or reduction of production.
(f)  RCF shall install alkali scrubbers for removal of SO2 if
the concentrating of SO in the ambient air is found to be 60 kg/m 3
2
annual average on 24 hours basis. RCF shall install control equipment having
an efficiency of 99% for removal of particulate matter with multicyclones and
LSP.
(g) Smoke density meter and automatic recorder shall be provided
on all the boiler stacks.
(h)  Stacks of not less than 150 meters height shall be constructed
for better disposal of pollutants.
12.       RCF shall give commitment to restrict the emissions stackwise to
the levels of emissions indicated above. In case any stack emission goes
above those levels, the RCF would have to shut clown the concerned unit or
underrate production. Also when episodal pollution is anticipated or occurs
similar action shall be taken. In addition, if the pollutants concentration
in ambient air increases above the permissible Levels for Thal-Vaishet area
further necessary measures will have to be taken to bring down the level of
pollution.

13.       Clearances of MPWP Board or its special committee appointed for
this purpose shall be obtained at every stage i.e., design, specifications,
installations, performance test of the air and water pollution control
equipment, etc.
14.       RCF shall maintain a green belt round the factory having a minimum
width of 100 m.
15.       The RCF shail abide by any directions given by the State Govern-
ment on a report of MPWP Board and/or any such authority as may De appointed
by State Government in case of violation of any of the above conditions.
16.       The firm shall observe good house keeping in the plant.
17.       The firm shall not cause nuisance to the surrounding areas
arising from bad smell, gaseous emissions, noise and fouling of water
resources nearby.
18.       The factory management shall give prior intimation of at
least 30 days to this Board about the commissioning of the factory so
that the arrangements provided for treatment and disposal of solid and
liquid and gaseous wastes can be inspected and final clearance can be
given for commissioning the factory.

ANNEX 8-1

INDIA - THAL FERTILIZER PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
OF THE PROJECT
1.        In the preparation of the financial projections for the Project,
(Annexes 8-4, 8-5 and 8-6), the following assumptions were made: a) all
revenues and costs were escalated from 1978 through 1993 in current prices;
b) financial projections were calculated for 10 years of operations; c) an
inflation rate of 7 percent per annum has been used on all the cash cost items
during the plant operation period.
A.   Capacity and Capacity Utilization
2.        It is assumed that the first stream of ammonia and urea plants will
start commercial operation by August 1983 and the second stream plants will
be in commercial operation by February 1984. The commercial operations are
assumed following six months of testing and commissioning after the plant's
mechanical completion. Projected losses during the above six months have been
capitalized. Each stream of the plants is assumed to operate at 60% during
the first year, 80% the second year and 90% thereon to: a 90% capacity
utilization corresponds to 1,336,500 tpy of urea and 26,730 tpy of ammonia
for sale.
B.   Revenues
3.        All revenues are at the ex-factory level and do not include the
Government levy, excise duty, dealers margin, or any other charges that
determine the spread between the ex-factory and the retail price. The present
retail selling price of urea is Rs 1450/ton of bagged urea. From this, the
current average ex-factory price of bagged urea can be derived as follows:
Retail Price                        Rs 1450
Less:  Fertilizer Pool Equali-
zation          Rs   52
Notional Freight            Rs   38
Excise Duty                 Rs   87
Dealer's Margin             Rs  115
Ex-factory Price                Rs    1158
In November 1977, the Government introduced a new national pricing policy
for the main nitrogenous fertilizer which will provide a reasonable return
on investment for the fertilizer industry. The scheme was extended to phos-
phatic fertilizer in February 1979. The new pri.cing policy calls for
ex-factory retention prices that allow each operating unit a 28.4% before-tax
return equivalent to a 12% after-tax return, on net worth at 80% capacity



-77-
ANNEX 8-1
Page 2
utilization. The relation between the before- and after-tax return is the
applicable income tax of 57.75% on taxable corporate income. The 28.4%
pre-tax return provided in the pricing formula permits a company to retain the
full benefits of any tax incentives it can receive. The urea retention price
is calculated using the following procedure (formula):
i)   Net fixed assets used in the production of urea
(97.78% of the total net fixed assets)
ii) + Working capital estimated at 4 months cash costs
of production related to urea at 80% capacity
iii) = Total capital employed
iv) - Outstanding borrowings associated with urea
production estimated at same percentage of the
total capital employed as that reflected in the
company balance sheets
v) = Total Net Worth used in the production of urea
vi)   28.4% return on the Total Net Worth
vii) + Interest on borrowings associated with urea pro-
duction at 10.25% for long-term borrowings and
13% for short-term borrowings
viii) + Variable and Fixed Costs related to urea produc-
tion with depreciation as provided in the fixed
asset tables of the company balance sheet
ix)   Sum = ex-factory realization to producer
x) -: Production volume of urea at 80% capacity utiliza-
tion (1,188,000 tpy)
xi)   Urea retention price
The retention price calculation basis is established every three years to
take into account the changes in net worth and debt service, but changes in
variable and fixed costs are allowed for as and when they occur, especially
for costs of major inputs. The retention price calculations for the Project
are given in Annex 8-2. This retention price formula provides the Company a
large cash flow during the initial years of operation, mainly due to the added
benefit of the tax exemptions and thus creates an incentive for reinvestment.
If no reinvestment occurs, the decreasing net worth with decreasing net fixed
assets reduces the return and thereby also the retention price (and conse-
quently revenues). The Government has under consideration a proposal to



-78-
ANNEX 8-1
Page 3
ensure that the net worth remains at or above the share capital of the fa-
cilities. In the case of the Thal Project, the retention price increases at
about 1.5 percent: per year in current prices, since the price escalation of
the production costs are larger than the decline in the return on net worth.
4.        The Government now allows each company to charge the actual aver-
age freight per ton of bagged urea in the retail price build-up, which in
the case of Thal would be about Rs 124/ton as compared to the notional
freight provision of Rs 38/ton. The difference between this ex-factory
price and the retention price will be paid by the Government to RCF.
5.        The Government has recently decided to extend the fertilizer pricing
formula to ammonia sold for conversion to ferti:Lizers. However, since the
available ammonia for sale is only about 3.3% of the total ammonia production,
for sake of simpLicity, its ex-factory sale price has been assumed to be the
same as the ex-factory sale price of unbagged urea.
C.   Operating Costs
6.        Associated Gas;  The Government has announced the basis for the
pricing of natural gas supplied for fertilizer production. To maintain finan-
cial parity with the naphtha-based fertilizer plants in India the natural gas
will be priced on the basis of the delivered cost of naphtha at the same loca-
tion adjusted for the relative calorific vilues of the two energy sources. On
this basis the gas price will be Rs 626/Nm price escalated at 7% p.a.
7.       _QaA:  The 1978/79 assumed CIF coal price is Rs 148/ton.  Since the main
factor in the coal price is labor, and its cost is assuimied to increase at
7% p.a., the coal price is escalated at that same rate.
8.        Other variable costs:  The 1978/79 prices for the other variable costs
are as follows:
Item                         1978/79 Assumed Price
3
Water                              Rs 0.70/M
Purchased Power                    Rs 240/MWH
Duty on Generated Power            Rs 20/MWH
Bags                               Rs  5/Bag
9.        Depreciation:  For the financial projections and for the retention
price calculation a 12 year straight line depreciation is used.

10.       Other income:  Considering that a) the high penalty the retention
price formula creates if no reinvestment occurs, b) no definite assumption can
be made as to the reinvestment opportunities available to the fully Government-
owned RCF, and c) the financial projections should give a fair picture of
the Project; it has been conservatively assumed that the yearly accumulated
surplus cash will be reinvested in government bonds yielding a 5% after tax
return.

S. No.
1         Initia;L capital outlay is project financing (Rs 6985 million) less
working capital (Rs 640 million), spares (Rs 265 million including
contingency and escalation) and half the cost of railway siding and
power connection (Rs 64 million)depos:Lted as advance. Depreciation
of Rs 490 million per year is based on 12 year straight line
depreciation for fixed assets excluding spares, land and township
(over 40 years).
2         Working capital estimated at 4 months cash cost of operations at
80% production level.
3         Capital employed is sum of (1) and (2).
4,5,6     Borrowings of the Thal unit for its cDnstruction and operation.
7         Estimated from capital employed (3) using the debt/share capital
ratio of the company balance sheet.
8         Net worth is capital employed (3) less notional loan (7).
9         Average net worth for the three year period is calculated by
obtaining the average of the net worth at the beginning and end
of each year and then the average for the three consecutive year
period. 98.7% of the net worth is allocated to urea production
and the rest to the surplus ammonia production.
10        28.4% of net worth allocated to urea (9).
11        Variable cost estimated at 80% level of operation for urea
production only - excluding surplus ammonia.
12        Selling expenses estimated for 80% level of urea production.
14        Part of the total annual depreciation of Rs 490 million (1)
allocated to urea production.
15,16     Part of the Thal unit's interest paymnents pro-rated for
notional loan (7).
17        Sum of (11), (12), (13), (14), (15) and (16).
18.       Calculated per ton of urea based on annual production at 80% of capacity
