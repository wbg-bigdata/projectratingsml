TERRIrORY CF PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA
ELECTRICITY CO4IWSSION OF PAFUA AND NEW GUINEA
APPRAISAL OF THE FIRST PHASE CF THE UPPER RAJU1U HYDROELECTRIC DEVELOPMENT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSICNS
i.        This report appraises the first phase of the Upper Ramu No. 1
hydroelectric scheme in New Guinea, needed to meet a growing demand for
power. Installed capacity will be 45 nil in three units. The project
will be constructed by the Electricity Comission of Papua and New Guinea
(ELCOM) between 1971 and l975. About 300 miles of transmission lines will
be built as part of the project linking the power station to several ex-
isting local networks which would be unified. The new underground power
station, operated as a run-of-the-river plant, will be the main source of
power for this system. The second phase of Upper Ramu No. 1 envisages
construction of a dam to regulate run-off and the installation of two more
15 MI units. A further development of 180 1NJ (Upper Ramu No. 2) is also
possible and would also benefit from the storage already provided. The
total cost of the project (i.e. Upper Ramu No. 1, phase 1) is estimated to
be US$3309 million equivalent. Costs to be incurred outside the Territory
of Papua and New Guinea are estimated to be US$23.2 million equivalent.
ii.       A Bank loan of US$23.2 million equivalent to meet the off-shore
costs has been requested by the Commonwealth of Australia (Guarantor),
on behalf of the Territory of Papua and Newi Guinea (Borrower) which the
Commonwealth administers. This loan would be the first to the Territory
for power0
iii.      ELCOM, which would be the beneficiary of the loan, was established
in 1963 as a statutory corporation and has adequate powers to conduct its
affairs in accordance with sound public utility practice. On matters of
policy, however, it must follow directions given by the Commonwealth Ymn-
ister of External Territories or the Territory Administration. The Ter-
ritory is moving rapidly towards self-government, when ELCOM would be
directly responsible to the new Government.
iv.       The Territoryts economy is based essentially on primary pro.-
duction and is showing healthy growth, particularly in the monetized
sector, with corresponding growth in the demand for power. In 1968/69,
GNP was US$217 per capita; energy generation was 83 kWh per capita (based
on a population of 2.4 million), which is consistent with the level of
development.  The monetized sector of the economy has been growing by 12%
annually since 1965/66 and accounts for 60% of the GNPo  Industrial output
has grown at 15% per annum over the same period, accounting for 16% of
GNP in 1968/69. In the five years 1963/64-1967/68 ELCOM's investments
represented about 3.3% of national investments and its current five-year
program foresees investments representing 3.8%.
v.        EICOM presently supplies power to nine centers of population
in the Territory. Three of these centers will be served by the project.
ELCCMT is also responsible for the operation and maintenance of generating



-ii-
and distribution facilities at 124 centers owned by the Administration.
Three of these centers will be transferred to EICOM and incorporated in
the system based on the project.
vi.       ELCOI4I's sales of energy have ilnereased by about 21% per year
on average over the past six years and a similar rate of growth is ex-
pected until 1977/78. A higher rate of growth of about 25% is, however,
expected in the area served by the project, the output of which will be
fully utilized in 1977/78.
vii.      Although demand for power is growing rapidly in the project
area, total demand is still small in relation to the potential offered
by the various hydroelectric sites. Accordingly, the Ramu development
has been divided into stages, and the project is the least-cost means
of supplying the forecast demand.  The rate of retu,rn on the extra capi-
tal required for the project compared with the cheapest thermal alter-
natives has an average expected value of 18%.
viii.     ELCOMi's management is able, and its staff is competent.  ELCOM
has had a trainiing program in operation since 1963, and it is expected
that by 1977/78, the proportion of expatriates on its staff (at present
42%) will be reduced to 5%. Its future financial position is in general
satisfactory. A tariff increase to produce 5% higher revenues became
effective January 1, 1971. The rate of return on its net fixed assets in
operation is forecast to improve from 4h7% in 1969/70 to 12.8% by 1977/78.
The internal financial rate of return on the project is over 17%.
ix.       Procurement, except consulting services, would be on the basis
of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guide-
lines.
x.        The proposed project would be a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$23.2 million equivalent for a period of 25 years, including a period
of grace of five years,



TERNITORY OF PAPJA AND NEW GUINEA
ELECTRICITY COliMISSION CF PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA
APPRAISAL OF TIlE FIRST PHASE CF THE UPPER RAM HYDROELECTRIC DEVELOPMENT
1. IMTRODUCTION
1.01      The Goverrment of the Commonwealth of Australia (the Common-
wealth) on behalf of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea (the Ter-
ritory) and the Electricity Commission of Papua and New Guinea (ELCOM)
has requested a Bank loan to finance the off-shore costs of the first
phase of the Upper Ramu No. 1 underground hydroelectric development
which it is planned to commission by mid-1975 with an installed capacity
of 45 ivW.
1.02      Under the UN1 Trusteeship Agreement (New Guinea) and the Com-
monwealth's Papua and New Guinea Act, the Commonwealth is responsible
for governing and developing the Territory. An Administrator appointed
by the Governor-General of the Commonwealth administers the Territory
but the Territory has its own legislature (House of Assembly) consisting
of 84 elected members and 10 official memrbers, which may make ordinances
to be presented to the Administrator for assent. The Administrator's
Executive Council (AEC) is also an important organ of government, and
the Administrator must accept its advice on specified matters which cover
a considerable area. It consists of seven ministerial office-holders
appointed from the House of Assembly, three official and one elected
member, and the Administrator himself. The ministerial office-holders
have full authority in certain specified matters subject only to the
AEC. A considerable step towards self-government has therefore already
been taken and the Commonwealth has indicated that the future of the
Territory is self-government and ultimately independence.
1.03      The present constitutional relationship between the Common-
wealth and the Territory is an interim one. Within the executive Gov-
ernment of the Territory there are a number of Authorities for which the
Commonwealth remains directly responsible. One such Authority is ELCOM.
Although established under Territory Ordinance, ELCON is required to
carry out directions given to it by the Commonwealth Mjinister of External
Territories or the Administrator on matters of policy relating to the
performance of its functions, duties, and powers.  Under self-government
ELCOM would become responsible to the Government of Papua and New Guinea.
1.04      ELCOM was established as a Statutory Corporation on July 1,
1963, wrhen it took over the functions of the Administration's Electrical
Undertaking Branch. On establishment, nine electric supply systems, each
serving a center of population, were transferred to EICONI and it assumed
full responsibility for them. The Ordinance also requires ELCOM to operate
and maintain generating and distribution facilities at other centers (i.e.
small settlements; there are 124 of them at present) owned by the Admnin-
istration, with funds provided by the Administration.  In time such cen-
ters could be transferred to ELCOI4, if transfer does not impose a financial
burden on ELCOM.



- 2 -
1.05      The project for which Bank assistance has been requested is
phase I of the Ramu No. 1 scheme.  It consists of an underground power
station, operated as a run-of-the-river plant with three 15 Ml units,
plus transmission facilities to Lae, Madang, Gorolka and lit. Hagen (see
Map).  Fhase 2 of the scheme consists of the construction of a dam on
the river to form a reservoir, and the installation of two more 15 MW
units. Until the commissioning of phase 2 in 1979 existing diesel-
electric generating capacity at Lae and Madang would serve as standby,
and would be utilized for peaking purposes and during periods of low
flow in the Ramu River. Afterwards the diesel units would be transferred
to other centers,
1.06      The project requires an estimated invest.ent of US$33.9 million,
of which the proposed loan of US$23.2 million would cover off-shore costs;
US$10.7 million would be local costs.
1.07      In addition to the places mentioned above, the project would
serve Kundiawa and Kainantu which lie on the route of the transmission
lines. Demand in all these places totalled 9.2 MV in 1969/70 and is
expected to be about 55 Ml by 1977/78 assuming an increase of about 25%
annually on average which is the rate of increase experienced over the
past six years. The area has a great potential for economic development.
The project would replace decentralized, costly, diesel generation.
1.08      The project was first presented to the Bank early in 1967 but
was considered premature because of the small demand in the early 1970s.
A preappraisal was carried out in July 1969, but an appraisal report was
deferred because disbursements would not be required until early in 1971.
In the interim period tender documents and specifications have been pre-
pared in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines and an appraisal was
carried out in October 1970.
1.09      This report was prepared by Messrs. E. A. Minnig (Power Engineer);
T. B. Russell (Economist); and F. Rydell (Financial Analyst) from infor-
mation prepared by ELCCO's consultants, and during field appraisals in
July 1969 and October 1970.

2. THE EC CONY AND THE POWLt SECTOR
The Territory and its Economy
2.01      The Territory of Papua and New Guinea extcends over 800,000 sq
mi of tropical seas north of Australia. The eastern half of New Guinea
and the three largest islands - New Britain, New Ireland and Bougainville
- comprise most of the land surface of 180,000 sq mi. It is an area of
unusual diversity with extremely rugged mountain ranges, wide valleys,
large river systems, extensive jungles and vast swamps.
2.02      Population at mid-1970 was estimated at 2Q4 million, including
about 49,000 non-indigenous.  The growth rate since the last census
(1966) has been about 2.6% per annum overall, but the non-indigenous
population - because of immigration attracted by economic prospects -
has been growing at 9% per annum. Average population is only 13 to the
sq mi but ranges from 1.5 to 60 according to district. The indigenous
population is overwihelmingly rural.  The largest towns are the capital,
Port Moresby, with a population in the neighborhood of 50,000, and Lae of
24,000.
2,03      The econcmy is based es3entially on primary production.  GNP
in 1968/69 was Us$512 millioni, equivalent to US$217 per capita, and the
average annual growth rate since 1965/66 has been 6.3%. There is still a
large subsistence sector, which supports the great majority of the indige-
nous population. The monetized sector has been growiing much more rapidly
(over 12% annually since 1965-66) and accounts for around 60% of GNP.  It
is based largely on plantation crops for export and on Government oper-
ations and services. Industrial output has been growing at about 15% per
annum; it accounted for 16% of GNP in 1968/69. GNP is projected to grow
at 5-6% per annum2/ under the current development program (1968/69 to
1972/73) and the monetized sector at 10%2/  These growth rates are esti-
mates made by the Bank's 1969 Economic 14ission.
Energy Resources
2e04      A recent survey indicated a vast hydro potential of some 6,000-
8,000 ZJ at sites capable of producing 300 MV or more.  Less than 1% of
the hydro potential is now being exploited. Most of the sites are too
large for development at present. There are no known economic deposits
of coal. Prospects for oil and gas of commercial value are considered
favorable following an off-shore gas strike in the Gulf of Papua. Fuel
oil has to be imported at present.  Fuel imports in 1968/69 were about
100,000 tons, of which ELCCI4's share for electricity generation was
about 8.5%.
1/ Preliminary Government estimate.
2/ These projections may have to be increased in view of much higher
growth rates reported for 1969/70.

The Po'lTer Sector
2,05      Virtually all power facilities were destroyed during WJorld lWar
II.  The Commonwealth Department of 1Uiorks (CCMWORKS) was made responsible
for reconstruction. In 1957 the 'Administration took over this respon-
sibility by creating the Electrical Undertaking Branch. On July 1, 1963
ELCOM was established and assumed full responsibility for nine centers.
It also provides the Administration wiith services at 124 other centers
owned by the Administration.
2.06      The nine centers served by ELCOO  and their populations ac-
cording to the last census (July 1966) are as follows: Port Moresby
(41,848), Iae (16,5i56), Rabaul (10,561), WTewak (8,945), IMadang (8,837),
Goroka (4,826), Swaarai (2,201), Kavieng (2,142), and Kokopo (537),  The
location of these centers together with the Administration centers are
shownn on the attached Map.
2.07      Outside the centers served by ELCOM or the Administration,
private generating equipment is generally installed by missions and
plantations. The largest private generating facility is owned by Placer
Development Ltd., a mining company wihich has vtrtually ceased operations
and nowa sells about twio-thirds of the power generated at its plant to
ELCOON for distribution in lae.
2.08      As of June 30, 1970 installed capacity and generation in the
Territory were as followJs:
Annual
Installed Capacity kW    Generation % of Total
I{ydro    Diesel    Total     Glh      Generation
ELCOM                    35.9       18.0      53.9     13h.7        67.3
Administration              -        6.1       6.1      19.0         9.5
Placer Development Ltd.   5.5         -        5.5      3508       18.0
Other Private              -         3.5       3.5      10.5         5.2
TOTAL               41.4      27.6       69.0     200.0      100.0
25,7 GWh was sold to ELCOII by Placer Development Ltd., so ELCOM's share
of power generated or purchased for distribution amounted to about 80%
of the total.  Per capita generation was about 83 kWh.
2.09      In the five years 1963/64-1967/68 ELCOM invested $A 14.4 mil-
lion (US$16.1 million), which wzas 3.3% of national investment in the
monetized sector in the period. Its investment program for 1968/69-
1972/73 calls for $A 31.5 million (US$35.3 million), which is 3.8% of
total projected investment in the monetized sector in this period.
2.10      The relationship between per capita power production and per
capita GNP is consistent iTth world trends as shown in the diagram,
Annex 1.  If the more recent figures from this report (paragrarhs 2e03 and
2.08 above) are plotted on this diagram the world trend is still closely
followed.



3. THE BORRCWER AND THE BENEFICIARY
3.01      The Borrower would be the Administration of the Territory of
Papua and New Guinea, the Guarantor the Commonwealth of Australia, and the
Beneficiary the Electricity Commission of Papua and New Guinea (ELCOM). A
Guarantee Agreement would be entered into between the Bank and the Common-
wealth, a Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Territory Administration,
a Project Agreement between the Bank and ELCOM, and a Subsidiary Loan
Agreement between the Territory Administration and ELCOM.
3.02      Lending direct to ELGOM would rnot only exclude any direct in-
volvement of the owner of ELCOM (i.e. the Territory) but also the Ter-
ritory's future Government. Since ELCOM's autonomy is limited as explained
in paragraph 1.03, and since ELCOM must also submit by-laws governing
tariffs, terms and conditions of supply, regulations and licences to the
Administrator for his approval, it is necessary that the Administration
also should have responsibility for the loan.
3.03      There is yet another reason for the arrangement explained in
paragraph 3.01. The various Ordinances governing the use of water in the
Territory for agriculture, forestry, mining, conservation, water supply
and power generation are in apparent conflict. The Local Government Ordi-
nance, for instance, reserves the right of a Council to supply light and
power within its area, without reference to ELCOM. ELCOM, therefore, has
no adequate powers to ensure that hydroelectric developments will be oper-
ated, planned or built to achieve maximum advantage for the whole economy.
Both the Commonwealth and the Territory are reluctant to make changes when
the Territory is moving rapidly to self-government. They consider that
changes should be made by an elected Government.
300       Apparent conflicts can best be avoided by lending directly to the
Territory Administration and entering into a Project Agreement with EBCOM.
To safeguard ELCOM's interest it is nevertheless considered essential that
the Guarantee and Loan Agreement should contain covenents stating that the
Territory Administration, or its successor, should consult with the Bank
prior to enacting any legislation affecting EBCOM, its future operations,
duties, functions, and powers. Because of legislative difficulties this was
not possible. In lieu of this a default condition was negotiated whereby the
Bank could suspend or cancel the loan should legislation be enacted which
would materially and adversely affect ELCOM.
ELCOM's Management and Organization
3.05      ELCOM is governed by a Commissioner (full-time) and four Associate
Commissioners (part-time) appointed by the Commonwealth Minister of External
Territories on the recommendation of the Administrator. Officers of the
Commission are appointed by the Commissioners and their terms and conditions
of employment are determined by the Minister.
3.o6      The Commissioner is due to retire on June 4, 1971.  He is both
chairman of the commission and EBCOM's general manager. Steps have been taken
to recruit a successor. It is considered desirable that a general manager
responsible for day-to-day operations be appointed at an early date, thus
freeing the Commissioner to concentrate on development and general matters



-6-
of policy. Steps have already been taken to reorganize top management
and three assistant general managers have been appointed responsible for
finance and administration, marketing, and engineering respectively.
Assurances were obtained that EICOM will consult with the Bank on new
appointments to the positions of general manager and assistant general
managers (finance and administration, and engineering). Annex 2 shows
ELCOM's proposed organizational structure which is sat-sfactory. Senior
staff are cormpetent.
3.07      ELCOM's establishment increased from a total of 779 as of
June 30, 1967 to 1,313 as of June 30, 1970 of which 335 were expatriates
and 978 were from the Territory. Included in this total were 508 trainees
and apprentices. Thus trained staff in service totals 805, giving a ratio
of one employee per 20 consumers.  Given ELCOM's area of operations this
number is not excessive, but economies can be achieved. ELCOM has now
engaged the services of the State Electricity Commissicn of Victoria to
review organization and methods. As a first step it is hoped to eliminate
some expatriate staff posts and some expatriates will be replaced by local
officers. During negotiations confirmation was obtained that ELCOM would
proceed with this policy.
3.08      In 1969/70 ELCOM spent about US$750,000 on training and education.
Since February 1967 a training center has offered courses for technicians.
With the help of its training program ELCOM expects to reduce the propor-
tion of expatriates on its staff from 42% (the present proportion) to 5%
by 1977/78. The training program is considered to be overly ambitious for
ELCOM's needs after 1977/78.  It is also questionable whether ELCOM should
finance all training costs estimated at about $A 460,000 per annum from
1972 onwards since after completion of their course some trainees find
employment in the private sector and others in Administration centers.
3.09      The future of the training center will be reviewed when the State
Electricity Commission of Victoria's study of ELCOM's organization and
methods (paragraph 3.07) has been completed. The Administration has agreed
to give ELCOM an annual subsidy of $A 90,000 to ease the financial burden
of training for reasons outlined above. During negotiations confirmation
was obtained that (a) ELCOM will review by December 31, 1971, future man-
power requirements and intake of trainees; and (b) the Administration will
provide ELCOM annually up to and including fiscal 1978 an annual subsidy
of not less than $A 90,000 for training.
Existing Facilities
3.10      To serve the nine centers for which it is directly responsible
ELCOM had available at June 30, 1970 a total of 53.9 W of generating
equipment to serve a demand of 32.0 MW, Of this capacity 35.9 MS was
hydro and 18.0 MW diesel. Annex 3 lists the individual power plants.
3.11      Annex 4 lists ELCOM's transmission and distribution facilities
by center and voltage. Supply point transformer statistics are given in
Annex 5. Annex 6 gives a list of distribution substations. Both supply
point and distribution transformer facilities are adequate.

4. THE PCWER MARKET
4 01      Principal statistics for the years 1963/64 and 1969/70 and aver-
ages for the period as a whole are listed below to show the growth of
ELC0iqVs service, The detailed figures are given in Annexes 7, 8 and 9.
Growvth was from a small starting base, and it reflects correspondingly
rapid expansion of the monetized sector of the economy. Potential demand
is understated because there was some shedding or restriction of load,
especially at Port Moresby, in the latter part of this period.

4.02      The increasing proportion of industrial sales has been a factor
in the improvement of the annual system load factor. ELCOII has made a
forecast of sales to 1977/78 and expects the same rate of growth in total
sales of 21% to continue, but with little change in losses or system load
factor (Annexes 10 and 11). The achievement of this rate is considered
feasible in view of the prospects for economic growth and the assumption
by ELCOM of responsibility for additional load centers.
4.03      The higher rate of growth of sales in the area to be served by
the project reflects a lower starting base as well as the rapid pace of
develoFment there. Continuation of the past average growth rate in sales
of about 25% per annum is forecast by ELCOM up to 1977/78 (Annex 10).
This forecast also seems feasible in the light of the excellent economic
prospects of the area (Annex 12), and falls within the range of alternative
projections made as a check (see paragraph 6.02 and Annex 13). Annexes 1l
and 15 show in diagrammatic form generation, sales and maximun demand for
EIC400 and for the project's service area.

5. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ELCOMIS FACILITIES
5.01      ELCOM envisages a program of new works to ensure that the
growing demand can be met. Its investigations have been carr-ied out in
sufficient detail and the conclusions drawn are in general satisfactory.
Port Moresby Area
5.02      ELCOM's consultants, COMCRKS, have investigated further hydro
developments on the Laloki River to serve this area. As a first step they
recommended raising the Sirinumu dam. Construction started late in 1969
and should be finished early in 1972.
5.03      As a second step COMUORKS recommended the construction of two
further hydro plants, Rouna No. 3 (12 MFI) and Rouna No. h (9 Mu) for com-
missioning late in 1974 and 1976 respectively. It is questionable whether
Rouna No. 4 is justified in view of its high specific cost of $A 610kW. -
Nevertheless it is included in the program subject to review at the appro-
priate time. The potential of the Laloki River would be fully utilized
if these two hydro plants were built.  Developments on other rivers are
being investigated (Vanapa, Angabunga, and IMusa) as further sources of
power for Port Moresby, but they appear to be too large or too far awiay.
ELCON is therefore investigating a 30 14W diesel station at Baruni near
Port Moresby to meet demand after 1976.
5.04      Investments in generating facilities in the Fort Moresby area
for the period 1970/71-1977/78 are estimated at about $A 18.7 million.
Upper Ramu Area
5.05      COI4tJORKSt first reports on the Upper Ramu and a report on hy-
drology prepared by the SnowTy Msountains Authority (SMA), were submitted
to the Bank early in 1967; analysis showed that construction should be
deferred at least for five years. The Bank recommended further geological
and economic investigations since the potential of the Upper Ramu River
could be developed in one stage of 276 MU (6 x 46 MUl) or in two stages,
Ramu No. 1 and Ramu No. 2 of 75 MIW and 180 I&I respectively. A geological
report prepared by the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics
of the Commonwealth Department of National Development preceded reports
prepared by C01VORKS in M4arch 1968 and by SMA in June 1968, Extensive
exploratory drilling was carried out to locate the principal structures of
the scheme.  A final report prepared by CCI4WORKS in July 1969 reviewed
economic aspects.
5.o6      The estimated cost of a single-stage development is about
$A 88.0 million or $A 320/kW, and of a two-stage development $A 103.5
million or $A 405/kwl. Given the power market to be served which cannot
be enlarged to include other areas because of the distances involved,
COMUORKS concluded that a two-stage development is economically more
attractive in terms of total costs on a discounted basis and that the
smaller scheme should be built first. Further refinement of the analy-
sis showed the economic advantage of retaining for standby and peaking



-9-
purposes available diesel generating capacity at Iae and Madang to firm up
Ramu No. 1 if initially constructed as a run-of-the-river plant. Thus
construction of the dam estimated to cost $A 17.2 million to firm up out-
put could be deferred until at least 1978/79. These conclusions are satis-
factory and acceptable and the supporting investigations (geology, drilling)
are adequate. Annex 16 shows a plan and profile of the two-stage develop-
ment and Annex 17 a plan and profile of the Ramu No. 1 development.
5.07      Investments necessary in this area in the period 1970/71-1977/78
total about $A 56.2 million of which the project (Ramu No. 1 first-phase)
would account for about $A 30.3 million. The second-phase (dam plus two
additional 15 IST units) accounts for the remaining sum.
Other Investment
5.08      About 32.4 IW  of diesel generating equipment will be installed
up to 1977/78 to serve the remaining areas as follows:  2.1 INr at Wewak;
8 111 at Rabaul; 0.5 W3J at Kavieng; 13.6 HI at Iae; 4.5 MW at Yadang; and
3.7 124 at Goroka.  In addition a 0.2 III hydro set would be added to the
existing plant at Goroka.  New diesel sets at Lae, Tadang and Goroka
during 1971-1974 are necessary to meet increases in load which will occur
before the commissioning of the Project.
5.09      Investments in generating facilities in these centers for the
period 1970/71-1977/78 are estimated at about $A 6.9 million.
5.10      Over the period 1970/71-1977/78 investments in transmission
facilities, apart from the Upper Ramu area, and distribution expansion in
all ELCOM1 centers would require $A 7.7 million.
5.11      Other construction would require investments of about $A 5.3
million.

6. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Load Growth
6.01      The project would supply six load centers in New Guinea at present
not interconnected and supplied by independent diesel plants except for
two small hydro units.  ELCOM,I is already responsible for supply at lae and
Madang (the main ports of New Guinea) and Goroka, the center of the coffee
growing industry, and is due to assume responsibility for Yt. Hagen, Kundiawa
and Kainantu. Total generation at the first three places nearly quadrupled
between 1963/64 and 1969/70 (see Annex 7),
6.02      As al-eady indicated, ELCON expects growth of about 25% per annum
on average over the next eight years in this area, although the rate is
expected to decline to about 17% by 1978. As already stated (paragraph
4.03) the rate forecast seems reasonable but, as a check, three independent
projections were made based on past relationships between electricity gen-
eration, monetized GNP, industrial output and expatriate population in the
Territory, and estimates of the future trends of the last three variables
(Annex 13). These projections suggest average annual growth rates ranging
from about 20% to 26%,s compared with the ELCON figure of 255%, and were
taken into account in examining the economic justification of the project,
as described below,
Economic Comparison of Alternatives
6.03      COMIQORXS examined alternative ways of meeting the projected
load growth. The least cost thermal alternative (in present worth terms)
was determdned by a process of elimination.  It proved to be a central
steam station at Lae burning imported fuel oil. A similar procedure was
followed for the hydro possibilities and indicated that the project was
the least cost hydro development.  Details are given in Annex 18.
6.o4      The project has higher capital costs but much lower running
costs than the thermal plant at Lae.  Comparison was based on the dis-
counted cash flowJs of the two over a period of 50 years.  To allow for
uncertainties, probability analysis was used to establish the mean value
and range of variation of the discount rate which equalized the present
worths of the two alternatives, assuming three different values, with
corresponding probabilities assigned to them, for each of the main vari-
ables (future load growth, capital costs and oil price). The procedure
is described in Annex 18 and the results sunmmarized below.:
IMIean value of equalizing discount rate (R)     18%
Standard deviation of (R)                       2.5%
Range of (R) (95% probability)                13-23%
6.05      On the assumptions adopted, there is less than a 3% probability
that the equalizing discount rate would be below 13%. This is satisfactory,
since the opportunity cost of capital in the Territory for low risk projects
is believed to be below this figure.



7. THE PROJECT
7Q01      An explanation has already been given of the economic advantage
of dividing hydroelectric exploitation of the Upper Ramu into two separate
schemes, raferred to as No. 1 and No. 2, and of further subdividing No. 1
scheme into two phases of which phase 1 is the project appraised in this
report.  Fhase 1 would utilize the head made available by cutting across
a bend in the Ramu River. An intake weir in the river would form a head-
pond, from which water would be diverted down a concrete-lined shaft to
the turbines in an underground machine haill   Here the three 15 WI Francis-
turbine-driv en generating units would be installed but the hall would be
built with space for twTo more units. A surge chamber would be excavated
immediately downstream from the machine hall, from which the tailrace
tunnel, which would be about a mile and a half in length, would lead back
to the river, The intake weir would have movable gates. A hoist house,
control building, transformer compound and switchyard iwould be built on
the surface close by. An access shaft for personnel and equipment would
lead dowi to the machine hall. About 300 miles of 66/132 kV transmission
lines would connect the project to the principal load cernters of Lae,
Hadang, Goroka and It. Hagen.  Principal data for the project are listed
in Annex 19, and both No. 1 and No, 2 schemes are showrn on Annexes 16 and
17, where the project is shoan in red.
7.02      The headpond of the project would have storage sufficient to
permit daily regulation of the flow. A firm capacity of about 22 MW gives
an output of firm energy of about 135 GlJh annually; the total possible out-
put of the project is estimated to be about 230 GEE, in a year of average
rainfall. Thus with about 23 MN of diesel capacity retained for standby
and peaking purposes, system firm capacity would total 45 PAJ. Annex 20
discusses hydrological aspects in more detail.
7.03      The exploratory drilling and geological investigations which
have been carried out indicate that underground conditions should be
favorable for construction, that little support will be needed, and that
only very slight inflows of water will be experienced. Annex 21 discusses
these matters in detai'l.
7.0o      The region is, however, one of rather high seismicity.  An earth-
quake of intensity 9 on the Mercalli scale can be expected every 50 years.
All engineering structures wrill be designed accordingly and, when phase 2
is built, it will be necessary to pay special attention to the stability
of the dam.
Cost Estimate
7.05      A detailed estimate given in Annex 22 is summarized belowi.  An
allowance of about 15% of the cost of underground works has been included
for unknowm geological conditions and it has been assumed that 20Po of the
tailrace tunnel (although designed as an unlined tunnel) will be fully
lined. In addition there is a contingency allowyance for unestimated items
of about 8% of estimated costs.  An allowance of 5% per annun has been



-12-
made to cover increases in labor costs and costs of imported equipment;
it amounts to about 16% of the total cost without contingencies. The cost
of the Rouna No. 2 hydro development was utilized as a basis for this
estimate because of identical layouts and recent commissioning., If the
contingency and price increase allowances are not utilized, or there are
other savings, such savings would be cancelled.

The proposed Bank loan would cover the off-shore costs of the project
amounting to US$23.2 million.
Procurement and Disbursement
7.06      Procurement, except consulting services, would be on the basis
of international competitive bidding in accordance with the BankTs Guide-
lines dated August 1969. Specifications and tender documents are being
prepared and some (electro-mechanical, preliminary works and main civil
works) have already been approved by the Bank. Disbursements would be
made only for the actual off-shore c.i.f. costs of equipment and materials
and for the off-shore cost of civil works, installation, erection and
consulting services as specified in the contracts. Australian manufacturers,
contractors and consultants would be considered eligible for disbursements
from the proposed loan. This has been the case with past loans to the
Territory. A disbursement schedule is given in Annex 23.

Construction Schedule
7.07      Tenders for the electro-mechanical equiprient have been reviewed
cy the Bank and were issued in January 1971.  Construction is estinated -
to start in August 1971 and the first two units are scheduled for cormmis-
sioning in June 1975 and the third unit in September 1975. The program
is reasonable and the target dates should be achieved. Further details
are given in Annex 24.
Consultants
7.08      ELCOM has engaged the Australian Commonwealth Department of Works
(COOWORKS) as its prime consultant, and Preece, Cardew and Rider (UK con- --
sultants) to expedite delivery and supervise manufacture of imported equip-
ment. The terms and conditions of both contracts are satisfactory, During
ne.xotiations asrsuxanceB were. _btain'ed&th,t  CtOc-oud coi'tinife to eriploy
consultants satisfactory to the Bank.
Fcological Aspects
7.09      Rzsettlement.  There are no villages in the area to be acquired
for the project nor in the storage area of phase 2. Villagers have planted
coffee along the river flats; relocation will not disrupt the economy of
the area if carried out early. Iand required for the project is minimal
and there are no competing claims for it.
7.10      Health.  The Territory Department of Public Health has reviewed
the health aspects of the Ramu scheme. The only serious apparent health
hazard, in the Department's view, is malaria.  With construction of the
dam and resulting earth movement in phase 2, extensive breeding sites for
mosquitos would be created unless protective measures are taken. During
negotiations confirmation was obtained from the borrowrer ant1 the bene-
ficiary that all measures -'ould be undertaken to eliminate this risk, and to
protect the work force and surrounding population from any health hazard
vihich would be introduced and/or enhanced by construction of the project.
Confirmation wras obtained, that a conprehensi4e ecological study iTould
oe undertaken by qualified experts satisfactory to the Bank, prior to the
design stage of Ramu 1 phase 2 which involves a major water storage area,
7.11      Environment.  No other adverse ecological impact is expected.
The future storage area (phase 2) could become a public recreation area
and may even have potential for development as a national park.
Internal Financial Rate of Return of the Project
7.12      The internal financial rate of return of the project is defined
as the discount rate which equates the present values of the project's
capital and operating costs over its life, plus associated distribution
costs, and the stream of revenues attributable to it. The internal fi-
nancial rates of return are 17.5% for the whole project service area,

8.  FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Record and Present Position
8.01      In its first year of operation, 1963/64) ELCCIY earned a 7.3%
rate of return on its average net fixed assets in operation. (See para-
graph 8.o4 for valuation of fixed assets.) During the next three years,
1964/65 through 1966/67, operation improved and the average annual rate
of return increased to about 12.7%. Operating results deteriorated in
the following three years and the annual rate of return declined to 8.4%
in 1967/68, and to 4.7,% in 1968/69 and 1969/70.  Revenues were based on
tariffs each of which reflected the cost of service in its particular area.
As shown in Annexes 9 and 11 the average revenue per kl1h sold is higher
in the Upper Ramu area than other areas. This fact is attributed to smaller
operating systems and lower load factors. The tariff schedule as of
December 31, 1970, is shown in Annex 25. A detailed presentation of the
operating results for the most recent five-year period is shown in Annex 26.
8.02      Four factors contributed to the decline in earnings during the
last three years. They were:
(i)  Tariff reductions on July 1, 1968 in the Lae, Rabaul and
HIadang areas to make charges more equitable to these con-
sumers compared to consumer charges in other areas;
(ii)  a substantial increase in training costs;
(iii) establishment of an appliance and repair center which ran
at a loss; and
(iv)  an increase in personnel (see paragraph 3.07).
8.03      ELCOII's financial position at June 30 of each year from 1966
through 1970 is shown in Annex 27. The financial position at June 30,
1970 is summarized in the following condensed balance sheet.

1/ Includes $A 534,000 (US$598,080) long-term debt due within one year.
8.04      Included in the net fixed assets in operation are the original
fixed assets, valued at $A 5.8 million, taken over by ELCOM from the Admin-
istration (paragraph 1.04). These assets were valued on the basis of a
comprehensive survey carried out by engineers and officers of the Electrical
Undertakings Branch and the Treasury Department, and for the most part were
valued at original cost less accumulated depreciation. This valuation is
reasonable and acceptable.
8.05      In the Territory of Papua and New Guinea most land is classified
as native land, public land, and to a much smaller extent, freehold land.
Public land in private use is on a 99-year leasehold basis. At the time
of the transfer of assets to ELCOM no valuation was assigned to land. It
vas assumed that land and land/water rights associated with the transferred
assets would be automatically vested with ELCOM. Furthermore, in some cases
ELCOM did not acquire land or land/water rights when it subsequently expanded
its power system. During the appraisal it was agreed that ELCOM would present
to the Bank at the time of negotiations evidence satisfactory to the Bank that
it has proper authority to use the land and water related to its operations.
"his was not possible. Nevertheless confirmation was obtained during negotia-
tions that the necessary steps to provide ELCOM with the proper authority
were under way and the provisior. of satisfactory evidence made a condition of
effectiveness.
8.o6      Long-term investments amounting to tA 2.1 million consist of the
following: self-insurance sinkirng fund, $A 0.8 rdllion; administration loan



-16-
sinking fund, $A 1.0 million; and a voluntary redemption sinking fund,
$A 0.3 million which relates to debt incurred for the original assets trans-
ferred to ELCOM from the Administration (paragraph 8.oh). Most of these
sinking funds are invested in long-term securities of the Territory.
8.07      The current financial position, as reflected by a current ratio
of 1.6/1.0 (including current maturities of long-term debt) appears satis-
factory, but most of the current assets are tied up in stores inventory and
receivables and a cash shortage existed at June 30, 1970. Cash on hand was
only $A 9X000 and ELCOM was also carrying a $A 100,000 bank overdraft. The
cash balance at the end of each of the last five years has never exceeded
$A 11,000 and each year also showed bank overdrafts varying between $A 29,000
and $A 386,ooo. The year-ending overdrafts are required to meet the substan-
tial debt service payments on Administration loans which are due on June 30
of each year. Past records show that ELCOM repaid these overdrafts promptly.
8.08      Since 1963, the Administration has provided funds to ELCOM in the
form of long-term sinking fund loans. These loans mature after either 25 or
40 years, depending on the type of assets being financed. The legal instru-
ment covering each such loan contains a clause in which ELCOM's total assets,
both present and future, are pledged as security for the interest and repay-
ment of principal. Another clause establishes precedence over all other funds
subsequently borrowed by ELCOM, Therefore it was agreed that the proposed
subsidiary loan, under which the Administration would relend the Bank funds to
ELCOM, would rank pari passu with all existing Administration loans to ELCGM.
8.o9      ELCOM's equity consists only of accumulated earned surplus and
several reserve accounts. Its past expansion was financed primarily by long-
term loans. Therefore, ELCOM has always had a high debt/equity ratio, which
is not unusual for government owned utilities.  This ratio was 92/8 on June 30,
1966 and had reduced only slightly to 88/12 on June 30, 1970. Long-term debt
included $A 5.8 million which is the liability for the assets originally trars-
ferred to ELCOM from the Administration. The transfer agreement requires
ELCOM to pay annual interest at the rate of 5% but repayment of principal is
not required except as may be determined by the Minister of External Terri-
tories. Because of its top-heavy debt structure and this potential demand
liability of $A 5.8 million, ELCOM has requested the Administration's per-
mission to convert this obligation from debt to equity. Assurances were ob-
tained during negotiations that this conversion would become effective on or
before July 1, 1971.
Auditing
8.10      ELCOM has its own internal audit staff under the direction of a
professionally qualified expatriate auditor. As required under Section 23 of
the Electricity Commission Ordinance, ELCOIM is audited annually by the Auditor-
General's Office of the Commonwealth. These auditing arrangements are satis-
factory. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that ELCOM would cnn-
tinue to employ auditors satisfactory to the Bank.
Accounting
8.11      ELCOM has a capable accounting staff and employs a satisfactory
accounting system. However, its financial statements do not conform to



- 17 -
those usually found in public utility practice. An amendment to its by-laws
made mandatory the detailed form of financial statements prescribed therein,
This requirement does not permit any flexibility in the use of accounts and
it is impossible to record unusual transactions properly without amending
the by-laws. During negotiations assurances vere obtained that this
amend-lrent 'Tould be canre1oA since the Ordinance already requires MIW't to
maintain its accounts "in accordance with the accounting principles generally
applied in commercial practice."
Insurance
8.12      ELCCI4 practices self-insurance by charging operations annually
with an amount estilmated to be equivalent to the insurance premiums that
would have been paid if insurance policies had been in effect and by making
annual deposits to an insurance sinking fund account. ELCOM intends to
engage an insurance consultant to determine the adequacy of this plan, and
if necessary to revise it. During negotiations, assurances assurances uiere
obtained that such action would be undertaken.

8.14      Net internal cash generation, estimated at about $A 25.5 million,
or about 35% of the total fund requirement, is a reasonable contribution on
the part of ELCOM towards financing its expansion program. To generate t1lese
funds ELCOM introduced a 5% tariff increase effective on January 1, 1971.
8.15      The proposed borrowiing would be as follows:
Amount
($A millio`n)
IBRD loan                          20.7
Future foreign loans                9.4
Adainistration loans               14;5
Suppliers' credits                  1.7
Total                         125
8.16      The financial projections assume that the proposed BanL: loan would
be for 25 years including a period of grace of five years with a rate of
interest of 7S. The future foreign loans would cover the foreign exchange
costs of the Rouna No. 4 ($A 6.3 million equivalent) and Baruni (diesel -
$A 3.1 million) projects, It is too early for ELCOM to consider arranging
loans for these two projects since the funds will not be required until
fiscal 1973/74 and thereafter.  It has been assumed that these loans would
have terms of 25 years (including a five-year grace period), and 20 years
(including a three-year grace period), respectively, both with a rate of
interest of 7%.
8.17      The Administration agreed during the appraisal that it would
provide ELCGM with two sinking fund loans of $A 5.0 million each in 1971/72
and 1972/73 with maturities of 40 years. Wvhile the Administration's long-
range plan has tentatively earmarked annual loans of $A 3.0 million to ELCCM
in succeeding years, the financial forecast indicates that a loan of $A 3.0
million will be required in 1973/74 but only $A 1.5 million in 1974/75. I14cvT
ever, during negotiations assurances were obtained that in the event of
a shortage of funds during the period of project construction, the Common-
wealth of Australia, as guarantor, or the Administration, wc-ald provide ECGM
with such funds or make other satisfactory financial arrangements to complete
the project.  In addition, assurances were obtained from EILCOM that,
prior to undertaking any future construction project costing in excess of
$A 10.0 million, it vould provide ., financiil plan aatisiactory to thf: Bank
covering such project.
8.18      Proposed suppliers' credits would finance foreign costs of various
diesel plants scheduled for 1971/72 and 1972/73. Assumed terms for these
credits are 8% interest and repayment over six years.
8.19      Details of the financial plan are shown in Annex 28.  During
construction of the project (1970/71 through 1975/76), EICAI's gross fixed
assets in operation plus work in progress would increase about 2.7 times.
aased on the forecasts, the financing of this expansion program is considered
firm, with the exception of the future foreign loans of $A 9.4 million. The
financial plan is reasonable.



-19-
Financial Forecasts
3.20      Operating results 1970/71 through 1977/78 are shown in Annex 26e
ELCOM is expected to achieve a rate of return of 6.3% in 1970/71 (compared
with a return of h.7% in the previous year) which ref'lects a 5,% tariff in-
crease during the last half of the fiscal year. The return should increase
to 9% in 1971/72 when the increased tariff will have been in effect for the
entire year. During the next three years, the rate of return should exceed
10%. In 1975/76, when the project is scheduled for operation, the rate of
return declines to 9.5% because of the substantial increase in ELCOM's rate
base. Thereafter the rate of return should again exceed 10%. To assure
satisfactory operations in the future it was agreed that ELCOM would not
lower its tariffs during the years 1971/72 through 1975/76, and earn a rate
of return of not less than 9% in the fiscal years 1972 through 1976 and not
less than 10%l thereafter.
8.21      ELCOM's projected balance sheets are shown in Annex 27. The
financial position is satisfactory throughout the eight-year period, 1970/71
through 1977/78.  The current ratio (including current maturities of long-
term debt) is satisfactory, varying between 1.2/1.0 to 1.5/110, but the esti-
mated cash available at the end of each year is still not sufficient to meet
the heavy sinking fund payments on Administration loans without carrying a
year-end overdraft of $A 0.3 million. To conserve cash during the construc-
tion period of the project, assurances were obtained that prior to June 30,
1978, ELCOM would not declare any dividends.
8.22      The balance sheet at June 30, 1972 includes for the first time an
Administration equity investment account, amounting to about $A 6.7 million.
About $A 5.8 million of this sum represents the value of the assets to be
transferred to ELCOM. The balance of about $A 0.9 million is the estimated
value of the assets at Kieta on Bougainville Island which will be transferred
to ELCOM. The Administration has agreed to accept an equity investment in
the amount of $A 6.7 million as full settlement for the total of these assets.
The Administration equity investment account will be further increased by
about $A 1.3 million in 1975/76 when ELCCM is expected to take over the
distribution systems at lit. Hagen, Kundiawa and Kainantu, on completion of
the project. Assurances were obtained that the value of any additional assets
transferred to ELCOM in the future would be offset by an equivalent increase
in the Administration equity investment account.
8.23      ELCOM and the Administration have informally agreed that power
systems transferred to ELCOM in the future will be accounted for separately
and that the Administration will subsidize any operating losses of these
systems. Financial forecasts indicate that the four systems mentioned above
should be profitable. Because of the possibility of transferring to ELCOM
unprofitable systems in the future, the Administration formally agreed to
subsidize any such systems' losses.
8.24      ELCOM's 88/12 debt/equity ratio at June 30, 1971 is expected to
improve to about 67/33 at June 30, 1978. However, to maintain a satisfactory
debt/equity ratio throughout the life of the proposed Bank loan, assurances
were obtained that ELCOM would not incur any debt additional to the debts
described in the financial plan (paragraphs 8.15 through 8.13) unless internal
cash generation is sufficient to cover the maximum future debt serrine, inclu-
ding service on any proposed loan, by not le:33 than 1.5 times.



-20-
9. RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
points:
(a) The Administration's original investment in ELCOM will
be converted from long-term debt to equity (para. 8.09);
(b)  in the event of a shortage of funds, the Administration
and/or the Commonwealth Government will provide such
funds to ELCOM, or make other satisfactory financial
arrangements, as may be required to complete the project
(para. 8.17); and
(c) assets subsequently transferred to ELCOM from the
Administration will be recorded as equity investments
(para. 8.22).
9.02      The subsidiary loan, under which the Administration would relend
the Bank funds to ELCOM, will rank pari passu with all existing Administra-
tion loans to ELCOM (para. 8.03). --
9.03      A condition of effectiveness of the loan is the presentation
to the Bank of satisfactory evidence that ELCOM has proper authority to use
land and water necessary for its operations.
9.oh      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$23.2 million to the Administration for a term of 25 years including a
5 year grace period, to be relent to ELCOM4 on the same terms.

TERRITORY OF PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA
ELECTRICITY COMMISSION OF PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA
Economic Trends and Prospects in the Area to be Served
by the Upper Ramu Hydroelectric Project
1.        As a check on the ELCOM load forecast, which assumes a contin-
ued high rate of economic growth in the Upper Ramu service area, visits
were made to the main load centers to review current developments. These
confirmed the excellent growth prospects of the area, as described below.
LAE
2.        This is the chief town and port in New Guinea and second only
to Port Noresby in the Territory as a whole. It is the most important
of the load centers which would be served by the Upper Ramu Scheme.  Ihx-
imum demand in 1968/69 was 4,450 kW and generation 23.8 GWh. These fig-
ures represented average annual increases since 1963/64 of 21.250 and
27.8% respectively.
3.        This high rate of growth reflects the pace of population growth
and industrial development. Since the 1966 census, population has grown
on average at 10.4% per annum of which indigenous 10.2% and non-indige-
nous 11.3%, giving a total of 24,339 inhabitants in 1970, including 4,675
non-indigenous. No figures are available showing the trend of industrial
output in Lae but the followiing statistics of annual tonnage of cargo
handled by the port give an indication of the rate of economic growth:
Annual Tonnage              Average annual
1960/61   196/5   196d/69    growth rate 1961-69
in /%
Exports           31,290    38,225    69,h85             10.5
Imports           53,253   102,092   2hl,50              20.8
Total          84,543  10,317   310,989              17.7
4.       Existing industries include a brewery, saw mills, industrial
gases, paints, steel fabrication, agricultural fertilizers (mixing), nail
and wire manufacture. Most of these have been established in the last
few years and expansion rates have been generally higher than was antici-
pated when they were set up. Thus the industrial gases plant is about
to increase capacity by 75% to meet the expected increase in demand; out-
put of paints has been increasing at over 12% a year; capital invested in
the nail and wire plant has nearly trebled since operations began in 1964;

and the brewery, whose output has been expanding at about 20% per annum
is expected to expand further at a rate of 20-25% over the next three
years.
5.        There are no signs of any slackening in the pace of economic
development. Business confidence in the future of the town is high.
New industries being established or planned include tire retreading,
soap, fiber glass, plastics, packaging, tanning and cement. No projec-
tion of the future trend of total industrial output is available but,
according to a semi-official estimate, the value of output from new in-
dustries expected to be established over the next few years will rise
from about $A 2 million in 1969/70 to over $A 10 million in 1972/73.
6.        There are plans to double the wharf capacity in the port to
cope with the anticipated increase in tonnage of cargo handled. Accord-
ing to projections in the 1969 UYTTP Transport Survey / this is expected to
reach 490,000 tons by 1972/73, though a slowing-down in the rate of
growth is expected thereafter owing to routing of cargo through Madang
with construction of the Mount Hagen-Nadang road.
7.        A new town area has been designated three miles outside the
present town for further industrial, commercial and residential develop-
ment. Inquiries for the allocation of plots for industrial enterprises
are being received at the rate of at least 12 a month. A possible ob-
stacle to growth in the longer term may be a shortage of land for fur-
ther urban development. Another problem may be a shortage of skilled
labor over the next few years, particularly with the huge copper mining
development under construction on Bougainville Island which is already'
tending to draw away from the mainland some of the scarce resources of
skilled manpower. There is confidence, hcuever, that these obstacles
will be overcome and will not retard the pace of development. Apart
from offering competition for skilled labor, the impact of the Bougainville
project on the area is expected to be favorable, though it is too early
to measure this and it has not been taken into account in any of the
existing development plans and projections for the town.
8.        The plans for further industrial and commercial developments
are expected to result in the following new loads over the next few
years, which would be additional to the normal growth in the require-
ments of existing consumers:
1970/71   1971/72   1972/73   1973/74
M4aximum demand in kW         1,040      660        625       6h0
These figures do not include any allowance for the cement factory or
tannery which may be established within this period. Nor do they allow

for the establishment of rice growing on a large scl le in the IaLrkham
Valley about 30 miles outside Lae, where prospects for this crop are
considered very good. If this development takes place, processing of
the crop would be carried out wTithin the  rid areas served by the Upper
ramu Scheme. The total Territory requiremetnts of rice are estimated
at 35,000 tons and if this&quaritity were .=ciGm in the area the esti-
mated additional power requirements for processing are 2,000 kIJ.
MADANG
9.         2adang is the second town and port in New Guinea and the sec-
ond most important load center after Lae. Electricity generated in
1968/69 was 8.4 GWh compared with 3.7 GWh in 1963/64 representing an av-
erage annual growth rate over the period of 17.8%. I4aximum dernand rose
from 850 kW to 1,790 kW during the period, an average increase of 16.1%
per annum.
10.       The total 1970 population is estimated at 11,151, including
1,561 expatriates. This compares with the 1966 census figure of 8,732
(including 1,h28 expatriates), representing an average growth rate of
6.3% per annum overall.
11.       These growth rates have been achieved despite the adverse
effects of the opening of the all weather road from Lae to the Highlands
(Mt. Hagen). Previously large amounts of imported goods and materials
for the Highlands were shipped into Madang and air freighted from there
into the interior. The new Lae-Highlands road has made it cheaper to
ship much of this freight to Lae and transport it from there by road.
The effect on the volume of traffic through Madang port is shown by the
following figures of cargo tonnages handled since 1961:
Annual Tonnage
1960/61        1965/66         1966/67        1968/69
Exports         23,978          29,234         27,632          26,450
Imports         3h,183          90,889         67,852          62,570
Total      58,161        120,123          95,h8h          89,020
12.       According to projections in the UNDP Transport Survey, the
situation is expected to improve in the early 1970's following the com-
pletion of an all weather road linking acadang to the Highlands. The
projections are as follows:
Annual Tonnage
1972/73      1977/73
Exports            63,100         79,400
Imports            48000        18h,000
Total        111,100        263,h00

13.       Existing industries include a tobacco factory, steel fabrica-
tion, construction, furniture, marine engine and ship repairing, soft
drinks and printing. Statistics showing the trend of industrial output
in the town are not available but the estimated total value of indus-
trial output in 1966/67 for Madang district, of which Madang is the chief
town, was about $A 35 million.
14.       New industries planned or proposed include a wood chip plant,
corrugated iron manufacture, an abattoir and a printing works. Other pos-
sibilities being discussed are cement brick manufacture, motor car assem-
bly by a Japanese firm and extension of the servicing facilities for the
Australian Navy. The town is also well situated to take advantage of the
developing tourist traffic in the South Pacific area and hotel acconmodation
is already being expanded. The airport is also being improved.
15.       The most important of the potential industrial developments is
wood chip manufacture. Japanese interests have been carrying out a pilot
operation using timbers in the Gogal area about 25 miles west of Madang.
If negotiations now in train are successful, a major new export industry
will develop, with a load estimated to rise to 4,300 kW by 197h.
16.       Other possibilities are:
(i) Manufacture of copra by-products. Most of the country's
copra production is shipped through Madang and the tonnage
is rising fairly rapidly. A local firm has already start-
ed manufacture of machine twisted fiber and charcoal from
the copra shell and is experimenting with powdered shell
for plastic manufacture. The main outlets for these by-
products would be Japan;
(ii) a cocoa butter factory; and
(iii)  a battery manufacturing plant.
17.       The town has certain advantages with respect to future expan-
sion.  It has a fine natural harbor and a new wharf recently completed
which can berth deep draft ships up to 500 ft in length. The present
wharf capacity is only about 50% utilized. Land is plentiful and cheap
and there is no shortage of labor.
18.        On the basis of present intentions and plans the following new
loads are expected to be connected over the next few years (the figures
in parentheses are the incremental growth attributable to the proposed
wood chip factory):

These figures do not include any allowance for the possible establish-
ment of a cocoa butter factory.
GOROKA
19.       Goroka is the main center for the coffee growing industry in
the Highlands and has been developing rapidly in recent years. The av-
erage growth rate of indigenous population between 1966 and 1970 was
about 13% per annum and of expatriates 12%. Population in 1970 was es-
timated at 7,882, including 1,471 expatriates.  Power requirements have
also increased rapidly.  MIaximum demand rose at nearly 274J% per annum
between 1964L and 1969, from 346 kW to 1,160 kW. Energy generated rose
at 28.1% per annum over the period, from 1.3 Gah to 14.5 GCAh.
20.       Coffee processing is the main local industry, seven factories
operating in the area.  The other leading local produce industry is pas-
sion fruit pulp, which is exported to -Australia for use in soft drink
manlufacture.  A tobacco factory has recently been established.  The tour-
ist industry has also been developing rapidly though it is still on a re-
latively small scale. A large Government hospital (400 beds) and a
teacher training college have recently been established and are at pre-
sent the two largest power consumers. A new post office and telephone
exchange are nearing completion.
21.       Future expansion plans include the following:
(i) Passion fruit processing is expected to treble output by
1973 requiring an extra 80 kl;
(ii) tobacco factory extension, requiring an extra 50 kW in
1971;
(iii)  air traffic, which has doubled in the last 2-3 years,
could double again in the next 5 years;
(iv) the local Government Council expects to have a major
workshop in Goroka by 1975;
(v)  three new town areas are planned, one of 1,000 popula-
tion by 1972, another of the same size by 1975 and pos-
sibly e third of 2,0CO also by 1'75:
(vi) if present proposals to introduce a reticulated water
supply are implemented, a water pumping and a sewerage
pumping station tril1 be required;



ANNEX 12
Page 6 of 10 pages
(vii)  an abattoir is proposed, initially to supply only local
requirements but which could be expanded if the cattle
industry in the district develops as expected;
(viii)  increased hotel accommodation to meet the expected expan-
sion of tourism. The number of visitors has been growing
at about 26% per annum but this rate could increase if
present expectations are realized. According to one es-
timate the tourist traffic will reach 50,000 tourist
nights/year by 1971/72;
(ix) a new Government hostel, with an estimated load of 75 kW
in 1971, rising to 125 kZ in 1973;
(x)  extension of supply to another coffee factory in 1971,
requiring 200 kW, and to a neighboring mission in
1972 (50 k1J); and
(xi)  a new residential and co=mercial development is pro-
posed by one of the coffee companies, though the
timing is uncertain.
22.       Other possibilities include the establishment of a tea factory,
a vegetable canning factory, wool weaving, a brick factory, a gravel
crushing plant and a brewery.  If the present target of 75,000 head of
cattle in the Eastern Highlands district is achieved by 1976/77 further
secondary industries could develop.
ME. HAGEIJ
23.       Mt. Hagen is not at present part of the ELCOM system.  Power
supply is provided by a diesel station owned by the Administration but
operated by ELCOM staff. This center is scheduled to be taken over by
ELCOM together with a number of other minor centers. 1Mt. Hagen would
then be supplied by Upper  -amu hydro energy, if the Project proceeds.
24.       Mt. Hagen is the chief town of the Western Highlands district
and has been developing rapidly in recent years. The 1969 population
was estimated at about 4,300, including 800 expatriates. This compares
with figures of 3,315 and 551 respectively at the 1966 census.  Total
population has been growing therefore at about 9% per annum and non-in-
digenous population at over 13%. Electricity generation has grown much
more rapidly, though this partly reflects the very low starting base.
1963,/64 generation was 0.37 GWh, which rose to 1.8 Nh in 1968/69, re-
presenting an average annual growth rate of over 37%. Load restrictions
have been in force for some time so that these figures understate the
potential demand.

25.       The prosperity of the area is largely based on tea and coffee
production, though there is a small but developing pyrethrum industry
and passion fruit is another export crop which is becoming more impor-
tant. Tea growing is a relatively recent introduction but output is ex-
pected to expand rapidly to a projected value of $A 5.3 million by 1974/75
compared with the 1968/69 estimate of $A 0.1 million. Coffee production
is mainly by small holders but is processed in expatriate-owned factories.
1971/72 output is expected to be nearly double the 1967/68 level of about
6,000 tons and to rise at 7% per annum thereafter. As a result, Western
Highlands coffee production is expected in the early 1970's to exceed the
Eastern Highlands, at present the most important producing area.
26.       The improvement of road communications, particularly the com-
pletion of the Lae-,t. Hagen all weather road, has had a stimulating
effect on the local economy. The best index of this is the movement of
inward freight, which has been increasing at over 17% per annum. This
trend is expected to continue according to the UNDP Transport Survey,
which estimates 1975/76 inward freight at 8s,o00 tons, compared with 24,000
tons in 1967/68.
27.       The projected growth of the primary industries in the area is
likely to encourage further secondary industry development in Mt. Hagen.
Conditions are favorable. Land is plentiful. 525 acres have recently been
acquired for town extension and a further 1,200 acres near the airport at
Kagamuga, where 21 industrial sites have already been scheduled. Labor is
also plentiful and of good quality. Ecpected developments over the next
5-6 years include the establishnment of a passion fruit processing plant, 4
saw mills, a 300-bed hospital, hotel expansion to provide for the expected
big increase in tourism, as well as the extension of public power supply
to existing small industries and Government establishments.
28.        The expansion of tea production will create a major new poten-
tial power load. By 1975, it is estimated that there will be 10,000 acres
of European plantations plus a further 4,000 acres of small-holdings. Each
1,000 acres requires a factory with a power demand of about 250 kW. This
does not include power for tea drying, for which there could also be a de-
mand if the cost of power were sufficiently attractive.
29.       According to one estimate, demand could reach 3,600 kW by 1975/76
assuming tea factories take their supply from the public system. Anothei
estimate, which is less optimistic about the prospects of demand for tea
factories, gives a projection of 2,900 kWJ by 1976/77.

KUNDIAWA
30.       This is the chief town and headquarters of the Chimbu district
which is the most densely populated area in the Territory. According to
the June 1966 census (the latest figure available), the total population
of Kundiawa was about 1,600 including 130 expatriates.  The main local
product is coffee but the best available indicator of the town's economic
growth is the annual inward movement of freight to the area. According
to figures in the UNDP Transport Survey, it more than doubled between
1964 and 1967/68, rising from 2,700 tons to 5,670 tons, an average growth
rate of over 20% per annum.
31.       The town is on the main Lae-14t. Hagen road, which has given a
big boost to its development, and would also benefit from the proposed
new Madang-Highlands road.  Inward freight in 1970/71 is expected to be
nearly double the 1967/68 level and to double again by 1975/76 when it
should reach 22,000 tons. This would represent an average annual growth
rate over the period 1967/68 to 1975/76 of 18.5%.
32.       The town is not part of ELCO0I's present service area, but is
included in the small.er centers scheduled to be taken over from the
Administration. Public power supply is from one 65 kW and two 35 kW units.
Severe restrictions are in operation, most consumers having a limit of
850-1,000 watts, and the supply is available for only 120 hours per week.
It is hoped to be able to lift the restrictions and to connect additional
consumers once 3 new 100 kW sets now being installed come into operation.
33.       Owing to the inadequacy of the public supply, many small private
plants have been installed. The most important are 4 units with a total
capacity of 3L0 klW at the Co-operative Coffee Processing Factory. A 30 kW
set supplies a local motel and bakery and a 50 kW set is installed at the
main hotel.
34.       Extensive distribution construction is presently under way for
the connection of new consumers when the 300 kW of new capacity is com-
rmissioned. Prospective new loads, apart from those mentioned in the pre-
vious paragraph, include the vocational school, the primary school, and
adult education complex, workshop of the Public Works Department and a
joinery workshop.  The load is expected to grow at least as quickly as that
of Goroka. ELCOM forecasts a maximum demand rising from 140 kW in 1970/71
to 520 kW in 1975/76 and 850 kW in 1977/78, but this does not include any
provision for connection of the Kundiawa coffee factory, which could add
another 120 kW to the load. Two smaller neighboring centers, Chuave and
Kerowabi~, ot present with their own supply, could also be connected over
the next few years if extension of facilities are justified. The estimated
load at these two centers is about 70-100 kW in 1970/71.

KAINANTU
35.       Kainantu is a small but rapidly developing town in the Eastern
Highlands district, favorably situated on the Lae-Mt. Hagen road about
130 miles from Lae.  The current population is note known but at June 1966
it was about 1,200, including some 120 expatriates. A town development
plan has recently been approved and many industrial and commercial plots
have already been taken up. Coffee is the main cash crop grown at pre-
sent but prospects are favorable for tea, cattle and forestry industries.
36.       Kainantu is not part of ELCOM's service area at present but is
scheduled to be taken over by ELCOM when supply is made available from the
proposed Ramu Project in July 1975. A small Administration diesel plant
presently serves a maximum demand of 20-30 kW.  The potential demand is
much higher because load restrictions have been in force for the last
3 years.
37.       At present there are about 15 private plants operating including
one of 170 kW at a coffee plantation.  The main and existing potential
loads are:
(i)  The Institute of Linguistics, which at present has 120
European and 20 local officer houses, as well as workshops
and a printing plant. Further extensions are planned. The
Institute has its own generating plant which is completely
inadequate for its needs. The present load is about 35 kW
but there are severe restrictions on the supply;
(ii)  the coffee factory, which will require another 100 kW in
the next 3 years. There are also potential coffee process-
ing loads within a '20 mile radius of Kainantu;
(iii) connection of other existing establishments generating their
own power at present. Precise details of these loads are
not available;
(iv) a high school for 500 boys planned for 1972;
(v)  a hospital complex which is to be developed as the main
medical training center for New Guinea;
(vi)  the proposed development of the cattle industry in the
area should lead to the introduction of associated se-
condary industries. An abattoir is already planned with-
in the next 5 years; and

(vii)  by 1975 it is expected that the first tea factory, with
an estimated load of 200 kW, will be established.
38.       ELCOV's forecast of the future load, -ssuming it takes over
supply and restrictions are removed, is as follows:

TERRITORY OF PAPUA AND NENT GUINEA
ELECTRICITY COJIISSION OF PAPIAA   NDI GUINEA
Alternative Projections of Electricity Generation
in the Upper Ramu Service Area
1.       Annex 12 sumnarizes the results of visits which were made to the
toiems which w,ould be supplied by the Project in order to check on the ELCOM
load forecast for the area. As a further check on the forecast, two other
projections have been made by regression analysisi/ of the relation between
the past trend of electricity generation in Papua and New Guinea and other
economic variables for which the necessary data were available. The vari-
ables used were monetized GNP (which was felt to be more relevant than total
GNP, since this includes the non-power consuming subsistence sector), the
value of manufacturing output and expatriate population. Annual Territory
figures for these variables (at constant prices for GNP and industrial out-
put) were obtained for the period 1963/64 (ILCOM's first year of operation)
to 1968/69.
2.       The data used for the regression analysis were as follows:
Year
ending    ELCOM Generation,   Monetized GNP,   Industrial Output,  Expatriate
June 30          GWh           $A Nillion        _A Million              lation

1965           66.o              1774.7              42.9            31,460
1966           78.1              191.9               49.6            34,669
1967           94.2              216.7               57.2            38,015
1968          110.0              243.3               66.o            40,363
1969          131.2              270.8               75.2            43,391
The trend annual growth rates derived for these variables over the six-year
period were 18.8% for electricity generation, 12.8% for GNP, 15.9% for in-
dustrial output and 8% for expatriate population.
3.       Two regressions were tested of generation on the other variables,
the firs-t taking monetized GN4P as the dependent variable and the second on
industrial output plus expatriate population as the dependent variables.  In
both cases the analysis show,red strong correlation between electricity
generation and the other variables, with correlation coefficients over 0.99,
and a high degree of statistical significance (i.e. very low probability
that the correlations shown could have occurred by chance). The following
regression equations were derived:
(1)  log ELectricity =  - 1.333 + 1.415 log GNP
(2)  log E ectricity =  - 0.686 + 0.674 log Industrial Output
+ 0.936 log Expatriate Population
The statistical calculations were done by Miss Shail Jain, Statistical
Services Division.



Page 2 of 3 pages
4.        Projected annual growth ratesi/ for the current five-year plan
(1968/69 - 1972/73) are 10% for monetized GNP, 16.5% for manufacturing
output and 6% for expatriate population. Assuming continuance of the
same growth rates in the subsequent five-year period, projections of
total electricity generation by ELCOM were obtained using the above
equations. Generation requirements in the Upper Raanu Service area were
then derived assuming continuation of the past trend in the relation
between total MJCOM generation and generation at ELCOM centers in the
Upper Ramu area. Finally, a third projection was made assuming 1977/78
Upper Ramu area generation would be 10% above the ELCOTH 1977/78 projection.
This was to allow for the possibility that growth rates of monetized GNP
and expatriate population might be appreciably above the values assumed
above, in viewi of the much higher rates achieved in 1969/70, according to
preliminary Government estimates (22% for GNP in real terms and 131 for
expatriate population), although there was undoubtedly a once-for-all
element in these attributable to the initiation of the big copper mining
development on Bougainville Island.
5,        The resulting projections of electricity generation in the Project
service area are shown below, together with the ELCOM forecast for compar-
ison:

6.        Equation (2) gave a better fit to the past data of electricity
generation than equation (1) and the alternative projection (2) above
was therefore adopted as representing the lower end of the range of
possibilities for the purpose of calculating the probable range of the
equalizing rate of discount (see Annex 18). It implies a growth rate
of 25.5%o in 171/72 falling to 17% in 1977/78, the comparable figures for
the ELCOTI forecast being 31% falling to 17.5%.  Alternative projection 3
(ELCOM + 10()), which is regarded as a reasonable estimate of the upper
limit of the range of possibilities, implies a growth rate of 31% in
1971/72 falling to 19.0% in 1977/78.

TERRITORY OF PAPUA AND NEIJ GUINEA
ELMTRICITY COMMISSION OF PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA
Economic Comparison of Project with Alternatives
Load Growth in Project Service Area
1.       The Project would supply six load centers in the Tri.st
Territory of New Guinea (population about 1.7 million) which are currently
supplied by independent plants, all diesel except for three small hydro
sets.  ELCOM is at present responsible for three of the centvrs, Lae,
Madang and Goroka, and is due to take over the remaining throe, Mt. Hagen,
Kainantu and Kundiawa. Lae (population over 24,000) and Mladc.ng (popula-
tion about 11,000) are the two main ports of the Trust Terrilory;  Goroka
(population about 8,000) is the center of the coffee growing industry
in the Highlands;  the other three towns, also inthe Highlan6ls, are
important centers of economic activity. Total electricity generation
in the existing three ELCOM centers nearly quadrupled betweelL 1963/64
and 1969/70, rising at an average annual rate of about 25% wILich reflected
the rapid rate of population growth and economic development in the
area during the period (see Annex 12).
2.       ELCOM provided forecasts of electricity generation uLp to 1977/78
for each of the load centers to be served by the Project, based on
projections of the underlying growth rates of existing loads, plus an
allowance for expected new loads.  The details are shown in J.nnex 10.
Towal generation is projected to increase from 54.0 GWdh in 1'70/71 to
278.8 Wh in 1977/78. This represents an average annual growrth rate
of 25.4.  The forecast increase is considered feasible in viow of the
excellent economic prospects of the service area. As a checl:, however,
alternative projections of electricity generation were made as described
in Annex 13. These alternative projections were taken into account in
comparing the Project with the least-cost alternative (paragraph 6
below).
Alternatives to the Project
3.       The alternative to the Project would be a thermal development
or different hydro development. Over the past seven years, she Common-
wealth Department of Works, acting as consultants to EICO4, have studied
the relative merits of the various possibilities. The thermul develop-
ments considered were continued local generation by diesel sizts, a
central diesel station (at Lae) to serve all the load centers, a central
gas turbine station and a central steam station (also at Lae). The central

gas turbine was ruled out at an early stage on the grounds of unsuita-
bility for base load generation and the lack of accessible and economic
gas supplies. The consultants' comparison of the other three alterna-
tives showed that expansion of local diesel generation would 3how
savings in capital costs but that these would be more than ofEset by
the much higher running costs, owing to the high cost of diesDl fuel
(ranging from $A 27040/ton in Lae to $A 110/ton at Mt. Hagen). A
central diesel station would have higher capital costs than a central
steam station and also higher running costs.
4.       The consultants also considered the alternatives of a single-
stage development of the whole of the Upper Ramu potential (i.e. 275 MI
plus the storage dam), of building Ramu Station 2 (180 NWT) first or of
utilizing a regulated flow of 900 cusecs instead of the 750 casecs
proposed. Their studies showed that in all cases the Project was to be
preferred on economic grounds.l/
Comparison with Least-Cost Thermal Development
5.       The Project was therefore compared with the best alternative
thermal development based on a central steam station at Lae using
imported residual fuel oil. The hydro scheme has higher capital costs
but much lower running costs. The comparison was carried out on a
discounted cash flow basis over a period of 50 years, representing the
average life of the hydro facilities. The main variables affecting the
comparison are the forecast load growth, the capital costs of each
alternative and the price of residual fuel oil. Values for these
variables were provided by ELCON but, in order to allow for the uncer-
tainties, probability analysis was used to establish the expected value
of the equalizing discount rate, and its range of variation, allowing
for different values for the main variables with associated rrobabilities,
as described below:
Load Growth
6.       Three different projections were used in the analysis viz.:  the
ELCOM forecast and the two alternative projections describec in Annex 13.
A probability of 0.6 was assigned to the ELCOM forecast, 0.2 to the lower
alternative projection derived from regression of sales on irdustrial
output and expatriate population and 0.2 to the higher alterrative
projection obtained by assuming that the load in the last ye r of the
forecast period (1977/78) would be 10% above the ELCCM figure.
Capital Costs
7.       Three different values were used for hydro and stearn station
costs as follows:
1/ They used a test discount rate of 8% but higher rates do jlot affect
the outcome.

(b) a lower estimate, based on 3/% annual escalation of
costs after 1970 - probability 0.2; and
(c) a higher estimate, based on costs 5% above the
central estimate - probability 0.2.
Oil Price
8.        The consultants had assumed a delivered price of $k 18/long tonl/
for residual fuel oil, based on recent trends in the area, bat for the
purpose of the probability analysis a higher and a lower pri3e were allowed
for as follows:
(a)  $A 18/ton    -    probability 0.6
(b)  $A 20/ton    -    probability 0.25
(c)  $A 15/ton    -    probability 0.15
Results of Probability Analysis
9.        Combination of the three different assumptions on :apital costs
and load growth gave rise to nine different cost streams for the Project,
with probabilities ranging from 0.04 to 0.36; these had to bv compared
with twenty-seven possible cost streams for the thermal alternative (with
probabilities from 0.006 to 0.216), since in this case the t2ree different
oil price assumptions had also to be allowed for. The results of the
probability analysis were as follows, writing (R) for the eqializing
discount rate:
Mean value of (R)                    17.6
Standard deviation of (R)             2.5
Range of (R) (95% probability)    12.6 - 22.6
10.       On the assumptions adopted, therefore, which repre3ent a real-
istic assessment of the possible range of values of the main variables,
the mean expected value of the equalizing discount rate is 17.6%, rwith
an upper limit of 22.65, and a lower limit of 12.6H.  This is satisfactory,
since the opportunity cost of capital in the Territory for lIw risk proj-
ects is believed to be around 12%.
1/ This compares with a current figure of $A 19/ton for a similar instal-
lation at Darwin (Australia).

Upper Ramu Hydroelectric Development (Phase 1)
Hyrdrology
1.        Investigations made by the Commonwealth Department of Works
were reviewed by the Snowy WIountains Authority using mathematical rainfall-
runoff models. This involved the establishment of a relatio!iship between
stream flow and rainfall of the catchment using a common peri.od of record
(1959-1965) and then estimating stream flow back to the year 1938 when
the earliest rainfall records from within the catchment co=mmnced.
2.        The Upper Ramu catchment is 340 sq miles at the gauLging station
near the intake. Because of the favorable climate and the comparatively
extensive meteorological and stream flowi records available, ihe catch-
ment is particularly suitable for the application of a wiater balance model.
3.        Rainfall is fairly regular throughout the year and there is
relatively small variation in evapotranspiration.
4.        The weekly runoff results obtained from the model compared well
with actual recorded stream flows, thus allowing extrapolati n back to
1938.
5.        Thus using rainfall data and average evapotranspirition, the
weekly discharges were reconstructed for the period 1938-1953. The
results obtained showed a very dry period in 1938, another i, 1941, and
a third in 1956 -which were lower than any experienced during the period
of record (1958-1965).
6.        The lowest average weekly flows, 1938-1965, are listed below:

7.        Although at first Bight the agreement between reco:'ded and
estimated figures is not close, this can often be explained ')y dif-
ferences in the time of occurrence of the minimum weekly flouls. For
example, while the lowest recorded weekly flow in 1965, 206 :usecs,
was in the 47th week, the lowest estimated flow, 157 cusecs, occurred
in the 48th week when the recorded flow had risen to 446 cusI3cs, pre-
sumably as a result of rainfall not recorded at the rainfall gauge.
The main reason for such discrepancies is probably the varia)ility of
rainfall over the catchment area and the fact that there was only one
rain gauge available for extending the flow records.
Flow Duration
8.        The estimated weekly runoff was converted into a daration
curve of daily flows and combined with the flow duration curie of the
period of record. The results are as follows:

Frequency Analysis
9.        The lowiest average weekly flows in each year were arranged in
ascending order of magnitude and plotted on logarithmic probalility
paper for each of the following periods:
1957-1965 (recorded flows)
1957-1965 (estimated flows)
1938-1965 (estimated flows)
As would be expected the estimated flows for 1958-1965 are lowrer than
the recorded values, A second estimate was therefore made by assuming
that the probabilities of occurrence of corresponding flows iii the series
of estimated and recorded data are the same for both the shor.o- and
long-tern relationships. The results are given below:

50            120                    165
10.       In general, therefore, the estimates made on the basis of the
model study coincide closely with the data utilized by the coasultants
to design the scheme, which are summarized below:
(a) Unregulated Flow. At the point of diversion the Ranu River
had a recorded low flow of 204 cusecs, a recorded average
flow of 1,100 cusecs, and a maximum recorded flow oC 16,000
cusecs. In the last 25 years, the flow could have been as
low as 150 cusecs, and in the long-term, the flow available
95% of the time could be about 275 cusecs, a figure below
recorded and estimated flow.
With a pondage to even out water demands arising from daily
load fluctuations, a constant river flow of at least 275
cusecs would satisfy a system load demand of 20 161, based
on a daily load factor of 70%.
(b) Regulated Flow, To increase the flow available stcrage is
required. A storage of 205,000 acre ft, of which 270,000
acre ft would be available for regulation could prcvide a
constant flow of 750 cusecs required to generate 6C IMiW at
609o annual load factor.

(c) Flood Flow. It has been estimated that the possiblf maxijmii
flood, based on a thunderstorm over 200 sq miles of the 345
sq mile catchment area using the extreme mean sea I vel dew
point at Madang applied to the catchment at 5,800 f1,, is
about 150,000 cusecs.  This magnitude was taken into' account
in the location of works, and their estimated cost.

Upper Ramu _ydroelectric DevelopTment (Phase 1)
Geology
1.        Geological investigations were carried out between 1958 and
1967 covering mapping, geophysical surveys, drilling, costeawdng,
sluicing and the recording of seismic events in the area.
2.        The scheme is located at the northern end of the A?ona Valley)
which is at a level of 4,200 ft above sea level and flanked 'y hills to
6,000 ft. The valley floor is composed of recent unconsolidited lake
sediments - the Kainantu Beds - which overlie a thick sequenme of meta-
sediments called the Omaura Greywacke. These in turn overli 3 schists
of the Bena Bena Formation. All rocks older than the Kainanbu Beds have
been cut by numerous minor basic intrusions. The undergrouni excavations
for the Ramu Scheme wEill probably be entirely in the Omaura Ireywacke,
much of it, however, in a thick marble bed.
3.        The Bena Bena Formation consists of mica schists thich are
extensively folded and silicified. Although foliated they are strong.
The Cmaura Greywacke consists of a lower marble lens up to at least
400 ft thick in places, overlain by a thick sequence of slightly meta-
morphosed siltstone-greywacke and shale, with a predominancE of shale
just over the marble. The marble is massive and strong neaI the surface;
eaves have developed in it.  The greywacke-siltstone and shble are hard
and strong; the two rock types are essentially similar but (dffer in
grain size. The Kainantu Beds consist of a basic conglomer~-te which is
overlain by a succession of silts and clays.
4.        The Cmaura Greywiacke in the area of the project i; folded
into a broad anticline wTith its axis plunging to the south east. At
the intake end of the project the rock dips south and at the outlet
portal north east. All rocks of the unit are jointed. Lineations on
aerial photographs suggest several faults through the tunneL line but
these could not be confirmed on the ground. Fault zones arz expected
to be narrow; rock within the zones crushed and weak. The Jreywacke
has been indurated by the heat of the intrusive basic dykes.
5.        Groundwater has been located in drill holes at ab,ut the level
of fresh bedrock.  In the marble no large cavities have beea located at
the site of the Scheme.
6.        Testing of the engineering properties of the rocks have shown
ample strength in the greywacke-siltstone and the marble for any under-
ground excavation. Both rocks would be suitable for concrete agg:;egate.



ANNEX 21
Page 2 Df 3 pages
Diversion Weir Site
7.        The siltstone-greywacke and shale in the river bed at the site
strike normal to the proposed weir axis. There are several iseathered
dykes in the bed of the river and a shear zone in the right lank. Over-
burden in the left bank is unstable and care will have to be taken in
treating these areas. The pond created by the weir will extend about
s mile upstream. The water will be contained by fresh meta-eediiaents
and there should be no leakage.
Control Buildinand Transforrmer Yard
8.        These, to the right of the weir, will be underlain by slightly
to moderately weathered siltstone-greytfacke and shale, strik .ng norrmal
to the hill side. Some stabilization of the slope above the transformer
yard will be necessary. The step-up substation will be buill, on Kainantu
Beds. The access road to the surface works will cross several areas
affected by landslips and will be partly constructed on KainLntu Beds.
Careful control of drainage will be required.
Access and Pressure Shaft
9.        The first 600 ft of the shafts will be excavated i1i jointed
siltstone-greywacke and shale. From 600 ft to the machine hall level
the shafts will be in marble. Water inflows are expected to be low and
lining of the access shaft should be largely restricted to t:ie first
100 ft0
Machine Hall
10.       The machine hall will be excavated in a uniform mass of rock
which will be mostly marble,  Some siltstone may be found bub this will
not affect the strength of the rock mass, Several narrow faults are
expected, but water inflows should be low and support restrizted mainly
to rock-bolting. The exact location of the machine hall can be deter-
mined once the tailrace tunnel and the shafts have been excavated.
Tailrace Tunnel
11.       The tailrace tunnel will be excavated almost completely in
marble; folding and faulting may bring some siltstone and/oz schists to
tunnel level. Several faults are expected but they should le narrow.
The marble has low to moderate fracture permeability. Becar se of the
capping of siltstone-greywacke and shale, which has a low pErmeability,
water inflows are expected to be low; however local rupture,. of the cap
rock or interconnections with near-surface marble could resilt in high
inflows. Most of the tunnel could be unlined.

Seismicity
12.       The Scheme lies in an area with a high incidence of earthquake
shocks. Between 1961 and 1965 nineteen shocks of magnitude greater than
5.0 (Richter) have been recorded in the area; intensities were up to VII
on the modified Mercalli Scale. (Richter Scale indicates the energy re-
lease at the epicenter, and the modified Mercalli Scale the intensity
felt at any particular locality.) It is considered that while surface
instability caused by earthquake movement is unlikely to end&nger the
operation of the underground scheme, it will have to be sericusly con-
sidered in the protection of surface works and access roads.
Drilling
13.       A total of 11 holes were drilled, 3 to the level oJ the machine
hall and one to the level of the tailrace tunnel about 3,000 ft dowm-
stream from the machine hall. Pressure testing failed to reveal evidence
of substantial water movement in the machine hall area or on the tunnel
line. Nevertheless, as a precaution against possible hydro--tattic pres-
sure, feeler holes will be drilled at least 50 ft ahead of thle face.
Construction Materials
14.       Four sources of materials are available:
(i) Spoil from the tunnel, shaft and machine hall excavration;
(ii) river gravel and sand;
(iii)  quarried marble; and
(iv) quarried gabbro and associated intrusive rocks.
