OIL PALM AND RUBBER CONSOLIDATION PROJECT
(Loan 2160-CM)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Oil Palm and
Rubber Consolidation project in Cameroon, for which Loan 2160-CM in the
amount equivalent to US$ 50.8 million was approved on May 27, 1982. The Loan
was closed on January 9, 1989, about six months behind schedule. At closing
US$16 million was canceled.
The Preface, Evaluation Summary and Parts I and III of the PCR were
prepared by the Agriculture Operations Division of the Occidental and Central
Africa Department  of the Africa Regional  Office.   The two beneficiary
companies had prepared PCRs, in conformity to the old model, which did not
adequately reflect all the points raised in the Guidelines to the new format.
Part II, therefore, contains a summary of their main conclusions with respect
to the project drawn from the material received.
Preparation of the PCR was done at Bank headquarters over a year
after the project was completed.   It is based,  inter alia, on the Staff
Appraisal Report and associated working papers; the loan and project
Agreements; the "Contrat Plan" for CAMDEV and associated working papers;
supervision reports; interviews with the last Task Manager of the project;
correspondence between the Bank and Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.
The draft PCR was sent to the co-financiers (the EIB, CDC, and CCCE) in
June 1990. However, no comments have been received.

OTL PALM AND RUBBER CONSOLIDATION PROJECT
(Loan 2160-CM)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Proiect Objectives
1.        Financial and managerial problems under preceding Bank-financed
projects in support of SOCAPALM and CAMDEV gave rise to the Oil Palm and
Rubber Consolidation Project which aimed to allow the two corporations to
complete development already initiated and consolidate their financial
positions.   Specifically,  they were to be given the means to bring to
maturity rubber and oil palm plantations, most of which had been established
under  the  previous  Bank-supported  projects.  complete  the  necessary
infrastructure and construct processing facilities needed to handle the
additional production.   Strengthening of management and continuation of
smallhol.der programs were other key components. During implementation, the
Government was required to review with the Bank its strategy for future
development of the oil palm and rubber subsector.  In this way, while the
project's short term goal was to safeguard the return on past investments, it
was also intended to serve as a vehicle for rational long-term planning.
(PCR para. 4)
Implementation Experience (PCR paras. 9-23)
2.        In spite of difficulties,  plantations   established under the
preceding projects were maintained and brought into production in accordance
with objectives.   Revised rubber tapping procedures permitted signific
economies in CAMDEV's replanting program,
3.        Implementation proceeded satisfactorily with SOCAPALM.  The CAMDEV
component had a late start due to management problemss introduction of a
"Contrat Plan' became a condition of disbursement for the CAMDEV component,
which was only met in December 1984. Disagreement between Cameroonians and
external financing agencies on the necessity of a management contract with an
expatriate agro-industrial firm was only resolved when, following significant
improvements under the Contrat Plan, the Cameroonian General Manager accepted
full  responsibility  for  its  implementation.    Although  ,etter managed,
SOCAPALM suffered from endemic labor shortages and the impact of the drought
in 1983. The crash in world prices of palm oil and rubber in 1986 together
with the strengthening of the CFA franc against the dollar wrecked the
precarious financial situation of both corporations.   Despite efforts to
increase productivity, financial health was never recovered. Actual project
costs of CFAF 30 billion were 732 of the CFAF 41 billion estimated at
appraisal.   The main reason was the reduction in the development cost of
CAMDEV, with a significant cut in its investment and operating expenditures
which amounted onily to 622 of appraisal figures.
4.        Smallholder programs were not coordinated among the companies
involved and suffered from a focus on planting targets rather than careful
selection of participants with the result that many plots were abandoned.
The development credit of FONADER (National Rural Development Fund) was
effectively distributed to farmers through the implementing public companies



- iv -
SOCAPALM and CAMDEV. Credit recovery was made directly by the parastatals
through 3tention of dues on farmers' sales proceeds.
S.        A consultant's report containing proposals for a subsector strategy
which involved expansion of production was rendered obsolete by the evolution
in world prices for rubber and palm oil. Government never formally adopted
a strategy but appears to be supporting greater exploitation of the domestic
market for palm oil and maintenance of existing plantations for both
commodities. This is a reasonable strategy under the present circumstances,
and the project has helped to execute it.
6.        Loan disbursements were particularly low in the early years and
only amounted to 70 percent of the planned amount over the life of the
project. Main causes were the strengthening of the dollar with respect to
the CFA franc in the first th'oe years of the project, and savings on the
CAMDEV  component  with  respect  to  field  establishment  costs.    Project
expenditure was also constrained by the participating organizations' limited
capacity to generate funds, which led to a shortfall in financing expected
from them of over 70 percent. Actual project costs of CFAF 29,968 million
(equivalent US$   ) were 732 of costs at appraisal, estimated at CFAF 41,000
million (US$152 million), inclusive of taxes.
Results (PCR paras. 29-29)
7.        Production targets (modified by the Contrat Plan in the case of
CAMDEV)  came  close  to  being  met.    In  addition,  management  of  both
organizations improved although there was still some reliance on expatriates
in key positions. However, financial results were far below expectations.
Almost 502 of project financing was intended to be provided by the two
companies which were also projected to become financially independent by the
early 1990s. Over the life of the project, SOCAPALM's self-generated funds
amounted to two-thirds of appraisal estimates and those of CAMDEV to only
30%, the situation being particularly critical in che last two years of the
project.   As costs were contained, this can be attributed to the drastic
downward movement in world prices of oil palm and rubber in association with
the falling value of the dollar vis-A-vis the CFA franc. Separate financial
analyses for oil palm (SOCAPALM; CAMDEV) and rubber (CAMDEV) show that even
though oil palm may be financially feasible with the prevailing protectionist
policy, it is not economically viable when border prices are applied, while
the financial rate of return for rubber is negative, given the overvalued CFA
franc. A simulation on rubber production, using a 40? devaluation of the CFA
franc to the dollar between 1986/87-1988/89 and a 5OX devaluation thereafter
to calculate the projected cash flows, reveals a positive rate of return of
around 8Z.
Findings and Lessons Learned
8.        Although major physical and organizational strengthening objectives
were largely met, the project was less successful in financial terms. Yet it
had been well supervised and, given external circumstances, it is not clear
how results could have been radically different. With their high debt/equity



v 
ratios, the companies were in no position to withstand the decline in
international commodity prices and the CFA franc exchange rate. A sounder
financial structure should have been put in place at the outset.   With
respect to future development, Government might now be more open to the
proposal,  originally  put  forward by financing    encies  at the time of
appraisal, to divide CAMDEV into separate units according to the crops
produced. This would make it more amenable to eventual privatization, if and
when prices recover and/or macro-economic decisions on the exchange rate
change.  The scope for management contracts (such as the one for CAMDEV's
bananas) should be explored with a view to encouraging equity participation
from the private sector.
9.        Main lessons learned from the project are:
(a) given the difficulty of accurately projecting commodity prices,
more attention should be given to consideration of alternative
financing plans, including debt versus equity financing;
(b) comprehensive structural and managerial reforms of complex
companies are best developed and implemented on the basis of
consensus between all parties concerned; adequate time should be
allowed for their introduction;
(c) projects aiming to develop financially viable enterprises should
cover all operations of the organization concerned; particular
attention should be paid to their financial structure;
(d)  ac it has proved difficult for parastatals, subject to Government
intervention, to operate successfully in a commercial environment,
autonomous management, preferably private management, should be
promoted;
(e) smallholder programs for the same crop run by different agro-
industrial enterprises should be coordinated; careful selection of
participants and identification of suitable land is more important
than meeting physical targets.

B.   Background
1.        Since the  late 1960s,  the World Bank has been assisting the
Government of Cameroon to diversify exports, which were heavily dependent on
coffee and cocoa, by promoting state-owned agro-industrial corporations
producing palm oil and rubber. The two supported under the present project
(SOCAPALM-Societe Camerounaise de Palmeraies and CAMDEV-Cameroon Development
Corporation) had each been the executing agencies of two previous Bank-
financed projects.
2.        The first phase projects for the two organizations, initiated in
the late 1960s, both focussed on oil palm and, despite cost overruns, were
considered successful not least because economic returns benefitted from
considerable increases in world prices. In 1975, second-phase projects for
both SOCAPALM (US$ 38.5 million) and CAMDEV (USS 39.3 million) were prepared.
At this point, national production of palm oil was 78,000 tons with 62X
produced in plantations and the rest from wild palm groves, while about
18,000 tons of rubber were produced with Government plantations accounting
for about 75Z. For CAMDEV, the emphasis shifted to rubber planting but both
projects aimed to extend planting and processing facilities with provision of
related infrastructure.   An innovation in the SOCAPALM II project was the
mounting of a smallholder oil palm program with the objective of spreading
the benefits of oil palm cultivation among a wider group.   A separate
division for smallholder management was also envisaged under CAMDEV II.
These components reflected a concern on the part of Government to pay closer
attention to the linkages between agro-industrial development and traditional
farming (PPAR No. 6019 of December 31, 1985).



- 2 -
3.        As the expected yields failed to materialize l,, costs increased,
alternative financing plans were not available and Government failed to
increase its participation in CAMDEV's and SOCAPALM's working capital, the
corporations faced severe financial shortages which further affected project
maintenance, yields and social com.ponents.  Poor management, especially in
the case of CAMDEV, aggravated the problems. Faced with this situation, the
Bank and cofinanciers CCCE and CDC were prompted to provide supplementary
financing in the form of the Oil Palm and Rubber Consolidation Project, which
is evaluated in this PCR, even before the two second-phase projects were
-ompleted.
C.   Proiect Obiectives and Description
4.        The project aimed to balance the current and expected deficits of
SOCAPALM and CAMDEV and improve a number of their administrative and
technical shortcomings. Specifically the enterprises were to be enabled to
bring to maturity rubber and oil palm plantations most of which had been
established  under  the  phase  II  projects,   complete  the  necessary
infrastructure and construct processing facilities needed to handle the
additional production. Strengthening of management and continuation of the
smallholder programs initiated under the preceding projects were additional
key components.   In view of the serious doubts raised about Cameroon's
comparative advantage in oil palm production and the uncertain prospects
facing rubber exports, it was agreed that SOCAPALM, CAMDEV and HEVECAM 2/
would not undertake any expansion of oil palm or rubber plantings beyond
those included in the project.  During implementation, the Government was
required to review with the Bank its strategy for future development of the
oil palm and rubber subsector. 3/
D.   Project Design and Organization
5.        Although SOCAPALM and CAMDEV are geographically and managerially
distinct, the conceptual foundation of the project was clear and understood
by all parties. The project as designed was oriented to the tree crop sub-
sector and allowed discussions with the Government on sectoral issue,, such
as production and marketing of palm oil, realization of a tree crop sector
study etc.  The fact that the two major companies in the tree crop sector
were included in a single project prompted the Government to resolve sectoral
problems affecting both companies.
6.        Given the deterioration of the financial situation under SOCAPALM
and CAMDEV II, project design should have paid more attention to preventing
1/   Due to poor clones and inefficient exploitation system for rubber and poor
quality field work and water deficit for oil palm.

the recurrence of a similar situation.  For example, the debt/equity ratio
could have been reduced through the injection of more capital.   While
improvements occurred at the start of the project due to some recapitaliza-
tion of the companies and provision of external finance, too much reliance
- s placed on potential self-generated funds  (the two corporations were
expected to provide almost half of total project costs and make substantial
progress towards financial independence).
7.        Management of both companies had long been acknowledged to be
unsatisfactory, although there had been some improvement under SOCAPALM's new
General  Manager.    In  the  case  of  CAMDEV,  the  phase  II  project  had
demonstrated the need for major reorganization. As a result, the new project
required the appointment of 5 expatriate managers in line positions.   A
reorganization study, commissioned under the project and done in 1983, found
that only 50. of estate managers and 302 of assistants were competent. This
underlined the fact that it was not simply a case of bringing in a few
expatriate managers in line positions to improve the situation.  The study
recommended a total overhaul of the company by contracting its management to
a private foreign firm. However, this recommendation was contested, as it
was politically unacceptable to implement such an unpopular reform.
8.        Because of the financial crisis affecting the preceding projects,
preparation appears to have been rushed. Perhaps understandably under the
circumstances, appraisal functioned as both preparation and appraisal, a
single mission giving rise to both an Issues Paper and the Appraisal Report,
although it was necessary to carry out a post nppraisal mission to supplement
data. While the short-circuiting of the project cycle may be justified in so
far as staff were familiar with the corporations and the project was in the
nature of a rescue operation, the result was a rather unimaginative project
with no innovative fiatures.
E.   Proiect Implementation
9.        Progress in project implementation with respect to the objectives
set at appraisal are given in Part III, Table 4. Essentially, plantations
established under the previous projects were maintained and brought into
production as planned and management at CAMDEV was significantly improved.
However,  both companies suffered from serious financial problems.   More
detailed information on project implementation is provided below.
10.       Disbursements of Loan 2160-CM are shown in Part III, Table 3.  The
particularly low levels in the early years is due to the delays in starting,
especially with respect to the CAMDEV component. The strengthening of the
dollar with respect to appraisal estimates permitted also some savings.
Total disbursement was only about 70Z of planned and the balance was
canceled. While the SOCAPALM component was almost totally exhausted (partly
due to an agreement by the Bank to finance the full foreign exchange cost of
the factory extension at Kienke), only about 60Z of the CAMDEV component was
disbursed. Major savings were made with respect to field establishment costs
due to the revised schedule for rubber replanting.   In addition, CAMDEV's
positive cash-flow in the beginning of the project allowed the company to
finance its operating expenditures without having to draw on the Loan's



-4
proceeds.
11.       As might be expected from the pattern of disbursements, proiect
expenditure (Part III. Table 5A) was lower than planned.    Actual project
costs of CFAF 30 billion were 73% of the CFAF 41 billion estimated costs at
appraisal. This was mainly due to the CAMDEV component where expenditure was
only about 62 percent of appraisal estimates and 75 percent of revised
(Contrat Plan) estimates.  Investment and operating cost estimates for CAMDEV
were cut down in its "peLformance plan".  In addition, CAMDEV's management
decided to finance part of its development program from own sources instead
of drawing on the Bank loan, considered too expensive.   While costs for
plantation  and  smallholder  development  were  significantly  lower  than
expected, those for civil works, equipment and vehicles were higher.  In CFA
francs, expenditure on SOCAPALM was greater than appraisal estimates with
costs of civil works (including construction of Dibombari Headquarters)
substantially in excess of planned amounts.
12.       Data on project financing  (Part III,  Table  5B) highlight the
serious shortfall in domestic funds of over 70 percent. The participating
organizations' capacity for generating funds was significantly less than
expected (Part III, Table 5C).
13.       Although the Loan Agreement was signed in July 1982, the Loan did
not become effective until one year later principally owing to problems
connected with CAMDEV.   In the interim, SOCAPALM was obliged to rely on
short-term bank overdrafts to cover day-to-day expenditures. The financial
situation improved somewhat when project financing commenced, although the
severe drought in 1983 was the main cause behind a significrant drop in
production and consequent deficit in self-generated funds in that year.
14.       The  fundamental  problem  affecting  operations  had  long  been
recognized  to be personnel  and its  low productivit'.   Because of the
remoteness of most of the estates, workers were for the most part recruited
from other provinces and turnover and absenteeism were high.   This was
aggravated by labor legislation in Cameroon which sanctions pro-rata
payments, with the result that a few hours work each day entitles a worker c.
an estate to participate in all the social facilities (housing, medical
etc.).    Because  there  has  been  no  substantial  change  in  prevailing
legislation, attempts to introduce incentive schemes for workers have had
little impact. On the other hand, the level of management improved under the
excellent cooperation between the General Manager and the Chairman of the
Board of SOCAPALM.  As a result the company was able to gradually recover
from the effects of the drought and improve its efficiency of both production
of FFB and extraction of oil (see Part III, Table 6 Project Results).
15.       The financial situation of SOCAPALM eased somewhat in 1984 after
the Government agreed to the company's proposal, supported by Bank
supervision missions, to raise the domestic price of palm oil 4/. However,
4/ Although the Government exchanged views with the Bank on methods for setting
producer prices, no mutually satisfactory method was agreed.



- 5 -
the positive trend was abruptly reversed in 1986 when prices of palm oil on
international markets crashed (almost 60% in real terms) at the same time
SOCAPALM's increased production and obligations under an agreement of
producers forced the company to export an increased quantity of crude oil.
Between 1984/85 and 1985/86 the quantity exported  increased by 352 but
receipts from exports actually declined by 20Z.  The situation was aggravated
by a price war among producers for the local market and the unrestricted
import  of refined vegetable oils.   The Government,  at that  stage,  was
unresponsive to requests to protect the domestic market via a system of
levies on imports and SOCAPALM had no interest in taking on another loan to
finance  refining  capacity.    Although  an  effort  was  made  to  increase
productivity by retiring less productive areas and minimizing maintenance
expenditure, the financial situation deteriorated further.

16.       In view of CAMDEV's serious management problems, conditions of loan
effectiveness  included  the  appointment  to  line  positions  of  five
internationally  recruited  specialists.   By May 1983,  four of the  five
specialists were in place and the Government and CAMDEV Board of Directors
had approved the report submitted by the consultant.   It was agreed that
recruitment of the fifth expert, the smallholder manager, could becc-e a
disbursement condition against the CAMDEV component so that the loan could
become effective. However, the situation at CAMDEV continued to deteriorate
and although the final disbursement condition was met in early 1984, the Bank
and other cofinanciers were reluctant to start fi:.anc,ng an organization
which was so poorly managed and inefficient. The Bank and the co-financiers
requested that a study be done on the reorganization of CAMDEV's management
and procedures.   As a result of high-level discussions between the Bank,
cofinanciers  and  Government,   agreement  to  submit  and  implement  a
comprehensive "Contrat Plan" incorporating the recommendations of the

consultant's report became the new condition for disbursement.
17.       From the point of view of the Bank and other cofinanciers, a key
element of the proposed reorganization was to be the replacement of
individually recruited experts by a team from an experienced agro-industrial
firm, under a management contract.   Despite Cameroonian opposition,  the
tender was issued but there was only one bid proposing a combined
SOFINCO/CDC team. It might have been adviss'c to reissue the tender at that
stage (particularly as CDC was one of the cofinanciers) in order to solicit
more bids. This was not done, the cofinanciers were enthusiastic about the
proposal but it was rejected by the Government, ostensibly on the grounds of
excessive cost.   Although the Contrat Plan was signed in December 1984,
permitting initiation of disbursements, the impasse over the management
contract was only broken in March 1986 when the consultants were persuaded to
withdraw their proposal and the General Manager of CAMDEV undertook full
responsibility for implementation of the Contrat Plan. In fact, under the
Contrat Plan, significant improvements were made to management and most of
the objectives achieved.
18.       The financial situation of CAMDEV was adversely affected first by
the late start of the project and subsequently by similar factors to those
affecting the performance of SOCAPALM.   CAMDEV was even more dependent on
export revenue than the other company and although world rubber prices did
not decline as steeply as those for oil palm, the trend was similar. Losses
were also made on tea and bananas, crops which were not included in the
project although they formed an integral part of CAMDEV operations.

19.       In 1983 the tapping policy promoted by the expatriate Rubber
Manager was criticized as being exhaustive of bark reserves and quite
inappropriate in the light of the financial situation which required their
conservation. A new package of tapping recommendations was introduced and
the whole replanting program revised, in some areas replanting being
postponed by as much as ten years.
20.       In a move not foreseen at appraisal,  on the job training was
carried out by a training officer recruited specifically for that purpose.
General training in management was later undertaken by another CAMDEV staff
member, who was designated Management Development and Training Manager.
Management personnel in the rubber and oil palm units benefitted from
overseas studies. Overall, the training program, particularly in rubber, was



-7-
successful.
21.       Smallholder  Programs  5/  differed  among  the  three  companies
involved: SOCAPALM, CAMDEV and HEVECAM (under a separate project).   There
were different policies with regard to respective obligations of the company
and the smallholder, valuation of labor (used to calculate the bonus paid by
FONADER-Fonds National de Developpement Rural), and even producer prices. The
differences were the result of adaptation to local circumstances and
technical reasons, such as land preparation techniques. SOCAPALM achieved
100Z of its oil palm smallholder program while CAMDEV achieved 402 of the
rubber program and 52Z of the oil palm program. Problems with CAMDEV were
that often its smallholders were dispersed on physically unsuitable land
(farmers giving priority to food crop ir. this area) with difficult access.
As a result some planted areas (10-15U.         in poor physical condition and
were subsequently neglected.
22.       FONADER,  responsible  for           J _r  the  necessary  credit  to
smallholders under the programs,  cont arctid operations  to SOCAPALM and
CAMDEV. While it might have been appropriate for the technical organizations
to handle payments to producers and supply of inputs on receipt of funding
from FONADER, the latter should have been fully in charge of credit recovery.
However, given FONADER's inefficiency elsewhere in Cameroon, the system
adopted was probably more effective.  Over four years, credit recovery by
SOCAPALM averaged 73.52 although it was lower at CAMDEV, with less than 50Z.
This is a relatively good recovery rate by African standards in agricultural
credit projects. There is also some evidence of willful delinquency
encouraged by lack of sanctions for non-payment.
23.       A consultant's report on strategy for the oil palm and rubber
subsector, presented in late 1985, which recommended expansion of production
of both crops, was soon rendered obsolete by the evolution in world prices.
A formal strategy for the subsector has not since been adopted by Government,
although there appears to be a tacit understanding to maintain existing agro-
industrial plantations and exploit more fully the domestic market for oil
palm by developing a domestic reftning capacity. In the circumstances, this
appears to be a reasonable strategy from an economic, financial, and social
point of view.   It could be improved upon by sales of assets or even
contracting out of management to the private sector.
F.   Proiect Results
Direct Benefits
24.       Production performance with respect to targets is given in the
table on Direct Benefits in Part III. Actual production of rubber and oil by
CAMDEV came very close to estimates made under the Contrat Plan (although
somewhat lower than original appraisal estimates) underlining the commitment
5/   The conclusions of this section draw heavily on the analysis in the "Note
sur le ddveloppement des plantations villageoises au Cameroun", May 1986, to be
found in Project Files.

of personnel to achieving those objectives.  Yields of FFB varied enormously
among CAMDEV's different estates from 5 to 15 t/ha supporting the policy of
discontinuing  production  in the  less productive  areas.    Rubber yields
averaging about 1,200 kg/ha at project completion, were significantly below
appraisal estimates but this may be due to the age distribution of trees in
production.
25.       After overcoming the effects of the 1983 drought, which affected
all plantations, actual production of FFB and palm oil at SOCAPALM increased
to exceed appraisal estimates in 1986/87. Yields in the last two years of
the project were equivalent to estimates of peak production made at
appraisal.
26.       Planting and production targets of the SOCAPALM snmallholder program
had been met by project completion but only about 45Z of the area planned for
smallholder production under CAMDEV had been planted. The project benefitted
1920 farmers in SOCAPALM and 450 in CAMDEV.
Economic/Financial Impact
27.       At appraisal the overall economic rate of return for the project
was estimated to be 12.4Z. It was not possible to recalculate the rate of
return on the same basis as at appraisal because there were neither data
distinguishing between enterprises such as first and second generation rubber
nor information on sunk investment costs.   However,  separate  financial
analyses on the incremental net benefit have been carried out for oil palm
(SOCAPALM; Table 6C(l)) and oil palm and rubber (CAMDEV; Tables 6C(2),(3)).
Except for the first couple of years in the case of SOCAPALM, the (financial)
cash flow for oil palm is positive throughout the period of study (up to
2007) for both companies (Tables 6C(l), (2)). This is principally due to the
protection of the domestic market and the resulting high local prices. The
same analysis, using export parity prices, would yield very different
results, with negative figures for most of the period. This shows that oil
palm production in Cameroon is not economically viable at prevailing world
prices. Rubber production at CAMDEV shows a financial rate of return of -14%
(Table 6C(3)).   The weakening of the dollar to the CFA franc eroded the
sector's competitiveness, with prices in CFA franc falling from 400-450/Kg in
1983-84 to under 300/Kg in 1989/90. The result was substantial negative net
flows for the CAMDEV rubber group when heavy investments were being
undertaken. In financial terms the project was a failure, although, as is
evident from the discussion under project implementation, major causes were
beyond the control of project management. A simulation based on a devalued
CFA franc from 1986/87 throughout the period of projection (presented in
Table 6C(4)), reveals a significantly different result with a rate of return
of 82. Differences between financial and economic returns suggest how much
of this is due to exchange rate over-valuation and other price distortions.
28.       Over the life of the project, self-generated funds averaged two-
thirds of appraisal estimates in the case of SOCAPALM and only 30Z in the
case of CAMDEV, the situation being particularly critical in the two final



- 9 -
years  of the project  6/.   Whereas  they were expected  to be close  to
financial independence by the early 1990s, thanks to support provided during
the project, the two institutions instead represent a heavy financial burden
which the Government ot Cameroon is in no position to support.
Other
29.       In the course of the project, personnel was cut at both companies
from about 20,000 which was considered to be close to the number required for
efficient operations. On the other hand, there are about 3,000 smallholders
which rely on the two companies to purchase their produce. These people have
benefitted from the employment opportunities provided by the project.
G.   Project Sustainability
30.       Without an improvement in world prices of the commodities produced
and an exchange rate devaluation, no net financial benefits will be realized.
Substantial external financial support is needed in order to sustain direct
benefits in terms of output. This has been negotiated in the framework of
new performance contracts for both organizations.
H.  Bank's Performance
31.       Bank performance was weakest in project preparation and design.
Little consideration was given to flexibility (for example in financing
plans) or to alternative approaches. By contrast, the project was closely
supervised, which permitted appropriate modification of project design and
achievement of some physical objectives. Key to supervision was continuity
of Bank staff, with an overlap of the two task managers involved.   In
retrospect, the following lessons may be learned from experience with the
project:
(a) the fact that a project is a follow-up to a preceding one does not
cbviate the need for careful preparation and design;   project
design should have taken alternative approaches into account,
particularly with respect to the smallholder program, and given the
difficulty of accurately projecting commodity prices, more
attention should be given to the consideration of alternative
scenarios (sensitivity analysis) even at the expense ef the level
of detail; this, in turn, should lead to a more flexibly designed
project which would permit prompter reaction to unexpected events;
(b)  adequate  time  should  be  allowed  for  the  introduction  of
comprehensive structural and managerial reforms into complex
companies, particularly when these are in the public sector and the
problems are long outstanding; project expenditure and activities
should be scheduled accordingly;
(c) external donors should not try to force management contracts with
6/ See table on Self-Generated Funds in Part III.



- 10 -
foreign firms on unwilling recipients but explore together with
local management and Government the scope for alternative means of
achieving the desired objectives (in the case of CAMDEV, close
involvement of all relevant parties in elaboration of the Contrat
Plan resulted in a mutually agreed program to which local
management was highly committed);
(d) a smallholder (outgrower) program for oil palm and rubber should
not focus on achievement of physical targets; instead particular
attention  should  be  paid  to  selection  of  participants,
identification of appropriate land (with respect to location,
physical characteristics and tenure), establishment of consistent
policy with respect to financing and prices and close supervision;
(e) as a smallholder program is a peripheral activity to a major
corporation  principally  concerned  with  running  industrial
plantations, commitment of top management should be sought prior to
establishment of the program, if this commitment appears weak, the
smallholder unit should be made as independent as possible.
(g) these commodities, especially rubber, appear to be economically
viable if well managed, but cannot be financially viable at the
present over-valued exchange rate.
I.   Borrower's Performance
32.       The Borrower complied promptly with the initial loan effectiveness
conditions by making substantial financial contributions to SOCAPALJ4 and
CAMDEV, which provided immediate relief to their critical financial
situations.    With  respect  to  senior  staff,  pension arrangements  were
improved. However, Government never submitted proposals to enable SOCAPALM
and CAMDEV to improve incentives, although it did support the managerial
reforms introduced in both institutions.   The situation with respect to
estate and factory workers was  less  satisfactory  as labor legislation
remained an obstacle to their effective use.  The Government also exacerbated
the problems of the two companies and other domestic producers of palm oil
when it failed to restrict imports of vegetable oils and to promote
development of a domestic refining capacity when export markets deteriorated
drastically.
33.       Management  problems were  a major  issue  for CAMDEV,  although
SOCAPALM was not immune. The lessons to be learned are those indicated under
(c) and (d) above, namely that any substantial reform of a large organization
takes time to implement and consensus is required from all parties involved.
J.   Project Relationships
34.       Bank-Borrower relationships were generally satisfactory apart from
the issue over the management contract which was eventually resolved. The
continuity and expertise of personnel on the supervision missions contributed
significantly to the good relationships with SOCAPALM and CAMDEV.   The



- 11 -
missions were carried out jointly with representatives of other main
cofinanciers (CCCE and CDC) and close contact was maintained between the
different  external  financing  agencies  throughout  the  project.    This
collaboration undoubtedly helped to resolve issues arising during the course
of project implementation.
K.   Consulting Services
35.       Foreign experts in line positions were a key element of managerial
reform at CAMDEV and the existing management structure at SOCAPALM. With a
few exceptions performance was satisfactory. Problems arose with a rubber
manager at CAMDEV and the manager of the smallholder program, who was
recruited with some delay and failed to satisfactorily reorient the program.
36.       All  rubber factory civil works and associated infrastructuv ,
except  factory machinery,  were constructed by CAMDEV's  own engineeL.ng
services and two local firms at lower cost than foreseen in project
estimates. SOCAPALM also took advantage of local firms. Factory equipment
was not always  satisfactory.   For example:   CAMDEV's  Idenau oil mill
constructed under the project was out of service for six months in 1987/88
for technical reasons while serious problems were experienced with the boiler
supplied to the extension of SOCAPALM's Kienke mill.
Proiect Documentation and Data
37.       The Staff Appraisal Report itself proved of limited use to the Bank
and Borrower during implementation, but the detailed working papers provided
valuable yardstick information against which to assess progress. In the case
of CAMDEV, the detailed papers accompanying the Contrat Plan replaced the
appraisal working papers.
38.       Supervision reports were the most valuable source of information
for the PCR, nonetheless use of indicators was inconsistent, for example in
December 1984 there was a switch from data on areas under the project to
production and yield information. There is no full set of annual reports or
audits  of  the  two  companies  available  at  Bank  headquarters.    While
information on loan disbursements was readily available, this was not the
case for data on total project costs, specifically, expenditure by the two
companies on the project did not figure separately in their accounts and had
to be derived from analysis of requests for reimbursement to financing
agencies. Part of the problem probably lies in the fact that the project did
not c'ncern the totality of operations of the two companies and it was
difficult to maintain separate accounts. When a project depends to such a
large extent on contributions by the recipient organizations, it may be
preferable to consider all operations as part of the project even if the Bank
is only financing some of them.

PART II. PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE 7/
39.       SOCAPALM considers that the project enabled it to complete the
developments initiated under SOCAPALM II. In spite of the unfavorable world
economic environment and other unforeseeable events like the drought, all
essential components of the project were carried out. Although accounts at
end-June 1988 showed a deficit of CFAF 2,733 billion, the company felt that
this should not be given undue weight since the accomplishments under the
project ha,' served to strengthen SOCAPALM's development potential.   The
company was optimistic that application of the new performance contract would
help improve the financial situation provided that the Government maintained
its obligations. In addition, the new sales strategy which emphasized the
domestic market rather than exports was expected to contribute to the
successful future of the company in the longer term.
40.       CAMDEV points out that the Loan was contracted to enable completion
of the CAMDEV II development program which had run out of funds.   It
considers that the project progressed satisfactorily to completion.
Nevertheless, the consistent and dramatic fall in commodity prices during and
after the project period, together with the financing agencies' policy of
reimbursing expenditure only upon presentation of claims 8,, drove the
corporation to finance investment operations initially with high interest
overdraft funds. The combined effect of the above, together with the impact
of debt service and loan repayments during the project period reduced the
working capital of CAMDEV from CFAF -26 million in June 1982 to CFAF -12,037
million in June 1988.   Because of the project, CAMDEV believes that if
commodity prices on world markets were to improve, it would be in a position
to earn substantial revenue. Local farmers and businessmen have benefitted
from the increased worker population in Kompina, Penda Mboko and Malende
areas, while local government has gained from taxes paid on employee earnings
as well as on sales of produce.
7/ The executing agencies prepared their PCRs according to the old format, their
conclusions with respect to the Project are general in nature and do not cover
all the points given in the Guidelines for preparation of Part II of the new
format.
8/  CAMDEV proposes that the financing agencies consider providing advances
towards the acquisition of specific and costly capital items.

Comments:   Accounts  of  the  two  companies  did not  reflect  expenditure  in
accordance with the categories indicated in the appraisal document. In order
to provide a basis for comparison of projected ard actual expenditure, the
latter has been derived from analysis of requests for reimbursement to the
financing agencies. In the case of SOCAPALM, discrepancies exist between the
figures so derived and those in the completion report prepared by the
organization, pending clarification, figures resulting from the analysis
(which  are  more  complete)  have  been  used.    The  revised  estimates  of
expenditure for CAMDEV date from establishment of the Contrat Plan in 1984.

Comments:   Results are for targets indicated in Appraisal Working Papers
which cover all rubber and oil palm production of SOCAPALM and CAMDEV. The
latter's targets were substantially revised under the Contrat Plan
established in late 1984 with the support of the Bank.

B. Economic Impact
Comments: The economic rate of return could not be calc-lated on the saiuie
basis as at appraisal, primarily because data were not kept for the different
estates of various crop enterprises  (first generation oil palm,  second
generation rubber etc.).   There was also no information on the previously
incurred investment costs which were taken into account in the appraisal
analysis for components supporting the bringing into production of already
planted areas (66Z of project costs).

C. Financial Impact
Financial
Rate of Return
SOCAPALM:  Oilpalm:      29X
CAMDEV:    Rubber:      -14?
Oilpalm:     232
In order to assess the financial impact of investments in the two
commodities, separate analyses were done on the incremental net benefit (i.e.
gross benefits' stream minus capital investment and operating costs net of
without-project net benefit) of oil palm production at SOCAPALM and oil palm
and rubber production at CAMDEV,  (see Table 6C(l), (2), (3)).  Investment
costs are net of plantation expenditure, which is reflected in production
costs, and the smallholder component for which supplementary information on
output was lacking. As the project was the third in support of CAMDEV and
SOCAPALM  and  essentially  concerned  with  consolidation  of  previous
investments, attribution of production is particularly difficult.   In the
absence of information to the contrary, production in the without project
situation has been assumed to be 25,000 tons and 22,500 tons of palm oil in
SOCAPALM and CAMDEV respectively and 10,000 tons of rubber at CAMDEV.
Oilpalm has a positive financial IRR of around 20X in both CAMDEV
and SOCAPALM (Tables 6C(2), (1)). This is largely due to the high prices of
oil in the protected domestic market. However, using border prices of CFAF
90/Kg instead of the CFAF 180/Kg included in the financial analysis, would
yield a negative return for CAMDEV and a much lower rate for SOCAPALM. This
is mainly due to low world prices which are below costs of production during
most of period under study.  This clearly indicates that oil palm production
in Cameroon is not economically viable.
Rubber production at CAMDEV shows a negative financial rate of
return of 14Z (Table 6C(3)). Overvaluation of the CFA vis-k-vis the dollar
has eroded the sector's competitiveness, with prices in CFA falling from 400-
450/kg in 1983-1984  to under 300/Kg in 1989/90.   The result has been
substantial negative net flows for the CAMDEV rubber group during a period
when heavy investments were being undertaken. However, a simulation using a
40? devaluation of the CFA franc to the dollar between 1986/87-1988/89 and a
50? devaluation thereafter, improves tremendously the cash flow and increases
the rate of return to 8? (Table 6C(4)).
