OIL PALM AND RUBBER CONSOLIDATION PROJECT
I. BACKGFROUND
A. Gene:-al
1.01      The United Republic of Camerocn is located on the Gulf of Guinea
in Central Africa. It extends northwards to the shores of Lake Chad and is
bounded by Nigeria to the West, by Chad and the Central African Republic to
the East aed by Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Congo to the South. Covering
475,000 km , the country embraces a wide range of climatic conditions, from
Sahelian in the extreme north to tropical rain forest in the south,
permitting a well diversified agricultural sector and near self--
sufficiency in food production.
1.02      The  country's  mineral   resources   are  being   increasingly
exploited. Oil production began in 1978. It is estimated to have reached
about 4 million tons of crude in 1981 and further increases are expected.
An oil refinery at Victoria, initially capable of producing 1.5 million
tons of refined products annually, came oa stream during 1981. An important
aluminum industry is located at Edea.   Other industrial development is
largely based on agriculture and forestry and involves domestic processing
of primary commodities, such as cocoa and palm kernels, and the conversion
of logs into lumber and paper products.
1.03      Infrastructure  developments  include  improvement  of the road
network, modernization and expansion of the railway system, expansion of
the port facilities at Douala and the creation of a new port at Rocher du
Loup between Kribi and Campo. The country is favored by a number of sites
suitable for the generation of hydroelectric power and the first major
installation has been created on the Sanaga river at Edea.
1.04      Cameroon's population growth i; expected to accelerate from the
current rate of about 2.4% per annum, and the total population will almost
double by the year 2000 and reach about 16 million inhabitants. Over 40%
is under 15 years of age.   Though 70% of the population is presently
engaged in the rural sector, the urban population is expected to reach
close to 50% by the year 2000.  Its exceptional growth has given rise to
shortages of housing and urban employment problems.   Since the agricul-
tural labor force is unlikely to rise significantly from its present level,
a substantial increase in agricultural productivity is called for if
urban food needs are to be met.



- 2 -
1.O05     During the Fourth Plan (1977-1981), GDP increased by 8.1% per
year compared with growth rates of about 4.5% during the two previous
plans.    Rapid  agricultural  expansion  and  high  export  prices helped
strengthen the balance of payments in 1976-78, and growing oil exports are
estimated to have been more than adequate to compensate for revenue losses
due to coffee and cocoa developments in the last few years. The overall
Treasury  situation  approached  equilibrium  in  1980.   It  should  still
improve during the Fifth Plan (1982-86) under the impact of oil production
and an increased investment rate sustained by adequate domestic and
national savings.
B. Agriculture
1.06      Cameroon's diversified agricultural sector is the mainstay of
the economy.   One-third2 of the country's  land area is classified as
agricultural (156,000 km  out of a total of 465,000 km ).  However, the
area actually under tillage at any one time is estimated to be only about 2
million ha or some 13% of this agricultural area.  Smallholder farming
predominates with about a million farm families contributing 93% of total
agricultural production, while plantation agriculture makes up the
remaining 7%.
1.07      The rural sector contributes about 30% of GNP, 50% of export
earnings and employs about three quarters of the total work force.  Per
capita incomes vary widely between regions. While they reach $160 in the
more favored parts of the southern forested zone, in the northern savannah
area they range only between about US$66 and US$90. These income dispari-
ties are a potential source of conflict since they tend to coincide with
ethnic boundaries.   Even in the more prosperous south, farmers wish to
reduce the transfer of resources to Government via the national produce
marketing board (ONCPB) which has historically paid farmers well below
world market prices for their export crops, principally coffee and cocoa.
Nevertheless, Government recognizes that in the long term, agricultural
development must remain the cornerstone of the country's economic
development. There is, therefore, concern at the accelerating rate of
migration of population from rural areas to the towns, especially among the
young, leading to rising urban unemployment and increasing labor shortages
in the agricultural sector.  In forward planning, increasing emphasis is
being put on improving living conditions in the rural areas by providing
better health and education services, and additional amenities, including
water supply and electrification.   This is linked to plans to increase
productivity of smallholding agriculture by raising standards of husbandry
and providing the credit necessary to permit adoption of more capital
intensive systems.  Principal constraints to the implementation of these
plans are shortages of extension service, weak institutions, inadequate
research, generally bad road infrastructure and poor supply and marketing
.arrangements.
1.08      Under  the  Fourth  Plan  (1977-81)  CFAF  133 billion  (US$493
million), or 13% of the Investment Budget, were allocated to rural
development.   However,  actual expenditures,  at CFAF 68.5 billion, are



running somewhat behind estimate, 51.5% over the first four years.  This
program is modest in comparison with agri2ulture's contribution to the GDP
(para 1.07).  Although 93% of agricultural production comes from small-
holdings, only 75% of current investment in agriculture is directed towards
benefitting small farmers. The remaining 25% is applied to expanding the
tree crop sector by investment in state-owned agro-industrial corporations
producing palm oil and rubber. Under the Fifth Plan (1982-1986), the share
of rural development is expected to be 24% of total investment.
1.09      Of the 39 projects financed by the Bank in Cameroon since lending
started in 1967, 18 have been in agriculture. Total commitments through
March 1982 amounted to about US$625 miLlion (Bank US$373 million, IDA
credits US$252 million).   The 1982-1986 lending program comprises only
IBRD funds since, in view of its favourable oil prospects, Cameroon has been
phased out of IDA financing. The number of projects proposed in 1982-86 is
25, compared with 22 in the period 1976-1980.
C. The Oilpalm and Rubber Sub-Sector
1.10      In  past,  agricultural  Bank  lending  emphasis was  placed  on
assisting Government to diversify exports, which were heavily dependent on
coffee and cocoa, by creating large industrial plantations of rubber and
oil palms.   These new estates also serve as nuclei for the economic
development of previously neglected, largely unpopulated, parts of the
country.  This program involved seven loans and three credits totalling
US$115.1 million:

With the completion of ongoing projects, the Bank will have
financed the creation of some 48,000 ha of industrial rubber and oil palm
plantations against appraisal targets of 50,000 ha, plus some 4,000 ha of
associated outgrower plantations. These three companies account for the
major part of the industrial tree crop area in Cameroon. Next in size is
Pamol (Unilever Group) with about 10,000 ha followed by SAFACAM (6,300 ha)
and SPFS (3,500 ha).
1.11      In line with Government's intention to involve smallholders in
tree crop projects, CAMDEV II and SOCAPALM II included plans for 3,000 ha
of smallholder oil palm and 1,000 ha of smallholder rubber, while in
HEVECAM II provision has been made for 250 ha of smallholder rubber
plantations.   These components are developed alongside estates so that
participating farmers benefit from the technical expertise of nucleus
organizations and from estate processing facilities.
1.12      Although Government has not yet formulated detailed tree crop
development proposals in Cameroon over the period of the Fifth Plan, various
broad strategic objectives have been proposed.  Recent policy statements
suggest that an increasing proportion of agricultural investment will be
allocated to develop the traditional sector and closer attention will be
paid to the linkages between agro-industrial and traditional farming.
This would tend to encourage the creation of rubber and oil palm small and
medium sized holdings in association with the existing plantations rather
than a continued rapid expansion of the estate sector.  Assurances have
been obtained at negotiations (para 9.01(a)) that no further expansion
would be undertaken by HEVECAM, SOCAPALM and CAMDEV during the project
period, while Government reviews with the Bank and other donor agencies, not
later than December 31, 1984, its proposed sub-sector strategy for the Sixth
Plan.
1.13      While long term prospects for natural rubber production look
encouraging, the situation with regard to palm oil is less favorable.
Large areas of oil palms in Malaysia, where much higher yields are
obtained, largely due to more favorable climatic conditions, put Cameroon
and most other African producers at a competitive disadvantage in world
markets. The prospects of further extensive oil palm developments in Asia
and Latin America suggest  that prices in real terms will continue to
decline.  It will therefore become increasingly difficult for Cameroon to
compete in world markets.  Palm oil production targets should probably be
geared to meet anticipated local demand plus whatever sales can be realized
to neighbouring countries within the UDEAC group. Because it is essential
that valid estimates be made of this future market, suitably qualified
consultants would be engaged to carry out a vegetable oil market study
to be financed under CAMDEV II (Loan 1508-CM). The study's recommendations
should be remitted to the Bank not later than March 31, 1983 for
review and before their implementation.   Government is already in the
process of recruiting consultants  for this study.   It also essential
that  appropriate  mechanisms  for  orderly  domestic  market  management
be determined to assure equitable treatment of producers and consumers.



This would be one of the elements to be discussed during the strategy
dialogue between Government and co-financiers (para 9.01(a).
D. The Institutions
1.14      Societe Camerounaise de Palmerzies (SOCAPALM)
SOCAPALM was established in 1968.   This corporation, with a
capital of CFAF 6.1 billion (US$22.6 million), has developed five oil palm
estates located in the Littoral and Southwest provinces, totalling 21,000
hectares of which 15,000 hectares (71% of the planted area) are now in
production.  The remaining 6,000 hectares would be brought into bearing
during the proposed project.   No additional planting would be included
under the project.   SOCAPALM investment;3 totalling CFAF 13,420 million
between 1970 and 1981 have been secured by equity contributions from
Government plus grants, and long-term borrowings from external sources
(FED, BEI, IBRD, CCCE). The Bank's contribution to-date amounts to US$34.6
million (para 1.10).
1.15      Cameroon Development Corporation (CAMDEV)
CAMDEV is a statutory corporation with a present capital of CFAF
4.6 billion (US$17.0 million) owned jointly by Government (78%) and the
National Produce Marketing Board (22%).  Created in 1946 as a one crop-
oriented estate company (banana), CAMDE"T began a long-term development
program in the 1960s based on rubber and oil palm as major crops. It now
has a planted area of over 39,000 hectares divided into eleven rubber
estates (21,000 ha), eight oil palm estates (16,000 ha), three tea estates
(1,200 ha), one banana- estate (800 ha) and 17 ha of pepper, all located in
the Southwest  province.   The  investment  program  totalling  CFAF  14.7
billion between 1967 and 1981 was finan:ed by self-generated funds and
long-term borrowings (FED, CCCE, CDC, IBRI), IDA). Bank Group contribution
to date amounts to US$33 million (para 1.10).
1.16      FONADER was established in 1973 and is until now, responsible
for organizing and supervising both rural development projects and
agricultural credit operations.  This inrolves:  (i) providing financial
assistance to farmers, individually or in groups; (ii) carrying out or
helping to carry out rural development projects; and (iii) guaranteeing
loans made by other credit institutions to individuals or groups in
agricuture and livestock.   FONADER is a separate legal and financial
entity, under the supervision of the Minister of Agriculture, but with
administrative autonomy.  It does not have its own capital base.  Its main
sources of financing are an annual goverrment subsidy, which in the past
came from surpluses accumulated by the cocoa and coffee stabilization
funds, and disbursements from external loans passed on as government
grants.  Since it has a limited staff, ii: has relied on other government
field services for supervision and execution, as well as for credit



- 6 -
assessment of projects. To provide FONADER with additional experience and
human resources, Government has requested the participation of FONADER in
credit operations involved in the Bank-assisted SOCAPALM II and CAMDEV II
projects in which credit funds for outgrowers are provided by Government
and passed on through FONADER; similar arrangements would continue during
the proposed project. FONADER's reorganization is presently under active
study.  Government intends to transform its present status of a parastatal
rural development body into a Rural Credit Bank with the objective of
distributing credits to farmers. For that reason, in the Project's small-
holders programs, the credit operations would be financed by FONADER
whereas the other smallholders' activities such as extension services and
road construction would be undertaken by SOCAPALM and CAMDEV respectively.
1.17      IRHO (Institut de Recherches pour les Huiles et Oleagineux).  A
French research institute which is well staffed and operates on an inter-
national scale, previously provided research, technical advice and oil
palm seed. Although the Cameroon station at Dibamba has now been taken
over by the National Research Organization DGRST, two IRHO scientists
remain under contracts with SOCAPALM and CAMDEV. These contracts would be
continued during the project period.
E.  Performance Under the Second SOCAPALM and CAMDEV
Projects and Financial Situation
SOCAPALM
1.18      The second SOCAPALM investment program (1977-82) included:  (a)
establishing the first phase of a new 6,000 hectares oil palm estate at
Kienke, maintaining these immature plantings and providing infrastructure
including the first phase of a processing factory; (b) establishing an
addLitional 1,000 ha of oil palm on M'Bongo estate, expanding the M'Bongo
processing mill and providing both M'Bongo and Eseka estates with
additional equipment and staff housing; (c) establishing 2,000 ha of
smallholder oil palm plantation under an outgrower program; and (d)
creating a common services center for a group of estate companies (Coastal
Estates Center (CEC)) in Douala.   Total estimated project costs of CFAF
9,464 million (US$38.5 million), were to be financed by an IBRD loan (US$25
million) and a Government contribution of US$13.5 million equivalent
passed on as equity (US$8.2 million), grant (US$0.6 million) and loan
(US$4.7 million).
1.19      Estimated cost to completion,  summarized below,  is shown in
detail in Working Files. As no agreement has yet been reached between the
CEC participants regarding a site for the construction of the center, it is
now doubtful that any expenditures will be incurred for the Douala complex
bef.ore the closing date  (para 3.07).   Excluding  this component,  cost
overrun on SOCAPALM II per hectare planted is expected to be 18%.

1.20      However, SOCAPALM's financial situation (Appendix Tables I.1 and
1.2) remains tight:  its cash position at June 30, 1981 was negative by
CFAF 275 million, (US$ 1.0 million), and irinus CFAF 1,100 million (US$4.0
million) at December 31, 1981. This situation stems from: (i) a lack of
self-generated funds due to yields that have been well below expectation
coupled with lower than forecast selling prices and (ii) lower than
expected production due to factory breakdowns and low productivity of
labor  (high  turn-over and  absenteeism).    Although  yields  from  still
partially immature plantations are expected to improve from the present
average of 8 tons of FFB per hectare to over 10 tons FFB/hectare by 1987,
average yields at full maturity will nevertheless remain below appraisal
estimates which were expected to peak at 15 tons FFB/ha.   They are not
expected to exceed 13.5 tons/ha in M'Bongo, 12 tons/ha in Dibombari and
Kienke, and 11 tons/ha in Eseka and Edea.  Measures have been taken to
improve the oil mill efficiency.  As for the labor situation, the rates of
turnover and absenteeism have been reduced over the past year and it is
expected that the situation will continue to improve as the underlying
problems come to be better understood as a result of further socio-ethno-
logical  studies  (para  3.11).    Thus,  in order  to  improve  SOCAPALM's
financial structure, the company's capital needs to be increased by CFAF
2,000 million (US$7.4 million).  Government has agreed to this increase and
this was confirmed during negotiations.   Actual deposit of CFAF 1,000
million would be a condition of effectiveness (para 9.02(a)), assurances
were obtained during negotiation that the second tranche of CFAF 1,000
million would be deposited before June 30, 1983 (para 9.01(b)).

CA_DEV
1.21      The investment program under the CAMDEV II project included the
following:   (a) clearing, planting and maintaining 7,900 ha of estate
rubber and 600 ha of estate oil palm; (b) planting about 1,000 ha each of
outgrower rubber and oil palm; (c) provision of technical specialists with
company-wide responsibilities; and (d) preparation of an expansion study
for CAMDEV and a master plan study for the region.
1.22      Expected  cost  to completion,  summarized below,  is  shown  in
detail in Working Files. The proposed Master plan will not be undertaken
as originally planned, as a similar Master Plan, performed under the
HEVECAM I Project, revealed that specific issue-oriented studies would be
more appropriate than preparing a global development plan.  Accordingly,
Government and the Bank agreed to carry out instead a vegetable oil
marketing study (para 1.13) and a reorganization study for CAMDEV
(para 1.24). The estate oil palm development has been reduced to half of
appraisal target because of labor shortages and poor quality of soils on
the west coast estate of Debundscha.  As for the outgrowers, the small-
hoLder unit was not established until January 1979 (PY2) and this delayed
start has been reflected in the planting program.

1.23      The investment program has beEn plagued by delays and, above
all, cost overruns, reflecting a general lack of cost-control at both
Headquarters and in the estates which was aggravated by various human and
structural weaknesses in the control process.  This situation has had a
direct repercussion on CAMDEV's financial situation (Appendix Tables 1.3
and I.4) which resulted in a deficit of C:FAF 937 million (US$3.5 million)
as of June 1981, and a deficit of CFAF 1,6)0 million US$5.9 million) as of
December 31, 1981.
1.24      Corrective  Measures.    Two  sEts  of  measures  are  required.
Firstly, in order to provide CAMDEV with ac.equate funds, a capital increase
of CFAF 6 billion (US$22.2 million) is required. Government has agre?d to
this increase and this was confirmed duriag negotiations.  Actual deposit
of a first tranche of CFAF 4,000 millicn (US$14.8 million) would be a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan (para 9.02(a)), and
assurances were obtained during negotiations that a second tranche of CFAF
1,000 million (US$3.7 million) would be paid-in not later than June 30,
1983 and a third tranche of CFAF 1,000 mi:llion (US$3.7 million) not later
than June 30, 1984 (para 9.01(b)); secondly, to strengthen CAMDEV's
management and reduce costs, the corporatiDn would (i) appoint for a period
of three years five internationally :-ecruited specialists to line
positions (para 3.17).  Their recruitment would be a condition of effecti-
veness (para 9.02(b)), and their actual assignment in the field would be a
condition of disbursement against the CAMDEV component (para 9.03(a)); and
(ii) engage an independent consultancy firm to advise on the reorgani-
zation  of  CAI4DEV's  management  structure  and  the  improvement  of  its
accounting system.   This study would be financed out of the CAMDEV II
Loan  1508-CM.   I't is expected  that the consultants' report would be
submitted to the Bank not later than September 30, 1982 for review,
and  that  implementation  of  the  agreed-upon  recoumendations  would
begin  five  months  thereafter.    Concerning  staff  incentives,  there
is at present insufficient flexibility in the salary structure to allow
for appropriate  rewards  for  outstanding  performance.    Moreover,  the
present pension benefits are inadequate; maximum monthly benefits amount
to CFAF 30,000 (US$110), equivalent to only 6% of the actual compensa-
tion (salary and fringe benefits) paid to estate managers.   Therefore,
assurances were obtained during negotiations that measures be studied
before December 31, 1983, concerning stafi incentives and that Government
would inform the Bank of any proposed measures to improve staff pension
systems (para 9.01(c).
1.25      A smallholder unit was created under the Second CAMDEV project
in January 1979, eighteen months after the project started. This unit is
experiencing a number of technical and managerial problems, and it
therefore requires to be strengthened including its extension staff and
delivery of inputs and cash grants to participants. Better attention would
be paid concerning criteria applied to select project participants. This
will avoid that plantations, are established on poor soils unlikely to give
the minimum yields required to ensure profitability, or farms located too
far from all-weather roads where crop collection would be difficult.
Accounts are badly kept and it is at present difficult to trace the amounts
of loans due by the farmers.   This situation should improve with the
assignment of the internationally recruiited smallholders specialist.

Moreover, with its future status as a Rural Credit Bank, FONADER will
finance credit to farmers from its own ressources whereas CAMDEV will be
directly responsible for the field supervision and roads upgrading (para
1.16).
II. THE PROJECT AREAS
A. SOCAPALM
Headquarters
2.01      SOCAPALM's headquarters are in Douala, and its five estates are
located within a 160 km radius of the port (Map 1). To avoid sky-rocketing
rent for accommodation and offices, the company proposes to relocate the
headquarters to Dibombari estate, 15 km north of Douala. The cost of this
new complex is justified and would be included in the project (para 3.07).
The two main estates to be assisted under the project are M'Bongo and
Kienke.
M'Bongo Estate
2.02      The estate is located 35 km southeast of Douala on flat or gently
undulating terrain.  Formerly under tropical rain forest the area carried a
heavy stand of timber. The free draining deep sedimentary sandy soils are
suitable for oil palms, but due to heavy leaching are low in nutrients.
Although rainfall averages 3,470 mm annually, it is poorly distributed and
the pronounced dry season sets a limit to production potential.   The
M'Bongo river provide adequate water for both domestic and industrial use.
The estate is connected by an all weather road to Douala, although this
requires  passage by  ferry  over  the Dibombari  river.   Production  is
presently sold either ex-factory, or in Douala.
Kienke Estate
2.03      Kienke estate is located in the southwest region, in the Lobe
river basin, at a distance of 244 km south of Douala, 10 km west of Niete
estaLte (HEVECAM)  and 10 km east of Kribi.   The  soils are typically
ferrallitic, derived from metamorphic rocks. The climate is equatorial,
hot and humid. There are four seasons, with two relatively dry and two wet
seasons annually. Seasonal moisture deficits may impose some limitations
on yield.
2.04      Kienke estate is linked to the main road connecting Kribi and
Ebolowa.  From Kribi, there is a northward link to Edea which provides
access to Douala and Yaounde. However, these roads are generally in poor
repair and are scheduled for upgrading, as provided for under the
Development Credit Agreement for the HEVECAM II project (Section 4.05).
The port of Kribi is not yet sufficiently equipped but a 2,000 tons storage
tank will be built under the project to enable exporting the future
plantation production (para 3.08).



- 11 -
Labor
2.05      Both estates are located in sparsely populated areas and are
heavily dependent on labor recruited from outside the region. Workers (at
present, 2,000 in M'Bongo and 1,000 in Kienke) come mainly from the south-
central and eastern provinces and further investments in social infra-
structure, to be continued during the pro ect, will be required to meet the
needs of resident laborers and their families. A bonus system was recently
introduced as an additional incentive to attract labor.   Nevertheless,
turn-over is still high, especially at the M'Bongo estate located near
Douala, as young unmarried workers are more attracted by the city life.
Recent measures, such as the improvement i.n statutory housing standards on
estates, have been expensive but have nct yet had the desired effect in
stabilizing labor or improving performance.   The labor problem is long
standing and deeply rooted in social attitudes and customs.  Prior to
independence, few Cameroonians displayed interest in paid employment and
in West Cameroon in particular, the estates relied heavily on immigrant
Nigerian workers.
B. CAMDEN'
2.06      The various estates involved ia the project have been planted
around the lower slopes of Mount Cameroon (for rubber) and along the west
coast (for oil palms) (Map No. 2). CAMDE'I's Head Office is at Bota, near
Victoria, and warehouses, main repair shops and hospital are centered a
short distance away in Tiko. Palm oil processing mills are at Idenau and
Mondoni; rubber processing facilities are at Tiko, Missellele, Meanja, and
Mukonje. The port facilities at Victoria and Tiko are used for exports of
palm oil and kernels whereas Douala hancdles CAMDEV's rubber and banana
exports and imported supplies.
2.07      Certain problems have proved more difficult than was anticipated
at appraisal: rocky soils in Tombel, steep land at MBonge, water-logging
at Mokoko and drainage problems in Penda-MBoko, all of which have contri-
buted to cost overruns on field operations and road establishment. A soil
surveyor has been appointed to undertakE detailed surveys necessary to
complete the remainder of the planting program.
2.08      All of the CAMDEV estates are located in the South-West Provincg
having a relatively low density of popuLation (25 inhabitants per km
compared with the Teighboring West Provirce which has a high rate of 75
inhabitants per km ). Plantation workers thus are mostly recruited from
the West and North West Provinces and there is practically no shortage
except in the coastal oil palm estates of ]:denau and Debundsha. Moreover,
CAMDEV's labor force, totalling 20,700 workers, is relatively stable and
turnover and absenteeism rates are low.  However, there is an imbalance
with a surplus of labor available for relatively unskilled tasks but a
shortage of skilled rubber tappers and oil palm harvesters. This problem
would have to be tackled during project implementation and should be
addressed by a combination of improved l:raining and better motivation
through appropriate incentive schemes.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Summary Description
3.01      The project would be implemented over a five-year period and
would consolidate investments which SOCAPALM and CAMDEV undertook during
previously Bank financed projects. It would bring to maturity rubber and
oil palm plantations, complete the necessary infrastructure and provide
processing facilities to handle the additional crop when the trees come
into bearing.   In addition, CAMDEV's rubber replanting program would be
supported.
3.02      Investments to be carried out by SOCAPALM would be:
a)   to maintain during the remaining period of immaturity and bring
into production 579 ha of young palms at M'Bongo and 5,112 ha at
Kienke -- total 5,691 ha -- all planted under the SOCAPALM II
project;
b)   to provide for administrative services, vehicles and equipment
related to these immature areas;
c)   to complete the housing and social infrastructure investment in
Kienke, M'Bongo and Dibombari estates required in support of the
young plantings;
d)   to double the capacity of the oil palm factories at Dibombari and
Kienke estates by the addition to each of a second 20 t/hr
processing line;
e)   to  construct  a  new  company  headquarters  at  Dibombari  and
additional storage capacity for 12,000 tons of palm oil;
f)   to provide management and staff training, soil survey and socio-
ethnological studies.
g)   to  provide  for  the  continuation  of  the  smallholder  scheme
initiated under SOCAPALM II; and
3.03      Investments to be carried out by CAMDEV would be:
a)        to maintain during the remaining period of immaturity and bring
into production 6,181 ha of young rubber planted under CAMDEV II project,
2,105 ha of young rubber planted on on-going estates and financed on self-
generated funds, 126 ha of young palms planted under CAMDEV II and 1,033 ha
of young oil palms planted. on on-going estates and financed with self-
generated funds;
b)        to plant, and maintain during the project period, 1,719 ha of
rubber to complete the CAMDEV II project;



- 13 -
c)        to replant 2,931 ha of old rubber and 500 ha of old oil palm
plantation with young rubber, and maintain those immature plantations
during the project period.
d)        to provide for administrative services related to these immature
areas;
e)        to  renew  vehicles  and  heavy  equipment,  extend  and,  where
necessary upgrade the road, water supply, staff and labor housing and
social infrastructure;
f)        to  provide  new  rubber  processing  facilities  at  Kompina,
Pendamboko, Malende, Tombel and MBonge, and equipment as required in the
company's other rubber and oil palm factories;
g)        to provide technical assistance to CAMDEV, including provision
for the training of Cameroonian staff and scholarships abroad; and
h)        to provide continuing support to the ongoing rubber and oil palm
smallholder programs initiated under CAMDEV ]I.
B. Detailed Features
SOCAPALM
3.04      The field establishment program detailed in Appendix Table III.1
is summarized below:
PYl       PY2        PY3        PY4        PY5       TOTAL
----hectares------------------
Upkeep and Maintenance        5,691     4,100      2,416        566        -       5,691
Brought into Production         -       1,591      1,684      1,850        566     5,691
All  land clearing and planting will be completed under  the on-going
SOCAPALM II project.  Thus, field costs would include only the upkeep and
maintenance of planted but still immature areas. Equipment and operating
costs would be only those related to the above immature areas.  Estates
general charges and headquarters overheads would be apportioned on a per
hectare basis.
3.05      Infrastructure for housing and social buildings would complete
the programs initiated under the SOCAPALM II project for Kienke, M'Bongo,
Dibombari estates. Two additional villages would be built in M'Bongo and
Kienke, as well as classrooms and shops, village electrification would
continue and water would be supplied in each estate village. At Kienke, a
dispensary would be provided to cover first aid and emergencies, but for
maternity and long term care, SOCAPALM woulc share the HEVECAM hospital
facilities financed under another Bank Loan/Credit located in the adjacent
Niete estate.



- 14 -
3.06      Factory Extensions
Financing was included in the SOCAPALM II project to expand the
M'Bongo factory capacity to 40 tons/hour. Construction would be completed
in FY 1981-82, as well as the first stage 20 tons/hour Kienke oil mill.
Under the proposed project, Kienke and Dibombari oil mills would each be
extended by the addition of a second 20 tons/hour processing line.  The
Dibombari extension would be financed by BEI.
3.0C7     Headquarters  in Dibombari.   The  transfer of SOCAPALM Head-
quarters to Dibombari received the Bank's apptoval in early 1979, on the
grounds that it would both improve the company's performance and reduce
overhead costs.   The investment was to be financed under SOCAPALM II
project but was contingent on the decision of the CEC members to build a
joint headquarters in Douala. Now it appears that CEC members do not wish
to establish a joint headquarters; therefore the transfer of SOCAPALM's
owII headquarters to Dibombari is now justified and would be financed under
the proposed  project.   This  investment is considered financially and
economically fully justified.
3.08      Oil Terminals.   Though the vegetable oils market study will
better assess the evolution of the local market, most of the incremental
production will be exported. SOCAPALM expects to export 10,000 tons (34%
of production) in 1981-82. Shipments have been made through Victoria which
proved very costly.  Financed by self-generated funds, construction of a
first phase storage capacity of 2,000 tons is underway.  As exports are
expected to increase, storage capacity at Douala as well as in Kribi needs
to be expanded. In Kribi, a 2,000 tons storage tank is projected to handle
the nearby Kienke estate production which would be more economically
shipped through Kribi than through Douala. Provisions have been made for
additional storage capacity; while the final decision on its size and
location will await detailed analysis of the Marketing study's recommenda-
tions, limited construction for the most urgently needed facilities at
Kribi and Douala would be undertaken immediately.
3.09      Smallholders
The smallholder scheme initiated under the SOCAPALM II project
would continue under the proposed project. The program and future planning
includes the following hectarage of oil palm smallholdings to be
maintained and brought into production:

Areas planted under SOCAPALM II (1,660 ha) would be brought to maturity
whereas those planted under the project would be maintained during the
project period.
3.10      Due to bad roads in Eseka and Edea districts, it is essential to
upgrade the present network. Two motor graders would be purchased, one for
each sector, and 65 kilometers of roads wou.d be upgraded and regularly
maintained.
3.11      Studies, Scholarships
As recommended in the master plan for future expansion and
diversification of crops, SOCAPALM would carry out a soil survey and prepa-
ratory study for a proposed coconut estate at Muanko. Another study would
further examine the important labor issue, as a follow-up to the various
studies already prepared in the past. These will be reviewed and a socio-
ethnological study is envisaged to focus oln the causes of high labor
turnover taking into account the experience of private plantations
operating in Cameroon and neighbouring countries. SOCAPALM's scholarship
program would continue during the project, specially for agronomists who
will be sent abroad (Ivory Coast and Malaysia) and for financial staff to
be trained by AFCA specialists who have already initiated a satisfactory
training of HEVECAM's accounting clerks.
CAMDEV
3.12      The field establishment program, detailed in Appendix Table III.2,
includes:



- 16 -
(i) upkeep, until maturity, of 8,286 ha immature rubber, of which
6,181 ha were planted under CAMDEV II and 2,105 ha from self
generated funds; about 4,759 ha of the total would enter into
production during the project;
(ii) upkeep, until maturity, of 1,159 ha immature oil palms of which
126 ha were planted under CAMDEV II and 1,033 from self generated
funds. All of these plantings would be brought into production
during the proposed project;
(iii) Under CAMDEV II about 7,900 ha rubber were intended to be
planted; however, some 1,719 ha would only be cleared but not yet
planted. This would be completed under the proposed project as
shown below:

TOTAL                         7,900           7,900
While land clearing, (felling) would be mechanical, as well as windrowing
to be undertaken with CAMDEV equipment, all other operations would be with
manual labor. Polybag planting materials would be available from existing
CAMDEV II nurseries, and planting would be at a density of 510 trees per
hectare;
(iv) about 2,931 ha of old rubber trees would be felled and replanted.
These plantations have low density of trees per hectare or lack
of tappable bark, and have become uneconomic; and
(v) on the existing oil palm estates, 500 hectares of old palms would
be replanted with rubber.
3.13      Administrative cost, vehicles, heavy equipment
The project costs would include the estates' general charges and
the Headquarters overheads related to project, supported immature areas,
and apportioned to them on a per hectare basis.   In the same way, only
vehicles and heavy equipment required for the completion of the above field
establishment program would be financed.

3.14      Factories
The processing facilities to be financed under the project would
be required to handle increased productioa. Incremental rubber production
would be processed by new units to be built at MBonge, Malende, Kompina,
Penda MBoko, and possibly Tombel.   Furthermore the existing Mondoni oil
mill and the Tiko and Mukonje rubber factories would be rehabilitated.
Increased palm oil production of the west coast estates would be processed
by a new oil mill to be built at Idenau and financed by CCCE and BEI.
3.15      Buildings, water supply, road rehabilitation
The completion of worker houses and related social buildings and
water supply in CAMDEV II estates would also be financed.  CAMDEV would
also need to rehabilitate villages and roads in other on-going estates for
immature as well as mature areas.   Particularly in mature areas, poor
condition of road network has led to a drop in production (estimated at 5%)
since  some  areas  are  totally  isolated during the rainy season.   The
inclusion of this component in the project would enable a better control
and planning of CAMDEV's rehabilitation efforts.
3.16      Smallholders program, initiated under CAMDEV II financing would
be continued and completed according to the following schedule:

The planting program would be flexible and could be modified to
give more emphasis to rubber for reasons outlined above.  The unit would be
reinforced by an internationally recruited smallholder's specialist and a
training program for the extension staff.  As for SOCAPALM smallholders'
program, project financing would include maintenance of the road network
linking various plantations with the main roads leading to the factories;
provisions would be made to upgrade yearly 350 km of secondary roads.

3.17      Management consultant team
CAMDEV needs to strengthen and to improve its management
performance (para 4.06).   Therefore,  for a transitory period of three
years, the following internationally recruited specialists would be put in
line  positions:    A  Deputy  General  Manager,  a Financial  Manager,  a
Management Controller, a Factory Engineer and a Manager of the small-
holders unit. These temporary recruited officers would be additional to
the present team of advisors whose responsibilities would also be
transformed  by  putting  them  into  line  positions  during  project
implementation.
3.18      Studies, scholarships
As for SOCAPALM, funds would be allocated to continue the
present scholarship program for agronomists and to initiate a training
program  for  financial  management  staff.    These  programs  would  be
established in accordance with the recommendation of a specific study to
determine the company's needs and priorities.
C. Project Costs
3.19      The total cost of the proposed project during the five-year
investment period is estimated at CFAF 41,000 million (US$152 million)
inclusive of all identifiable taxes. The foreign exchange component would
be 50% or CFAF 20,620 million (US$76.3 million).   Government intends to
forego import duties and levies on imported equipment; this was confirmed
during negotiations. Under this assumption, the tax element accounts for
CFAF 2,102 million (US$7.8 million) or 5% of total project costs, leaving a
net of tax total of CFAF 38,898 million (US$144.2 million).   Physical
contingencies have been estimated at 5% on all costs except salaries, and
price increases applied on baseline costs plus physical contingencies
compounded yearly as follows:
1981-82   1982-83   1983-84   1984-85   1985-86   1986-87
(i)    Fertilizers, chemicals
gasoline              12%        11.5%      11%       10%        10%        10%
(ii)   Other foreign
exchange               9%         81,%       8%        7%         7%         7%
(iii)  Local costs              12%       12%        12%        12%        12%       12%
Price contingencies for fertilizers, chemicals and gasoline are based on
projected price increases for petroleum products. Other foreign exchange
costs follow projected international inflation, and local cost increase is
linked to domestic inflation.   Cost estimates were based on March 1982
prices.   Total contingencies amount to 43% of the base costs or 30% of
total project costs. A summary of project cost estimates is given in Table
3.3 and a yearly breakdown by categories of expenditure is given in
Appendix Tables III.3, III.4, and III.5.

D. Proposed Financing
3.20      The proposed financing plan is given in Table 3.4.  The project
expenditure would be financed by (i) external sources of funds (US$76.3
million or 50% of total cost including taxes, and 53% of costs excluding
taxes); (ii) SOCAPALM and CAMDEV (US$71.2 million, or 47% of total costs
including taxes and 45% of costs excluding taxes); and (iii) Government
direct contribution to the smallholders programs (US$4.5 million, or 3% of
total costs including taxes, and 2% excluding taxes).
3.21      The Bank loan of US$50.8 million  (including the capitalized
front end fee) would be made to Government for a 20 years period including
5 years grace period and at the interest rate applicable at the time of
Board circulation. These terms are justified on country grounds. The Bank
loan would be deployed as follows:   US$16.3 million to cover 44.5% of
SOCAPALM's investment program, US$25.6 million representing 25% of
CAMDEV's investments and US$8.1 million or 64% of the smallholders scheme.
CDC London would lend Sterling 6.2 million or US$12.3 million to cover 12%
of CAMDEV's investment program. BEI, with the equivalent of US$6.6 million
would finance 100% of the extension of SOCAPALM's Dibombari oil mill
(US$4.1 million) and 100% of the upgrading of CAMDEV's Mondoni oil mill
(US$2.5 million). CCCE would lend FF 40 million or US$7.4 million to cover
7% of CAMDEV's investments.
It is expected that the long terna external financing would be
made to Government on the following conditions:
Loan                                     IBRD         CDC          BEI          CCCE

3.22      SOCAPALM and CAMDEV would finance local expenditures of US$16.3
million and US$54.9 million respectively representing 44.5% and 53% of
their project expenditures. These funds would come from Government capital
increases (US$29.6 million), Government and local medium term loans (US$
13.3 million) and self generated funds (US$28.3 million).

3.23      Government would contribute to 36% of the smallholders programs
(US$4.5 million).   This contribution would be in addition to required
equity increases for both SOCAPALM and CAMDEV: CFAF 2,000 million (US$7.4
million) for SOCAPALM and CFAF 6,000 million (US$22.2 million) for CAMDEV.
Moreover, assurances were obtained at negotiations (para 9.01(f)) that
Government would make two interest free medium term loans:   CFAF 1,000
million (US$3.7 million) to SOCAPALM, which would reimburse 50% in PY3 and
50% in PY4; and CFAF 2,000 million (US$7.4 million) to CAMDEV, which would
reimburse in PY5.   Also in view of strengthening SOCAPALM and CAMDEV
working capitals, Government intends to grant, for the project period, a
company-tax  exemption  for both  entities.   'This was  confirmed during
negotiations.
3.24      Effectiveness of the IBRD loan would be contingent upon the
Government's contracting loans with CDC, BEI and CCCE, or securing alter-
native satisfactory sources of finance, to cover the balance of project
costs (para 9.02(c)).   The IBRD loan would be granted to Government on
standard terms. Government would on-lend US$12.0 million to SOCAPALM and
US$21.9 million to CAMDEV on the same terms and conditions as the IBRD
loan.  So as to strengthen the two companies financial structure, US$8.0
million would be passed on as equity:   US$4.3 million for SOCAPALM and
US$3.7 million for CAMDEV.   The financing of the smallholders units'
administrative costs, extension services and road upgrading would be
passed on to the executing agencies on a grant basis: US$4.3 million to
SOCAPALM and US$3.8 million to CAMDEV. A condition of effectiveness would
be that separate satisfactory financing agreements have been signed by
Government with SOCAPALM and CAMDEV and become effective (para 9.02(d)).
Financial assistance and supervision of the smallholder programs would be
managed by SOCAPALM and CAMDEV under two Credit Administration Agreements
with FONADER acceptable to the Bank. The arrangements would be similar to
those implemented under the second SOCAPALM (Loan 1392-CM) and second
CAMDEV (Loan 1508-CM) projects. Disbursement against this component would
be conditional on the effectiveness of these agreements as well as the
effectiveness of a satisfactory financing agreement between Government and
FONADER (para 9.03(b).
E. Procurement
3.25      Apart from US$4.5 million for vehicles financed by CCCE, all
other goods and services would be procured under the Bank's procurement
guidelines.   Contracts of US$100,000 or more would be awarded through
international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  in  accordance  with  Bank
guidelines. These ICB would be launched by the Coastal Estate Center (CEC)
through the Government's Direction  Centrale  des Marches  (CCM)  as at
present. CEC regroups the needs of its five plantations members and prices
obtained are the lowest and control of procurement procedures has been
good. Goods so purchased would be expected to total about US$54.5 million
(Bank, US$22.0 million) and would cover vehicles, equipment, fertilizers



- 23 -
and  factory equipment.   Contracts  for  goods and  services worth less
than US$100,000 would be procured on the basis of competitive bidding
advertised locally, in accordance with local procedures satisfactory to
the Bank. Such contracts would not be expected to exceed US$9.6 million
(Bank, US$5.0 million). Contracts for civil works estimated to cost less
than US$50,000 would be procured after having obtained quotations from at
least  three contractors.   Should  suitable contractors not be readily
available, such civil works would be undertaken by force account (US$16.3
million, Bank US$7.0 million).   Past exl)erience has shown that worker
houses and social buildings, scattered on various distant estates are
unlikely to attract foreign bidders.  About 180 man-months of technical
assistance staff would be required during the project period (para 3.17) at
an average cost of US$11,700 per man-month, total US$2.0 million (Bank
US$1.0 million). The remaining expenditure (US$69.6 million, Bank US$15.0
million) represents SOCAPALM and CAMDEV personnel and operating costs.
F. Disbursements
3.26      The Bank loan of US$50.8 million would be disbursed over about
six years and would cover 33% of total project costs including taxes and
35% of total costs net of taxes. A proposed schedule of disbursement is in
Appendix Table III.6.  The percentages of disbursement proposed in this
annex have been based on experienced averages of Bank-financed tree crop
projects in Cameroon.   Thus the loan is expected to be disbursed in a
shorter period than the one proposed in the Region-wide disbursement
profile  for the perennial  crops  subsector.   The Bank  loan would  be
allocated as follows:

Disbursement would be fully documented except those in respect of SOCAPALM
and CAMDEV operating costs and works carried out by force account where
certified statements of expenditures would be used, and the supporting
documentation would be retained by the project units concerned and made
available for inspection during the course of project supervision
missions.
G. Accounts, Audit and Reporting Requirements
3.27      SOCAPALM financial management has  improved under the second
project and the company has now a sound and reliable accounting system both
in financial and cost accounting.  Detailed yearly budgets are made with
the cooperation of all estates and headquarters' staff and monthly
comparisons between actual and budgeted costs are made by the internal
audit  service.    Further  improvement  will  be  obtained  when  all  the
accounting process has been computerized.



- 25 -
3.28      CAMDEV's accounting system, though respecting the standards of
sound accounting practice, needs to be improved.  The manual, costly and
time-consuming system adopted in the early 50s has not evolved in spite of
the rapid growth of the corporation and the management and accounting
reorganization study (para 1.24) will have to make adequate recommenda-
tions to modernize the present system.
3.29      Both companies would continue to appoint independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank for the annual auditing of their accounts.   The
audit reports would be submitted to the Bank within six months of the close
of each financial year, that is not later than December 31. The auditor's
opinion on project expenditures would include verification whether:   (i)
goods and services had been procured from member countries of the Bank,
Switzerland or Taiwan; (ii) goods had bsen received or work performed;
(iii) payment had been made; and (iv) special attention would be paid on
disbursements made under statements of expenditure.
IV. ORGANIZATION ANI) MANAGEMENT
Societe Camerounaise de Palmeraies (SOCAPALM)
4.01      SOCAPALM is a development corporation owned by the Government
(50.7%), the Societe Nationale d'Invest:lssements (SNI),  (9.3%) and the
National Produce Marketing Board  (40%).   The present chairman is the
Minister of Agriculture.   Except for the participation of a Government
Commissioner in its affairs, SOCAPALM functions as a normal commercial
entity, subject to the Cameroon Investment Code.
4.02      The General Manager is appointed by the Board of Directors on the
recommendation of the Minister of Economy and Plan, and is responsible for
day-to-day  management.    The  present  expatriate  General  Manager  was
appointed in 1979 and has performed satisfactorily.   The Headquarter's
management  team  has  been  reinforced  by  a newly  appointed  internal
financial controller.   An oil palm specialist from IRHO has been also
recently recruited to take charge of the research program.
4.03      All existing SOCAPALM estate managers are experienced oil palm
specialists with a proven capacity to administer day-to-day management
issues of individual plantations under their responsibility. Moreover, a
pool of experienced Cameroonian cadre has been developed through on-the-
job training. To consolidate this effort, the Government has organized a
training program for agricultural staff, whereas financial staff are
participating in training sessions performed by a consulting firm,
"Association pour la Formation des Cadres de l'Administration", AFCA. The
company's organization structure is showni in Chart No. 1.
SOCAPALM Outgrowers Program
4.04      SOCAPALM  is the managing  agency,  on behalf of FONADER,  for
outgrower development in the areas served by its oil mills.   Under the



- 26 -
SOCAPALM II project, a credit administration agreement was signed by
FONADER and SOCAPALM and this arrangement would continue under the
proposed project.   After a late and difficult start, the smallholders'
unit, (Service des Plantations Villageoises, SPV) which operates under the
supervision of a field Manager is now performing satisfactorily. With the
assistance of the internal financial controller, this unit has its own
accounts, expenditures are regularly claimed and paid by FONADER.   The
SOCAPALM II project has been a training ground for FONADER in undertaking
its responsibility for smallholder development. Regular contacts, flow of
information and funds have developped satisfactorily between SPV and
FONADER whose involvement in the smallholdeis' scheme has increased and
improved.    Disbursements  on  loans  1391-T-CM  and  1392-CM  related  to
SOCAPALM's smallholders scheme are kept up to date.
Cameroon Development Corporation (CAMDEV)
4.05      With concessions totalling 98,000 hectares CAMDEV is the largest
development corporation in the country; its 20,700 permanent staff and
seasonal workers, make it the biggest employer in Cameroon. It has a Board
of 12 members chosen among leading businessmen and civil servants
representing the main ministries concerned (agriculture, labor, finance),
and, as for SOCAPALM,has a Government Commissioner belonging to the
Ministry of Economic Affairs and Planning.   The corporation's organiza-
tion structure is shown in Chart No. 2.
4.06      CAMDEV's General Manager, a Cameroonian national with a strong
financial background has had a satisfactory record since he took over in
1974, but the corporation's senior management team needs strengthening, so
as to reorganize, improve and modernize its accounting and management
systems. Such needed improvements would be based upon recommendations of a
reorganization study to be undertaken (para 1.24). These recommendations
would be discussed between Government and the Bank before their implemen-
tation and are expected to lead to a tighter cost control mechanism and
improved efficiency of the corporation.
CAMDEV's Smallholders Program
4.07      This  program  suffered  earlier  from  accounting  procedure
weaknesses.    In  1981,  corrective  measures  were  introduced  to  open
individual accounts per participant necessary to trace each participants
balance of loan due and claim Bank loan financing. For this, a smallholder
specialist would be recruited to strengthen the unit's management,
supervise the extension staff training program and plan and organize the
planting program.
4.08      The  Credit Management  Agreement  between FONADER  and CAMDEV
initiated under the CAMDEV II Project would be updated and extended. The
amounts of cash grants to be paid to farmers would be specified, and
inidexed to reflect changes in the minimum wage. Furthermore, the flow of
funds from FONADER to CAMDEV to reimburse expenditures for the smallholder
program for which CAMDEV is FONADER's agent needs to be improved, as well
as FONADER's disbursement claims sent to co-financiers.

4.09      For the smallholders programs, Goverament would set the producer
prices for oil palm fruit bunches and rubber in consultation with SOCAPALM,
and CAMDEV at levels adequate to ensure a reasonable revenue to
smallholders from their plantings, and the recovery by SOCAPALM and CAMDEV
of the cost of collection and processing and other expenses related to
smallholder development.   Although it is yet too early to make useful
calculations for smallholder rubber prices, cash flow projections for
smallholder oil palm producers (in working files) who are now about to
begin harvesting,  shows that a purchase price of about 20% higher than
assumed in the CAMDEV II SAR would be requ.ired to allow recovery of
credit and a net return per man-day at level equal to that paid to plantation
workers.   During negotiations,  Government agreed also to periodically
exchange views with the Bank on the method Eor setting producer prices
(para 9.01(e)).
V. YIELDS
SOCAPALM
5.01      During appraisal  of  the second  SOCAPALM project,  production
estimates were based on the assumption that over 25 years, the average
annual FFB yield would be 12.9 tons per ha with a peak of 15 tons in Year 8
of production. However, actual production for the period 1973-79 has been
29% below appraisal mainly due to soil conditions, moisture deficit, labor
problems inadequate field maintenance and factory breakdowns. Management
at estate level has improved but still the environmental constraints will
remain and revised yield estimates have been clrawn up by SOCAPALM. These
new forecasts of yield potential are summarized below:

CAMDEV - Oil Palms
5.02      Yield  forecasts  for oil  palm  estates have been revised on
several occasions. Average yields over the bearing life were estimated at
appraisal at 12.2 tons FFB/ha for CAMDEV I (for the non-west coast estates
Located in the Tiko plain) and at 13.1 ton FFB/ha for CAMDEV II (estates
located on the west coast, benefiting from a more favorable climatic
condition).    Based  on  performances  to  date,  CAMDEV's  revised  yield
estimates are as follows:

CAMDEV - Rubber
5.03      Production from the old estates is expected to remain below 1.9
ton per hectare.  Although improved standards of tapping and the use of
stimulants are expected to raise yields, the genetic potential of clones
planted during the 1950s, and early 1960s is below that of current
plantings.  Many minor clones were planted on an experimental scale and
yield performance has in general been disappointing and these areas will
continue to depress overall average yield until the 1990s. Moreoever, poor
management and lack of tapping control has led to excessive bark consump-
tion; shortages of tappers, crop losses due to washouts and lack of
passable roads in rainy seasons also added to lower yields.   Under the
project, uneconomical areas due to bad clones and lack of bark will be
gradually replaced by high potential clones, the road network will be
improved, and organization of tapping will be strengthened, by an
increased training program, and appropriate tapping premiums.
5.04      However, the genetic potential of the clones planted under the
CAMDEV II project, and expected to be planted under the present project,
together with improvements in road network and tapping control, should
lead to yields at least as appraised if not higher, i.e. peak, production
of 2,200 kilo per hectare and an average yield of 1,780 kilo per hectare
during the bearing life.   Comparison with similar projects in Western
Africa is summarized below:

With similar genetic potential and labor shortages and turnover problem,
SAPH in Ivory Coast has already reached a prcduction of 2,300 kg/ha on 9
years old trees and expect to reach a peak production of 2,500 kg/ha, so
that with the comparatively low average of 1,780 kg/ha adopted, it is
reasonably assumed that this target will be reached.
Smallholders
5.05      Due  to  lower  standards  of  huEbandry,  and  less  regular
harvesting, outgrowers' production is expected to be only 60% of the yields
obtained from estate plantings.
VI. MARKETS AND PRICES
Rubber
6.01      All the rubber produced under the project would be sold in export
markets. The world market for natural and synthetic rubber is expected to
continue to grow during the rest of this century, although at somewhat
lower annual rates than the 5.5% rates experieaced in the 1970s. Moreover,
the share of this market supplied by natural rubber is projected to decline
to about 25% by 1990 owing to insufficient sup?lies, but remain at or above
this level to 2000 and beyond as new plantations made during the 1970s and
early 1980s begin to produce. Thus, natural rubber prices are expected to
rise throughout the 1980s and remain relatively constant in real terms
thereafter.  World reference prices for natural sheet rubber (RSS1, New
York) in 1981 constant terms are projected to rise from 136/kg in 1981 to
158/kg in 1985 and 166/kg in 1990. These world market indicative prices
translate into fob Douala prices for crumb ruLbber of the quality produced
by CAMDEV by deducting freight, insurance and marketing charges, and by
discounting world prices by about 6%, giving projected prices of CFAF
379/kg in 1985 and CFAF 400/kg in 1990 and beyond.

Palm Oil
6.02      Palm oil  is the principal  edible oil consumed in Cameroon,
accounting for about 64,000 t (or 83%) of the 77,000 t consumed annually.
About 13% of the oil consumed is cotton seed and groundnut oil, and 4% is
imported refined oil.  Of the palm oil, about 20,000 t (or about 31%) origi-
naLtes from artisanal production which enters local markets or is consumed
in farm households, and 44,000 t originates from the major oil palm
estates (of which SOCAPALM and CAMDEV contribute 27,300 t or 62%).  The
commercial market is supplied via numerous local wholesalers who purchase
the oil at the estates in quantities ranging from 1 t to over 30 t per
month.  Wholesale prices are fixed by decree each year at levels agreed
between the major producing estates and the Goveyment.  The average net-
of-tax wholesale price for 1981-82 of CFAF 158 -  is about 5% above the
average IBRD indicative world price, adjusted to FOB basis Douala (CFAF
151/kg), but is about 6% below the currently available import parity price.
Wholesale prices are fixed throughout the year. However, availability of
oil varies considerably between seasons because of the production response
to moisture. This leads to de facto rationing of oil among wholesalers by
the estates, and retail price variations of up to 100% between seasons of
shortage (December/January) and surplus production (May/June).  Owing to
the perishable nature of palm oil, its storage life is limited to about 3
months which presently limits the technical feasibility of storage as a
price regulator.
6.03      Including artisanal production of 20,000 t, about 80,000 t of
plantation grown palm oil and 10,000 t of other oils, Cameroonian
production of edible oil in 1980-81 was about 110,000 tons.  This means
that Cameroon is in a net export position in edible oils, exporting about
24,000 t per year or 22% of total production even though there are months
of palm oil shortages in local markets.  Owing to (a) the wide monthly
variation in palm oil production that results from there being a rainy and
dry season, and (b) the rise in acidity to unacceptable levels in palm oil
when it is stored past 2 months, the best marketing strategy for
Cameroonian estate producers is to export palm oil during the first half of
the fiscal year, even when export prices are lower than domestic wholesale
prices. As all estate producers face the possibility of having to export a
certain amount of oil, an informal agreement was developed among them in
which each undertakes to export a negotiated portion of his production
thereby sharing the less profitable market and assuring orderly marketing.
Although this arrangement tends to reduce price competition between the
producers -- which would erode the "official" wholesale price -- the strong
preference shown by groups of consumers for the oil originating in one or
other of the estates also reduces the possibility of meaningful price
competition   between   estate   producers   for   the  wholesale   trade.
Establishing more formal rules to control this marketing system would be
part of the strategy to be determined in the Bank's strategy dialogue
with Government (para 9.01(a)). This dialogue would be supported by a study
of the vegetable oil market to provide basic data on the absorptive
capacity of the domestic market.

VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
7.01      Cash flow statements, balance slheets and statements of projected
income for both CAMDEV and SOCAPALM are summarized in the Appendix Tables
I.1, I.2, I.3, I.4, VII.1 and VII.2. Detailed supporting tables have been
retained in the working files.   The origin of both companies recent
financial difficulties can be traced in the balance sheets between 1977 and
1981, the period covering the execution of the second SOCAPALM and CAMDEV
projects.   The increase in fixed assets has been much higher than the
increase in long-term sources of funds.  Investment costs have substan-
tially exceeded appraisal estimates, while self-generated funds have
fallen far short of forecasts. With insufficient permanent capital, both
companies were obliged to resort to short-term bank overdrafts to meet
their working capital needs.
7.02      From 1983 onward, new downward Bank pric, projections as of
December  1981 were  adopted.    During  this consolidation  phase,  both
companies will have heavy debt service conmmitments arising out of previous
borrowings as well as additional financial charges on project loans: US$44
million for SOCAPALM and US$46 million for CAMDEV.  To strengthen their
liquidity and reduce the impact of debt service, Government will inject
additional funds to those already committed (medium term loans of $5.5
million for SOCAPALM and US$7.4 million for CAMDEV), and part of the Bank
loan would be passed-on as equity (US$4.3 million for SOCAPALM and US$3.7
million for CAMDEV).
7.03      The analysis for the period 1988-2000 shows common features for
both companies, mainly a steady increasje in their permanent capital.
Previous investment efforts would pay off when new areas planted with
clones of high yield potential would come to maturity.   SOCAPALM should
reach a peak yield of about 12 tonis FFB/ha between 1989 and 1994 (against a
present average of 8 tons) while CAMDEV's rubber yields should reach 1,900
in the late 90s (against a present average of 1,200 kg/ha).  Moreover,
SOCAPALM would have its entire area in production by 1987 while CAMDEV's
mature area would steadily increase to reach 91% in 1991. The cumulative
effects of these two factors, together with diminishing financial charges
would boost self-generated funds which should, in the 90s, average US$12
million per year for SOCAPALM and US$37 million per year for CAMDEV.
External loans would be constantly reduced to nearly exhaustion in year
2000.
7.04      Regarding the investment programs for the period 1980 to 2000,
different  assumptions have been made  for SOCAPALM and  CAMDEV.   For
SOCAPALM, and until an oil palm and rubber development strategy is agreed
upon, it has been assumed that no extension or replanting would be made.
Investments are thus limited to renewz.l of buildings and equipment,
absorbing only 26% of self-generated funds. However, the financial ratios
(in working files) indicate that normal replanting of aging areas and
extension of planted area by 7,000 ha coconut plantation would be feasible
after 1989. For CAMDEV, it has been assunLed that the present planted area



- 32 -
of 38,000 ha would be maintained. Thus, between 1986 and 2000, it would be
necessary to replant, though not necessarily with the same crop, about
12,000 hectares of oil palms and 5,000 hectares of rubber. This replanting
program would cost approximately US$155 million and would be financed
by a Government loan (US$ 11 million) and self-generated funds (US$144
million).
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Benefits
8.01      Through continued support of the plantation investment program
embarked upon by CAMDEV and SOCAPALM, the project would enable the bringing
into production of immature oil palm and rubber plantings, the selective
replanting of existing old estates and continued expansion of the
associated smallholder programs. This would yield at full production
83,400 t of palm oil for domestic consumption and export and 34,900 t of
rubber for export which, at projected world market prices, would generate
at least US$79 million of foreign exchange (in 1981 terms) per year.
B. Economic Analysis
8.02      Methodology.  Separate rates of return have been calculated for
each of the project's main productive components. These amount to 93% of
project costs, the remaining costs being associated with technical and
infrastructural support to CAMDEV and SOCAPALM that are not related to the
planting programs being supported by the project. For components where the
project is supporting the bringing into production of already planted
areas (i.e. the latter part of the investment period only), the rate of
return has been calculated inclusive of previously incurred investment
costs. An alternative procedure would have been to present rates of return
on the basis of costs and benefits incurred from commencement of the
proposed project thereby leaving out sunk costs. Such a presentation would
have had the merit of more closely reflecting the decision concerning
whether to go ahead with the project or not but gives no indication of the
overall economic viability of each of the components being supported by the
project which is considered more useful. In any case, as can be expected,
such "incremental" rates of return are very high, illustrating the clear
desirability of continuing estate maintenance through the remaining
investment and production period once the initial heavy investment in land
clearing and planting has been incurred. The low rates of return on some
of the estates calculated inclusive of sunk costs should, therefore, also
be viewed in this perspective.



- 33 -
8.03      All costs were taken net-of-tax, and included physical contin-
gencies. Costs for equipment, civil works and operating costs were brought
to border-price equivalents by applying a Standard Conversion Factor of
0.77 to the local cost component of each. Labor costs were valued at net--
of-tax plantation wages which were also brought to their border-price
equivalents by the same standard conversion factor. Rubber production was
valued FOB Douala, based on current Bank projections of world market
prices, adjusted to reflect the grade structure of Cameroonian production.
Palm oil was valued on an export parity basis, FOB Douala.  The export
price rather than the higher import equivalent price was chosen as
projections of Cameroonian palm oil production and consumption indicate
that although the bulk of production will be consumed locally, Cameroon is
likely to be a marginal exporter and project production has therefore been
evaluated on this basis. In-country tran3port costs were included as part
of project production cost. All costs anc revenues were expressed in March
1982 constant terms.
8.04      Rates  of Return.   Rate  of return results  are presented  in
Appendix Table VIII.1 summarized below:
First generation oil palm               10.0
First generation rubber                 12.2
Second generation rubber                16.7
Smallholders oil palm                   13.1
Smallholders rubber                     15.8
Total Project                      12.4
For the project as a whole, the rate of return is estimated at
12.4%. As described in para 8.02, this has been calculated inclusive of
sunk costs incurred prior to the project period on those estates where the
project is supporting plantings through only the last years of the
investment period. As these activities form a large part of the project
(66% of project costs) the project rate Df return calculated exclusive of
sunk costs would be 22.4% (Appendix Table VIII.2).
8.05      Appendix  Table  VIII.1  differentiates  between  the  project's
"first"  and "second"  generation  estates.   A  first  generation estate
involves clearing of forested land and establishment of a road network,
worker villages and processing plants. Second generation plantings on old
unproductive estates involve much lower initial investment costs; only
light felling of old trees and upgrading or selective replacement of
existing infrastructure.   The economic viability of second generation
plantings is therefore higher and this is illustrated above. Thus, whereas
the first generation rubber estates have a 12.3% rate of return, the second
generation rubber estates to be established under the project have a rate
of return of 16.9%. First generation oil palm has a lower overall rate of
return (10.0%) than first generation rulbber, a finding also reflected in
second generation plantings and in the pr-oject's design which involves the
replanting only of rubber.



- 34 -
8.06      Rates of return from the smallholder programs -- 13.1% for oil
palm smallholders and 15.9% for rubber smallholders -- are higher than the
rates of return from first generation estate plantings due primarily to
lower land clearing costs and some savings on infrastructure (worker
viLlages) which more than compensates for the lower expected yields from
the smallholder program.  Continued investment in smallholder production
is therefore more attractive than clearing new areas for first generation
estate plantings.   Of interest, however,  is to compare the smallholder
plantings with the rate of return from the second generation rubber estates
which have a higher rate of return.  This finding should be taken into
account in the establishment of the oil palm and rubber development
strategy (para 1.12).
8.07      Some comments can be made concerning the rate of return by
individual estate.  As concern the rubber estates, Tombel has a low (9.8%)
rate of return and it has been decided to limit the planting program from
1,000 ha forecasted during appraisal of the Second CAMDEV Project to the
200 ha already planted.  Amongst the oil palm estates, Dibombari with a
9.7% rate of return is an important nucleus for smallholder development
with a 2,000 ha smallholder program currently being financed with
assistance from FED. SOCAPALM's Edea and Eseka oil palm estates would not
be financed under the proposed project and results are therefore not
presented in Appendix Table VIII.1. Eseka is estimated to have a 6.5% rate
of return (including sunk costs) but it would be continued as it is a
nucleus for the smallholder program. The 570 ha Edea estate has a negative
rate of return and, it has been recommended that this be broken down into
small and medium size holdings.
C. Sensitivity and Risk
8.C08     On the estates,  costs and yields have been estimated taking
account of the current low performance of CAMDEV and SOCAPALM and assuming
gradual improvements during the investment period which would be supported
by the management strengthening and other improvements to be effected
during the project. Such improvements are considered feasible given that
CAFDEV  and  SOCAPALM  managements  will  be  essentially  concerned  with
consolidation rather than expansion. SOCAPALM management will be further
aided by the socio-ethnological study that would be financed under the
project to help reduce the high levels of labor absenteeism and turnover
that now exist (para 3.11).  For CAMDEV, internationally recruited staff
would be placed in line positions for 3 years and the consultant study
financed under the project on management and accounting procedures (para
1.24) would provide a basis for the necessary reorganization. Efforts made
since June 1981 are encouraging and are illustrative of the amount of
headway that can be made towards cutting costs. Thus, on CAMDEV's estates
labor costs (which make up over 60% of estate costs subsequent to planting)
have been cut by 10% and room for continued improvement exists. Yields can
also increase through improved harvesting and tapping and upgraded estate
roads (financed under the project) which in their current state result in a



- 35 -
loss of 5% of production. A shortage of tappers -- due to the unsatisfac-
tory premium system that will be addressed under the project (para 5.03) --
also reduces  current yields.   In view of  the above,  cost and yield
assumptions are considered reasonable and could be further improved upon
if the management strengthening and studies financed under the project are
carried through satisfactorily.
8.09      On  smallholdings  the  principal  risk  is  that,  because  of
inadequate extension support, farmers would not take sufficient care of
their plantings during the immature phase, resulting in reduced yields at
maturity or even, in extreme cases, abandonment of the holding. This would
lead to problems in the recovery of credit,  To minimize these risks the
management of CAMDEV's smallholder unit would be strengthened (para
9.01(c)).  It would also be important to ensure farm gate price for both
oil palm fruit bunches and rubber that provide sufficient incentive to
farmers to maximize production from their hcildings. Government has agreed
to set producer prices at levels to ensure acequate returns to smallholders
from their plantings, and to periodically exchange views with the Bank on
the method for setting producer prices to both estates and smallholders
(paras 4.09 and 9.01(c)).
IX. ASSURANCES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      The following major points were agreed to at negotiations:
(a)  No further expansion would be undertaken by HEVECAM, SOCAPALM
and CAMDEV during the project per:od, and, prior to December 31,
1984 Government would review with the Bank its proposed oil palm
and rubber development strategy for the Sixth Plan (para 1.12).
(b) Government would, not later than June 30, 1983 make equity con-
tributions of CFAF 1,000 millior to SOCAPALM (para 1.20) and
CFAF 1,000 million to CAMDEV, and not later than June 30, 1984,
make an equity contribution of CFAF 1,000 million to CAMDEV
(para 1.24).
(c) Measures would be proposed before December 31, 1983 concerning
staff incentives, and Government would inform the Bank of any
proposed measures to improve staff pension systems (para 1.24).
(d) Government would make two interes3t free, medium term loans: of
CFAF 1,000 million to SOCAPALM and of CFAF 2,000 million to
CAMDEV (para 3.23).
(e) Government would periodically exchange views with the Bank on
the method for setting producer prices for rubber and fresh
fruit bunches (para 4.09).



- 36 -
9.,02     Conditions of loan effectiveness would be:
(a) actual deposits of the first tranches of capital increases both
for SOCAPALM (CFAF 1,000 million, para 1.20) and CAMDEV (CFAF
4,000 million, para 1.24);
(b) recruitment of the five specialists for CAMDEV (para 1.24);
(c) fulfillment of all conditions precedent for the effectiveness of
the CDC, CCCE and BEI loans (para 3.24); and
(d) signature and effectiveness of satisfactory separate financing
agreements between Government and SOCAPALM and CAMDEV (para
3.24).
9.03      Conditions of disbursement would be:
(a) Concerning CAMDEV expenditures, that the five internationally
recruited specialists have taken up their posts (para 1.24).
Cb) Concerning smallholder expenditures:
(i)   that   satisfactory   separate   Credit   Administration
Agreements have been signed by FONADER with SOCAPALM and
CAMDEV respectively and have become effective (para 3.24);
and
(ii) a satisfactory financing agreement between Government and
