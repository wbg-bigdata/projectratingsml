internal Bank memoranda on project issues as contained in relevant Bank files,
as well as interviews with officials both in the Bank and in Romania who have
been associated with the Project.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments, and
a telex was received on Sertember 22, 1987 from BAFI. These comments have
been incorporated and are attached as Annex 2.
The project has not been subjected to an audit by OED.

ROMANIA
LIVESTOCK HI (POULTRY) PROJECT
(LOAN 1764-RO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.       The project was the first poultry investment supported by the Bank in
Romania with a loan of US$85 million. It was administered by the Bank for
Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI) who made funds available and supervised
the implementation of sub-projects carried out by cooperatives and state
enterprises.
Objectives
2.       The project supported the objectives of Romania's National
Development Plan (1980-85) which included (a) breeding of high quality broiler
parent stock; (b) expansion of broiler growing units; (c) provision of new and
modernized slaughterhouses; and (d) support to research, quality and disease
control.
Implementation Experience
3.       Project costs amounted to Lei 5,869 million compared to an appraisal
estimate of Lei 5,605 million, an increase of about 4.7%. In US Dollar terms,
the actual cost was US1320.7 million, compared to US$311 estimated at
appraisal. A smaller number of cooperatives were beneficiaries of the project
than were envisaged at appraisal, and a larger number of State Agriculture
Enterprises (IAS) participated. Uinder the project: 47 new broiler breeding
farms were constructed with a capacity to produce 179 million chicks annually,
3 broiler farms were modernized and 49 new broiler farms were constructed
producing about 177,000 hens annually; and 14 slaughterhouses were constructed
capable of processing about 105,000 tons per year. The increased capacity of
both broiler breeding farms and broiler production exceeded appraisal
estimates. Physical implementation proceeded satisfactorily up to the
completion of the project. Procurement and disbursement proceeded without any
significant delays. Due to a reallocation of funds to construct more broiler
breeding and IAS broiler farms, the project was completed with a delay of six
months.
4.       One of the main issues raised during the preparation of the project
was the introduction of a mechanized cage system for broiler productior.. The
project was appraised in 1979, based on the partial results of a pilot
mechanized cage operation. After minor modifications in design, the system
was deemed superior to the conventional deep litter floor design. Mid-way
through the implementation of the project, it became clear that the investment
and operating costs of the mechanized cage system were significantly higher
than previously estimated, and BAFI requested that :emaining funds be used for
construction of the conventional system. However, this view was changed, some



(iv)
important improvements were introduced into the cage system design, .and the
system was retained. However, thc adequacy of the cage system has not been
resolved unequivocally.
Results and Sustainabiitl
5.       Despite the improvement in the genetic quality of the broiler
population by the importation of 40,000 broiler grandparents, the broilers'
performance has been deteriorating in recent years as a result of low protein
content in the feed. The supply of grain/protein feed was envisaged at
appraisal as *a critical factor in the success of the project. However, the
Government insisted that supply of protein feed would be adequate and refused
any suggestions by the Bank to include in the project provisio.as for supply of
protein feed. A covenant was included in the loan agreement which required
Romania to reach a feed conversion ratio of at most 2.3 kg of feed per kg of
meat liveweight gain produced under the project. At the insistence of the
Romanian negotiators, a more explicit covenant regarding protein feed
importation was not included. The quality of feed did not improve over the
project period, and conversion ratios remain at about 3.1. Assuming that the
present practice of low quality feed continues, the rate of return for the
broiler complexes falls to 0% (compared to 17% at appraisal), and the overall
rate of return for the project is 42 (comiared to i22 at appraisal)."'
Findings and Lessons
6.       The following points may be of particular interest:
(a) The first Bank appraisal mission was critical of the project design,
mainly the broiler 2arms in cages, and rightfully recommended to
postpone the project by one year until more operational data could be
obtained. On the basis of pilot operational results, the cage system
was later recommended, however, the cage system has remained
controversial. It might have been more prudent to finance the
broiler farms based on the cage method in stages and monitor the
results.
(b) Rather than addressing the issue of the importation of protein
livestock feed head-on, it was decided to try to remedy the situation
indirectly by covenanting a technical coefficient that required the
borrower to reach a certain feed to meat ratio. This solution failed
because:
(i) there was never agreement between the Bank and the Romanian
authorities that the importation of protein feed deserved high
priority in the allocation of Romania's scarce foreign exchange
resources. The linkage between the protein feed requirement and
the foreign exchange needed to supply it, given the lack of
domestic production, and an assessment of the relative benefit
to the economy from broiler production, were never clearly
demonstrated; and
(ii) a covenant was devised which required the borrower to achieve a
certain physical target, without dealing specifically with the
constraints on the means to achieve that target.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The livestock subsector in Romania is dualistic with about two-thiris
of livestock numbers being in the social sector (the state farms and CAPs) and
one-third in the individual sector. The social sector is generally
characterized by large scale production units. The individual sector includes
both individual farmers and cooperative members, who operate, in addition to
their regular work in the cooperative, a small herd or flock size, typically
one to three animals, or one to two hundred birds, in backyard production
systems. The table below summarizes the distribution of livestock between the
two sectors as of February 1985 and the breakdown of meat sales in 1984:
Sheep
Cattle    Pigs      and Goats      Poultry

Based on weight of livestock sold for meat and the retained weight of
increased herd numbers. Figures do not allow for substantial
intersectoral transfers.
From the above table it is evident that poultry is the second most important
source of meat supply after the pig industry. Within the poultry subsector,
the share of the social and individual sectors in supply of meat is about the
same. However, this is despite the fact that about 77% of the broilers are
produced in the qocial Sector and that 62% of the layers are in the individual
sector. The relative lower contribution of meat per bird in the social sector
reflects lower slaughterweights compared to the individual sector despite the
fact that the social sector is more capital intensive and receives more
support from the state for research, marketing, feed supply and financing.
The main reason for the lower slaughterweights of the social sector has been
the deficient protein feed supply, which is related to the Government shortage
of foreign exchange to purchase protein feed. The individual sector
production, onithe other hand, is not dependent on intensive feed supplies,
and, therefore, it has not been affected significantly by protein feed
shortages.



-2-
1.02     In 1962 the first intensive broiler complex was built in Romania
which established the basis for the expansion of an integrated Dreeding
broiler production and slaughterhouse system. Between 1970 and 1975 State
Breeding Enterprises first introduced egg layer cages and increased production
of layer stocks by 2.4 times and egg numbers by 2.5 times. During the same
period both the state and cooperative sectors increased their broiler
production five-fold. Between 1976 and 1985 the growth moderated
significantly. The number of layers increased by about 202, all attributed to
the social sector growth, and the number of broilers about doubled, also with
most of the growth coming from tthe social sector. Meat production, however,
during the same period increased only by about 47Z, indicating that it was
lagging significantly behind the growth in the total number of birds or number
of broilers and reflecting decreased efficiency of the subsector.
1.03     The project represented a four-year time slice of Romania's National
Development Plan for 1980-1985 for the poultry production and processing
program. The project was fully in compliance with the Plan objectives to
modernize and expand poultry production and included: (a) 37 broiler breeding
farms; (b) modernization of 20 existing broiler production farms; (c) 28 new,
mechanized broiler production farms; (d) 15 new poultry slaughterhouses; and
(e) provision for specialized equipment, including training for its use, to be
used in quality control, applied research, disease isolation, identification
and control, and performance standards improvements, which included provision
for infusion of pure line breeding stock with imported pedigree stock (for
details, see Project Description, para 2.12). i.ring implementation the
project remained consistent with the initial objectives. However, investment
in some eomnponents was more, and in others was less than originally planned.
1.05     The project was the first poultry investment program supported by the
Bank in Romania. It also received cofinancing, and altogether foreign
financing covered about 55 of the project cost. The project was administered
by the Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI), which had been the
Borrower for seven previous Bank loans for agricultural projects. BAFI's
branch offices were responsible for direct supervision of subproject
implementation to be carried out by cooperatives and state enterprises.
Technical assistance was provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food
Industry (MAFI), through the Center for Poultry Production (Avicola). Avicola
has been coordinating subsector plannir,g, feed distribution, breeding
programs, hatcheries, production, slaughter and processing, investment and
distribution of final products.
1.06     Project risks were considered to be minimal.  Levels of performance
and efficiency observed at appraisal were acceptable and the Government had
well coordinated plans to supply the necessary manpower, materials, technical
expertise, and a satisfactory grain/protein feed base to implement the project
successfully. The supply of grain/protein feed was one of the critical
factors, ervisaged at appraisal, for the success of the project, and a
covenant was included in the Loan Agreement which prescribed the maximum
feed/meat conversion ratio to be reached under the project. However, lack of
foreign exchange to import protein feed, namely soybeans, and Romania's
inability to significantly increase domestic protein feed production to
47 34Z



-3-
satisfy the needs of a rapidly increasing poultry and pig industry, have
seriously affected the economic viability of an otherwise physically well
implemented and adequate'ly managed project.l'
1.07     The PCR is based upon the findings of the various supervision
missions during the course of the project implementation. Project related
Bank files dating back to 1977 were reviewed and a draft project completion
report, prepared by BAFI, provided the borrower's assessment of the project's
implementation and impact.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Origin
2.01     The project was first discussed with the Government in December
1975. In February 1976, the proposed project was considered by the Bank to be
included as one of three components (greenhouses, poultry and cattle
production) in an Agricultural Credit Project. During a Bank identification
mission in March/April 1976, the Government provided investment details for
the Poultry and Egg production component and a project brief was prepared in
April 1976. Government agreed to submit a preparation report to the Bank by
the end of 1976, but did not. During a supervision mission of other projects
in the spring of 1977, Government indicated that one component (greenhouses)
of the proposed credit project would be dropped, leaving the poultry and
cattle components. In May 1977, the Government provided preliminary studies
to the Bank for these two components. The Bank reviewed the summaries and
requested that a detailed preparation report be prepared and submitted to the
Bank.  The dairy cattle componen. preparation was received in early July 1977
and appraisal of a cattle/poultry project was planned for August 1977.
B. Preparation and Appraisal
2.02     The main issue raised during the August 1977 appraisal regarding the
poultry component was the decision by the Romanian Government that investments
in broiler production during the five year plan (1976-80) would be primarily
in a mechanized cage system, reportedly develope  in Hungary, rather than in a
conventional deep litter system. The main arguments in favor of the cage
system were that it would increase efficiency in the use of housing space
(about 3 times more broilers per m2 of fioor space), and thereby save
agricultural land for production purposes. The disadvantages mentioned by the
appraisal mission included: (a) higher capital costs; (b) greater managerial
skills required; (c) increased number of downgraded broiler carcasses; and
(d) feed wastage. In addition, the appraisal mission found that the new
mechanized cage technology proposed by the Romanians had only recently been
introduced in the country and the first pilot facility was only then being put
into operation at Giarmata, Timisoara. A conventional deep litter floor type
house was being modified so that the mechanized rows of cages could be
installed. Experimental cage rearing of broilers had been conducted at other
facilities (30 Decembrie and Arad) using standard layer type cages, but only
part of the technical and financial results were relevant to mechanized
1/ See borrower comments, Annex 2.

-4-
cages. As a result, the appraisal mission recommended, and the Bank
concurred, to postpone for one year any involvement in financing of this
component until more operational data could be obtained. Following the
appraisal the Bank decided to separate the cattle component of the project
from the poultry component and eventually the cattle component was appraised
in 1980 as the Livestock IV (Cattle) Project (Loan 1993-RO).
2.03     A new identification mission visited Romania during September 1978 to
review the project concept and results from the pilot operation at Giarmata.
Since the mechanized cage equipment being produced in Timisoara was not
delivered on time, only eight lots of broilers were grown between September
1977 and September 1978 instead of 36.4 lots (as planned). Nevertheless, in
the opinion of the September 1978 identification mission, sufficient data were
collected from this station to provide a basis for evaluating the system. The
main finding indicated that the investment cost to produce 218 tons of
broilers liveweight per annum was about Lei 3.3 million (about US$140,700) for
the new mechanized cage system and about Lei 3.6 million (about US$153,500)
for the existing conventional floor type houses. The net income was projected
to be about Lei 2,400 (about US$102) per ton, liveweight, for the cage system,
and about Lei 1,530 (about US$65) per ton for the existing floor houses.
2.04     Rearing broilers in a mechanized cage system was recognized by the
identification mission to require increased management skills. However, the
mission believed that with training of workers and proper supervision by
managerial staff, this potential disadvantage would not be a problem. The
mission also concluded that changes in the design of the cages as a result of
experience gained in pilot operations, and which had already been incorporated
into the standard design, had reduced the feed wastage noted by the Augus.
1977 appraisal mission. Concerning the issue of cages causing downgraded
broiler carcasses, the mission reported that in practice there was no
significant difference in the incidence of blisters and other defects in
broilers coming from cages or deep litter. The mission did observe that bone
abnormalities and leg weakness can be a problem in broilers raised in cages.
However, such problems more than likely could be reduced or eliminated by
nutritional changes, The mission also reported that labor costs for
conventiorTl floor houses were slightly higher than in cage-reared broilers.
2.05     The identification mission raised one more important issue, namely
the quality of feed. The mission reported that feed conversion rates were
higher than those being achieved in other countries and this contributed to
longer feed out periods and smaller broilers at slaughter. The major
constraint was reported to be the low protein content of poultry feed in
Romania. However, the mission concluded that although removal of the protein
feed constraint could have a significant efficiency impact, future expansion
and modernization of the poultry subsector would remain an economically viable
industry even with this constraint. Also, the mission suggested that the
Government's commitment to increase domestic meat supplies testified to its
strong motivation to correct the deficiency in availability of protein feeds.
2.06     The project was finally appraised in March 1979.  Government insisted
the supply of protein feed would le adequate and refused any suggestions by
47 34Z



the Bank to include in the project provisions for supply of protein feed. The
appraisal mission reported in the Issues Paper that there were no significant
issues, except that the US$65 million of Bank funds which were allocated to
the project were insufficient, and that an additional US$25 to US$50 million
were necessary to cover the project's foreign exchange needs.
2.07     The draft Yellow Cover report was issued in July 1979 and in August
1979 the Loan Committee cleared the loan package with a provision to increase
the loan to US$80 million. The estimated cost of the project was US$311.4
million with a foreign exchange component of US$109.2 million. The proposed
Bank loan of US$80 million was to finance 73% of the foreign exchange cost,
with the balance to be financed by cofinanciers. Subborrowers' contribution
was to be 8.7% oc the project cost and the remaining 59% was to be financed by
the Government (BAFI).  The project had an estimated economic rate of return
of 12% (based on a conversion ratio of about 2.3, which was expected to be
achieved during implementation).
C. Negotiatioas
2.08     Negotiations were held from September 5 to 12, 1979.  There were no
changes of substance in project design or operation from the draft Loan
Documents. However, the following additional matters were agreed: (a) an
increase in the Loan amount to US$85 million, by transferring US$5 million
from the proposed loan for the Covurlui Irrigation Project (Loan 1795-RO,
approved in 04/08/1980), and (b) inclusion of a covenant which required
Romania to reach a feed conversion ratio of at most 2.3 kg of feed per kg of
liveweight gain produced under the project. The implication of this covenant
was that import or domestic production of protein feed would have to increase
in order to improve the feed quality. However, at the insistence of the
Romanian negotiators, the Bank agreed not to include an explicit covenant
regarding protein feed imports.
D. Board Presentation
2.09     The project was approved by the Executive Directors on October 30,
1979.  The main issues raised during the Board discussion were:
(a) whether the Bank was justified to lend for a project which would
increase the per capita consumption of poultry meat in Romania from
11 kg p.a., which was already considered relatively high by
developing country standards, to 18 kg, which was a level typical in
many industrialized countries. The Bank stafLf response was that the
project was important mainly due to its contribution to increase the
productivity of the agricultural sector and the poultry subsector in
particular;
(b) whether the project could be financed by other sources rather than
the Bank. The staff response was that, though cofinancing had been
sought, it was unlikely that commercial banks would participate in
financing the foreign exchange cost of the project without the Bank;
(c) the significance of using the financial rate of return in a centrally
planned system. The staff response was that the Romanians were
47 34Z



-6-
becoming more sensitive to signals from the market, and that
appreciation of the usefulness of rate of return evaluation is a slow
process, but eventually the Romanians are likely to recognize its
usefulness; and
(d) how is it acceptable that the interest rates for Bank funds onlent
under the project would be between 2 and 4 percent while the Bank is
charging 7.95% for the Loan. The staff response was that because of
controlled prices the annual inflation rate in Romania was onlv about
1%, and therefore the onlending rate zepresented a positivz real
interest rate. The staff also pointed out that interest rate does
not play a role in allocation of funds by the Government.
There were no special conditions attached for effectiveness and the loan was
signed on December 17, 1979.
E. Targets and Goals
2.10     The main objective of the project was to increase production of
poultry meat primarily for the domestic market through the improvement of
breed quality, improvement of feed conversion ratios, production efficiency in
new units and improvement of existing units, and hygiene and disease control.
The project was to develop an annual incremental production capacity of about
162,800 tons liveweight of broilers utilizing about 524,990 tons of feed per
annum, of which about 182,000 tons would be for breeding farms and about
342,990 for broiler farms.
2.11     The main flaws of the project design were twofold.  First, the
development of the poultry program was not sufficiently integrated with the
feed supply program. The need for incremental protein supply was clearly
recognized by the Bank staff appraising the project, but the resolution of the
issue relied on a legal covenant that required Romania to reach a low feed
conversion ratio rather than a detailed program to ensure adequate feed
supply. Secondly, the development of brciler supply was based exclusively on
the social sector increase in production capacity. No attempt was made to
evaluate whether it would have been more efficient to increase the production
capacity of the individual sector, or a combination of the two sectors.
F. Project Description
2.12     The project was to consist of four major components:
(a) the breeding of high quality broiler parent stock for production of
day-old broilers for stocking State Agriculture Enterprise (IAS),
Agriculture Production Cooperatives (CAPs) and individual sector
growing units. The investment was to include 37 broiler breeding
farms, each with an average annual capacity to produce 6,550,000
day-old chicks. Each farm would consist of 18 two-story masonry
houses, a hatchery and supporting utility facilities;
(b) the continued expansion of broiler growing units utilizing a
mechanized cage system which included: (i) modernization of 20
47 34Z



-7-
existing broiler production farms which would increase the capacity
of each unit by an average incremental output of about 2,400 tons of
liveweight broilers per year; and (ii) 28 new mechanized broiler
production farms, each with an average capacity of 4,100 tons per
year;
(c) the provision of new and modernized poultry slaughterhouses as part
of the integrated poultry production system. The investment was to
include 15 new poultry slaughterhouses, with an average annual
throughput of about 3,750 tons liveweight poultry on the basis of a
single shift operation; and
(d) the provision of specialized laboratory equipment, including training
in its use, and pure line infusion with imported pedigree stock
essential to support the expanded, national poultry investment
program. The equipment and pedigree stock would also be used in
supporting the improvement of poultry health and performance
standards.
2.13     Total project cost at appraisal was estimated at Lei 5,605 million
(US$311.4 million) of which the foreign exchange component was Lei 1,965
million (US$109.2 million) or about 35%. These estimates included US$0.4
million taxes and import duties on items expected to be directly imported
under the project.
2.14     The cost estimates were based on prices projected to prevail at the
end of 1979.  An allowance of 5% was included for physical contingencies.
Price contingency allowances were 1% per annum for 1980 through 1984 on all
domestic components and 6.0% annually on foreign exchange components for 1980
through 1984. The exchange rate used in estimating project costs was the
official trading rate of Lei 18 to US$1. The Bank loan of US$85 million was
for a term of 15 years, including 3 years' grace at an interest rate of 7.95%
per annum. The balance of the foreign exchange needs of about US$25 million
was envisaged to come from a cofinancing arrangement to be assisted by the
Bank. CAPs and State Enterprises were to carry out project investments under
agricultural credit subprojects administered by BAFI. BAFI's branch officers
were to be responsible for direct supervision of subproject imple-mentation.
Technical assistance was to be provided by Avicola, which is affiliated with
MAFI and has the ultimate responsibility for integrated poultry and egg
production throughout the country.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Start-up
3.01     The loan became effective on April 15, 0980 and the project start-up
was immediate. By the end of September 1980, BAFI had already committed 53%
of the loan-financed project costs and BAFI disbursements were ahead of the
appraisal projections.  Bank loan disbursements were about 1.7 times ahead of
appraisal disbursement schedule, and procurement was proceeding
47 34Z



-8-
satisfactorily. The implementation of IAS and CAP mechanized broiler
production farms and poultry slaughterhouses was in line with appraisal
forecasts. The main issue, however, identified by the Bank supervision in
October 1980, was that the shortage of protein in the feed supply had not
improved compared to the situation before the project and was likely to
undermine the expected benefits from the project.
B. Implementation
3.02     Generally, physical implementation continued to proceed
satisfactorily up to the completion of the project. However, demand was low
for moderniz ion of existing broiler complexes in CAPs, which included
conversion from a conventional deep litter system to a mechanized caging
system. The lack of interest by CAPs to convert to the cage system was due
primarily to their reluctance to borrow for expansion of poultry production
under the precarious poultry feed supply situation in Romania and their
skepticism in regard to the advantages of the cage system over the
conventional deep litter system. As a result the Bank agreed in June 1983 to
a reallocation of funds to construct an additional 21 IAS broiler farms and 14
broiler breeding farms. On the other hand, 17 CAP br,iler farms have not been
modernized and one poultry slaughterhouse not implemented (Annex 19 Table 1).
3.03     The main issue which persisted during the entire period of project
implementation was that the quality of feed did not improve. The results were
that, after seven to eight weeks of feeding, the broiler carcasses were
observed to weigh about 1.0 to 1.1 kg instead of 1.4 to 1.6 kg, and the
countrywide conversion ratios have been about 3.0. The target of reaching a
conversion ratio of 2.3 kg of feed per kg of meat, which was covenanted, was
not likely to be achieved.
3.04     The project was implemented between 1980 and 1985.  The annual
investment implementation proceeded along the appraisal estimated schedule for
1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983. Due to the reallocation of funds to construct more
broiler breeding and IAS broiler farms (para 3.02), the last 24 broiler
complexes were started in 1984. The project was therefore completed with a
delay of six months, in December instead of June 1985.
C. Procurement
3.04     In accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement (Supplemental
Letter No. 1) about US$83 million worth of goods for the project were to be
procured under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with
procedures consistent with those set forth in the "Guidelines for Procurement
Under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits" published in 1977. The balance of
US$2 million worth of goods were to be procured through international shopping
by soliciting bids from at least three countries. These items included
laboratory equipment, biological products and specialized slaughterhouse
equipment. All the bidding was organized by ROMAGRIMEX, an organization
affiliated with MAFI which is in charge of foreign trade transactions. The
table below gives a comparison of the list of goods to be procured as
stipulated under the Loan Agreement (Supplemental Leter No. 1), and the actual
procurement results:

3.05     Procurement under the project was handled efficiently.  The bidding
documents were approved by the Bank on July 31, 1980. Foreign suppliers did
not show interest in bidding for asbestos sheets, electric cables and
structural steel, and, in fact, only domestic manufacturers participated in
the bidding. Consequently, all the contracts for these materials were awarded
to Romanian suppliers. By contrast, bidding interest for slaughterhouse and
poultry farm equipment was robust. Ten bids were submitted for slaughterhouse
equipment, nine of which were from foreign firms, and nine bids were submitted
for poultry farm equipment, eight of which were from foreign firms.
Eventually all contracts were awarded to Romanian firms. For the laboratory
equipment, biological products and specialized slaughterhouse equipment,
Romagrimex carried out the international shopping effectively and all the
contracts were awardrd to foreign suppliers. There were no significant delays
in the bidding process, review by the Bank, or in the delivery of the
machinery and equipment procured.
D. Project Cost
3.06     The total project cost amounted to Lei 5,869 million compared with an
appraisal estimate of Lei 5,605 million, an increase of 4.7% (see Annex 1,
Table 2). In US Dollar terms, the actual cost was US$320.7 million (current
terms), compared to about US$311 estimated at appraisal, an increase of 3%.
3.07     In terms of cost per unit, there was no significant increase in the
cost of broiler breeding farm construction compared to the appraisal
estimate. However, the cost of slaughterhouse construction was about 8
percent higher than the appraisal estimate and the cost of broiler production
units was about 22% above the appraisal estimate. The main reason for the
relatively high deviation between the actu.al and appraised cost of broiler
complexes were the changes in design during implementation. The Bank approved
the changes that were expected to result in improved insulation; increased use
of prefabs in the construction; and improvement of the ventilation and heating
system. All these improvements have contributed to savings in energy costs
and to some extent in reduction of other operating costs.
E. Financing
3.08     The project financing compared to the appraisal estimate as follows:

/1 See para 3.10.
The increase in the project cost was financed from BAFI's own resources. The
share of the beneficiaries was lower than the appraisal estimate mainly due to
the smaller share of CAPs participating in the project. The IASs which
replaced them as beneficiaries arv obliged, according to statutory laws, to
contribute a smaller share to their investments.
3.09     According to Supplemental Letter No. 6 to the Loan Agreement,
financing for subprojects, including both the BAFI and the Bank contributions,
were to be onlent to CAPs at 3% and to IASs at 2% during construction and at
4% thereafter. In early 1983, however, interest rates were raised in Romania,
and the interest rate on all loans is now 5% per annum. Since under the
controlled price system in Romania the inflation has remained below 2% per
annum throughout the duration of the project, the onlending rates represented
a positive real rate of interest.
3.10     Cofinancing.  The need for cofinancing was envisaged at appraisal
be ause the Bank was to finance only US$85 million of the US$109.2 million
estimated foreign exchange cost of the project. Negotiations to arrange
cofinancing, therefore, started immediately following the negotiations of the
Bank loan. In May 1980 a cofinancing loan, amouiting to US$100 million, was
syndicated by a group of 43 commercial banks led by Centrale Rabobank-Utrecht,
Holland, and Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole-France. The Bank was
instrumental in arranging the cofinancing, of which the terms included eight
years maturity, five years grace period and interest of 3/4% per annum over
the arithmetic mean of the six-month London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) for
Eurodollar deposits. Consequently, foreign financing covered about 58% of the
project cost.
F. Disbursements
3.11     Disbursements were ahead of the appraisal estimate for the first five
quarters of the project implementation period (Annex 1, Table 4). They fell
behind the appraisal estimate between 1982 and 1985 Bank fiscal years, but
never below 80% of the appraisal estimate. The final disbursement was made in
the third quarter of the 1986 Bank fiscal year. Generally, actual
disbursements were relatively close throughout the implementation period to
the appraisal estimate. The final disbursement was made and the loan was
cinsed on February 25, 1986.

IV. OPERATING RESULTS
A. Number, Kind and Size of Subprolects
4.01     Broiler Breeding Farms.  Under the project 47 broiler breeding farms
have been constructed, each with 18 houses which include 36,000 young stock
and 72,000 adults. Parents of young stock are grown on deep litter. The
feeding and drinking systems are mechanical. The houses provide heat with
electricity until chickens have grown their feathers. After 20 weeks the
chickens reach the maturity stage when they are moved to houses that are
properly equipped for the egg-laying stage. The Romanian authorities have
accepted the Bank's proposal to keep the birds in the same unit from the first
day until the culling, which has resulted in the following advantages:
(a) labor cost to move birds was eliminated; (b) moving stress for the birds
was eliminated; (c) risk of infections during moving was reduced; (d) need for
new litter after movement was eliminated; and (e) energy was saved by bringing
bacterial development in the litter to optimum condition (see para 4.06).
4.02     The appraisal estimated that 240 million chicks would be produced per
annum, however, the actual capacity increased to 279 million chicks per annum.
4.03     Broiler production.  The appraisal plan was to modernize 20 existing
broiler farms and convert them to mechanized cage farms.  However, only three
broiler farms have been modernized, creating a total increase in annual
capacity of about 7,200 tons of broilers, less than the 48,000 tons estimated
at appraisal. On the other hand, 49 new broiler farms have been constructed
with production capacity of about 170,000 tons of broilers, an increase over
the estimate of 28 farms with production capacity of 110,000 tons at
appraisal. Altogether, the project increased the production capacity of
broilers by about 177,000 tons compared to about 158,000 tons estimated at
appraisal.
4.04     Poultry slaughterhouses.  The appraisal envisaged implementation of
15 new poultry slaughterhouses with a productioni capacity of about 112,000
tons in two shifts. Only 14 poultry slaughterhouses were actually implemented
with total productiun capacity of about 105,000 tons.
05     Under the project, the breeding capacity increased beyond the
incremental production capacity of the poultry farms. This has not caused
sig.ificant difficulties because the individual sector and existing
cooperative farms have been able to absorb the excess chicks produced.
B. Adequacy of Project Facilities
4.06     Breeding units.  After some experimentation with two-story buildings,
all breeding units were built as single-story, conventional brick buildings
with prefab concrete roofs. The width of the houses was reduced from 20 m to
12 m to improve the ventilation within each house. There is a central work
area; each half of the house is subdivided into six pens with a center aisle.
47 342



-12-
Standard equipment includes chain feeders and round drinkers. The feed going
into each unit is controlled by a scale. Initially, each unit had three age
groups, with an approximately 24-week age difference. Usually, the parents
are started in specially equipped rearing houses and move to the laying houses
at approximately 20 weeks of age. The growing houses (six per age group)
usually start with approximately 7,200 chicks (6,000-6,600 pullets plus 15b
cockerels), which are reduced by mortality, culling and selection to
3,500-6,000 female breeders plus 10% males at the time when th-y are moved to
the laying houses (at approximately 20 weeks of age).
4.07     Broiler production.  The adequacy of the cage system to rear broilers
has not been resolved unequivocally. During 1982 it became clear that the
investment and operating costs were significantly higher than previously
estimated and, in addition, there was a relatively large requirement for
supervision and maintenance by qualified staff. All this raised doubts within
MAFI whether it was justified to continue to implement the construction of the
cage system or revert back to the deep litter system. In fact, in July 1982
the president of BAFI sought the Bank's agreement to use the remaining project
funds for construction of deep litter broiler production only. However, by
August 1982 the view that the cage system was more advantageous was upheld in
Romania and they continued to construct the cages. The consultant hired by
the Bank for supervision of the project concurred with the Romanian view that
the cage system is more advantageous than the deep litter system for the
following reasons: (a) higher labor productivity; (b) lower energy cost;
(c) elimination of the litter problem and the ability to use the straw which
is thereby saved to feed ruminants instead; (d) less land needed to build
broiler production units; (e) better performance in weight gain and feed
efficiency; and (f) large complexes are easier to manage and supervise.
However, revised financial analysis of the two alternatives was not carried
out.
4.08     During the course of implementation some important improvements were
introduced into the cage system design: (a) the basic design was changed from
one of 4-tier compact batteries with manure belts to one of semi-compact stair
step (California type) cages with a dropping pit and manure scraper; and
(b) there was a shift from cross ventilation to longitudinal ventilation. One
of the main advantages was that stair step cages had more uniform light
intensity in all tiers and therefore helped to reduce the problem of early
mortality.
C. Bio-economic and Production Efficiency Parameters
4.10     Altogether about 40,000 broiler grandparents were imported under the
project in quarter-yearly batches of 4033 birds. The first batch arrived in
December 1983 and the last delivery was at the end of 1985. Each batch was
composed of 645 roosters and 2240 hens of White Rock and 242 roosters and 726
Cornish hens. The import of broiler grandparents under the project has
significantly improved the genetic potential of Romania's broiler population
to the point where the genetic material in Romania is considered to possess
the same potential as the best genetic material in the world and is now an
important exporter of breeding stock itself.
47 34Z



-13-
4.10     Despite the improved genetic material, the broilers' performance in
Romania has been deteriorating in recent years as a result of low protein
content in the feed. An analysis of the annual statist4.cs shows that the key
indicators for poultry production have slumped since the early 1980s. For
instance, average slaughter weight per head in Romania is reported by BAFI to
have fallen from 1.22 kg in 1981 to 0.94 kg in 1984. In addition, presently
the estimated feed/meat conversion coefficient is reported to be 3.1, with
average crude protein content of about 17%. In other countries, where similar
genetic material is used but proper feed is provided, the conversion rate is
about 2 kg of feed per kg of weight gain. Under the project, the prescribed
objective, covenanted in the Loan Agreement, is 2.3 kg of feed per kg of
weight gain (para 2.08). Covenanting such an objective was predicated on the
assumption that the broilers would be provided with proper nutrition, as the
Loan agreement states "the feed formula for growing broilers in the said
facilities will be adjusted and applied as and when the broiler growing
facilities included in the Project will start or resume their operation in
order to provide sufficient nutrition under economically efficient conditions
to obtain at least 1 kg of body weight gain per 2.3 kg of feed intake"
(Article IV, Section 4.01(a)(ii)). Unfortunately, the feed provided to the
broilers was deficient in protein because of a shortage of foreign exchange in
the country to import feed, and slower than expected increases in domestic
protein sources.
4.11     The average cost of feed under the poor protein diet presently
provided in Romania is about US$131 per ton (Annex 1, Table 5). With a proper
protein diet in the feed, the estimated cost would be about US$145. Hence, at
the present conversion ratio, the cost of feed is about US$406 to produce 1
ton of liveweight broiler, whereas with an improved protein diet the cost
would be only about US$333.1' In fact, under the target conversion ratio,
the proper protein diet would produce about 35% more broiler meat than the
poor protein diet, with an additional cost of only 11X.2' This implies that
with the given budget constraint on foreign exchange it is still more
profitable to provide the proper protein diet, because with the same
expenditure on feed about 21% more broiler meat could be produced.3-  The
break-even point of the conversion rate, given the cost of the two diets, is
2.544', which implies that at any higher conversion rate it is more
profitable to use the proper protein diet. In addition, increased protein
content reduces mortality, increases disease resistance, and allows for more
hatches per year.
D.. Environmental Effects
4.12     The project has not caused any significant impact on prevailing
environmental conditions. Facilities financed under the project were
1/ Deficient protein diet: US$131 x 3.1 = US$406.1; proper diet: US$145 x
2.3 = 333.5.
2/ The conversion ratio of proper protein diet is 1:2.3, or about 0.435 kg of
meat per kg of feed. The poor protein diet produces about 0.322 kg of meat
per kg of feed, or ratio of 0.435/0.322 = 1.348, which means 35% more meat
with the proper protein diet.
3/ US$131/US$145 x 1.348 = 1.21.
4/ US$333.1/US$131 = 2.54.

constructed and operated in conformity with the environmental protection code
of the country. All tha poultry complexes have complied with the law which
requires installation of separate water supply facilities. In the manure
disposal system, solid materials from the mechanized broiler production units
are collected and sold to livestock fattening farms as feed or to local farms
to use as fertilizer. Manure collected in the deep litter of breeding units
is also sold either for livestock feed or to local farms for use as soil
conditioner/fertilizer. Slaughterhouse waste is collected and p;-.ecessed at
rendering plants Into meat- and feather-meal. Waste water is pretreated prior
to discharge into municipal sewerage systems.
V. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Input Supply and Prices
5.01     Presently, the main constraint on the feed quality in Romania is the
shortage of protein, notably, fish meal and soybeans. In 1984, the feed mills
in the country produced about 7.3 million tons of concentrate feed, of which
about 2.2 million tons were used by the poultry subsector. However, crude
protein (CP) levels in the feed are about four percentage points below
optimumu. With improvement of the protein content in the feed, the conversion
efficiency for broilers could increase from about 3 to about 2.3. Such
improvement would result in a reduction of about 25% in the consumption of
feed, mainly grains, while the consumption of protein feed would increase only
marginally, by about 4 percent.-' Other benefits include an increase in
weight gain per broiler over a shorter period of feeding which would allow an
increase in the production intensity from about five cycles to about 5.5
cycles per year.
5.02     Generally, the present prices of the main feed components in Romania
are close to the border prices at the official exchange rate (Annex 1, Table
5), and the average feed price with about 17% CP is only about 3% higher than
the economic price in dollar terms (the domestic price is about 130.8 $/ton
compared to an economic price of about 126.5 $/ton). With an adequate protein
content of about 21.4% CP the present price of feed would be higher than the
economic price by about 4% (the domestic price would be about 145.1 $/ton
compared to an economic price of about 139.5 $/ton). Practically, these
differences between the financial and economic prices are insignificant in
ralation to price fluctuations in the world market. Though prices are fixed
in Romania, they were set in close relation to international prices.
B. Output Demand and Prices
5.03     Per capita consumption of broiler meat in Romania is already higher
than in most CMEA countries, except Hungary. In West Germany, Benelux,
Denmark and Austria the broiler consumption per capita is below the level in
Romania, but in the United States and Canada, it is significantly higher.
1/ The supply of protein feed for broilers would have to increase by 25%,
which constitutes about 4% of the feed components.
47 34Z



-15-
However, total meat consumption per capita in Romania, which includes also
pork and beef, is significantly below the level of all CMEA and Western
European countries, and the United States and Canada. Broiler meat is a
substitute for beef and pork, and for the given level of meat consumption
which exists in Romania it is likely to have a relatively high income
elasticity. For that reason all the broiler meat produced could be completely
consumed in Romania, though some small amount is being exported (about 20,000
tons per annum), partly on a barter basis and partly for convertible foreign
exchange earnings. The value of Romania's poultry exports in 1984 amounted to
about US$24 million, but it was not exclusively broilers.
5.04     The price of broilers in Romania reflects basically the border
price. It is a fixed price which does not fluctuate, but the 3-year moving
average price of poultry is within about 3 percent of the border price
equivalent.

47 34Z



-16-
investments, on the other hand, have fallen short in terms of expected
incremental meat production, which is about 30% below the projected amount due
to the low quality feed provided, which causes the slaughter weight of
broilers to be about 1 to 1.1 kg compared to about 1.5 kg per head expected at
appraisal.
D. Economic and Financial Rates of Return
5.06     The economic rate of return for the breeding farms component of the
project has been estimated at 4% compared to the appraisal estimate of 5%. It
is assumed that the required protein content in the feed for breeding is about
70% of that required for broilers, and that breeding farms are provided feed
which is relatively I ess deficient in protein than the feed for broiler
production. The main reason, therefore, for the low rate of return is the low
price of chicks. A higher price for chicks would result, on the other hand,
in lower profitability for the broiler production.
5.07     The economic rate of return for the broiler farms component is
estimated under the three following assumptions:
Continuing the present practice of low quality feed                         0%
Improving the feed quality by 1990                                         14%
Improving the feed quality by 1988                                         17%
5.08     The economic rate of return for the slaughterhouse component is
estimated at 33% compared to about 11% under the appraisal estimate. The main
reason for the higher rate of return compared to the appraisal estimate is
that the fixed price for dressed broilers has gone up.
5.09     The economic rate of return for the project has been estimated at
about 4% compared to the appraisal estimate of 12% (Annex 1, Table 6). There
is no significant difference between the financial and economic rates of
return on the basis of the domestic and border prices of the inputs and
output. The economic rate of return calculations are based on the following
assumptions: (a) all investments and benefits are based on constant 1986
prices. Domestic and foreign costs have been adjusted by the inflation index
in Romania and the exchange rate movements (Annex 1, Table 7); (b) the present
feed quality, which has been deficient since commencement of the project
implementation, would remain the same during the remaining project lifetime;
(c) the life of the project was assumed to be 20 years, with a salvage value
of about 30% of the original investment in year 20; (d) economic prices of
feed and broiler meat are derived from estimates of border prices and Bank
projections, adjusted to farmgate level, which were obtained by a Bank mission
to Romania in February/March 1985; (e) the estimates of the present conversion
ratio for feed and the average weight of broilers were determined on the basis
of the findings of the appraisal of the Fifth Livestock Project in
February/March 1986; (f) the operating cost structures for breeding farms and
broilers were determined on the basis of models prepared by the Agriculture
and Food Industry Design Institute (IPSCAIA) in Romania and Bank supervision
reports, but adjusted for the feed and broiler prices and the feed conversion
ratio resulted from the findings of the Bank mission to Romania in
4 7 3 4 Z



-17-
February/March 1985; and (g) investment costs and benefits from slaughterhouse
operations have been derived from the project completion report prepared by
BAFI.
5.10     The economic rate of return for the project would improve if the feed
quality issue would be resolved--if by 1990 - 10X, and if by 1988 - 11X.1
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
A. Institutional Design
6.01     BAFI was the borrower for the Bank's loan under guarantee of the
Socialist Republic of Romania. In that capacity BAFI was responsible for
project administration, while individual subprojects were implemented by IASs
and CAPs, after thorough appraisal by MAFI and BAFI. BAFI headquarters was in
charge of: (a) appraising all the subprojects; (b) approving all subproject
investments below Lei 70 million (about US$3.9 million)''; (c) coordinating
project-related activities with the different Ministries and agencies
(primarily with Avicola, the Poultry Department of MAFI), IPSCAIA, the Feed
Mill Trust, Romagrimex and research stations; (d) centralizing disbursement
requesta; and (e) project monitoring, including the collection of information
and reporting to the Bank. BAFI's branches had the responsibility to
supervise the financial and administrative execution of subprojects and were,
either together with specialized engineers from IPSCAIA or with the help of
their own engineers, responsible for supervising the physical progress of
project implementation. BAFI's performance in coordinating project
implementation was fully satisfactory.
6.02     Actual project implementation and work supervision was the
responsibility of Avicola. Avicola prepared the work plans and financing for
the investments and presented them to MAFI and then to the State Planning
Commission and to the Ministry of Finance for final approval. Avicola has
proven to be professionally competent and skilled in its tasks to supervise
and coordinate the project implementation.
B. Support Services
6.03     The main support services to the project have been provided by:
(a) the Pasteur Institute in Bucharest, which manufactures most vaccines for
poultry and other animals; (b) the Central Laboratory Diagnosis Institute in
Clinceni; (c) the Central Laboratory for Food and Feed in Obor; (d) the
Laboratory for Mixed Feed in Bucharest; (e) the various labs for sanitary and
veterinary inspection in most districts; and (f) the labs for feed quality
control and nutrition, which operate in most districts. The performance of
some of these labs and institutes, stch as the Pasteur Institute, has been
upgraded significantly because the project enabled them to procure needed
1/ See borrower comments, Annex 2.
2/ Investments exceeding Lei 70 million had to be submitted to the Bank for
approval.

-18-
modern instruments and material for their production technologies. As a
result there has been significant improvement in the vaccination programs in
Romania, which in some cases have become completely self-sufficient, and the
incidence of various poultry epidemics has been minimized and controlled
effectively. Other support services which had significant impact on the
project are the Research Institute for Poultry and Small Animals, the Poultry
,.3search Institute, and the Nutrition Institute in Balotesti.  The work of
these research institutes covers both genetics and improvement of poultry
nutrition which have resulted in successfully applying modifications of
various technologies.
C. Credit, Extension, Supervision and Recovery
6.04     BAFI supervision of project investments was satisfactory.  Each
subproject was controlled from the branch or sub-branch level, and BAFI loan
officers, often supported by BAFI engineers, carried out field visits at least
once in a quarter and prepared supervision reports. In specialized projects,
e.g. slaughterhouses, appropriately qualified engineers were used to supervise
or.going work. The financial situation of subborrowers was examined monthly
and reported to BAFI headquarters. Disbursements were made against
documentary evidence and physical progress was reconciled with payments
claimed.
6.05     Normally BAFI subbranches have authority to approve subloans up to
Lei 10 million. However, all the subloans under this project were larger than
the Lei 10 million limit and were therefore approved by the headquarters. The
processing of subloan applications, approval and distursements were carried
out efficiently and without delays.
6.06     Avicola has been providing the necessary extension services to the
enterprises involved in all the areas of veterinary assistance, management and
coordinating the technical assistance from the specialized support services.
6.07     Subloan repayment under this project has not been an issue.
Repayments of subloans for the slaughterhouses are likely to be abead of
schedule beause when profits exceed 6% per annum the subborrower is usually
requested to acc'lerate the repayment. However, in view of the estimated poor
financial perfo;mance of broiler complexes and breeding farms, recovery may,
in some cases, become problematic since under the existing circumstances their
cash flow would not generate sufficient funds for debt servicing.
D. Staffing and Training
6.08     BAFI staff who were involved in implementation of the project are
well qualified and effective, and Avicola staff are highly skilled and
competent professionals. Staff operating the project components were well
trained, and there are sufficient skilled staff with academic degrees and
training in animal and veterinary science. MAFI organizes seminars in the
var.ous districts for staff of the productiuo units, and some staff have
received training abroad financed under bilateral arrangements.

E. Accounting and Auditing
6.09     BAFI branches maintain well controlled financial accounts for each
enterprise.  All the accounting is mechanized and tie headquarters receive
coded and categorized accounts from the branches. The accounts are all
reconciled and synchronized between headquarters and the branches.
6.10     Auditing is cursory and of little value.  It is carried out by
inspectois from the Ministry of Finance and the Court of Superior Control.
The audit reports on BAFI provided very little meaningful information, except
that they confirmed that Bank funds have been used for the purposes for which
they were provided. The audited financial statements of BAFI did not include
detailed information of BAFI's performance such as arrears and collection
rate, amounts which are falling due, and other relevant informaticn, such as
internal control, status of foreign debts and the quality of the loan
portfolio.
F. Reporting
6.11     Reporting on project implementation was timely but very limited in
scope. Quarterly progress reports, for instance, only included information on
BAFI commitments and disbursements per subproject and have not really met the
intent described in Supplemental Letter No. 3 to provide the borrower and the
Bank with necessary information for identifying existing and foreseeable
problems in advance and for formulating appropriate solutions.
VII. BANK PERFORMANCE
7.01     Project formulation and obiectives.  The Bank had a secondary role in
formulating the project objectives and scope, which were predetermined by the
planning authorities as part of the 1980-85 Five Year Plan. The Bank's role
was merely to review the project concept and its feasibility on the basis of
the assumption that it represented the highest priority to the economy.
However, there was no substantive study which established empirically or
theoretically that Romania had a comparative advantage in poultry production,
or that investment in the poultry subsector was economically preferable to
investment in other subsectors.
7.02     The first Bank appraisal mission in August 1977 was critical of the
project design, mainly the broiler farms in cages, and rightfully recommended
to postpone the project by one year until more operational da a could be
obtained. The second mission in September 1978 recommended on the basis of
the pilot operational results of rearing broilers in cages, that the Bank
participate in financ.ng such mode of production.  However, the cage system of
rearing broilers has remained controversial."' In retrospect it might have
1/ The results from farms operating cages have not shown conclusive evidence
that the cage system is superior to the deep litter system.
47 34Z



-20-
been prudent to finance the broiler farms based on cage mode in stages and to
monitor the results of the first stage before the second stage was developed.
7.03     Project Rrocessing and conditionality.  The Bank realized that the
feed quality was an important issue which was constrained by the foreign
exchange shortage in Romania. However, Government insisted the supply of
protein feed would be adequate and refused any suggestions by the Bank to
include in the project provisions for supply of protein feed. Rather than
addressing the foreign exchange allocation issue head-on, it was decided to
try to remedy the situation indirectly by covenanting a technical coefficient
in the Loan Agreement which required the borrower to achieve a conversion
ratio of 2.3 kg of feed per kg of meat produced. This solution has failed
mainly because there was never agreement between the Bank and the Romanian
authorities that the importation of protein livestock feed deserved high
priority in the allocation of Romania's scarce foreign exchange resources.
Indeed, while it is clear from a sectoral point of view that the import of
protein feed would be highly beneficial economically, it has never been
demonstrated conclusively that this would be the best use of Romania's foreign
exchange from a macroeconomic perspective, given the country's overall
economic needs and priorities.
7.04     Implementation and supervision.  Supervision of the project was
adequate. Between 1980 and 1986, ten supervision missions were made. Since
1984, supervision intensity of the project was reduced mainly because the
physical implementation of the project was progressing well, and the Bank's
insistence on improving feed quality was clearly having little impact on the
foreign exchange allocation issue. Most of the missions also supervised the
other livestock projects, mainly Livestock II (Pigs) and IV (Cattle) (Loans
1669 and 1937-RO). While there was continuity of staff, the inclusion of new
Bank staff and several consultants proved effective and was appreciated by the
Romanians, mainly because various technical aspects were reviewed, such as the
rearing system on the breeding farms which resulted in significant
improvements (para 4.07), and genetic and nutritional issues which had
significant impact on practices and procedures implemented in the poultry
subsector.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01     The Livestock III Project has been satisfactorily completed.  The
facilities constructed under the project are all in operation and from a
technical poi,t of view, quite successful.  Th-e rate of return, however, is
unsatisfactory at 4% because of the present practice of providing broilers
with deficient protein feed. If supply of adequate feed would begin within a
year, the project rate of return could be reasonably acceptable at about 11%.
8.02     The project was not well conceived in terms of assessing the linkage
between the supply of raw material (protein feed), the need for foreign
exchange to provide it, and tht assessment of the relative benefit to the
economy from broiler production. The Bank accepted without sufficient
scrutiny the Government's decision to go ahead with the project as a priority
investment without making the commitment to allocate sufficient foreign
exchange and/or sufficient agronomic measures to increase domestic production
of protein feed to ensure that the project achieved its economic objectives.
47 34Z



-21-
8.03     The project was planned, designed and implemented with speed and
efficiency and the actual project cost has been practically the same as the
appraisal estimate (about a 3% increase in dollar terms). Control and
coordination between numerous implementing agencies was efficiently carried
out.
8.04     The project created conditions for modernizing the poultry industry
in Romania, which is now on a par with the most advanced countries in every
respect, including research, extension, production of high quality breeding
material, and the management and operation of the aspects of broiler
production and processing.
8.05     Although the broiler production facilities financed under the project
have a higher productioh capacity than the appraisal estimate, the actual
production is about 30% less than the appraisal estimate. The facilities to
that extent are underutilized. But the underutilization is related to the
issue of deficient protein feed provided to the broilers. If this issue is
resolved, the capacity utilization is likely to be acceptable.
8.06     There seems to be a significant imbalance between output and input
prices which result in remunerative operations of poultry slaughterhouses,
indicated by high rate of return, and nonremunerative operations of breeding
farms and broiler complexes indicated by unsatisfactory economic rates of
return. Prices have a limited role in allocations in Romania. Therefore,
breeding farms and broiler complexes which are subsidized by the Treasury also
bear the cost of its foreign exchange risk and debt servicing. Hence, despite
the high economic rate of return of slaughterhouses, the project as a whole,
under the present conditions, is deemed uneconomic.
