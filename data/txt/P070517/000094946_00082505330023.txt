EAST TIMOR
I)1LI COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT GENERATION PROJECT
A. PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES
Project development objectives and key performance indicators (see Annex 1)
(a) Project development objectives are to:
* Generate short term employment
. Raise urban incomes
* Build social capital through community-managed environmental
clean-up
(b) Performance indicators are in Annex 1, and relate to inputs and
outputs.
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION SUMMARY
Project Components
The project has one component, for labor intensive activities of debris collection and
solid waste management.
With a duration of five months, the project will be divided into three stages:
1.   A pilot stage involving one community in the most urgent area of Dili to establish
recruitment and related procedures and their effectiveness. This phase will concentrate
on the cleaning up of rubble and debris before moving onto refuse removal. It is
expected that the work will commence in accordance with IDA operational procedures
before approval of the project and would be eligible for retroactive financing.
2.   A second stage involving cleaning of rubble and debris from within some 25
functional villages within Dili. Rubble will be removed from street frontages and
selected public buildings after they are declared safe for employees to enter and work in.
Portuigal's Bombeiros (fire-fighters seconded to the United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET)) will be invited to check each building for
safety. For private buildings it is envisaged that owners may move material from their
properties to road side. Rubble originating from both public private buildings will be
loaded into handcarts and removed to collection points or transfer stations where it will
be broken down manually into chips for urgent repair of roads.
3.   When building-rubble and debris is substantially cleared from within a community
attention will focus on the collection and removal of domestic refuse. This will also be
taken to an existing community collection point and transfer station for separation into
5



aluminium cans, plastics, ferrous metals and biodegradable material. Cans, plastics and
metals will be sold for recycling or transferred to a landfill site where they will be kept
apart from other materials for environmentally sound disposal. Biodegradable material
will be composted at the landfill site for later distribution to house gardens in the
community.
Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project
Before August 1999 East Timor had a population of 800,000, approximately 90%
of which were living in rural areas. East Timor's per capita income was estimated in
1998 to have reached only US$430. Agriculture dominated the economy with 76% of the
national labor force involved in the sector in 1996. Subsistence agriculture dominated the
mode of production.
On 30th August 1999, 78.5% of the population chose to reject an offer of autonomy
within the Republic of Indonesia, preferring to prepare for a transition to independence.
The violence which accompanied the 30th August popular consultation on the future of
East Timor was accompanied by the displacement of more than 75% of the population
and the destruction of 70% of all public buildings. This has created debris in the major
urban centres, in particular in Dili which was the largest centre and suffered a great deal
of destruction. All government functions collapsed, including public services of which
refuse disposal was one component. The small modern sector which existed before the
ballot has also collapsed, causing a shock to labour demand, and the informal sector has
experienced difficulties in rebuilding working capital and reprovisioning. The United
Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor (UNTAET) is charged with preparing East
Timor for the transition to independence, including the provision of public services.
However, to date only a small nLumnber of civil servants have been recruited, exacerbating
the shock to labour demand.
Within the context described above, the most pressing need is to generate
employment for the large numbers of people in the main urban centers who have no
means of gaining a livelihood. Poverty alleviation through stimulating the local economy
is the principal purpose of this project. In addition, in the post-conflict traumatic
circumstances in East Timor, it is recognised that there is a high degree of social
disintegration. The potential for civil unrest remains high. There is therefore an urgent
need to assist in the process of rebuilding civil society. This project addresses this need
by fostering the participation of local community structures and empowering them to
organize and manage daily paid workers. While the project will, therefore, have little
impact on institution building at a central government level, it could form the embryo of a
future municipal solid waste management facility
The Dili district solid waste management system has ceased to function but was
equipped with the typical features of an Indonesian municipal solid waste management
service, including community level collection points and transfer stations, collection
vehicles and a large, managed landfill site. A rapid analysis of the current situation has
been prepared and measures required to meet future needs have been recommended by a
consultant engaged by the United Nations Development Program (UTNDP). The project is
6



consistent with the longer term options considered by the UNDP study but will focus
chiefly on the removal of the building debris that currently constitutes over 85% of the
solid waste prevailing in Dili.
Benefits and target population
The target population will be up to 600 of the poorest people in village
communities in Dili. Community leaders will identify and nominate for employment
those people from within their community who are most in need. Paying wages at a self
selection rate of IJS$3 per day will assist in achieving this objective.
Determining the rate of wage payment has been based on an assessment of
comparators as used by UNTAET. Because of the fluidity in wage rates and structures,
the wage rate of US$3 per day will be kept under review to ensure that parity is
maintained, and that wages remain as self-selection levels (the market wage is currently
assessed at around $4 per day). A contingency on movements in wage rates of about
30% of the project wage bill is included in the budget. Wages will be calculated on the
basis of days worked and paid in US$ or equivalent at the end of each week. Community
responsibility for keeping records of days worked and effecting payments will be
promoted under the guidance of, and procedures established by, project management.
Spreading the benefits throughout the community will depend on the capacity for
varied participation, or rotation of community members as determined by the community
itself through the project organizational structure. The project will also try to pilot
double-shifting of workers to maximise employment potential.
Benefits from the project will derive from:
* Social stabilization established by the provision of short term employment;
Injection of funds caused by wage payments into local communities;
* Public health improvements created by environmental enhancement;
* Community confidence in reconstruction efforts created by visual impact of
cleaning the city; and
* Social reintegration within and between communities initiated by community
cooperation.
Institutional and implementation arrangements
UNDP will implement this project on behalf of UNTAET. The UNDP country
office has been in existence since early October 1999 and while not yet fully staffed, is
expected to have significantly increased its operational and management capacity in the
near future. The office has already established an operational presence with procurement,
accounting and management procedures in place and linkages established with other
intermediate term capacity-building projects. This project will be implemented by UNDP
through its established operating procedures in full compliance with IDA operational
procedures, including monitoring and reporting on project progress according to agreed
7



modalities and indicators. There will be no acquisition of land for the project. UNDP
will carry out related studies if required on terms of reference acceptable to IDA.
UNTAET will maintain a full client relationship to the project with particular
responsibility for policy guidance and linkages to institutional building and civil society.
It is recognized that the project's success will be significantly determined by the
transfer of information to civil society. UNTAET will inform and advise on policy
developments as they affect the project. A public information program will be mounted
by UNTAET within each participating community early in project mobilization. They
will emphasize transparency in project management by itemizing terms of conditions of
worker selection, listing expectations on payment of wages, and describing a community
based complaints procedure. UNTAET will liaise with and secure the services of the
civilian police force (CIVPOL) and other corporate facilities as are necessary to ensure
the timely implementation of the project. UNTAET will also ensure that its Dili District
Administration identify, develop and maintain such solid waste transfer stations as are
established under the project.
A Project Steering Committee convened by UNDP and consisting of
representatives of IDA, UNTAET and CNRT will meet at regular intervals to monitor,
review and advise on implementation.
The Project Management Unit (PMU) will be located in UNDP. The PMU will
consist of the Deputy Representative, the Project Manager, Administration Officer and
UNDP's Operations Manager. The Deputy Representative will be responsible for
ensuring that the project is implemented in compliance with this document and that the
agreement of all stakeholders is maintained. The Operations Manager will ensure that
recruitment, records and accounting procedures are maintained. The Project Manager,
recruited and paid for by UJNDP through related project INT/99/705 Short Term
Vocational Training, will be responsible for all day-to-day management. Intensive
activity will be required in the first months of project start-up, beginning with the
preparation of a work plan for project implementation and including identification of and
a training workshop for Community Team Leaders (CTLs) and Community Team
Officers (CTOs) on all aspects of project implementation. The Project Manager will be
assisted by a national staff Administration Officer to be recruited under this project to be
responsible for the procurement, supply and distribution of materials and equipment to
communities; and training and management of CTOs in organization and management of
employees, record keeping and wage payment procedures and documentation.
To the maximum extent possible, functions will be devolved to participating
communities. The CTLs will be responsible for recruitment, setting priorities areas for
clearance, ensuring that work is actually undertaken and that minimum performance
standards are met. The CTOs will be responsible for: recording work done; maintaining
employment records including recruitment, attendance, payment of and receipts for
wages paid; deploying equipment and maintaining its working condition.

C.    PROJECT RATIONALE
Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
A range of'alternatives which would address the need to remove refuse and
building debris were considered by the Project Preparation Team which formulated this
project. At one end of the spectrum, the use of mechanical loaders and trucks to collect,
load and transport refuse and debris to a landfill site, and at the other, a labor only
scheme to collect refuse and debris onto street frontages for collection and disposal. In
adopting the recommended methodology, the Project Preparation Team took into
consideration the following factors:
* The principal concern to generate employment;
* The need to minimize expenditure on capital equipment in view of limited
maintenance capability, relatively high operating costs and sustainability
considerations;
* The synergy available through linking project activities with others, especially in the
field of vocational training.
Major related projects financed by IDA and/or other development agencies
This project is of a short term emergency nature, albeit with long term implications
and potential. I'he IDA Community Empowerment and Governance Project is active in
the rehabilitation of infrastructure and labour-intensive works, but covers rural areas, and
does not inlcude Dili. Other labor intensive work programs are non-existent. The
project is a bridging project which aims to generate unskilled employment as a safety net,
before the larger public reconstruction projects (roads, schools, clinics) start.
A related project which will be functionally linked to this project is UNDP's short
term Vocational Training Project reference number INT/99/705. The Project Manager
will be funded umder that project. Of six month's duration beginning soon, that project's
primary component is the training of unemployed people in basic reconstruction skills,
including metal fabrication and timber construction. The manufacture of hand carts for
use in solid waste management will be undertaken as a vocational training activity.
Lessons learned and reflected in the project design
In formulating the project, lessons were drawn from the crash employment projects
managed by the World Bank in East Asia after the economic crisis. This has been
particularly reflected in the insistence on self-selection wages to ensure that the poorest
workers benefit, and the use of community management structures for the project.
9



The Project Preparation Team drew excensively from experience of UN staff who
have operated similar schemes in Cambodia. To expand and verify the technical aspects
of the proposed system, a technical audit will be undertaken by an experienced
international expert funded and provided by UNCHS (United Nations Centre for Human
Settlements - Habitat). This audit, to be undertaken early in project mobilization, is
expected to provide useful inputs, especially in relation to environmental considerations.
Value added of IDA support in this project
IDA's initiative to finance this project from the Trust Fund for East Timor is
unique, as other sources are not currently available. IDA's experience in labor intensive
projects during the East Asia crisis will be of value in the East Timor situation.
D.   SUSTAINABILITY AND RISKS
Sustainability
The project has been designed to enhance community cohesion through
consultation with community leaders and employment of community members. As a
short-term safety net initiative, the project is not expected to provide sustainable
employment. Financial sustainability has been ensured through the employment of
workers by community structures rather than force account, thus avoiding the creation of
contingent liabilities on the recurrent budget.
It is hoped that the project will provide a basis for a longer term waste management
capacity, since community participation in environmental improvement is expected to be
an on-going feature of municipal services. The project will dovetail with the FY2001
budget for administration of East Timor at which time solid waste management capacity
is expected to become an ongoing function.

E. MAIN CONDITIONS OF GRANT
*  UNDP will carry out the project with due diligence and efficiency;
* and in conformity with appropriate administrative and financial practices;
* and with due regard to ecological and environmental factors.
F. READINESS FOR IMPLEMENTATION
The roles and functions of participating agencies and their civil society partners
have been defined. In summary, UNDP will assume overall management responsibility
in association with UNTAET whose mandate for civil administration and infrastructure
in Dili will be critical to the success of the project, in consultation with CNRT and other
civil society partners. This collaborative management structure is now in place, is ready
for project implementation and will be augmented by the Project Management Unit.
Project mobilization has already started under bridging finance provided by UNDP,
and it will be carried out in phases, initially in one village community in Dili. Full
project mobilization will be achieved progressively. Target mobilization dates are for
one Community Team to be operational by 20 March, three more by 15 April and up to
six more by 15 May. Under budget arrangements applying to this project Community
Teams will be operational until the end of September, 2000.

ANNEX 6
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement of goods will follow the Guidelines "Procurement under the IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits", dated January, 1995, revised January and August 1996,
September 1997,and January 1999. Goods amounting to an aggregate value lower than
$176,000.00 will be procured under the project. No consultants will be financed. The
project will also finance, during its life, operating, maintenance and repair costs up to an
aggregate value of $6,500.00 and the costs of supporting the project management unit up
to an aggregate amount of $17,500.00. The balance of the funds of $299,000.00 will be
used to pay for the cost for an Administrative Officer, Community Team Leaders and
Officers, and Contingencies as well as laborers (daily workers and builders). The
procurement of the goods will be done through international and national Shopping as per
paragraphs 3.6 and 3.7 of the Guidelines. A table with the goods to be procured and their
estimated costs is in Annex 4. The procurement arrangement are summarized below.
Procurement of Labor
Procurement for the above labor will be carried out through community
participation as per paragraph 3.15 of the Guidelines. As stated before, UNTAET, with
the UNDP, will run a prograrn for public information in each participating community,
itemizing terms of conditions of worker selection, listing expectations on payment of
wages, and describing a community based complaints procedure. The Project
Management Unit under the UNDP, through its community teams officers (CTO) under
the supervision of the Project Manager, will be responsible for the organization and
management of contract workers, record keeping and wage payment and documentation.
Community Team leaders (CTL) will recommend workers which will be contracted on a
daily basis from the most needy groups, from within participating communities.
Procurement of Goods
Procurement of goods will be carried out by the UNDP which has the experience in
the implementation of this type of project. Goods will be procured through international
shopping except for goods estimated to cost less than $3,000 equivalent per contract, up
to an aggregate amount not to exceed $45,000 equivalent, may be procured under
contracts awarded on the basis of national shopping procedures. The risk is considered
low, and there will be no prior review of contracts. There will be an ex-post reviews of
the at least 20% contracts. In addition, monthly reports will be required from the UNDP
which will include the monthly update of the procurement information.

Retroactive Financing.    As UNDP is pre-financing the start up of the project
activities out of its own funds, expenditures for goods and wages incurred by UNDP prior
to the signature of the grant agreement, but after March 1, 2000, in an aggregate amount
not to exceed US$50,000 equivalent, are eligible for reimbursement under the Grant.
Special Account.    In order to facilitate disbursements, a Special Account will be
established by the UJNDP in US$ currency with an authorized allocation of US$200,000
equivalent. For the purposes of this Grant, the U7NDP Contributions Account will be
considered to be the Special Account. Funds will be deposit with the UNDP- New York
who will make them available to the project account in Dili overnight. The UNDP will
submit replenishment applications when the SA is drawn down by 50% of the initial
deposit, whichever occurs first. In addition to the supporting documents being kept with
the UNDP in East Timor, UNDP will keep copies of all other relevant supporting
documents.
Statement of Expenditures (SOEs).   All expenditures will be disbursed on the basis
of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) with supporting documentation to be retained by
UNDP and made available on request to IDA during supervision.
