INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMDATION OF TH  PRESIDENT
TO THE EECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO BRAZIL
FOR THE ALTO TURI LAND SETTLFENT PROJECT IN NORTHEAST OF BRAZIL
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Brazil for the equivalent of $6.7 million for an agricultural
settlement scheme in Northeast Brazil. The loan would have a maturity
of 25 years, including five years of grace with interest at 71¼ percent per
annUMn.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of Brazil" (WH-210a), dated November 30, 1971, was distributed
to the Executive Directors on December 2, 1971. A country data sheet is
attached as Annex II. The report describes Brazil's remarkable economic
growth over the past few years and the policies which the Government has
followed in achieving this performance. The report also calls attention
to the large external capital inflow which was associated with rapid growth.
During 1968-70 the net inflow, after repayments on loans re-scheduled
earlier, amounted to $2.5 billion of which $1.7 billion consisted of finan-
cial credits with maturities of one to four years. The role of medium and
long-term finance was important -- development agencies contributed $690
million net (IDB -- $312 million; AID -- $278 million; and IBRD -- $98 mil-
lion), while suppliers' credits, including loans from the U.S. Export-Import
Bank, totalled about $200 million. Direct investments amounted to $270
million.
3.        The report points out that continuation of rapid growth in the
1970's requires substantial increases in external capital inflows.  There
is a good prospect that this capital will be forthcoming on better terms
than in the recent past. The Government has placed controls on short-term
financial borrowing and has made considerable progress in formulating in-
vestment projects suitable for external financing. These steps will result
in an expanded flow of suppliers' credits and project loans. However, the
gross external capital requirement cannot be met if external assistance is
tied entirely to the foreign exchange component of project costs. Although
the capital investment needed to support Brazil's economic growth targets
is substantial, the import needs of most investment projects are relatively
low, as Brazil's capital goods industry is already highly developed and has
proven its ability to compete successfully under international competitive
bidding.



-2 -
4.          Brazil's total external disbursed debt amounted to $6.6 billion
at the end of 1971, of which more than two-fifths consisted of financial
credits. Because financial credits include a large component of direct
investment and commercial bank working capital credit lines, they are
probably not highly volatile despite the fact that an appreciable propor-
tion bears terms of one year or less. Moreover, much of the increase in
financial credits has been matched by an increase in foreign reserves,
which are now equivalent to some $2.0 billion, representing six months'
imports of goods and non-factor services. Brazil's debt service ratio
on long-term debt, excluding non-guaranteed private debt, amounted to
16.9 percent in 1970. Although external debt management is one of the
more critical issues confronting the Government at high rates of growth,
Brazil should be able to service the increasing debt needed to support
its growth targets so long as the present high quality of economic manage-
ment is sustained.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL
5.          Since 1949, Brazil has received 42 loans from the Bank amounting
to $1,432.6 million (net of cancellations). Annex I gives a summary state-
ment of loans and credits, as of May 31 , 1972. Of the loans declared
effective, 22 have not been fully disbursed, and of those, disbursement
of 12 was behind schedule at the end of 1971. The pace of disbursements
has been accelerating, however. During FY65 to FY69 disbursements
averagad$10 million per year. They rose to $66 million in FY70, to $75
million in FY71, and were $98 million in the first three quarters of
FY72. I expect that the disbursement rate will continue to accelerate
during the next few years. Comments on the implementation of projects
and on disbursements are in Annex I.
6.          Brazil is the country with the largest share of IFC's commit-
ments.  Since 1957, IFC has made 13 commitments in Brazil totalling $62.3
million, of which $5.1 million has been repaid, $13.4 million sold and
$1.3 million cancelled. Of the balance of $42.5 million, $30.5 million
represents loans and $L1.7 million equity. A summary of IFG investments
is given in Annex I.
7.          Bank lending to Brazil has been very active in this fiscal
year. Loans totalling $437 million have already been approved. Loans
for a credit program to assist the construction of grain storage facili-
ties and for a Fourth Highway project should be ready for presentation
to the Executive Directors in the next two months.



-3-
8.          In lending to Brazil, the Bank is responding to Brazil's
demonstrated ability to absorb increasing amounts of external capital
that enable it to sustain a high rate of economic growth. In selecting
sectors and projects for lending, the Bank seeks to fill important develop-
ment needs. In the first place, the Bank can help Brazil to increase its
foreign capital inflow by associating Bank loans with sectors where suffi-
cient bilateral financing is not available and where the Bank's participa-
tion will help Brazil obtain such financing.  The Bank's recent and projected
lending for both steel and electric energy projects meets this criterion.
In the second place, the Bank is hoping to direct its lending towards areas
in which it can support the Government's efforts to strengthen institutions
and pursue sound economic policies. Such is the case with regard to in-
vestment planning and finance in the power and water supply sectors.
Thirdly, the Bank is stressing the selection of projects which will help
Brazil overcome the most critical constraint on economic growth, namely,
the balance of payments. This means support of export-oriented invest-
ments such as the MBR iron ore project or of import substituting industry
where, as in the case of steel, Brazil has a significant comparative advan-
tage. Fourthly, in selecting projects for financing, a concerted effort
is being made to identify projects that will foster the growth of the less
developed parts of Brazil, particularly the Northeast, and reduce regional
and other income disparities.  The proposed Alto Turi land settlement project
is an example of the last type of project.
9.          The project was appraised by a Bank mission which visited Brazil
in October/November 1971. Negotiations took place from May 26 to June 1.
The Government of Brazil was represented by Mr. Walter Ferri, Chief of the
Cabinet of the Ministry of Interior. Messrs. Zenolda Barbosa and Ivonilzo
Correa represented SUDENE and Mr. Valdecy Urquiza Silva, the Companhia
de Colonizacao do Nordeste (COLONE).
PART III - THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR
10.         Despite the rapid industrial growth in recent years, agriculture
still dominates employment and export statistics of Brazil. In 1970 agri-
culture accounted for 20 percent of Gross Domestic Product, employed 46
percent of the labor force and farm products made up 80 percent of total
exports. Over the past decade, growth of agricultural output averaged
4.5 percent a year and the Government in their plan for 1972-74 expects
growth to accelerate to 7 percent. Brazil is attempting to recover from
the unusually low coffee crop of 1970-71 (11 million bags) to an annual
production of 26-28 million bags. Besides coffee, the greatest imme-
diate gains in agricultural output are expected in the grain, soybean and
beef producing areas of the South and Center. An important contribution is
also expected from the expansion of the agricultural frontier, involving
new colonization in the Northeast, the Center-West and the Amazon Basin.



-4-
11.         The proposed loan would be the Bank's second to the agricultural
sector in Brazil.  A livestock development loan ($40 million)was made in
1967. After initial delays, the project has recently been progressing well.
However, in the course of appraising a second livestock project, we have
discovered that the Brazilian authorities have not been applying fully the
agreed formula for monetary correction of sub-loans. Further disbursement
of the first loan and the negotiation of a second are contingent upon
resolving this problem. Discussions to this effect are progressing. A
grain storage project responding to the sharp increase in the production
of wheat, corn and soybeans and involving a loan of $30 million is about
to be negotiated. We are also holding discussions with the Brazilians about
financial assistance to a program of investment in processing facilities for
agricultural exports, and about a settlement project in the Amazon.
PART IV - THE NORTHEAST
12.         The Northeast, with about 28 million people heavily concentrated
in the coastal belt, is the poorest region in the country and its economy
has been a subject of concern for the Government and development strategists
for decades. Following special attention by the Government to the region
and governmental measures for promoting investment there, the Northeast
has been improving its relative economic position. During 1960-69 the
regional GDP increased 7.3 percent a year (the whole country 5.6 percent);
GD? per capita increased 4.7 percent a year (the whole country 2.5 percent).
The census reports of 1960 and 1970 indicate that at a time when
there was some reconcentration of income in Brazil as a whole, income dis-
tribution in the rural areas of the Northeast improved. During the decade,
both agricultural production and the cultivated area in the Northeast showed
a 5 percent annual increase, concentrated in frontier states like Maranhao
(which registered a 9 percent annual increase) where new areas could be
colonized readily. The growth in production represented a real increase
in productivity per man-year, for the agricultural labor force remained
constant in the period 1960-70 and declined as a proportion of the region's
total labor force from 70 percent to 62 percent. Unfortunately, despite these
advances in the agricultural sector, rural income remain very low and much
more progress in urgently called for.
13.         Unfortunately, these recent improvements in the agricultural
sector have been accompanied by a deterioration in living conditions in
Northeast urban areas. Per capita income in the Northeast ($150 in 1969)
is still about half of the national average. Unemployment and underemploy-
ment is still about 1.3 million, or one-fourth of the labor force. The
stability of the rural population which resulted from steady migration of
the young from rural to urban areas, combined with the natural growth in the
cities has increased the urban crowding and unemployment. Although there has



-5-
been significant industrial investment in the region, new employment
opportunities have failed to keep pace with the growth of the urban labor
force. Urban poverty in the Northeast continues, therefore, to be a thorny
national problem..
14.         The Government  is making a strong effort to alleviate regional
income disparitires by redistributing income to the Northeast through its
taxing and spending policies. The mechanism of Federal Tax sharing --
which bears an inverse relationship to regional per capita income -- the
direct Federal investment program., the system of interest rate subsidiza-
tion and, finally the fiscal incentives scheme permitting Brazilian firms
to deduct up to 50 percent of their income tax liability for investments
in the Northeast, have been the principal vehicles transferring resources
interregionally. During 1970, the inflow of Federal resources, net of Federal
taxes collected in the region, was US$635 million equivalent and amounted
to 10 percent of the gross regional product, or about 40 percent of gross
regional investment.
15.         The Government's main attention at the present time is directed
toward improvements in the agricaltural sector.  Under programs mounted in
1970 and 1971 a substantial part of the resource flow from the South to the
North, which had previously been directed to industrial investment, is to
be channeled into agriculture and transport. This should enlarge substan-
tially the resource flow into the Northeast agricultural sector. However,
even with both agriculture and industry expanding very fast, the backlog
of unemployed and underemployed and the continuing growth of the labor
force are so great that migration to other,parts of Brazil, as well as
resettlement within the region and in the Amazon basin, will still be
necessary to ease the poverty problem in the Northeast.
16.         Several avenues of agricultural development are being followed.
Most important of these are Government efforts to expand existing credit
programs. However, this has so far assisted mainly the larger landholders,
and needs to be reinforced with an extension organization that will bring
to the small famer both credit and a knowledge of up-to-date agricultural
techniques.
17.         The Government is also studying the redistribution of large
landholdings, especially the large sugar plantations, and their replace-
ment with smaller farms which might be more intensively cultivated.
Progress here will be limited until more research has been done on eco-
nomic alternatives to sugar production, and the administrative and other
probleimis associated with land distribution have been resolved.



-6-
18.         Another line of approach in the Northeast in the past was
investment in irrigation projects. The Bank appraised one of these
in 1970, but found that the investment cost per family would be high
and the return on capital inadequate.  These findings created a signifi-
cant impression within the Government, and while some irrigation projects
continue to be pursued, they are being chosen more selectively than before.
19.         Finally, the Government is trying to accelerate agricultural
development in the Northeast by promoting the colonization of virgin
lands, both within the region and in newly opened up areas of the Amazon
Easin. A number of different methods of promoting settlement are being
followed. Over the past few years there has been a great deal of sponta-
neous settlement following the opening of new roads, notably along the
new Belem-Brasilia highway. Agriculturalists and land conservationists
fear that these spontaneous settlements will prove to have only a tempo-
rary prosperity, leading to rapidly declining yields and eventual abandon-
ment of the land, or its transformation into low yielding grazing areas.
Along the new Amazon highway, the Government has introduced limits on
spontaneous settlement, although it is doubtful that it can enforce them
once road access has been provided. The Government has started to
establish a controlled settlement near Altamira in the State of Para.
Each settler is given about 50 hectares of cultivable land and the Govern-
ment provides housing and amenities in well-planned residential areas.
Besides being expensive (over $10,000 per settler) settlements of this
type receive a high degree of administrative supervision and rely heavily
for their economic viability upon the settlers' capacity to achieve high
value cropping patterns. Settlement involving cooperative colonization and
colonization through private agricultural companies are also being tried.
But a new and highly promising approach to promoting the colonization of
virgin territories is that selected in the Alto Turi project. It represents
a practical low cost approach to the problem, somewhere between the highly
administered schemes mentioned above and undirected spontaneous settlement.
Should the project be as successful as is expected, the approach it represents
is likely to be followed by the Government on a larger scale.
20.         External financing agencies have not been able to lend as much
in the Northeast as they would have liked. Project lending has had to
be preceded by substantial assistance in project preparation, in many cases
with a long lead time. Considerable technical assistance in the organization
and management of project institutions in sectors such as agriculture and
education was needed. The large transfer of funds by the Federal Government
from the Center-South to the Northeast created a situation in some sectors
in which external financial assistance was not needed.



_7_
21.         Up to now the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and United Kingdom and
German external aid (particularly the first two) have provided the bulk of
external resources flowing into the area.  Since the early sixties, USAID
and IDB have made special efforts to develop and finance projects in the
region. USAID has maintained a large resident mission in the Northeast
geared to technical assistance and project financing.  By the end of 1971,
USAID has made more than $300 million of loans and grants for specific
projects in the Northeast. Its program is now being phased out. IDB
committed $220 million in the Northeast up to the end of 1971. Both in-
stitutions have concentrated their project lending in the Northeast on
road construction, electric pawer and industry.
22.         There has so far been little demand for Bank lending in the
Northeast because of the large role played by other external financing
agencies which offered abundant financing for all the sound and well-
prepared projects. The Bank did consider an agricultural credit project
but Bank lending proved impossible to work out in the face of the Govern-
ment's policy of providing agricultural credit at low interest rates and
without monetary correction. In the past few years, the Bank has financed
only one purely northeastern project, namely, a $25 million industrial
line of credit to the Banco do Nordeste do Brasil (BNB) made in 1970. At
the time that loan was made, the Government accepted the principle of
positive interest rates for industrial lending operations of more than
five years maturity. In addition, a substantial part of the second and
third highway construction loans were for highways in the Northeast, and
part of the 1971 education loan will be used in the region. In the future,
the Bank's efforts to promote project preparation in the Northeast should
enable the Bank to expand its role. In the next year or so three projects
located in the Northeast, are expected to be appraised. One would be a
second industrial credit line to BNB. Another future Bank project in the
Northeast would be the expansion of the port of Recife. A third would
be a water supply project in the State of Bahia. As noted below (paragraph
29) the Alto Turi project may lead to lending for a settlement project in
the Amazon region which would draw many of its settlers from the Northeast.
Additional educational projects in the Northeast may result from the survey
of the educational systems of two northeastern states that are being financed
by the Bank's 1971 education loan.
23.         A special economic mission visited the Northeast in January -
February 1972, with the purpose of evaluating Government programs and
identifying project areas suitable for Bank financing. Although its re-
port is still in preparation, one concluision will be that the Bank's
involv-ement in Northeast agriculture will continue to be limited by the
scarcity of sound projects and by the Government's policy of providing
agricultural credit at subsidized interest rates without monetary correction.
However, in addition to land settlement projects there may be scope for Bank
assistance to agricultural research, agro-industry projects and feeder roads.



-8-
PART V  -  THE PROJECT
24.         The project is located in the Northeast of Brazil, in the State
of Maranhao west of Sao Luis, the state capital (see Map 1). It would provide
stable employment and higher incomes for some 5,200 settler families. The
settlers would produce their own food and would also grow rice as a cash crop;
most of them would also rear some beef cattle for sale. The project would
include the provision of access roads and trails in the settlement area, the
construction of schools, a hospital and dispensaries, the establishment of
cattle holding grounds and of a research station and the improvement and
expansion of a sawmill. The project also provides for studies of rice,
beef and timber marketing for a survey of water resoruces and for the
preparation of a second phase of the settlement scheme.
25.         The project would be executed and managed by a newly established
autonomous company, the Companhia de Colonizacao do Nordeste (COLONE).
This company would be responsible for land surveys and for the demarcation
of individual holdings, for on-farm development and for the construction of
roads and buildings. During the project development period it would also
be responsible for organizing the research program and for arranging for the
studies included in the project. The proceeds of the loan would be made
available as a grant to COLONS by the Government and the Bank would have a
direct relationship with GOIDNE governed by a project agreement. The major
shareholders of COLONS would be SUDENE (the Federal Regional Development
Authority), the Banco do Nordeste do Brazil and the State of Maranhao.
The representation of these three important agencies in COLONS should
facilitate coordination in the project area. On completion of the project,
the State of Maranhao would become responsible for maintaining the roads
and SUDENE would take over the schools, hospital and the dispensaries.
26.         The project would rely, to the maximum extent possible, on self-
help by the settlers themselves. Participants would be given title to 40
hectare farms and encouraged to grow rice and subsistence products and to
expand gradually during the first five years into pasture and cattle raising.
The settler would be expected, without financial assistance, to move his
family to the project area, to construct his house, clear his land and
develop his initial cultivated area. He would be given marketing assistance,
including a guaranteed price, production credit for his rice crop and he
would also receive a medium-term investment credit for cattle, fencing and
pasture development.
27.         Farm credit for marketing and for investtment in cattle and
fencing would be provided by the Banco do Nordeste do Brasil (BNB) using
government funds through two cooperatives to which BNB would render
technical assistance. Borrowing terms would be similar to those applicable
throughout the Northeast. Interest on these loans would be at subsidized



-9-
rates. At present, loans are unindexed and bear interest running from
zero percent (for fertilizer) to 17 percent (for agro-industries);
livestock development loans are made at 7 percent.  (The rate of inflation
in Brazil in recent years has been about 20 percent.) The amount of
production credit would be limited to 70 percent of the value (calculated
at the official support prices) of rice stocks held by the cooperatives,
and medium-term investment credit would not be extended in excess of the
cost of breeding cattle and fencing wire. Thus, the use of this subsidized
credit would be tightly controlled and the risk of misallocation of
resources or uneconomic use of investment goods would be much less than
under a generalized program of subsidized credit. Moreover, Brazil, with
a relatively strong fiscal system, is in a much better position than a
country with weak public finances to pursue economic and social objectives
through farm credit subsidies.
Financial and Economic Benefits
28.         The estimated per capita net income for a rice and beef
producing family would increase at about 4 percent per year, which is far
higher than that estimated for the average rural family in the Northeast.
The net cash income for a family is expected to rise to about  $460 in
the ninth year of the project, which is about twice as much as would
be the case without the project. Progressive settlers who introduced
additional crops could earn larger incomes. The economic return is estimated
at 16 percent. The project would provide full employment of 270 days per
year for the 5,200 settlers, who probably now work about 150 days per year.
Altogether some 26,000 persons would benefit from the project.
29.         Because the project relies substantially on the settlers' own
labor, the capital cost to the Government per settler is only $1,700
equivalent. The cost to the Government is therefore modest; it is estimated
that from 1984 on, the additional revenues accruing to the Federal, State
and Municipal Governments would be about four times greater then the annual
project costs and that all project costs would be recovered by 1989.
Because of its low cost the project is intended to serve as a model for
a much larger settlement program in the Amazon Basin. The Government is
now preparing, with the assistance of the Bank/FAQ cooperative program,
another project in the Altamira area of the Amazon which may be ready
for consideration in about a year's time.

Cost and Financing
30.       The cost of the project is estimated as follows:
$ million
Administration, land surveys, extension            1.9                      a.
Road construction                                  3.6
Pasture research, training and other studies    0.3
School and health centers                          0.2
Forestry                                           0.2
On-farm investments and marketing credits  1/   3.1
Contingencies                                      2.2
Total Project                                  11.5
Interest on IERD loans during development          1.1
Financing Required                          12.6
31.       The project is expected to be financed as follows:
$ million   Percentage
IRD                                           6.7          53
Government and Banco do Nordeste (HNB)         5.0         hO
(of which:
Incremental marketing credit   0.9
Medium-term credit               1.5)
Settlers' cash contribution  1/               0.9           7
TOTAL                                   12.6         100
32.       The Bank loan will finance roads, health and education facili-
ties, expansion of the sawmill,studies and interest on the loan during
the development period. It is estimated that only 10 percent of project
costs represent foreign exchange expenditure. To make a meaningful con-
tribution to the project, therefore, the Bank loan would have to be
utilized for local expenditure, which is justified in the light of Brazil's
overall capital requirements (see paragraph 3). In other cases involving
local expenditure financing in Brazil, Bank loans have covered about 40
percent of project costs (e.g., highways, livestock). In the Alto Turi
project, the Bank loan of $6.7 million would amount to h3 percent of
project cost including also the value of the settlers' labor devoted to
project development not shown in the above table.
1/ In addition, settlers will contribute labor valued at $2.7 million
for development of the project.



- ii -
Procurement and Disbursement
33.       Contracts for constructing the roads financed by the Bank would
be subject to international competitive bidding. Al1 other procurement
would be on the basis of normal purchases from local sources of supply as
is customary in Bank projects of this type. The Bank loan would be dis-
bursed against 100 percent (excluding any readily identifiable taxes) of
the cost of: road design, construction, and supervision contracts (US$3.6
million); contracts for OOLONE, e.g. buildings and houses, vehicles and
other equipment; research and development installations and equipment;
materials purchased for schools and health centers; expansion of the lumber
mill; research staff and training; studies; and capitalized interest during
development.
Ecology
34.       Historically, forests have been cleared and burned in the coloni-
zation area; Alto Turi will be the first colonization project in Brazil
with emphasis on protection of forest areas and some economic exploitation
of timber. The Government has laws for preservation of national forests;
in the project zone, large blocks of natural forests equal in area to the
land parcelled out to settlers would be preserved and an in-depth study
of forestry exploitation and timber marketing undertaken. Retention of a
common forest reserve is regarded as a more easily enforceable means of
keeping substantial areas in forest than the alternative of larger indi-
vidual plots with regulations -- difficult to police -- limiting timber
cutting. It is planned that COWONE would make a survey of dry season
water resources and prepare appropriate plans for meeting future project
needs in the most efficient way. The Government has agreed to take all
reasonable measures to ensure that the execution and operation of the
project will be carried out with due regard to ecological and environmental
factors.
PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
35.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Federative Republic of
Brazil and the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between COLONE and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
There are now 22 effective Bank loans under disbursement and
these are proceeding without significant problems except for the following:
Loan No.
404     The Xavantes hydroelectric project was completed in early 1971,
(after a delay of about eighteen months) except for the instal-
lation of equipment for an associated transmission line. Order-
ing of this equipment was very delayed, and the loan is not now
expected to be fully disbursed until December 31, 1973, four
years after the initial closing date.
516     After initial delays due to marketing and organizational diffi-
culties, the livestock credit program has been proceeding at a
satisfactory rate. However, some problems have recently arisen
with respect to the calculation of interest on indexed principal
amounts during the grace period, which may result in further
delays in disbursement. The matter is under discussion with the
Government.
565     The Porto Colombia hydroelectric project suffered delays due to
changes in the project layout and designs. The dam axis had to
be shifted slightly downstream. The problems have been resolved.
The first power unit will be commissioned in mid-1973 and the
loan is expected to be fully disbursed by the closing date, March
31, 1975.
656     The Banco do Nordeste has committed this loan more slowly than
originally expected, mainly because of the availability of sub-
sidized capital (the so-called 34/18 funds) from other sources
to industrial companies in the Northeast area of Brazil. Since
the Government has recently reallocated 50 percent of the 34/18
funds to investments in infrastructure and agriculture, demand
through BNB for the Bank loan may increase as alternative sources
of finance become scarcer.
677     The Narimbondo hydroelectric project was delayed by foundation
difficulties which required deeper powerhouse excavations than
originally anticipated. The problem has been solved, but the
project is now slightly behind schedule. The cost estimates for
the project have increased, and the method of financing the cost
overrun is being discussed with the borrower.
755     Part of the school construction project is likely to be delayed
as a result of a review by the Government of the architectural
features of several planned schools and of delays in engaging
consulting architects. A new schedule is under discussion.

Loan No.
786     Delays have occurred in awarding the contracts for constructing
the new railway link for the IMBR iron ore mine.
787     The estimated cost of the project has increased, but a new
financing plan has been agreed with the Borrower.
