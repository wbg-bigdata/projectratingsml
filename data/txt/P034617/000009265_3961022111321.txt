MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALI
FOR THE SELINGUE POWER RFHABILITATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Mali for SDR 18.5million (equivalent to
US$27.3 million) on standard I)A terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance the
Selingue Power Rehabilitation Project.
2.    Country Economic Background. Mali is one of the largest countries in Africa, with
a surface area of 1.24 million km2  The population is estimated at 9.5 million in 1994, with
80% living in rural areas. Of the eight main cities in Mali, only Bamako, the capital, with a
population of about 800,000 inhabitants, is a major urban center. NIali is one of Africa's
poorest countries, with a 1994 per capita GDP of US$250. The economy is largely dependent
on agriculture which is the primary source of income for most of the population and accounts
for the largest share of product exports (primarily cotton). During the last five years, the
Government of Mali (GOM) implemented a wide range of economic and sectoral policy
reforms. The underlying objective has been to improve the competitiveness of the economy
and lay the foundation for the sustained long-term growth needed to help raise the standard of
living and alleviate poverty.  These reforms have removed bottlenecks to private sector
participation allowing market forces to play a greater role in the determination of economic
outcomes.  The impact of these reforms is shown by the improvement in economic
performance over the adjustment period. On January 12, 1994 the GOM, in consultation with
the other member countries of the CFA zone, decided to strengthen its adjustment strategy.
The fixed parity of the CFA Franc (CFAF) was changed from 50 to 100 CFAF per French
Franc.
3.    Sector Background. Mali's domestic energy resources consist of biomass (fuelwood,
charcoal, agricultural and agro-industrial residues), hydro, and solar energy. Presently, only
biomass for household energy and hydro for electricity generation are exploited on a
significant scale. The country's hydropower potential, based on the Senegal and Niger river
system, is estimated at about 1,000 MW capable of producing 5,000 GWh in an average year.
Of this potential, only about 50 MW (220 GWh) have been developed so far, at the Selingue
and Sotuba dams on the Niger River. Mali has no significant known fossil fuels and
petroleum product consumption is entirely dependent on imports (about 200,000 tons
annually). Final energy consumption is low and was estimated in 1992 at 1.83 million tons of
oil equivalent (toe) which corresponds to a consumption of 200 kg of oil equivalent per capita
per year. Fuelwood and charcoal represent more than 88% of the consumption, whereas
modern energy (petroleum products and electricity) represents less than 12%.
4.    Over the last ten years, the GOM  has streamlined its energy policy; its present
objectives are to: (a) evaluate and develop domestic energy resources; and (b) promote more



2
efficient utilization of all forms of energy. In order to achieve these objectives, the GOM has
taken steps to: (a) better control and manage its natural resources (wood) and promote
efficient wood stoves, (b) liberalize petroleum imports and distribution (which has already led
to substantial positive effects on retail prices), and (c) help promote the development of the
Manantali Regional Energy Project which is being implemented by the Organisation pour la
mise en oeuvre diu flelve Senegal (OMVS). This agency has already built a dam on the
Senegal river and is planning to complete the corresponding power facilities by the year 2000,
to supply Mali, Mauritania, and Senegal.
5.    In 1994, only 7% of the population had access to electricity (44,000 households).
Even in Bamako, the electrification rate was only 40%. From 1987 to 1994, electricity sales
grew from 150 GWh to 209 GWh with an average annual increase of less than 5%. There is a
considerable potential for electricity use, but the demand growth remains constrained by
limitations on the supply side (generation capacity and distribution network).
6.    The power system is comprised of an interconnected network with a capacity of about
70 MW and 10 isolated centers which are supplied by small diesel units totaling 10 MW. All
of the facilities are operated by EDM, a semi-publicly owned enterprise whose shareholders
are the GOM (97.2% of shares) and Electricite de France ([EDF] 2.8% of shares). The
Selingue hydropower plant is by far the largest plant in the country with an installed capacity
of 44 MW and an annual energy generation of about 180 GWh, which represents more than
70% of the electricity supplied by EDM. It was built in 1980, but recent inspections indicate
that some of its key components (dam and generating units) are in need of urgent
rehabilitation works. The proposed project will focus mainly on these works.
7.    For many years, the power sector was poorly organized and managed, with
responsibilities divided among several agencies: the Direction nationale de I'hydraulique et
de l'energie (DNHE) was in charge of sector development planning, building of major hydro
schemes, and of technical supervision of the sector; EDM was responsible for the operation
and maintenance of most power and water facilities, including those constructed by DNHE;
and the Office pour 1'exploitation des ressources hydrauliques du Haut Niger (OERHN),
another parastatal, was responsible for the Selingue hydropower plant. All of the electricity
generated at Selingue was sold by OERHN to EDM  at excessively high tariffs.  This
organization of the sector led to several problems, namely:  poor coordination between
DNHE, OERHN, and EDM for investment planning and system operation; important financial
resources drained from the power sector to subsidize other sectors; and inefficient operation,
monitoring, and maintenance of the Se1ingue dam.
8.    To address these problems and enhance the power sector management capacity, the
Government made two important decisions in 1993: (a) the unification of the Power Sector
by transferring all of the Selingue assets from OERHN to EDM; and (b) contracting out the
management of EDM to a private professional partner for a period of five years (Delegation
globale et temporaire de gestion - DGG). The Management Contract was signed in 1994 and
a consortium named SHEC, comprising Saur International, Hydro-Quebec International
(HQI), EDF International, and CRC Sogema, has been managing EDM since January 1995.



3
9.    Project Rationale. Detailed inspections of the Selingue facilities were carried out in
1993 and 1994 which highlighted important weaknesses that exist, in particular in the earthen
dikes of the dam. Worrisome occurrences have been taking place such as abnormal seepage
through the right abutment of the dike and through the dike itself The civil works experts
indicated that there has been a gradual degradation which, if not properly addressed, could
provoke a sudden internal collapse of the dam. This would result in the destruction of-Mali's
main power facility and possibly endanger the lives of people downstream. The studies also
concluded that there was an urgent need for a systematic overhaul of all electromechanical
equipment, because of poor maintenance. The proposed project will address these problems.
10.   While immediate priority is given to these rehabilitation works, other investments will
take place over the next five years including: (a) completion of ongoing operations to
rehabilitate and extend generation and distribution facilities in some isolated centers and the
distribution system in Bamako, (b) addition of 9 MW of small thermal units in Bamako to
provide back up during periods of reduced supply from Selingue (3 MW) and to fulfill
electricity demand expected to grow at an average rate of 6.8% per year during the period
1995-2000. Once the Manantali power plant is completed, these small thermal units will be
relocated to isolated centers, not connected to the national grid. In the longer term, the
development of the power sector would be based on the expansion of the transmission and
distribution systems to supply electricity from the Manantali power plant and possibly from
C6te d'Ivoire.
11.   Project Objectives. The main objective of the project is to repair and rehabilitate the
Selingu6 facilities to ensure that a major source of electricity supply is not lost.  Other
objectives of the project are to:  (a) maintain the electricity demand/supply balance by
increasing the thermal capacity of the system and implementing an energy efficiency program;
(b) improve the capacity of EDM to properly operate, maintain, and monitor its power
generation facilities, and (c) prepare a long-term institutional and regulatory framework and
implement it as of 1999.
12.   Project Description. The project components and base costs are the following: (a)
Rehabilitating the Selingue Hydropower Facilities (US$22.9 million) including: (i) repairs
to the dam itself (dike crest; embankment right bank and road superstructure; concrete
structures like the powerhouse, the spillway, galleries and drainage systems; additional
monitoring devices and instrumentation), (ii) repairs of the power plant (general powerhouse
equipment, measurement and control devices; filtering and cooling systems; overhaul of the
four generators, one every year from 1996 to 1999: turbines, alternators, voltage and speed
regulation, and monitoring systems); (iii) repairs of the transmission lines (restructuring of the
electrical protection system for the 150 kV, 30 kV, and 15 kV network; spare parts for the
Selingue-Bamako 150 kV transmission line and substations); (b) Maintaining the Electricity
Demand/Supply Balance (US$8.9 million) including: (i) an additional thermal capacity of
9 MW; and (ii) an energy efficiency program (reduction of distribution losses, efficient end-
uses, interruptible tariffs); (c) Strengthening EDM Management Capacity (US$2.0 million)
including: (i) a training program to improve EDM staff capacity to operate and properly
maintain generation facilities, specifically at Selingue; (ii) studies for preparing future power



4
sector development programs; and (iii) acquisition of equipment and computer software; and
(d) Preparing a Long-term Institutional Framework (US$0.4 million) for rapid and
sustainable development of the power sector in Mali.
13.   Project Cost and Financing. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$42.1
million equivalent, net of taxes and duties, including interest during construction and
contingencies, with a foreign exchange component of US$36.8 million (87%). Financing
would be provided by IDA (US$27.3 million), the European Investment Bank ([EIB] US$6.5
million), and EDM which would contribute US$8.3 million from internally-generated
resources. The project is exempt from taxes and duties, this exemption is part of the required
financial restructuring plan of EDM set up and decided by the GOM during project
preparation. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. A
maximum of SDR 1.8 million (US$2.7 million equivalent, or 10% of the total Credit) could be
used for advance procurement and retroactive financing of rehabilitation works and consulting
services.
14.   Project Preparation and Implementation.  The project was prepared with the
assistance of consultants financed under the ongoing Power II Project (Cr.1998-MLI). In
addition, an international expert in civil works engineering was recruited by EDM to assist
with the review of the civil engineering component of the project, and assess the technical
soundness of the proposed solutions. The expert will continue to assist EDM during project
implementation. EDM would implement all aspects of the proposed project; the long-term
institutional framework component implementation would be closely supervised by MvMEH.
A Project Implementation Plan was prepared by EDM and agreed upon by the Bank. Under
the Management Contract, EDM will continue to benefit from the permanent support of
managerial firms. Project completion is expected by December 31, 2000. Amounts and
methods of procurement, allocations of the Credit and the disbursement schedule are
presented in Schedule C- I. A timetable of key project processing events is given in Schedule
C-2.
15.   Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. Two main lessons have
been drawn from previous IDA-financed operations in Mali's power sector: (a) as a result of
the organizational framework in which OERHN and EDM shared responsibilities for the
Selingue facility, substantial financial resources have been diverted from the power sector and
basic maintenance and supervision of Mali's primary power generation assets have been
neglected; (b) EDM's management weaknesses remain, despite massive technical assistance
during the 1980s and two performance contracts between EDM and the GOM. These two
basic problems have been addressed as of January 1995 with the implementation of the
Management Contract for EDM and the unification of the power sector through the transfer
of Selingue assets to EDM.
16.   Rationale for Bank/IDA Involvement.  IDA's involvement is necessary for the
following reasons: (a) IDA has played, and will have to continue to play, the role of a catalyst
vis-a-vis the other donors in the power sector; this was illustrated in particular during the
discussions/negotiations which led to the 1993 restructuring decisions discussed above and



5
which, in turn, encouraged several donors to extend financing to the sector, (b) the technical
inspections of Selingue which led to the proposed operation were carried out in the context of
the ongoing IDA-supported Power II Project (Cr. 1998-MLI), and (c) the results of reforms
which are being implemented (Management Contract and sector unification) would be
seriously compromised if the main generation capacity of the country becomes totally or even
partially unavailable.  The proposed project is consistent with the Mali Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board in January 1995, which includes the
rehabilitation and maintenance of basic infrastructures.
17.   Environmental Aspects. The project will have a positive effect on the environment
since it aims at: (a) repairing and rehabilitating a deteriorating structure and strengthening the
security of the dam; and (b) contributing to maintaining Mali's hydroelectric energy capacity,
thus reducing the amount of electricity generated by thermal units. The project is rated B. An
assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed rehabilitation works was carried out.
The possible negative impacts are minor; they relate to: (a) possible lubricant spills when the
electromechanical units are removed from the powerhouse for rehabilitation; and (b) the risk
of creating stagnant pools in the quarries which would provide materials for civil works.
Mitigation measures were prepared and are part of the contractors' obligations.
18.   In addition, an in-depth study of the environmental impact of the dam since its
construction (financed by Arab Donors, KfW, AfDB, CFD and CIDA) was undertaken. It
revealed a noticeable positive impact, in particular on the development of agriculture and
fishing in surrounding areas. The study also showed that the construction of the S6lingue dam
has had negative effects and that, despite the mitigation plan which was prepared and
implemented in the early 1980s, there are still some problems which need to be addressed.
These include: (i) income losses that have not been fully compensated; and (ii) increased
incidence of some endemic diseases (malaria and schistosomiasis). The cost of addressing
these problems today is roughly estimated at US$2.0 million. As a conclusion, the study
proposed an additional action plan to mitigate these remaining problems. The GOM and
EDM, in consultation with all concerned entities, and with Bank assistance, will finalize this
action plan and implement it from the beginning of 1997.
19.   Participatory Approach. As mentioned above, the assessment of the environmental
impact of the dam which was carried out during project preparation relied on a broad
consultation of the population living in the Selingue area. The additional mitigation plan
(para. 18) will be finalized and implemented with the same method of large consultation. The
project also includes a component which would allow the GOM to organize consultations
among all stakeholders for preparing a new institutional framework to promote a rapid and
sustainable development of the sector.
20.   Project Objective Category. The project's main objective, which is to rehabilitate
the basic power generation infrastructure, falls into the Environmentally Sustainable
Development Category.



6
21.   Actions agreed during negotiations. During negotiations, agreement was reached
with the GOM on the following: (a) preparation by the GOM and discussion with IDA of a
revised institutional and regulatory framework for the power sector, to be implemented as of
1999; (b) annual pro-forma revaluation of fixed assets and corresponding adjustments in
insurance coverage, (c) annual audit of EDM financial statements as well as project accounts,
(d) actual implementation of EDM financial restructuring plan decided by the GOM in
October 1995, and annual review with IDA of EDM financial performance, tariff levels, and
adjustments needed to achieve financially satisfactory results, (e) annual inspection of the dam
to be carried out by qualified and independent experts and reports to be submitted to IDA; (f)
Project Implementation Plan (PIP) and project performance indicators; (g) employment by
EDM, under a management contract, of an independent professional firm to manage its
operations, throughout project implementation, (h) borrower's submission to IDA of quarterly
progress reports on project implementation, consultants' reports or studies financed under the
proposed credit, and a project implementation completion report within six months of the
project completion, (i) mid-term review by June 1998; (j) implementation of the environmental
mitigation measures for rehabilitation works; (k) preparation and implementation, beginning in
early 1997, of a mitigation plan to address the negative environmental effects of the dam.
Signing of subsidiary financing agreement between the GOM and EDM, will be a condition of
credit effectiveness.
Project Benefits
Repairs of the Snlingue facilities
22.   Electricity supply is of vital importance to any country's economy. The S6lingue
power plant provides 70% of the electricity supplied by EDM. If this production ceases or is
substantially reduced, all economic activities will be dramatically affected, which may
ultimately lead to a major crisis. The proposed project would prevent such a situation and
permit EDM, at a limited cost, to preserve assets, the value of which is estimated at more than
US$300 million. It would also avoid placing the security of people living downstream at risk.
If the dam is not repaired, it will be necessary to abandon it and drain off the reservoir.
Therefore, the electricity supply would have to come from alternative sources. These could
be: (a) a full thermal substitution (estimated cost US$185 million); or (b) a temporary thermal
substitution from 1996 to 2000 which would then be replaced by energy purchased from the
Manantali dam (estimated cost US$115 million). These alternatives are three to four times
more expensive than the proposed Selingue rehabilitation project. The proposed project is
thus the least cost option. Detailed assumptions used for this calculation are provided in
Schedule B. 1.
23.   If the dam is not repaired, the cost of the electricity which would not be produced is
estimated at US$22 million per year. On this basis alone, the Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
on the Selingue rehabilitation project, including the 3 MW of thermal back up, is estimated at
66%. This high return is not surprising since this is primarily a rehabilitation and not an
investment project. The Net Present Value (NPV) of the project is US$126.3 million.



7
24.   The best timing for undertaking the works was carefully assessed, except for civil
works repairs which are urgently needed for security reasons. The proposed timing for the
overhaul of the electromechanical parts is from 1996 to 1999 (one unit each year). The
comparison was made with a scenario in which these works are postponed until after the
completion of the Manantali project, in the year 2000. This comparison yields an Equalizing
Discount Rate (EDR) of 39%. If the delay is only one year, the EDR would be 21%.
Addition of the thermal units
25.   EDM plans to purchase 9 MW of thermal capacity of which 3 MW are necessary as
back-up during the rehabilitation of the Selingue generating units. If the remaining 6 MW
were not installed, important outages would occur each year during the peak season until the
completion of the Manantali power plant, and EDM will not be able to provide for any
additional demand. The only alternative for EDM customers would be to get electricity from
small individual diesel generation units at an estimated cost of US$0.60/kWh. Based on these
costs, the ERR for the additional 6 MW thermal units is about 65%.
Repairs of the transmissionl tnetwork protections
26.   Another component of the project consists of rehabilitating of the electrical
protections of the transmission network (cost US$3.1 million). These facilities, which are the
core of the electric system, are in poor condition and are responsible for low quality service.
There is no other alternative than to proceed with their rehabilitation.
27.   Project Sustainability. The sustainability of the project will mainly depend on EDM
ability to better manage and maintain the S6lingue facilities. Training was one of the main
issues to be addressed when the Management Contract was being discussed in 1994. As a
result, a comprehensive program for EDM staff was prepared by the Management Consortium
and is currently being implemented. In addition, a specific training component has been
included as part of the proposed project to enhance staff capacity to properly operate the
generation facilities, particularly at S6lingue. During the preparation of the project, the GOM
also made decisions for implementing a financial restructuring plan for EDM. This will secure
EDM future ability to finance the needed spare parts and services for proper operation and
maintenance.
28.   Project Risks and Sensitivity Analyses. Given the tight demand/supply balance over
the next four years, there is a risk of important load shedding during the periods of reduced
supply from Selingue. To avoid this risk, the rehabilitation works schedule (one out of four
units overhauled each year) must be strictly respected  This is likely to be the case as: (a)
EDM's experience in project implementation has been enhanced in the context of the ongoing
Power II Project, and (b) EDM's overall management capacity is expected to considerably
improve under the five-year Management Contract. Beyond 1999, when the rehabilitation
works are completed and the Management Contract has come to an end, the sound technical
operation, monitoring, and maintenance of the Selingue facilities will depend on the
sustainability of the overall improved management capacity of EDM and on EDM's financial



8
resources. The training program and the preparation of the new institutional and regulatory
framework, which are part of the proposed project, have been designed to enable EDM to
carry out these tasks efficiently.
29.   Sensitivity of the ERR to cost variations: Depending on the uncertainties on some
repairs to be undertaken, the cost of the Selingue rehabilitation works might increase from
US$21.7 million to US$24.5 million. With this new figure, the ERR of the Selingue
rehabilitation would decrease from 66% to 56%.
30.   Sensitivity of the ERR to delays in the works schedule: The rehabilitation work for
each power generating unit is planned to last nine months. If the work were to take, instead,
one full year, additional thermal generation would be needed and this would result in a
decrease of the ERR from 66% to 61/%.
31.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association, and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

STATUS OF BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALI
Note on Portfolio Implementation Issues
1.    Overall portfolio performance is satisfactory and is expected to improve further in the
aftermath of the Country Portfolio Performance Review held in Bamako in November 1995.
Action plans were agreed between the Bank and the Government for addressing generic as well as
project specific implementation issues. Two follow-up committees (with membership from all key
ministries and Departments as well as the Resident Mission) have been set up to monitor
execution of these plans. One of these committees is under the Prime Minister's Chairmanship.
2.    As of February 29, 1996, IDA had approved credits in support of 58 operations in Mali.
Forty-three (43) of these operations had closed, leaving the current portfolio with 15 active
credits. Undisbursed balance in the portfolio, as of February 29, 1996, amounted to about
US$218 million; and no new funds had as yet been committed in FY96.
3.    Out of 15 active credits in the current portfolio, there are no over-aged operations, and all
credits approved by the Board within the last 12 months have been declared effective. However,
three credits have disbursement lags of 50% or more. The characteristics of these operations are
noted below:
Natural Resource Management (Cr. 2370-ML). Cumulative disbursement lag: 52%.
Disbursements to date: US$4.63 million out of an approved amount of US$20.4 million.
The credit became effective on February 11, 1993, about seven months after signing. The
disbursement lag is due partly to overly optimistic projections on the start of village level
investments, which form the bulk of the project at the time of project appraisal. Village
level investments were only able to begin three years into the project instead of the two
years projected at appraisal. Since these investments were largely local expenditures, this
lag was further aggravated by the January 1994 devaluation of the CFA franc which
doubled local currency equivalent of project funds. The start of village level activities and
the increase in the number of villages to be covered under the project, agreed after the
mid-term review in November 1995, should result in a significant reduction in the
disbursement lag.
Mining Capacity (Cr. 2390-ML). Cumulative disbursement lag: 62%. Disbursements
to date: US$1.13 million out of the approved amount of US$6 million. This credit
became effective on March 22, 1993, about eight months after signing. Disbursements
have been slow due mainly to long delays on the part of the Government in finalizing
contracts concluded with consultants for the execution of two studies that are critical for
defining project activities. For this reason, the project was suspended in July 1995. Since
then, the Government has renegotiated the contract with the consulting firms and the
suspension will be lifted as soon as these contracts are formally approved by the Council



18
of Ministers, expected some time in April 1996. Once execution of these contracts begin,
disbursements should improve significantly.
Transport Sector Project (Cr. 2617-ML).   Cumulative disbursement lag: 92%.
Disbursements to date: US$0.84 million out of an approved amount of US$65 million.
This credit became effective on April 3, 1995, about nine months after signing.
Disbursements have been slow due mainly to severe procurement delays by the
implementing agency, the Direction Nationale des Travazux Publics (DNTP).
Procurement difficulties encountered by DNTP and other project implementing agencies
are being addressed through Bank's assistance in strengthening the Government's
procurement management capacity.  With this assistance and a number of recently
processed contracts (valued at about $25 million), disbursements are expected to pick up
by June 1996, reducing the disbursement lag.
4.    There are two outstanding audit reports, both for SAL I. These are in progress and the
reports are expected to be transmitted to the Bank by the end of March 1996.
