INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE EMPIRE OF ETHIOPIA
FOR THE AMIBARA IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following r'eport and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Empire of Ethiopia for the equivalent of US$ 17.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance the Amibara Irrigation project.
PART I - THE ECONO0MY
2.        A report "Current Position and Prospects of the Ethiopian Economy"
(AE-21) was circulated on November 18, 1971 (R71-257). The report of a
recent economic mission is nearing completion. A summary of recent econo-
mic developments is included in my report of 1ay 23, 1973, on a development
credit for an Agricultural Minimum Package Project (P-1196a-ET). A Country
Data Sheet is attached as Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ETHIOPIA
3.        From 1950 to the present, Bank Group lending in Ethiopia has
totalled $196.8 million, comprised of eleven IDA credits of $88.2 million
and twelve Bank loans of $108.6 million. Four loans are repaid and four
others are fully disbursed. Two credits have also been fully disbursed.
IFC has made four commitments in Ethiopia totalling $14.1 million. Annex
II contains a summary statement of Bank loans. IDA credits and IFC invest-
ments as of April 30, 1973, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
A description of past Bank Group activities in Ethiopia and projects in the
pipeline is contained in the Report mentioned above on the Agricultural
Minimum Package Project.
PART III - THE PROJECT
4.        An appraisal report entitled "Ethiopia - Amibara Irrigation
Project" (No. 70a-ET dated April 24, 1973) is being circulated separately
to the Executive Directors. A Credit and Project Summary is provided at
Annex III. An outline of the problems and prospects of the Agricultural
sector in Ethiopia is included in the Report mentioned above on the Agri-
cultural Minimum Package Project.
Background
5.        In the Awash Valley there are extensive tracts of potentially
arable land lying virtually empty. These areas are overgrazed by nomadic



- 2 -
herds that traverse them for six months of the year and, consequently,
are ravaged by wind and wrater erosion. With the planned development of
irrigation, the Awash Valley should become a major source of commercial
crops such as cotton and cereals, fruits and vegetables.
6.        A feasibility stud.y for a first stage of irrigated development
of the Amibara area and the adjoining Melka-Sadi area in the Middle Valley
of the A-wash River was completed in 1969 by Italconsult (Italy), a consulting
firm engaged by the Awash Valley Authority (AVA). This project was appraised
first in 1969 and again in 1571, following the completion of additional
studies. In consequence of a Government decision in November 1972 to exclude
the Melka-Sadi area from the project proposed to be financed by IDA, another
Bank mission visited Ethiop-ia in December 1972 to make necessary revisions
to the project.
7.        Negotiations for the credit took place in Washington, D.C. from
March 26 to April 3, 1973. The Ethiopian delegation was led by H.E. Ato
Tesfa Bushen, Mlnister of S       Ytte, NLnistry of Agriculture, assisted by H.E.
Ato Assefa Defaye, General 1ranager, AVA; Ato Ke?'yalew Achamyeleh, Chief Engi-
neer, AVA, Ato Assefa Biru, Lawyer, AVA, and Ato Tefera Wolde-Semait, Finan-
cial and Economic Counselor, Bnbassy of Ethiopia, Washington.
The Proect Area
8.        The project area is located in the central part of eastern Ethiopia
about 175 km east of Addis Ababa. The Amibara Plain, on the eastern bank of
the river and totalling about 10,000 ha net, has been selected for develop-
ment under the project at this time. With the exception of some 2,500 ha
irrigated by pumping from the river, most of this land is savannah or
covered by scrub. The upstream Melka-Sadi area of about 1,600 ha net has
been leased by AVA for separate development to Malka-Sadi Agricultural
Estate Share Company (MAESCO), an enterprise in which the Agricultural and
Industrial Development Bank (AIDB) and expatriates participate. A second
stage of development in this area may include the Bolhamo Plain on the western
bank and the Angelele Plain downstream of Amibara, totalling about 10,000 ha.
9.        Except for the labor force of three existing concessionaires, the
AVA settlement and the Melka Warer Agricultural Research Station, the popu-
lation consists of about 1,000 nomadic Afar families who occupy the project
area for about six months of each year and graze some 12,000 head of live-
stock. A further 5CO families with some 6,000 livestock inhabit intermittently
the adjoining Melka-Sadi area, now under development.
10.       In the project area large scale settlement of Afars is not practi-
cable because of their reluctance to change from a nomadic way of life to
settled farming. Settlement is also subject to constraints due to AVA's
limited capacity at present to train the settlers and provide supporting
services. The aovernment therefore proposes to limit settlement under the
project to some 800 Afar families (about 4,000 people) on a 2,000 ha pilot
scheme (20 percent of the project area) to test the possibility of further
settlement. About 600 ha in the area earmarked for the pilot scheme are
already under cultivation by AVA's own forces and a first group of 67 Afar
families, each cultivating a holding of 2.5 ha under AVA supervision. The



possibility of settling farmers from the highlands was considered but in
view of their lack of inclination to settle in the harsh, arid Awash Valley
among alien nomadic people, it was not considered practicable. High-
landers come down for several months to work on the existing planta-
tions and then return to their homes in the highlands with accumulated
wages. However, since the constraints will be lessened as experience
is gained, Government expects to devote a higher proportion of any
future project area to settlement and AVA has agreed to instruct the
consultants to be employed under the project to conduct their investi-
gations for the next phase of the project in the Bolhamo-Angelele area
Drimarily on the basis of settlement or smallholdings.
11.       The balance of the project land, except for 400 ha set aside for
the Melka Warer Agricultural Research station, would be leased as farm con-
cessions. The farming concessions (total area 1O,300 ha), occupied for the
past years under letters of intent that are subject to conversion to lease
agreements when permanent irrigation facilities shall have been provided by
AVA, are operated by groups of Ethiopian agricultural graduates. They com-
prise two farms of 500 ha each (the partnerships consisting of three and
four members, respectively) and one farm of 300 ha, where the partnership
consists of three members. Originally AVA intended to adopt a standard size
of 1,000 ha for concessions but following the successful start made by
these first concessionaires AVA has decided to reduce the size to an average
of about 200 ha. This would spread the benefits of development more widely.
However, the three existing concessions will remain unaltered in size, in
view of Governrment's prior undertakings to the concessionaires and the invest-
ments they have already made in good faith. AVA will continue to grant con-
cessions only to groups of 3 or more individuals, or to share companies,
for which the legal minimum number of shareholders is 5. There would there--
fore be a total of about 34 concessions, involving about 100 - 150 parti-
cipants. AVA intends to advertise for applicants for the new concessions
shortly. In order to ensure that future concessionaires would possess the
same capacity to bring about rapid and successful agricultural development
as is being demonstrated by the members of the three pioneer groups, assur-
ances were obtained during negotiations that AVA would adopt criteria satis-
factory to IDA to evaluate applicantst technical, administrative and finan-
cial suitability.
12.      Grazing land for the Afars displaced by the project would be pro-
vided in the adjoining Alledeghi Plain to the east of the project, wlhere
year-roundl watering points are being opened by the AVA. During the con-
struction phase and development of these watering points, corridors across
the project area will be kept open bY AVA so that Afar herds have access to
the Awash River. During negotiations AVA indicated that other areas in the
Awash Valley to be selected in consultation with the Association, may also
be utilized for relocation of the displaced Afars. It is expected that the
provision of these watering points, the creation of new employment oppor-
tunities under the project and the settlement scheme would provide adequately
for the Afars whose livelihood would be affected by the development of the
project.



13.       The project area has good road and rail communication with the
rest of the country. An all-weather road runs to Addis Ababa and the Awash-
Tendaho highway financed by the Bank, IDA and Sweden, which lies about 5 km
ea-t of the area, is under construction. The railway from Addis Ababa to Dji-
bouti also serves tne area from Awash station about 5o km away.
The Project
l4.       The main objective of the project is the provision of gravity
irrigation to about 10,000 ha of mostly undeveloped land mainly for the pro-
duction of cotton. Fruits, vegetables and cash crops like groundnuts may
also be cultivated in later years. The project would include construction
of:
a diversion weir on the Awash River;
irrigation and drainage networks to serve 10,000 ha;
flood protection dykes;
roads;
on-farm development for 10,000 ha; and
service buildings and housing.
The project would also finance the purchase of operating and maintenance
equipment, farmn machinery and vehicles. A consulting firm would be engaged
by AVA, the implementing agency for the project, to prepare final designs,
supervise construction, provide technical assistance for operation and main-
tenance and carry out additional investigations and studies including a
feasibility study for a second-stage project. All project works would be
completed in five years with construction begirnning in mid-1973.
Description of Project Works
1-5.      Diversion Weir - Ihe Melka Tdarer diversion weir on the Awash River
would consist of a low concrete structure about 14 m high, fitted with crest
gates and incorporating a road bridge.
16t      Irrigation System - The main canal, 21 l1u long, would
take   water   directly from the weir.   Delivery to the irrigated area
would be by gravity through earth canals. The capacity of the main canal
will be large enough also to serve the Bolhamo and Angelele Plains when
they are brough-t under irrigation in the second stage of development.
17.        Drainage Network - The main drains 47 km in total length and an
open drainage network would remove excess rain and irrigation water from
the area.  Drainage waters would    flow    by   gravity to the Cadda Billen
Swamp.
18.      On the basis of present knowledge of ground water levels and soil
permeability, it is possible that, after about five years of irrigation,
tile drainage for water table control may have to be installed. The timing
and area to be served by tile drains wouldi be determined by drainage in-
vestigations and water table monitoring initiated under the project. The
cost involved would be about US$3.3 million (at 1972 prices) and it has



-5-
been included in the economic analysis. The construction would be spread
over Live years and if required the cost could be included as part of the
second-stage project. However, assurances have been obtained during
negotiations that should other sources of financing not become available
the Government would bear the cost of installing tile drainage.
19.       Flood Protection Dyies  - The project area is subject to annual
flooding.  A 37 km western dyke, to be constructed along the river, would
protect the project area from flooding by the Awash River and its tribu-
taries. An eastern dyke of about 22 km, to be constructed along the escarp-
ment, would protect the project from run-off from the Alledeghi Plain.
20.       Roads  - Approximately l00 km of principal roads, including the
link to the Awash-Tendaho highway and 100 km of service roads along the
main canals and drains would be constructed under the project. In addition,
about 100 km of unsurfaced tracks would be constructed as part of the
tertiary irrigation network.
21.       On-farm development  - These works would include field canals
the drains, small structures, land clearing, stone removal and land levelling.
Some on-farm works have already been done by AVA, the research station and
the concessionaires over about 2,500 ha. Most of these works, however, would
have to be adapted to the new irrigation layout.
22.       Buildings and Housing  - The project would finance construction
of project headquarters, a workshop, stores and 23 staff houses and related
facilities for the project authority, the research station and the
consultants.
23.       Water Supply, Demand and Quality - The project would be dependent
for water supply on the flow of the Awash River which is regulated by the
Koka Dam and hydroelectric plant in the upper Awash Valley under the Ethio-
pian Electric Light and Power Authority (EELPA'). The availability of water
in the project area would also be affected by depletion of Awash River water
discharged from the Koka Dam by existing upstream users (the Wonji Sugar
Plantation and a few other concessions irrigating an area of about 2,6000 ha).
As a result of controls on river flaw exercised by EELPA, the dry season
flaws have increased and intensity of floods has lessened. According to
estimates, the Awash regulated flow would be adequate to meet irrigation
requirements of upstream users, the project area and the proposed second-
stage development. Only minor deficits in severe drought years are expected.
Comprehensive testing of water samples has indicated that the quality of
water supply will be satisfactory for sustained irrigation under conditions
of adequate leaching and drainage.
24.       The Government has agreed that EELPA, to the extent possible
without adversely affecting its overall capacity to meet the demand for
power, would insure that the flow of water in the Awash River would not be
depleted below the minimum that is required for the Project as a result of
any other requirement. The Government has further agreed that AVA would
promptly determine the diversion requirements of users of waters of the
Awash for irrigation and, that EELPA would give AVA an undertaking within



- 6 -
12 months of the date of the Credit Agreement that, subject to the availa-
bility of alternative generating capacity, it shall release from the Koka
Dam, during drought periods, a minimum amount of water sufficient to cover
the irrigation requirements of all downstream users.
25.        Cost Estimates - Total project costs (excluding customs duties
and other taxes levied on i,nports, totalling about US$0.1 million) are
estimated at US$22.8 million. Estimates for civil works and on-farm works
are based on construction quantities presented in the feasibility study as
modified during appraisal and updated by bringing them in line with 1972
costs.  The foreign exchange component, including contingencies, would
amount to US$13.7 million cr 60 percent of total project costs. This
amount was arrived at on the assumption that all equipment would be imported
and that civil works contracts would be awarded to foreign contractors.
The detailed breakdown of the cost items and contingencies are given in the
Credit and Project Summary at Annex ITI.
26.        Financing - The proposed IDA credit of US$17.0 million would
finance about 75 percent of the project cost, covering the entire foreign
exchange cost and US$3.3 million of local costs on construction contracts.
The balance of local costs - about US$6.0 million (including duties and taxes
estimated at US$0.1 million) - would be met by- the Government through
annual budget allocations to AVA. Proceeds of the IDA credit would be
channelled to AVA by the Government and recovered over 50 years including
eight years of grace. Interest at 7 percent would be chargeable; it would
be capitalized during the grace period. Out of the Government contribution
of US$6 million toward project investment costs, about US$1.1 million would
be in the form of a grant to AVA. The remainder would be made available
to AVA free of interest, with the principal repayable over 50 years including
12 years of grace. It is estimated that AVA would incur operating deficits
during the first 12 years of the project amounting to about US$1.9 million,
and Government would meet any such deficits through grants to AVA. It
would be a condition of effectiveness that Government and AVA have signed
a project financing agreement, on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA,
covering these arrangements. Retroactive financing of up to US$0.3 million
from the credit is proposed to meet any commitments entered into after
March 1, 1973 in connection with consultants' services and investigations.
27.        Procurement - All equipment and vehicles (estimated CIF cost
about US$1.1 million including contingencies) and civil works contracts
for the construction of the irrigation systems, flood protection dykes,
internal roads and on-farm development (US$16.5 million including contingen-
cies) would be tendered on the basis of international competitive bidding,
in accordance with the guidelines for procurement under IDA credits. In
view of the isolation of the area, the high costs of mobilization and camp
installation and the fact that no domestic civil engineering contractor is
likely to bid on any portion of these works, all these civil works and on-
farm works would be grouped into a single contract. Contracts for bush
clearing, construction of the link road to the Awash Tendaho highway and
all buildings and houses, the total value of which would be about US$1.6
million including contingencies, would be tendered locally since these works



would have to be completed prior to award of main contract and the amount
involved would not attract international competition. It is expected that
these locally-tendered contracts would be awarded to international contractors
already engaged on works in Ethiopia. Rough levelling (about US$150,000)
which would also have to be completed before award of the main contract,
would be done either by contract tendered locally or by AVA by force account.
28.        Disbursement - The proposed IDA credit would be disbursed in 6
years against the CIF cost of imported equipment (US$1.1 million), the foreign
cost of consulting services (US$2.5 million) and about 77 percent of the cost
of contracts for civil works and buildings. The estimated disbursement schedule
is given at Annex III.
29.        Environment and Health - The introduction of flood control,
drainage and land levelling would reduce swampy areas and so decrease breed-
ing areas for mosquitoes and snails, the disease vectors of malaria and
schistosomiasis. However, the irrigation and drainage channels to be con-
structed would provide an environment suitable for snails and control
measures would have to be undertaken. A study would be carried out by con-
sultants and assurances have been obtained that AVA would undertake the
reasonable control measures in accordance with the recommendation of the
consultants.
30.        AVA is fully aware of the importance of adopting satisfactory
standards of environmental health through the inception of development. It
had included in its lease for the Melka-Sadi area (August 1971), provisions
establishing the responsibility of the lessee for the maintenance of these
standards on its concession. These conditions specify- that the lessee
would provide housing, accommodation and adequate medical, sanitary, train-
ing and recreational facilities for permanent employees, and comply with the
laws and regulations relevant to soil conservation and improvement, erosion
and pest control. The lessee is also required to take reasonable steps to
prevent spread of carriers of disease made possible by works he constructs
and comply with AVA or Government standards for the treatment of effluent
to prevent pollution of the Awash River. Assurances have been obtained that
clauses similar to those contained in the MAESCO lease would be included in
all future project leases. With regard to the Melka Warer village which is
expected to be developed with the project, assurances have been obtained
that Government agencies would establish sanitation facilities, administer
water supply and other services such as police and education in this village
and any other villages that may be developed in the project area.
31.        Project Implementation and Management - The AVA, a public authority
set up in 1962 to administer and develop the natural resources of the Awash
River Basin, would be responsible for implementation of project works. The
AVA is governed by a Board of eight commissioners representing various mini-
stries and is directed by a General Manager assisted by a deputy and a staff
of about 22 professionals, including agriculturalists, economists and engi-
neers. The problems faced by AVA since its creation include shortage of
staff, inadequacy of funds and ineffective coordination with other Govern-
ment agencies. It has been heavily dependent on expatriate experts and
consultants. Government budgetary allocations have so far been limited,



- 8 -
mainly because of the lack of sound development proposals in the Valley.
Coordination with other Government agencies needs improvement. It is
expected, however, that as AVA undertakes economic development of the
Valley and manages to produce results, other agencies will take a more active
interest.
32.        The AVA has been getting assistance since 1566 from a UNDP/FAO
project which is expected to last until 1975. Even with this help, AVA
does not yet have sufficient experienced personnel for efficient implemen-
tation of the project. Consequently consultants would have to be employed
to assist AVA to design, construct and supervise the project and train
Ethiopian staff, as well as to conduct feasibility studies for the second-
stage project. AVA has recently received advice under the UNDP/FAO project
regarding organizational changes and assurances were obtained during nego-
tiations that within two years of signing the Credit Agreement AVA would
take such measures as may be necessary, after consultation with the Associa-
tion, to adopt a revised organization.
Recovery of Costs
33.        Project investment costs subject to recovery amount to US$18.5
million which would cover all investment except (a) farm machinery and
operation and maintenance equipment, the depreeiation of which is included
in the annual production and operations and maintenance costs respectively;
(b) the cost of feasibility studies for the Bolhamo/Angelele Plains; (c)
30 percent of the cost of all roads; (d) price contingencies; and (e) the
cost of tile drainage which, if found to be necessary, would be recovered
through a special assessment. Concessionaires in the Awash Valley now have
to pay an annual charge of Eth.$5 per ha for water rights and use of unde-
veloped land, and Eth.$15 per ha Tor land under agricultural use.   Under
the project, concessionaires and settlers would be required to pay, as soon
as land is irrigable, an annual operation and maintenance charge of not less
than Eth.$57 per ha and an assurance to this effect has been obtained.
With a view to recovering as much of the project costs as possible while
providing adequate incentives to concessionaires, an annual water/land
charge of not less than Eth.$300 per ha is proposed from the beginning of
the fourth year following introduction of irrigation. This charge would
be raised from the beginning of the ninth year to not less than Eth.$500
per ha, providing AVA is satisfied that the incentives to the concession-
aires could still be maintained. The annual water and land charge for the
Afar settlers is proposed to be Eth.$100 per ha from the fourth year
onwards following introduction of irrigation. Assurances have been obtained
that the above water and land charges would be levied on concessionaires
and settlers and that from the twelvth year of introduction of irrigation
AVA would review the adequacy of such charges at intervals of three years.
These charges would enable recovery of the project costs at 7 percent
over the life of the project, with the Afar settlers receiving a substan-
tial subsidy because of the relatively low rates they would pay.
Benefits and Justification
3 4.       The major benefits of the project would be to open up the Middle
Awash Valley and to provide foreign exchange savings by import substitution
for cotton and additional employment, particularly for highland and local
labor.



- 9-
35.        On the assumption that only cotton would be produced in the
project area, the net annual foreign exchange savings at full development,
on the basis of expected production of 10,000 tons of medium-staple cotton
lint per annum, are estimated at US$5.7 million. On the same assumption
and a shadow wage rate of Eth.$0.50 per day for unskilled labor, the
economic rate of return for the project would be about 16 percent. If
the cropping pattern includes some higher value crops, as is possible, the
rate of return would be higher.
36.        The project would create employment for the local Afars and for
underemployed workers from the highlands. The AVA settlement would eventu-
ally settle 800 families, who will work on the farms and the settlement
would also hire labor seasonally for cotton picling. At full development
it is estimated that regular employment for about 2,000 farm workers and
seasonal employment (3 months per year) for about 7,000 workers would be
created by the settlement, the research station and the concessionaires.
During the construction period about 750 workers would be employed on
construction of the project.
37.        Direct beneficiaries of the project include tie settlers in the
AVA farms, wage earners and the 100 - 150 partners in the 34 concessions.
For the settlers, the per capita income for a family of 5 is expected to
rise from about Eth.$76 to Eth.$294 at full development. For wage earners
now earning Eth.$250 per year, fuller employment resulting from the
project would increase annual income to about Eth.$310. Seasonal workers
would earn about Eth.$100. These incomes would accrue to the presently
under-employed workers from the highlands as well as some Afars from the
Valley whose incomes are at subsistence level. As to the concessionaires,
some of whom currently earn Eth.$12,000 per year in salaried employment
in their own enterprises, their incomes are expected to be between Eth.$
9,500 and Eth.$16,000, including salary provided for in-management costs.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
38.        The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Empire of
Ethiopia and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the
Association and the Awash Valley Authority (AVA), the Recommendation of
the Committee provided for in Article V, Section I(d), of the Articles
of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Develop-
ment Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft agreements reflect the normal pattern for credits for irrigation
projects.
3.9.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.

Ln No  523   Fourth Highway Project; US$13.5 million Loan and US$7.7
Cr No. 111   million Credit of January 15, 1968;  Closing Date:
December 31, 1973.
Project comprises:  (a) primary road construction - 303 kIn
of road between Awash and Tendaho, 118 kIn between Bedelle and Metu; (b)
bituminous surfacing of primary roads - 125 km between Nazareth and Awash
45 km between Jimma and Agaro; (c) consulting services for construction,
supervision and preparation of feasibility studies and review of design
for 500 km of high priority roads; (d) advisory services and training.
The project was late in starting because initial bids were high requiring
changes in specifications and new bid invitations. Subsequent progress
has, however, been good.  Of the three civil works contracts, two have
been completed - one a year ahead of schedule and the other about fifteen
months ahead of scnedule: the third contract is expected to be completed
at the end of 1973, about three months behind schedule.

an earth-filled dam on the Finchaa River, a tributary of the Blue Nile,
the purchase of three 33 MTW generators, the construction of an associated
220 KV transmission line and terminal substations, and a feasibility study
for the next major generation development project.  The project is nearing
completion and the powor otation commenced commercial operations with two
of the three sets cormaissioned in early january 1973; about six months
behind schedule.  The third unit was damaged in transit and commissioning
may be delayed by up to six months pending completion of repairs. Some
minor works are still outstanding but all of these should be completed
and the loan fully disbursed by the closing date; December 31, 1973. The
cost of the project has escalated by about 20%p over the original estimate,
mainly in local costs which will be met by the Borrower.

lines, and for an adecquate and reliable long distance network with
subscriber trunk dialing facilities between the five principal cities.
Overall progress has been reasonably on target. However, installation
of Live microwave routes has been delayed about one year. This is due
to the long delay in obtaining suitable consultants to work on the
survey of three routes and the need to review the capacity, feasibility
and other requirements of the other two routes to conform to the Pan-
African Regional Telecornrmications Recommendations, the study of which
was not, available unt-J-1 late 1972.

Procurement
Arrangements:            Procurement of equipment and vehicles (CIF cost
about US$1.1 million including contingencies) and
civil works contracts for the construction of
irrigation systems, flood protection dykes, internal
roads and on-farm development (US$16.5 million
including contingencies) would be made in accord-
ance with international competitive bidding. All
civil works and on-farm works would be grouped into
a single contract. Contracts for bush clearing and
for construction of a link road to the Awash-Tendaho
highway and of buildings and houses (US$1.6 million
including contingencies) would be tendered locally,
since these works would have to be completed prior
to award of main contract and the amount would not
attract international competition. However, these
locally-tendered contracts would probably be
awarded to international contractors at present
employed in Ethiopia on other works. Rough levelling
(US$150,000) which would also have to be completed
before award of the main contract, would be done
either by contract tendered locally or by AVA by
force account.
Consultants:             (a)  To carry out additional investigations and topo-
graphical surveys, prepare detailed designs and
tender documents for civil works contracts and
equipment purchases, and analyze bids;
(b) To set up a project field office staffed with
qualified experts under a project manager to manage
the project, supervise the execution of all civil
work contracts and on-farm development, provide
operation and maintenance and on-farm development
expertise, train counterpart Ethiopian personnel,
and certify applications for credit payments; and
(c) To prepare a feasibility study for a second-stage
project.
