East Timor                           Revised
Second Agriculture Rehabilitation Project
Environmental Analysis
A. Introduction
The proposed project represents the second installment of a $18.2 million grant committed by the Trust
Fund for East Tiinor (TFET) for the Agricultural Rehabilitation Program (ARP) in East Timor. Because
of the need for urgent intervention following the violence and destruction inflicted by the pro-Indonesia
militia in 1999, the first phase of the program (ARP I) was designed according to emergency procedures.
An environmental analysis was conducted for the project and was given a category B rating.
The estimated total cost of the second tranche of the program is US$9.8 million, of which US$7.8 million
would be contributed by IDA-managed TFET, US$1 million by ADB-managed TFET, and US$0.9
million (approximately US$450,000 a year, including staff salaries) by CFET counterpart financing. The
implementation period of ARP II is estimated to last 2 years. The program's Rapid Infrastructure
Rehabilitation component includes a US$1 million allocation for the rehabilitation of the Hera Fishing
Port, to be implemented by DAA under a separate US$1 million ADB-managed TFET grant. The
environmental assessment of this activity will be subject to the procedures and guidelines of the ADB,
and is not included in this analysis.
The present project, known as the second Agricultural Rehabilitation Project (ARP II), will finance
activities to the sum of an estimated $8.8 million. Even though the project status is still in emergency
mode, and many of the project activities have been covered under the earlier assessment, it was decided
that a new environment assessment be conducted both to ensure the environmental soundness of the
project and to incorporate environmental lessons from the experience of the first phase of the project.
Like the first ARP, this project is concerned with improving and strengthening the agricultural base of the
rural population who form the majority of East Timor. The project aims to achieve this goal by pursuing
the following project objectives - increased sustainable production, increased food security, increased
short term incomes. Towards this end, the project will finance the following four components:
1.  Pilot Participatory Development and Natural Resources Management
2.  Rapid Rehabilitation of Infrastructure
3.  Farmer Services
4.  Program Management
An environmental analysis of the project component activities was conducted during the Bank mission to
East Timor on 7 May - I June 2001. The assessment involved field visits to Tutuala, Los Palos, Baucau,
Aileu, Dili, Bobonaro, Maubessi, Ermera, Covalima and Oeccusi where the team interviewed farmers,
market traders and district agricultural officers of both genders. The assessment also benefited from
discussions with officials of the Forestry Unit, the Irrigation Unit, the Crops Unit, the GIS Unit, and the
Environmental Protection Unit.

B. Institutional Context
Under the current emergency conditions of East Timor, and the transitional nature of the East Timor
government, there is no satisfactory policy and regulatory framework for the management of
environmental issues. Even though UNTAET has passed a few regulations relating to environmental
management, they are difficult to enforce and need to be strengthened. This includes Regulation 19/2000
on protected places and species protection, and Regulation 17/2000 concerning the regulation of forestry
and forest practices. The 15 protected places designated in Regulation 19/2000, for instance, were
selected with weak consultation, and still lack a clear demarcation of boundaries.
The institutional framework is weakened further by the ambiguous and sometimes conflicting mandates
of the government departments. The responsibility for natural resources management falls under the
Division of Agricultural Affairs, of which the Forestry Unit is responsible for issues of watershed
management. Water resources management issues, however, fall under the purview of Water and
Sanitation Services in the Department of Infrastructure. The Environmental Planning Unit under the
National Planning and Development Agency has a mandate over the environmental sector.
Communication and collaboration between these departments remains weak.
It is against this background that the proposed ARP II project will be implemented. It is hoped that,
following the formation of a genuine East Timor government after the elections in August 2001, greater
attention will be given to strengthening the governance of the environment sector. The Bank may wish to
support this process through the provision of greater analytical and advisory assistance.
Against this institutional framework, the Project Management Unit shoulders a particularly heavy
responsibility to ensure that the overall environmental performance of the project is satisfactory. The
sections below present the environmental issues related to the different components of the project.
C. Environmental Analysis
Component 1: Pilot Participatory Development and Natural Resources Management
This component will pilot an approach to increase the resilience of poor farming communities to external
shocks (economic, market, climatic).  The component would be tested initially in about 12 villages
(sucos) in Baucau, Covalima, Dili, Lautem, Liquica, and Manufahi, with the potential for expansion to 30
sucos. The component would seek to strengthen traditional self-reliance groups and render them less
dependent on external assistance. It would also help community groups be less vulnerable to times of
scarcity and external factors by, inter alia, improving the management of their natural resource base and
diversifying their sources of income. The menu of activities - primarily related to natural resource
management - would be designed so as to benefit large sections of the community and involve the
poorest and most vulnerable (e.g. women). Activities under this menu are small in scale and may include
community nurseries, community woodlots and agroforestry, seed storage, water retention facilities,
aquaculture, and community living fences.
Because of the small village scale of these activities, the environmental impact in the short term is not
expected to be significant. As a guide, the Environment Protection Unit has advised that the project
should ensure that the scale of individual activities do not exceed the amount identified in the "List of
Activities Requiring Environmental Impact Assessment under Regulation 51/1993 of the Indonesian
Environmental Management Act." In addition, a screening process will be conducted by the PMU to
evaluate the environmental and social soundness of each proposed activity and to ensure that conflicts
over cultural property or known outstanding land claims do not arise. The screening criteria (to be
developed at appraisal based on well-tested criteria developed for similar projects in Southeast Asia) will
be included in the Operational Manual for the Component and the Project Implementation Plan.
2



Given that the activities will be proposed by community groups themselves, it is highly unlikely that they
will involve land acquisition or involuntary resettlement. However, a standard involuntary resettlement
and land acquisition clause will be included in the Grant Agreement to ensure that, should this become an
issue with any of the proposed community activities, appropriate measures of compensation and
rehabilitation would be provided to affected persons in accordance with East Timor's Land Acquisition
and Resettlement Policy Framework.
Since the Component is designed to benefit poor and isolated upland communities, an Indigenous People
Plan will not be required. The social assessment conducted through implementation should help identify
potential vulnerable groups in upland areas (such as in Lautem) which may need special outreach (e.g. in
the form of information provided in local languages) to have an opportunity to benefit from Project
activities.
Component 2: Rapid Infrastructure Rehabilitation
Three major activities would be financed under this component: community irrigation rehabilitation,
light-to-medium damaged irrigation rehabilitation, and rural roads rehabilitation. A fourth activity is the
feasibility study for the rehabilitation of major damaged irrigation schemes.
(a)    Rural Road Rehabilitation. The aim of this activity is to facilitate the transport of agricultural
production to markets and to provide work opportunities for rural people. An estimated total of 1 00 km of
agriculture access roads will be repaired and maintained through community participation. This activity is
not expected to produce significant negative environmental impacts as it involves the rehabilitation of
existing unpaved roads, without any lengthening or enlargement of alignment, by local populations using
hand tools and hand handled materials.
(b)    Community Irrigation Rehabilitation. This activity involves the rehabilitation of small scale
irrigation schemes through community participation. An estimated 2,100 ha of sawah lands are expected
to be irrigated through this means. The community, in addition, will be organized and trained to operate
and maintain the schemes. Any potential environmental impact arising from this activity is expected to be
local and temporary. This includes dust generation, local turbidity of watercourses and localized
downstream erosion arising from river diversion. The PMU, through its interaction with the community,
should provide information on environmental best practices and preventive measures for this activity.
(c)    Light-to-Medium Damaged Irrigation Rehabilitation. Civil work activities will be employed in
the rehabilitation of a total of 7 medium-scale irrigation schemes (average size of 215 ha each). These
schemes were selected after a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the findings of the 'Feasibility And
Engineering Study In Respect Of Rehabilitation Of Identified Irrigation Schemes In East Timor' by SNC
Lavalin which was contracted under ARP I. Absence of negative social or environmental impact was a
key criteria used in the original selection of the schemes (for other criteria, see activity (d) below). The
works will include the rehabilitation of main structures and canals, as well as secondary and tertiary
canals that would provide irrigation to an estimated 1,500 hectares. Upon completion of civil works, these
schemes will be turned over to the local water user associations for their operation and maintenance
(O&M). An estimated 9 water user associations will be trained to operate and maintain the rehabilitated
schemes. Table 12.1 provides a list of the irrigation schemes and a rating of the potential environmental
impacts for each scheme prepared by the feasibility study.

The potential environmental impact of these schemes are rated according to intensity (low, moderate or
high) and duration (short-term, medium-term or long-term) for the different phases of the activity. The
table suggests that the highest rating for the rehabilitation of the irrigation schemes to be moderate in
intensity and medium-term in persistence and occur mainly during the construction phase of the activity.
Annex 6.1 of the feasibility study provides a detailed description of the potential environmental impacts
for every phase of the rehabilitation for each scheme. During the assessment, the list of proposed
mitigation measures identified by the consultants (SNC Lavalin) in Annex 6.1 was not found to be
particularly useful as it did not distinguish the actions that required response from the PMU and the
actions that lie beyond the scope and ability of the PMU. This problem has been rectified in Annex 6.2
which separates the recommended mitigation measures to be taken by the PMU and those that require
wider govemment action. Annex 6.2 is included as Table 12.2 below, while Annex 6.1 is included as
Appendix I of this report. The PMU should ensure that the proposed mitigation measures are employed
by the contractors and responsible parties during these phases. The PMU will also include the monitoring
of these mitigation measures in the terms of reference of the supervision of works contract.
The operational phase of the irrigation scheme is not expected to produce significant negative
environmental impact as it would bring back water into previously irrigated areas. Since irrigation water
is generally diverted from river flows during and immediately after the rainy season, the rehabilitation of
irrigation schemes would not affect ground water supply but would only reduce the amount of runoff
water that goes to the sea.
The assessment also identified the long-term incremental environmental impact of the irrigation schemes
as a potential risk. This includes issues such as the encroachment of irrigated lands into nearby mangrove
forests and springs, contamination of ground water through inappropriate use of fertilizers, and the spread
of diseases such as malaria. This impact, however, lies beyond the purview of the PMU both because of
the short life-span of the project (two years) and the absence of policies and regulations related to
environmental control and management in East Timor. The PMU, however, should put in place water
quality monitoring to gauge the environmental performance of its schemes. Given the capacity constraints

of the PMU on environmental management, it is recommended that the PMU collaborate with the
Environment Protection Unit (EPU) to design and implement this activity. Against the absence of any
water quality standards in East Timor, the project could refer to the "Government Regulation of The
Republic of Indonesia Number 20 of 1990 Concerning The Control of Water Pollution" or any other
suitable standard as a guide. As far as possible, the PMU should involve the water user associations in the
monitoring through the use of proxy indicators.
Two of the schemes proposed for rehabilitation (Nunura and Batugade in Bobonaro) are located in shared
waterways with Indonesia. The World Bank Operational Policy on International Waterways (OP 7.50)
would therefore apply. However, the policy provides for an exception for "any ongoing schemes,
projects involving additions or alterations that require rehabilitation, construction, or other changes that
in the judgment of the Bank (i) will not adversely change the quality or quantity of water flows to the
other riparians; and (ii) will not be adversely affected by the other riparians'possible water use. This
exception applies only to minor additions or alterations to the ongoing scheme; it does not cover works
and activities that would exceed the original scheme, change its nature, or so alter or expand its scope
and extent as to make it appear a new or different scheme " (paragraph 7(a) of OP 7.50). This exception
has been granted to the two schemes on the basis that they are small (less than 2 percent of the size of the
Loes watershed), the rehabilitation would not involve major additions or alterations, and the schemes are
located in downstream areas. Hence, their rehabilitation would not affect the quality or quantity of water
flow to riparian water users in Indonesia. It is also unlikely that the schemes would be adversely affected
by water users in Indonesia, given that the intakes are located inside East Timor.
The Feasibility study also conducted a social assessment of the irrigation schemes. A rating of the
schemes was made based on indices such the level of poverty, number or beneficiaries, cropping intensity
and yield, willingness to contribute to the operation and maintenance of the irrigation schemes, etc.
Details of this assessment can be obtained in Chapters 3 and 8 of the Feasibility Study report. Table 12.3
provides the ratings given to the 7 schemes that will be rehabilitated under ARP II.

(d)    Feasibility Study for Major Damaged Irrigation Schemes. Under ARP 1, the feasibility study
for larger irrigation schemes included a reconnaissance level screening for three existing schemes with
heavy damage. The study recommended three schemes in Baucau (Seical Up), Bobonaro (Maliana I), and
Viqueque (Oetelari). The schemes will be assessed against the same criteria used for the selection of the
light-to-medium damaged irrigation schemes:
9



*  The rehabilitation of the schemes should have an economic rate of return of at least 10%,
estimated through an economic analysis, and a robust sensitivity analysis allowing for at least 10
% variation in production and input costs.
*  The rehabilitation should have no negative social or environmental impact.
*  The rehabilitation should have a high number of beneficiary participation and users willing to
take over responsibility for about 50 % of the costs of regular operation and maintenance.
* The schemes should have acceptable recurrent cost implications for the future Government.
ARP II has allocated funds to contract out this feasibility study. If viable, these three schemes would be
funded through a supplementary grant to ARP II, estimated at US$3 million. The Bank will review the
social, economic, environmental and technical feasibility of the schemes before a decision is made to
proceed with the investment.
Because of the larger scale involved in the rehabilitation of these 3 existing schemes, the TOR for the
feasibility study should include three items:
*  The site suitability of these schemes in relation to protected and environmentally sensitive areas,
international water issues, and social issues.
*  an environmental assessment that identifies the potential impacts during the different stages of
civil works and proposes appropriate mitigation measures, and
-  an environmental management plan that is compatible with the capacity of the PMU.
As for Component 1, the Project would not support investments in areas where there are known
outstanding land claims.
Component 3: Services to Farmers
Three major sub-components will be financed by this component: (I) Information to Farmers; (ii)
Sustainable Animal Health Services; and (iii) Pilot Agriculture Service Centers (PASCs).
(a)    Information to Farmers. This sub-component will provide information to farmers, and help
establish a Secretariat of the Consultative Group on Intemational Agriculture Research (CGIAR) in East
Timor. The aim would be to establish a basic foundation for a more effective two-way communication
system between isolated farmers, Government and NGOs which could result in a better channeling of
Government assistance, and help establish networks with centers of international expertise.
There are no significant negative environmental issues associated with this component. A fully functional
farmer information system, in fact, may facilitate greater environmental information exchange. In
particular, it may help to improve farmer response to potential environmental issues.
(b)    Sustainable Animal Healtli Services. This activity will continue with the vaccination program
started under the first ARP and establish a village livestock worker (VLW) system in all the districts. It
will also finance the organization of a cold chain system for the storage and distribution of vaccines.
There are no significant negative environmental issues associated with this activity.
10



(c)    Pilot Agriculture Service Centers (PASCs). The project will help consolidate and operationalize
3 Pilot Agricultural Service Centers (PASCs) that would have been established under ARP I. Subject to a
successful evaluation of these initial pilots, the project could help establish an estimated 2-3 additional
PASCs in other locations. The purpose of the PASCs is to provide farming communities in the area they
cover with the agricultural services they require that are not now provided by other businesses in the area
The PASCs would be legal commercial entities owned and governed by the villages or villagers the
centers serve. The centers will not require the construction of new buildings but the rehabilitation of
existing buildings. The establishment of the PASCs would make it easier for farmers to have access to
farm inputs and support services.
Feedback from farmers and extension workers during field visits have revealed a high expectation level
for the use of pesticides and fertilizers. The intensification of rice production following the rehabilitation
of irrigation schemes will add greater pressure on farmers for such inputs. In addition, farmers complain
that pests have developed resistance to current traditional methods and therefore require stronger and
more potent agents. The PMU should take this feedback seriously in the design and implementation of the
PASC. In particular, PASC's involvement in providing inputs to farmers should be guided by two
important issues:
*  the importance of appropriate fertilizer and pesticide use, and,
*  the limited human resource and budgetary capacity at the districts to provide such extension
needs.
As a mitigation measure, ARP II would finance the procurement of fertilizers and pesticides by the
PASCs on the condition that they and the extension agents stationed at their headquarters provide training
and awareness about safe and sustainable fertilizer and pesticide usage. All procurement of pesticides by
the PASCs should be in accordance with the World Bank Operational Policy OP 4.09, which forbids the
procurement of dangerous pesticides classified as Class 1 by the World Health Organization (Table 12.4).
In addition, DAA staff would receive training on integrated pest management (IPM) as part of the
technical training provided by the Project, and is expected to promote IPM measures to farmers in the
course of their extension work.
The PMU should, however, ensure that the storage and the sale of pesticides and agrochemicals by the
PASC are strictly prohibited in this area. The proposed PASC in Aileu will be located in an organic
coffee producing area. Besides providing small-scale output marketing and commercial transport, this
PASC will be linked to the NCBA/Cafe Timor farmer cooperative supported by USAID and suppliers of
other major stakeholders such as Timorcorp and Delta Cafe. Timorese organic coffee has an international
market and is one of the few export items from the agricultural sector. The private sector driven
certification process used in this industry provides a strong incentive to ensure that farmers do not violate
the organic basis of coffee production. The PMU should, however, monitor the sale of pesticides and
other agrochemicals by the PASC in this area.
Component 4: Program Management
The project will finance two sub-components under this component: (i) Policy and Strategy and, (ii)
Project Management and Capacity Building.
(a)    Policy and Strategy. The project will finance the study and production of policy notes on
strategic issues such as East Timor's agricultural policy and forest strategy.
(b)    Project Management and Capacity Building. This sub-component would carry out the overall
management of the project and capacity building. The project would provide equipment, vehicles,
training, services and operational costs in support of the following activities:

The Project Management Unit established in ARP I would continue in ARP II under the direct
responsibility of the Director of Agricultural Affairs (DAA). Core staff in the PMU would include a
project management advisor, procurement, finance, monitoring and evaluation and training specialists, the
Heads of all DAA Sections (Food Crops, Forestry, Fisheries, Irrigation, and Livestock), and international
advisors on project management, financial management, procurement and monitoring and evaluation.
The PMU will be responsible for green environmental issues, sustainable agriculture, and forestry. Staff
will be advocates for the environment and for sustainable farming practices. The Project would finance
this training. The goal is to help farmers develop integrated cropping and livestock systems including
agroforestry based systems that permit improved nutrient cycling and biological control of pests and
diseases. The Project is designed to help farmers achieve sustainable intensification, which ensures
simultaneous increase in returns to land and labor and the maintenance of soil nutrient balance.
Investment in farm inputs will be provided only to sustain the economic and environmental framework of
the prevailing traditional production system which relies on locally available resources instead of
purchased externally produced inputs.
The PMU would be responsible for all the mechanics of the Project: preparing, advertising, evaluating
tenders and awarding contracts for the procurement of civil works; obtaining clearances, including
customs; managing the Project's special account; making payments and keeping accounts; implementing,
supervising, monitoring and evaluating the implementation of Project activities; and submitting to IDA
Project progress and implementation completion reports. In preparing and evaluating tenders, PMU staff
will be formulating contracts and selecting contractors based, in part, on environmentally compatible
construction methods and least-disturbance techniques. These contracts should also include the provisions
for mitigation measures identified earlier. Part of the monitoring and evaluation of the project will include
an environmental monitoring program.
The potential environmental impacts of each of the project components and the remedies included in the
Project are indicated in the matrix below.
