APPRAISAL OF A SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Volume II, Part 1.)
PHILIPPINE SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRIES
A. THE ROLE OF SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRIES IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
1.01      The Manufacturing Sector:  Of the 10,248 establishments covered
in the 1971 Annual Survey of Manufactures (Table 1), 8,203 (80%) were
cottage industries made up largely of handicraft and traditional non-
factory units. They employed 16% of the labor force and, with a notably
low level of labor productivity, contributed slightly less than 5% to
gross value added in manufacturing. The ASM data on this group however
are not complete, and do not include the smallest, "unorganized" firms
with 1 - 4 workers. Unofficial estimates 1/ indicate a far greater role
of cottage units in manufacturing employment (75%) and value added (10%).
However as the data are very weak for comparative purposes and cottage
industries as a group (establishments with less than e 100,000 in fixed
assets and with between 1 to 19 workers) are treated differently for
government policy and program purposes, they are not covered extensively
in the following analysis. The remaining 2,045 establishments, those
with 20 or more workers, covered in the 1971 ASM make up what, in con-
trast to cottage industries, is the "modern" manufacturing sector.

1.02      The Role of Small and Medium Industries: 1/  As Table 2 shows,
approximately two-thirds (19363) of modern manufacturing firms are small
scale. They employ 16% of labor, but with a comparatively lower level of
labor productivity, contribute only 10% to gross value added. Medium
scale establishments formed the smallest group, with 291 (14%) firms em-
ploying 11% of labor and contributing 11% to gross value added. Only 19%
of the number of firms were large scale, but they dominated in terms of
employment (73%) and value added (79%). Small and medium industries to-
gether accounted for 81% of modern manufacturing firms. They employed
27% of the labor force and contributed 21% to gross value added.

1/ For official administrative purposes in the Philippines manufacturing
establishments are divided into four groups, according to size of
fixed assets. From an analysis of census data the ntmber of workers
employed per establishment, another commonly used index of scale,
turns out to be a fairly good indicator of the "official" category
the average firm would fall into. The target group for the proposed
loan includes small industries, with between e- 100,000 - 1,000,000
in fixed assets and on average employing 20 to 99 workers, and medium
industries, with between e- 1 - 4 million in fixed assets and 100 - 199
workers.

1.03      Inter-Country Comparisons:  Compared with other developing
countries, small and medium industries in the Philippines play a less
significant role in manufacturing. (Table 3) Whereas Philippine small
industries employ approximately 13% of the total manufacturing labor force
(including the "organized" cottage industries) and contribute 9% of value
added, in Korea and Colombia, two countries at comparable levels of indus-
trialization, they account for between 18% and 29% of labor employed in
manufacturing and between 12% and 19% of value added. In less industrial-
ized Malaysia, small industries contribute as much as 36% of employment
and 28% of value added, and in Singapore, at a much higher level of in-
dustrialization, small industries are also more prominent, with 27% of
manufacturing employment and 20% of value added. The contrast is less
striking for medium industries which account for approximately 10% of em-
ployment and value added in the Philippines (and Korea), but in the other
countries contribute between 13% and 16% of employment and 17% and 23% of
value added.
1.04      The relatively underdeveloped role of small industries in the
Philippines as compared to other countries emerges independent of general
characteristics of industrialization. (Table 4) Industrial policies and
incentives, on balance, favor large scale manufacturing in all of the
other countries. It would appear however that over time the extent of
the bias in favor of large scale manufacturing (with 200 and more workers)
has been greater in the Philippines. The international comparison sug-
gests that there are good possibilities for future growth in manufacturing
on a small and medium scale in the Philippines. This conclusion is con-
firmed by an analysis of manufacturing performance in the Philippines.
There is no optimal scale of efficiency in manufacturing. It varies from
small, to medium, to large depending on product. (See Basic Data Tables)
The evidence available indicates several opportunities for entry of new
small and medium firms and for their expansion in the manufacture of a
wide variety of products, such as garments and wood furniture for both
domestic and export markets and in agro-related industries, including food
processing and small agricultural machinery. With appropriate policies
(aimed more at neutralizing the bias against SMI rather than toward their
active promotion) and access to the necessary financial and technical as-
sistance, Philippine SMI could play a more significant role in future in-
dustrialization.
1.05-    Regional Distribution of SMI:  An analysis of Gross Domestic
Product by regional origin shows an overwhelming concentration of economic
activity, except for agriculture and mining, in the Southern Tagalog
Region (IV) which includes Metropolitan Manila (47.4% of total GDP).
There is no other comparable concentration of activity. At a much lower
level, between 6% and 9% of GDP originates in each of five other regions:
Central Luzon (III); Western Visayas (VI); Central Visayas (VII); Northern
Mindanao (X); and Southern Mindanao (XI). (Table 5) Small and medium
industries, which tend to cluster in urban areas close to supply and de-
mand and where infrastructure facilities and other services are more de-
veloped, follow this pattern, but to an even higher degree of regional
concentration. About 65% of SMI establishments are located in the

Southern Tagalog Region:  53% are in Metropolitan Manila alone.  Of the
remaining 35% of SMI, about 23% are found in the five regions of greatest
overall economic activity and larger urban marketplaces: Central Luzon
(8.8%); Central Visayas (7.3%); Western Visayas (4.0%); Southern Mindanao
(4.0%); and Northern Mindanao (3.0%). (Table 6) Large scale industries,
while still concentrated in the same regions, are relatively more
decentralized.
1.06      Regional Distribution of Cottage Industries:  Cottage industries
are by far the most dispersed. They are less dependent on power and tend
to process locally available materials for highly localized and small mar-
kets. Approximately three quarters of the smallest establishments are in
the food industries (milling, bakeries, etc.) and wearing apparel (tailor-
ing, dressmaking, etc.). There are fairly large numbers (from 3 - 5% of
the total) in the textiles, metal products, electrical machinery and
transport equipment industries where they provide services as well as
fabricating small parts and components. These industries could provide
an important source of entrepreneurs and of semi-skilled and skilled
labor in the development of SMI in the regions. Financing institutions
and DOI's technical assistance field teams 1/ are making an effort to as-
sist the larger cottage manufacturers with good prospects for expansion
especially in less developed rural areas. The National Electrification
Administration's (NEA) program to establish industries in rural areas
will also reach the cottage industry group. 2/ With one of NEA's criteria
in project selection being the availability of local skills and a tradi-
tional base on which to build, it is expected that cottage industry work-
ers (who are generally engaged in part-time manufacturing jobs with low
productivity and wages) will be employed full-time in these new projects.3/
1/  See Part 2 on the Medium and Small Industry Coordinated Action Pro-
gram (MASICAP). The DBP branches and agencies and other financing
institutions have a backlog of applications from cottage industries.
Improvement in procedures and staff capability should ease the bottle-
necks in handling large numbers of small loan applications. As there
is no restriction on minimum size loans for this project, it is ex-
pected that the spin-offs from increased capability and funding will
favorably effect cottage industries firms as well.
2/  Volume I, Annex 7 NEA.
3/  In the few cases where assistance to cottage industries has been suc-
cessful, e.g., in the Madras leather industry in India, the approach
of providing management, marketing and technical assistance now being
taken by NEA has been used. In the private sector in the Philippines,
this approach has proven effective in one noteworthy instance, i.e.,
organizing production of abaca handicraft products for export.

1.07      Future Trends for Regional Distribution:  Increased regional
dispersal of manufacturing industries (particularly small scale) is ex-
pected to take place in future years. The preliminary release of data
from the 1972 Economic Census indicates a continuation of past loca-
tional patterns (Table 7) among the six most developed regions, although
there was a shift away from the Southern Tagalog region. Since 1973,
however, the Government has taken steps to restrict creation of capacity
in more heavily industrialized urban areas (Greater Manila, Cebu City,
and parts of Davao City) and has begun to emphasize regional planning.
In 1974 the DOI's Conmission on Small and Medium Industries was created
primarily to implement a program to assist the growth and development of
small and medium industries in the regions, as part of the policy of pro-
viding guidance and resources for regional development. There are al-
ready encouraging signs of follow-through of Government policies, with
more recent data on loan commitments by financial institutions suggesting
a movement of SMI outward from the Manila area.
1.08      Markets Served by SMI:  SMI for the most part sell directly to
the highly concentrated urban markets where the factories are located.
A significant share of their output however reaches fairly distant na-
tional markets, mostly through middlemen who purchase at the factory gate
for transport and resale.  Interviews with entrepreneurs and staff of SMI
assistance programs suggest that SMI are beginning to develop more of a
regional marketing perspective and are aggressively pursuing entry into
wider markets.
1.09      At least a small share of SMI products are being exported.  A
comparison of SMI share in total output to exports by product indicates
that in the past SMI made a significant contribution in furniture, leather,
and miscellaneous manufactured exports. (Table 8) SMI may also play an
important role in other manufactured exports, such as specialized food
preparations, wood, and chemicals, although much more detailed data are
needed to follow up on these crude indicators. While a share of SMI
output reaches export markets, through direct sales and middlemen, it is
likely to remain insignificant without substantially greater assistance
to the small manufacturer. Smaller firms often have difficulty in ex-
porting because of low quality products, lack of standardization, ina-
bility to meet minimum quantity orders, and difficulties in covering mar-
keting overheads. They also have difficulty finding suitable export
financing. Under the government program of assistance to SMI particular
attention is being paid to find ways to develop their export potential.
B. CHANGING PATTERNS IN SMI GROWTH, 1962 TO 1971
1.10       Overall Changes:  In the mid-1960's growth in modern manufactur-
ing, on the whole, was very sluggish. Towards the end of the decade
growth rates increased, although not at a pace in keeping with expected
potential of the sector. From 1962 to 1968 employment in modern manufac-
turing grew at an average annual rate of 0.2%. Gross output grew at 3.1%

in real terms (measured in 1965 constant prices) and value added at 2.0%.
(Table 9) From 1968 to 1971 manufacturing activity increased, with em-
ployment growing at an average annual rate of 2.8%, output at 6.8% and
value added at 7.8%. During this period (1962 through 1971) the role of
SMI as compared to large scale industries rose and then fell off again in
both relative and absolute terms. It could be expected in a normal pat-
tern that the relative share of SMI in manufacturing would decline as
growth in large scale industries accelerated. However, in the aggregate
Philippine SMI have also experienced a substantial decrease in their ab-
solute rates of growth.

1.11      Between 1962 and 1968 the growth of small and medium industries
far exceeded growth in large scale manufacturing. Employment in SMI grew
at an average annual rate of 2 - 3%, while employment in large scale manu-
facturing actually declined at an average annual rate of 0.7%. Gross
value added in small industries grew at a rate of 4.2% and in medium in-
dustries at 10%. In large industries gross value added grew much more
slowly, at 0.7%. From 1968 to 1971 the growth pattern shifted. Small in-
dustries actually declined in employment (-6.5% average annual rate) and
value added (-2.7%), and medium industries grew at much slower rates in
both employment (1.6%) and value added (1.1%). In comparison, large in-
dustries achieved accelerated growth rates in employment (5.6%) and value
added (10.8%). In the mid-1960's period of comparatively high growth
rates, SMI played an increasingly important role in manufacturing as com-
pared to large industry. SMI share of employment rose from 29% to 33%,
of output from 25% to 30%, and of value added from 19% to 25%. However,
in the subsequent period, 1968-1971, the share of SMI diminished in manu-
facturing employment to 27%, in gross output to 25% and in value added
to 21%.
1.12      Diversity of SMI by Major Product Groups:  In 1971 over 50% of
total modern manufacturing production was concentrated in consumer goods,
40% in intermediate goods, and only 7 - 8% in capital goods. The impact



- 13 -
of small and medium scale industries was however greatest in intermediate
goods, where they accounted for approximately 35% of total employment and
32% of value added, and capital goods, with almost 40% of employment and
26% of value added. SMI accounted for only 20% of employment and 12% of
value added in consumer goods, which is dominated by large scale mass pro-
duced manufactured food, beverage, and tobacco products. (As much as 35%
of total large scale manufacturing employment and almost 50% of value
added are in food, beverages, and tobacco.)
Total Modern Manufacturing          Share in SMI

Consumer Goods            53.4         52.4              20.3         11.5

See Table 10, page 14.
1.13      Approximately 40% of SMI is in four subsectors:
Establishments   Employment   Value Added
Food                                13              11            11

42              39            42
See Table 11, page 15.
The remaining 60% is spread fairly evenly among all major product groups,
at the two digit level. In terms of the share of SMI as compared to large
scale manufacturing, however, SMI have their greatest impact in other sub-
sectors. (Table 11) Over half of total manufacturing employment and value

goods is in SMI. Between one-third and one-half of employment in footwear,
and other apparel, metal, naper, petroleum and coal, and rubber (and
chemical) products, basic metals, transport equipment, and electrical
machinery is in SMI. Their share in value added in these sub-sectors
ranges from 19% to 46%. SMI have least impact in the mass produced con-
sumer goods--food, beverages, tobacco and textiles--and in wood and non-
metallic minerals.
1.14      Role of SMI by Makor Tndustry Groups:  In the mid-1960's period
of growth, the share of SMI in employment and production increased notably
in capital goods industries (t-ansport equipment, and electrical machinery,
appliances and apparatus anc machlinery), and to some extent in intermediate
goods (rubber products, chemicals and chemical products) and consumer goods
(food and textiles). (Table 12) In 1971 the percentage of employmen't and
output remained about the sane or dropped, except in leather, and rubber
products, chemicals, and textiles where SMI continued to grow. The fluctu-
ations in impact of SKI compared to that of large scale industries in major
product groups could be explainey, in part, by the relative scope for im-
port substitution and the levels of protection. During the 1960's the
ratio of imports tc domestic availability was relatively high in the pro-
duct groups favored by SMI. (Table 13) At the same time, the effective
rate of protection realized for transport equipment (77), machinery
(112), and intermediate products (88) (including chemical products, rubber
products, and fabrics) was higher than the realized effective rate for all
manufacturing (49) 2/, thus making these industry groups more attractive
for the entry of SMI. 3/
1.15      There is no ready explanation as to why in the 1968-71 period
small industries actually decreased and medium industries experienced
substantially lower rates of growth. At a more disaggregated level it
could be expected that SMI would not be in direct competition with large
scale production, but would be diversifying into product lines where there
are no substantial economies of scale.  However, policy incentives have
encouraged large firms inr the Philippines towards vertical integration,
and have otherwise encouraged inefficient large size firms, thus narrowing
the opportunities for SMI to produce similar products (and offer similar
1/ Total SMI share is estimated, since data for medium and large indus-
tries are not broken down. However small industries alone (20 - 99
workers) account for 48% of employment and 34% of value added in the
machinery sub-sector.

services) even where economies of scale in production do not exist. For
example, in the ILO report (Ranis Mission) it was found that garment man-
ufacture which could be carried out efficiently on a small scale was in-
creasingly concentrated in large scale firms. For other products SMI ex-
perience competition from imports which are allowed because they are felt
not to be produced domestically in sufficient quantity or are felt not to
be of comparable quality. The extent of the distortionary effects on SMI
ability to compete would appear to be substantial. As the size of both
the domestic and export markets did not expand appreciably during the
1960's, SMI were further constrained in prospects for capturing new mar-
kets or diversifying. In addition, the slow growth of medium industries
and the decline of small industries is also attributable to inefficien-
cies caused by capital, management, and technology constraints, and the
lack of assistance available to overcome them.

C. FACTOR PROPORTIONS AND PRODUCTIVITY IN SMI
Labor Intensity in SMI:  Small and medium industries are more
labor intensive than large industries. (Table 14) The amount of labor
employed per unit of capital is highest in small (.088) and medium firms
(.072), and falls to .045 in large firms. Labor content (per unit of



-19 -
gross value added) is similarly highest for small firms (.082) and de-
clines for medium scale (.051) and large scale (.045). Conversely, capi-
tal intensity increases as scale increases: from e- 11,400 per worker in
small firms to e 14,000 per worker in medium firms, to a high of - 22,300
per worker in large scale production. At the aggregate level this fits
the pattern found normally in other countries.

1.17      As has been found in other countries labor productivity is lower
in Philippine SMI, especially in small industries where the amount of
capital employed per unit of labor is lowest. Low labor productivity in
small firms accounts for the gap between percentage of manufacturing em-
ployment in SMI as compared to contribution to gross value added. Never-
theless, in terms of returns to labor, while productivity and average
wage rates are lower in small industries, wages as a percent of gross
value added are higher. (Table 15)

1.18      The inability of small and medium industries to sustain improved
productivity, and thus competitiveness, explains in part the eventual de-
cline of relative impact of SMI in total manufacturing. Comparative
growth rates and labor productivity in five selected product groups in
which SMI have played an increasingly important role are shown in Table 16.
Growth rates and productivity increases have been sustained by SMI only
in one product group--chemicals. While growth and productivity increases
have been uneven in textiles and transport equipment, medium industries
have recovered lost ground in more recent years in these product groups.
Furthermore, the decline in the proportion of capital formation (fixed
assets and annual net investment) in SMI as compared to that in large
scale industries is indicative of both the inability of SMI to finance
growth and improvements and perhaps also to a lack of demand fot their
products thus making further investment in SMI unattractive. (See Basic
Data Tables)
1.19      Capital Productivity in SMI:  Small and medium use the scarce
factor, capital, more efficiently than large scale firms. Medium size
firms use capital most productively (O/K, 1.4), followed by small firms
(O/K, 1.1), and finally large firms (O/K, 1.0). While small industries
appear only marginally more efficient than large scale in the use of
capital, on closer examination (Basic Data Table K) the larger firms in
the "small" group (i.e., those with between 50 - 99 workers) are more ef-
ficient in the use of capital (outpuc/capital ratio 1.3) than the smaller
firms (20 - 49 workers) in this group. These small firms along with large
firms (200 - 499 workers) use capital least productively.  In other coun-
tries (e.g., Pakistan, India, Japan) firms in the 20 - 49 workers (and
10 - 19 workers) size group also are observed to be uneconomic in certain
industries. However since, in the Philippines, this is observable in the
aggregate, it would suggest the prevalence of a large number of uneconomic
firms in the 20 - 49 workers group, because of either inappropriate scale
or because of serious inefficiencies due to other causes.
D. CONSTRAINTS ON INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY IN SMI
1.20      The relatively low and uneven labor productivity in SMI and the
inefficient use of capital by the smallest firms may be explained by a
number of factors including: i) the lower quantity (and quality) of capi-
tal goods employed; ii) the lack of access to external sources of both
investment and working capital; iii) the lower level of skills recruited
and the tendency to use the apprenticeship system to train labor; and
iv) more generally, the inefficiency in smaller firms caused by a lack of
expertise in organization, management, and choice and ralionalization of
technology.
1.21      Capital Constraints:  Available information reinforced bY the
appraisal mission's firsthand observations during visits to a number of
smaller establishments indicate that there is great scope for improving
SMI efficiency. Long term capital is needed to replace outmoded and in-
appropriate machinery for improved processes and for expansion in the

same and related lines of production where demand is increasing. The
considerable underutilization of capacity and problems of marketing flex-
ibility could also be relieved by providing SMI with sufficient access
to permanent working capital to build up inventories of materials and
finished goods beyond one production period. 1/ However as institutional
sources of financing generally have not been accessible, SMI have been
forced to rely heavily on internal resources, or short term borrowing
from non-institutional sources at rates of 5 - 10% per month depending on
the amount, thus severely restraining the ability to modernize, expand,
and establish new units.
1.22      Skill Constraints:  Efficiency problems are compounded by the
relatively low level of managerial skills--in financial management as well
as work organization, production, planning, and marketing--and of techni-
cal expertise in refining choice of technologies for improved processes.
In many cases entrepreneurs are knowledgeable in one particular area, for
example, those with engineering backgrounds can handle their technology
problems, but are weak in management. In other cases, former merchants
that have gone into manufacturing may be strong in marketing and manage-
ment areas, but require technical advice on improvement in production pro-
cesses. Generally, a package of services is necessary to ensure that
small firms have timely access to whatever kind of assistance is necessary.
E. CONSTRAINTS ON THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF SMI
1.23      The Industrial Policy Framework:  Although the manufacturing
sector is fairly well developed in the Philippines, the industrial struc-
ture is top heavy. Production is concentrated in large scale, capital
intensive firms that have benefited from inducements allowing the import
of capital goods, components, and industrial raw materials at concession-
ary rates. High levels of protection of finished goods coupled with the
tariff and tax relief have resulted in high toleration of inefficiencies
(such as the creation of excess capacity), accelerated capital labor sub-
stitution, and vertical integration of production that could be carried
on in smaller units. Theoretically small and medium manufacturers should
also benefit from favorable conditions afforded by high protective levels,
1/  Considerable underutilization of installed capacity ih SMI, particu-
larly in the regions, results from unreliable supplies of power.
Outages of 4 - 6 hours during a working day are common resulting in
wasted production and idle equipment and labor. Small entrepreneurs
are often forced to overinvest in capacity on the assumption that they
only have 4 - 6 hours of production time per day. Most small entre-
preneurs, unlike their larger counterparts, cannot afford their own
standby generators and hence are totally vulnerable to vagaries in
power supply. This factor also explains, partly, why SMI are gener-
ally unable to reliably supply large batch orders within the time
limits usually set by exporters or large firms.



- 23 -
but even within this framework SMI cannot compete since they generally
are discriminated against by lack of access to the same cost-reducing
(distorting) incentives and to industrial financing for investment and
short-term capital needs available to alrge firms. In spite of adverse
conditions, as noted above, SMI have succeeded in entering certain mar-
kets; their position however has been very unstable due to apparently
fluctuating market conditions they face and the inability to sustain
competitiveness, whether directly with domestic production of homogenous
products in large scale corporations or with imports.
1.24      Market Accessibility:  High urban concentration in Greater
Manila and surrounding areas coupled with only moderate increases in ag-
gregate consumer demand in this area have further constrained the overall
growth of SMI. Poor (or expensive) access to larger national markets
restricts the competitiveness of SMI already located in the Manila area
since they cannot achieve the external economies of large-scale opera-
tions.  On the other hand, larger firms with greater flexibility (e.g.,
in the wood and cement industries) have been able to locate in less de-
veloped areas close to raw material sources. These firms however have
generally geared their operations so as to be virtually self-contained and
have not provided the linkages that could be expected for SMI. Current
efforts to discourage such practices would result in a broader based in-
dustrial structure in the future.  As for markets outside Manila, the
smaller urban centers such as Cebu and Davao provide good prospects. In.
other areas, however, demand tends to be restrained by low rural incomes.
With the present push for improvements in agriculture and regional develop-
ment generally coupled with the rapid increase in rural incomes over the
last 2 - 3 years, demand for manufactured goods and services in the non-
urban areas can be expected to increase, thus providing greater oppor-
tunities for SMI to disperse regionally.
1.25      Infrastructure and Support Services:  Even where there is de-
mand, or good prospects exist for developing markets in the short run,
smaller firms find it costly to locate in the regions. There are con-
straints on the supply side, even for primarily resource-based industries.
Communications and power facilities are inadequate; supporting services
such as those provided by financial institutions, suppliers, consultants,
transporters, wholesalers, and other industries for intermediate and
finishing processes and maintenance are difficult to find in the local
area, and expensive if available only by shuttling to Manila. For SMI
manufacturers located in the regions the main difficult4es seemed *to be:
1) power shortages; 2) centralization of decision-making on the part of
financial institutions in the Manila head offices; 3) prolonged periods
of delay in communicating with suppliers and receiving orders; 4) lack of
local sources for advice on technical problems; and 5) lack of lQcal as-
sistance in formulating project proposals for financing.
1.26      Constraints on Exporting:  As regards export markets, small and
medium industries in addition to a lack of export market knowledge, also
have difficulties on the production side (design, quality, and quantity),



- 24 -
in marketing and in access to trade finance which would enable them to
meet export orders reliably. Exports in manufactured goods that could
be produced on a relatively small scale (for example, furniture, garments,
specialized textiles, and prepared foods) have been increasing in the
1970's and there is scope for increases in such products as small agri-
cultural implements. With assistance in improving product quality and
efficiency, and in financing and marketing arrangements SMI could suc-
cessfully enter export markets to a much greater extent in virtually all
industry groups.
1.27      Difficulties in Meeting Institutional Requirements:  There is a
large number of Filipino entrepreneurs who are ready to expand and invest
in new ventures. With new government policy ensuring accessibility to
financing, they face a more general and immediate problem of firming up
project feasibilities (and making necessary technical decisions) and pre-
paring acceptable applications for financing institutions. The process
involves a number of steps including clearing land titles, ensuring com-
pliance with government registrations and certificates (in certain indus-
tries such as food) obtaining quoatations from suppliers, and so on.
Smaller firms which generally have almost no managerial staff (often only
the entrepreneur who may be assisted by family members in bookkeeping,
sales, etc., attends to such problems) do not have the time (or contacts
to cut red tape), and usually lack knowledge of the best sources to con-
tact for assistance to carry out a feasibility study and put it into a
form acceptable to financial institutions. Consequently plans for new
investment tend to take unduly long to come to fruition. In the meantime
improvisations (often very inefficient for labor as well as capital use)
are made and opportunities are foregone. In addition, with current rates
of inflation, project costs have to continually be revised upwards. These
constraints are being relieved, but only to a very limited extent, by the
DOI's field assistance teams and also by financial institutions who are
simplifying their informational requirements.
F. THE PROGRAM OF ASSISTANCE TO SMI
1.28      These constraints on the development of SMI have been recognized
by Government, and in keeping with the new policy thrust of encouraging
and assisting growth of SMI primarily in less developed regions, both
financial and technical assistance programs are being developed and imple-
mented. It is in these two principal areas where small and medium indus-
tries have had least access to outside assistance, in both the public and
private sectors.
1.29      In 1974 the Department of Industry was created with one of its
major tasks being the implementation and coordination of programs of as-
sistance to SMI. The DOI's basic approach is to reach small and medium
firms at their places of business with direct assistance by field teams



- 25 -
who are permanently located throughout the regions. The field teams,
comprised of generalists, are responsible for assisting entrepreneurs
with project feasibility studies--and the many time consuming steps which
are often the greatest bottlenecks in moving a project along--and prepar-
ation of loan applications. When more involved technical assistance is
required, the teams work through the channel of communications set up
with the support staff in the central unit of the Department of Industry.
The central office, which is just being fully staffed, in turn, is
equipped to provide the more specialized assistance directly or contact
appropriate agencies with the requested expertise. Thus far the program,
which was started on a modest basis to determine the real needs of small
entrepreneurs in the regions, has been successful in providing entrepre-
neurs with practical services. On the basis of experience gained, the
Regional Technical Assistance Centers, being proposed for financing in
the start-up phases under this project, will be implemented to provide
greater depth and breadth in technical services permanently located in
the regions. The DOI program is discussed in detail in part 2 of this
volume. The RTAC's are discussed in more detail in Volume 1, Annex 8.

PHILIPPINES
Appraisal of a Small and Medium Industry Development Project
Volume II, Part 2.
Technical Assistance Programs for Small and Medium Industries
A. Background
2.01      Prior to 1974 small manufacturers in the Philippines had little
access to technical assistance needed to establish, improve,, and expand
their operations. To remedy this situation the Government, through its
Department of Industry, plans to provide a wide range of technical
assistance programs designed to promote the development of SMI. A number
of government ageacies and government-supported institutions have now
launched, or are planning, programs for assisting small entrepreneurs in
project development, management, choice of technology, and marketing.
Overall responsibility for co-ordinating these programs is a function of
the Department of Industry (DOI). Within mDI, a Commission on Small and
Medium Industries (CSMI) has been created to coordinate the individual
agencies' SMI programs and, in keeping with GOP priority on development
of rural areas, to establish a broad network of technical assistance
services to reach small and medium entrepreneurs in areas outside Greater
Manila. One such field program, the Medium and Small Industries Coordinated
Action Program (MASICAP), has been operational since November 1973, and
another (comprising the seven Regional Technical Assistance Centers) is
scheduled to go into operation in 1975.
B.  The Department of Industry (DI)
2.02      Establishment.  In June 1974, Presidential Decree No. 488 (PD 488)
provided for the creation of a Department of Industry to be "the primary
policy, planning, programming, coordinating, impleinenting and administrative
entity of the executive branch of government in the development, expansion
and diversification of industry..." 1/.  In amending the Integrated Reorganiza-
tion Plan to bring all industrialization programs under one department, the
Board of Investments (BOI) along with the Iron and Steel, Fertilizer and Cement
Industry Authorities and the Presidential Advisory Committee on the Copper
Industry were transferred to the Department of Industry. While they
continue to fVunction under their own separate legal authorities, their
activities will be co-ordinated by the IOI. In addition, the Bureau of
Industrial Promotion, formerly in the Department of Trade, and the National
Council for Small and Medium Industries were abolished and their functions
taken over by the new Department.
1/   See Appendix 5.  Text of Presidential Decree No. 488. Further Amendin
Past IX of the Integrated Reorganization Plan by Creating a Department
of Industry.



2.03      Organization and Staffin.  DOI is headed by the Secretary of In-
dustry Hir. V.T. Paterno, concurrently Chairman of the BO!.  A Presidentially
appointed Under-Secretary of Industry (Governor C.C. Diel) is responsible
for heading the Commission on Small and Medium Industries (CS.MI), the largest
of the three DOI sub-divisions. With 44 central office staff and 150 field
staff positions CSMI absorbs approximately 44% of the DOI budget.1/ The
other two sub-divisions of DOI are the Bureau of Industrial Coordination,
(BIC) with 35 staff and absorbing 22% of the DOI budget, and the Bureau of
Industrial Information and Programs (BIIP) with 25 staff and accounting for
19% of the budget . Each of these Bureaus is headed by an Assistant
Secretary.  These three operating units together with two units providing
deDartmental financial and administrative services make up the central
office DOI staff totalling 146. The DOI budget estimate (Appendix 1) for
FY75, including personnel services, capital outlay, and maintenance, is
F5.7 million.  Projections for the five year plar. period indicate an
increase to P8 million in FY78.2/  DOI's organization is outlined in Chart
No. 9513.
2.o4      Functions.  BIC and BIIP are concerned with policy and program
formulation and implementation on a sector basis for medium and large scale
industries, defined as manufacturing firms with total assets of over
F1 million and/or with 100 or more employees. The Comnission on Small and
Medium Industries, on the other hand, is responsible for coordinating all
SMI assistance programs and for providing direct technical assistance to
small as well as medium-scale manufacturers3/, particularly to firms located
outside the Greater Manila. There is already an appropriate overlap accommodat-
ing medium-scale firms in both the sectoral approach for policy and program
formulation as well as in the provision of technical (and access to financial)
assistance to individual firms, especially in more remote areas. However,
adequate attention has not yet been given to including small-scale manu-
facturers, on a sector basis, in the various stages of policy and program
formulation.  The Commission is scheduled to participate in BIC's program
for establishing a channel of communications with manufacturers (para. 2.06).-
This link could be strengthened, and, at the same time, small manufacturers'
participation in industry associations encouraged through the Field
Operations and Central Support Units of the CSMI.
1/   The 44 regular staff positions do not include the Commission's MASICAP
field teams (150 members); however the budget includes allocations for
the field program.
2/   This does not include the budget or staff of the BOI and attached
authorities.
3/   Small-scale is defined as manufacturing establishments the total assets
of which are P100,000 to P1 million and/or 20-99 employees. 'Medium-scale
are those firms with between P1 million and L million in total assets and
employment in the range of 100-199.

2.05      The Bureau of Industrial Information and Programs.  BIIP is
responsible for providing the Department with timely information on
industry performance, identifying and anticipating problem areas through
analysis of basic data and special sector studies, and formulating industry
sector programs. PD 488 empowers DOI to request from all establishments
information necessary for its purposes. In this connection, the Information
and Statistics Section of BIIP is implementing a registration procedure that
entails all medium and large scale manufacturing firms submitting, on a
monthly basis, data on their performance. In addition to providing a data
base for the Department's internal needs, the information will be published
on a quarterly basis (or more frequently if the DOI finds it has the
capability to do so).
2.06      The Bureau of Industrial Coordination.  BIC has the major function
of coordinating and supervising industry performance in accordance with sector
programs developed by the Department to meet national objectives. Five
industry desks have been established to maintain contact with the private
sector under a joint project    with the Philippine Chamber of Industries
launched in October 1974. The objective of the project is "the establishment
of a two way channel between the government and the private industry sector
for consultations on government policies, rules and regulations affecting
industry and for transmission to government of information on industry
problems and proposals ... 'MCommunication channels between the DOI and PCI
and between manufacturing firms and the two agencies are depicted in Chart
No. 9314. Industry desks in DOI, and corresponding desks in PCI, have been
assigned to cover industry groups by final product and by preponderant
characteristics of individual firms or industry associations, as showrn in
Appendix 2.  Allowance has been made for increasing the number of industry
desks to a maximum of ten.   The possibility of PCI creating a separate
desk for small industries as a counterpart to CSMI is under consideration.
At present CSMI has direct contact with small entrepreneurs through its
field operations, and plans to work directly with the PCI liaison committee
on behalf of small industry. However, small manufacturers (as with their
large-scale counterparts) are affected by and concerned with policy as it
affects individual industries in addition to policies which affect them as
a "sector". They would probably be better served, therefore, by inclusion
in the DOI/PCI industry desks. PCI and CSMI could work together to promote
and assist small entrepreneurs either in forming trade associations or
encouraging them to join existing ones.
C. The Commission on Small and Medium Industries (CSMI)
2.07      Functions.  The Commission on Small and Medium Industries is
responsible for promoting and assisting the growth of small and medium
industries, particularly in rural areas. While actual establishment of
and investment in SMI would be carried out entirely by the private sector,
CSMI, on its part, would facilitate this activity by encouraging institutions

to provide financial and technical assistance support to the fullest possible
extent.
2.08      O  -anization. The Commisslon is organized to function at three
levels (Cha   931:central,regional,and local.  There are 41 staff
positions in the Central Office, three Regional Coordinators, and 150
field staff. In the approved budget for CSMI, approximately 83% of th e
personal services portion is devoted to Field Operations underscoring the
importance of this program. The four units making up the Central Support
Unit account for about 13% of the personal services budget. The inter-
agency Commission, including the Commissioner and member-agency represen-
tatives, are not salaried, but receive a per diem for meetings attended,
amounting to approximately 4% of CSMITs FY75 budget (Appendix 3).'
2,09      Representation on CSNI.  Eleven government agencies with policies
and programs of assistance to SKI are represented on CSMI which is intended
to serve as a forum for program coordination and.integration. These
agencies are:
DLGCD       Department of Local Government and Community
Development
UP/ISSI     University of the Philippines Institute of Small
Scale Industries*
DAP         Development Academy of the Philippines*
N12C        National Manpower and Youth Council
IGLF        National Economic Development Authority/Central Bank
(NEDA/CB) Industrial Guarantee Loan Fund**
DBP         Development Bank of the Philippines**
FTI         Food Terminal Inc.
PITC        Philippine International Trading Corporation
DC          Design Center of the Philippines
BODT        Bureau of Domestic Trade

NACIDA      National Cottage Industries Development Authority-/
*    Agencies to be instrumental in the start-up of the Dejartment of Industry
Regional Techunical Assistance Centers componpnt of the proposed loan.
**   Borrowing agencies under the proposed Bank loan.
1/   NACIDA remains within the Department of Trade and Tourism; however,
reportedly consideration is being given to transferring it to the
Department of Industry.



2.10      The Central Support Unit.  CSU, which constitutes the technical
core of CSMI, has four divisions: Technological Assistance, Financial
Assistance, Marketing Assistance, and Information and Programs. The
technical staff in the three functional divisions would operate as a
clearing house to gather, and put into usable format, information on the
types of technical assistance available to SMI. CSU would be expected to
support Field Operations programs by providing additional expertise to work
on specialized technical problems, and by establishing contact with appro-
priate outside sources for specific technical data or technical services. More-
over, each of the three functional divisions would evaluate the findings of
the field operations so that new programs could be formulated to meet the
practical needs of the entrepreneurs. CSU would also generally coordinate
CSMI activities with other agencies at the working level.
2.11      The Information and Programs Division.  IPD has the overall
responsibility of analyzing, and preparing for general availability, the
basic data available on SMI from the Bureau of the Census and Statistics
and other sources.l/ The Division will also identify areas where further
research is needed, and either undertake the studies or contract out the
work, for example, to the UP/ISSI or the DAP. Support will be given to other
projects both within DOI and in other institutions, for example, the
Regional Technical Assistance Centers and the Development Bank of the
Philippines, in the critical area of setting up evaluation systems to
measure the economic impact of small and medium industries.
2.12      Field Operations.  CSMI's field operations are carried out through
the Medium and Small Industries Coordinated Action Program (MASICAP) teams.
Fifty such teams (three members per team) have been located in provinces
outside the Greater Manila area to assist individual entrepreneurs in develop-
ing their projects and putting them into bankable applications (paras
2.15-2.18 for details). .The  seven Regional Technical Assistance Centers
'(RTACS), proposed for financing in the start-up phase under this project,
will become part of the Field Operations complex. RTAC staff, in addition to
providing direct technical assistance to individual entrepreneurs will provide
a hierarchical link between the MASICAP teams (who through their contact with
local entrepreneurs would provide an input into the RTAC program) and the
Central Support Unit staff (who are equipped to provide backup assistance in
contacting specialized expertise as the need for it is identified in the
field).
1/   For example, basic census data on SMI are alreaqy included in the BCS
Annual Survey of Manufactures, but the information is not analyzed or
published. The Division will not unnecessarily duplicate the field work,
but will concentrate on analyzing and publishing collected data as an
input into SWI program evaluation and planning.



-6-
2.13      Proposed Reorganization of CSMI.  The inter-agency Commission on
Small and Medium Industries was set up to function as a high level inter-
agency advisory and coordinating body concentrating on policy issues. In
the interim phase, as the DOI is gradually being staffed, the inter-agency
group of representatives has evolved, perhaps inevitably, into a working
group which determines the feasibility of detailed SMI assistance
programs with the preliminary information available. The inter-agency
Commission, however, was not created with such a task in mind, and is
ill-equipped to act as a program planning and development group. This is
the intended responsibility of the Central Support Unit, along with the
staff of divisions responsible for SMI policy and programs of the various
agencies. As originally planned, the Central Support Unit once fully staffed
should assume complete responsibility for gathering information, preparing
feasibility studies, and presenting developed program ideas as well as
evaluating on-going programs for the inter-agency Commission to review in
its advisory and coordination capacity. Furthermore with the imminent
expansion of Field Operations and,consequently, the increasingly important
role the Central Support divisions will play in coordination, formulation,
and e-aluation of programs (both within the DOI and in other agencies),, the ap-
praisal mission has recommended that CSMI be reorganized to re-orient its focus
to policy issues and to handle ivs broad range of responsibilities more
effectively. The proposed organization for CSMI is presented in Chart No.
9358. Under this scheme, each of the major programs would be given stronger
direction, and control of operations and responsibility woild be more clearly
defined. A Bureau of Field Assistance for SMI would bring together, under
one Director, responsibility for the Regional Technical Assistance Centers
program (eventually to be expanded to 11 centers in all) and the MASICAP
Unit. The Central Support Unit for SMI would be strengthened to carry out
its function as a centralized source of assistance to the field, on the one
hand, and as a planning and evaluation unit on the other hand.
D. The Medium and Small Industry Co-ordinated Action Program (MASICAP)
2.15      Objectives and Organization.  MASICAP has been operational since
November 1973, when the progran was originated by the Development Acadexy of
the Philippines. In June 1974, MASICAP was transferred to the newly created
DOI and placed under the Commission on Small and Medium Industries.  The pro-
gram is aimed at: assisting new and established small entrepreneurs at
their places of business; gathering information on their projects; going
through the procedures of obtaining necessary permissions from local govern-
ments; and organizing this information into a form acceptable for application
to financing institutions.  Where necessary, the team members also assist
individual entrepreneurs in finding external sources of technical expertise
through the CSMI in Maunila. The need for MASICAP services in individual
instances is usually identified by local government officials, DBP branches
agenc-es, and IGLF member banks.



-7-
2.16      Staffing.  MASICAP field units are made up of young recruits,
usually college graduates and graduating students with above average academic
standing and majoring in business administration, accounting, commerce, or
economics. These students or recent graduates are inducted for one year
periods. The success of the program and its wide appeal to activist students
eager to substitute practical work for purely academic study, has ensured an
excess supply of enthusiastic and well-trained recruits for the program.
Since poor financial management is one of the major weaknesses of small
businesses, each team has at least one member well-trained in accounting who
can assist the entrepreneur in installing a simple bookkeeping system. The
field teams are characterized in their composition by flexibility and versati-
lity. To avoid "bureaucratization" and to ensure maximum mobility on the
part of teams and individual team members, the teams do not have permanent
office facilities. They work as much as possible on the entrepreneur's
premises, use public transportation, and move their base of operations as
necessary to meet the demands of entrepreneurs who require their assistance.
The teams are directed by three Regional Coordinators, (for Luzon, the Visayas,
and Mindanao) who advise the teams on project selection, technical problems,
and solutions to problems that arise common to many enterprises. The Regional
Coordinators also channel specific requests for more specialized technical
assistance to the Manila office.
2.17      Project Preparation Fees and Costs.  MASICAP services are provided
on a no-fee basis. However, the entrepreneur generally is expected to provide
office and communication facilities and transportation to the project site
when public transport is poor or unavailable. The board and lodging of the
teams, general use of public transportation, cables and other communications
with the head office are financed through the MASICAP budget. On the average,
project preparation takes about one month of a team's time, and the cost to
MASICAP per project is about P4,000 (US$575). It is expected that as the pro-
gram progresses, the cost per project will gradually decrease.
2.18      Team Location and Performance.  Map No. 11420 indicates where the
50 MASICAP teams were located as of December 31, 1974. A tabulated summary
of project characteristics and the progress made in the first year of opera-
tions, on a regional basis, is provided in Appendix 4. A total of 231 pro-
jects have been undertaken with a nearly even division between new (122) and
expansion (109) projects. While MASICAP concentrates on projects in manu-
facturing industries, small agricultural and fisheries projects (e.g. pigger-
ies, poultry farming and fish ponds) and projects in service industries (e.g.
hotels, repair shops and cargo shipping) have also been accepted with a
broader view to assisting regional development. Of the 231 projects under-
taken, 190 (82%) are in manufacturing, 34 (15%) in agriculture and fishing,
and 7 (3%) in services.   The majority of the projects (70%) are channelled
to DBP for financing, and a smaller proportion (22%) to IGLF member-banks.
As would be expected with the lower limit on IGLF loans as compared to EBP,
the average size loan in manufacturing for DBP financing is P634,800, while
the average for IGLF is P164,900. Between November 1973-October 1974 a total



of 11 loans had been approved and 56 applications officially accepted
(i.e. application fee paid) by the financing institutions.  Of all the
projects accepted thus far by MASICAP, 46 have been dropped/deferred at
various stages due to lack of continued interest on the part of the
entrepreneur or insurmountable problems with the project uncovered during
the project study. During the early experimental phase of MASICAP opera-
tions (November 1973 to June 1974) the drop-out rate was 31%. The rate,
with improved project selection, however, has decreased in the July-
October 1974 period to 12%. Thus, excluding the projects dropped/deferred,
37% (68) of the MASICAP assisted project applications have already been
accepted (or loans approved) for financing. Based on the estimates of
total size projects, MASICAP has contributed to facilitating a total
investment of approximately P42.6 million. Roughly half of the 231
projects undertaken are still being processed by MASICAP teams. In
addition, as of October 1974, the new pipeline for the field teams totalled
149 projects which were well distributed throughout the regions.  With
demand for MASICAP services increasing at a rapid pace, about 20 additional
teams are to be recruited in the near future.
E. SKI Assistance Programs of Other Institutions
2.19      Besides DOI, the two institutions most active in SKI program
formulation, training and technical assistance are the Development Academy
of the Philippines and the University of the Philippines/Institute for
Small-Scale Industries.!/ Progr&ms in other government agencies (briefly
described below) are in the planning stage. In some cases specialized
SMI units have been very recently established, and are undertaking pre-
liminary investigation of the feasibility of projects in major problem areas
which act as constraints on the growth of SMI.
2.20      The Development Academy_ of the Philippines  was created in
May 1973, with the objective of providing training for top and middle level
executives engaged in various fields of development and of researching and
initiating projects in areas considered crucial to meeting national goals
of accelerated social and economic development. High priority has been given
to development of small and medium industries and at the request of the
President in October 1973 for formulation of a program to implement this
policy, the DAP staff drew up the plans for and carried through the creation
of the MASICAP project, consisting of an Information Unit, a Prototype Unit,
and an Assistance Unit. The Assistance Unit (field program), as already
discussed, was spun-off to the DOI. However, the units of the MASICAP
project devoted to providing information and industrial research in specialized
areas remain in the DAP. Assistance from the DAP/MASICAP project includes
gathering, preparation and dissemination of information u6eful to entre-
preneurs and agencies involved in small and medium-scale industries, docu-
mentation of success stories among small and medium-scale industrialists,
1/ With their training capacity and experience in the field of S141 develop-
ment, they will be instrumental in assisting the DOI in establishing and
staffing the Regional Technical Assistance Centers.



-9-
formulation of programmed instruction for the conduct of feasibility
studies for use in the provinces, and coordination with other agencies in
consultancy work related to these industries. In addition it will coordinate
with the Development Bank of the Philippines in persuading big businesses to
enter into sub-contracting arrangements with small and medium-scale industries.
2.21      The University of the Philippines/Institute for Small-Scale
Industries   (ISSI) was created in 1966 to provide training, consultancy,
and industrial research facilities for the development of SMI. Presently in
the midst of a transition, ISSI is being re-organized to better define and
co-ordinate its role with that of other SMI agencies. While, ISSI will con-
tinue to perform its original training, consultancy and research functions,
all its programs will be re-structured to meet the demands for the development
of small and medium-scale industries especially in the rural areas. The
various branches of the University of the Philippines will provide the base
for its provincial operations.
2.22      The Design Center of the Philippines   has incorporated into its
work program the following activities in support of the program for small
and medium-scale industries: product development, marketing assistance,
training services, incentives programs.  The Center will launch a registra-
tion project of industry producers and exporters to enable these producers
to avail of design assistance, export clearance, and other incentives given
to firms registered with the Design Center.
2.23      Food Terminal Inc. (FTI)   has also established a Small and
Medium-Scale Industries Unit under its Trading Operations Department. The
FTI will assist small and medium-scale industries in the local marketing
of their produce, trade products generated by these industries that are
within its capability to handle, provide storage facilities for food
commodities generated by these industries, and perform related functions
as directed by the proper authorities.
2.24      The Department of Trade.  In 1975 DOI expects to set up a Trade
Assistance Center to serve the marketing needs of small and medium-scale
industries.  The TAC will have provincial offices located preferably in
selected cities which will serve as the monitoring arm of the Bureau of
Foreign Trade, the Philippine International Trading Corporation, and the
Design Center Philippines. It will coordinate the marketing activities of
the various bureaus. For the domestic market, the Department, through its
Bureau of Domestic Trade and its provincial offices, will locate sources
of raw material requirements of small and medium-scale industries. The
Department will also assist industry producers in finding markets for
their products either locally or abroad, and establish a direct link with
the Bureau of Foreign Trade for foreign trade opportunities, market research,
and credit checking of importers. For the export market, the Department,
through its Bureau of Foreign Trade, will conduct foreign market research,
serve as link between exporters and foreign buyers, and disseminate and
coordinate trade information. A Commodity Section in the Bureau now advises



- 10 -
exporters on general market conditions and sales possibilities for specific
products and services while a documentation center serves to collect,
classify, store and retrieve trade, commercial and economic information,
based on international standards. The Department, along with the Philippine
Shippers Council, has also undertaken to assist exporters and producers of
small and medium-scale industry products in securing suitable cargo space
aboard ocean liners at reasonable rates.
2.25      The Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC)   under-
takes trading operations in a wide range of commodities and proposes to
extend its export marketing services to accommodate small and medium-scale
industries. It intends to follow through its promotional work by assisting
entrepreneurs in actual negotiations and trading arrangements with foreign
importers. The Corporation will also undertake the importation of capital
and raw materials which are necessary for small and medium-scale industry
operations and together with DOI will coordinate the shipping requirements
of these industries by pooling outgoing cargo into economically size lots
to secure lower freight rates.
2.26      The Board of Investments is concerned with providing incentives
for exporters and initiating and developing exports of non-traditional
products. Assistance rendered by the BOI is aimed at improving the
acceptability and marketability of products through improved production
processes, better pricing, quality standards, design and packaging.
2.27      The National Manpower and Youth Council (NMYC)   proposes to formu-
late curricula to address the labor training needs of small and medium-scale in-
dustries; to develop suitable training programs and set training targets for
workers in specific types of small or medium-scale industries. NMYC will
also set standards for levels of skill proficiency, develop methods for
measurement of training and formulate policies to effectively promote the
employment goals and objectives of the Council and related agencies. Ten
regional manpower development centers will shortly be created to serve the
training and promotional schemes of the SMI program.
2.28      Local Government.  Provincial and municipal governments are repre-
sented by the DLGCD on the inter-agency Commission. Directly or indirectly
they are to a large extent  responsible for determining which projects are
desirable for their communities. For this reason the general selection of
the type of small and medium scale industries and the identification of
the project and proponent are often decisions made by provincial governors
(or city mayors) assisted by their provincial development advisers.  4here
local governments do not yet have trained personnel to perform this task,
MASICAP teams have been asked to provide the necessary assistance.
