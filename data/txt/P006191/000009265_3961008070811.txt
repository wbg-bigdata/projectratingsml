MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA
FOR A POWER SECTOR REFORM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1     I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Bolivia for SDR 3.5 million, equivalent to US$5.1 million, on standard
International Development Association (IDA) terms, with a maturity of 40 years including a ten
year grace period. The Credit will assist in the financing of a Power Sector Reform Technical
Assistance Project to help complete the implementation of the reform and capitalization programs
of the power sector following the mandate of the Capitalization and Electricity Laws enacted in
March and December 1994. The Credit is an integral part of a lending program that IDA has
designed to support the Government of Bolivia's (GOB) reform of key sectors (Box 1).

3.    Bolivia's most serious challenge in its efforts to raise growth and reduce poverty in the next
five years is to remove the remaining barriers to investment by: (a) reducing and rationalizing the
role of the State through a set of second-generation structural and other reforms to phase out state
participation in productive sectors and strengthen the social agenda; (b) enhancing its capacity to
play the role of a policy maker and regulator; (c) eliminating most monopolies in the productive
sector, enhancing productivity and competitiveness, and fostering private investment; (d) deregulat-

Electricity Sector Background
5.     Sector Reform. The national electricity       Box3: ReformRationale
public enterprise, ENDE, has been effective in     . Historically, the structure and regulation of the
developing a generation and transmission system      electricity sector in Bolivia has: (i) provided
that offers technically reliable service in La Paz,  inadequate incentives for supply and demand
Santa Cruz, and Cochabamba (three largest            efficiency; (ii) led to distorted tariffs at the
regional and retail levels; (iii) T distracted an
cities). However, the organization of Bolivia's      inordinate amount of Government credit from
electricity sector as a whole is not well-suited to  greater economic impact activities; and (iv) stifled

tion, attract private investment to substitute for   hoc nature of License granting and renewal, the
inherent conflict of having ENDE in effect assume

restructuring strategy that is supported by the      system have substantially restrieted the extent of
electricity development. Through the: reform, the
proposed Credit (Box 3).                             BolivIan electricity sector is expected to continue
growingm in an economically improved fashion at a
6.     Reform Objectives. The main sector            rate of 7% per annum over the 1990s. Funding
for the Ii   investment needs of the sector
reform objectives are to provide an economic and       r
(generation alone requiring some US$400 million
reliable service to the greatest number of con-      during 1995-2000) is expected to come largely
sumers, with little Government intervention, and     from private sources as a result of the new legal
due regard to the environment. This objective        framework.
will be reached by promoting quality and effi-            -        -  -    -  -             of
ciency through competition and autonomous effective regulation, and attracting new sources of



- 3 -
private capital to support its development. To address the sector problems, and achieve a level of
efficiency necessary to support the economic and social development of the country, the Govern-
ment is undertaking a sectoral restructuring strategy.
7.     Reform fundamentals. One of the critical milestones required to initiate the reform
process--passage by Congress of a new Electricity Law--was achieved on December 21, 1994. This
Law mandates fundamental changes, inter alia: (i) the terms of reference of the sector regulatory
agency in line with the regulatory framework law of October 1994 which establishes regulatory
autonomy including the granting and monitoring of concessions; (ii) principles for tariff-setting; (iii)
the separation of generation, transmission and distribution functions into different companies,
including a prohibition on direct cross-ownership (for utilities integrated to the SIN); (iv) open
access to transmission and distribution; (v) the principle that future investment needs beyond the
reform transition period will be supplied by the private sector; and (vi) introducing anti-trust
provisions so that competition in the wholesale contract market is not undermined.
8.     Reform Progress. With the legal
framework now in place (Box 4) the GOB has         Box 4: Key Legislation
made substantial progress in the challenging

The proposed Credit will help the GOB achieve
the following milestones to complete the      --         -  
reform program of the power sector:
*   Fine tune the regulations of the Electricity Law, complete the environmental impact assessment
of the sector, and carry out transitory and institutional adjustment activities to support the sus-
tainability of the reforms;

*   Corporatize and/or divest from the smaller utilities of the NIS and of the Isolated Systems; and
* Capitalize the transmission assets of ENDE (ENDE-T) In line with recent valuable lessons from
reform processes carried out in neighboring countries, the Government wishes to divest from
ENDE's transmission assets after the sector has had ample opportunity to implement and debug the
load dispatch and wholesale market operations of the NIS in real-time and under commercially
sound and fair open-access conditions.
Project Objectives
9.     The project aims to assist the GOB complete the reform programs and ensure their sustain-
ability by (a) implementing the reforms mandated by the Capitalization and Electricity Laws
including refining the regulations of the applicable legal framework; (b) carrying out key transition
activities that would ensure the long term sustainability of the reforms; (c) completing the restruc-
turing of sector assets and corporatizing the smaller utilities of the Isolated Systems and (d)
completing the privatization of ENDE-T and the remaining GOB-owned power sector assets.
Project Description 
P   D rBox 5: The Transition.Pricing Strategy
10.    The project consists of four parts:               Since the end of the hyperluflation period in
1985, the level of power tariffs has produced
*  Part A (14% of total project cost - tpc):              a satWsfactory fmncialreturn at around

staffing and operating costs of the TG; and (2)      :ig for about 55% of consumption, requiring
studies to fine-tune the regulations of the Electricity   studies and adjustments. Based on the

power sector including identifying the environmental and social issues specific to ENDE-T; up-
dating the review of the pertinent environmental legal framework and making recommendations
to ensure the effective environmental regulation of the power sector, and preparing a report on
the progress made to date on, and existence of firm commitments to complete, implementing the
mitigation measures recommended under the assessment; (4) Institutional strengthening to en-
able the National Secretary of Energy (NSE) to coordinate and monitor the sector policy objec-

ergy balance and strategic energy mix in a privatized power sector, including the preparation of
the first least cost indicative investment plan for the power sector, and address social and envi-
ronmental issues in connection with power coverage extension policies and provision of energy
services to isolated communities; and (5) studies to design a strategy for sustainable energy de-
velopment of rural areas and to enable the GOB to carry out the strategy.
Part C (13% of tpc): "Restructuring the GOB-owned Utilities," includes completing the
unbundling of ENDE-T, and corporatizing the utilities of the Isolated Systems including diag-
nostic, audit, financial restructuring studies and evaluation of divestiture and privatization op-
tions; and
*  Part D (22% of tpc): "Capitalization and Privatization" consists of carrying out the divestiture
of ENDE-T and the phased or outright privatization of the utilities of the Isolated Systems with
the assistance of financial and legal advisors.
11.   A full description of the proposed project, including a breakdown of the estimated cost of
each of its four parts and the status of project preparation are shown in the Technical Annex
(Report P-6662-BO). The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1998, and the closing
date is December 31, 1998. The 40 month implementation period for this TA project is smaller than
the Region's average. It is justified because all the reform legal framework is already enacted, the
project is the last phase of the overall reform program which begun in May 1993, and the project
executing and procurement units are in place and operating (paras. 13-16) under other ongoing IDA
Credits already managing the Project Preparation Facility (PPF)" for this project.
12.   Costs and Financing. The total estimated cost of the project is US$7 million. Its financing
plan includes: (a) II)A's credit for US$5.1 million equivalent (73% of tpc) including the refinanc-
ing of US$1.42 million for a PPF will finance essential public sector requirements to achieve the
project's objectives; (b) US$150,000 (2.1% of tpc) from Energy Sector Management Assis-
tance Program (ESMAP) already assigned to an ongoing rural energy and power efficiency
development program; (c) US$90,000 (1.3% of tpc) from SE (Superintendency of Electricity) to
cofinance the fine-tuning of the regulations of the Electricity Law; (d) US$550,000 (7.8% of tpc)
from the private utilities of the National Interconnected System (NIS) to cofinance the pricing
and dispatch studies; and (e) US$1.11 million (15.8% of tpc) from GOB sources including about
US$0.74 million from budgetary allocations to cover value added taxes caused by the project and
about US$0.37 million corresponding to salaries of counterpart personnel from the reforming
utilities and GOB's agencies. Retroactive financing for US$500,000 will apply for eligible expendi-
tures made after June 30, 1995, according to IDA's procurement guidelines. Furthermore, and not
included in the total cost of the project, a Japanese Grant of Yen 51 million (about US$0.5 million)
financed preparatory project activities relating to the capitalization of ENDE-G and the initial set of
regulations to the Electricity Law. Schedule A to this Memorandum shows project costs and
financing plan.

activities for the proposed operation related, inter-alia to completion of the regulations of the electricity law;
transitory pricing arrangements for the first year of operations of the reformed sector; fees of financial and legal
advisors assisting in the capitalization of ENDE-G, and ELFEC; the consultants fees of the power sector reform
Technical Group; and the preparation of TORs for the studies to be carried out under the project..

Project Implementation
13.   Responsibility for implementing all components of the project relating to the capitalization
programs lies with the MOC (Ministry of Capitalization) through its NSC (National Secretariat of
Capitalization). Likewise the implementation responsibility for all components relating to sector
policy matters and institutional strengthening of the NSE (National Secretariat of Energy), envi-
ronmental sector issues, and rural energy development lies with the MOED (Ministry of Economic
Development) through its National Sub-Secretary of Energy (NSsE) under the NSE. The heads of
the NSC and NSsE, are experienced professionals with technical and management experience in the
private and public sectors. Those eventual matters of the reform and capitalization programs
affecting sectoral or cross-sectoral policies and or strategies, will be dealt through CODENA
(National Development Council--Consejo de Desarrollo Nacional) chaired by the President of
Bolivia and conformed by the principal sectoral Ministers. However, since the legal and regulatory
frameworks for the power sector have already been promulgated and the generation assets of the
sector have already been capitalized, it is envisaged that there would not be an active interaction
with CODENA.
14.   The TG, which will have the technical coordination responsibility under the project, will
coordinate the definition of tasks, preparation of Terms of Reference (TOR) and overseeing the
work of consultants, will assist the NSC and the NSsE in the implementation and reporting aspects
of the project. ENDE-T will be the local counterpart in the activities oriented to put in place the
national dispatch and operation of the wholesale power market (Part B2 of the project). Project
Administration and Procurement matters will be dealt with by the respective project units of each
Ministry: the PU (Procurement unit) under the NSC of the MOC and the PEU (Project Executing
Unit) under the NSE of the MOED.
15.   The TG was created in May 1993 to draft the Electricity Law. In December 1994, the TG
was given a wide mandate to implement the reforms stipulated in the Capitalization and Electricity
Laws in coordination with line Ministries. It consists of a team of five full-time senior professionals
with diverse expertise in the technical, regulatory, financial and legal aspects of the power sector.
With the preparation and lobbying support for the promulgation of the Electricity Law, and the
implementation of the Capitalization of ENDE-G, the TG has already established a credible track
record in the coordination of highly specialized TA to carry out complex sensitive tasks with very
tight deadlines. It is expected that the first regulators of the sector will come from the ranks of the
TG because of the valuable experience gained during the reform programs. ENDE-T is the Na-
tional Utility holding the assets of the National Interconnected System (NIS) -Transmission,
Dispatch and of the Isolated Systems which will be privatized or divested during project imple-
mentation. ENDE-T has retained the key members of ENDE's management, operations, and
project management teams, to ensure the prompt implementation and full debugging of the whole-
sale power market which is a pre-requisite for the capitalization of its transmission assets.
16.   The PU was setup in July 1994 to deal with the large number of consulting contracts related
to the capitalization and reform process of all productive sectors including power and being fi-
nanced under Cr.2647-BO (Regulatory Reform and Capitalization Technical Assistance Project).
The PEU in the NSE was created in March 28, 1995 to execute specific components of Credit



- 7 -
2762-BO (Hydrocarbon Sector Reform and Capitalization Technical Assistance Project). The PU
which has gained substantial experience since its creation in contracting services according to the
procurement guidelines of multilateral agencies, may assist the PEU as the latter builds up its own
experience. Since the formal responsibilities of the PU cover the scope and objectives of the project
no special Resolutions are required from the MOC to establish the PU's responsibilities under the
project. However, a Resolution from the MOED will be required to formalize the PEU's respon-
sibilities under the project. The Project Implementation Organization Chart is shown in Figure
1. The agreed Action Plan, Time Table, and Monitoring Indicators shown in Schedule B,
highlight the key aspects of project implementation. Schedule C shows the procurement methods
and the disbursement arrangements. Schedule D states the timetable of key project processing
events.
17.   Project Sustainability. The TA supported by the project has both engineering and institu-
tional objectives -- TA types (a) and (b). By helping complete the implementation of institutional
reforms which promote private sector participation, economic pricing and efficiency, environmental
protection, effective regulation, and divestiture of the Government from the sector, under already
promulgated enabling legislation (para. 8, Box 4) the project will help the Government establish
conditions for a sustainable operation and development of the power sector. The sustainability of
the reform and institutions would depend on the ability of the GOB to maintain the credibility of the
reform benefits to the key stakeholders which support them: the GOB, existing and prospective
investors, the workforce of the capitalizing utilities and medium and large consumers. This will
depend to a large extent on the ability of the GOB to hire and retain qualified staff for the SE, and
for the NSE to be strengthened under the project. It is expected that the well qualified and already
largely trained members of the TG will become members of the SE and of the NSE. Also, the
SIRESE Law provides for sustainable financial self-sufficiency and suitably staggered tenure of the
various regulatory Superintendents including the SE. The Electricity Law creates up to 1% sur-
charge on all sales of electricity to cover the expenses of the SE under yearly budgets reviewed by
the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Furthermore, funds are provided by Cr.2647-BO to support this
objective through the use of external consultants during the initial implementation of SIRESE and
for external and on the job training. While there is no formal cross-conditionality between CPAC
(para. 2, Box 1) and this Credit, performance indicators as shown in the Schedule B will be used to
monitor progress of GOB's policy actions supported by CPAC.
Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement
18.   The main lessons of similar operations successfully carried out recently and in progress in
Bolivia itself (supported by the ongoing Cr. 2647-BO and PPF-900-00-BO), and less recently in
neighboring countries have been taken into account in the design and implementation action plan of
the ongoing reform program, namely: .(a) development of strong project ownership and political
will of the principal stakeholders -- political decision makers, municipalities, the management and
shareholders of the larger public and privately owned utilities; (b) establishment of a Working
Group (the TG) with highly qualified, and motivated local professionals in charge of coordinating
and implementing the reform and divestiture programs in the sector; and (c) budgeting sufficient



- 8 -
resources to support the highly specialized technical assistance required to successfully implement
the program.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
19.   The rationale of the proposed operation is to help consolidate the privatization and reform
program for the power sector through supporting the implementation of both the legal and regula-
tory framework mandated by the Capitalization and Electricity Laws of March and December 1994,
and completing the privatization of the remaining GOB-owned transmission and distribution
utilities. The proposed project is consistent with the Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy
discussed by the Board on February 8, 1994, as well as the GOB's policy agenda, which aims to
phase out State participation in productive activities. Schedule E shows statements of IDA's
credits and IFC's investments in Bolivia.
Agreed Actions
20.   During negotiations agreements were reached on: (a) the arrangements for overall project
execution, administration, procurement, disbursement, including the initial and ceiling amounts
allocated to the two Special Accounts, auditing requirements and reporting under the project; (b)
assurances that the privatization of the transmission assets of ENDE or signing any long term
management contract therefor, will be carried out only after the suitability of the regulations of the
dispatch and market operation of the sector have been reviewed, and refined if required; (c) phasing
the pricing studies to enable the consultants to specifiy, and the main utilities to make available, the
metering equipment required to create the data base necessary to determine the cost structure of the
power service; and (d) conditions of disbursement for the project: (i) for Part B.2 of the Devel-
opment Credit Agreement (DCA), that ENDE has committed and budgeted 50% of its cost. and (ii)
for Parts A.2 and B.3 through B5 of the project, that the MOED has issued a Resolution, satisfac-
tory to IDA, expanding the scope of activities of the PEU established within the NSE to enable the
PEU to discharge its project execution, administrative, procurement, reporting and auditing func-
tions under the project.
21.   Effectiveness. Conditions of effectiveness of the Credit are: (a) board resolution from
ENDE-T setting conditions satisfactory to IDA under which it will provide such assistance as MOC
and MOED shall require; and (b) confirmation that the services of the current professional staff of
the TG, PU and PEU with qualifications and experience satisfactory to IDA, continue to be secured
under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.
22.   Environmental Aspects. The Project has an environmental category rating of"B". The
Project's environmental assessment encompasses two phases. Phase 1, completed in March 1995,
involved (i) an overview of the environmental legal and institutional framework associated with the
power sector, (ii) preparation of the draft environmental regulations for the power sector, (iii)
environmental audits of six power plants under the capitalization program, and (iv) preparation of
Terms of Reference (TOR) for the environmental audit of the Transmission Facilities ("T") and
operations of the National Interconnected System (NIS). The environmental audits covered such
issues as air emissions, wastewater discharges, waste management (e.g. storage and disposal),



asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), noise, and soil and groundwater contamination. The
audit reports included recommendations for environmental mitigation of the capitalized power
plants that will be implemented by the investors as agreed in the capitalization agreements signed in
June 1995. The Government is currently finalizing the final draft environmental regulations for the
power sector in Bolivia through incorporation of the IDAs comments.
23.   Phase 2. Activities to be conducted during Phase 2 will include environmental auditing of the
transmission facilities and operations of the NIS. The recommendations of these audit reports for
environmental mitigation will be implemented, in line with existing legislation and, as required, by the
GOB or by the investors as agreed in their respective capitalization or privatization agreements, in a
similar fashion as for the six power plants mentioned above (para. 20). Phase 2, which is funded by the
proposed Credit, is expected to be completed by June 1996.
24.   Poverty Category. No direct poverty implications.
25.   Program Objective Category. The project belongs to the category of Public Sector
Management and Private Sector Development.
26.   Participatory Approach. The successful implementation of the reform and capitalization
programs so far (para. 7, 8) has been due to the keen participatory approach, and resulting strong
program ownership, followed since the redefinition of the sector strategy and formulation of the
reform objectives back in February 1993. The principal sector stake-holders have been either
directly involved or intensely consulted during all stages of drafting the new Electricity Bill and
associated regulations through to the design of the capitalization strategy and drafting the legal
documents for the bidding and subscription of capitalized shares of the sector generation assets.
The stake-holders have been represented by high officials of the Govemment (SNE and MOC),
existing private investors in the sector (COBEE, CRE, Recently capitalized and privatized utilities
-- Guaracachi, Corani, Valle Hermoso, and ELFEC) and ENDE and from potential local and
international investors.
27.   Project Benefits. While the benefits of the power sector reform are not apt to exact quanti-
fication, the US$3 million of technical assistance already invested in the preparation of this project
(the drafting and enactment of the Electricity Law and its Regulations, and the capitalization of
ENDE-G and the privatization of ELFEC) have mobilized an impressive volume of private invest-
ment at margins well above the Book value of the respective assets. Through international com-
petitive bidding, ENDE-G's capitalization value of US$140 million and ELFEC shares sold to
private investors for US$50 million represented 40% and 25% over book value respectively. The
US$140 million of ENDE-G which is contractually earmarked to new investment in power genera-
tion is expected to mobilize a total of US$300 million into the sector in the next 5 years. The
consolidation of the reform and of the regulatory framework and the capitalization of the remaining
GOB-owned sector assets supported by the project will enable the sustainability of the gains made
thus far and help materialize those yet to be made.
28.   Other less direct but fundamental benefits will result from the policy and institutional
reforms supported by the project. The implementation of legal and regulatory reforms for the



- 10-
power sector and the strengthening of associated public institutions would improve efficiency and
enhance the relatively small track record of existing private investment in the sector attracting a
greater number of players. Economic pricing and completion of divestiture from GOB-owned
assets would eliminate a financial burden to the Govemment by allowing the sector to fund its own
investment needs. Replacing private for public investment in the power sector which has averaged
some 10% of public investment in the last 6 years, would result in higher economic growth, im-
proved fiscal performance and increased effectiveness of the public sector in meeting demands in
the social and other infrastructure sectors. Finally the distribution of shares resulting from ENDE's
capitalization may help expand and strengthen the national pension fund and create a capital
market.
29.   Beneficiaries. Greater efficiency from improved regulation and competition will directly
benefit existing and potential private power utilities and consumers. Indirectly, freeing government
resources for investment in the social sectors will benefit the vulnerable groups of the economy.
30.   Risks The main risk is that the groups benefiting from the existing public monopolies
(political leaders, labor unions, etc.) may have the ability to undermine the timing of the proposed
reforms. This risk is now smaller because the overall legal framework and first set of associated
regulations are already in place and the first structural change -- the capitalization of ENDE-G --,
was successfully carried out in mid 1995. The risk is expected to continue decreasing as the
capitalization and divestiture process advances further towards completion. Two major areas of
further potential risk are: (a) insufficient institutional capabilities to develop and enforce the
regulations needed for the successful implementation of the new sector structure; and (b) the
possibility of a slow response from the private sector once the initial lower-risk investments in
existing assets are completed. These risks will be significantly mitigated through: (i) training
funded by the proposed Credit; (ii) advice relating to incentives to promote entrance of new inves-
tors, and to the prudent use of Government guarantees; and (iii) incentives to private investors,
together with mechanisms designed to prevent abusive use of such guarantees and pre-established
rules for phasing them out.
Recommendation
31.   1 am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
International Development Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
