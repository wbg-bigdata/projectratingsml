BOLIVIA - POWER SECTOR REFORM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
TECHNICAL ANNEX - THE PROJECT
SECTION A: Detailed Project Description
1.    Background . The Bolivian Government is making extensive use of both internationally-
recruited and domestic consultants and advisors in the preparation and implementation of its re-
form and capitalization programs in the various sectors. The main reform milestones achieved so
far have been related to the preparation and promulgation of the legal regulatory framework of
the power sector, and much of the assistance received to date has been financed from various
sources. The Electricity Law enacted on December 21, 1994, was prepared during May 1993
through December 1994, with the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) and
the International Development Agency (IDA) assistance. The elaboration of key regulations and
the preparation of the generation assets of Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (ENDE) for capitali-
zation were supported by a Japanese Grant Facility, by a small Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB) grant, and by some of the proceeds of Cr. 2647-BO. The preparation of the key tasks of
the proposed operation is being supported by PPF 900-00-BO (MOP, Para. 11). The proposed
operation will fund the additional technical assistance required by the Secretary of Energy and
Ministry of Capitalization to carry out key reform transition activities and complete the reform
and capitalization programs.
2.    Project Components. The overall TA has been organized into four parts to support:
(A) the operations of the reform implementation unit - referred to as the Technical Group - and
the establishment of the regulatory system for the power sector; (B) the implementation of re-
form transition activities; (C) the completion of the restructuring of the Government of Bolivia
(GOB)-owned utilities; and (D) the completion of privatization or divestment from GOB-owned
utilities. The following section provides the detailed descriptions of each project component.
Part A: Operations of the Technical Group and strengthening the regulatory system for the
power sector
1) Technical Group: Supporting the Technical Group by means of providing the re-
sources necessary for the operations thereof, including staff and specialized consult-
ant services.
2) Strengthening of the Regulatory system: Assessment of the suitability of current
regulations to the Power Law (and if warranted, the pertinent provisions of the
regulations to the Sistema de Regulacion Sectorial (SIRESE) and Capitalization
Laws) in light of the experience gained in the operation of the NIS up to September
30, 1996 and, if so required by the assessment, putting into effect, through the ap-
propriate channels, amendments to such regulations, particularly on the following
subjects: pricing, dispatch, quality of service, penalties, rights of way, terms and
conditions for concessions and licenses and environmental aspects.



2
Part B: Transition requirements
1) Pricing studies: Execution of one or more pricing studies:
a) to review or determine, as required, the economic costs of: (i) generation in
the NIS (National Interconnected System); (ii) distribution in the NIS; and
(iii) of each IS (Isolated System) whose generation and distribution functions
could be integrated in the future;
b)  to determine the costs of the economically adapted transmission system and
subtransmission including the ancillary system reserve and reliability costs;
c)  to determine the economic costs of power supply at the retail distribution
level; and
d)  to determine a policy to provide life-line subsidies consisting with the regional
environs and causing a minimal impact to market price signals.
2) Wholesale power market: Putting in place phase I (the first of 2 phases) of the crea-
tion of the National Load Dispatch Committee (NLDC), the entity charged, pursuant
to the provisions of the Power Sector Law with implementing a wholesale power
market. Such Phase 1, will include the upgrading of the current regional national
load dispatch and transmission system to enable the prompt adaptation of the present
system to operate under the open access conditions and effective commercial prac-
tices, the detailed design of phase 2 and the following activities:
a)  adaptation of the existing optimization and commercial settlement software
and hardware of ENDE's Centro de Despacho de Carga (LDC);
b)  determination of the organization (including regulations such as those for pro-.
cedural and administrative operation), staffing and operating budget, all for
the LDC and NLDC for both phases I and 2;
c)  as a complement to Part A2 of the project, reviewing, and as required, making
recommendations for refining of the new dispatch rules, pricing and clearing
house functions of the NLDC in view of the experience gained in the first
months of operation of NIS and in line with the pertinent provisions of the
Power Sector Law;
d)  training of ENDE's personnel assigned to the LDC on load dispatch opera-
tional activities.
e)  determination of specifications for the procurement of metering and commu-
nications equipment to reinforce the existing dispatch facilities, and for assist-
ing in international competitive bidding processes; and
f)  designing in detail the configuration of the NLDC to be implemented under
phase 2, including: (i) determination of specifications for hardware and addi-
tional metering and communication systems and equipment therefor to be
procured under such phase 2; and (ii) preparation of terms of reference and
action plans for, and estimated costs of, implementation of phase 2.



3
3) Environmental Assessment (EA): Carrying out the second and final phase of the en-
vironmental assessment of the power sector under the terms of reference prepared
during the first phase (carried out under terms of reference dated August 19, 1994)
and which include the following principal tasks:
a)  the carrying out of (i) environmental audits and of those ENDE-owned diesel
fired plants designated for capitalization and not visited during the aforesaid
first phase (i.e. plants below 4 MW); and (ii) surveys and measurements re-
quired to develop detailed action plans to mitigate environmental impacts
identified during first phase and relating to asbestos, diesel-oil and noise con-
tamination by the plants designated for capitalization;
b)  the carrying out of audits of the specific environmental and social issues asso-
ciated with the existing transmission facilities of the NIS and preparation of
action plans to mitigate any adverse environmental impact revealed by each of
said audits in a manner consistent with the prevailing Borrower's environ-
mental legislation;
c)  a review of the most recent environmental policy activities of both the power
sector and the Borrower's Ministry of Sustainable Development and Environ-
ment (MOSD), development of recommendations for amendments to specific
items of draft regulations, and assessment of the effectiveness of the existing
and proposed framework for the implementation and enforcement of the Bor-
rower's environmental policy and legislation in the power sector; and
d)  a progress report on the mitigation work that was identified during the afore-
said first phase for the facilities of each of the three ENDE's capitalized gen-
erating companies, including a brief assessment of the obligations of said
capitalized generating companies to carry out said works under existing legis-
lation, environmental regulations and terms of their generation licenses.
4) Strengthening of the National Secretariat of Energy (NSE): Development of key
functions to enable NSE to coordinate and monitor the power sector policy objec-
tives, balance of energy supply and demand, and strategic energy mix, in urban and
rural areas, to promote new direct private investment in the power sector and to en-
sure the dissemination of sectoral statistics, including the following activities:
a)  development of a power sector strategic analysis capability to monitor and
adapt the sectoral policy objectives to evolving circumstances in a manner
consistent with the national energy strategy and legal framework, by means,
inter-alia, of: (i) the establishment and start-up operations of an unit charged
with the responsibility of developing power sector policy and promoting pri-
vate investment in the sector; (ii) the assessment of staff and other human re-
sources requirements for said unit as well as its operational physical require-
ments including computer hardware and software, database, and communica-
tion tools therefor; and (iii) executing, through such unit of the activities un-
der (b) through (e) below;



4
b)  (i) definition of the role of the public sector in ensuring the supply of electric-
ity in a privatized power sector, including public sector action regarding the
response of power utilities and private sector enterprises; (ii) execution of the
first indicative least cost investment plan for the power sector (with the assis-
tance of ENDE's LDC or NLDC referred to in Part B. 2 of the Project, as the
case may be) and of the procedures for harmonizing the national energy strat-
egy with the future indicative expansions plan(s) for the power sector; and (iii)
overviewing, and if necessary coordinating, the preparation of indicative least
cost investment plan(s) for the sector to promote private investment in new
power projects, including the planning criteria for addressing risk-associated
and environmental issues;
c)  establishment of: (i) a sectoral database and mechanisms to provide informa-
tion to developers regarding the recommendations resulting from the aforesaid
indicative expansion plan(s) and (ii) procedures for involving users and other
interested parties in decisions regarding power sector projects;
d)  addressing development, social and environmental issues in connection with
power supply in matters such as power coverage extensions policies, rural
electrification and service provision to isolated communities;
e)  securing sufficient funding for, and defining the scope for coordinating and
monitoring the execution of, specific power projects (including pre-feasibility
and feasibility studies) to support the indicative expansion plan(s) for the
sector, all in the framework of the Borrower's energy policy; and
f)  training for staff under the leadership of the unit referred to in para. 4)a)(i)
above, and acquisition and utilization of hardware and software for such unit
and laboratory equipment for the environmental section of the power sector.
5) Rural areas: Execution of one or more studies in the following areas in order to de-
sign a strategy to assure the energy development of smaller cities and rural areas,
and to enable the Borrower to carry out the strategy so designed:
a)  determination of options for financially sustainable rural energy development
mechanisms, particularly for the Beni region;
b)  establishment of economic and technical criteria for: (i) selecting and evaluat-
ing options and geographic areas for rural energy development; (ii) beneficiary
assessment; (iii) cost recovery and electricity pricing for both regulated and
unregulated consumers; (iv) rational and transparent subsidization criteria for
capital investment cost; and (v) evaluation of the scope for using non-
conventional local energy sources for electricity generation in areas where
grid extension is not economically justified; and



5
c) identification and evaluation of at least two viable projects for implementation
during the next five years in the framework of the Borrower's energy policy.
Part C: Restructuring the power utilities currently owned or controlled by the Borrower or
agencies thereof
Assisting NSE and the Ministry of Capitalization (MOC) in evaluating options and deter-
mining specific action plans to instill commercial and financial viability to ENDE, the existing dis-
tribution companies in Sucre and Potosi in which ENDE has an equity interest, and each utility
operating an IS, all through completion of their respective ongoing restructuring; and additionally,
implementation of institutional, management and financial restructuring, including:
1) diagnosing the relevant institutional, financial and commercial issues involved; and car-
rying out financial, technical and legal studies to assess the likely market value of the
net-worth of each ENDE and IS business unit and cost center; and
2) determining preliminary capitalization, and/or privatization and/or contracted manage-
ment strategies, including or not the prior creation of a MEC, and implementation of
improvement action plans which may include management contracts with utility op-
erations.
Part D: Capitalization and Privatization
I) Preparation, pursuant to the provisions of the Capitalization Law or the Privatization
Law, as the case may be, of divestment options based on the results of the carrying
out of Part C of the Project; and
2) Execution of the selected divestment option for each enterprise, including:
a) preparation of suitable investments prospectus or information memoranda;
b) execution of promotion investment seminars and workshops to attract poten-
tial investors;
c) determination of pre-qualification criteria, bidding procedures and of the re-
quired legal documents, including bidding documents;
d) assistance in bid analysis and evaluation and award recommendations;
e) assistance in contract drafting and negotiations; and
f) establishment of procedures for monitoring contract performance.
SECTION B: Project Administration and Implementation
Project Implementation
3.    Responsibility for implementing all components of the project relating to the capitalization
programs lies with the MOC (Ministry of Capitalization) through its NSC (National Secretariat
of Capitalization). Likewise the implementation responsibility for all components relating to sec-
tor policy matters and institutional strengthening of the NSE (National Secretariat of Energy),
environmental sector issues, and rural energy development lies with the MOED (Ministry of Eco-



6
nomic Development) through its National Sub-Secretary of Energy (NSsE) under the NSE. The
heads of the NSC and NSsE, are experienced professionals with technical and management expe-
rience in the private and public sectors. Those eventual matters of the reform and capitalization
programs affecting sectoral or cross-sectoral policies and or strategies, will be dealt through
CODENA (National Development Council--Consejo de Desarrollo Nacional) chaired by the
President of Bolivia and conformed by the principal sectoral Ministers. However, since the legal
and regulatory frameworks for the power sector have already been promulgated and the genera-
tion assets of the sector have already been capitalized, it is not envisaged that there would be an
active interaction with CODENA. The specific responsibilities for carrying out the various parts
of the project are:
*  MOC:    Parts Al, B1, B2, C, and D
*  MOED:  Parts A2, B3, B4, and B5
*  ENDE:   will assist the above agencies in carrying out all Parts of the project, par-
ticularly Parts BI, B2 and B3.
4.    The TG, which will have the technical coordination responsibility under the project, will
coordinate the definition of tasks, preparation of Terms of Reference (TOR) and overseeing the
work of consultants, will assist the NSC and the NSsE in the implementation and reporting as-
pects of the project. ENDE-T will be the local counterpart in the activities oriented to put in
place the national dispatch and operation of the wholesale power market (Part B2 of the project).
Project Administration and Procurement matters will be dealt with by the respective project units
of each Ministry: the PU (Procurement unit) under the NSC of the MOC and the PEU (Project
Executing Unit) under the NSE of the MOED.
5.    The TG was established by means of the Resolucion Ministerial No. 018/94, of December
13, 1994, of the MOC and Resolucion Bisecretarial No. 01/94 of December 14, 1994, of the NSE
and NSC. In December 1994, the TG was given a wide mandate to implement the reforms
stipulated in the Capitalization and Electricity Laws in coordination with line Ministries. It con-
sists of a team of five full-time senior professionals with diverse expertise in the technical, regula-
tory, financial and legal aspects of the power sector. With the preparation and lobbying support
for the promulgation of the Electricity Law, and the implementation of the Capitalization of
ENDE-G, the TG has already established a credible track record in the coordination of highly
specialized TA to carry out complex sensitive tasks with very tight deadlines. It is expected that
the first regulators of the sector will come from the ranks of the TG because of the valuable expe-
rience gained during the reform programs. ENDE-T is the National Utility holding the assets of
the National Interconnected System (NIS) -Transmission, Dispatch and of the Isolated Systems
which will be privatized or divested during project implementation. ENDE-T has retained the
key members of ENDE's management, operations, and project management teams, to ensure the
prompt implementation and full debugging of the wholesale power market which is a pre-requisite
for the capitalization of its transmission assets.
6.    The PU was setup in July 1994 to deal with the large number of consulting contracts re-
lated to the capitalization and reform process of all productive sectors including power and being
financed under Cr.2647-BO (Regulatory Reform and Capitalization Technical Assistance Project).



7
The PEU in the NSE was created by MOED's Ministerial Resolution of March 28, 1995 to exe-
cute specific components of Credit 2762-BO (Hydrocarbon Sector Reform and Capitalization
Technical Assistance Project). The PU which has gained substantial experience since its creation
in contracting services according to the procurement guidelines of multilateral agencies, may as-
sist the PEU as the latter builds up its own experience. Since the formal responsibilities of the PU
cover the scope and objectives of the project no special Resolutions are required from the MOC
to establish the PU' s responsibilities under the project. However, a Resolution from the MOED
will be required to formalize the PEU's responsibilities under the project. The Project Implemen-
tation Organization Chart is shown in Figure 1. The agreed Action Plan, Time Table. and
Monitoring indicators shown in Annex 1 highlight the key aspects of project implementation.
Schedule B of the MOP shows the procurement methods and the disbursement arrangements.
7.    Project monitoring will involve both a control of technical assistance output through prog-
ress reports and review meetings with consultants, and a control of timely implementation actions
by the MOC and MOED with the assistance of the TG. The outputs of the project are summa-
rized in the Action Plan and Project Performance matrix (Annex 1). The recipients of technical
assistance will be the institutions involved in sectoral reforms, namely the MOC, MOED, NSE,
the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Environment (MOSDE), the SE, ENDE, NLDC,
and the Government-owned smaller utilities.
8.    IDA staff will hold a project launch workshop shortly after loan signing to review startup
action plans and project administration and reporting requirements. The project will be super-
vised by IDA staff through receipt and review of the Annual Implementation Programs, monitor-
ing of Semi-Annual Implementation Reports and the program of supervision missions indicated in
Annex 7. A midterm review of the project to assess progress of major reforms and institutional
buildup pursued under the project and to determine the need for adjustments will be held during
the first quarter of CY97. Inputs needed to supervise the project are estimated to total about 23
staff-weeks during FY 95 and 96. Supervision will require the involvement of specialists in envi-
ronment, power sector regulation, energy economics, power pricing, power dispatch, and privati-
zation.
Project Preparation Status
9.    Except for Parts B2 and D, the TORs to carry out all project components are ready. De-
tail TORs for Part B2 which require a prior on-going diagnostic study are scheduled to be ready
by end- 1995. While the final TOR for Part D will be prepared during the implementation of Part
C, the preliminary scope and TORs for Part D were prepared using the vast experience gained by
the TG in the capitalization of ENDE-Generation and in the privatization of the Distribution Util-
ity of Cochabamba, ELFEC. Bidding for the most urgent parts of the project will start as soon as
final clearance is received from the respective Minister's office flagging, while still required, the
processing status of the supporting IDA Credit.

Procurement, Disbursement and Auditing
10.   Procurement: Procurement for services and goods relating to all Parts of the project will
be consistent with IDA guidelines and review procedures. Procurement for the project will be
carried out by the PU of the NSC under the MOC ( for Parts Al, B 1, B2, C, and D of the project)
and by the PEU of the NSE under the MOED (for Parts A2, B3, B4, and B5). Both units will be
assisted by the TG in all contractual, technical, and implementation aspects. Box I provides a
breakdown of project costs per type of expenditure. Table 2, indicates the procurement compo-
nents and disbursement categories

desk review has revealed a number                    TOT   431  186  341         5B1
of inconsistencies with Bank Guidelines, in particular with National Competitive Bidding (NCB)
and contracting of consultants. While no ICB is contemplated under this TA project, it bears
noting that special provisions are now being incorporated in all Credit Agreements with Bolivia to
address such inconsistencies. With respect to the procurement of consultants, the Credit Agree-
ment for this project stipulates that foreign consultants shall not be required: (a) to enter into
joint ventures with local consultants; (b) to legalize their proposals or any documentation related
thereto; and (c) to register in any local registry as a bidding prerequisite.
12.   The project will involve two categories of procurement: consultant services and goods.
Consultant services would be procured according to procedures consistent with "Bank Guidelines
for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (August 1981)." TOR for most of the ma-
jor consultant services to be financed under the proposed Credit have already been prepared by
the Government and agreed to by IDA, and are available in the Project Files. The Bank's stan-
dard forms of consultant contract are already being utilized by the Government and will also be
the norm under the proposed project, including a short form letter for direct contracting of indi-



9
vidual consultants for short-term assignments, and a model of Letter of Invitation (LOI) will also
be used in the selection of consulting firms.
13.   Procurement for goods will be consistent with the "Guidelines for Procurement under
IBRD Loans and Credits (January 1995)." Procurement will be carried out as follows: (a) Since
there will be no International Competitive Bidding, contracts valued at US$75,000 equivalent
or more without exceeding the equivalent of US$250,000 will be awarded under Limited Inter-
national Bidding to equipment manufacturers with established servicing facilities in Bolivia; (b)
contracts for goods such as office and laboratory equipment, computer hardware and software for
the NSE valued at less than US$75,000 will be awarded under International Shopping to
equipment manufacturers and suppliers with established servicing and assembly facilities in Bo-
livia; and (c) contracts for goods such as computer hardware and software for the SNE, and office
supplies and materials in packages valued at less than US$15,000 per contract and not exceeding
US$30,000 in the aggregate will be awarded under National Shopping to equipment manufac-
turers and suppliers with established servicing and assembly facilities in Bolivia.
14.   Prior review will be mandatory for all computer hardware and software contracts, and for
those contracts for other goods equal to or exceeding US$25,000 equivalent. Contracts for other
goods will be
subject to IDA post review. Submission of full documentation will be required for all contracts
subject to prior review promptly after their signing and prior to delivery to IDA of the first appli-
cation for withdrawal of funds from the Credit Account. For consultancy contracts with firms
valued at less than US$60,000 and with individual consultants valued at less than US$30,000
prior review will cover only TORs with the requirement to use model Letters of Invitation. Addi-
tionally, single-source selection of consulting firms; assignments of a critical nature, as reasonably
determined by the Association; amendments to contracts for the employment of consulting firms
raising the contract value to US$60,000 equivalent or above; or amendments to contracts for the
employment of individual consultants raising the contract value to US$30,000 equivalent or
above. Based on the above arrangements, IDA's prior review will cover about 80% of the con-
tracts financed by the Credit.
15.   Disbursement: As detailed in Schedule C of the MOP disbursements would be made
against: (a) 100 percent of costs of local and foreign consultants except for 50 percent for Part B2 of
the project; (b) 100 percent of training expenses; (c) 100 percent of CIF cost of imported goods and
84 percent of the ex-factory cost of local manufactured goods and of the cost of goods locally pro-
cured. Disbursements may be made against Statement of Expenditures (SOE's) for the following ex-
penditures: (a) contracts for goods other than computer hardware and software valued at US$5,000
equivalent or less; (b) contracts with firms for services including consultants and training for
US$60,000 equivalent or less and contracts valued at US$30,000 or less per individual to the extend
that such consultant's contracts are not subject to prior review (para. 13). For all contracts that exceed
the amount indicated above, full documentation is required. As applicable, the supporting documents
for SOE's will be retained by MOC and will be available for review by supervision missions upon re-
quest. All other requests for disbursements will require full documentation.

16.   Two Special Accounts will be established in the Central Bank, one for the MOC and the other
for the NSE. The total authorized allocation for both Special Accounts would be US$340,000 for the
MOC and US$170,000 for the NSE, respectively, with initial deposits to be made of US$150,000 and
US$100,000 respectively, and the maximum authorized allocation to be released when disbursements
reach, in respect of the corresponding parts of project, a level of US$ 600,000 and $ 400,000 respec-
tively. These amounts allocated for each Special Account and the initial deposit to each account were
confirmed during negotiations. Disbursements will be made under authorized signatures from a desig-
nated representative of the Borrower in accordance with IDA policies and procedures. Retroactive fi-
nancing for consultant services and related equipment procured under IDA guidelines after June 30,
1995 (but not more than one year after the date of signing) is proposed up to US$500,000 equivalent
to about 10% of the proposed amount of the Credit. The project is expected to be completed by June
30, 1998 and the closing date is December 31, 1998.
17.   Records and Auditing: Records and auditing will be the responsibility of each unit, the PU
and the PEU, which will establish separate accounts for each component and will monitor all expendi-
tures financed by this project. Project Accounts, the two Special Accounts and Statements of Ex-
penditures will be audited each year by independent auditors satisfactory to IDA and whose services
,will be financed under the proposed IDA Credit, and copies of the audit reports will be submitted to
the GOB and IDA within four months after the end of the fiscal year. In addition to financial auditing,
the PE and the PEU, under the coordination of the TG, will prepare separate full progress reports and
submit them to the GOB and IDA every six months within the fourth week following the end of each
semester. Each report will detail all project and related activities, report on the progress in relation to
agreed schedules and project milestones, and identify any problems which may have been encountered
and which could adversely affect the overall impact of the project. Detailed reporting requirements will
be established during the first supervision mission. These auditing and reporting requirements were
confirmed during negotiations.

Annex 2: THE ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY IN BOLIVIA
Introduction
1.    The Bolivian electricity supply industry (ESI) is relatively small with a total installed capacity of
783 MW, total generation in 1994 of 2879.2 GWh and total electricity sales (excluding auto producers) in
1994 of some 2260 GWh. Approximately 64% of the population is served by electricity and the annual per
capita consumption is some 320 kWh.
2.    The generating capacity in Bolivia comprises 306 MW of hydro (both run of the river and
reservoir) and 477 MW of thermal (both gas and diesel fired). In 1994, 48% of total generation in Bolivia
came from hydro stations and 52% from thermal stations. Bolivia has extensive energy resources for
power generation in the form of hydroelectric potential in the Andean mountain region and natural gas
reserves which are concentrated in the south-eastern regions of the country.
3     The ESI is divided into an interconnected system (the "National Interconnected System or "NIS")
and a number of Isolated Systems. The NIS covers the principal cities of Bolivia including La Paz,
Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, Oruro, Sucre and Potosi, which are interconnected by a network of 69, 115 and
230 kV transmission lines. The Isolated Systems cover Tarija, Villamontes, Yacuiba, Trinidad, Cobija and
less populated rural areas.
4.    The Bolivian ESI is made up of both vertically integrated and separated utilities with a mixture of
private and public ownership, including a number of cooperative distribution companies. Before the
capitalization of ENDE-G in August 1995 (Annex 4, para. 7) generation in Bolivia was dominated by
ENDE, the state owned utility (with an installed capacity of 495.1 MW), and COBEE, a private sector
company (with an installed capacity of 142.2 MW). other public generation and autoproduction made up
the remainder. The tables below indicate the respective participations in installed capacity and generation
in Bolivia at end 1994.

Trends in Supply and Demand
5.     Over the last quarter century both the supply of, and demand for, electricity in Bolivia has
increased substantially. As indicated in the figures below over the period since 1967 the installed capacity
in the country increased by three and a half times and total electricity production, from 655 GWh in 1967
to 2879.2 GWh in 1994. Over this period electricity consumption in Bolivia increased by an average of
5.6% per annum reaching 2470 GWh in 1994. During the 1960s and 1970s the majority of electricity was
produced by hydro plants. However the share of total production of thermal plant in Bolivia has increased
steadily to approximately 51.6% in 1994.

Industry Profitability and Pricing
7.     Since the 1960s unlike most unreformed power sectors in Latin America, the power sector in
Bolivia has been profitable. The sector has been operated around the 9% rate of return on the legal rate
base (based on revalued assets for public utilities, and on historical dollar values for private utilities)
allowed by the Electricity Code of 1968. Recent pricing studies indicate that while the price levels of
Generation are in line with economic costs those for transmission and distribution need a pricing structure
analysis to reflect the consumption load profile of consumers, and weed-out the effect of sunk costs and
obsolescence of some parts of the transmission assets.
8.     A full economic impact and affordability analysis resulting from the price adjustment to reflect full
economic costs mandated by the new Electricity Law, was carried out in February 1994 by London
Economics (Consultant - UK). The results indicate that the adjustments are not likely to have material
impacts on power demand as a whole nor on the life-line consumers who by in large are already paying
prices close to economic costs. The greater but manageable adjustment required will mainly affect medium
size low voltage consumers (domestic and commercial) which do not have critical affordability issues.
9.     The relatively small overall price adjustment that is expected to be required is not likely to alter the
power demand profile in any material way. Fuel substitution away from power is also unlikely because of
the forthcoming deregulation of fuel prices that would result from the reform of the hydrocarbon sector
slated for 1996. ESMAP expects to complete an economic impact analysis of the expected deregulation of
fuel prices during the first quarter of CY 1996.

Generation in the National Interconnected System
10.   The NIS dominates the ESI having a total installed capacity of 614.9 MW (and an Effective
Capacity of 547 MW) and total generation in 1994 was 2502.5 GWh. The NIS represented 79% of
installed capacity and 87% of electricity generation in Bolivia in 1994.
11.   The NIS currently comprises the northern system (La Paz), the central system (Oruro -
Cochabamba- Catavi), the southern system (Sucre-Potosi-Telemayu) and the eastern system (Santa Cruz).
The central and southern systems were interconnected in 1979, the northern system was incorporated in
1980 and the eastern system in 1989. The interconnected network includes transmission lines of 69, 115
and 230 kV. All of the assets of the Generators are located in the NIS.
12.    The participations in the installed capacity and generation in the NIS in 1994 were as follows

COBEE-BPC
13.   Before the unbundling of July 1995, the Compafia Boliviana de Energia Electrica, S.A. - Bolivian
Power Company Limited (COBEE) was a vertically integrated privately owned utility engaged in the
generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in La Paz and Oruro (where it acts through a
subsidiary). Since then, pursuant to the Law, it has unbundled into generation (COBEE) and Distribution
(ELECTROPAZ). Operating in Bolivia since 1925, COBEE begun to be quoted on the New York Stock
Exchange in November 1993. Until October 1994 Leucadia National Corporation was the principal
shareholder of the company, owning 17. 1 % of its common stock. In October 1994 Leucadia National
Corporation agreed to sell this shareholding to Liberty Power/Cogentrix Bolivia Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of Cogentrix Energy Inc. of the United States.



ANNEX 2
4 of 13
14.    The former COBEE operated through generation and distribution franchises. The current 40 year
generation franchise contract was signed in 1990 and the new distribution concession for the operation of
ELECTROPAZ in the La Paz area is currently being processed for a 25 year period.
15.    COBEE operates 13 power stations with an installed capacity of 142.2 MW, all run of the river
hydro plant on the Zongo and Miguillas rivers which are fed by snow and glacier meltwaters. These plants
represent some 18.2% of the country's and 23.1% of the NIS's installed capacity. In 1994 COBEE
produced 774.6 GWh of electricity (some 31% of the NIS's total). Nine of COBEE's Power stations serve
the city of La Paz having a maximum capacity of 112.5 MW and a firm capacity of 105 MW and four,
with a maximum capacity of 19.0 MW, serve the city of Oruro. Since 1980, COBEE had suspended its
plans to expand its generation capacity. The new owner however have begun investments to increase its
generating capacity with capacity expansions of some 61 MW in the Zongo Valley. It has also completed
pre-feasibility studies for a 140 MW expansion of its Miguillas generation facilities. The company also
operates transmission lines linking its plants and the distribution facilities of ELECTROPAZ, which in line
with the new legislation will have to be unbundled and sold to the NIS-Transmission Company.
YPFB and COMIBOL
16.   YPFB and COMIBOL are both autoproducers which are connected to the NIS. YPFB has two
plants: a 3 unit steam turbine plant totaling 12 MW in Cochabamba and a 3 unit gas turbine plant totaling
6.6 MW in Palmasola in Santa Cruz. COMIBOL has three hydroelectric plants totaling 9 MW on the
Yura river near Potosi and other plants totaling 2.5 MW. COMIBOL has an installed capacity greater
than its own requirements and delivers excess production to the NIS (30.8 GWh in 1994). YPFB has also
delivered small quantities of power to the NIS since 1990.

Transmission in the NIS After the Capitalization of ENDE-G
17.   Prior to Capitalization, the total assets of ENDE, according to its March 31, 1995 balance were
US$ 523.3 million. On April 1, 1995 ENDE's generation assets connected to the NIS were spun off into
three generators (CORANI S.A.M., GUARACACHI S.A.M. and VALLE HERMOSO S.A.M. -- see
Annex 4). ENDE then became a residual company (ENDE Residual) in charge of the isolated systems and
NIS transmission system with total assets of US$ 308.8 million. The table below summarizes the assets,
debt and equity of all business units before and after the spun-off.

From the above table it can be observed that 1/4 of ENDE has been capitalized (353.8-254.8 = 99million)
and that 3/4 remain to be capitalized and/or privatized (i.e.; ENDE's assets in the isolated systems and in
the transmission system of the NIS).
18.   A summary of each of the isolated systems is provided below in paras.  . This section
deals only with the transmission assets excluding the load dispatch center facilities which also belong to
ENDE Residual. The Electricity Law states that the load dispatch installations may be owned by the
transmission company but must be ring-fenced by a separate accounting system and by reporting to the
National Load Dispatch Commitee (NLDC). The NLDC can buy the dispatch assets from the transmission
company but in the meantime must pay a full cost recovery rent to the transmission company for the use of
its assets.
The National Interconnected System
19.   The interconnected transmission consists of:
i) High voltage network. The main high voltage network comprises the transmission lines of 1)
Guaracachi-Valle Hermoso-Vinto-EI Kenko; 2) Vinto-Potosi-Sucre and 3) Valle Hermoso-Catavi,
all of which operate at 230kV or 115kV. It also includes the 22 substations relating to those lines.
ii) Secondary transmission network. The secondary transmission lines consist of sections of the
network generally operated at 69kV, which link the high voltage network with more distant areas
that have relatively low electricity consumption rates or that are integrated into regional
distribution networks. This network comprises: 1) the line south of Potosi to Tupiza and other
lines near Potosi, 2) the line south-west of Catavi to Totoral and 3) the extension from Guracachi
to Buena Vista.

iii) Sub-Transmission Lines and Substations. The sub-transmission lines are those generally
operated at 25kV and whose function is to connect to the main grid customers and distribution
companies in areas with low levels of electricity demand.
20.    A summary of the transmission assets in the interconnected system (SIN) is set out below:

Divestiture Issues of ENDE-T
21.     With the implementation of the new tariff regime set out in the Electricity Law of 21 December
1994, the transmission system will obtain its revenues exclusively form the users of the network. The
table below shows the proportions of the total revenues estimated to be provided by the Tariff Income and
those estimated to come from the Transmission Toll. The table also indicates the estimated operating
income to be derived from the transmission assets as they currently appear in ENDE's books. It bears
noting that these assets include a substantial portion of stranded value resulting from important variations
in the demand mix and load connected to the NIS, particularly from areas whose mining industries have
either disappeared or been drastically curtailed. It is clear that any divestiture strategy has to identify and
separate the stranded assets from those that are economically profitable.
22.     The financial consultant who assisted in the capitalization of ENDE-G will propose a preliminary
divestiture strategy for ENDE-T by the end of 1995. The strategy is likely to require: (a) the identication
of the stranded assets; (b) the best timing for the divestiture taking into account the need to find a
sustainabale solution to the viability of the Isolated Systems whose generation needs, not always timely
paid, is currently supplied by ENDE; (c) the need to fully commission the operation of the NIS and to carry
out a thorough fine-tuning of the regulations of the NIS dispatch and operation of the wholesale power
market; and (d) the identification of the operation modality and residual ownership of the stranded assets
which will have an important bearing on the book and market value of the economically adapted
transmission assets.

Distribution in the NIS
23.    Distribution activities in the cities connected to the NIS are now carried out by ELECTROPAZ
(La Paz) and its subsidiary ELFEO (Oruro); CRE (Santa Cruz); the recently privatized ELFEC
(Cochabamba); the two in which ENDE has hareholdings:, CESSA (Sucre) and SEPSA )Potosi); and by a
number of smaller independent distribution companies and cooperatives. In addition to these distribution
companies there are numerous cooperatives and small distributors in the NIS. Separate from the NIS, there
are also small integrated companies that generate, distribute and sell electricity in remote areas of the
country. The principal Bolivian distribution companies ranked by numbers of customers are set out below
(at end - 1993).

(1) See paras.  below.
In addition to the sales by distribution companies, sales by ENDE and COBEE directly to mining and
industrial users amounted to 286.9 GWh in 1993.
24.    ELECTROPAZ is Bolivia's largest distributor of electricity and it's distribution areas include the
cities of La Paz and Oruro, through its 95% owned subsidiary ELFEO (Empresa de Luz y Fuerza
Electrica de Oruro S.A.). In 1993 COBEE (including through ELFEO) distributed electricity to
approximately 228,000 customers and sold approximately 779.6 GWh of electricity. To satisfy demand
for electricity in its concession areas COBEE purchased substantial quantities of capacity and electricity
from ENDE (and sold some energy to ENDE in off-peak periods). In 1994 it purchased capacity from
ENDE in the La Paz area representing 38.4% of its demand and made net purchases representing some
54.3 GWh (with gross purchases being 195.7 GWh). From August 1995 it will carry out similar
transactions directly with the distribution companies of the NIS in line with the new private structure of the
sector.
25.    ELFEC (Empresa de Luz y Fuerza de Cochabamba) the second largest distribution company in
terms of No. of customers and owned 70% by ENDE, after a one year preparation and promotion process,
was succesrfully privatized at the end of August 1995 through an ICB process. Out of four bidders, the



ANNEX 2
9 of 13
wiinning bid of the strategic investor at US$50 million, exceeded the net-worth book value of the company
by 25%.
26.    CRE (Cooperativa Rural de Electricidad) founded in 1962, is the second largest distribution
company in terms of energy sales. With a 7% historic ROR on its rate base and 10% overall energy
losses, CRE is also one of the most efficiently run utility in Bolivia. Also, with a 10% historic ten-year
growth rate, CRE is the fastest growing utility. CRE's management is enthusiastically introducing
strategic corporate changes to adapt to the challeges imposed by the new legal and regulatory framework
while maintaining its traditional efficiency edge.
27.    CESSA Compaiiia de Electricidad de Sucre S.A.) Coperativa Electrica Sucre S.A. (CESSA)
distributes electricity in the city of Sucre. It is part of the NIS, and purchases its energy in bulk, from from
the new owners of Ex-ENDE-G. CESSA was founded on July 9, 1951 with a capital subscription from the
State, the Municipality of Sucre (MUNI) and private investors. Up to December 1994 the equity
participation in CESSA was as follows:
Private Investors          69.0%
ENDE                        14.5%
MUNI                        14.5%
CORDECH*                     2.0%
*Development Corporation of Chuquisaca
CESSA obtained from Direcci6n Nacional de Electricidad (DINE) -- the regulatory entity which will be
phased out as soon as SIRESE becomes operational-- a provisional concession (Resolution DINE) to
provide electricity services for a period of 30 years. To date, the official Resolution formalizing CESSA's
concession has not been issued.
28.    Prior to privatization SEPSA needs to address the following principal issues: (a) formalize its
concession status according to the new legal framework; (b) normalize the status of its accounts receivable
with ENDE-Residual, MUNI and other State entities; (c) irprove its profitability by adjusting its tariff to
the economic values mandated by the Electricity Law; and (d) undertake an overall internal and financial
audit to present a clear view to potential investors.
29.    SEPSA (Servicios Electricos de Potosi) Servicios Electricos Potosi S.A. (SEPSA) is a public
utility that distributes electricity in the city of Potosi. It is part of the NIS, and purchases its energy in bulk
from, in block, from the new owners of Ex-ENDE-G. SEPSA was incorporated on June 23, 1969 with a
capital subscription from the Development Corporation of Potosi (CORDEPO), ENDE and the
Municipality of Potosi (MUNI). At December 1994 the shareholding in SEPSA was as follows:
CORDEPO             96.8%
ENDE                 2.1%
MUNI                 1.1%
SEPSA obtained from DINE a provisional concession (Resolution DINE) to provide electricity services for
30 years. Like CESSA, to date, , the official Resolution formalizing SEPSA's concession has not been
issued.

30. Prior to privatization SEPSA needs to address the following principal issues: (a) formalize its
concession status according to the new legal framework; (b) negotiate with the Treasury (TGN)a possible
capitalization of its debt with USAID; (c) normalize the status of its accounts receivable with ENDE and
other State entities; (d) improve its profitability by inter-alia reducing its energy losses and adjusting its
tariff to the economic values mandated by the Electricity Law; and (d) undertake an overall internal and
financial audit to present a clear view to potential investors
Isolated Systems
31.    Large areas of Bolivia are not covered by the interconnected system, and their existing supplies are
provided by isolated systems. At present the structure of the isolated system varies from one another.
Some are disaggregated with ENDE carrying out the generation function and with either a cooperative or
other company undertaking distribution and supply. In others, a single, vertically integrated organization
undertakes the generation, distribution and supply functions. The cost base of isolated systems varies
greatly depending on their size, customer mix and density and the availability and cost of fuel. The
economic and operational viability of those isolated systems currently supplied by ENDE, on an
uneconomic basis, will have to be revised to allow their operational and financial independence before
ENDE- Residual can be further divested. The corporatization and divestiture strategy of the Isolated
Systems must permit an adequate revenue to the utility to cover its costs, contribute to its expansion, and
produce a reasonable return on investment. such that it remains viable.
32.    The principal isolated systems in Bolivia with maximum demands in the range I MW to 8 MW are
the subsystems of:
*     Tarija
*     Trinidad
*      Cobija
*      Camargo
*      Riberalta, and
*      Camiri.
33.    Besides these systems, several small local public service systems with demands of less than I MW
are scattered throughout the country. The installed capacity in the isolated systems in 1992 was in the
order of 67 MW (44% of which is owned by ENDE), and represents around 9% of the total in Bolivia. In
the Tarija, Villamontes-Yacuiba, Trinidad and Cobija systems, ENDE owns and operates the main
generating plant with the distribution functions undertaken by regionally based companies.
34.   In Tarija generation is hydroelectric and thermal (fueled by natural gas), in Trinidad, Cobija and
Camargo the production is thermal using diesel plant, and in Camiri and Villamontes-Yacuiba gas fired
thermal plant is used. These subsystems are likely to remain isolated in the medium term. Several
autoproducers exist in Bolivia with a total installed capacity of 108.2 MW, 92.2 MW of which are not on
the interconnected system. Autogeneration represents almost 60% of the installed capacity which does not
supply the interconnected network.
35.    Prior to phased privatization or full divestiture, these Isolated Systems need to enhance their
marketability. To a greater or lesser extent they have to address the following issues:



ANNEX 2
11 of 13
*  formalize and adapt their concession status according to the new legal framework;
*  for SETAR only: negotiate with the Treasury (TGN) a possible capitalization of its debt with USAID,
Argentina (Salta State), and the Bolivian Central Bank;
*  normalize the status of their accounts receivable and payable with ENDE, municipalities and other
State entities;
*  for the distribution utilities: improve their profitability by inter-alia reducing energy losses and
adjusting their tariff to the economic values mandated by the Electricity Law;
*  for the generation utilities: evaluate the regional tariff impact of applying the rates mandated by the
Electricity Law, and if appropriate design a short term tariff adjustment program;
*  undertake an overall internal and financial audit to present a clear view to potential investors; and
*  decide on the most appropriate degree of integration required in each case prior to privatization.
36.   The table at the end of this annex provides a summary of key physical, operational, financial data
and and indication of the main types of issues that need to be addressed in the course of their respective
corporatizations and/or privatizations.
Tarija Subsystems
37.    SETAR (Servicios Electricos Tarija S.A.) distributes electricity in the cities of Tarija and its
surrounding areas (Central System) which includes the towns: Yacuiba, Villamontes, and Bermejo, and
generates and distributes electricity in the town of Entre Rios. The whole system is not Part of the NISand
the energy for the system is purchased in bulk from ENDE- Tarija (part of ENDE-Residual) except for
Entre-Rios which has its own generation. SETAR operates through five companies in separate subsystems.
Households consume the largest share of electricity (24.5 GWh), followed by commercial (5.1 GWh) and
industrial uses (3.9 GWh). Generation in Tarija is mixed. The hydro and thermal plants are all owned and
operated by ENDE. Expansion of the systems at Tarija and Villamontes-Yacuiba will be based on
generating units fueled by natural gas with capacities of around 2 MW and 5 MW, respectively. SETAR
was incorporated on April 7, 1969 with a capital subscription from the State, the Municipality of Tarija
(MUNI) and the Development Corporation of Tarija (CODETAR). Up to December 1994 the
shareholding in SETAR was as follows:
CODETAR              54.0%
ENDE                43.6%
MUNI                 2.4%
38.    ENDE-Tarija, part of ENDE Residual, is in charge of the generation of electricity in the
Tarija region which includes the city of Tarija and its surroundings (Tarija Central) since 1979,
Villamontes since 1981, Yacuiba since 1992 and Bermejo since October 1994. The subsystems of
Yacuiba and Villamontes were interconnected with each other at the end of 1993. The energy
generated by ENDE is sold in bulk to SETAR, which is in charge of the distribution of electricity
in all these cities. The generation of electricity in this system is with diesel engines in the Villa
Abaroa plants, gas in the Villamontes, Yacuiba and Bermejo plants, and hydro in San Jacinto and
Angosto.

Trinidad Subsystem (Beni)
39.    COSERELEC (Cooperativa de Servicios Electricos Trinidad LTDA) established as a cooperative
on September 5, 1967, distributes electricity in the city of Trinidad and its surrounding areas, purchases
bulk energy, from ENDE-Trinidad (part of ENDE-Residual) has a provisional supply concession in the
Beni region, and employs 55 staff. The cooperative has no generation capacity. Consumption in El Beni
follows a similar structure to that of Tarija. Households account for the largest share of consumption (7.5
GWh), followed by commercial (2.4 GWh) and industrial (1.8 GWh) uses. Generation is by diesel plant
owned and operated by ENDE. In Trinidad, until if and when natural gas is available, the expansion plan
will be based on diesel generating units, with capacities of about 3MW.
40.   ENDE-Trinidad (part of ENDE Residual) since 1981, is in charge of generating electricity in the
city of Trinidad, and sells its energy in bulk to COSERELEC, which is in charge of the distribution of
electricity in that city. The generation of electricity is with diesel engines located in Trinidad and Moxos.
Cobija Subsystem (Pando)
41.   The Cobija subsystem in the Pando area, previously owned by the Pando Development
Corporation (CORDEPANDO) is 100% owned by ENDE since August 1991, when ENDE was forced to
take over. It has 15 full time and 5 part time employees. The structure of consumption in Pando is similar
to that of Tarija and Beni. Households account for the largest share of consumption (53.5%), followed by
commercial (43%) and other uses(3.5%).
Riberalta Sub-System
CER (Cooperativa Electrica de Riberalta) has been in operation for over 30 years. Riberalta is a
community of approximately 46,000 inhabitants situated on the northern frontier of Bolivia with Brazil at
the confluence of the Madre de Dios and Rio Beni Rivers. The principal industries are brazil nut
production and wood processing. CER has been providing 24-hour services to the community for over 30
years. The plant is currently comprised of medium and high speed diesel engines with a total installed
capacity of approximately 1.5 MW. Diesel is transported overland and by river to the city to be used in
power production. Shortfalls in availability are often experienced during months of heavy rains due to the
frequent difficulties in transportation.
Although CER has had little assistance from the central government, the cooperative has managed to
maintain a fairly high level of reliability and provided electricity at more or less affordable prices. Electric
energy costs US$ 0.22 per kilowatt hour with no demand charges. But while the cooperative is solvent, it
does not have the financial means to make the necessary investments in additional generation capacity,
investmnents that are very important to the future of the economic growth of the community. Capacity will
need to double to be able to provide the energy required by local industry to meet the additional demand
that will be experienced through mechanisation of the brazil nut processing plants and sawmills.
Interconnection in the near future with the national grid is unrealistic, so the cooperative will have to plan
its own generation expansion for perhaps twenty years into the future. It will have to operate independently
of all other institutions for many years to come. While the cooperative has managed to provide power at
affordable prices to its members, and while it may be able to do so for some years into the future, it is
evident that assistance is required from a central agency, be it private or public.



ANNEX 2
13 of 13
In this case, while the cooperative has established an operational structure that is adequate for daily
functions, it has not been successful in solving longer term problems. There does not exist an institution
that has been established in Bolivia to assist in the process of electrification planning or financing, and
therefore in cases like this, the cooperative is left to its own means to seek the financial and technical
assistance for future expansion.

ANNEX 3: THE NEW LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
AND INDUSTRY STRUCTURE
The Electricity Law and New Industry Structure
1.            The Electricity Law, Law No. 1604 of 21 December 1994 replaces the 'Electricity
Code' enacted in 1968 and establishes new principles governing concessions, licenses, tariffs, rights
of wav, penalties, etc. This section summarizes the key provisions of the law. Regulations relating
to the electricity sector pursuant to the Electricity Law (para. 2.5) were enacted in June 1995.
Principles of the Law
2.     The Electricity Law sets out the following principles for the electricity industry:
*  efficiency: the correct and optimal allocation and utilization of resources in the supply
of electricity at minimum cost,
*  transparency: transparency in the regulatory system established in the SIRESE and
Electricity laws,
*  quality: compliance with the technical requirements to be established in the
Regulations.
-  continuity: a continuous electricity supply without unjustified interruptions;
-  adaptability: the use of modern technology and administrative systems to promote
quality and efficiency; and
*  neutrality: the impartial treatment of all electricity companies and consumers.
New Industry Structure
3.     The Law provides for the introduction (subject to the law) of a freely competitive
electricity market and the dissagregation of the electricity industry in the NIS into separate
generation, transmission, distribution and dispatch activities. The Isolated Systems may be
vertically integrated. A company in the NIS may only be engaged in one of generation,
transmission and distribution activities.
4.     The Law restricts the common ownership of generation, transmission and distribution.
Generation or distribution companies (or certain related entities) may not own any shares in, or
exercise management control of, a transmission company and transmission companies (or certain
related entities) may not own shares in, or exercise management control of, a generation or
distribution company. Similarly, a generation company (or certain related entities) may not own
any shares in, or exercise management control of, a distribution company and a distribution
company mav not own anv shares in, or exercise management control of, a generation company.
5.     Distributors connected to the NIS are not allowed to own, directly or indirectly, any
generating capacity, likewise generators are not allowed to own shares in distribution companies.
6.     The law also contains provisions relating to the relative size of generation companies and
stipulates that a generation company (or certain related entities) may not oun, directly or
indirectly, more than 35% of the installed capacity in the NIS (excluding capacity utilized for



ANNEX 3
2 of 6
electricity exports). However, the Superintendency of Electricity ("SE") can authorize temporary
exceptions to this limit.
7.    All generators in the NIS will be subject to dispatch by the Comite Nacional de Despacho
de Carga ("CNDC") and may enter into Electricity Supply Contracts ("ESCs") with other
generators, Distributors or Unregulated Consumers.
8.     Open access to transmission in the NIS will be available to all electricity companies and
Unregulated Consumers. A transmission company may not buy or sell electricity.
9.     The CNDC will be responsible for the coordination of generation, transmission and
dispatch in the NIS to achieve minimum cost. The CNDC will be formed by a representative of the
generation, transmission and distribution companies respectively, a representative of the
Unregulated Consumers and a representative of the SE. The dispatch center of the CNDC will be
owned by the transmission company owning the Trunk Interconnected System although the SE has
the power to order the creation of an independent company to owvn the dispatch center which would
be owned by the electricity companies and Unregulated Consumers. The Law provides for the full
recovery of the operating costs of dispatch and of managing the commrercial transactions of the
wholesale power market.
The functions of the CNDC include:
-  to plan the integrated operation of the NIS with the aim of satisfying demand through
secure, liable and minimum cost operation;
-  to carry out dispatch; to calculate the effective capacity of generators in the NIS; and
to calculate node prices in the NIS and present them to the SE for approval.
10.   In order to promote a rational utilization of primary resources in Bolivia, the Executive
Power may define the minimum participation of hydroelectric capacity in the NIS.
Institutional organization
11.    Under the Electricity Law the National Secretary of Energy (SNE) will propose general
regulations for approval by the Executive Power which will be applied by the SE. The National
Secretarv of Energy will also develop an indicative plan (which will be for reference purposes only)
i.e. a minimum cost plan for generation and transmission projects (which will include projects
proposed by any generators and the National Secretary of Energy), necessary to cover the next ten
years increase in electricity demand in the NIS. The SNE will normally update the indicative plan
on a yearly basis.
12.    The SE will act as the regulator of the electricity industry and will be headed by a
Superintendent. In addition to the general powers set out in the SIRESE Law (para. 18) the
Superintendent of Electricity will have the specific powers in the Electricity Law to:
*  protect consumers rights;
*  ensure that the activities of the electricity industry comply with the antimonopoly and
consumer protection provisions of the SIRESE, Electricity and Environmental Laws



ANNEX 3
3 of 6
and respective Regulations; grant and amend concessions, Licenses and provisional
licenses in line with these Regulations;
*  intervene in utilities which have not complied with the Electricity Law and its
Regulations;
*  apply the tariff and price setting procedures established in the Electricity Law and its
Regulations for generation, transmission and distribution and approve and regulate
maximum prices and tariffs;
* approve international interconnections and the export and import of electricity;
supervise the CNDC; and apply penalties.
13.    The operations of the SE and a proportionate part of the operating costs of the General
Superintendency will be financed by a regulatory levy to be paid by electricity companies which
cannot exceed 1 % of their sales revenues before indirect taxes. Their initial capital costs will be
co-financed by multilateral and bilateral loans and grants.
Concessions and Licenses
14.    Under the Electricity Law, Distributors and integrated companies in the Isolated Systems
will operate under the terms of public service concessions with a maximum period of 40 years.
Generators and Transmitters in the NIS will be authorized to operate by Licenses of indefinite
duration. Authority to conduct studies for certain new generation plants or transmission capacity
(utilizing natural resources, or public goods or requiring the imposition of rights of way) will
require a provisional license (which will provide a preferential right to obtain a License for the
project at a later stage). All concessions, Licenses and provisional licenses will be granted by the
SE through two alternative procedures being either at the request of interested parties or through
public tenders. The applicability of each procedure, the mechanisms for applying for concessions,
Licenses and provisional licenses and provisions relating to the termination and revocation of
concessions and Licenses are set out in the Electricity Law and Regulations.
15.    Distributors, under their concessions will have an obligation to satisfy all demand for
electricity in their concession area. To fulfill this obligation the law requires them to enter into
Electricity Supply Contracts (ESI) with generators covering a minimum of 80% of their maximum
demand for a minimum period of three years. The percentage and the period may be modified by
the SE.
Prices and Tariffs
16.    The Electricity Law and the Regulations provide for the introduction of a new system of
pricing and tariffs for the electricity sector based on marginal costs for Generation and
Transmission, and on price-cap (RPI - X) incentive regulation for Distribution.
Transitional Provisions
17.    The Electricity Law contains a number of transitional provisions governing the transition
from the existing to the new industry framework. These provisions include the following:
* that the dissaggregation of the industry in accordance with the law should be achieved within
18 months;



ANNEX 3
4 of6
*  that subject to certain exceptions, until 31 December 1999 generators currently operating in
the NIS and the CGCs (Capitalized Generating Companies) will have exclusivity in the
obtaining of new
*  generating licenses in the NIS. Up to 31 December 1998 the granting of Licenses for the
export of electricitv will be restricted to generators currently operating in the NIS and the
CGCs;
* that ENDE will cede to the CGCs certain ESCs;
*  that for a maximum period of seven years, the SE will define the procedures for implementing
the tariff provisions applicable to generation concessions granted prior to the coming into
effect of the law; and
*  that for a period of five years, consumers within the concession areas of Distributors which
wish to act as Unregulated Consumers must obtain the authorization of the SE.
THE SIRESE LAW AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
18.    Law No. 1600 of 28 October 1994 has established a new sectoral regulatory system for
Bolivia called the "Sistema de Regulaci6n Sectorial" or "SIRESE". This new sectoral regulation
covers the telecommunications, electricity, hydrocarbon, transport and water sectors and can be
expanded to cover other sectors in the future.
19.   The SIRESE has been created as an autonomous entity under the auspices of the Ministry
of Economic Development and is based on a two tier structure comprising a General
Superintendency and a series of Sectoral Superintendencies. The General Superintendency will
oversee the activities of the SIRESE and the Sectoral Superintendencies and will be headed by a
Superintendent General who, except during an initial transition period, will hold office for 7 years.
Each Sectoral Superintendency will be headed by a Sectoral Superintendent who will hold office,
except during an initial transition period, for a period of 5 years. The Superintendent General and
Sectoral Superintendents will be independent and are not allowed to have any economic interest in
the areas for which they are responsible.
20.    Both the General Superintendent and each of the Sectoral Superintendents will be
designated by the President of the Republic of Bolivia from among the groups of three candidates
proposed by a two thirds majority vote of the Senate.
21.    Although each of the new sectoral laws (such as the Electricity Law) will set out specific
powers for the Sectoral Superintendents, the SIRESE law sets out a number of general powers
including:
*  promoting competition and efficiency and investigating monopolistic, anti-competitive
and discriminatory practices against the public interest;
*  granting, modifying, renewing and deciding on the expiry or revocation of concessions
and licenses under the provisions of the sectoral law; overseeing the carrying out of
investment commitments;



ANNEX 3
5 of 6
*  approving and publishing prices and tariffs in accordance with the relevant sectoral
laws and supervising their correct application;
*  applying penalties where provided for in sectoral laws or in concession or license
contracts; and
*  processing complaints and claims by users, regulated companies and the state.
22.    Electricity sector companies will have a right to appeal to the Superintendent General
against decisions of the Superintendency of Electricity and a further right of appeal to the Supreme
Court.
23.    The SIRESE law contains a number of anti-monopolistic and competition provisions.
These provisions require that, except as provided for in sectoral laws and regulations, companies in
the electricity
and other regulated sectors must carry out their activities in a manner which promotes free
competition and must avoid acts which would impede, restrict or distort it. The law also provides
that companies in the electricity and other regulated sectors are prohibited from participating in
agreements or arrangements whose purpose or effect is to impede, restrict or distort free
competition through price fixing, control of production, markets, sources of supply or investments
or other similar activities. In addition, the law includes provisions to combat abusive and anti-
competitive commercial practices which are damaging to competitors, clients or users. Mergers of
competing companies subject to regulation are prohibited where they would establish, promote or
consolidate a dominant market position.
Secondary Legislation
24.    Detailed provisions implementing the Electricity Law are contained in secondary
legislation or Regulations. These were passed by supreme decree and any future revision do not
require Congressional approval.
25.   The main Regulations which will be implemented pursuant to the Electricity Law cover the
following areas:
*  Prices and Tariffs ('Precios y Tarifas')
*  Operation ('operacion')
*  Quality of supply ('Calidad de Suministro')
*  Infringements and Penalties ('Infracciones y Sanciones')
* Concessions and Licenses ('Concesiones y Licencias')
*  Rights of Way ('Servidumbres')
26.   In addition, Regulations will be implemented pursuant to the SIRESE Law governing the
creation of the General Superintendency and the Sectoral Superintendencies.
27.    The Regulations of the SIRESE Law are currently being finalized and final drafts have
been issued to the main stakeholders for comments. They are expected to be enacted before mid
1996.



ANNEX 3
6 of 6
ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION
28.   An environmental legislative and regulatory structure for Bolivia is in the course of being
developed. The Environmental Law No. 1333 of 27 April 1992 forms the basis for the system of
environmental legislation. Various regulations pursuant to the law (including regulations relating
to environmental impact assessments, air pollution, water pollution and the control and

29.   Other legislation which has been passed and is relevant to the environment includes:
*  the Law of Ministries ('Ley de Ministerios del Poder Ejecutivo') No. 1493 of 17 June
1993 and its regulations which identify the Ministry of Sustainable Development and
the Environment (the 'Ministerio de Desarrollo Sostenible y Medio Ambiente') as the
key governnent agency responsible for the conservation and protection of the
environment; and
*  the Regulation on the Disposal of Industrial Wastes to Bodies of Water No. 010/85 of
28 November 1990.

ANNEX 4: THE CAPITALIZATION AND BIDDING PROGRAM
OF GENERATION ASSETS
THE CAPITALIZATION CONCEPT
1.    As part of a wider ranging reform program, the Government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de
Lozada has introduced a Capitalization Program to transfer six of the most important state-owned
enterprises to the private sector. The six companies earmarked for capitalization are:
Company              Sector
ENDE          Electricity
YPFB          Oil and Gas
ENTEL         Telecommunications
LAB           Airline
ENFE          Railway
ENAF          Mining and Metallurgy
2.     The basis for this program is set out in the Capitalization Law No. 1554 of 21 March 1994. The
program has a number of aims, including:
*  to issue shares representing up to 50% holdings, and to transfer management control of, the six
companies to the private sector;
*  to bring into Bolivia significant amounts of fresh investment capital to fund infrastructure and
industrial development in the six sectors; and
*  to create national pension fund schemes to provide, for the first time, pensions to the entire
Bolivian people. This will be structured and regulated by a new pensions law.
3.     Under the Capitalization Program each of the enterprises to be Capitalized will first be transformed
into a mixed economy corporation (a "S.A.M."), that is a corporation owned partially by state and partially
by private interests (being initially workers in the company) since under Bolivian law only a corporation
can issue shares. An international tender will then be held to select the investor or group of investors which
will subscribe for new shares representing 50% of the share capital of the S.A.M.s. The subscribed capital
will be doubled by the issue of the new shares. The subscription moneys will be paid into the S.A.M.s and
will be available to fund future investments. The Government will receive no proceeds from the
Capitalizations and following the Capitalization, the S.A.M.'s will be converted into S.A.'s signaling the
end of the Governments participation as a shareholder in the companies.
4.     The work force of the state-owned company from which a S.A.M. is formed will be entitled to
subscribe for shares in the S.A.M. up to the amount of their Social Benefits. The remaining shares in the



ANNEX 4
2 of 4
S.A.M.s will be used to establish a new national pension fund scheme. These shares will be held initially
by the Trustee/Custodian, which will be a leading international bank in the provision of trustee and
custodian services. In due course, the Bolivian pension funds will wish to achieve liquidity for their
shareholdings in the capitalized companies to enable them to diversify their portfolios and satisfy their
obligations to pay pensions. It is therefore anticipated that each of the capitalized corporations will be
listed in due course on Bolivian and other stock exchanges.
5.     As a necessary adjunct to the Capitalization Program, the Government has introduced a new
regulatory regime covering the telecommunications, electricity, hydrocarbon, transport and water sectors.
The new SIRESE Law No. 1600 of 28 October 1994 which creates a new system of sectoral regulation
(the "Sistema de Regulacion Sectorial" or "SIRESE') is described in more detail in Annex 3, para. 18.
6.    In parallel with the Capitalization Program, a more traditional privatization program is being
implemented covering a variety of smaller state owned enterprises in activities ranging from agriculture and
cement to textiles and hotels.

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT OF
THE POWER SECTOR IN BOLIA (PHASE II)
INTRODUCTION
Under the proposed Capitalization and Reform of the Power Sector undertaken by the Government of Bolivia the
National Electricity Company (ENDE) is to capitalize its assets into the following business units: Gl, G2, G3 and
Transmission. To ensure that the proposed reform and ensuing legislation meets sound environmental guidelines,
the Government wishes to carry out an Environmental Assessment (EA) of the power sector in two phases.
The first phase - an environmental audit of ENDE's generating plant over 4 MW, and a full institutional and
legislative review - has been carried out by a Consultant. The environmental audits of the generating plant
included hydro-electric and thermal (diesel and gas) plants, and produced a series of action plans to address
significant issues of concern which were identified. The institutional study examined whether the institutional and
legal structure in place in Bolivia is sufficient to ensure sustainability and effective regulation of environmental
objectives after sector reform and the capitalization of ENDE.
These TOR relate to Phase 2 of work to be undertaken and reflect the findings of the Phase I study and the
progress that has been made in environmental policy and regulation since the completion of that work.
ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS AND REVIEW OF THE POWER SECTOR
Environmental audits completed for this study will comply with all environmental guidance, laws and regulations
of Bolivia as well as the World Bank requirements included in the Banks Operational Directive (OD) 4.01 of
October 1991 as applicable to environmental category "B" projects; whenever necessary other international
standards or guidelines will be used prior agreement within the Government and the Bank. The Consultant will
develop a thorough understanding of the power sector of Bolivia. The Consultant will obtain from ENDE
information on the existing power generating and transmission system and the expansion needs identified
(including the report prepared for Phase I of this study).
SCOPE OF WORK: The project comprises the following components:
Phase I of the Project identified particular concerns at those diesel fired plants which were visited. Phase II of the
project therefore includes environmental audits of those ENDE diesel fired plants not visited during Phase I (i.e.
plant below 4 MW).
. A detailed evaluation of the specific environmental and social issues associated with the existing Transmission
facilities of the main interconnected system.
* A review of the most recent environmental policy activities of both the power sector and the Ministry of
Sustainable Development and Environment and development of recommendations for amendments to specific
items of draft Regulations. In addition, the study will develop a practical and cost-effective framework for the
implementation and enforcement of Bolivian environmental policy and legislation.
* The carrying out of urgent work on the three G's that was identified during Phase I of the project.
The TASKS to be undertaken are described below:
Task 1.       The Consultant will evaluate specific environmental, safety and social issues associated with any
ENDE diesel fired plant under 4 MW which is designated for capitalization (this plant was not subject to audit
during Phase I of the project).
Task 2.       The Consultant will evaluate specific environmental and social issues associated with the existing
Transmission facilities of the main interconnected system, and, if needed, provide economic and cost-effective



ANNEX 5
2 of 2
recommendations with prioritized mitigatory measures, estimated costs and schedules, all in the form of an Annex
to be part of the capitalization agreement of ENDE's Transmission system. The study should include, but not be
limited to: an assessment of the methods and guidelines used by ENDE in the transmission planning process, the
implementation and effectiveness of those methods; an inspection of major sub-stations and other transmission
facilities; a review of on-going procedures for the maintenance of transmission facilities (vegetation control, oil
changing etc.) and any measures taken to mitigate environmental and social effects.
Task 3.        There exists a growing body of secondary environmental legislation to both the Electricity and
Environment Laws in Bolivia and the Consultant should assess whether, given the institutional structure, the
legislation will be effective in environmental regulation of the power sector. The Consultant will work with the
Environmental Unit in ENDE and the Regulation Project for the Environment Law in the Ministry of Sustainable
Development and Environment.
Task 4.        This task will involve an assessment of the most appropriate mechanism for the enforcement of
environment policy in Bolivia taking into account economic, political, technical and environmental considerations.
The work should concentrate on the power sector but consider the implications for environmental regulation of all
sectors. Both short term and long term considerations should be examined.
The work will focus on permitting, compliance checking and enforcement. Amendments and additions to existing
draft regulations will be suggested in order to allocate legal powers and establish the framework which will ensure
effective permitting, compliance and enforcement in the regulatory system. The Consultant will collaborate with
the relevant personnel in the Secretariat of Energy and the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Environment.
Task 5.        In order to ensure that the potential for problems between power stations and neighbors is
minimized, it is essential that development in areas surrounding stations is planned and controlled. Potential for
improvements in the planning and enforcement system were identified by Phase I of the study. The Consultant will
therefore undertake a review of planning legislation and enforcement as it relates to the zoning of industrial,
commercial and residential development. The Consultant should examine the ways in which this legislation is
linked to specific requirements for developers to consider environmental issues and controls (noise etc.) regardless
of whether full environmental assessments are required on the basis of the study the Consultant will suggest
appropriate changes in legislation, policy and/or institutional arrangements.
Task 6.        The Consultant will undertake environmental noise surveys at the Guaracachi, Valie Hermoso,
Aranjuez and (subject to operational status) Villa Abaroa plants. The surveys should evaluate the significance of
noise levels with respect to nearby residents and recommend suitable remedial measures if appropriate.
Task 7.        Concerns were raised during Phase I of the project with respect to soil and groundwater
contamination caused by leakage and spillage of diesel fuel and lubricating oils at several plants. The Consultant
will therefore evaluate the nature and extent of soil and groundwater contamination at the Trinidad, Villa Abaroa
and Guaracachi plants and recommend appropriate short term and, if necessary, long term remedial measures for
the identified contamination
Task 8.        Phase I of the project identified the presence of likely asbestos containing materials at several
plants. The Consultant will therefore under separate private contracts assist private utilities to undertaking
asbestos surveys, including sampling and analysis, at the Trinidad, Aranjuez and Villa Abaroa plants in order to
confirm the presence, extent and condition of asbestos. Survey findings as well as an asbestos management plan
describing the recommended measures for managing each identified asbestos-containing material should be
presented along with cost estimates.
Task 9.        The Consultant will undertake a program of environmental awareness and audit training for
ENDE plant management.
LOCATION: This project will be undertaken in Bolivia.
