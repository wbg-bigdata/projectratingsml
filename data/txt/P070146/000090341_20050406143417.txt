3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
The primary objective of the Pilot Emergency Labor Redeployment Project (PELRP) was to provide
ex-soldiers of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) with the means for self-reliant existence. The project had a
secondary objective which was to test different active labor market program measures to encourage
employment generation, small business creation for the benefit of ex-soldiers and to provide stimulus to
local training and consultancy firms.

The objectives of the PELRP need to be assessed in the context of the post-war environment in BH
characterized by generally low economic activity and high rates of unemployment. Although the post-war
growth had been strong and brought some improvement in incomes, national poverty rate remained at 20 %
and promoting sustainable growth and employment opportunities remained a challenge for BH.

Following the Dayton Peace Agreement of November 1995, an estimated 425,000 soldiers were
demobilized. Their reintegration into civilian life was facilitated by the Bank's Emergency Demobilization
and Reintegration Project (EDRP) which closed in September 1999. In the Madrid Agreement of 1998, the
two Entities, the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina (FBH) and Republika Srpska (RS), committed
themselves for a further reduction in force of 30 percent in two phases of 15 percent each in 1999 and
2000. The first reduction in force was accomplished by December 31, 1999 with the discharge of a
combined total of approximately 4,792 soldiers from the armed forces of the two BH entities. Another
5,160 soldiers were to be discharged at the end of 2000.
It was important that these ex-soldiers were reintegrated into civilian life and employment was seen as the
key to rebuilding lives and reintegration. However, ex-soldiers tended to have skills and employment profile
that put them under a disadvantage compared to the other unemployed persons. At the same time,
unemployment estimates ranged from one-third to over one-half of the economically active population. It
was perceived that without any form of assistance these ex-soldiers were likely to become unemployed
given their skills profile and high unemployment rates in BH which justified the importance and the need
for PELRP.

The objectives of PELRP were clear and responded to the government priorities of successfully
reintegrating ex-soldiers into civilian life through creating sustainable jobs. The objectives of PELRP were
consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of fostering private sector led growth and
employment and building social sustainability in BH since economic and social reintegration of ex-soldiers
into civilian life was vital for social sustainability given the large scale downsizing of the army following
the war. The objectives of the project were also in line with the Government's strategy of focusing on
reducing unemployment and generating the domestic and foreign resources to place the country on a path to
sustainable growth. This goal is also reflected in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper that was finalized
in 2004.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives were not revised.

3.3 Original Components:
The project had the following components. The design of project components was clearly related to
achieving the project's objectives.

Component 1: Counseling, Employment and Training. Cost ( US $ 14.45 million)




                                                       - 2 -

This component was to finance various reintegration services including counseling, employment, business
advisory services, access to financial services and farming, skills enhancement, and higher education.

This component was designed to offer comprehensive information and counseling services to all ex-soldiers
in such areas as pre-discharge orientation, professional orientation, (self-) employment opportunities, and
post-traumatic stress disorder as needed. Business advisory services would be made available for
ex-soldiers who chose to go into small-scale business or farming. Each beneficiary would be entitled to a
maximum amount allocated for each of the above mentioned activities, based on the experience under the
EDRP.     Service providers would participate under the Project under performance-based contractual
arrangements and would be eligible for technical assistance to strengthen their capacities.

Component 2: Project implementation. Cost : (US $ 3.06 million)

This component was to support project implementation by providing necessary equipment, financing
operating costs, financing technical assistance, and carrying out a staff development program. The project
would be implemented by the PIUs in both Entities, through extension staff and through demand based
service contracts with the service providers for counseling services, employment and business advisory
services and training services. This component was also to finance market assessments, beneficiary
assessments and impact evaluations.

3.4 Revised Components:
Projects components were not revised.


3.5 Quality at Entry:
The objectives of the project were consistent with the priorities of reducing unemployment and fostering
private sector growth in general, and successful reintegration of ex-soldiers into civilian life in particular.
The objectives were clearly in line with the CAS of fostering private sector led growth and employment.
Flexibility was incorporated into the project design as it was foreseen at appraisal that the activities might
need to be fine-tuned as required during project implementation. This was particularly important in a
project such as the PELRP which focused on being client oriented and would provide services to
ex-soldiers based on their demand. The strength of project design in terms of being able to respond to the
demands of the ex-soldiers was proven by the ability of the project to successfully expand the agricultural
activity during project implementation as a result of the high demand from ex-soldiers for assistance in
self-employment in agriculture. Also, at appraisal, the project team foresaw that an effective monitoring
and evaluation system would be key to successful implementation and included establishment of a
monitoring and evaluation system among the conditions for effectiveness.

The design of these components took into account the experiences from EDRP in BH. Among the key
lessons from the earlier project were that future outputs would need to better track information on each
ex-soldier before and after receiving assistance. The second project, therefore, included a socio-economic
survey in the form of questionnaire to be administered to the soldiers discharged in 1999 and to those
discharged in 2000. The survey was intended to be administered while the ex-soldiers were still in barracks.
This information would be used to profile the socio-economic background of each ex-soldier and would
serve as a living file to track the ex-soldiers' progress through the life of the project.

As indicated by the name of the project, the project was designed to be a pilot not only in terms of
reintegrating the targeted soldiers into civilian life but also in terms of testing active labor market measures
for employment creation. This would give the opportunity to policy makers in BH to learn what works and



                                                       - 3 -

what does not work and would provide them with the experience from the pilot project in dealing with
future downsizing operations both in the army and in state owned enterprises and in dealing with
unemployment in general.

The QAG assessed the project quality at entry in March 2001. The panel gave the project an overall
satisfactory rating. The main conclusions from the assessment were:

        The overall concept of the operation was found to be sound and the outcome to have positive
impact on the country.
        Strong aspects of the operation were the task team's strong dedication and excellent knowledge of
local conditions and strong support provided by regional managers and staff in the Sarajevo office.
        Project's focus on ex-soldiers would have benefited from including the soldiers' families.
        The PAD and other documents presented a comprehensive description of the project background
but limited information on implementation.
        In a post conflict environment, the second objective of identifying and initiating labor market
initiatives appeared overly ambitious.
        Where corruption was rampant, it was unrealistic for the Bank to attempt to ensure a transparent
procurement process by insisting on a prior review of every contract.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Achievement of objectives and outcomes under PELRP is rated as satisfactory. According to PIU records,
those who actually received assistance (7,278) accounted for 99% of those who were eligible (7,320
ex-soldiers, 5,080 from FBH and 2,240 from RS). Of the 7,278 who received assistance, 5,405 were
provided assistance in self-employment in agriculture, 192 in self-employment in small businesses, 1,493
received on the job training and 188 vocational training.

The satisfactory rating is also supported by the beneficiary assessment undertaken in May 2003 which
concluded that up to the time of the interview, 60% of demobilized soldiers had continued to engage in the
work that they have gained through PELRP after the expiration of the contract of the PELRP with the
employing firm or service provider. One of the findings of the final evaluation report on PELRP
beneficiaries in December 2004 is that 38.1% of the respondents are still engaged in the job they gained
through PELRP, 23.1% were engaged in the job they gained through PELRP but currently have an other
job and 38.8% are unemployed. The final evaluation report also concludes that generally the project
achieved its main objective of reintegrating demobilized soldiers into civilian life.

PIU database and information system shows that approximately 74% of ex-soldiers who received
assistance under PELRP were engaged in self-employment in agriculture. The conclusion from the
beneficiary assessment is that the average monthly incomes from self-employment in agriculture is the
lowest compared to other categories and that percentage of those that engage in additional jobs among those
who chose self-employment in agriculture is the highest. This is due to the fact that many of those that
chose self employment in agriculture based their decision on the capacity of other members of their
household who were engaged in agriculture as well as to existing farming homesteads. Irregularity of
incomes in self-employment in general and the above findings in particular raise the question as to the
independent sustainability of the jobs of those ex-soldiers who selected self-employment in agriculture.
However, it is important to keep in mind that the PELRP beneficiaries were mostly unskilled and with the
lowest level of education for whom it would probably be difficult to find jobs outside of their agriculture
homesteads and without the assistance of the project. The assistance for self-employment in agriculture



                                                     - 4 -

through PELRP helped ex-soldiers by providing assets in the form of livestock, veterinary assistance and
agriculture tools. This provided an opportunity for ex-soldiers and their families to strengthen modest
household incomes. It could be argued that this group of ex-soldiers would have fallen into poverty without
assistance. According to the midterm review, PELRP experience demonstrates that the household rather
than the ex-soldier determines the success of self-employment and that small scale agriculture is the prime
social safety net in BH.

The secondary objective of PELRP was to test different active labor market program measures to
encourage employment generation, small business creation for the benefit of ex-soldiers and to provide
stimulus to local training and consultancy firms. The project has successfully tested active labor market
interventions such as self-employment in agriculture, self-employment in small businesses, on the job
training and vocational training and provides lessons for future intervention. Testing different labor market
programs under PELRP provided with the information on what specifically works in BH as opposed to else
where in the world. The results from the PELRP illustrate that self-employment in agriculture is the new
form of social safety net in BH. This experience can be used in selecting appropriate labor market
programs for employment generation. In addition, the project helped to provide an accurate and up to date
picture of the job market which would contribute to the choice and design of future active labor market
interventions. A larger number of jobs were identified than the ex-soldiers were willing to take within the
context of PELRP which came as a surprise given the high official rates of unemployment. Also, during
implementation PIUs worked with service providers which contributed to their capacity in providing timely
and quality inputs to their clients.

4.2 Outputs by components:
Component 1: (Counseling, Employment and Training) is rated as satisfactory.

The PELRP provided assistance to 5868 ex-soldiers discharged under the Madrid Agreement. Only those
ex-soldiers who were officially registered unemployed, and who did not have access to pensions or to cash
benefits and those who were not subject to disciplinary measures were eligible for assistance from the
project. PELRP also served an additional number of ex-soldiers beyond the targeted ex-soldiers discharged
under Madrid Agreement in the last year of the project after the closing date was extended from September
2003 to September 2004.This group was a total of 999 ex-soldiers who never received any benefits from
any of the demobilization programs and were in need.         In addition, 411 unemployed who were not
ex-soldiers were provided with assistance through the PELRP. The list for this last group of beneficiaries
were received from the employment offices and helping this group in finding jobs also provided the
opportunity to test the experience from PELRP on a group of unemployed outside ex-soldiers.

The design of the component was flexible enough to expand the self-employment in agriculture activity
when there was a high demand from the ex-soldiers for self-employment in agriculture especially for
livestock.

Component 2: (Project Implementation) is rated satisfactory.

The implementation was undertaken by two entity level PIUs. In the RS, the Development and Employment
Foundation which had the experience of implementing several Bank financed projects remained the
implementing agency for PELRP. In the FBH, an entirely new PIU was set up to implement the PELRP.
With the dedication and commitment of the PIUs, monitoring and evaluation and financial management
systems were set and were operational which contributed to a smooth and successful implementation of
PELRP. The management information system was central to all activities under the project and was
constantly being updated.



                                                    - 5 -

Throughout project implementation, the PIUs worked with the extension agents who were the first points
of contact for the ex-soldiers and they could easily assess demand. The PIUs also contracted with service
providers in the provision of employment services.


4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Not applicable.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The overall institutional development impact is rated as modest.

Although PELRP was not aimed at directly supporting specific institutional and policy reforms, it
contributed to improvement of capacity through demonstration effect and increasing understanding by the
Government of labor market programs. In addition, throughout project implementation PIUs worked with
the extension agents who were the first points of contact for the ex-soldiers. By the end of the project, there
was a group of extension agents with good capacity to reach the unemployed, to find out about their needs
and skills and to refer them to the jobs that best fit their profiles. Also, performance-based contracting of
service providers during project implementation resulted in the formation of a network of service providers,
particularly in agriculture, in BH with improved capacity in providing timely and quality inputs to their
clients.

Furthermore, with the help of PELRP, the government came to realize that business processes and
procedures in the provision of employment services should be improved and that a database of unemployed
clients and their skills profiles, job vacancies and skill requirements and information on other income
earning opportunities is critical for success in the provision of employment services.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Tracking and locating ex-soldiers after they had been discharged was difficult because of constraints in
labor mobility in the country at the time of the project that restricted the placement of ex-soldiers. For
example jobs which were located in certain localities were not filled due to the fact that ex-soldiers who
could have taken those jobs belonged to the other entity.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Delays in the provision of counterpart financing in the FBH was an issue throughout the project which
caused delays in project implementation. This issue was not specific to PELRP and existed for all other
World Bank financed projects in the FBH.

Another issue that caused delays in project implementation was the reluctance of the government to
administer socio-economic surveys before ex-soldiers left their barracks. Soldiers discharged in 1999 did
not receive any structured information before leaving the barracks which would contribute to their
adjustment to the new civilian environment. For the second reduction in force in 2000, a pre-discharge
orientation program was included under counseling services at appraisal to give ex-soldiers a head start in
their new life. However, pre-discharge orientation and post traumatic disorder assessment that was to be
administered at the barracks were not implemented as ex-soldiers were not informed about their discharge



                                                       - 6 -

from the military until the last minute. This created problems and delayed implementation as extension
agents had to work backwards and invest much time and effort to track down and reach these ex-soldiers
(many had addresses that did not match those that were provided to the PIUs) who could have been reached
easily if the questionnaires could be implemented before soldiers left barracks.


5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The strong commitment of implementing agencies as reflected by the strong dedication of PIUs to their
work enabled the project to meet expectations in monitoring and evaluation, project coordination and
implementation. In the FBH, although the government changed three times, the PIU could still ensure
continuation of implementation. At one point when there was no Minister in between governments, the PIU
in the FBH undertook the leadership role to prevent any interruption in implementation. Existence of two
PIUs for project implementation created no problems as an impressive coordination and collaboration was
established between the two PIUs. While the PIU in the FBH had the sole responsibility for the PELRP and
could also provide policy advice to the management, the PIU in the RS which was also responsible for
implementing other projects was better equipped in terms of financial management and accounting
activities. Efficient coordination and communication between the two PIUs made it possible to complement
different strengths and increased the development impact.


5.4 Costs and financing:
The project cost was estimated at US$17.51 million equivalent at appraisal, with the IDA credit of US$15,
Dutch Trust Fund of US$1.01 million and a Government contribution of US$1.5 million. Following the
Board approval of the project, the contribution from the Durtch Fund increased to US$1.21 million and an
additional US$1.76 million was made available by the Norwegian Trust Fund. By the end of January 2005,
99.73 % of the credit was disbursed.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The project sustainability is rated likely. The project has tested labor market programs that work in BH and
could be extended to the general unemployed population. Through their PIUs the employment agencies
have acquired experience on evaluating provision of various active labor market programs. With further
training and improved capacity the employment institutes can continue to provide these services in the
future. The rating is also supported by the fact that 60% of those served by the project remain employed 2
years after receiving assistance

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The Government supported the preparation of the Second Employment Support Project (SESP) in BH
which became effective in December 2004. The primary objective of the new project is to expand on the
lessons learned under the PELRP and mainstream these within the employment services and to support
income earning opportunities for the unemployed. The secondary objective is to encourage and develop
capacity and competitiveness for effective employment services in the public and private sectors.

The SESP aims to support access to income earning opportunities and employment through active labor
market programs for individuals who meet an eligibility criteria and build capacity of institutions
responsible for employment services in the public and private sector by transferring experience of the
PELRP. The project would build on the experience of the PELRP but would move a step further in
strengthening the capacity of a selected number of employment service organizations in selected regions to
provide a range of services including counseling services, on the job training, self employment, in



                                                      - 7 -

agriculture and job fare/public works, business advisory services, maintaining up dated databases on
service providers, job vacancies, firms, training institutions and active job seekers, screening genuine active
job seekers, building the capacity of employment services in extension agents/counselors.

The two PELRP-PIUs would be responsible for transferring the experience under the first project to
employment institutions through selecting a number of their employment service offices and monitoring
their performance against agreed performance benchmarks. The new project would support the capacity
building of competitive employment services both in the private and public sector. Under the new project
institutionalization of provision of services is the target and responsibilities for implementation will be
moved to the agencies depending on their capacity.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
The project preparation is rated as satisfactory. The project represented an emergency response to the needs
of the government to reintegrate the ex-soldiers discharged under Madrid Agreement into civilian life.
Recognizing the urgency of the needs of the Government, the project was prepared rapidly.

One aspect which could have been improved during the preparation stage was to address the issue of
counterpart financing which subsequently was a problem in the FBH and which delayed implementation.
Unfortunately, the Bank did not discuss in more detail with the Government the issue of counterpart
financing during appraisal or negotiations. For example, the Bank could have ensured that adequate funds
are set aside for counterpart financing through including counterpart financing as a condition for
disbursement or the project could have been 100% Bank financed.

7.2 Supervision:
The Bank's supervision performance is rated as satisfactory The project received intensive supervision
during implementation and particularly until the monitoring and evaluation system and financial
management system were put in place. The Bank team had an excellent knowledge of local conditions and
conducted a number of field assessments during supervision missions and provided timely reports. Three
independent beneficiary assessments were conducted to assess beneficiary satisfaction                 and the
sustainability of the active labor market measures through a verification of how many ex-soldiers remained
in their jobs after their contracts expired. However, the Bank team did not adequately reflect this in the
project status reports which focused more on the number of ex-soldiers who received assistance from the
project rather than on the number of ex-soldiers still employed or self-employed one year after having
received assistance from the project which was specified as one of the key performance indicators.
.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall Bank performance is rated as satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower's performance in preparation is rated as satisfactory. There was strong commitment from the
Borrower to the project as was reflected in the close coordination and cooperation between the Bank and
the Borrower. The commitment was demonstrated by the timely staffing of PIUs with qualified personnel.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
Government implementation performance is rated as satisfactory. The financed activities under the project



                                                      - 8 -

were accomplished satisfactorily despite the initial delays in project effectiveness and minor delays in
implementation. Delays in the provision of counterpart financing in the FBH was an issue throughout the
project which caused delays in project implementation. Another reason for the delays was the reluctance of
the Government to administer socio-economic surveys and inform ex-soldiers about the assistance available
under PELRP before they were discharged and left the barracks. As a result the PIUs had to spend a
considerable amount of time in tracking the ex-soldiers, informing them about the assistance available
under PELRP and surveying their skills and interests. Despite the delays in implementation, by September
2003 almost all eligible soldiers discharged under Madrid Agreement were served and the project closing
date was extended one year to serve for an additional case load of ex-soldiers who have not gained
assistance under any of the programs.


7.6 Implementing Agency:
The implementing agency's performance is considered as satisfactory. Both PIUs were regular in
accounting for all project transactions and project management reports were regularly submitted to the
Bank on a quarterly basis within the required format and information. During the course of implementation,
both PIUs developed sound procurement management procedures and an appropriate procurement filing
system was established which responded to the needs of the project.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall borrower performance is considered as satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned

        Continuous updating of database system on job brokerage and labor market information is critical
for success. This includes a database of unemployed clients and their skills profiles, job vacancies and skill
requirements, and information on other income earning opportunities.

        Effective orientation and counseling is necessary before soldiers are discharged. Providing soldiers
with orientation and counseling as well as surveying their skills before discharge facilitates their
reintegration into civilian life and implementation of programs assisting them.

        Being demand driven, PELRP had the flexibility to respond to the individual needs and interests of
ex-soldiers which shows that employment services tailored to the individual needs of the unemployed in a
demand-driven scheme is an effective way to provide these services.

        In projects of this nature which provide employment services, it is important to set aside adequate
time for these programs to work effectively because job seekers who were employed with public
organizations previously find it hard to build trust towards employers in the private sector.

        Development of capacity of the private sector to provide timely and quality inputs including
technical assistance to clients in agriculture and in business was a key to successful support in self
employment.

        Enthusiastic and interested extension agents and/or counselors were pivotal to the success of the
project. They are central to the multi-directional informational flow between unemployed clients,
employers, other service providers and market information data base maintainers and analyzers.

l In an emergency situation, 100% financing by the Bank (no counterpart financing) may be desirable.

Additional Annex 9. Borrower's Contribution to the ICR

I        PROJECT OBJECTIVES

         In the Madrid Agreement of 1998, the two Entities, the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina (FBiH)
and Republika Srpska (RS) committed themselves for a further reduction in force of 30 percent in two
phases of 15 percent each in 1999 and 2000. The overall objective of the military downsizing was to
improve the policy environment through: (i) budgetary savings of 30 percent of the defense budget; (ii)
improved security in the region and sub-region; and (iii) increased mutual trust between the Entities.
Despite generally high unemployment rates, targeted assistance to ex-soldiers was justified because: (i)
ex-soldiers are an especially vulnerable group, and their economic problems needed to be addressed before
they turn into social problems; and (ii) their successful reintegration into peaceful civilian life was an
important contribution to enhancing security in the region.

         The primary Project development objective was to provide ex-soldiers with the means for
self-reliant existence. The Project focused on supporting the ex-soldiers in their ability to find employment
and to create sustainable jobs and businesses, redeploying as it were, ex-soldiers within the economically
active population.

         The secondary Project development objective was to test different active labor market measures
to encourage employment generation, small business creation for the benefit of ex-soldiers and providing
stimulus to local training and consultancy firms.

III      OUTPUTS BY COMPONENT 1 (Counseling, employment and training)

1a) Sub  component: On-the job training and employment

PIU SESER FBIH signed and coordinated 295 contracts with employers and 826 ex-soldiers were
employed and trained through these contracts.
RS DEF signed and coordinated 415 contracts with employers and 667 ex-soldiers were employed
and trained through these contracts.
In total, 710 contracts and 1493 employed ex-soldiers.



                                                      - 21 -

         Through the Project sub-component "On the Job Training and Employment" all ex-soldiers had the
opportunity to be employed by interested, economically active employers. PELRP did not created job
positions. PELRP provided proceeds to the employers that were employing ex-soldiers on the already
available positions. PELRP provided and offered possibility that all ex - soldiers employed by interested
employer were educated while they were working. This was the only way where ex- soldiers could provide
their existence. If they successfully completed special training and became qualified with the certain skills,
they had better possibility to stay on the job, even after expiring of the one - year employment contract
provided by PELRP. Over 40 % PELRP Project beneficiaries were not qualified working power, while the
rest were people with finished secondary school. However, all of them, after years spent in the Army,
needed certain adaptation period to the new work environment, and current market situation requested their
additional education and qualification.

         Public invitations for employers were published in local press. Interested employers were taking
over the PIU's tender documentation and were submitting technical and financial proposals, in the proposed
forms. After evaluation process, which was done according to established procedures, in a case of proposal
acceptance, PIU signed contract with employer. After signing of contract between PIU and employer, the
employer had a 15 days time for singing of employment contract with ex-soldiers. Employment contract
was signed on the period of one year and contented all provisions regulated by working law. Employer was
under obligation to register ex-soldiers at authorized authorities for pension and health insurance, as well as
to pay a salary and all taxes for pervious month until 20th day in the current month. That meant payment
of salaries and contributions, meal and transport. PIU's extension agents were submitting the monitoring
reports on training and employment in relevant companies during the employment contract period, 12
months, and employer was obligated to present all relevant documents regarding the duties in accordance to
contract.

         PELRP provided funds to the employers that employed ex-soldiers on the available positions.
Maximum money amount provided for the employment of one ex-soldier on the position in producing
branch is 6.000 KM, and for the position in non-producing branch 5.000 KM in FBiH, and 4.500 KM in
RS in all cases. 70% of that amount was contribution to the employer for his real costs related to the
on-the-job of the ex-soldier (instructor, raw materials, amortization, HTZ equipment, employee insurance,
etc.). 30% were stimulation funds for the employer that employed ex-soldier, and for the empowering
business capacities. Employer was selecting the way of transfer of proceeds after the contract was
effective. First way was monthly installments after receipt of the report. Second way was advance
payments where the employer was obligated to provide bank guarantee.


1 b) Sub  component: Vocational training

 PIU SESER signed and coordinated 145 contracts with ex-solders; within they were provided with
 support for additional vocational training;
RS DEF signed and coordinated 31 contracts with 43 ex-solders; within they were provided with
support for additional vocational training;
In total, 176 contracts and 188 vocationally trained ex-soldiers.



         Ex-soldiers were selecting type of education or additional training (courses) they wanted to attend.
Spectrum of interest of ex-soldiers was very wide: secondary school, faculty, courses of foreign languages,



                                                     - 22 -

computer courses, driving courses, course for welders, master degree etc... Interested ex-soldiers had to
provide PIU's with all necessary documentation, and after evaluation process, contract with ex-soldier has
been signed. Payments were toward the Institution and scholarships. Various kinds of vocational training
were aimed for ex-soldier's better possition at labor market and for his faster employment.

1 c) Sub  component: Self-employment in agriculture and small business

PIU SESER signed and coordinated 606 contracts with Servis providers for self-employed in
agriculture of 4057 ex-soldiers / 8 contracts with Service providers were signed for self-employment
of 52 ex-soldiers in small business.
RS DEF signed and coordinated 162 contracts with Servis providers for self-employed in
agriculture of 1348 ex-soldiers and 146 contracts with Service providers were signed for
self-employment of 141 ex-soldiers in small business.
In total, 768 contracts and 5405 self-employed ex-soldiers in agriculture and 154 contracts with
Service providers were signed for self-employment of 193 ex-soldiers in small business.

         All ex-soldiers who considered that independent agriculture activity or small business had been
enough for their successful reintegration into civilian life had the opportunity for self-employment through
PELRP project. Depending on the ex-soldier's wish that could be: cattle breeding, poultry framing,
apiculture, mushroom gathering, pig breeding, green housing, fruit-growing, small business etc. It was
necessary that ex-soldier had basic conditions for agriculture activity or small business (exp. Land or
registered business) so he could participate in this project activity.

         Ex-soldiers were provided with Initial resources and raw materials for agricultural activities or
small business, as well as necessary education and services in period of one year. All resources and raw
materials were PIU's property for the period of one year. After this period, if it was determined that
beneficiary has adopted all necessary knowledge for independent managing agricultural activity or small
business, initial resources became his property. Available proceeds for procurement of initial resources and
raw materials were 5.000 KM in FBIH and 4.500 KM in RS per one ex-soldier.

         Through Public Bids (Tenders), the total procured and delivered initial resources are:

FBIH: Motocultivators with plug-in 1.633 pcs; cows in calf 1.681 heads; bullocks for raising 388 heads;
sheep 8.911 heads; rams 200 heads; lambs 4.654 heads; pigs 29 heads; piglets for raising 6.254 heads;
hens 3.055 heads; chicken 19.784 heads; ostrich 9 heads; bee hives with other equipment 605 pieces;
greenhouses 70 pieces; fertilizer, peat and small inventory 16 completes; fruit nursery plants 1520 pieces;
various tools and equipment for small bussines;

RSDEF: motocultivators with plug-in and the other equipments for 387 ex-soldiers, heifers for 433
ex-soldiers, bullocks for raising for 67 ex-soldiers, sheeps and lambs for 291 ex-soldiers, pigs for 96
ex-soldiers and piglets for raising for 35 ex-soldiers, chicken for 16 ex-soldiers, bee hives with other
equipment for 7 ex-soldiers, greenhouses for 6 ex-soldiers, fruit nursery plants for 4 ex-soldiers etc.



         PIU was signing contracts with interested Service providers that have been mediating and
providing all necessary support in self-employment of ex-soldiers in agricultural and small business. Public
invitations for Service providers were published in local press. PIU's created Tender documentation which
has defined whole implementation process of this activity. All interested Service providers were taking over



                                                     - 23 -

tender documentation and in attached forms delivereing technical and financial proposals for mediation in
self-employment of ex-soldiers. PIU's were evaluating proposals, and in a case of acceptance, PIU's had
been signing contract with Service Providers. Compensation for Service provider was in range from 200 to
480 KM per one ex-soldier in depends to agriculture activity. Service provider selected way of money
transfer: payments in equal monthly amounts after report delivery, or advance payment.

         Mediation in self-employment meant: (i) estimation; (ii) mediation in procurement, delivery and
servicing of resources and raw materials, (iii) monitoring and reporting, (iv) education of ex-soldiers.
Service provider had to deliver report on capability of the ex-soldier to participate in project activity. He
was making contact with the ex-soldiers from the PIU's list and was estimating resources that are already
owned by ex-soldier (equipment, machines, property, objects, etc.) Also, based on profitability in concrete
agricultural branch, Service provider was estimating missing resources that had to be procured and
established. Service Provider was signing contracts with beneficiaries. Training process was eliminating. If
beneficiary was not preset during the training, he was excluded from the procurement process. Process of
monitoring of beneficiaries on monthly basis was very important segment of service provider activity.
Service provider was publishing Public invitations for procurement of Initial resources. The process of
selection of most adequate suppliers was completely transparent and in accordance with the WB
procedures. Committee was consisted of PIU's representative, Service provider and representatives of
beneficiaries. Commitee was evaluating all bids and awarding best bid that meet all required technical
specifications, and offer lowest price; Complete documentation of above mentioned process was delivered
to the PIU, and it was subject of approval.

VI       MAIN FACTORS AFFECTING THE IMPLEMENTATION

1.       Disorganized Discharge of FBiH /RS Army Soldiers

         a) In accordance with the taken over responsibility, the FBiH Ministry of Defense and the Ministry
of Defense RS were obliged (90 days before the discharge) to provide the World Bank and PIU's with a list
of soldiers who will be discharged. In that way, the important Project activity "Counseling and
Professional orientation" services could been offered to the identified soldiers, and in that manner they
could be prepared for reintegration into the civil life.

         b) Also, a socio-economic survey of ex-soldiers was implemented and Data base was established,
but collected data were insufficient base for planning and implementation of all Project activities.

         An important principle of this Project was volunteerism and the desire of the ex-soldier, and those
are exactly the type of data that the Data base was supposed to consist of. During the implementation of
PELRP it was important that the assistance and support for the ex-soldiers had to be individualized and
adapted to the needs and desires of each individual ex- soldier.

         The Ministries of Defense have not fulfill the responsibility they took over, and the important
components of the project: Counseling before the discharge and the professional orientation were not
realized. Furthermore, the discharged soldiers were not informed about the discharge in an adequate
manner, many of them were not given their work cards and decisions of discharge. Therefore, many of
them were not even aware that they were discharged from the Army; they thought that they were without an
assignment and were waiting for the new assignment schedule.
The unorganized discharge of soldiers and the tardiness in the identification of soldiers for discharge let to a
number of problems in the implementation of PELRP itself. The discharged soldiers were not informed
about the Project and the information about the beneficiaries had to be collected later, which led to the
tardiness in the implementation and caused additional expenses. PIUs were provided with inaccurate
information about the beneficiaries (the addresses and the phone numbers).

         PIU's were implementing a number of activities related to media and direct presentation of the
Project to the beneficiaries. An informative brochure and a poster have been made and distributed. PIU's
were constantly communicating through the press and electronic media, and through field agents, with the
objective of identifying the real number of available ex-soldiers and identifying their needs and desires,
which was an important condition for the successful implementation of PELRP. Along with other Project
activities, PIU's were constantly searching for new information on addresses and phone numbers by: the
engagement of PIU field agents, through the Employment institutes, Police Departments, Municipal
Departments of Defense, etc.




                                                      - 26 -

        Over 4000 ex-soldiers in FBiH (70% of the total number of beneficiaries) and over 2000
ex-soldiers in RS have received written invitations to meetings with PIU staff, and invitations were
delivered to their addresses by a courier. Over 100 meetings with ex soldiers were held across the FBiH
and over 70 across RS. On those meetings ex-soldiers were filling the questionnaire that has been
additionally created and through which they could select the type of assistance and support that they were
interested in.

        Due to overall above mentioned additional engagement, the PIU's recorded that: In FBiH out of the
7389 ex soldiers who were in the Data base, 3593 of them were not suitable to use the services of
assistance and support; In RS out of the 4838 ex-soldiers who were in the Data base, 2597 of them were
not suitable to use the services of assistance and support in FBIH.

        Eliminating criteria were: 1. According to the records of the Federal institute PIO/MIO it was
registered that they were already employed; 2. They had temporary residence abroad; 3. According to the
information of the FBiH Ministry of Defense they received a one-time severance-payment in the amount of
10,000KM / they were returned into active service/ or they have retired;
In RS eliminatig criterias were: 1. Employed (888), pensionary (599), reemployed in Army (532),

2.      Additional group of beneficiaries (FBIH only)

        Rational approach and respecting criterias in estimating of capability of ex-soldiers to participate
in Project resulted with financial savings.

        FBiH Government made a decision V. Number 74/2004 dated 12.01.2004, on including additional
group of beneficiaries in PELRP Project. First Additional group were: 2418 Ex-soldiers discharged in
period 1997  2002. Respecting same criteria as for the main group, PIU FBIH has identified that out of
2418 ex-soldiers, 934 were to suitable to recive help within PELRP. That approach for the second time
resulted with the financial savings. Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Policy, WB Mission and PIU
SESER proposed and FBiH Government approved that remaining financial amount can be used in
providing services for 350 unemployed persons nominated by Employment institutes, from all 10 FBIH
Cantons. Services were provided according to the already established criteria and procedures, and in
addition services were provided in close collaboration with the Employment institutes, as an introduction of
the SESP, Second Employment Support Project.

VII     SUSTAINABILITY / LESSONS LEARNED

l Socio  economic situation, disordered labor market, missing legislatives, were the facts with direct
    influence on PELRP, where the Project could not significantly affect the environment, which was a
    base for success and meeting objectives.
l It is very important to establish good quality criteria on employment status and criteria of selection on
    the basis of social status.
l Since the Project was aimed exclusively at the Market demands, the real effects could be expected only
    after successful match of job vacancies and labor force. That means preparation and training
    beneficiaries to successfully respond to market demands, respecting mutual interests.
l There has been great distrust in employment with private owners. Actually, that perception is
    inheritance of previous period when jobs were life long. Project supported change of mentality in a way
    of accepting Private sector and fact that the State can not provide jobs permanently.
l Active labor market measures should be directed to the already available job position with the labor

  market determinate salary, instead of one-time service payments.
l Project has flexible approach to active labor market interventions and shows that active labor market
  measures such as those under the PELRP can work in Bosnia and Herzegovina today. An impressive
  number of jobs have been identified by the two PIUs  in fact, significantly three times more than
  ex-soldiers were willing to take.
l PELRP target group was very specific, and beneficiaries were not willing to change their place of
  original according to the labor market demands.
l Self-employment in agriculture is informal net of Social security in BiH, and it is necessary to explore
  all the possibilities of including it into formal Sector.
l It is important to create Database on beneficiaries, which will serve as basis for planning Project
  components, activities and procedures. The unorganized discharge of soldiers and missing basic
  information on ex-soldiers caused numerous problems in the realization of PELRP itself. The
  discharged soldiers were not informed about the Project and the information about the beneficiaries had
  to be collected later.
l Beneficiaries need to be provided with counseling and information on all aspects of Project, which
  means more aggressive and continuous approach to them.
l To ensure Project implementation, it is necessary to have Government co-financing on regular basis,
  because in opposite, it could lead to the delays in implementation.
