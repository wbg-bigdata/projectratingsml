APPRAISAL OF SIXTH POWER PROJECT
PORTUGAL
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a Project comprising the investment program
for the Portuguese power sector in the period 1976-78, for which the Govern-
ment has requested Bank financing. The Project would form part of the develop-
ment program for the power sector to meet the forecast growth of demand in
the period 1976-86. The estimated cost of the Project is US$1,124 million
equivalent (including a contingency for future price increases, but excluding
interest during construction), of which US$380 million would be for foreign
costs. A Bank loan of US$36 million (9% of the foreign cost) is proposed.
The loan would be made to Electricidade de Portugal - Empresa Publica (EdP),
the national power entity to be established July 1, 1976 amalgamating 15
companies engaged in power generation, transmission and distribution, which
were nationalized in April 1975.
ii.       The financing plan is not firm because arrangements have yet to be
made for: (i) US$72 million equivalent (excluding the proposed Bank loan of
US$36 million) out of the total direct foreign exchange requirements of US$172
million; and (ii) about 70% of local financing (US$423 million equivalent).
Government would provide the required funds in the event of EdP's inability to
secure them.
iii.      The Bank has made five previous loans, totalling US$57.5 million,
for power sector development in Portugal, all in the period 1962-66. Two of
the loans were for hydropower projects and three for thermal power stations.
The loans were made to two different undertakings which will form part of EdP.
All the projects were successfully completed and are in operation.
iv.       Public electricity supply, which accounts for about 95% of total
electricity production in Portugal, rose from 4,496 GWh in 1964 to 10,065
GWh in 1974 (about 9% p.a.). Installed capacity in the public supply indus-
try rose over the same period from 1,468 MW to 2,797 MW. Production is proj-
ected to increase to 24,170 GWh in 1986 (8.2% p.a.) and installed capacity
to 6,918 MW.
v.        The Project includes facilities under construction at January 1,
1976 or to be started prior to the end of 1978. These comprise 3,302 MW of
generating capacity (1,562 MW hydro, 1,740 MW of thermal plant); 2,890 km of
transmission lines; 10,525 MVA of substation capacity; and the expansion of
existing distribution networks, including rural electrification.



- ii -
vi.       EdP, the proposed entity responsible for implementing the program,
will have to address itself to a large number of problems, some of which arise
out of the need to apply uniform policies and procedures in entities hitherto
following diverse practices. Some of the more important problems are:
(a) organizing itself to function as an autonomous entity;
(b) rationalization of tariffs which vary widely over the countrv;
(c)   application of common personnel policies and wages and salaries;
(d) unification of finance and accounting systems;
(e) phased integration of about 200 municipal power distribution
units, and
(f) perhaps most important of all, setting up a satisfactory fi-
nancing plan to cover the development program.
Compensation to stockholders of the nationalized companies, already declared
in principle in the nationalization decree, also needs to be determined
quickly by Government; legislative approval of compensation proposals is
expected late summer of 1976 or thereabouts. The total amount payable to
foreign stockholders may be in the neighborhood of US$20 million equivalent.
Likewise, compensation to a Spanish company for the take-over of its assets
needs to be settled in negotiations with the company, which are underwav.
vii.      Procurement of items to be financed from the loan would be on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement. A preference of 15% or applicable duties, which-
ever is less, would be granted to Portuguese manufacturers who participate.
Disbursements would be made for the c.i.f. cost of imported items or ex-
factorv cost of items under contracts won by Portuguese manufacturers, and
for the cost of related engineering services.
viii.     Government considers that achievement of a self-financing level of
at least 30% of construction requirements would be a satisfactory objective
for EdP from 1979 onwards and that objectives for 1977 and 1978 should be so
Lixed as to enable EdP to achieve at least 30,' self-financing from 1979 on-
wards. Government would establish in consultation with EdP before December 31,
1976 financial objectives for EdP satisfactorv to the Bank.
ix.       The development program of wnich the Project forms part is the
least-cost means of meeting the projected growthi of demand at discount rates
up to 13.8%. The estimated rate of return on the development program is at
least 4.1% valuing benefits at electricitv rates in effect June 1, 1976; it
would be 8.3% using rates which are expected to be in effect over the Project
period.



- iii -
x.        In view of the agreements reached as set forth in Section 8, the
Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$36 million to EdP, for a term of 15
years including a 3-year grace period. The loan could be effective within
three months of signing of the Loan Agreement.






APPRAISAL OF SIXTH POWER PROJECT
PORTUGAL
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Portugal has requested the Bank to help finance
a Project comprising the development program for the power sector in the
period 1976-78, estimated to cost US$1,124 million equivalent. The program
includes generation, transmission and distribution facilities already under
construction as of January 1, 1976 or to be installed in the period 1976-78.
A loan of US$36 million is proposed to Electricidade de Portugal-Empresa
Publica (EdP) to finance part (9%) of the foreign exchange cost.
1.02      The Project would form part of the planned development program
for the power sector to meet the forecast growth of demand in the period 1976-
86. This development program, which is the result of continuing study by the
power supply industry, has been presented to the Government for formal approval.
1.03      There have been five previous power loans to Portugal, totalling
US$57.5 million. These comprised Loan 362-PO (US$7.5 million; 1963) for a
210-MW hydropower project on the River Douro; Loan 363-PO (US$5 million; 1963)
for a 50-MW steam turbo-generating unit at the Tapada do Outeiro coal-fired
station; Loan 412-PO (US$15 millon; 1965) for the first (125-MVW) stage of the
Carregado oil-fired station; Loan 452-PO (US$20 million; 1966) for the 180-MW
Carrapatelo hydropower project on the River Douro; and Loan 453-PO (US$10 mil-
lion; 1966) for the second 125-M1W unit at the Carregado thermal station. The
three thermal power loans were made to Empresa Termoelectrica Portuguesa (ETP)
and the two hydropower loans to Hidro-Electrica do Douro (HED). In December
1969 both these companies were merged into Companhia Portuguesa de Electricidade
(CPE), which was nationalized under the recent nationalization law (paras 2.07
and 2.08). All the projects were successfully completed and are now in operation.
1.04      This appraisal report was prepared by B. Russell (economist),
I. Mathai (financial analyst), V. Mastilovic (engineer) and N. Green (engi-
neer). It is based on information which they obtained during a mission to
Portugal in September/October, 1975.
II. THE POWER AND ENERGY SECTOR
A. The Country and the Economy
2.01      Portugal is one of the smaller European countries in area (92,000
km2) and population (8.6 million in 1974, growing at 0.9% p.a.). Economic



growth was slow during most of the century but accelerated greatly from the
late 1950's. Real GNP and per capita income more than doubled in the period
1963-1973, growing at over 7% p.a. Nevertheless, because of its late start
in modern economic development Portugal's GNP per capita (US$1,410 in 1973)
is at the lower end of the European range, about mid-way between the figures
for Greece and Yugoslavia. Moreover, there were wide disparities between
sectors, rapid industrial growth (10% p.a.) contrasting with relative stagna-
tion in agriculture (under 1% p.a). As a result, the share of agriculture in
GDP fell from 22% in 1963 to 15% in 1973, while the share of industry rose
from 39% to 45%.
2.02      Since the 1974 revolution Government has adopted a more active poli-
cy to bring the benefits of economic growth to all sections of the population
and regions of the country. Major sectors of the economy (including electric
power supply) have been nationalized, although the important continuing role
of the private sector has been emphasized. The present Government proposes
to tackle the serious problem of unemployment through an investment program
focussed on the labor-intensive building sector, in which the proposed con-
struction program for power will play a part.
B. Power and Energy Resources
2.03      Portugal's main indigenous energy resources are hydropower, coal
and uranium ore, of which hydropower is the most important. The total hydro-
electric energy potential is estimated at about 17,500 GWh p.a.; existing
plants have a capability of about 8,290 GWh p.a. in an average year and plants
under construction will have an average output of 2,520 GWh p.a. Of the re-
maining hydro potential only about 3,500 GWh p.a. could be economically devel-
oped for electricity production. Reserves of coal are very small, comprising
only about 12 million tons of very poor quality anthracite (4,100 kcal/kg)
and about 27 million tons of lignite (1,750 kcal/kg). Practically all coal
production is used to supply a thermal power plant and the national steel
industry. The known resources of uranium, located in three main mining areas,
total 8,700 tons of uranium oxide (U308). Intensive prospecting for gas and oil
has so far been unsuccessful.
2.04      Since domestic fossil fuel resources are so small, Portugal depends
largely on imported fuels, which accounted for about 88% (oil 83% and coal 5%)
of total primary energy consumption in 1974. The nationalized Portuguese oil
refineries have an annual capacity of 9.5 million tons which will be increased
by an additional 10 million tons in 1977. Because of its high dependence on
imports, Portugal is trying to diversify its sources of energy supplies to
reduce the risk of interruptions. The possibility of increased coal imports
is being examined in order to alleviate the almost complete dependence on
imported crude oil. The proposed nuclear power development program (para.
3.05) will also contribute to diversification, as well as reducing dependence
on imports.

C. Organization of the Power Sector
Background
2.05      According to a 1944 law which established the basis for electrifi-
cation of the country:
(a) power production would be mainly hydroelectric;
(b) companies would be formed with Government help to develop
hydroelectric resources and to transmit power throughout
the country, the new generating and transmission facilities
forming the primary system;
(c) large existing utilities (with generation and distribution
facilities) forming the secondary system would meet their
additional requirements from the primary system;
(d)  small distribution utilities would purchase power from the
large utilities or from the primary system;
(e) large power-intensive industries would purchase power directly
from the primary system, aad
(f) Government would establish tariffs.
2.06      Five companies were established between 1945 and 1954 to form the
primary system, three hydro companies each with a 75-year concession to
develop a specific area, a thermal electric company and a nationwide trans-
mission company. The primary system was operated as if it were under a
single ownership. Government fixed the tariffs and determined the revenues
of the individual companies, appointed two of the five to six members of
each Board, and approved the Chairman, the chief executive officer. Govern-
ment or Government institutions were also large shareholders of the compa-
nies and Government policies strongly influenced the companies' operations
and to a large extent determined their performance. Therefore, the compa-
nies, though formally private, had a quasi-public character.
2.07      In order to remove certain shortcomings in the division of the
system amongst five companies (e.g. in system planning, cumbersome tariffs
and revenue allocation, duplication of staff and multiplicity of controls)
and in line with the Bank's long-standing recommendations during its asso-
ciation with the sector (para. 1.03), the five companies were merged by
law into one (CPE) with effect from December 1969, with a perpetual con-
cession and with Government majority interest (52', voting stock). This po-
sition continued through April 15, 1975, at which time, except for small
generating centers owned by fourteen distributing companies (5% of total),



- 4 -
which carried out distribution at high and low tension in the areas covered
by their concessions, CPE was solely responsible for generation and transmis-
sion of power, and sold electricity to the distribution companies and about
20 power-intensive industries. Some 200 municipalities also retailed power
supply mainly at low tension in residential areas.
Nationalization of the Power Sector
2.08      The large number of enterprises operating in the sector inevitably
caused overlapping of networks and a wide diversity of rates and inhibited
coordinated and economical development of the sector. In order to promote
such development, Government nationalized CPE and the fourteen distribution
companies (including the one in Azores) with effect from April 16, 1975, by
Decree Law 205-G/75 of that date (Annex 1), according to which:
(a) the existing Boards of Directors were disbanded, substi-
tuting administrative committees (usually the former
management), but salary and personnel administration
were reserved for Government;
(b) the nationalized companies would be reorganized and a new
economic-juridical entity would be established in accordance
with legislation to be published in 90 days (subsequently
extended);
(c)  all assets of the municipal power-generating and distribu-
tion enterprises and other power enterprises would be trans-
ferred to the entity;
(d) an 11-man Reorganization Commission was established in the
Ministry of Industry and Technology charged with determining
the structure of the new entity, proposing uniform personnel
policies and salary scales, reviewing problems of eventual
integration of municipal power assets and drafting legisla-
tion to implement needed measures, and
(e) compensation would be paid to stockholders of nationalized
companies according to a notification to be issued within
180 days (subsequently extended).
A list of the nationalized enterprises is given in Annex 2.
Reorganization and Establishment of New Entity
2.09      Based on the recommendations of the Reorganization Commission, Gov-
ernment proposes to enact a law establishing EdP with headquarters in Lisbon,
under a charter providing the legal framework for its operations. EdP will
actually come into existence as a legal entity and start operations with



effect from July 1, 1976. Its governing and management bodies will be as
given in Annex 3. EdP will also be governed by the general law applicable to
State-owned companies under which the company is required to charge prices
sufficient to ensure revenues to cover "operating costs and ensure suitable
level of self-financing and of return on invested capital." Where for reasons
of economic and social policy the company is required to charge lesser prices,
the State is required to provide the company with "extraordinary revenues
to offset the results of the requirement."
2.10      After its establishment, EdP will have to decide on the organization
structure deemed necessary for fulfilling its responsibilities. The present
thinking is for organizing EdP on the following general lines:
(a) integration and centralization of policies and major decisions
in Lisbon under a central management with central staff depart-
ments for planning, engineering, finance, economics, personnel,
organization, legal, etc.;
(b) decentralization of operational activities;
(c) the operating units would correspond roughly to the existing
generation and transmission enterprises, with perhaps three
regional Direction offices, each one controlling four or five
distribution enterprises (corresponding roughly to the exist-
ing enterprises), and
(d) until the above changes could be brought about (estimated
time: six months), the existing enterprises would continue
with the addition of only a central management organization
as in (a) above, the basic idea being to minimize disloca-
tion in the transitional phase.
2.11      The Reorganization Commission was originally expected to continue
even after the new entity was established to oversee the gradual absorption
of the remaining electricity enterprises and to assist Government in matters
connected with the sector such as rationalization of tariffs and standard-
ization. However the Commission is currently not expected to continue much
longer; the duties envisaged for it would probably be discharged by some
other body within Government.
2.12      In the past several Government institutions regulated, controlled
and supervised power sector development and operations. The Ministry for
Public Works approved the planning and development of all hydroelectric proj-
ects and the State Department for Electricity in the Ministry for Industry
and Technology dealt with all other matters related to the production, trans-
mission, distribution and consumption of electricity. In particular, this
Department has had control of the safety and licensing aspects of the power
sector. It also reviewed tariff proposals and submitted them to the Govern-
ment for approval. EdP will be responsible for sector development planning
but the development plans are subject to Government approval. The sector
development plan, which covers a ten-year period and is reviewed annualLy,



- 6 -
has previously had to be considered and agreed among different official
agencies such as the Ministry for Public Works, Nuclear Power Commission,
Ministry of Planning and Ministry of Finance. While the distribution of
duties among the various ministries of Government would perhaps continue as
in the past, EdP would function under the administrative control of one Min-
istry viz. the Ministry of Industry and Technology.
D. Historical Development
2.13      National power sector statistical data for the period 1964-1974
are shown in Annex 4. Total generation increased from 4,760 GWh in 1964 to
10,585 GWh in 1974 (trend growth rate 8.8% p.a.). The public utilities (CPE
and distribution companies) accounted for 4,496 GWh (94%) in 1964 and 10,065
GWh (95%) in 1974, showing a trend growth rate of 9.0% p.a. Hydro generation,
which averaged about 89% of the total public utilities' generation during the
period, declined from 93% at the beginning of the period to about 77% at the
end. Since Portugal had ample hydropower resources (para. 2.03) and practi-
cally no indigenous fuels, past emphasis was almost entirely on hydropower
development. Hydrological and geomorphological conditions are not very favor-
able for electricity production; hydropower plants are mostly run-of-river and
the storage capacities are not adequate for matching seasonal load fluctuations.
The hydro to thermal ratio has been unusually high and led to over-installation
in hydro-generating capacities in order to satisfy power demand during varying
hydrological conditions. In connection with previous loans to the power sector,
the Bank suggested more balanced development of hydro and thermal power genera-
tion, and construction of large thermal power plants has since been undertaken.
Total installed capacity rose from 1,607 MW (public utilities: 1,468 MW or
91%) in 1964 to 2,980 MIW (public utilities: 2,797 MW or 94%) in 1974. A
220-kV transmission link with Spain (capacity 270 MW) permits reserve-
sharing and emergency supply.
2.14      The trend of electricity consumption, in total and by consumer cate-
gories, is summarized below:
Consumption (GWh)                 1964        %         1974         X

Total electricity consumption increased at a trend rate of 8.4% annually.
Maximum demand, which was 814 MW in 1964, attained 1968 MW in 1974, with
an annual trend growth rate of about 9.6%. During this period the overall
plant factor increased from 34% to about 41%, which is still extremely low.
The average electricity consumption per capita in 1974 was 1,314 kWh, almost
the lowest in Europe.
2.15      The power system at present contains a large number of relatively
small generating plants (up to 100 MW), although 125-MW thermal units were
introduced in 1968 and the first 250-MW thermal unit is now under construc-
tion. Basic data and main characteristics of the thermal and hydro gen-
erating plant (existing, under construction and proposed) are given in An-
nexes 5 and 6.
2.16      The transmission network consists of overhead transmission lines and
substations operated at 60,150 and 220-kV, which interconnect the whole of the
country. The first 400-kV transmission lines and substations are presently
under construction. The operation of the generating stations and the trans-
mission facilities is fully coordinated in order to secure continuity of supply
and economy of power production. Details of the transmission network are given
in Annex 7 and the Map (IBRD 11971).
2.17      The Portuguese electric power system is presently interconnected
with the Spanish power system through a 220-kV transmission line. The
Portuguese, Spanish and French power systems coordinate their activies within
the Franco-Iberian Union for the Coordination of the Generation and Transmis-
sion of Electricity (UFIPTE). The main objective of UFIPTE is to promote
joint operation of the interconnected power systems by studying and proposing
solutions for various power system operational problems. UFIPTE is associated
with the Union for the Coordination of the Generation and Transmission of
Electricity (UCPTE). UCPTE, originally formed by seven West European countries
(Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Switzerland), coordi-
nates the operation of the joint interconnected power systems in Western Europe
including power load flows, load-frequency control, emergency and short-term
power supply assistance, and spinning-reserve sharing. Three working groups
of UCPTE are concerned with matters of general system operation, thermal power
plants and hydropower plants. They study and discuss various power system
problems under these heads in member countries and in the UCPTE interconnected
system as a whole. UCPTE is not involved in power business transactions and
contracting, which are handled bilaterally between the entities concerned, but
it plays an essential role in successful physical implementation of the con-
tracts.
2.18      The operation of the interconnected power system within UCPTE enables
participating members to improve the utilization of existing generating and
transmission facilities, reduce individual spinning reserves and install large
generating units. The total UCPTE peak demand is estimated (1975) to be over
150,000 MW. Such a large power system is able to accommodate very large gen-
erating units, which is especially important for the future development of
nuclear power in Europe. The international interconnections are also neces-



-8-
sary for efficient operation of the Portuguese power system, in view of its
hydro/thermal generation structure and the unit sizes in the Setubal thermal
power plant.
2.19      Until the 1975 nationalization, distribution of electric power was
carried out by numerous distribution undertakings (15 large and about 200
small enterprises). Some of these were involved in other activities, e.g.
CRGE Lisbon in city gas supply. From the technical and organizational stand-
point the distribution undertakings vary from region to region. The largest
and the best organized are those in Lisbon and Oporto. At present, there are
about ten different distribution voltages (from 2 to 40 kV) in use in Portugal.
E. Tariffs
2.20      The rates charged by the primary system (later CPE) to distributor
networks (95% of total energy supplied) remained almost unaltered from 1966
to 1974 and increases took place only for large consumers directly supplied
by the system. CPE's present tariffs and the average rates for its supply
through 1974 are given in Annex 8. In order to recover partially the in-
creased fuel oil costs following the worldwide oil price increases of 1973-
1974, CPE's energy rate was increased by Esc 0.07 per kWh (about 20%) in two
phases, Esc 0.035 per kWh in October 1974 and an equal amount in March 1975.
2.21      Medium and low tension rates vary widely throughout the country
(the ratio of the highest to the lowest domestic rates being as high as 3:1)
and no representative rates can therefore be given. The average sale prices
are about Esc 0.65 per kWh (USJ 2.6) for medium tension and Esc 1.20 per kWh
(USO 4.8) for low tension. The tariffs of CRGE, the nationalized enterprise
which distributes power supply in Lisbon (35% of total national consumption),
are given in Annex 9. Annex 10 gives certain statistics relating to CRGE's
supply in 1974. The average rate as of January 1976 for domestic supply in
Lisbon was about Esc 0.85 (US4 3.4). The following table gives comparative
rates for household consumption in Lisbon (CRGE) and Oporto (the second
largest city--served by the municipal undertaking):
Esc per kWh
Lisbon                             Oporto
1974         October 1975           1974          October 1975
1st Step       2.0                2.0                2.4                 2.5
2nd Step       1.3                1.3                 1.5                1.6
3rd Step       0.5                0.7                0.36                0.5
Note:  Consumption to which 1st and 2nd step rates apply depends on the number
of rooms and month of supply. For an average size dwelling, the 1st and 2nd
step rates will apply to a total consumption of about 50 kWh.



- 9 -
2.22      The Reorganization Commission (para. 2.08) and Government are al-
ready studying the question of rationalization of electricity rates in the
country through task forces set up for the purpose. Pending completion of
the studies, in tMay 1976 Government approved rate increases for all electri-
city supply enterprises. For EdP, the rate increases varied on an average
from about 18% for low voltage customers to about 27% for CPE's special in-
dustrial customers such as traction, electrochemical and electrometallurgical
customers, the overall average rate increase being about 24%.  The financial
estimates in this report assume implementation of the rate increase from June
1, 1976. Although rationalization of rates throughout the country would take
considerable time, rationalization of EdP's rates could be completed earlier.
Accordingly EdP would take all steps necessary to obtain Government's approval
of a revised structure for the sale of electricity taking into account margin-
al costs of supply, and not later than December 31, 1977, commence implementa-
tion of such a revised rate structure. Government has also agreed to take all
action necessary to enable EdP to commence implementation of such a revised
rate structure not later than December 31, 1977.
F. Load Forecast
2.23      Portuguese forecasts for the period 1976-1986 (Annex 11) show sales
increasing from 8,520 GWh in 1975 to 12,908 GWh in 1980, and 20,530 GWh in
1986, with an annual growth rate of 8.8% until 1980, and 7.9% thereafter. The
maximum demand would increase from 2,020 MW in 1975 to 3,095 1IW in 1980 and
4,905 MW in 1986. Industrial consumption remains dominant, representing 67%
of total sales in 1980 and 62% in 1986.
2.24      In making these forecasts various methods were used, as described
in Annex 22. They include regression models, using macroeconomic variables
such as aggregate industrial production, GNP and individual consumption, and
extrapolation methods, mostly used to determine future bus-bar and substation
loads. Separate forecasts are made for the larger industrial customers. Load
management and energy conservation measures apparently are not incorporated
into the forecasts and so they may be overstated somewhat. The forecasts of
energy and demand are prepared annually. Since industrial loads represent the
major portion of the forecast demand and are especially dependent on the gen-
eral economic outlook in Portugal, all projections are subject to frequent
changes. The forecasts given in Annex 11 appear to be the most realistic and
future investment plans are essentially based on them.
G. Power System Planning
2.25      EdP's Planning Department has well-qualified staff with extensive
experience in power system planning. tModern computer models are used for this
purpose. The Planning Department prepares long-term development studies (up



- 10 -
to 1995) and medium-term investment programs. Plant already under construction
is expected to meet requirements through 1981. The investment program for the
period 1982-1986 is awaiting Government's final approval in its entirety. The
medium-term investment programs are revised at least once a year. Power sys-
tem planning methods and procedures in Portugal are soundly based for the pur-
pose of determining the least cost development programs, using a reasonable
range of test discount rates (see Annex 22).
2.26      Details of forecast energy and capacity balances and of proposed
generation facilities are given in Annex 11. They show that installed capac-
ity is expected to grow from 2,776 DIW (69% hydro) in 1975 to 4,005 MW (61%
hydro) by 1980 and 6,918 MW (55% hydro) in 1986. The plant margin appears
rather low in 1981 and 1982 (around 20%) in view of the predominance of hydro
generation and the limited storage capacities in Portugal (although it should
be borne in mind that there is additional storage located upstream in Spain,
e.g. on the River Douro).
III.  THE SECTOR PROGRAM
A. General
3.01      The Bank Project is the power sector investment program for the
period 1976-1978. The purposes of the program are to provide the most eco-
nomical electricity supply to meet the forecast growth in demand and to main-
tain required reliability of the power system. The Project includes facili-
ties under construction by January 1, 1976 or to be started prior to the end
of 1978 and comprises the following:
(a) Generation
1,562 MIIW of hydroplant
1,740 of thermal plant
(b) Transmission
1,200 km of 400-kV transmission lines
950 km of 220-kV transmission lines
600 km of 150-kV transmission lines
140 km of 60-kV transmission lines
1,845 MVA of 400/220-kV substations
1,350 MIVA of 400/150-kV substations
1,215 MIVA of 220/150-kV substations
3,420 MVA of 220/60-kV substations
2,440 DIVA of 150/60-kV substations
255 DIVA of 150/30-kV substations



- 11 -
(c) Distribution
the expansion of existing distribution networks and
rural electrification
Annex 12 lists the major facilities included in the Project.
3.02      The performance of the power sector in the construction and opera-
tion of power facilities has been satisfactory. Hydroelectric power plants
(both storage and run-of-river) up to installed capacities of 300 MW have
been successfully designed and built and no problems are anticipated in exe-
cuting the hydro projects under construction and planned in the present pro-
gram. Past experience has not indicated any difficulties in designing, build-
ing and operating oil-fuelled steam power plants of the sizes envisaged in
the program (125 MW and 250 MW). EdP has no previous experience of nuclear
plant construction but will have the assistance of experienced consultants in
designing and constructing a proposed 670-MW nuclear power station which is
included in the program, and will also be able to draw on the nuclear experi-
ence of other European power companies with which it is associated. Extensive
preparations have been made to recruit and train the necessary staff for the
construction and operation of the nuclear station. Construction and operation
of transmission facilities will not present any particular problems. All
necesary investigations and design criteria for the first 400-kV transmission
lines and substations, which are presently under construction, are basically
complete. The number of engineering and technical staff (Annex 15) and their
experience also indicate that EdP is fully competent and well prepared to
carry out the proposed development program.
B. Hydroelectric Power Plants
3. 03           Seven hydroelectric power plants are under construction with
total installed capacity of 1,238 MW and average annual generation of 2,520
GWh.  At least two new hydroelectric power plants are planned to be constructed
by 1985 with total installed capacity of 705 MW and average annual generation
capability of about 250 GWh. Details of these plants are given in Annex 6.
They mostly form part of multipurpose projects for irrigation, water supply,
flood control and, in the case of Douro river, inland navigation. The con-
struction of new pump-storage schemes or the adaptation of existing hydro-
electric schemes for pumping operation is being considered but no firm plans
have been made.
C. Steam and Gas-Turbine Plants
3.04      Three steam-turbine power plants are under construction:  Carregado
thermal power plant extension with two generating units rated 125 MW each,
Setubal thermal power plant (2 x 250 MW) and Barreiro power plant (2 x 35 IW)



- 12 -
for power and industrial steam production. A power plant at Alto de Mira with
two 23.6-MW gas-turbine generating units was nearing completion in 1975. Fur-
ther expansion of the Setubal power plant is planned, and in view of the delay
of one year already experienced in the decision to proceed with the nuclear
option, it is now necessary to proceed with Setubal No. 3. The No. 4 unit
wil:L depend on the timing of the nuclear unit to be decided at the end of 1976
based on the values of tenders to to be submitted in the interim. The proposed
thermal power plant development will improve the hydro/thermal capacity balance
in !The Portuguese power system. All listed steam and gas turbine plants will
niti:Lize irported oil. Economic feasibility studies of thermal power plant
using local lignites indicated relatively high production costs (about Esc 1/
kTh') and thus there are presently no plans to build thermal plants based on
these fuels.
D. Nuclear Plant
3.05      In view of its uranium ore reserves, the scarcity of other indigenous
energy resources and the heavy dependence on imported fuels, Portugal is now
actively considering the construction of a first nuclear power plant. A group
of consultants (SWECO of Sweden and Mlotor Columbus/Electrowatt of Switzerland)
has been commissioned to prepare the design and will be responsible for techni-
cal evaluation of the proposed equipment. Architect engineers will be engaged
to assist in the overall design. The economic evaluation will be performed by
the Portuguese engineering and planning services. The plant is likely to have
an installed capacity of about 670 MIW and the least cost development program
for the power sector (para 7.05) provides for its completion in 1983. Legal
and licensing problems related to the nuclear power plant are generally re-
solved. All preparatory studies and investigations are also completed. The
final decision whether or not to start construction will be taken by the Gov-
ernment following receipt of proposals for the nuclear steam supply expected
to be received by October 1976.
3.06      Based on information collected in 1976 from major nuclear power
plant e-uipment suppliers, the estimated cost of the plant is Esc 15,100 mil-
lion (US$604 million equivalent), or Esc 22,537/kW (US$900/kW).  The financing
of the nuclear power plant would require significant external capital, which is
expected to be provided mainly in the form of suppliers' credits. Part of the
proceeds of the proposed Bank loan may be used for financing the cost of for-
eign consulting services for the nuclear power plant provided a positive de-
cision is taken to proceed with the project.
3.07      The power systen appears small to incorporate a large nuclear gen-
erating unit of the size proposed. However, the problem can be successfully
solved through the proposed 400-kV international interconnection with other
EurDpean countries via Spain, which will allow installation of this unit in
the Portuguese system. The power system operational behavior will be studied
in detail in order to identify possible operating problems and to take the
necessary measures to prevent or control them.



- 13 -
E. Transmission
3.08       The 1976-78 development program provides for the installation of
2,890 km of transmission lines and 10,525 MVA of substation capacity.  The
preliminary studies and design work have already been undertaken. The deci-
sion to choose 400-kV as the rated voltage of the network to be superimposed
on an existing 220-kV network in northern Portugal and a 150-kV network in
southern Portugal appears to be sound and fully justified; this voltage level
is extensively used in all the other countries which are part of the UCPTE
power pool, and distances and power to be transmitted in Portugal during the
next 20-25 years will require 400-kV lines. The plans for future extensions
of the 400-kV system cover the period to the year 2000. The 400-kV transmis-
sion system has been planned to a very large extent with a radial configura-
tion. In addition to the 400-kV link with Spain at Cedillo, Portugal is
planning to establish a second 220-kV interconnection with Spain in the north.
The 400/ 220-kV and 400/150-kV substations will consist of single phase auto-
transformers, each rated 150 HVA. A very high level of design unification
is proposed, which wil1 lead to reduced maintenance and replacement costs.
F. Distribution
3.09       The sector development program includes provision for the expansion
of nationalized distribution networks in Portugal. Some electrical equipment
for distribution networks has to be imported, particularly underground cables,
capacitors and protective relaying devices. The centralized purchase of dis-
tribution equipment will have a positive influence on the standardization and
unification of distribution equipment and construction practices throughout
Portugal. The specific goals of the unification, which will be a long process,
are not yet defined. Much of the work will be 'devoted to the improvement of
existing distribution systems and establishing common criteria and guidelines
for planning and operational purposes.
G. Rural Electrification
3.10       At the beginning of 1975 about 1.5 million inhabitants (20%) still
had no access to public electricity supply. In the past, electrification of
rural areas has progressed at an average rate of 90,000 inhabitants per year,
at which rate the total electrification of the country would require about 17
years to complete. There are proposals to accelerate the rate of electrifi-
cation in order to complete the process in about 8 years, but this would re-
quire a big increase in the allocation of Government funds, which are the main
source (about two thirds) of rural electrification financing. Government



- 14-
budgetary provision for the program rose from Esc 60 million in 1970 to Esc
147 million in 1974. The average specific cost in the period 1972-1974 was Esc
1,900/inhabitant (US$76 equivalent). Future costs will be much higher because
of inflation and the relative smallness and remoteness of the villages to be
electrified. Consequently, the total cost of completing the electrification
of the country is estimated at Esc 4-6 billion (US$160-240 million). To com-
plete the program within 8 years it would be necessary to invest Esc 500-700
million per year (US$20-30 million). This seems unlikely although some
increase in the rate of electrification is anticipated.
3.11      There are no reliable data on the trend of consumption in electrified
villages, but generally it is estimated to increase by 10-12% annually. Speci-
fic consumption in rural areas varies widely from 200-350 kWh annually per
consumer in the northeast to over 1,000 kWh elsewhere.
H. Cost Estimate
3.12      The estimated construction expenditures for the 3-year period 1976-
1978 are set out in Annex 12 and summarized below:

3.13      Estimates for equipment are based on early 1976 international and
local prices; estimates for civil construction works are based on the cost of
works of a similar nature that have been completed recently. Physical contin-
gencies have been estimated at about 10% on average.  Price contingencies were
calculated by compounding at annual rates of increase of 14% (1976) and 12%
(1977-1978) for local costs, and of 10% (1976) and 8% (1977-1978) for foreign
expenditures.  The foreign costs quoted represent the foreign exchange costs
of equipment, materials and services purchased by EdP from abroad.  They do not



- 15 -
include the foreign exchange component of equipment and materials purchased
locally. This is estimated to represent on average about 48% of the cost of
goods supplied by Portuguese manufacturers and 15% of civil works costs. On
this basis imports required by Portuguese suppliers of equipment and materials
would have a foreign exchange value of about US$208 million (including physical
and price contingencies); thus the total foreign exchange cost would be about
$380 million.
3.14      The capital cost estimates for hydroelectric power plants range from
US$530/kW to US$1,000/kW (median value US$660/kW); for steam power plant (oil)
the estimate is US$435/kW for 250-MW units. Costs of single-circuit trans-
mission lines range from about US$84,000/km for 400-kV lines to US$28,000/km
for 60-kV lines. The specific investment for substations is about US$16,000-
20,000/MVA. The capital cost estimates quoted are within the range of the
costs of similar power projects appraised by the Bank recently and comparative
cost data indicate that prices from Portuguese suppliers are reasonable. Pro-
jected distribution expenditures appear to be rather low in relation to invest-
ments in generation, probably because 60-kV lines are included in transmission
and some municipally owned distribution networks, which have not been national-
ized, are excluded.
1. Financing
3.15      The proposed loan of US$36 million equivalent would cover about 9%
of the foreign exchange costs of the development program for 1976-1978. Re-
maining foreign exchange costs are expected to be met from suppliers' credits
and other loans (para 5.09). The local costs would be financed by EdP out of
its own internal cash generation, local loans, Government equity and other par-
ticipation. No retroactive financing is proposed. The loan would be granted
to EdP.
J. Procurement and Disbursement
3.16      The proceeds of the proposed loan would finance part of the foreign
cost of equipment and materials required to be purchased in the period 1976-
1978. Contracts for equipment to be financed by the Bank, as determined sub-
sequently by EdP with the approval of the Bank, would be awarded through in-
ternational competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines for
Procurement. A preference of 15% or applicable duties, whichever is lesser,
would be granted to Portuguese manufacturers who participate. A list of goods
suitable for procurement in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines for Procure-
ment has been agreed (Annex 13). Disbursements would be for the c.i.f. cost of
imported items or 100% of the ex-factory cost of items supplied under contracts
won by Portuguese manufacturers under international competitive bidding, and
for the cost of related engineering services. The loan would be utilized both
to finance goods and services which cannot be supplied locally to the extent
of about US$19 million, and equipment having a high foreign cost component for
which Portuguese manufacturers are likely to compete to the extent of the
balance of the loan viz US$17 million. The expected disbursements from the
proposed loan and the allocation of loan proceeds are shown in Annex 14.

K. Engineering and Supervision
3.17      Arrangements for engineering are satisfactory.  EdP engineering staff
are actively involved in various phases of the design of generating, transmis-
sion and distribution facilities. They are responsible for many of the engine-
ering studies and of the preliminary and final designs. Local engineering
firms have broad experience in designing hydroelectric power plants. Foreign
engineering consultants are used in the preparation of designs for new large
thermal power plants (nuclear and 250-MW oil-fired units) and 400-kV transmis-
sion lines. It is expected that the borrower will continue to employ consult-
ants with satisfactory qualifications, experience and conditions of employment
for preparation of bid documents, evaluation of bids and construction supervi-
sion relating to the first nuclear power plant and also for other engineering
services and studies as necessary.
L. Environmental Concerns
3.18      The State Commission on Environment, on which all the technical
ministries are represented, is responsible for ensuring that environmental
factors are taken into account before projects, including power projects,
are approved. Existing legislation is very general and there are serious
gaps e.g. there are no clearly defined standards regarding water pollution.
The Commission is now preparing detailed legislation for the protection of
the environment. Apart from the general responsibilities of the Commission
various other state agencies have specific responsibilities for environmental
protection, e.g. the Ministry for Social Equipment and the Environment and the
Nuclear Energy Commission. Construction of hydroelectric power plants is sub-
ject to a strict licensing procedure which requires consideration of environ-
mental factors before construction is authorized. Conventional steam power
plants in Portugal use imported fuel oil for the most part and do not pose
any insurmountable environmental probLems, provided appropriate emission stand-
ards are enforced. Nuclear power plants will be subject to environmental con-
trols in accordance with international standards. Transmission expansion
will inevitably impinge on visual amenity, as in other countries, but this
can be minimized by careful planning. No specific covenant is proposed, since
existing arrangements, supplemented by the legislation in preparation, are
considered adequate to ensure appropriate attention to environmental aspects
in designs and standards.
IV. THE PROJECT ENTITY
A. Problem Areas and New Management
4.01      The Project will be implemented by EdP.  Its functions, management
bodies and organization structure are described in paras 2.09-2.11. 'It will
have to ensure efficient operations while tackling the problems caused by the



- 17 -
reorganization. It will also have to accomplish the following objectives
apart from the financial objective (para 5.12):
(a) progressive integration of municipal power assets
(para 2.08);
(b) rationalization of tariffs (para 2.22);
(c) introduction of uniform policies on wages and
salaries (para 4.05), and
(d) standardization of accounting systems and procedures
and operating rules (para 5.15).
4.02      EdP's charter states that the entity would have autonomy in respect
of management, financial matters and capital. While this would by and large
be true for day-to-day operations, many matters are reserved to Government as
the sole shareholder or because of the perceived need to ensure uniformity of
practice throughout the public sector, e.g., approval of capital and operating
budgets, of accounts and of personnel regulations, establishment of tariff
policies, etc. Areas of special concern to the Bank are:
(a) Personnel matters - Government has advised that EdP would
be free to negotiate with workers wages within certain maxi-
mum and minimum levels applicable to all enterprises in the
public sector. This should provide the necessary flexibility
for EdP to fix salary levels in keeping with changing market
conditions;
(b) Tariffs - The Bank has advised Government that the charter
should indicate that formulation of tariffs within the guide-
lines set by Government is a responsibility of EdP, and
(c) Operating Budget - To be truly autonomous in day-to-day opera-
tions, EdP should be free to determine its operating budget,
concerned as it is with day-to-day operations, without reference
to Government. Although Government has advised that despite the
provision in the charter, this would most likely be the case,
the Bank has recommended that a change in the charter would be
desirable to provide for such autonomy. The matter will continue
to engage the Bank's attention.
4.03      EdP would not have a chief executive responsible for all management
and to that extent authority for management of operations would be rather
diffused. This is deliberate and in keeping with the policy of making groups
of officials collectively responsible for management rather than concentrating
authority in one single individual. A good management team is necessary for
EdP in order to be able to cope with the numerous problems it faces and to



- 18 -
manage it under difficult conditions. Judging by the quality of the manage-
ment in CPE and CRGE it is expected that Government would have no difficulty
in providing a team of the required caliber.
B. Staff
4.04      The nationalized sector has (October, 1975) a total staff of about
12,790, about 820 of whom (6%) have university degrees. Engineers form 70%
of the university graduates. A breakdown of staff by categories is given in
Annex 15. About 8,700 of the staff (68% of total) are in three enterprises,
CPE with 4,200 (33%), CRGE excluding the gas wing with 3,400 (26%) and Uniao
Electrica Portuguesa (UEP) with 1,100 (9%).
4.05      One problem of the sector is the large variety of salary levels and
terms of service applicable to the nationalized entities and the need to unify
them progressively within two years as per present plans. The enterprises form
four distinct groups according to present salary levels. CPE and CRGE have
the highest salaries and, together with UEP and Companhia Hidroelectrica do
Norte de Portugal, form the first group with salaries well above the others.
In order to bring about uniformity in salaries, there would be a series of
salary adjustments, the first of which was applied to all enterprises in
varying degrees effective October 1975. The effect was an increase of about
25% in the total annual wage bill of the nationalized companies. Other
measures contemplated are:
(a) raise minimum salary to Esc 5,500 p.m. as against about
Esc 4,000 now;
(b) reduce the spread between minimum and maximum salaries, and
(c) fix new salary levels a little below the CPE-CRGE level for
new staff and progressively upgrade existing salaries that
are below these levels, while maintaining higher salaries
to existing incumbents.
4.06      In addition, cost of living adjustment in salaries is made every
six months or so but total indexing in this respect is forbidden by Govern-
ment. Collective bargaining agreements valid for two to three years make for
industrial peace in the sector. No further salary adjustments are expected
in 1976.
V. FINANCE
A. Highlights of Financial Position
5.01      The highlights of EdP's financial position are as follows:



- 19 -
(a) An average tariff increase of 24% has been approved by Govern-
ment in May 1976 for immediate implementation (para. 2.22);
(b) Government has been considering a scheme of compensation to
stockholders of the nationalized companies; compensation for
the hydroelectric facilities acquired from a Spanish company
following revocation of its license has also to be settled.
Both these issues are expected to be satisfactorily settled
in the near future (paras. 5.02-5.05);
(c) the constituent units of EdP had no clear, long-range finan-
cial objectives; an appropriate financial objective now to be
set for EdP would be to achieve a self-financing level, after
debt service and dividend payments, of at least 30% from 1979
onwards. Before December 31, 1976 financial objectives satis-
factory to the Bank would be established for EdP for 1977 and
thereafter (para. 5.12);
(d) EdP's financing plan for the Project is not firm since: (i)
arrangements have yet to be made for direct foreign exchange
requirements amounting to US$72 million out of a total of
US$172 million (15% of program), i.e., excluding the pro-
posed Bank loan of US$36 million (3%), a European Investment
Bank (EIB) loan of about US$40 million (4%) and suppliers'
credits of US$24 million (2%); and (ii) except for a US$70
million equivalent loan from two Portuguese national banks
for which negotiations are about to be concluded, local loans
of US$493 million equivalent (44%) are also not assured (para.
5.09), and
(e) the nationalized companies follow different systems and proce-
dures (accounting including depreciation accounting, budgetary
and reporting systems, audit, insurance); application of uniform
systems and procedures for effective management is a high priority
(paras. 5.13, 5.15, 5.16 and 5.17).
B. Compensation to Stockholders
5.02      The details of the. compensation scheme for stockholders of the na-
tionalized companies (para 2.08) have yet to be decided. Government recog-
nizes the importance of fair compensation in improving the investment climate
in the country so necessary at present for attracting foreign capital and is
especially mindful of the interests of small stockholders. Compensation is
not the concern of EdP but of Government which assumed the obligations of the
nationalized companies in the nationalization decree. The recommendations of
the Ministry of Finance for compensation based on the following principles
emerging from various studies have been proposed to the Council of Ministers:



- 20 -
the amount of compensation will relate to the net assets
of the company with eventual consideration of a weighted
average of the market prices of the shares over the last
years;
treasury bonds will be used for the payment of compensation.
The conditions for the repatriation of the proceeds of bond
sales out of the country are under consideration;
-    small and medium stockholders will receive bonds with more
favorable interest and amortization schedules than large
stockholders;
-    participation of the stockholders' representative in the
evaluation of the assets is under consideration, and
-    the financial cost of compensation will be assumed directly
by the State or by a public institution to be established.
After decision by the Council of Ministers, the matter would have to go to the
newly established legislature since the new Portuguese Constitution reserves
to the legislature the right to determine compensation for expropriated pro-
perties. Legislative action is not anticipated before late summer of 1976.
5.03      Although the bulk of ownership is Portuguese, some Belgian holdings
are involved in CRGE and Spanish interests in UEP (about 9% of total common
stock and reserves of all the nationalized companies) as given below:
(Amount in US$ Equivalent Millions)
Stockholders Equity         Percentage        Value of Common Stock
Common Stock                      of           Held by Foreigners in
Company    (Issue Price)  Reserves   Foreign Holdings   Terms of Issue Price
CRGC-            31.9         24.9       20% Belgian                   6.4
UEP              20.0          5.3        48% Spanish                  9.6
Total              16.0
In addition to the amount of US$16 million, the foreign stockholders would be
likely to have a claim to a substantial part of the reserves, the exact amount
of claim being dependent on the structure of the reserves. Assuming a 50%
interest in the reserves, the total foreign holdings would amount to about
USS20 million. This figure is given only to indicate the order of magnitude
of the possibie amount of compensation to the foreign stockholders and not as
ref-Lecting in any way the appropriate amount of their claim.



- 21 -
5.04      In addition to the foreign stockholders of the nationalized compa-
nies, Government has to compensate a Spanish company for the acquisition of
its properties in the Lindoso Hydro Scheme operated by it under a charter
that was revoked in the nationalization decree of April 1975. Negotiations
are under way between Government and the company for determining the amount
of compensation and the manner of its payment, which could be either in
cash or in bonds. The amount of compensation involved would perhaps be in
the neighborhood of US$10 million equivalent, a figure given only to indicate
the order of magnitude without reflecting in any way the negotiating positions
of Government or the company.
5.05      It is expected that the issue of compensation to foreign stock-
holders of the nationalized companies and to the Spanish company for the acqui-
sition of its properties in the Lindoso Ilydro Scheme would be satisfactorily
settled in the near future; therefore no covenants in this respect are con-
sidered necessary.
C. Past Performance and Present Position
5.06      The Bank's agreements (1966 and earlier) with the two borrowers, ETP
and HED, since merged into CPE (para 2.07), required a self-financing level of
10% after depreciation, taxes, debt service and payment of dividends.  After
the formation of CPE, this covenant was to have been renegotiated but the mat-
ter was not actively pursued since all five loans were fully disbursed and fi-
nancial performance was satisfactory. Even applied to CPE as a whole, the
covenant was met through 1974. Because CPE's tariffs for distributing companies
remained unaltered from 1966 through 1974 (para 2.20), the self-financing level
of the combined enterprises now forming EdP decreased from 28% in 1973 to 11%
in 1974; there would be no cash generation to finance construction either in
1975 or 1976. In terms of the rate of return on average net fixed assets in
service, the return dropped from around 8% in 1973 to under 6% in 1974 and
slightly above 1% in 1975. The lower level of performance in 1974 is partly
explained by substantial salary adjustments in 1974 (about 33% increase in
wage bill). The poor performance in 1975 was due to: the absence of any load
growth because of general recession and the unsettled conditions in the coun-
try; a dry year necessitating increased thermal generation and a fourfold in-
crease in the cost of power imports from outside the country, and a 25% aver-
age salary increase in October 1975. In 1976, although sales are expected
to rise about 6%, hydrological conditions are worse than in 1975 necessitating
greater thermal generation and imports of nearly 13% of total energy require-
ments. The full impact of the 25% salary increase is also felt in this year.
As a result, despite an average rate increase of about 24% from June 1976
gross income would fall short of operating expenses before interest by 16%,
i.e., about Esc 1170 million. EdP's income statements for 1973-1976 and
balance sheets as of December 31, 1973-1976 are given in Annexes 16 and 17.

D. Financing Plan
5.07      The following table is a summary of the sources and applications of
funds of EdP for 1976-1978, the Project period, assuming the internal cash
generation mentioned in para. 5.12 and escalation of the Project costs (para.
3.13). Annex 18 gives the sources and applications of funds for 1976-1979.

- 23 -
5.08      For the years 1977 and 1978 taken individually, EdP's net internal
cash generation after debt service and dividend payments to Government is
estimated to be slightly above 20% of average construction requirements.
However because of the substantial shortfall in earnings in 1976 (para 5.06),
the overall net cash generation for 1976-1978 is estimated to be only 1% of
construction requirements.
5.09      The proposed IBRD loan is assumed to be for US$36 million at 8.85%
for a term of 15 years including a 3-year grace period and will meet about 3%
of the total construction requirements. The remaining foreign exchange costs
are expected to be financed from a EIB loan of about US$40 million equivalent
(4% of prograrm)--35 million Units of Account--granted in April 1976 for the
Setubal 3 power station and 400-kV transmission network, suppliers' credits of
which US$24 million equivalent has been secured, and other loans for which
firm arrangements have yet to be made. Possible sources include a proposed
medium term loan through London banks and suppliers' credits to be negotiated
in connection with the proposed nuclear plant. As regards local loans, arrange-
ments have yet to be made for loans of US$493 million out of a total of US$605
million equivalent, i.e. for 44% of Project costs. Negotiations are however
about to be concluded for a USS70 million equivalent loan from two Portuguese
national banks, which would still leave a 70% gap in local financing. Hence,
the financing plan is subject to uncertainty. However, this very uncertainty
is part of the justification for the Bank loan because it is hoped that it
will have a catalytic effect in attracting foreign capital and thus help
establish a satisfactory investment climate. Government has agreed that in
the event of EdP's inability to raise finances for the Project, Government
would provide funds to insure its implementation.
E. Future Performance
5.10      Assuming that EdP will achieve an internal cash generation of 20% of
construction requirements in 1977 and 1978 and 30% in 1979 (para. 5.12), income
statements and balance sheets for the years 1976-1979 have been prepared and
are given in Annexes 16 and 17. The assumptions underlying the financial
statements are given in Annex 19. Yearly internal cash generation ratios are
given in Annex 20.
5.11      Assuming the above internal cash generation levels, the financial
condition of EdP would remain satisfactory through 1979. During this period,
there would be a preponderance of debt over equity as reflected in the debt-
equity ratio which would range from 64/36 in 1976 to 57/43 in 1978. The
current ratio would range between 1.0 to 1.2, which reflects a tight working
capital position.



- 24 -
F. Proposed Financial Covenant
5.12      Since a requirement to finance internally a percentage of the capital
expansion program is already familiar to CPE, the dominant enterprise in EdP,
such a financial covenant would be appropriate for governing EdP's operations
in future. In order to strengthen the financial independence of the sector
and to reduce its dependence on scarce Government resources which could be
better used for social priorities that do not have independent financial means,
EdP should generate enough revenues to achieve a self-financing level of at
least 30%.  Considering EdP's capitalization, its construction requirements
and the fact that the self-financing ratio would be computed after payment of
dividends to the Government on its equity contribution, the 30% level is a
reasonable objective. While accepting that achievement of self-financing of
at :Least 30% of the average cost of its construction program for the current
and preceding years would be a satisfactory objective for EdP for 1979 and
thereafter, Government considers that since the existing loan agreements with
the two borrowers, ETP and HED, since merged into CPE, require a self-financing
level of only 10%, a phased approach would be necessary to reach the 30% level.
Government would therefore establish EdP's objectives for 1977 and 1978 with a
view to causing it to progressively achieve at least the 30% level of self-
financing from 1979 onwards. Government is however not in a position at
present to give a firm undertaking outlining specific performance targets for
EdP for various years in view of the following:
(a) Studies are under way regarding objectives for the power
sector and it would be prudent to set firm objectives
only after conclusion of these studies, and
(b) the new Government, which will be in position in July
1976 after the Presidential elections, could more appro-
priately take vital decisions setting long-term objectives
for the sector.
In Line with the above approach, Government would establish in consultation
with EdP before December 31, 1976, financial objectives for EdP, satisfactory
to the Bank, for 1977 and thereafter. This report assumes a self-financing
level of about 20% in 1977-1978 and 30% in 1979.
5.13      Depreciation practices of the nationalized companies conformed to
the law on the subject and the provisions of their concessions (typical rates:
equipment, 3% under sinking fund method; industrial buildings, 2% under
straight-line method; dams, 1.66% under straight-line method). Beginning
with January 1, 1977 and in accordance with the relevant laws, EdP would adopt
for all its assets depreciation methods and rates satisfactory to the Bank.
G. Debt Limitation Covenant
5.14      The Bank's agreements (1966 and earlier) with the two borrowers, ETP
and HED, since merged into CPE (para. 2.07), required that the borrower would



- 25 -
not incur any long-term debt without the Bank's approval if the borrower's
long-term debt including the debt to be incurred exceeded twice its paid-in
capital and surplus. Under the proposed loan, the need to obtain the Bank's
approval for incurring a long-term debt would arise if EdP's long-term debt
including the debt to be incurred exceeded 1.5 times the equity capital pro-
vided by Government and its surplus. Thus the Bank would become aware of the
assumption of debt burdens by EdP earlier than would be the case under the
earlier agreements with a 2:1 debt-equity ratio. This covenant together with
the financial covenant requiring achievement of appropriate internal cash
generation (para. 5.12) would keep EdP's assumption of long-term debt under
review and ensure adequate cash flow for EdP vis-a-vis its debt service and
construction requirements.
,i.  Accounting .4d,Reporting Systems
5.15      The various constituent units of EdP have followed different systems
and procedures in the finance and accounting area (accounting, budgetary system,
reporting system and so on). Since diverse systems inhibit effective manage-
ment, unification of these systems is a matter of priority. EdP would develop
and implement by January 1, 1978 uniform financial and accounting systems and
procedures and keep the Bank adequately informed about the implementation.
I. Audit
5.16      There has been no uniform practice among the nationalized companies
in the matter of audit of their annual accounts. CPE's statute required ac-
counts for each fiscal year to be ready by March 31 of the next year; but
there was no obligation to present audited accounts to the annual general
assembly of stockholders. However, CPE has been having its accounts audited
by independent auditors (an international firm of chartered accountants based
in the UK) by March of each year. EdP would have its annual accounts audited
by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank and submit such audited
accounts to the Bank within four months after the close of each fiscal year.
J. Insurance
5.17      Insurance practices differ widely from enterprise to enterprise.
Even in CPE, the five constituent units which were merged in 1969 to form the
company still continue their old practices. Thus in one hydroelectric unit,
only self-insurance is provided, while in the other two fire and machinery
breakdown are covered by external insurance. In the thermal electric unit,
more comprehensive covers are provided through external insurance (fire, ex-
plosion, machinery breakdown, injuries to third parties, accidents to person-
nel, etc.), while in the transmission unit external insurance covers risks of
fire and accidents to personnel. The total insurance expenses of CPE in 1974



- 26 -
were about Esc 25 million (about 1.7% of operating expenses). Government is
currently reviewing the insurance practices in the nationalized sectors with
a view to developing common policies. EdP would formulate and apply by July
1, 1977 to all its operational units a uniform insurance policy for each
type of risk consistent with sound public utility practices.
VI. MIONITORING SYSTEM
6.01      Since the nationalized companies will be starting operations as a
single unified entity only from July 1, 1976, it has not been possible to
develop key indicators for monitoring EdP's performance. However, some com-
panies have been using such indicators in the past for management purposes.
By December 31, 1977 EdP would assemble in consultation with the Bank a com-
prehensive set of key indicators to monitor its technical and financial
performance in the future. Suggested key indicators are given in Annex 21.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Mfarket Growth
7.01      The proposed Project comprises the 1976-1978 part of the development
program to meet the growth of demand in the interconnected power system during
the period 1976-1986. The trend growth rate of consumption since 1964 has been
8.4% p.a. and of system maximum demand 9.6% p.a. (para. 2.14). Various projec-
tions of the future trend have been made using different methods, as described
in Annex 22. The forecast adopted for system planning purposes implies a
growth rate for sales of 6.5% in 1976, and a trend growth rate over the whole
period 1976-86 of 8.2% p.a., which is considered realistic. To allow for the
possibility that economic recovery might be delayed, an alternative forecast
was also made assuming that all the figures in the main forecast are lagged
one year.
B. Alternative Development Strategies
7.02      Generating capacity existing or under construction will suffice to
meet the forecast requirements on the main projection through 1981. Addi-
tional generating capacity, plus the associated transmission and distribu-
tion equipment, will have to be installed to meet the continued growth of
demand after 1981. In view of the high degree of dependence on imported oil
(para. 2.04), Government policy favors the exploitation of indigenous energy
resources (hydro, uranium and, to a more limited degree, coal) for meeting
future power requirements, but the alternatives of gas-turbines and oil-fired
generating stations were also considered.



- 27 -
7.03      About 60% of the hydropower potential has already been developed or
is under development but studies have been carried out of a number of further
hydro schemes which would be implemented during this period. These include
two multi-purpose schemes with hydropower components. The first, at Crestuma,
is designed to improve navigation on the River Douro; the second, at Alqueva,
is primarily for irrigation. In both cases, the Government has accepted the
principle that the share of the total capital cost allocated to the power sta-
tion component of the scheme should not exceed the cost of meeting the same
electricity requirement with alternative thermal plant. Further hydropower
projects envisage the installation of second generating units at three exist-
ing stations (Vilarinho das Furnas, Salamonde and a third to be identified),
essentially as peak-service units. These would have higher capital costs than
the alternative of gas-turbines but show a net economic advantage because of
the high cost of gas-turbine fuel. The possibilities of further expansion,
or pumped storage schemes, at existing hydro sites after 1980 are also being
studied.
7.04      The unexploited lignite deposits (para. 2.03) would provide suffi-
cient fuel for a 125-MW station, but a feasibility study indicated that the
generating cost would be about 50% more expensive than oil-fired generation.
Other studies have likewise led to the conclusion that there would be no cost
advantage in importing coal for electricity generation at the present and
projected relative prices of coal and oil. The effective choice, therefore,
for the additional thermal plants (1,340 MW) required in the period 1980-1986
lies between oil-fired and nuclear-fuelled plant.
C. Comparison of Alternatives
7.05      On the main load forecast additional thermal capacity would be
needed by 1982 to meet the growth of demand. Since a nuclear power station
could not be installed in time, this will require installation of a third
250-MW unit at the Setubal site in addition to the two units already under
construction there. For subsequent increments of capacity, the choice would
be between oil and nuclear. The costs of these alternatives were compared
as described in Annex 22, the main variables being capital costs, fuel costs
and load growth. The nuclear program was found to have the lowest present
value of costs up to a discount rate of about 13.8%. Since the opportunity
cost of capital is believed to be around 10%, this indicates that the
nuclear program is the least-cost means of meeting requirements on the
main assumptions used for the comparison. Sensitivity tests indicated that
on the lower load forecast the discount rate fell below 10% (to 9.6%).
This suggests that it might be desirable to look again at the timing of the
introduction of the first nuclear power station if the trend of the economy
before the final order is placed gives reason to believe that electricity
demand is more likely to grow in accordance with the lower forecast.



- 28 -
D. Return on Investment
7.06      Since it forms only an incomplete part of a large development pro-
gram, it is not possible to calculate the economic rate of return on the Proj-
ect considered in isolation from the progran. Instead, the return on the whole
proposed development program for the period 1976-1986 was estimated by comparing
the benefits with the costs. The costs are the attributable financial costs
(for generation, transmission and distribution), adjusted for taxes, internal
transfers and shadow pricing of unskilled labor.  The benefits comprise the
revenues from incremental power sales attributable to the program (at the
tariffs expected to be effective from June 1, 1976) plus cost savings through
substitution of generation from program plants (hydro or nuclear) with low
running costs for generation from existing thermal plants with high running
costs. The estimated rate of return is at least 4.1% (see Annex 22). This
relatively low figure reflects in part the large investment program proposed
by E.dP, partly to make up for recent under-investment in the power sector, and
the abnormally high recent inflation in power plant costs.  It also reflects
the fact that electricity rates have been deliberately held down by the Gov-
ernment as part of its anti-inflationary policy. Assuming the rate increases
usecl in the financial projections (para 5.10), which it is not thought would
significantly affect demand, the rate of return would be about 8.3%. Sensi-
tivity tests showed that the rate would be about one percentage point lower
if foreign exchange is valued 20% higher, or if capital costs are 20% higher.
7.07      While the above rate of return calculation is of little significance
as a measure of the economic worth of the program, it does indicate that, on
average, the prices charged for electricity are less than incremental costs.
To the extent that there is any demand elasticity, such a pricing policy might
tenc[ to encourage wasteful consumption of electricity and over-investment in
the sector.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECO0DIENDATIONS
8.01      Government will:
(a) take all action necessary to enable EdP to (i) commence
implementation of a revised rate structure taking into
account marginal costs of supply not later than December
31, 1977 and (ii) to obtain the revenues necessary to
achieve the agreed financial objectives (paras. 2.22 and
5.12);
(b) provide funds for implementation of the Project in 1976-
1978 in the event of EdP's inability to raise adequate
finances (para. 5.09), and



- 29 -
(c) establish in consultation with EdP before December 31, 1976
financial objectives for EdP satisfactory to the Bank (para.
5.12).
8.02      EdP will:.
(a) take all steps necessary to obtain Government's approval
of a revised rate structure for the sale of electricity
taking into account marginal costs of supply and not later
than December 31, 1977, commence implementation of such
revised rate structure (para. 2.22);
(b) take all steps including adjustments of the level and struc-
ture of its electricity rates necessary to generate a sur-
plus sufficient to finance a reasonable proportion of its
average cost of investment in power facilities in the current
and preceding years (para. 5.12);
(c) beginning with January 1, 1977, adopt for all its assets
depreciation methods and rates satisfactory to the Bank
(para. 5.13);
(d) enter into a debt limitation covenant (para. 5.14);
(e) develop, and implement by January 1, 1978, uniform financial
and accounting systems and procedures and keep the Bank ade-
quately informed about the implementation of such systems
(para. 5.15);
(f) have its annual accounts audited by independent auditors
satisfactory to the Bank and submit such audited accounts
to the Bank within four months after the close of each fis-
cal year (para. 5.16);
(g) apply by July 1, 1977 to all its operational units a uniform
insurance policy for each type of risk (para. 5.17), and
(h) assemble in consultation with the Bank a comprehensive set
of key indicators of performance (para. 6.01).
8.03      Subject to the foregoing, a Bank loan of US$36 million equivalent to
EdP is recommended for a term of 15 years including three years of grace. The
loan could be effective within three months of signing of the Loan Agreement.

global electrification, is not compatible with a basic infrastructure whose
correct functioning is essential to the economical progress of the country and
to the well-being of its population;
Considering that the extremely high investments in the sector,
which will be an increasing proportion of the total investment resources,
justify control by the State with a view to ensuring their maximum productivity,
taking into account their repercussions on other sectors of the national economy;

The 3rd step-rate includes always all the consumption that exceeds the one
established for the 1st and 2nd step-rates.
The values of the two first Step-Rates are completely independent of the meter.



ANNEX 9
Page 3 of 8
1st Step-Rate
is determined by the number of rooms and changes with the seasons of the
year: a higher value for the Winter months; a medium value
for Spring and Autumn, and a lower one for Summer months.
2nd Step-Rate
depends only on the number of rooms, its value being the same as the lowest
one of the 1st step-rate.
These two step-rates correspond to the presumable consumption of the electrical
equipment of low consumption.
3rd Step-Rate
applies to all the consumption beyond the values established for the 1st and
2nd step-rates.
It allows economical use of all the electrical equipment even with high
consumption, because of its low cost.

Assumptions Underlying Financial Statements
A. Income Statements
General
Although the various nationalized companies operated as separate
enterprises through 1975 and a single national power company (EdP) would
be established only on July 1, 1976, consolidated income statements have
been prepared from 1973 assuming they operated as a single entity. Inter-
enterprise transactions have been eliminated in these income statements.
Income statements reflect only revenues and expenses related to
electricity supply and exclude CRGE's revenues and expenses related to gas
supply in Lisbon.

Percentage increases
over previous years   8.7   10.7   (0.4)   6.5    9.9    9.4    8.9
Tariffs
The report assumes implementation of average rate increases of
24% effective June 1, 1976, 25% effective January 1, 1977 and 15% each
effective January 1, 1978 and January 1, 1979.
Other Revenues
Other revenues reflect revenues from activities related to elec-
tricity supply other than from direct sale of electricity such as hire of
meters, services rendered to consumers, etc.

Fuel Costs
Fuel costs from November 1975 are based on prices ruling since
that date which are as follows:
Esc
Fuel Oil                       1,300 per ton
Coal                              789 per ton
Diesel Oil                      3,500 per kilo liter
Wages and Salaries
The report reflects an average salary increase of about 25% to
staff of all constituent units of EdP from October 1975.
Depreciation
The income statement for 1976 reflects the depreciation charges
computed by the constituent units of EdP in accordance with the law on the
subject and the provisions of their concessions. The charges represent an
average rate of about 2.8% for EdP as a whole. Depreciation has been computed
at an average rate of about 2.9% for 1977-78 and about 3.0% for 1979.
Dividends
Dividends are assumed at about 6% of the total equity capital
provided by Government.
B. Balance Sheets
General
Although the various nationalized companies operated as separate
enterprises through 1975 and a single national power company (EdP) would be
established only on July 1, 1976, consolidated balance sheets have been
prepared from 1973 assuming they operated as a single entity. Assets and
liabilities representing inter-enterprise transactions have been eliminated
in these balance sheets.
The balance sheets assume escalation of construction expenditures
in 1976-79 calculated by compounding at annual rates of increase of 14%
(1976) and 12% (1977-79) for local costs, and of 10% (1976) and 8% (1977-79)
for foreign expenditures.

Long-Term Debt
Loans from the Thermal Support Fund, a fund set up to provide
financial help to meet increased thermal generation costs in dry years, are
interest-free. The IBRD loan is assumed to be for 15 years with 3 years of
grace at 8.85% rate of interest. The EIB loan of US$40 million equivalent
is for 15 years at 6.5% rate of interest. For other new long-term debt,
both local and foreign, an average rate of interest of 10.25% p.a. has been
assumed.
During 1976, amortization has been computed in accordance with
repayment schedules of existing debt. For 1977-79 amortization has been
computed for loans other than the IBRD and EIB loans at an average rate of
6.5% after allowing for grace periods.

APPRAISAL OF SIXTH POWER PROJECT
PORTUGAL
Justification of Project
Load Forecast
1.        The 1976-78 program is designed to meet the continued growth of
demand on the interconnected power system in Portugal. The trend growth
rate of sales since 1964 has been 8.4% p.a. and of system maximum demand 9.6%
p.a. For forecasting purposes, the supply industry has used the following
methods:
(a) Analogy with the past trend in other European countries (members
of the UN Economic Commission for Europe). This forecasting
model makes use of a disaggregation of electricity consumption
by sectors -- urban, industrial, agricultural and transportation
-- and is based on a statistical analysis of the trend of per
capita consumption in each of these sectors from the year when the
other countries reached the 1970 level of consumption in Portugal.
From this analysis, three projections were derived, representing
high, low and median forecasts of per capita consumption by sector
for Portugal. Depending on the future growth rate of population
assumed, electricity consumption over the forecast period can then
be derived.
(b) Regression models, of which two have been used. The first is
based on the functional relationship between electricity consump-
tion and gross domestic product over time; the second adopts a
sectoral approach, analyzing the past relationship between the
growth of the gross product of the industrial sector and electricity
consumption, and between household expenditures and urban electri-
city consumption, as a basis for sectoral projections of electricity
demand, which are then aggregated to obtain total forecast consumption.
Both methods, which yielded similar results for the period to 1980
for which they were used, imply somewhat higher growth rates than
the "analogy" method.
(c) Aggregation of independent projections for each substation in the
interconnected system, based on extrapolation of past trends plus
information concerning major new loads. This method, which was
also applied only for the period up to 1980, resulted in forecast
figures falling between the "high" and "median" projections resulting
from the "analogy" method.



ANNEX 22
Page 2 of 8
2.        For system planning purposes, the forecast based on the "analogy"
method was adopted as the basic projection (Forecast A). It assumes that,
after the stagnation of electricity demand in 1975 on account of the economic
recession, economic recovery will set in this year and with it resumption of
more normal electricity growth. The forecast implies a growth rate of 6.5%
in 1976, and a trend growth rate over the whole period 1976-1986 of 8.2% p.a.,
somewhat below that for the period 1964-1974. The detailed figures are shown
in Annex 11. To allow for the possibility that economic recovery might not
begin until a year later i.e. in 1977. an alternative forecast (Forecast B)
was also made, identical with Forecast A except that all the figures are lagged
one year.
Power System Planning
3.        EpD's Planning Department has qualified staff and extensive experience
in power system planning. Several papers related to the current Portuguese
power planning methods and procedures have been presented to the World Energy
Conference, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe and UNIPEDE (the
International Union of Producers and Distributors of Electricity). Two
computer centers are used for power system planning purposes. EpD's Planning
Department prepares long-term development programs up to 1995 anL medium-term
investment programs. Plant already under construction is expected to meet
requirements through 1979. The investment program for the period 1980-86
has been submitted to the Government for final approval. The investment
programs are revised at least once a year.
4.        The development of the power system is simulated by a specially
developed computer model known as "Valor Agua" (Value of Water). The
simulation method allows sufficiently accurate representation of the probable
generation of the hydroelectric power plants and different types of thermal
power plants in the system. This model can simulate a power system having
28 hydroelectric plants (21 generating and 7 pumped storage), 8 thermal
power plants and a transmission network with 21 nodes, which is adequate
for Portuguese power system planning. The objective of the model is to
minimize the mathematical expectation in present worth terms of future power
system costs. An important aspect of the model is the ability to determine
the optimal means of meeting requirements in critical periods, with particular
reference to the minimum water reserves in storages required to cover the
load diagram. The model also makes it possible to determine the position
and role of each hydro and thermal power plant in the load diagram and to
check whether the allocation of the water reserves in the various storages
is appropriate for the expected power system requirements. Further,with
this model it is possible to compare the many feasible generation expansion
configurations and to determine the stream of investments which minimizes
the system capital and operating costs, subject to specified security of
supply constraints and probable river flow regimes.
5.        Generally, it may be concluded that the power system planning
methods and procedures in Portugal provide a sound basis for determining
the least cost development program for the sector, using a reasonable range
of discount rates (8-12%).

Alternative Development Strategies
6.        Generating capacity existing or under construction will suffice
to meet the forecast requirements on the main projection through 1981.
Total installed capacity at that time will amount to 4,197 MW, comprising
2,645 MW hydro and 1,552 MW thermal. Firm hydro capacity, assuming 85%
availability (as confirmed by past experience) will be 2,248 MW, and firm
thermal capacity, assuming 80% availability, 1,242 MW. System firm capacity,
therefore, will be 3,490 MW, compared with forecast peak demand in 1981 of
3,349 MW (Forecast A). The corresponding hydro generation capability is
9,970 GWh, assuming an average hydrological year, or 6,600 GWh in the critical
dry year. For the thermal plant, the corresponding figure is 10,246 GWh.
This gives a total firm system capability of 20,216 GWh, sufficient to
cover the forecast requirement of 16,480 GWh.
7.        Between 1981 and 1986, the additional generation requirement
(Forecast A) is 7,690 GWh and the corresponding increase in peak demand
1,556 MW. Further generating capacity will have to be installed to meet
these extra requirements. The feasibile technical options for this purpose
cover hydro plants, gas-turbines, conventional steam plants (coal or oil)
and nuclear plants.
8.        About 60% of Portugal's hydropower potential has already been
developed, and most of the remaining sites are doubtfully economic. How-
ever, two multipurpose developments have hydropower components. The
tirst, at Crestuma, is designed to improve navigation on the River Douro
in addition to generating electricity. The second, at Alqueva, is the
cornerstone of the irrigation program for the Alentejo area. The decisions
to undertake these projects have been made by the Government rather than a
the electricity supply industry, but they are acceptable to the latter since
it has been agreed that the share of the total cost allocated to electricity
will be based on the cost (in present worth terms) of meeting the same re-
quirement with alternative thermal plant.
9.        In addition to these two multipurpose schemes, installation of
second units at two existing hydro stations on the Cavado system (Vilarinho
das Furnas and Salamonde) is proposed, with a combined capacity of 410 MW,
plus a further 295 MW at another existing site still to be determined. These
would be essentially peak-service units. The alternative would be gas-turbines.
The capital cost for a recent gas-turbine project is 3,540 Esc/kW and the
estimate for the Cavado plants is 7,560 Esc/kW (both figures including interest
during construction). The corresponding annual capital charges at 10% interest,
assuming 20-year life for gas-turbine and 50 years for hydro equipment, are
415 Esc/kW and 756 Esc/kW respectively. The respective fixed operating costs
are 90 Esc/kW for gas-turbines and 50 Esc/kW for hydro plus, in the hydro
case, an extra 50 Esc/kW for extra transmission lines. The current cost of



ANNEX 22
Page 4 of 8
gas oil for gas-turbines is 3,400 Esc/ton (US$136). Assuming 1,000 hours'
operation of each alternative, the resulting costs per kWh generated are
1.575 Esc/kWh for the gas-turbine and 0.856 Esc/kWh for the hydro. For the
gas-turbine alternative to be competitive with the hydro plant, the cost
of gas oil would have fall to about 1,300 Esc/ton (US$52) i.e. to 38% of the
present level, which is highly unlikely. The hydro alternative is therefore
preferred.
10.     The additional hydro plants have a combined capacity of 1,131 MW
and an average annual energy capability of 1,090 GWh. Additional thermal plant
is required, therefore, to meet the forecast system requirement. The choice
lies between conventional steam plant (coal or oil-fired) and nuclear plant.
11.       The only available indigenous coal for additional thermal plant
is the lignite deposit at Rio Maior. The estimated reserves of 27 million
tons (average calorific value 1,750 kcal/kg) could supply a 125-MW unit.
A feasibility study indicated a total investment cost of 3,660 million Esc
(2,580 million Esc for the power station and 1,080 million Esc for the mine).
The estimated pithead cost of the lignite was 231 Esc/ton, equivalent to
139 Esc/million kcal. Assuming the plant operated on base load, the resulting
estimated production cost was 0.95 Esc/kWh, or more than 50% above the
cost of 0.62 Esc/kWh from alternative oil-fired plant, assuming the present
fuel-oil cost of 2,000 Esc/ton. This lignite-fired plant is not, therefore,
an economic proposition at present, although it can always be reconsidered
at a later date if there is a sufficiently large change in oil costs relative
to lignite costs.
12.       The other fossil-fuel alternative to oil would be imported coal,
which would have the advantage of diversifying the sources of fuel imports
and so reducing Portugal's dependence on imported oil. A consultants' study
carried out in 1574 indicated that to be competitive with the current fuel-
oil cost of 2,000 Esc/ton, imported coal would have to cost no more than
1,330 Esciton. 1/ This compared with recent prices paid for coal from Poland
and the USA of 1,400-1,500 Esc/ton. 1/ The future course of coal prices is,
of course, uncertain but the indications are that they will closely follow
the price of oil, which now appears to constitute the cost standard for
primary fuels on the world market. In view of the higher capital costs of a
coal station (at least 10% above the costs of a comparable oil-fired station),
economic considerations argue against the coal-fired alternative.
1/ Assuming coal with an average calorific value of 7,000 kcal/kg.



ANNEX 22
Page 5 of 8
Comparison of Alternatives
A. Assumptions
13.       The effective choice, therefore, for the additional thermal plant
required to meet the growth of demand in the period under review lies
between oil-fired and nuclear-fuelled plant. In comparing these two alter-
natives, the following assumptions were used:
(a) Load Growth
14.       For the basic case Forecast A was adopted.  This would require
the non-optional installation of a third 250-MW oil-fired unit at the Setubal
site for 1982 operation, in addition to the two similar units already under
construction', since a nuclear unit could not be installed in time. Additional
capacity would then be required by 1983 when the choice would be between
oil and nuclear.
15.       On the lower load forecast (Forecast B) the same generation plant
structure is assumed as in Forecast A.
(b) Technical Assumptions
16.       Annual availability factors assumed for hydro and oil-fired plant,
based on past experience, were 85% and 80% respectively (60% for an oil-fired
plant in its first year of operation). For nuclear plants, the average
availability assumed, in the light of statistical records for light-water
reactors (LWRs), was 55% in the first year of operation and 75% in subsequent
years.
17.       Specific fuel-oil consumption at oil-fired stations of 230 gr/kWh
was assumed for fuel-oil with a calorific value of 10,222 kcal/kg.
18.       For hydro stations  a 50-year life was assumed,for oil-fired and
nuclear stations 25 years and for gas-turbines 20 years.
19.       For hydro stations, "95% hydraulicity" was assumed i.e. a 95%
probability that the worst possible hydrological conditions over a 40-year
period, as represented by the year 1956-57, would occur. Average annual
generation of energy by the hydro stations in the system was based on
average water flows recorded over the 40-year period.
20.       A system load factor of 56% was assumed throughout the forecast
period.
(c) Unit Sizes
21.       For the oil-fired alternative it was assumed that additional capacity



ANNEX 22
Page 6 of 8
would be installed at the Setubal site in view of the economic advantages.
The first two units now under construction there are each 250-MW and it
was assumed that further units would be of the same size, since the advan-
tages of replication were thought to outweigh any possible economies of
scale through going to larger unit sizes in the later part of the period
considered.
22.       For the nuclear alternative, the smallest unit size commercially
available is 670 MW, which was therefore assumed for the purpose of the
comparison. This would represent about 12% of the projected total installed
capacity when it comes into operation at the end of 1983, which is somewhat
high but is considered acceptable since the system by that time will have
the added security of strengthened interconnection at 400 kV with Spain and,
through Spain, with the interconnected European system.
(d) Capital Costs
23.       For the basic comparison, the estimated capital costs at 1976
prices (including physical contingencies) were used. For Setubal III
(250 MW) these were 10,800 Esc/kW (US$435), and for Setubal IV (250 MW)
9,095 Esc/kW (US$ 366). For the two nuclear units of 670 MW each a cost of
22,537 Esc/kW (US$900)was used, based on information from suppliers and a pre-
liminary project design by consultants. To allcw for uncertainty, the com-
parison of the oil-fired and nuclear alternatives was also made assuming
capital costs 20% higher than in the base case.
(e) Fuel Costs
24.       For the oil-fired alternative, the current selling price in Portugal
ex-refinery of 2,000 Esc/ton (US$80) was used rather than the subsidized
price of 1,300 Esc/ton which the electricity supply industry pays. At present,
Portuguese refineries supply all domestic fuel oil needs but in the 1980s it
may be necessary to import incremental requirements. The Portuguese studies
assumed the same cost of 2,000 Esc for this imported oil; in view of all the
uncertainties, this is regarded as a reasonable estimate of the economic cost
of fuel-oil for the purpose of the comparison.
25.       The risk involved in Portugal's dependence on imported oil has also
to be taken into account in evaluating the oil-fired alternative. The minimum
stock of oil considered adequate to keep the oil-fired stations running during
any likely period of interruption of normal deliveries is three months' supply,
the cost of which is a legitimate additional charge to the oil-fired alternative.
26.       For the nuclear alternative, a cost of US$25/lb was assumed for
uranium oxide (U308). Current US charges for fuel fabrication and reprocessing
were assumed.



ANNEX 22
Page 7 of 8
27.       In view of the uncertainties, the effects on the comparison of
fuel costs 20% higher and 20% lower than the figures quoted were also tested.
(f) Operating and Maintenance Costs
28.       For the oil-fired alternative annual fixed operating and mainte-
nance costs of 147 Esc/kW were assumed, based on experience with existing
oil-fired stations. The corresponding assumption for nuclear stations was
308 Esc/kW.
(g) Foreign Exchange
29.       The Portuguese currency is floating.  The exchange rate used in
the Portuguese comparative studies was 25 escudos = US$1. This rate has
been adopted here for the basic comparison of the alternatives but the
effect of a 20% higher value of foreign exchange (i.e. 30 Esc = US$1) was
also tested.
B. Results of Comparison
30.       The cost streams associated with the alternative oil-fired and
nuclear developments are shown at Attachment 1, together with their present
worths over a range of discount rates from 6-18%. The results indicated
that the nuclear alternative has the lowest present worth, up to a discount
rate of 13.8%. Since the opportunity cost of capital in Portugal is probably
around 10%, this indicates that the nuclear development is the least-cost
means of meeting future power requirements on the main assumptions used.
31.       This conclusion was tested for sensitivity to changes in the values
for the variables given above. The results, which are summarized at Attach-
ment 2, indicated that the comparison is most sensitive to changes in load
growth, the equalizing discount rate declining below 10% (to about 9.6%)if the
lower load forecast is assumed. The results suggest that it might be desirable
to look carefully at the timing of the introduction of nuclear power if the
trend of the economy over the near future suggests that electricity demand is
more likely to grow in accordance with the lower forecast.
Return on Investment
32.       Since it forms only part (the 1976-78 time slice) of the 1976-86
development program for the power sector, it is not possible to identify
the benefits specifically attributable to the Project, and hence its economic
rate of return. Instead, the rate of return on the proposed development
program for the period 1976-86 has been estimated by comparing the costs and
benefits. The costs are the attributable financial costs of the program (for



ANNEX 22
Page 8 of 8
generation, transmission and distribution), adjusted for taxes, internal
transfers and shadow pricing of unskilled labor, which was valued at 50% of
its money cost in view of the high unemployment in Portugal (open unemploy-
ment was 11% at the end of 1975 and, in addition, there is considerable under-
employment in agriculture and industry). The benefits comprise the revenues
from incremental sales of power attributable to the program, calculated at
current tariff rates 1/, plus cost savings through substitution of generation
from program plants (hydro or nuclear) with low running costs for generation
from existing thermal plants with high running costs. The estimated rate of
return is at least 4.1%. This relatively low figure reflects in part the
large investment program proposed by EdP, partly to make up for past under-
investment in the power sector, and the abnormally high recent inflation in
power plant costs. It also reflects the fact that electricity rates have been
deliberately held down by the government as part of its anti-inflationary
policy. Thus it is estimated that the current average price of electricity is
only about 75% above the 1965 level, compared with general inflation over the
same period (as measured by the Lisbon cost of living index) of 173%. Assum-
ing the tariff increases used in the financial projections (25% January 1, 1977,
15% January 1, 1978 and 15% January 1, 1979), which it is not thought would
reduce demand significantly, the rate of return would be 8.3%. Sensitivity
tests showed that the rate would be about one percentage point lower if foreign
exchange is valued 20% higher.
33.        While the above rate of return calculation is of little signifi-
cance as a measure of the economic worth of the program, it does indicate that,
on average, the prices charged for electricity are less than incremental costs.
To the extent that there is any demand elasticity, such a pricing policy might
tend to encourage wasteful consumption of electricity and over-investment in
the sector.
