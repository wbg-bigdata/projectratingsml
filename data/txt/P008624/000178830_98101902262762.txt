INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
ELECTRICIDADE DE PORTUGAL - EMPRESA PUBLICA, WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF PORTUGAL
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Electricidade de Portugal - Empresa Publica (EdP), with the
guarantee of the Republic of Portugal, for the equivalent of $36 million to
help finance an electric power project. The loan would have a term of 15
years, including 3 years of grace, with interest-at 8.85 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.         An economic report entitled, "Current Economic Situation and Pros-
pects of Portugal," (No. 730a-PO) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on July 1, 1975. Discussions on economic policies were held in Portugal in
February and May 1976. The outcome of these is reflected below. Country data
sheets are attached as Annex I.
Past Performance
3.         During the pre-revolution decade ending in 1973, Portugal's GDP
increased at an average rate of 7.2 percent per annum, with industry and con-
struction growing at an annual rate of 10 percent, services at 6.7 percent
and agriculture at less than 1 percent. However, the fast growing modern
industrial sector was unable to absorb the large pool of the unemployed in
rural areas. In addition, neglect of the agricultural base and heavy in-
volvement in colonial wars induced an exodus of Portuguese to the industrial
countries of Western Europe. This eliminated open unemployment at home but
it also drained the country of valuable human resources. By 1974, emigrants
totaled over one million, or the equivalent of one third of Portugal's present
labor force.
4.         The impressive gains of the Portuguese economy in output were sus-
tained by the efficient use and relatively high rate of investment averaging
some 18-20 percent of GDP. The thrust of development strategy in the pre-
revolution period generally emphasized industrialization, transport, and con-
struction, with relatively little attention paid to the structural weaknesses
and inefficiency of the agriculture and education sectors. The development
process took'place within an economic and social structure based largely on
private enterprise. The Government's low interest rate policy, together with
heavy protection of domestic producers and easy access to credit, fostered pri-
vate local and foreign investments. The outward linkages of the multinational
firms based in Portugal, together with low domestic wages, encouraged exports.
In addition, low domestic prices and political stability stimulated tourism
and remittances from Portuguese abroad on a large and increasing scale. Up

to 1974 the budgetary position remained sound and the balance of payments
showed substantial surpluses, with accumulated foreign exchange reserves
reaching the high level of $1.7 billion at end 1973, and a stock of gold
of about 27.8 million ounces (see para. 7 below).
Recent Developments
5.         The Revolution of April 25, 1974 transformed the institutional
and ownership structure of the Portuguese economy, and caused major changes
in the Government's political and economic philosophy, with Portugal shift-
ing from a dictatorship to a social democracy.4 Following the Revolution,
key sectors were nationalized through a series of governmental decrees (i.e.,
banking and insurance; major industries, such as steel, cement, chemicals,
tobacco; public services, such as transport, communications, and electric
power). As a result, almost the whole financial system and a majority of
the basic industries and services sectors are now under government control.
These measures, however, did not affect foreign investments, which were
generally excluded from nationalization decrees.
6.        The social unrest and political uncertainties characterized by five
changes in governments, together with slack in the OECD economies depressed
the country's overall level of economic activities. There was a serious de-
celeration in the rate of growth of real GDP, domestic investment and exports
during 1974 compared to previous years and the declining trends became even
more pronounced in 1975. Real GDP is estimated to have dropped by 3 percent
in the latter year while unemployment (exacerbated by the influx of refugees,
estimated to number over 300,000, from overseas territories and demobilization
of armed forces prompted by the decolonization decisions of the Government --
but not mitigated by the usual emigration) reached about 9 percent by end
1975. Domestic consumption, which had risen substantially in 1974 under the
impact of massive wage increases, remained at high levels in 1975 and reduced
national savings to low levels.
7.         A high level of imports, in part due to price increases for oil
and most other commodities, together with a steep fall in the value of ex-
ports (about 14 percent in 1975) as well as reduced earnings from tourism
and worker's remittances (lower by 27 percent and 14 percent respectively in
1975 compared to 1974), resulted in heavy deficits in the balance of payments.
Despite an import surcharge of 20 to 30 percent, the current account deficit
is estimated at about $860 million in 1975. To a considerable extent the re-
duction in foreign exchange earnings reflects the economic depression in
Portugal's major trading partners in Western Europe; almost two-thirds of
Portuguese exports went to the European Communities (EC) and European Free
Trade Association (EFTA) countries. The terms of trade also deteriorated by
about 10 percent during 1975. The balance of payments has been affected by
political uncertainties, supply constraints, and reduced competitiveness of
Portuguese exports under the impact of wage-cost increases which were not
offset by exchange rate adjustments. The balance of payments deficits in
1974-75 drained the foreign exchange reserves which declined by $1.3 billion



-- 3 -
during the two years, gross reserves reaching about $400 million at the end of
1975, equivalent to one month of imports. This led to a serious shortage of
liquid foreign exchange. However, following a sale of 128,000 ounces in Decem-
ber 1975 there still remains a gold stock of about 27.7 million ounces valued
at $3.5 billion at current market prices. This gold stock serves as a safety
net which Portugal is using gradually as collateral for borrowing purposes
(see para 16 below).
8.         As a result of reduced economic activity, higher government pay-
ments for subsidized commodities, salary increases for civil servants, and
unexpected expenditures on refugees, the Government budget deficit rose
sharply from 0.5 billion dollars in 1974 to over 1.2 billion dollars in 1975.
This occurred in spite of a drastic reduction of 42 percent in military ex-
penditures. However, the rate of inflation declined from 25 percent in 1974
to 15 percent in 1975, mainly due to reduced investment demand, deceleration
in the rate of wage increases and restrictive monetary conditions.
9.        Despite the deterioration in the general economic situation, no sub-
stantial damage has been done to the traditional economic institutions such as
banks, insurance companies and government departments, all of which continue
to operate effectively. Although social tension and strikes marked the first
two years of the revolution, there is a remarkable degree of management con-
tinuity in production, financial, and technical departments of public and
semi-public enterprises. Furthermore, the workers' committees, created in
early 1975, have progressively established a viable relationship with manage-
ment. In addition, some new institutions (e.g., Institute for State Partici-
pation, a holding company for government-controlled enterprises, and the
Institute for the Support of Small and Medium Industries), relying on the
private sector talent, have been created to support the government's more
direct role in the economy. In spite of the number of governmental reshuf-
fles, the social and reformist thrust of the revolution remained intact. All
cabinets have shown a strong orientation towards correcting past imbalances
and have emphasized the need for land reform and nationalization. However,
political instability did not allow time for setting the foundations of land
reform, organizing the nationalized sector, or defining the role of the
private sector. It was only over the last eight months that a systematic
program for economic recovery was initiated.
Government's Action Program
10.        The present Government has launched an action program which lays
the basis for economic and financial rehabilitation. This program focuses
mainly on the following three crucial issues: (i) austerity in consumption
and increase in savings; (ii) revival of investment and genetation of employ-
ment; and (iii) increase in exports.
11.        Important steps to implement the program have already been taken.
The Government has imposed heavy sales taxes, subjecting most commodities to
a tax ranging from 10 to 40 percent and almost doubling the tax on new cars
and some alcoholic beverages. Other measures included: a continuation of
the May 1975 import surcharges at 20 and 30 percent, covering almost half of



- 4 -
imports; taxes on income from urban property were increased from the previous
12 percent rate up to 20 percent; and taxes on income from agriculture were
raised from 10 to 15 percent. These measures were reinforced with substan-
tial increases over the past year in consumer prices (e.g. gasoline and fuel
oil by 35 to 55 percent, public transport by 20 to 60 percent, telephones by
40 percent, postal rates by 40 percent, cement by 28 percent, and electricity
by about 24 percent). These measures, together with a continuation of a
cautious wage policy, are likely to contain consumption and augment savings.
12.        Simultaneously, efforts are being made to increase investment
which will enlarge GDP and employment. The 1976 budgetary allocation for de-
velopment expenditure is 70 percent above the 1975 level, with emphasis on
lower-income housing and urban development, transport, communications, power
development and rural electrification. Also, investment in the industrial
sector (of which the major part is now under government control) is being
stimulated and a National Development Fund is being established to provide
financial support for nationalized industries.
13.        Negotiations are also under way with EC and EFTA to obtain trade
concessions for Portuguese exports. Special credit facilities and other pro-
motional activities for exporters are being introduced. Efforts are being
made to expand exports to Eastern European and OPEC countries. To induce
larger remittances from migrant workers, preferential accounts have been per-
mitted with exchange guarantees and free convertibility.
Prospects for Growth
14.        The social and economic implications of the Government measures
are likely to be serious for the Portuguese people. Some shortages may de-
velop, but the Government is prepared to control prices of essential commodi-
ties and even ration them if need be. The years 1976, and perhaps 1977, will
be very difficult years. A planned reduction in the balance of payments and
budgetary deficits, and revival of investment, employment and growth in the
economy will require additional measures and more sacrifices. Under the im-
pact of the present measures, however, some growth of GDP and improvement in
other areas is expected in 1976. Investment activity in the manufacturing
sector as well as construction of housing and other civil works would pick up.
The Government has already started a comprehensive review of the financial
situation and investment needs (currently estimated at over $2 billion per
annum) of the nationalized enterprises and initiated technical work on the
preparation of a three to four year development plan. It has also authorized
completion of a petrochemical complex, expansion of steel production, and de-
velopment of natural resources like pyrites and salt. These projects will
be carried out in collaboration with foreign investors or with supplier
credits. To encourage foreign participation the Government issued a foreign
investment code in April 1976, and is studying the possibility of joining the
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. In light of the
recent Parliamentary and forthcoming Presidential elections, it is anticipated
that the economic stabilization measures of the last eight months will be pur-
sued and reenforced by the new cabinet to be installed in early July.



-5-
Creditworthiness
15.        Portugal's medium and long-term external public debt (including
undisbursed) at end September 1975 amounted to $831 million 1/. About 70
percent of the total ($566 million) was direct Government debt, a large part
of which ($332 million or 40 percent of total external public debt) was
incurred for the construction of the Cabora Bassa Dam in Mozambique. Debt
guaranteed by the Government totalled $265 million, of which about $40 mil-
lion represented loans from the World Bank. The remaining guaranteed debts
were owed mostly by large public and private corporations, such as airlines,
railways, electric companies, postal administration, Lisbon municipality and
the National Development Bank. Debt service payments for 1975 were estimated
at $158 million or the equivalent of 5.5 percent of gross foreign exchange
earnings in that year. The amount of non-guaranteed private debt is esti-
mated at about $550 million.
16.       In order to mitigate the foreign exchange shortage the Government
is currently mobilizing external capital, both for balance of payments support
and long-term project loans. With gold as a collateral, Portugal obtained, in
early 1975, $250 million from the Bank for International Settlements and in
January 1976, $250 million from the Federal Republic of Germany's Central Bank
and $50 million from the Swiss National Bank. Furthermore, the IMF, in
December 1975, granted $85.6 million from the oil facility and an additional
$49.0 million in March 1976. In October 1975 the European Communities made a
commitment of $187 million to be disbursed as long-term emergency project aid
through the European Investment Bank. Of this about $56.5 million has already
been committed for a power loan to the Comphania Portuguesa de Electricidade
and a development finance loan to the National Development Bank. For EIB
assistance beyond 1977 discussions on a five year financial protocol are under-
way. Approximately $200 million are available from the US AID for the current
and the next calendar year. The Federal Republic of Germany announced in late
1975 $27 million for project financing. The European Free Trade Association
approved in April 1976 about $100 million in financial assistance for the
promotion of medium- and small-sized industries. Portugal also expects to
obtain bilateral aid from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Norway, and
Japan. Finally, most of the major trading partners of Portugal provided
substantial export credits through export financing agencies in their coun-
tries in the course of 1975, and it is expected that some larger invest-
ment needs would be financed by supplier credits.
17.        As the government program gathers momentum, it will help to over-
come the liquidity squeeze and strengthen the country's economic viability and
its creditworthiness.   It can be assumed that it will take several years to
eliminate the external deficits and that, in the meantime, Portugal will have
1/   Medium- and long-term loans reported by the Ministry of Finance but
excluding a short-term loan of $250 million from the Bank for Inter-
national Settlement against which gold was used-as collateral.

to borrow abroad on a substantial scale. However, even conservative assump-
tions concerning export growth and credit terms show that the country's debt
service ratio is unlikely to go much beyond 10 percent. In light of these
facts and efforts already made and in view of the prospects for growth and
export earnings, Portugal can be considered creditworthy for Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PORTUGAL
18.       There have been five previous loans to Portugal, totalling US$57.5
million equivalent, all for assisting the power sector. Three thermal power
loans were made to Empresa Termoelectrica Portuguesa (ETP) and two hydropower
loans to Hidro-Electrica do Douro (HED). In December 1969 these companies
were merged to form a Government controlled (52 percent) entity, the Companhia
Portuguesa de Electricidade (CPE). CPE, along with fourteen distribution com-
panies, was nationalized on April 16, 1975. All projects were successfully
completed and are now in operation. Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank loans as of April 30, 1976.
19.       After the approval in FY66 of the last power loan, no more loans
were made to Portugal primarily because of the failure of the Government to
mount an effective development effort. In October 1974, the new Portuguese
Administration requested a resumption of Bank activities to provide support,
both financial and technical, for the establishment and implementation of a
sound development program. For the first time in decades, emphasis was placed
on Portugal's own development, coupled with significant reductions in defense
and overseas expenditures.
20.       To respond positively to the Portuguese request, the task of the
Bank was initially to establish a workable relationship with the country,
build up a data base through successive economic and policy discussions, and
attempt to understand, quantify, and evaluate the changes in Government poli-
cies as analyzed in Part I of this report. Furthermore, the Bank had to con-
sider carefully how it could assist in the mobilization of the required ex-
ternal development capital, through direct lending and by acting as a catalyst
for other sources of funds. In the longer term, a Bank lending program should
help in stimulating structural reforms in sectors suffering from major distor-
tions (e.g., transportation), assist in strengthening the economic foundation,
and encourage a more equitable income distribution through special attention
to the low-income groups and less developed regions. While Portugal enjoys a
relatively high GNP per capita ($1410 1/ for the year 1973 according to the
1/   After remaining virtually stationary in 1971-74, resident population is
estimated to have increased by 3.8 percent in 1975 and GNP, in real
terms, has declined by about 3 percent. Consequently, real GNP per
capita for 1975 would show a substantial decline for that year.



- 7 -
1975 Atlas) it remains one of the least developed countries in Europe with a
legacy of very serious social and economic problems, including a highly uneven
income distribution, both among persons and regions.
21.       While some uncertainties remain with respect to Government policies
the measures that have been taken over the last eight months are encouraging.
The proposed sixth loan in the power sector would help meet immediate require-
ments and may encourage additional external financing. Also under considera-
tion is a loan for a highway project to help finance a rehabilitation and main-
tenance program, including new road construction and advisory and training
services to the road and railways agencies as well as to the Ministry of
Transportation. This second project, as the one proposed in this report,
would have a rapid disbursement schedules and would help alleviate the coun-
try's shortage of foreign exchange, and thereby contribute to the recovery and
stabilization programs currently underway.
22.       In the longer term, the Portuguese authorities recognize that con-
siderable investigation and preparation are required to redress the decades
of neglect experienced by sectors of the economy such as agriculture and edu-
cation. It is difficult at this stage for the Bank to indicate in detail how
it will be able to bring its technical expertise to bear on Portugal's future
development. The agricultural sector should certainly receive emphasis in
any proposed program since past Governments have long overlooked this vital
sector. Strengthening of agricultural credit institutions, promotion of rural
development schemes, and, to the extent possible, advice and assistance in the
organization of land reform could be areas where Bank resources might be de-
ployed, to bring about the largest possible impact. These long-term opera-
tions could be preceded, if feasible, by Bank assistance to a high priority
sector in the present Government program, namely: financial support to
medium-sized industries through assistance to a development financing insti-
tution. Furthermore, the economic dialogue initiated in early 1975, and
continually reenforced by periodic missions, will continue. In addition,
following recent discussions, sector review missions are scheduled within
the next six months in water supply, agriculture, education, and tourism.
23.       In short the Bank is making an attempt to respond to a unique sit-
uation in which years of neglect of development objectives have been followed
by basic changes in political and economic policies. Although it will take
time to develop a program which effectively responds to this situation, the
sectors noted above could provide the framework within which a pipeline of
important development projects could be built up.
PART III - THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR
Power and Energy Resources
24.       Portugal is one of the smaller European countries in area and, on
a per capita basis, consumes one of the lowest amounts of electrical energy
in Europe (1314 kWh per capita in 1974). Historically the nation has been



-8-
primarily dependent on hydropower as its main indigenous energy resource.
Existing plants have a capability of about 8,290 GWh per annum in an average
year and plants under construction will have an average output of 2,520 GWh
per annum. Of the remaining hydro potential, however, only about 3,500 GWh
per annum could be economically developed. Since hydrological and geomor-
phological conditions are not favorable for electricity production, Portugal
has had to supplement hydropower increasingly in recent years (especially dry
years such as 1975 and, to date, 1976) with thermal plants primarily using
imported oil. In addition, purchases of power from Spain have offset varia-
tions in hydropower production. Studies are under way to utilize uranium
oxide deposits through a proposed nuclear power facility of about 670 MW. In
view of the scarcity of other indigenous energy resources this would be the
only way to limit the dependence on imported oil for thermal generation.
Power Expansion
25.       During the period of the power sector investment program (1976-86)
the maximum demand for power is forecast to increase by about 140 percent from
2,020 MW in 1975 to 4,905 MW in 1986. This would imply an annual growth rate
in sales of electricity of 8.8 percent to 1980 and 7.9 percent thereafter.
Much of the increased demand will occur in domestic use, as a result of im-
provements in the general standard of living and further extension of rural
electrifica tion. Still, the industrial and commercial share of consumption,
though declining relatively, will remain dominant (67 percent in 1975, 62
percent in 1986). Without adequate supplies of electric power, a resumption
of momentum in industrial growth as well as development in agriculture and
transport will not be possible.
26.       Faced with few options and limited prospects for further natural
resource development it is important that the investment program emphasize
the full use of internal resources to provide a long-term supply of reasonably
priced power. Generating capacity existing or under construction will suf-
fice to meet projected requirements through 1979. Detailed studies are being
carried out to determine the least-cost expansion program. They indicate
that part of the requirements could be economically met by installing addi-
tional hydropower plants but that these would have to be supplemented by 1982
with further thermal generating capacity through an oil-fired plant, since a
nuclear station could not be installed by that date.
27.       After 1982 additional thermal capacity will be required and the
choice has to be made between an oil-fired and nuclear plant. The costs of
the programs based on these alternatives have been compared, the main vari-
ables being capital costs, fuel costs, and load growth. The nuclear program
has the lowest present value of costs up to a discount rate of 13.8 percent
compared with an opportunity cost of capital of around 10 percent, indicat-
ing that it is the least cost program. The former Planning Department of
Comphania Portuguesa de Electricidade (CPE) now incorporated in the new entity
Electricidade de Portugal-Empresa Publica (EdP) has well qualified staff with
extensive experience of power system planning. Computer models are used for
preparing 20-year development studies and medium-term investment plans, with
regular revisions, especially to simulate alternative developments of the



power system in order to determine the least cost program. With this plan-
ning base the expansion plans for the sector will be continually reviewed and
subjected to an examination of the alternatives as conditions change.
Organization
28.       During the last thirty years the power sector has been undergoing
a process of consolidation. According to a 1944 law, all new generating and
transmission facilities were to be developed by companies formed with Govern-
ment help. Accordingly, five companies were established between 1945 and
1954, four for hydro and thermal generation and the fifth for nationwide
transmission. The Government owned considerable stock in these companies
and had a major role in determining the policies followed by each of them.
Government fixed the rates for electricity supply, apportioned revenues, ap-
pointed about a third of the Directors, and approved the appointment of the
chairmen and chief executives of all these companies. Thus, most of the sec-
tor has had a quasi-public character for a long time.
29.       The Bank, through its previous loans to two of the four generating
companies, has encouraged the consolidation of the sector for efficient and
coordinated development. In 1969 the four generating companies and the
nationwide transmission company were merged into CPE with a 52 percent Govern-
ment participation.
30.       The nationalization decree of April 16, 1975 took the consolidation
of the sector a step further. CPE and the fourteen distribution companies
serving different regions were thereby to be merged and on July 1, 1976 power
generation, transmission and distribution will come under the control of one
entity. The nationalization decree also revoked the charter authorizing the
Electra del Lima Company to operate the Lindoso hydro generating and transmis-
sion scheme. All facilities are to be taken over by the State upon agreement
between the Government and the company. Lastly, the decree set up a Reorgani-
zation Commission, initially to recommend the structure of the new entity
(EdP) and thereafter to oversee its absorption of the remaining municipal
electricity distribution enterprises.
31.       With-respect to the nationalized holdings, the decree recognized
the obligation of the State to properly compensate all shareholders. In the
case of the takeover of the assets of Electra del Lima (noted above), the
negotiations for compensation are currently underway. Regarding all share-
holders of CPE and the fourteen distribution companies, the Government has
advised the Bank that first, the shareholders have registered theit ownership
to permit the State to evaluate its obligations; and second, the Council of
Ministers is considering proposals to compensate by means of treasury bonds,
payments of which for the foreign shareholders (approximately 9 percent of

of the scheme, however, must be given by the Legislative Assembly which will
only convene in July. The procedure is in accordance with the new constitu-
tion, which came into effect on April 25, 1976. The Executive Directors will
be advised of progress in this area in connection with the next loan proposed
for Portugal.
32.       EdP will become operative as an autonomous national company under a
charter approved by the Council of Ministers in May. It will actually become
a legal entity and start operations on July 1, 1976. The structure of EdP
would consist of a central management, while the nationalized enterprises
continue to operate in their present form. The advantages of such a structure
are that it eliminates unnecessary disruption which could result from the
imposition of a completely new organizational structure on all the constituent
units. Although EdP's charter does not grant it full autonomy in day-to-day
operations, the Bank has been advised that the Government intends that in
actual practice EdP would have such operational autonomy. The operating
procedures, however, will be developed as the entity begins to function.
33.       In its relations with the Government, EdP would be administratively
responsible to the Ministry of Industry and Technology. To insure coordina-
tion within the sector, representatives of technical ministries and the
Ministry of Finance are appointed to the governing Board of Directors.
Before nationalization these government departments were responsible for
various aspects of the power sector.
Financing
34.       In the past the major part of the capital required for development
was secured in the Portuguese and European capital markets through the initia-
tive of the respective enterprises. This capital was raised annually, as re-
quired, on a cash flow rather than a project basis.   Consequently, financial
planning relied on ready access to sources of funds. Since the revolution of
April 25, 1974, however, the capital market within Portugal has significantly
diminished and only recently has it shown signs of renewed activity with the
reopening of the Stock Exchange. The Government dominates the internal market
and will play a key role in future financing of the sector. Because the dif-
ferent constituent units now forming EdP have maintained contacts with finan-
cial institutions throughout Europe, EdP will be in a better position to ob-
tain loans and suppliers' credits as appropriate. These continued external
contacts have helped provide about $90 million in 1975 and about $64 million
in the first half of 1976. With financial support from the EIB and the World
Bank, it is hoped that other lenders will also show an interest in Portugal.
Furthermore, the domestic capital market, and especially the banking system
has the capacity to support the investment program and it is expected to be
the major supplier of funds. Negotiations are near completion for a 1.75
billion escudo ($70 million, equivalent) loan from the Caixa Geral de
Depositos and the National Development Bank, both major institutions in the
banking sector.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
35.       The project is the 1976-78 tranche of the power sector investment
program for the period 1976-1986. The object of the program is to provide
the least costly electric power supply to meet future requirements through an
integrated power sector handling production, transmission and distribution of
electrical energy throughout the country. The project is summarized in Annex
III and described in detail in the Appraisal Report entitled "Appraisal of
Sixth Power Project -- Portugal", dated June 8, 1976 (995-PO) which is
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors. This project was
appraised in September-October 1975 and negotiations took place in M4ay 1976.
The Portuguese Delegation was led by the Secretary of State for Energy and
Mines, Mr. Marques Vidiera, and includedIrepresentatives of the Ministry of
Finance, the Reorganization Commission ou the Ministry of Industry and
Technology aftd the CPE.
Project Description
36.       The 1976-78 tranche of the investment program is an ambitious under-
taking involving work on new generating facilities (about 3300 MW of new ca-
pacity) with related transmission and distribution facilities. The increase
in generating capacity consists of hydroelectric power (48 percent), conven-
tional thermal power (33 percent) and nuclear power (19 percent). This in-
vestment program would assist in providing Portugal with ample energy to supply
the industrial and domestic market growth projected for the years 1976-86. It
would also permit EdP to engage in mutually advantageous power exchanges with
other European countries via the 400-kV transmission line between Portugal and
Spain to be constructed as part of the project to improve the existing inter-
connections. As a result the Portuguese power sector will be able to install
and operate large generating units economically. In addition, the internal
transmission lines and associated substations included in the project will
improve the transmission grid within Portugal and assist the efforts for
complete rural electrification.
Project Execution
37.       The proposed Bank loan would be made to EdP as soon as it comes into
being. In the implementation of its investment program, EdP would need to con-
centrate on both construction of particular facilities and development of policies
designed to ensure uniform and efficient operations. Although this task will be
difficult, the past performance of the power sector in the construction and oper-
ation of power facilities has been satisfactory as demonstrated by the imple-
mentation and operation of hydro and thermal projects. Through association with
other European power companies and consulting firms, the experience lacking in
nuclear plant construction and operation can be secured.
38.       Among the'responsibilities facing EdP, other than construction,
are several important objectives necessary to ensure the maintenance of man-
agement standards and efficient plant utilization. Included in these objec-
tives are: (1) rationalization of electricity tariffs; (2) introduction of



- 12 -
uniform wage and salary policies; (3) standardization of accounting systems
and operating regulations; and (4) development of a system to monitor tech-
nical and financial performance. Each of these objectives, as detailed be-
low, will contribute to satisfactory sector development in the future.
39.       The rates presently in use by the fourteen distribution entities
vary widely. These and the rates of CPE need to be rationalized. They will
require proper restructuring to be consistent with national energy policies.
Consequently, rationalized tariffs taking into account marginal costs of sup-
ply would be introduced and implementation begun by December 31, 1977 (Sec-
tion 5.05, Loan Agreement).
40.       Wage policies differ widely among the enterprises now merged into
EdP. To achieve uniformity and promote the retention of qualified and expe-
rienced personnel, EdP will need to initiate an early review of wage policies.
The impact of the likely wage increases for those on the lower scales would be
somewhat reduced for EdP by the fact that the highest paid staff viz. those in
CPE and the distribution enterprise serving the Lisbon area, will represent
about 60 percent of the total EdP staff.
41.       Essential to the management of EdP is the immediate development of
standardized accounting practices throughout the new company; the provision
for depreciation of assets; and the establishment of a management information
system. The accounting changes are to be implemented by January 1, 1978
(Section 5.01, Loan Agreement); the depreciation rates will apply to the
financial statements commencing with 1977 (Section 5.03, Loan Agreement);
and EdP will develop by December 31, 1977 key indicators for monitoring EdP's
technical and financial performance (Section 4.06, Loan Agreement).
42.       The power sector has always benefited from very satisfactory assis-
tance of consultants. Foreign engineering consultants have been used in the
preparation of designs for thermal power plants and transmission lines. It is
required that for preparation of bid documents, evaluation of bids and con-
struction supervision, EdP will continue to employ consultants with satisfac-
tory qualifications, experience and conditions of employment.
Project Cost and Financing
43.       The estimated cost of the first tranche of the investment program
is $1,124 million, of which the foreign exchange component is $380 million
(see Annex III). Physical contingencies are estimated on average at 10 per-
cent of overall cost of the three year program, and price contingencies have
been calculated by compounding at estimated annual rates of increase ranging
from 14 and 12 percent for local costs in 1976 and 1977-78 to 10 and 8 percent
for foreign expenditures.
44.       The proposed Bank-loan of $36 million, equivalent, would be disbursed
against an agreed list of goods which is composed of. equipment and materials
related to generation, transmission, and distribution activities-included
in the 1976-78 tranche. The proposed loan amounts to about 9 percent of the



- 13 -
foreign expenditures for 1976-78 and 3 percent of the total project cost (ex-
cluding interest during construction). Financing for the project, in addition
to the proposed Bank loan, is to be composed of a combination of internal cash
generation and Government equity participation and loans amounting to about 31
percent and other loans and suppliers credits for the remaining 66 percent.
Financial Aspects
45.       Under the earlier Bank loans to the sector, the borrowers agreed to
generate internally at least 10 percent of their yearly construction require-
ments. This was met by the borrowers consistently through 1974. Because
CPE's rates to the distributing companies remained unaltered from 1966 through
1974, the self-financing level of the combined enterprises now forming EdP
decreased from 27 percent in 1973 to 10 percent in 1974. The rate of return
on average net fixed assets in service, dropped from around 8 percent in 1973,
to under 6 percent in 1974 and slightly above 1 percent in 1975. The unsatis-
factory performance in 1974 is partly explained by substantial salary adjust-
ments in 1974 (about 33 percent increase in wage bill) and, to a lesser ex-
tent, the increased cost of imported oil. The poor performance in 1975 was
due to the absence of any load growth because of general recession and un-
settled conditions in the country, a dry year restricting hydro production
and necessitating increased thermal generation and a four-fold increase in
the cost of power imports from outside the country, and a 25 percent average
salary increase in October 1975. Although in 1976, sales are expected to rise
about 6 percent, hydrological conditions are worse than in 1975 requiring
greater thermal generation and imports of nearly 13 percent of total energy
requirements from France. The full impact of the 25 percent salary increase
is also felt in this year. As a result, gross income is expected to fall
short of operating expenses before interest by 16 percent.
46.       The financial covenant under the proposed loan requires a cash
generation sufficient to finance a reasonable proportion of the Borrower's
average cost of investment in power facilities in the current year and pre-
ceding year (Section 5.02 Loan Agreement). Since EdP is newly established
such flexibility will permit the Borrower to set a realsitic schedule for
improving the percentage financed internally over the coming years. The
recent 24 percent rate increase approved in May is a step toward improving the
internally financed portion of the development plan. The Bank understands
that it is the Government's intention that EdP will generate an internal cash
flow of about 30 percent of their average investment requirements in 1978 and
1979 by the year 1979. This is a reasonable objective.
47.       The financial forecasts are based on estimated power demand and as-
sume no adverse effect from the expected rate increases. The Government
agreed to provide funds for the implementation of the Project in 1976-78 in
the event EdP cannot raise these funds (Section 2.02 Guarantee Agreement).
48.       The other financing sources for the project are domestic banks,
suppliers credits, and foreign banks. It is assumed that 54 percent of the
required financing would come mainly from national lending institutions and



- 14 -
suppliers credits (see para. 34). Out of $187 million of emergency aid from
the EC, noted in paragraph 16, the EIB approved in April 1976 a $40 million
loan to supplement power sector expenditures during the project period.
Portugal also expects the new power company to obtain financing credits from
abroad. In order that EdP's incurrence of debt liability may be kept under
review, EdP will seek the Bank's prior approval for any borrowing if as a
result the long-term indebtedness of the Borrower will exceed 1.5 times the
sum of the Borrowers' equity capital and surplus existing on the date of such
incurrence (Section 5.04, Loan Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
49.       Contracts for equipment and supplies would be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's "Guide-
lines for Procurement". A preference of 15 percent or applicable duties,
whichever is less, would be granted to Portuguese manufacturers who partic-
ipate. Foreign suppliers are expected to win contracts totalling at least
$19 million equivalent. Assuming that Portuguese suppliers win all other
contracts under ICB procedures, this would imply additional foreign exchange
expenditure of well over $21 million. The total foreign exchange component
of the list of goods would thus amount to at least $40 million equivalent.
50.       The Bank loan would be disbursed against 100 percent of foreign ex-
penditure for imported equipment and materials or 100 percent of ex-factory
costs of locally manufactured goods. We would expect disbursements to begin
in the last quarter of 1976 and be completed by June 30, 1979 or within two
and one-half years after loan effectiveness.
Environment
51.       Within Portugal, a State Commission on Environment is responsible
for ensuring that environmental factors are taken into consideration before
projects are approved. All technical ministries are represented on this
Commission. The Commission is preparing detailed legislation to provide for
stronger controls in the future. In view of this and since (i) hydroelectric
plants are subject to strict licensing procedures; (ii) conventional steam
plants are mainly fueled by imported fuel oil and pose no environmental
problems with enforcement of air emission standards; and (iii) the possible
nuclear power plant would be subject to international environmental standards,
no adverse environmental effects would be caused by the proposed project.
Audit
52.       Under the loan agreement, the EdP would have its accounts audited
annually by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank and submit to the
Bank the audited financial statements and the audit report within four months
after the close of each fiscal year (Section 5.06 Loan Agreement).

Justification
53.      As part of the long range (1976-1986) development program this proj-
ect would contribute directly to meeting the demand growth expected during the
period 1976-1986. The trend growth rate of electricity consumption since 1964
has been 8.4 percent per annum, and of system maximum demand, 9.6 percent per
annum. The forecast demand is based on an estimated 8.2 percent per annum
average growth rate of sales and assumes that economic recovery will start
during 1976. Assuming the recovery is delayed somewhat an alternative fore-
cast results in an average growth rate of about 7.8 percent per annum.
54.       Since the project forms only a portion of the overall 1976-86 power
expansion investment program, it was not possible to calculate the rate of re-
turn on the project in isolation from the total program. The return on the
whole program was therefore estimated, using incremental revenues plus cost
savings attributable to the program as an approximate measure of the benefits,
and adjusting the financial costs for taxes, internal transfers and shadow
pricing of unskilled labor to obtain the corresponding cost stream. Assuming
rate increases used in the financial projections, which are not expected to
significantly affect demand, the return would be at least 8.3 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
55.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Electricidade de
Portugal - Empresa Publica the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic
of Portugal and the Bank, and the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
56.       Provisions of the Loan Agreement of special interest were noted
in paragraphs 39, 41, 46 and 48.
57.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
58.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
