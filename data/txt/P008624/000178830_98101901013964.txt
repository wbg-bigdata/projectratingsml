PORTUGAL: SIXTH POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 1301-PO)
PREFACE
The Project consisted of the power subsector investment program of
Electricidade de Portugal (EDP) for the period 1976-78 for which Loan 1301-PO
of Us$36.0 million was made in September 1976. The Loan Agreement became
effective in December 1976 and the loan, which has been fully-disbursed, was
closed in December 1980. The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by
the Europe, Middle East and North Africa Regional Office based on the
appraisal report and other documents in the Bank's files, a completion report
prepared by EDP and the findings of a project completion mission which visited
Portugal in April 1981.
The PCR summarizes the main points of interest especially the
difficulties in handling the many unresolved questions concerning the power
sector at appraisal, changes in project scope, some aspects of procurement and
the achievements under the project in regard to institution-building.
Following normal procedures, a draft copy of the report was sent to
the Borrower (EDP) and the Guarantor (Government) for their comments.
Comments were received from EDP and they have been taken into account in
finalizing the report. They are also reproduced as an attachment to the
report.

SIXTH POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 1301-PO)
HIGHLIGHTS
The project comprising the investment in the power sector (expansion
of generation, transmission and distribution facilities) for the period
1976-78 was intended to meet the forecast growth in electricity demand during
this period and to maintain reliability of the power system. It also had as
its objective the strengthening of the power sector through the establishment
and development of EDP as a sound and efficient utility. All the project
objectives were fully achieved except for the self-financing objective.
The original investment program was altered (for justifiable reasons)
and therefore it is difficult to make a meaningful comparison between actual
and estimated costs and implementation time. Nevertheless, some components
took longer than expected due to several factors, e.g., organizational changes
in the utility, delays in procurement which arose partly from the Government's
policy of encouraging local manufacture of equipment and the utility's
unfamiliarity with Bank procurement procedures (PCR paras 3.1.1-3.6.1).
Institutional perfonnance under the Loan was excellent except in the
financial area. EDP has satisfactorily addressed all the problems it faced at
its formation in 1976 and has developed into a very sound and efficient
utility. It has introduced uniform policies and procedures in all areas such
as personnel management, finance and accounting, insurance, etc., in place of
the diverse practices previously followed by the 15 merged companies. Tariffs
which had varied widely over the country have been rationalized and uniform
tariffs have been introduced throughout EDP's area of operations.   EDP also
successfully mobilized adequate resources to implement the investment program
for 1976-78. However, the integration of municipal power distribution
utilities with EDP has been slower than expected and about two-thirds of the
original 200 such utilities were still being operated by municipalities at the
end of the Project period (PCR paras 5.8.1, 5.8.2, 6.1.1-6.4.2).
Largely because of adequate tariff increases, the financial results
of the utility were satisfactory through 1979.   Subsequently, however, the
severe drought conditions adversely affected the financial results--the
utility's self-financing level in 1980 was only one-half the target of 30% and
in 1981, its cash flow did not cover its debt service requirements.
Collection of accounts receivable, particularly from large industries and
other distribution utilities, is also becoming an increasing problem. These
issues are addressed in the proposed Seventh Power Project (PCR paras
5.3.1-5.7.1).

Actual energy sales were slightly higher than the estimates (PCX para
4.1.1). The recalculated incremental rate of return on the project is 13%
compared to 8% estimated at appraisal (PCR para 7.1.1).
The Bank played a constructive role in the development of the
Borrower and showed flexibility on matters such as re-allocation of loan
proceeds, amendment to the financial covenant (PCR paras 8.1.1, 8.1.2).



PORTUGAL - PUWER VI
(Loan 1301-POR)
I. INTRODUCTION
Organization of the Electric Power Sector and Bank's Involvement
1.1.1      According to a 1944 law, all new geueration and transmission
facilities were to be developed by companies formed with Government help.
Accordingly, five companies were established between i945 and 1954, four for
hydro and thermal generation and the fifth for nationwide transmission.   The
Government owned considerable stock in these companies and had a major role in
determining the policies followea by each of them. The Government fixed the
rates for electricity supply, apportioned revenues, appointed about a third of
the Directors and approved the appointment of the Chairmen and Chief
Executives of all these companies. Thus the companies, though formally
private, had a quasi-public character.
1.1.2      During the period 1963-1966, the Bank made five power loans to
Portugal totalling US$57.5 million, out of which three were for thermal
generation and two for hydro electric generation. The details of these loans
are as follows:
(a)   Loan 362-PO (US$7.5 million; 1963) for a 210-MW hydro power
project on the River Douro;
(b)   Loan 363-PO (US$5 million; 1963) for a 50-MW steam turbo
generation uniit at a coal-fired station;
(c)   Loan 412-PO (US$15 million; 1965) for the first stage (125
MW) of the Carregado oil-fired station;
(d)   Loan 452-PO (US$20 million; 1966) for a 180-MW hydro power
project on the River Douro; and
(e)   Loan 453-PO (US$10 million; 1966) for a second 125-MW unit at
the Carregado thermal station.
All the projects were successfully completed and are now in operation.
1.1.3      In order to remove certain shortcomings in the system being divided
amongst five companies and in line with the Bank's long-standing
recommendations during its association with the sector, the four generating
companies and the nationwide transmission company were merged into one company
in December 1969 (titled CPE in short) with 52% Government participation.   The
above position continued through April 15, 1975 at which time except for small
generating centers owned by 14 distribution companies (5% of the total) which
carried out distribution at high and low tension in the areas covered by their



- 2 -
concessions, CPE was solely responsible for generation and transmission of
power, and for sale of electricity to the distribution companies, about 20
power-intensive industries and some 200 municipalities which retailed power
supply at low tension in residential areas.
1.1.',     The large number of enterprises operating in the sector inevitably
caused overlapping of networks and a wide diversity of rates and inhibited
coordinated development of the sector.   In order to promote such coordinated
development, Government nationalized CPE and the 14 distribution companies
with effect from April 16, 1975. Under a subsequent law, based on the
recommendations of a Reorganization Commission appointed by Government,
Electricidade de Portugal (EDP) was established as a legal entity on July 1,
1976, with headquarters in Lisbon and having a charter providing the legal
framework for its operations.
1.1.5      In order to avoid any unnecessary disruption which would result
from the imposition of a completely new organizational structure on all the
constituent units, the nationalized enterprises continued in their early form
and the only addition in EDP was of a central management organization with
central staff departments for planning, engineering, finance, economics,
personnel organization, legal, etc. All policies were formulated and major
decisions taken by this central management organization.   EDP also started
functioning under the administrative control of a single ministry unlike in
the past when several government ministries and institutions regulated power
sector development and operations, with a consequent lack of coordinated
planning and development. Para 6.3.1 describes the subsequent organizational
changes in EDP.
I.. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Project Origin
2.1.1      Following the Revolution of April 25, 1974, the Portuguese
authorities requested a resumption of Bank assistance, both technical and
financial. The first request was made when the Minister of Foreign Affairs
paid a visit to the Bank President in August 1974 and the second in October
1974 during the Annual Meeting when a Portuguese delegation met with the Bank
President. The Bank proposed that one of the sectors best suited to the
purposes of renewing lending operations in Portugal would be the power sector,
in view of the Bank's previous extended and satisfactory experience of the
sector. Following an identification mission in January 1975, a "sector" loan
was identified as a suitable vehicle for the lending process and in accordance
with the July 1975 CPP Review decision, it was decided to mount an appraisal
mission to appraise the power sector for a proposed "sector" loan of
approximately USS30 million (subsequently raised to $36 million). A special
reason for choosing such a loan for the lending process was the advantage of
relatively quick disbursement, an important consideration in view of
Portugal's serious financial plight. In the course of loan processing, the
loan was appropriately treated as one for a time-slice of the sectoral
investment program rather than as a pure sector loan.

Project Preparation and Field Appraisal
2.2.1      The Bank Project was the power sector investment program for the
period 1976-1978, the object of which was to provide the most economical
electricity supply to meet the forecast growth in demand and to maintain
required reliability of the power system. The past performance of the power
sector in the planning; construction and operation of power facilities had
been satisfactory. The Project was prepared entirely by the Portuguese with
the exception of the proposed 670-MW nuclear power plant (the first in the
country) which was planned to be completed in 1983. For the nuclear station,
a group of expatriate consultants had been commissioned to prepare the design
and was to be responsible for technical evaluation of the proposed equipment.
All legal and licensing problems related to the nuclear plant had generally
been resolved and all preparatory studies and investigations had also been
completed. The main question the Government had to decide was whether the
plant should be ordered in 1976 for commissioning in 1983 or whether it should
be deferred in favor of installing a further two 250-MW oil-fired units.
Ultimately, the Government decided not to go ahead with the nuclear option
(para 3.1.2).  In respect of all other facilities, studies had already been
made and design work already-undertaken by the Portuguese.
2.2.2      An appraisal mission visited Portugal in September-October 1975 and
identified many uncertainties and unresolved questions concerning the power
sector, notably the following;
(a)   Political Instabilitv.  Although the mission did not observe
any violent opposition to the new Government, which was
formed while it was in Portugal, press reports indicated
increasing polarization between the political parties,
accompanied by growing violence;
(b)   Sector Organization.  The future organization of the sector
had yet to be settled. By the decree of April 1Q75, prior to
which some parts were already wholly or partly publicly
owned, the sector was taken to the first stage of
nationalization. Since that decree was issued, a
Reorganization Commission had been considering the future
structure, organization and management of the nationalized
part of the sector (which would contain more than 90O of the
whole power sector), and the question of compensation for the
previous owners. The conclusions of this commission were
expected to be made known to Government by the end of October
1975 and, if they were approved, as appeared likely, were
expected to pass into law soon after. The Bank's attitude to
a "sector" loan depended very greatly on the structure,
authority and autonomy of the national power authority to be
set up, and it was considered difficult to write a meaningful
appraisal report in the absence of positive legislation
enshrining these aspects. The mission's impression of the
Reorganization Commission's proposals was that the final
institutional arrangements were likely to be acceptable to
the Bank;



(c)   Sector Development Program. The sector development program
was subject to the Government's decision on the proposals
submitted by CPE. Preliminary assessment by the mistion of
these proposals indicated that the least-cost program was
that requiring the ordering of the first nuclear station the
following year. Should Government reject this in favor of
the oil-fired alternative, there could be problems regarding
the justification of the program;
(d)   Items for Bank Financing. As a result of discussions with
CPE and the distribution undertaking responsible for
electricity supply in Lisbon, the mission was able to
identify a provisional list of items in the proposed
development program suitable for Bank financing. However, it
was not considered possible to agree on a final list until
the Government had decided on the future program and the new
national power authority had come into operation; and
(e)   Financing Plan.  The new Government was unable to do more
than concentrate on immediate needs for finance and as a
first step proposed to develop the investment plan for 1976
and to mobilize financial support for it. Longer-term plans
and financial requirements were unlikely to be prepared
before early 1976. No financing plan for the power sector
development program had then been formulated, although for
the purpose of a sector loan a well defined financing plan
was a prime necessity.
2.2.3      The issue was whether the processing of the loan should be delayed
until the above uncertainties were resolved.  The mission's view was that this
would be undesirable, since it would weaken, if not eliminate, the Bank's
ability to influence the formulation of sector policies. In the event, the
Bank decided to proceed with the loan processing accordingly, although this
necessarily meant that until negotiations, the appraisal report would be based
on many speculative assumptions and the mission's judgement of the likely
outcome of the uncertainties. Even the final loan documents reflected some of
these uncertainties, especially in regard to the financial covenant. (See
para 5.1.1 for a further discussion of this.)
Negotiations and Approval
2.3.1      No major issues delayed loan processing although EDP, the borrower,
was established only after the Board approval. Negotiations took place in May
1976. Board approval and loan signing followed successively in June 1976 and
September 1976. The key issues on which agreement was reached at negotiations
are discussed below.
(a)   Revenue Covenant - The draft loan documents had provided for
the achievement of 30% self-financing for 1977 and
thereafter. While agreeing that 30% self-financing could be
a long-term objective, the Portuguese delegation at first
could not agree to specific targets for the interim period
for the following reasons;



-5-
(i)   the then existing political situation--only a new Government
coming to power (around July 1976) after the Presidential
elections could take vital decisions;
(ii)  studies were under way regarding sectoral objectives;
(iii) Portugal was having a second consecutive dry year in 1976,
making reasonable forecasts for the immediate future
difficult; and
(iv)  some phasing of the investment program was under
consideration.
Accordingly, the delegation stated that it could only formally
agree to the 10% self-financing level set by Government in 1966
following the fourth and fifth power loans. However, in the end,
it was agreed and recorded in a supplemental letter that beginning
with FY79 a satisfactory objective would be self-financing of at
least 30% of the average cost of the construction program for the
current and preceding years and that intermediate targets for 1977
and 1978 towards the achievement of the long term objective would
be established before December 31, 1976.
(b)   List of Goods - A list of goods (of about US382.5 million
equivalent) with a minimum estimated foreign exchange cost of
US440 million equivalent was identified as suitable for
procurement through ICB. On the basis of this list of goods,
a total loan of US436 million was proposed; and
(c)   Debt Service Covenant - It was agreed to apply to the
proposed loan the debt-equity ratio limitation of 2:1 used in
the 1966 loans instead of the then current debt service
covenant requiring Bank's prior approval of borrowings if the
debt service ratio was not at least 1.5;1.
2.3.2      There were no special effectiveness conditions and the loan became
effective on December 23, 1976.
2.3.3      Attachment I sets forth the major covenants of the Guarantee and
Loan Agreements. Except in regard to the revenue covenant (see para 5.1.2),
compliance with the covenants was satisfactory.

III. IMPLEMENTATION
Changes in Project Scope
3.1.1      The main changes in the program of expansion of generation
facilities were;
(a)   deferral of construction of the first-nuclear power plant
which was planned to be built near Lisbon;
(b)   acceleration of construction of new hydropower projects; and
(c)   decision to build base-load steam power plants using imported
coal.
3.1.2      The least cost studies had indicated in 1975 that the development
program including the nuclear power plant (670 MW) had the lowest present
worth (up to a discount rate of 14%). Meanwhile, the prices of nuclear
equipment and fuels had risen much faster than corresponding prices of
conventional steam power plants using either fuel oil or coal. There was also
mounting public reaction against nuclear energy, which had become a subject of
political discussion. All this led to the decision of Government not to go
ahead with the first nuclear power plant. In order to meet the growth of-
demand, ETP had decided to build a coal-fired power plant at Sines. The
import of coal would diversify energy sources in the country and lessen the
country's heavy dependence on imported crude oil. The coal-fired steam power
plant at Sines would be of 1,200-MW capacity (4 x 300 MW), the first unit to
be commissioned by the end of 1994, and the others following at intervals of
about 11 months.  A fourth unit at the Setubal steam station was added as a
substitute (together with the coal-fired plant) for the delayed nuclear power
plant, which was originally planned for commissioning in 1983.
3.1.3      Development of the hydropower potential has been accelerated by
adding new hydropower projects. Alto Lindoso, Torrao and Sela with an
aggregate capacity of 914 MW (1,298 GWh).  The construction of multipurpose
projects such as Alqueva (300 MW) was postponed due to unresolved problems
involving other project users (agriculture, water supply, etc.).
3.1.4      Transmission and distribution facilities were completed without any
major modification.
Implementation Schedule
3.2.1      In view of the nature of the Project, it is difficult to compare
the estimated implementation schedule with the actual one. There were some
delays in construction (e.g. Crestuma Project) mainly due to the
organizational changes in EDP. These problems were substantially resolved
over time.



-8-
Reporting
3.3.1      EDP has consistently maintained a high standard of reporting, both
in timeliness and quality; in fact, it has been a model borrower in this
respect.
Procurement
3.4.1     - Two main procurement problems arose during implementation of the
Project:
(a)   One problem arose from the Government's policy of encouraging
local industry, under which EDP has been required to conclude
long-term contracts with local manufacturers for the supply
of turbines, generators, and other hydromechanical and
electrical equipment for its-generating plants.  Contracts
have been signed between EDP, the local manufacturers and
their licensors in other West European countries specifying
the equipment to be manufactured in Portugal, setting up of
base prices and their revisions, payment conditions,
execution of contracts, quality control, etc. In pursuance
of this policy, Government decided to restrict bidding for
the turbo-generator for the Setubal 3 plant to the two local
manufacturers. Such restricted bidding made the goods
ineligible for Bank financing, and the Bank agreed to
reallocate the amount of the loan allocated to this equipment
(US314 million, being 39% of the total loan) to other
categories (Crestuma hydropower project and
transmission/distribution) in order to enable EDP to utilize
the full amount of the loan.
(b)   The second problem arose as a result of the decision of
Government and EDP to award the contract for the bulb units
of the Crestuma hydropower plant (after ICB) to the nominally
second lowest bidder in pursuance of Government's policy of
fostering specialization amongst local manufacturers. The
two lowest bidders were both Portuguese and the difference
between their bids was not significant. Although the Bank
initially had reservations regarding the proposed contract
award, subsequently the Bank agreed, following a visit by a
Portuguese delegation for this purpose, that if the
evaluation showed only a minor difference in bid prices, then
EDP had the right to exercise its judgement in selecting
either one, taking into account non-quantifiable factors such
as compliance with the policy objective of Government. Thus
the contract was awarded as proposed to the local
manufacturer which, according to the Government directive,
would be specializing in the manufacture of hydropower
equipment.
Costs
3.5.1      In view of the significant change in Project content (paras 3.1.1
-3.1.3), no meaningful comparison of costs is possible. Attachment 2 gives a
comparison of the estimated and actual costs of the Project.



-9-
Disbursements
3.6.1      The original estimates of disbursements and the actual
disbursements are given in Attachment 3. Through June 1979, the disbursements
were only 35% of appraisal estimate but thereafter they picked up fast in FY
1980 and 1981, leaving only *0.4 million equivalent undisbursed as of December
31, 1980. This amount was disbursed in early February 1981, i.e., after the
loan was closed on December 31, 1980; the withdrawal application had been
received here before loan closing. The main reasons for the slow
disbursements through mid-1979 were:
(a)   EDP's slow organizational changes during the initial period
of EDP's life when all the constituent units had to be
integrated into EDP;
(b)   Project revisions;
(c)   exclusion of the Setubal station plant from Bank financing
owing to restricted procurement, the consequent decision to
reallocate $14 million of the loan and changes in the List of
Goods;
(d)   design changes in the Crestuma Hydro Power Plant (main item
for Bank financing);
(e)   slow procurement action initially by EDP owing to
unfamiliarity with Bank procedures;
(f)   methods of payment in awarded contracts; and
(g)   frequent political changes in the country.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.7.1      There was no major problem related to the performance of
consultants, contractors and suppliers.
Environmental Impact
3.8.1      The State Commission on Environment on which all the technical
ministries are represented is responsible for ensuring that environmental
factors are taken into account before projects, including power projects, are
approved. Apart from the general responsibility of the Commission, various
other State agencies have specific responsibilities for environmental
protection.  Construction of hydroelectric power plants is subject to a strict
licensing procedure which requires consideration of environmental factors
before construction is authorized. In the case of steam power plants,
appropriate emission standards are enforced. By careful planning,
transmission facilities are not allowed to mar sceutic beauty. With all these
arrangements, no specific covenant for environmental protection was considered
necessary. The Project has been executed ensuring appropriate attention to
environmental aspects in designs and standards.

IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.1.1      The object of the physical facilities of the Project, namely to
provide the most economical electricity supply to meet the forecast growth in
demand, was fully achieved. Attachment 4 gives the forecast and actual sales
of EDP for 1975-1980 broken down into four categories (industry, transport,
agriculture, and domestic and others). It will be seen that the actual sales
were 3-9% above the appraisal estimates. The deviation is well within the
acceptable range considering the unsettled conditions of 1975 when the
forecast was made.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Revenue Covenant
5.1.1      The revenue covenant under the loan requires EDP to provide from
internally generated funds after.the payment of dividends to Government a
surplus to finance a reasonable proportion of its average construction
requirements (average of previous and current years). Under a supplemental
letter, it was further agreed that beginning with 1979 a satisfactory
objective would be self-financing of at least 30% of its average construction
requirements and that o.bjectives would be established by Government for EDP
for the interim period of 1977 and 1978 with a view to causing EDP to
progressively achieve the 30% level of self-financing for 1979 and
thereafter. However, for both 1977 and 1978, no specific level of
self-financing was prescribed since EDP and Government had, by their tariff
action in 1976, 1977 and 1978 (see para 5.4.1), already demonstrated their
desire to ensure the financial viability of ED?.
5.1.2      Government reported in June 1977 that the money market conditions
for the last three years had prevented the issue of bonds by EDP and other
public sector institutions and that financing institutions were more prepared
to refinance short-term debt (maturity less than seven years) than to enter
into very long-term lending. Therefore, EDP had to resort more and more to
short-term borrowing which would be refinanced on maturity. In view of this,
EDP and Government proposed that "periodic repayments of long-term debt" for
purposes of computing the self-financing level under Section 5.02 of the Loan
Agreement be restricted to 7% (corresponding to 15 years'.maturity, a
reasonable period) of the outstanding long-term debt at the beginning of the
year if other repayments of loans with amortization periods of up to six years
were offset by new borrowings. This was considered a reasonable request and
was accepted by the Bank.
1977 and 1978 Operating Results
5.2.1      EDP's tariffs were raised, with Government approval, an average 25%
from June 1976, a further 25% from February 1977 and 50% from May 1978. These
tariff increases enabled EDP to achieve a self-financing level of 12% in 1977
and 25% in 1978.



1979 Operating Results
5.3.1      With exceptionally good hydrological conditions and the
implementation of an average 25% tariff increase from mid-November 1979 and a
further levy of a fuel adjustment charge of 0.125 Esc per kWh to compensate
EDP for the increase in fuel oil price from Esc 4,000/ton to Esc 5,000/ton
from September 1979 (the effect of the fuel adjustment charge was to raise the
average rate about 8%), EDP's internal cash generation in 1979 was 37% (there
were no dividend payments in the year).
1980 Operating Results
5.4.1      Contrary to expectations, the new Government formed after the
general elections of December 1979 took action; (i) to raise the fuel oil
price from Esc 5,000 to Esc 7,000 per ton effective January 31, 1980 and to
permit EDP to levy a fuel adjustment charge effective January 31, 1980 raising
the price of electricity 8.5% in 1980; and (ii) to raise EDP's tariffs further
by an average of 18% effective January 31, 1980. (The overall increase in the
price of electricity was therefore 26.5% from January 31, 1980). However,
because of an exceptionally severe drought in 1980 (continuing into 1981),
EDP's cash generation in 1980 was only 15%. This is because EDP's fuel
adjustment charge is designed to recover cost increases assuming normal
hydrological conditions and therefore the large increase in fuel charges
caused by the excessive thermal generation went unrecovered. Given the
druught and the fact that further tariff increases in 1980 were unlikely with
elections due in late 1980, the Bank accepted the low level of cash generation
as satisfactory performance under the covenant, especlally because of the past
readiness of Government and EDP to raise tariffs every year to keep up with
inflation as shown by the following:
Average Amount of Tariff Increase          Date of Increase
(including fuel adjustment)
25%                            June 1976
25%                            February 1977
50%                            May 1978
33%                            November 1979
26.5%                          January 1980
Estimates for 1981
5.5.1      Effective December 31, 1980, the new Government which came to power
after the elections of October 1980 raised EDP's tariffs by an average of
20%. The severe drought conditions continued in 1981 with the result that
despite the above tariff increase, EDP's net cash generation was about minus
38% in 1981, although it would have achieved 23% cash generation if average
hydrological conditions had prevailed. In fact, EDP was not able to meet its
operating expenditure and debt obligations in 1981. The issue of EDP's
non-compliance with the financial covenant in 1981 is being addressed under
the proposed Seventh Power Project.



- 12 -
5.6.1      EDP's income statements, balance sheets and funds statements for
1975-1979 are given in Attachments 5, 6 and 7.
Collection of Receivables
5.7.1      There was one matter which was not a probiem at appraisal, but
which became a serious one after some time, and this was the problem of
collection of receivables for the supply of electricity mainly rrom HV
consumers, particularly municipalities. The outstandings in respect of HV
consumers amounted to 6.2 months' billing as of December 31, 1979, 7.3
months' billings as of June 30, 1980 and 7.2 months' billings as of December
31, 1980 (Attachment 8). The probiem regarding small private industries is
being tackled effectively through threats of disconnection although the
strategy is not so effective in the case of large private industries. In the
case of municipalities, both EDP and Government are unable to enforce payment
for legal and political reasons with the result that their outstandings
amounted to 13.3 months' billings as of June 30, 1980. The outstandings of
municipalities as of December 31, 1980 were 38% more than those at June 30,
1980. In the past, both the President of EDP and the Secretary of State for
Energy and Industry in Government have acknowledged the seriousness of the
problem and agreed that quicker integration of the power facilities of the
remaining municipalities with EDP was the best solution to it. However, with
the present unhurried pace of integration, the problem could be with EDP for a
long time unless corrective measures are taken. In the meantime, EDP is
resorting to additional short-term borrowings to meet the problem of cash
shortage created by the default on the part of the HV consumers. The Bank has
brought the matter repeatedly to the notice of Government and EDP. In view of
its seriousness and the fact that the problem has aggravated over time, the
issue is being handled under the proposed Seventh Power Project as a high
priority issue.
Tariffs
5.8.1      The rates charged to distribution networks (about a third of total
energy supplied in 1974) remained almost unaltered during 1966-1974 and
increases took place only for large consumers directly supplied from the
system. At the time of formation of EDP, medium and low voltage rates varied
widely throughout the country, the ratio of the highest to the lowest domestic
rates being as .high as 3:1. In late 1976, the Reorganization Commission and
Government were already studying the question of rationalization of
electricity rates in the country.
5.8.2      Under section 5.05 of the Loan Agreement, EDP agreed to take all
steps necessary to obtain from Government approval of an adequate revised
structure of its rates for electricity supply which shall take into account
the marginal costs of supply and to implement such revised rate structure not
later than December 31, 1977. Government also agreed to take all action
necessary to enable EDP to commence implementation of such a revised rate
structure not later than December 31, 1977. Accordingly, after studies of
existing tariffs and marginal costs, Government implemented a revised tariff
structure based on marginal costs effective February 1, 1977 for the whole



- 13 -
country i.e. not only for EDP but also for other agencies engaged in
distribution activities. For EDP there was an average 25% increase (a little
more in domestic tariffs and a little less in industry). However, although
the new structure was to provide Portugal with uniform tariffs throughout the
country, actually many municipalities (notably the Porto municipality) chose
to levy lower tariffs and still have tariffs much below EDP's low voltage
tariffs in Lisbon.
Accounts, Insurance etc.
5.9.1      For a discussion of these, see Attachment 1.
VI, INSTITUTIONAL PERPORMANCE
Problems at EDP's Formation
6.1.1      At its formation in July 1976, EDP had to address itself to a large
number of problems, some of which arose out of the need to apply uniform
policies and procedures in entities hitherto following diverse practices.
These problems were mainly:
(a)   organizing itself to function as an autonomous entity;
(b)   rationalization of tariffs which varied widely-over the
country;
(c)   application of coimmion personnel policies and wages and
salaries;
(d)   unification of finance and accounting systems;
(e)   phased integration of about 200 municipal power distribution
units; and
(f)   perhaps most important of all, setting up a satisfactory
financing plan to cover the development program.
Management and Organizational Effectiveness
6.2.1      It is a measure of EDP's strength as an organization and of the
quality of its management that almost all the problems facing EDP during the
unsettled times of 1975 and 1976 have been solved or are in the process of
being solved in an orderly manner. EDP and its management have grown in
strength over the years and EDP has developed into a utility comparable in
efficiency to those in the developed countries.



- 14 -
Reorganization of EDP
6.3.1      When EDP was formed in July 1976 after the nationalization and
merger of 15 companies, each company was retained substantially unchanged so
as to cause minimum dislocation. The first phase of reorganization comprising
the establishment of a headquarters office responsible for policies, direction
and central management with staff departments, and regional offices
responsible for decentralized operational activities was completed by January
1977. EDP has several directorates, one responsible for generation and
distribution equipment and another for the generation and transmission system
and many regional offices responsible for distribution activities. EDP is an
extremely well managed entity and changes, when necessary, are effected
smoothly and painlessly. Through sound management, EDP has been relatively
insulated from the unsettled conditions arising in the country from time to
time. It is now proposed to regroup distribution activities in each region,
with distribution centers to be established in each region covering specific
areas. The final delineation of the jurisdiction of these distribution
centers will depend on the integration of the remaining distribution
facilities in the country with EDP. The emphasis in all past and future
reorganization is decentralization of management to facilitate speedy
decision-making.
Personnel Policies
6.3.2      One important problem for the sector following its nationalization
and the formation of EDP was the large variety of salary scales and terms of
service applicable to the nationalized entities and the need to unify them
progressively within a reasonable period. In place of the plethora of salary
scales that existed in the 15 different enterprises having different criteria
for each salary group, 18 salary groups were established into which each and
every worker of a total of over 13,000 was fitted. A Workers Agreement also
camne into effect in 1978 representing an important step in the progress
towards better and uniform working conditions.
Thtegration of Municipal Undertakings
6.4.1      One of the institutional problems at appraisal was that of
integration of municipal undertakings with EDP. According to Decree Law
205-G/75 of April 16, 1975 under which Government natinalized the 15 power
companies which were later amalgamated to form EDP in July 1976, all assets of
the municipal power-generating and distribution enterprises and other power
enterprises would be transferred to the new entity (EDP). This is still the
law of the country although every Government, whatever its political
complexion, has been somewhat lethargic in implementing it. At the time of
its formation, EDP was responsible for about a third of the distribution
subsector in the country, the remaining distribution activities being the
responsibility of some 200 municipalities, the largest being Porto with
130,000 consumers. It was then hoped that all the municipal undertakings
would be integrated with EDP within two years and with this in view, a special
committee was set up in EDP to make recommendations for a phased integration



- 15 -
of the undertakings with EDP. (No covenant on this matter was provided in the
loan agreement in view of the uncertainties surrounding the issue at the time
of appraisal.) However, the program of integration was much delayed owing to
political and other opposition in the country and the first phase covering 56
muncipalities and 0.3 million consumers was implemented only in M4ay/October
1979. Since then, the power assets of several more municipalities and
federations of municipalities have been integrated with EDPO About 40% of all
distribution activities in the country is still (December 1981) with about 130
municipalities. Porto which was expected to be one of the first to be
integrated would now probably be one of the last. Both EDP and Government
wish to complete the integration quickly (although some dissenting opinions
could be heard now and then) mainly for the following reasons:
(a)    Some municipalities, notably Porto, keep their tariffs lower than
those of EDP and below the levels permitted by Government.
Therefore, unification of tariffs in the country, which is an
objective of Government for the power sector, is not possible
without complete integration of municipal undertakings with EDP;
(b)    at present, owing to technical reasons e.g. the number of points at
which supply is being given to municipalities and the voltage level
at which certain consumers in municipal areas require supply, both
EDP and municipalities serve consumers in the same area, thereby
creating considerable confusion; and
(c)    it would minimize, if not entirely eliminate, EDP's receivables
problem.
Although the need for integration is acknowledged Ln most circles of
Government, the matter is being handled as a delicate issue, without any
deadline for the completion of integration, because of political and other
opposition and the vested interests of municipalities. The matter is being
addressed under the proposed Seventh Power Project.
6.4.2      The fact that so many municipal undertakings have been smoothly
integrated with EDP since 1976, doubling its distribution activities and in
the process, solving such attendant problems as unification of salaries and
operational systems and procedures, attests to EDP's organizational strength
and its ability to handle thorny issues in a systematic manner.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Return on Investment
7.1.1      Since the Project represents a part of the power subsector
development program and includes various components, it would be appropriate
to calculate the rate of return on the development program for the period
1976-86 by comparing the costs and benefits. Actual costs and benefits up to



- 16 -
1980 have been adjusted to that base year using the appropriate price
deflators. Costs over the remaining life of the program's physical facilities
have been re-estimated using 1980 base cost data and basic assumptions as
stated in the SAR. New forecasts of benefits have been made using the latest
available information. The revised rate of return is at least 13% (Attachment
8) which compares favorably with the SAR's rate of 8%, which was based on the
tariff increases used in the SAR's financial projections (25% in 1977, 15% in
1978 and 15% in 1979). The actual tariff increases that were implemented in
order to achieve EDP's financial objectives were substantially higher (50% in
1978, 33% in 1979 and 26.5% in 1980).
VIII. BANK'S PERFORMANCE
8.1.1      The Bank has played a constructive role in the development of EDP
as a strong utility. Through discussions and advice, the Bank has contributed
to the evolution of EDP's legal and organizational structure, helped develop
its planning methodology and procurement practices, and by focusing on the
central issues, helped its development on sound lines. Perhaps most important
of all, the Bank demonstrated by its presence in the sector at a critical time
and by its association with the emerging EDP its confidence in EDP's ability
to overcome its many problems and to establish itself as a sound utility. The
Bank's reassuring presence in the sector also had a catalytic effect in
attracting other creditors, e.g., the European Investment Bank, to invest in
EDP's capital expansion program and thus helped ensure the success of that
program.
8.1.2      The Bank maintained excellent relations throughout with Government
and ED? and showed flexibility on all reasonable proposals made by them.
Examples of such flexibility are. reallocation of 39% of the loan amounting
to USgl4 million in the situation caused by the Government's decision to have
restricted bidding for the equipment for which the amount was originally
allocated; and the Bank's agreement to amend the revenue covenant to provide
for a change in the computation of the debt service.
8.1.3      The Bank identified the right issues at appraisal and provided
appropriate covenants to ensure action. However, the major problem of EDP's
inability to collect its bills from municipalities was not foreseen at
appraisal by the. Bank, nor could this have been foreseen since the problem
arose more because of political pressures than of anything else.
SupDervision
8.2.1      The Bank's supervision work was effective; there was continuity of
Bank staff from appraisal through project completion, and supervision missions
were mounted at regular intervals.

IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.1.1      This was a highly successful lending operation.   Thanks to
excellent maTnagement, EDP achieved all the objectives set at appraisal except
for the self-financing objective. Although the self-financing target was
exceeded in 1979, only half the target was achieved in 1980 on account of a
severe drought. In 1981, the position was very unsatisfactory -1 for EDP
could not meet its debt obligations from cash flow.
Lessons to be Learned
9.2.1      There are three lessons to be learned from this lending operation:
(a)    A strong management can guide a utility successfully through
difficult times and solve even thorny issues in a systematic
manner. It can also to some extent insulate a utility from the
unsettled conditions in the country.
(b)    Even a good utility is often unable to perform well under adverse
exogenous conditions such as drought. Instead of focussing on
individual years, it would be worthwhile for the Bank in such cases
to focus on a utility's performance over a number of years taken
together. It may also be more appropriate to assess a utility's
performance against broad management objectives, setting financial
goals in the context of such broad corporate objectives.
(c)    Greater attention should be given to familiarizing borrowers with
the Bank's procurement procedures in the early stages of project
appraisal.
1/  EDP's comments: "In 1981, even worse drought conditions adversely affected
the financial position, to an extent that requires reformulation of corrective
mechanisms to face this type of events. The matter is being addressed by the
Government and EDP and in being handled under the proposed Seventh Power
Project."

Assunto
Dear Mr Kapur
Thank you very much for your letter of September 23, 1982 and the
Notes:      attached draft report.
The report is a gratifying account of EDP's management and staff
endeavours over the first few years of the company.
We have already offered the Completion Missionour imput to the re
port. However, we would like to take this opportunity to comment the wording of
the introductory paragraph of the conclusions and to add one clarification and
one correction.
Para. 5.4.1              The clarification concerns paragraph 5.4.1: all tariff increases in
has been     clude the effect of fuel price adjustments. The reason for the misleading presen
amended 
tation results from simultaneous decisions regarding changes in fuel prices and
tariff adjust,ents in all cases except in January 1980.
Para. 5.8.1              The energy supplied to distribution networks has decreased from 32.3%
has been     in 1976 to 27.3% in 1980, as a result of integration of municipal distribution ser
amended
vices and different demand growth within EDP's and other distributers areas. The a
verage share of sales to distribution networks is well belo'    the figure mentioned
on paragraph 5.8.1. The 95% relate to EDP's share in generation.
Para. 9.1.1              The qualification of the financial position of EDP, in 1981, as disas
a ended      trous (paragraph 9.1.1.) seems excessive. We believe the following statement to be
more appropriate:

These comments             In 1981, even worse drought conditions adversely affect the financial
have been   position, to an extent that requ.ires reformulation of corrective mechanisms to face
a foot-      this type of events. The matter is being addressed by the Government and EDP and is
