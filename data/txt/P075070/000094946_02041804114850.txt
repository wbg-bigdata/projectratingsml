Amount:                 US$40 million
Description:            The proposed Public Expenditure Reform Loan (PERL)
would support the program of the Government of Mauritius
as articulated in the Economic Agenda for the New
Millennium (NEA) and the accompanying public finance
reform. It will finance specific actions taken by the
Government during budget year 2001/2002. The PERL
would particularly focus on key reforms in education,
training, poverty alleviation, environment and economic
management. Complementary knowledge assistance would
concentrate on human capital development and economic
management.
Benefits:               The loan will assist the Government in implementing and
sustaining its reform program that focuses on transforming
Mauritius into a "high-tech high income service and
knowledge economy" over the medium term.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND
DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED PUBLIC EXPENDITURE REFORM LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MAURITIUS
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a
proposed Public Expenditure Reform Loan to the Republic of Mauritius for US$40
million. The operation is intended to support the program of the Governnent of
Mauritius as articulated in the Economic Agenda for the New Millennium (NEA) and the
accompanying public finance reform.' The NEA aims to alter the development path of
the country and assure Mauritius a place among high-income economies.
I. INTRODUCTION
2.    Mauritius is a strong economic performer. Since 1980, Mauritius has grown at an
average annual rate of 5.5 percent, almost quadrupling its per capita income to US$3,800
and diversifying its economy from sugar to apparel manufacturing, tourism, and more
recently financial services. The success of the Mauritian economy reflects the good
governance and transparency that have been established over the past twenty years in the
country.  Mauritius' development has been based on a stable macroeconomic
environment, a favorable investment climate, strong capitalization of preferential trade
arrangements, and a comprehensive welfare system.
3.    Mauritius is keen to stay on a high growth trajectory which would allow the
country to increase the welfare of its people, especially those that are at risk of falling
behind. The NEA aims to achieve this objective by developing Mauritius into a "high-
tech high income service and knowledge economy" in about five year's time.
4.    The proposed single-tranche Public Expenditure Reform Loan (PERL) aims to
assist the Government in the first year of implementation of the NEA. Policy reforms
under the NEA and complementary public investment concentrate on education, the
environment, the operational framework for the private sector, economic management,
and selected programs for poverty reduction. These activities jointly aim to lay the
foundation for continued growth and increased welfare.
5.    The Government has already taken key actions to implement the NEA. Such
actions concern critical reforms to enhance competitiveness, improve the quality of
education, prevent deterioration of the country's fragile environment, and improve
economic management. These actions underline the commitment to implement the NEA
in a sustainable macroeconomic framework. To assist in the implementation of the NEA,
X The Economic Agenda for the New Millennium was presented to the National Assembly as part of the
Budget Speech for the 2001/02 budget in June 2001.
- 1 -



Government and the Bank have agreed on a work program, consisting of analytical and
advisory services to support policy making in education, public expenditures, social
policy and labor markets.  These services, which would include a joint Public
Expenditure Review, would pave the way for the discussion of a subsequent lending
operation, in the second year of the implementation of the NEA, should financing be
required.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
6.    Mauritius' economy is buoyant. GDP grew strongly in the past two years
(1999/00 and 2000/01) with modem sectors carrying the expansion. Non-sugar GDP
growth averaged about 5.8 percent per annum for the two years 1999/00 and 2000/01.2
Manufacturing growth averaged about 6 percent per annum for both years, while tourism
(hotels and restaurant services) grew at 4 percent and 14 percent in the two years
respectively. Similarly, financial services recorded double digit expansion figures. The
sugar sector, in contrast, has had uneven performance: it contracted by almost 50 percent
in 1999/00 due to a drought and recovered in 2000/01.
7.    The external current account balance improved significantly from  1999/00
(-1.6 percent of GDP) to 2000/01 (1.8 percent of GDP) mirroring sugar export proceeds.
Since October 2000, the Mauritian Rupee has depreciated against the US Dollar, and
since January 2001, it also depreciated against the Euro. Today, foreign exchange
reserves of the Bank of Mauritius are above 3 months of imports. Between 1999/00 to
2000/01, the fiscal deficit has worsened (from -3.8 percent to -6.6 percent of GDP),
largely due to lower tax revenues stemming from the implementation of WTO and
regional trade agreements, and the relatively high level of expenditures maintained to
meet economic and social needs.
8.    Economic performance in 2001/02 is expected to be good. Mauritius' economy is
likely to grow at 5.3 percent, relying on exceptional performance in the sugar (8 percent
growth) and financial sectors (11 percent growth) and good performance of the Export
Processing Zone (5 percent growth). The tourism sector stabilized in the aftermath of the
September 11 events and is likely to close the fiscal year without a contraction. Cyclone
Dina destroyed parts of the cane crop in the northern part of the island in January 2002.
Crop damage is estimated at about 10-15 percent of total sugar output, causing a negative
impact on GDP of at most 0.5 percent, which would materialize in fiscal year 2002/03.
The external current account is expected to remain positive.
9.    The strength of Mauritius' economy in the last two years, as presented in table 1,
reflects the country's development over the past 20 years. During this period, structural
change from the traditional sugar sector towards industry (especially apparel
manufacturing) and services is noted. High investment and growth have gone hand in
2 Total GDP grew at 2.6 percent that in 1999/00 due to a drought, but recovered to 7.2 percent growth in
2000/01. In 2000/01 value added from the sugar sector amounted to 3.5 percent of GDP at factor cost and
accounted for 20 percent of merchandise export earnings.

to GDP ratio) and moderately increasing domestic debt.

10.    Mauritius achieved the structural transformation of its economy by capitalizing on
the preferential trade agreements with the EU in the sugar and textile areas (box 1).
Mauritius was able to take advantage of these opportunities because of its political
stability, sound governance framework, and attractive investment environment. In the
process, Mauritius developed a dual economy, highly open for the export sectors, but
with protected domestic markets. Mauritius maintains a tri-partite approach to economic
and social decision-making (Government-private sector-labor). The approach has helped
to develop a comprehensive welfare system, which is a key instrument in helping make
Mauritians stakeholders in the country's development.

and Roy (2001) Who Can Explain the Mauritian Miracle: Meade, Romer, Sachs or Rodrik? IMF Working
Paper August 2001.

Box 1. Preferential Trade Treatment of Mauritius
Sugar. The EU Sugar Protocol (SP) provides Mauritius with a guaranteed quota for sugar of 507,000
tons annually. The EU-ACP Special Preferential Agreement for Sugar (SPS) (1995) foresees additional
85,000 tons at 85 percent of the SP quota. In addition, the US Sugar Program provides Mauritius with a
quota of 15,000 tons to the US market. Sugar revenues account for approximately 2-4 percent of GDP
per year and about a fifth of merchandise export earnings. Since January 1999 the abolition of the
Green rates for EU currencies and exchange rate fluctuations has led to an 18 percent decline in the
Rupee price for the 2000 sugar harvest. With production costs at 25-50 percent above competitors,
Mauritius will have to adjust. Concurrently, under the Everything But Arms initiative, which granted
duty free and quota free access to 48 least developing countries to EU markets, Mauritius has its SP
quota cut in half for 2001/02; transitional arrangements for sugar under the SP, which are being worked
out, will expire in 2009.
Textiles. Mauritius has also benefited from preferential trade treatment by the EU for its textile exports
under the Lome Convention by which ACP countries are granted duty free and quota free access to the
European markets. Non ACP countries, including Mauritius' competitions in the Far East have been
subjected to tariffs and quotas under the Multi-Fiber Agreement (MFA). The preferential status will
end by December 2004. With unit labor costs in Mauritius 3-4 times higher than those of Asian
competitors Mauritius is facing a significant challenge for its market share and revenues. The US
Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA 2000), which provides for quota-free access to apparel
import from sub-Saharan Africa is likely to mitigate or eliminate the impact of the termination of the
MFA by 2004. The preferential treatment is expected to lead to a 17 percent increase in exports by
2005 and to a 30 percent increase in exports through 2008 when AGOA expires.
11.    Social development has accompanied the economic boom of the past 20 years.
Life expectancy of women increased from 66 years (1971) to 75.3 years (2000); life
expectancy of men from 61 years (1971) to 67 years (2000). Over the last decade,
functional literacy was raised from 80.8 to 85 percent. Impressive reductions in maternal
and infant mortality have been realized, and communicable diseases have been
eliminated. Primary education attendance is universal today.
12.    Although poverty is overall modest, several groups in society are at a higher risk
of being poorer than others, with Rodrigues having a higher concentration of poor than
the rest of the country. Based on the latest available household expenditure survey
(1996/97), it is estimated that about 9.4 percent of the population is poor.4  One parent
families with children are four times more likely to be poor than two parent families.
Similarly, the poverty rate for the elderly living alone is three times as high as those
being able to benefit from living arrangements with extended families.
13.    The recent rise of unemployment is causing increasing concern among policy
makers. From 1990 to 2000, the rate of unemployment (unadjusted) almost doubled,
from 5.6 percent to 9.6 percent. Job creation fell short of the demand for labor especially
as the female participation rate in the labor market increased strongly. In 2000, youth
unemployment rates were extremely high, reaching 40 percent for the age group below
20. In the same year, two-thirds of the unemployed were younger than 25, first-time job

median monthly equivalized per capita income.

seekers, and without technical or vocational training. These young Mauritians have been
at considerable risk of being left behind in a more and more prosperous society.

14.   Poverty and unemployment are intrinsically linked to education. While Mauritius
has achieved universal primary school attendance, drop out and failure rates are high.
There are also significant failure rates linked to the selective and competitive completion
examinations at the pimary school level and after the first cycle of secondary school. Of
the total adult population roughly about a third have failed or have not even taken the
primary school exam, indicating the need for upgrading the basic professional skills of
the labor force. About 60 percent of Mauritius' 12-19 year age group are enrolled in
secondary schools and colleges; however, more than one third of those starting secondary
education fail to pass the exams. The majority of these failures are among students from
lower income households. An analysis of poverty shows that the largest part of poverty
risks are explained by the educational background of the household head rather than
household structure or geographical location. Similarly, evidence shows that students
failing in secondary school examinations are more than thirty percent more likely to
become unemployed than students successfully completing the cycle.
III. AN ECONOMIC AGENDA FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM (NEA)
15.   The Government designed the NEA (June 2001) to achieve high and inclusive
economic growth while addressing the economic and social challenges the country faces.
Mauritius is aiming to become a "high-tech high income service and knowledge
economy" in about five years time. To achieve the country's development objectives, the
NEA encompasses reforms to:
(i)     improve the competitiveness of Mauritius' private sector,
(ii)    invest in people and society, including in poverty alleviation,
(iii)   preserve and protect Mauritius' fragile environment;
(iv)    modernize the country's economic management.
-5-



The NEA accompanied the budget for 2001/2002 which prioritizes capital expenditures
in line with the above objectives. The budget is anchored in a stable macro-economic
framework, ensuring sustainable deficits and debt paths in the next years.
A. Improving the Competitiveness of Mauritius' Private Sector
Objectives and Strategies
16.   The NEA aims to increase economic efficiency by (i) streamlining incentives and
improving the operational framework for the private sector, (ii) improving the
functioning of factor markets, (iii) rendering the markets for utilities more competitive
and improving transportation infrastructure; and (iv) engaging in structural reforms in
specific sectors. In doing so, Mauritius is seeking to gradually reduce the segmentation
of its economy and increase its competitiveness in world markets.
17.   Streamlining of incentives and improving the operational framework for the
private sector. Mauritius has long maintained differential corporate tax rates, and
differential customs duties on raw materials and intermediate inputs, for the export and
domestic sectors. In addition, Mauritius has attracted offshore companies by offering an
attractive tax regime. The NEA foresees a comprehensive reform of the regulatory
framework to rationalize and consolidate the regulations for onshore and offshore
companies.
18.   Improving the functioning offactor markets. Mauritius is seeking to introduce
greater flexibility in the labor market and to assist the private sector to better respond to
market needs within the framework of the existing tripartite wage negotiation
mechanism. To increase mobility, a review and reform of the rigid wage structure (which
determines wages by function and sector) is planned.  Financial sector reform
encompasses designing a regulatory structure for the non-banking financial sector, and
strengthening supervision in banking and the stock exchange. The NEA also aims to
gradually improve the functioning of the land market by lowering restrictions on the
alternative use of cane land.
19.   Rendering  the  markets for utilities more  competitive  and  improving
transportation infrastructure. The Government aims to reduce communications costs
(and connectivity fees) and to improve effectiveness of the public transportation
infrastructure. This would be accomplished by seeking strategic partnerships for
Mauritius parastatal enterprises.
20.   Engaging in sectoral reforms. The NEA includes important reforms for the
country's traditional economic sectors as well as for information technology, a new
sector under development. These reforms aim to (i) reduce production costs of sugar; (ii)
provide incentives for agricultural diversification; (iii) increase value added of the textile
sector by vertically integrating and specializing in higher value added activities, while
moving overseas the lower value added activities; (iv) further increase expenditures per
tourist. In the near future, a fiber optic cable will link Mauritius to Asia, Southem Africa,
- 6-



and Europe. This would provide the bilingual country - with its time-zone location
between Europe and Asia - an entry into the expanding information technology market.
Program Actions in 2001/02
21.    In the first year of implementation of the NEA, Government has taken actions to
improve the competitiveness of the economy. Regarding the incentives framework,
Government has (i) established a uniform tariff rate for intermediate inputs for almost all
sectors; (ii) reduced the import-weighted average tariff from 32 percent to about
12 percent (at substantial fiscal cost)5; (iii) implemented the Companies Act (May 2001;
effective December 2001) which addresses registration, incorporation, issuance of shares
and debentures, responsibilities of directors, and similar issues for all economic sectors;
(iv) set up a Committee on Corporate Governance to ensure that financial and equity
markets function efficiently. 6 In parallel, the private sector's representative body, the
Joint Economic Council, drafted a Code of Conduct for private sector operators.
22.    Government has undertaken a number of financial sector reforms. The Financial
Services Development Act (May 2001) has been enacted, allowing for the creation of a
non-banking financial sector regulator (eventually under the Bank of Mauritius) covering
insurance, stock market, securities insurance, and pensions. A Financial Services
Commission has been established and is operational since December 2001 to oversee the
implementation of the Act. A Trusts Act (to ease asset management), a Financial
Intelligence and Anti-Money Laundering Act, and a Prevention of Corruption Act have
also been passed. The strength of the banking sector is underlined by a relatively low
share of non-performing loans in bank portfolios (9 percent).
23.    In the area of utilities and infrastructure, Mauritius has (i) adjusted the domestic
prices for petroleum products to reflect world market levels in order to reduce the
financial losses of the State Trading Corporation; (ii) significantly increased the
electricity tariffs to reduce the financial deficit of the Central Electricity Board,
(iii) passed the Freeport Act (July 2001) which clarifies the role of Mauritius Freeport
Authority as the regulator of freeport activities, whereas all commercial activities are left
with independent operators and developers. The telecommunications market is expected
to be fully liberalized by December 2003 (40 percent of Mauritius Telecom was sold to
France Telecom in November 2000).
24.    Two fundamental sectoral reforms are ongoing in the current program year. First,
Mauritius has undertaken a fundamental restructuring of the sugar sector. The Sugar
5 The simple average of Mauritius' customs tariff rates on imports from scheduled territories was 19.4
percent for 2000 compared to 29 percent for 1994. The WTO estimates that the simple average of
Mauritius' MFN tariff for 2000/01 was 19.9 percent. For 2000/01, 55 percent of the 5,499 tariff lines were
zero-rates compared to 28 percent in July 1999. Source: Mauritius Trade Policy Review Report by the
WTO Secretariat, November 2001.
6 In cooperation with UNCTAD, Mauritius is currently undertaking a review of its fiscal incentives regimes
(report expected in the second half of 2002) The review is expected to cover the multiple incentive regimes
applying to the real sector (including EPZ and information technology) and to the financial sector
(including off-shore activities).
-7-



Sector Strategic Plan (SSSP, September 2001) entails early voluntary retirement of
employees (8,000 or about one quarter of the sugar sector labor force) and the conversion
of sugar land for alternative uses (land will be given to the government and beneficiaries
of the voluntary retirement scheme). A five-year Rs. 2 billion loan from Bank of
Mauritius via commercial banks to the private sector will help smooth transition costs.
Some smaller (less efficient) sugar plants are to be closed and processing will be
centralized in larger establishments.
25.   Second, Government has created Business Parks of Mauritius Limited (BPML) as
a parastatal entity to develop the information technology sector. BPML is promoting
Mauritius as a bi-lingual location (providing Asian firms with access to francophone
markets) and benefiting from a time zone in between the US and Asia. A seed loan has
been obtained from the government of India in the amount of US$100 million.
Construction of the business park is expected to begin in May 2002, on cane land recently
converted via the Sugar Sector Strategic Plan. The CyberCity will contain its own
independent satellite link. BPML is expected to be financially independent in two years'
time.
B. Investing in People and Society
Objectives and Strategies
26.   Mauritius has succeeded in increasing the longevity of its population by 10 years
since the late 1970s and eliminated communicable diseases. It has also achieved
universal primary education. Mauritius has accomplished these gains by raising
employment and wages, as well as by establishing a comprehensive welfare system.
27.   The welfare system provides free education, free health care, a universal pension
to everybody over 60, assistance to families with special needs, low cost housing,
subsidies for rice and flour, social aid transfers, and entails several large micro-finance
projects. The system is however costly -it absorbed about 12 percent of GDP last year,
or almost half of recurrent expenditures- and requires substantial reforms as it has:
(i) Not been able to significantly raise education levels, leading to a poorly equipped
work force. A key problem is the elitist nature of the education system, which
results in 20 to 25 percent of each cohort - especially those from weaker income
groups - dropping out without adequate remedial schooling or vocational training,
resulting in inadequate education for labor market entrants. The existing system is
highly centralized, with students from all over the country competing for positions
in selected secondary schools. It is inefficient as it encourages private after-hours
tutoring to increase chances to pass classes and exams, and also to enter the best
secondary schools. Partially due to the overly selective secondary school system,
tertiary enrolment is low.
(ii) Not met the changing demands of the population in health. These demands focus
on the delivery of sophisticated tertiary health care such as cardiac and vascular
- 8 -



surgery, renal dialysis, diabetes complications treatment, etc. At the same time, the
health system has to cope with an increasing demand for general health services
partly due to increasing living standards and an aging population, but also triggered
by the "free-of-charge" policy.
(iii) Not been able to contain costs of the basic pension. Mauritius has a three-tier
pension system, with the basic pension designed as a non-contributory and
universal pension, available to all Mauritians over 60. Costs of the scheme are
mounting and projections show that the system would absorb twice its current share
of GDP in 20 years and triple in 40 years.7 While the basic pension has succeeded
in reducing old-age poverty, it still leaves a sizable portion of elderly households
(about 30 percent) in poverty. In order to sustain costs, the Government will be
required to rethink the universality of the basic pension.
(iv) Been unable to effectively protect the most vulnerable in society. A wide variety of
social assistance programs exist; including rice and flour subsidies, micro-credit
schemes, and income support for individuals with special needs (ranging from
spectacle subsidies to targeted income support for single, non-working mothers).
Mauritius also maintains two large anti-poverty housing programs for low and very
low income households. Little is known about the effectiveness of these welfare
programs and about their contribution to poverty alleviation. Most of the programs
are very small and have a low coverage of the target population.
28.   Education sector reform  and investment are the backbone of the NEA.
Government has committed Mauritius to compulsory 1 -year education. Over the next
few years, Mauritius aims to (i) raise educational attainment, (ii) narrow the existing
educational gap to Mauritius' international competitors, (iii) provide greater opportunities
for the poor with easier access to education, and (iv) improve its vocational and training
system to equip and maintain an agile labor force. In vocational training, Mauritius aims
to increase responsiveness of training to the private sector and also clarify regulator and
provider issues.
29.   In the health sector the NEA aims to raise private sector participation in health
provision as a means to ensuring quality services while assuring sustainability. Although
the HIV prevalence rate is very low, Mauritius is designing a national AIDS awareness
campaign as part of a national multi-sector strategy.
30.   The Government intends to modernize the pension system. Based on analytical
work conducted with the Bank, it aims to (i) contain the fiscal cost of the basic pension,
(ii) increase the returns to assets of the contributory scheme and thereby increase pension
benefits to contributors at retirement, and (iii) establish a regulatory and supervisory
framework for occupational schemes and voluntary individual provision. This would
include the development of a financially viable pension system with adequate care for the
poor and room for voluntary provision.
7Mauritius spent 3.5 percent of its GDP on the basic pension in 2000/01.
-9-



31.   To help those in need, Government intends to consolidate the existing social
assistance programs. Government is planning to adopt a more targeted approach to social
support which would move away from the categorical classifications and make access to
social programs based on need.  As a first step Government will conduct a
comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of existing programs.
The Program for 2001/02
32.   Government has decided to reform the education system as outlined under the
NEA. The most important policy decision has been the extension of the compulsory
education from 6 to 11 years of schooling (to be fully implemented by 2005), which
paves the way for a comprehensive adjustment of the education system. Government has
also provided the necessary budgetary resources to meet program needs. Actions that
have been launched include (i) the revision of the curriculum at the primary level (ii) the
construction of 6 new secondary schools (out of 16 planned), the design of tenders for
equipment of 354 computer laboratories in primary schools, and the extension of
infrastructures and facilities for the tertiary education, and (iii) the recruitment of
additional 730 teachers (of which 330 for ICT) for implementing the education reform
program.
33.   Additional activities are currently underway and include: (i) introduction of an
early detection system to identify poor performers at an early stage with remedial
assistance, (ii) change of the end-of-primary exam (CPE) to allow higher opportunities to
enroll to secondary school level, (iii) provision of reading rooms, (iv) replacement of the
existing centralized star-school system for secondary education by a regionalized one
(5 regions for the country) for the first 5 years of secondary education, (v) pre-vocational
training for the secondary level early drop-outs to prepare them better for the labor
market, and (vi) extension of the University of Technology of Mauritius (UTM) to help
transform Mauritius into a regional information and communication technology hub.
34.   In the health sector, a High Level Task Force has produced a draft strategy and
action plan based on initial work supported by a PHRD grant. The strategy proposes to
maintain free health care for basic services while using health insurance for tertiary care
and emergency services. Increase in medical staff and in provision of medicine,
construction of a new hospital and modernization of existing infrastructure and
equipment as well as institutional reforms complement the plan.
35.   Regarding social assistance and poverty reduction programs, Mauritius launched
a broad consultative process and developed an Action Plan for Poverty Alleviation
(completed July 2001). A very important action to be taken is the in-depth review of the
poverty impact and efficiency of the 10 largest welfare programs. The plan also entails
several components, including: (i) micro-credit schemes, (ii) very low income housing,
(iii) improved access to education for the poor (free transport and food in some deprived
areas to encourage children to go to school), and (iv) an extensive public investment
program in Rodrigues.

C. Preserving Mauritius' Fragile Environment
Objectives and Strategies
36.    Mauritius' economic development has significant consequences for the country's
limited natural resources. Under the assumptions of continued economic growth
stemming from the sugar sector (including development of high grade sugar), textiles
(including moving to higher value added production), tourism and continued double digit
growth of the remaining service sectors (financial and trade) environmental pressures are
expected to grow significantly on land and soils, water and the coastal zone. Table 3, an
excerpt from the National Environmental Strategies (NES, 1999) which proposes an
action plan for the environment until 2010, presents an overview of the environrnental
resources under pressure for the island of Mauritius. For Rodrigues, agriculture and
fishing will put a heavy burden on land, soils, and the coastal zones.
37.    To address these issues, the Government is building on the NES-proposed three-
pronged approach:
*  On the erconomic side, Government is considering to (i) phase out fertilizer
subsidies in agriculture, (ii) introduce cost recovery for environmental
services, electricity, and water, (iii) review pricing of leases of land in the Pas
Geometrique, and to (iv) use taxes and allowances to support environmental
goals.
*  On the institutional side, Government will improve compliance with
environmental legislation through voluntary agreements and incentives as well
as through fines and penalties.
*  On the information management side, to raise awareness Government
considers it critical to improve public disclosure of information on the state of
the environment.

38.   The NEA prioritizes Government's actions in three key sectors: management of
solid waste, management of liquid waste and transportation:
* Solid waste management: Government strategy focuses on maximizing the value
from waste and minimizing waste production. Private sector involvement by
partially contracting out collection, transfer, and disposal operations will be
extended to other areas of solid waste management. Government will also
modernize the institutional framework for the entire logistical chain (storage,
collection, transfer, and disposal) and the structure of the cost recovery
mechanisms. To achieve this objective an Integrated Solid Waste Management
Program has been prepared.
*  Liquid waste management: Because of the threat posed by the use of soakage pits
(80 percent of households are not connected to sewerage networks) to the
underground water supply, the lagoon, and the marine environment, Government
is proceeding with the rapid implementation of the National Sewerage Master
Plan (NSMP). As part of a Sector Policy Letter (1998) Government will invest in
wastewater laboratory facilities to enforce environmental standards, implement a
phased revision of waste water tariffs based on metered water consumption, and
ensure economic and financial sustainability of the sector through a country-wide
connection program. The Wastewater Authority has been converted into a
parastatal under the Wastewater Management Authority Act 2000.  It is
anticipated that - in accordance with the "Polluter Pays" principle - a Waste
Water Surcharge Tax will be levied on industries over and above the monthly
waste water tariff, in case of non-compliance with the waste water standards
under the Environment Protection Act.
. Transportation: Mauritius has an ambitious programme of developing the
transport infrastructures of the country. A Transport Master Plan has been
established that addresses issues of reduction of congestion, improvement of
public transport, development of safety and minimization of costs. On the air
transport, the objective is to extend airport capacity (in terms of passengers and
freight) and turn Plaisance into a world-class airport. The Government is
preparing an Air Transport Master Plan that will include the upgrade of the
infrastructures and facilities, air traffic safety and consolidation of air routes.
Finally, on the port side, Port-Louis is expecting to become a major center for
trade. In this objective, the Port Master Plan will be updated and new
infrastructures and activities will be identified. Productivity and efficiency are
primarily sought with the identification of an international Strategic Alliance for
Cargo Handling Corporation.
Program Actions for 2001/02
39.   In the areas of environment and transport the program for the year 2001/02
focuses on: (i) extending water distribution networks, (ii) initiating action for an
incinerator plant for the treatment of solid waste -expected to be operational in 2005/06,
- 12-



(iii) speeding up the construction of sewerage treatment plants, (iv) connecting
households to the sewage network, (v) improving the road network, and (vi) on seeking a
strategic alliance for Cargo Handling Corporation Ltd (CHCL). The Government also
created an Environmental Police to monitor emission of pollutants.
40.    To address the environmental problems on Rodrigues the Government aims to
foster economic development for the island. The most significant feature in this context is
the extensive public works program included in the present budget, which is expected to
raise incomes as well as to reduce over-fishing of the lagoon and deforestation.
D. Improving Economic Management8
Objectives and Strategies
41.    The improvement of economic management has been a key element of the
Government's strategy. Activities have so far focused on (i) designing and implementing
fiscal and monetary policies, (ii) retaining sound budgetary control, and (iii) improving
public procurement regulations, practices and fiduciary controls. The NEA aims to
further enhance the quality and effectiveness of public expenditures to meet the needs of
an increasingly sophisticated economy and to balance mounting fiscal pressures due to
high expenditure needs. To achieve this, the NEA seeks to adopt a comprehensive
approach to the role of Government in view of redefining the relationship between the
public and the private sector as well as adjusting the institutional and procedural
dimensions of government operations. In this context, Mauritius will need to refocus its
civil service on improved service delivery to facilitate the development of an
internationally competitive economy. Mauritius will also take a critical look at fiscal
vulnerabilities, to minimize risk to its macroeconomic stability and assure a stable
environment for the development of the financial sector. 9
42.    The NEA has set course to modernize economic management and introduce
second generation reforms. These will include a gradual change in the role of the public
sector with greater emphasis on interaction among economic and social partners in
important public policy decisions and on cost-efficiency centered decision-making. The
Government intends to link expenditures to strategic objectives and monitor the impact of
public expenditures. It will also develop and adopt a strategy to minimize fiscal
vulnerability that includes the following elements:
* Consolidated government accounts will be published and will include the various
extra-budgetary operations;
* Off-budgets funds associated with the Privatization Fund will be ceased;
8 Policy aspects of economic management, particularly related to the incentive structures in the economy,
were discussed in Section III.A. This section addresses institutional aspects of economic management.
9 This will include central government debt (which stood at about 51 percent of GDP at end June 2001),
parastatal debt guaranteed by the central government about 9 percent of GDP at end June 2001), extra-
budgetary funds, pressures on social protection system (pensions in particular), directed credits (to the EPZ
and the sugar sector), and tax expenditures.
- 13 -



*  Oversight and accountability of parastatals and other public bodies will be
strengthened;
* The system for procuring goods, works and services will be strengthened to
enhance economy, efficiency and transparency;
* A Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) will be developed; and
* Estimate of tax expenditures will be published to inform the population about the
cost of tax concessions and exemptions.
Program Actions for 2001/02
43.   Upon taking office, the Government focused on the following key areas: first, it
adjusted the retail prices of petroleum products and electricity to avert losses of the State
Trading Corporation and the Central Electricity Board. The 25-50 percent rise in
petroleum prices sent an important signal about the future course of pricing policies.
Second, under the Finance Act 2001, the VAT was increased from 10 tol2 percent.
Third, off-budgets funds associated with the Privatization Fund were integrated into the
annual budget. The Government also strengthened the management of the customs and
excise department and has established a unit for large taxpayers. All these measures are
expected to increase revenues by 1 percent of GDP in the 2001/02 budget and offset the
revenue loses from WTO and other regional commitments in the same year.
44.   Government has also focused on ensuring a stable macroeconomic enviromnent.
A key element in this context is the decision to adopt a Medium Term Expenditure
Framework. A High Level Committee (HLC), headed by the Financial Secretary of the
Ministry of Finance, has been established which consists of all relevant stakeholders
including the potential pilot ministries. The objective of the HLC is to design the scope of
a MTEF for Mauritius. An action plan and timetable for piloting the MTEF is under
preparation.  To better coordinate and strengthen macroeconomic activities the
Government has established a Macroeconomic Coordinating Committee and a Debt
Management Unit in the Ministry of Finance.
45.   Government has also initiated a review of the parastatal sector and is working in
conjunction with the World Bank on a comprehensive assessment of fiscal risks. This
analysis will constitute a first step to develop an adequate risk management strategy
which includes improved monitoring, evaluation and future mitigation of fiscal risks.
E. The First Budget Under the NEA: 2001/2002
46.   The first budget to implement the NEA has allocated 25.2 percent of GDP to
central government expenditures for 2001/02, compared to 24.3 percent of GDP spent in
2000/01. This represents an expected increase of 0.9 percent of GDP over the previous
year's expenditures. In order to meet the wide range of reform objectives under the
NEA, the higher budget envelope was also reprioritized relative to the previous year's
expenditures.  This resulted in increased allocations for four strategic priorities:
education, the environment, infrastructure and poverty reduction programs.
- 14-



47.    Table 4 illustrates the priorities of the incremental allocation and confirms a
gradual shift in overall expenditure priorities of the 2001/02 budget. The shift in
functional priorities towards the social sectors entails a move towards more capital
expenditures. The table indicates that of the 0.9 percent of GDP increase in expenditures,
1.9 percent of GDP (i.e. almost 200 percent of the increase) is allocated to community
and social affairs while 1.0 percent of GDP was allocated away from other sectors. From
a functional perspective there has been a 1.3 percent of GDP increase in the capital
budget, as shown in the last column of table 4 below. This implies a reduction of the
recurrent expenditures of 0.4 percent of GDP.

F. Subsequent Budgets adClnd  :i_  Li r-'.-:! , >Fj9E
48.    The significant investments identified in the NEA raise questions about the fiscal
sustainability of the expenditure program and Mauritius' ability to maintain its
creditworthiness. The total costs of the NEA were estimated at Rs. 50 billion, to be
undertaken from 2001/02 through 2005/06; the total costs amount to about 40 percent of
GDP of 2000/01. To maintain macroeconomic stability, Government has decided to
prioritize and sequence the implementation of the NEA. It is currently anticipating to
spend about Rs. 40 billion between 2001/02 and 2005/06 in capital investments (an
average annual capital expenditure 80 percent higher than in 2000/01), while allowing
Rs. 10 billion to be implemented after 2005/06. Governent's continued commitment to
fiscal discipline and its capacity to further prioritize public expenditures and to raise
additional revenues are key factors in maintaining macroeconomic stability under the
current positive economic environment and in the event of a economic downturn.
- 15 -



Specifically, Government is expected to maintain a higher rate of implementation of the
NEA during high-growth and high revenue years relative to lower growth and lower
revenue years that could occur under a potential downturn.
49.   Short and medium term growth projections. In the short to medium term,
Mauritius expects to maintain its strong economic performance with continued efforts to
modernize, innovate and increase value added per worker. The sources of growth are
expected to remain as today, i.e. sugar, textiles, tourism, and financial services, with the
possible addition of information technology services. Drastic steps have already been
taken to improve productivity in the sugar sector, so the sector is likely to stay healthy.
The textile sector is expected to continue to grow as the preferential trade agreement
(MFA) will not be phased out till 2008. It is also anticipated that Mauritius' exports to
the US will gain importance enough to sustain the growth rate of the sector to about 5
percent. Tourism is expected to continue to perform well in the coming years. On the
basis of the confidence generated by the new regulatory framework the financial sector is
expected to continue its double-digit growth rates. With the establishment of a fiber optic
infrastructure over the next year and the liberalization of the telecommunications market
by the end of 2003 the ICT sector is projected to significantly gain economic importance.
This scenario is presented in table 5.
50.   Fiscal policy. Government is committed to implement the NEA in a sustainable
macroeconomic framework. Table 5 presents a gradual and conservative assessment of
the pace of deficit reduction given the Government's public commitment to reduce the
central government deficit to about 3 percent of GDP by 2005/06.  In the short term,
government aims to .ol1solidate parts of recurrent expenditure, to keep total expenditures
at about 25 percent of GDP. In the outer years, Mauritius aims to reduce pension
expenditures and limit debt accumulation (and debt service) for highly prioritized
investment needs. Capital expenditures under the NEA come to about 4-5 percent of
GDP over the next 5 years, for the aforementioned Rs. 40 billion priority package.
51.   To help meet its deficit targets, Government aims to undertake a significant
revenue enhancement effort. There are several possibilities for raising revenues. The tax
effort is now 15.6 percent of GDP (2001/2002), still among the lowest in upper middle
income countries and there appears to be substantial room for raising taxes without
affecting the competitiveness of the economy. Under the prospect of revenue losses due
to regional trade commitments, Government is planning to broaden the tax base for
import duties by reducing exemptions and improving tax administration (strengthening
collection, audit and reporting to revenue departments). As stated above, VAT rates have
already been raised from 10 to 12 percent and a further increase of indirect taxes could be
contemplated. On direct taxation, the Government can limit exemptions as most
corporate taxpayers are effectively paying 15 percent, compared to the statutory rate of
25 percent. Similarly, Government can incorporate most individuals into the tax scheme,
as they are currently left outside it. Table 5 indicates that by 2005/06 Mauritius expects
net increases in revenues of about 2.2 percent of GDP compared to the 2001/02 rates.
- 16-



52.    Given the current macroeconomic outlook, the central government debt path is
sustainable. The base line scenario presented table 5 includes a significantly improved
revenue effort which would finance an increase, in real terms, of central government
capital expenditures while reducing the overall fiscal deficit gradually to about 3.5
percent of GDP by 2005/06. Under this scenario, central Government debt would be
expected to peak at about 53.7 percent of GDP in 2003/04. As illustrated in chart 1, the
debt/GDP ratio would decline thereafter, implying the sustainability of the borrowing
strategy of the Government.10 Consequently, the implementation of NEA is expected to
result in only a temporary increase in indebtedness. Similarly, central government debt
service as share of government revenues would show a small increase till 2004/05 to
about 23 percent, and decline thereafter.
53.    A sensitivity analysis of the NEA program      shows that the debt level is also
sustainable in the event of lower domestic growth rates. Chart 2 presents a low-growth
deficit-reduction scenario, in which the economy's growth rate drops to about 3.5 percent
by the middle of the projection horizon and stays at such low level thereafter. If
Government follows its deficit reduction strategy as well as planned revenue effort (as
share of GDP), the debt/GDP ratio would peak on in 2005/2006 but decline thereafter.
Chart 2 also visualizes the impact of such lower growth rates on public investment: with
tax revenues lower and deficit targets to be met, real capital expenditures would have to
decline quite strongly after 2003/2004 - which would necessitate a stringent prioritization
of expenditures."I

Note: (a) New net fiscal effort is defined from the 2001/02 budget henceforth.
10 This scenario assumes real interest rates at about 4 to 5 percent. Given that 90 percent of government
debt has maturity less than two years and interest rates are globally expected to rise, a sensitivity analysis
on the interest rate was undertaken. The interest rate in the aforementioned scenario was increased by 1-2
percent in the outer years. The analysis suggests that the peak government debt to GDP ratio is expected to
be displaced by 2 years and reach 55.1 percent in the event the capital expenditures under the NEA are
implemented as planned.
" The simulations also confirm the importance of Government maintaining the planned reduction in the
fiscal deficit. Should the growth rate drop and/or revenues and expenditures not be adjusted, the overall
central government debt to GDP ratio would continue to rise throughout the forecast period.

54.   Fiscal vulnerability. The task of reducing the central government fiscal deficit
can become more difficult as Government seeks to reduce fiscal vulnerability by
explicitly recognizing and incorporating into the budget fiscal obligations and risks to
assets and revenues. A first step was the inclusion of various off-budget funds in the
budget for 2001/02, which contributed to increasing the adjusted 2000/01 deficit by
2-3 percent of GDP, and brought it to 6.5 percent of GDP. To assure the sustainability
of the current reform program the Govermnent has begun to (i) compile a consolidated
fiscal deficit, which includes central government and the three largest parastatals, and to
(ii) address the exposure of parastatals. In addition, with World Bank assistance,
technical work on pensions has been initiated. External parastatal debt at the end of June
2001 stood at about 14.5 percent of GDP. The risks associated with this debt, and other
contingent liabilities of GOM, will be addressed in forthcoming analytical work.
IV. THE PROPOSED OPERATION
A. The new Country Assistance Strategy
55.   The proposed operation is the cornerstone of the new Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS). In view of Mauritius' steadfast commitment to modernizing its economy and its
demonstrated capacity to implement a development agenda, the new CAS proposes a
paradigm shift: moving away from project assistance (with embedded technical
assistance) and piecemeal analytical work towards (i) supporting Mauritius' overall
government reform program under sequential umbrella lending operations and (ii)
development of a complementary program of knowledge assistance.
56.   The lending operations would assist the Government to implement its NEA.
Under the new CAS, Bank financing would take the place of other non-project financing
sources and would be linked to achievements that are considered critical for the success
of Mauritius' reform program, in particular in the areas of education, environment, and
economic management.
- 18 -



57.   The parallel knowledge assistance would be provided on the basis of (i) a pre-
determined three-year program of formal analytical work and (ii) punctual strategic
advice and feedback as the need arises. The knowledge assistance program will support
the implementation of priority reforms and will focus on two themes: (i) human capital
development and (ii) economic management.
58.   The new CAS proposes a maximum of one umbrella operation per year of
approximately US$40 million for the three-year CAS period, with an envelope of
approximately US$120 million. The CAS envisages the preparation of a series of
subsequent operations as the Government proceeds with the implementation of its
reforms and as the financing need arises. The (up to three) operations intend to finance
specific actions taken by the Government in the implementation of its NEA.
B. The Proposed Operation
59.   The present operation supports the program of the Government as articulated in
the NEA, and in particular reforms in education, training, environment, infrastructure,
and economic management. The program period covers the second half of 2000 through
the budget year 2001/02.
Objective
60.   The overall aim of this operation is to support Government's reform program
which aims to maintain the country's growth performance and improve welfare in an
inclusive way. The program intends to facilitate the transition of Mauritius into a high-
income high-tech service economy in the next 5 years by strengthening the private sector,
investing in people, protecting the environment, and modernizing economic management.
Areas of focus
61.   Bank support is linked to specific achievements in selected areas which are
specified in table 6 below. These areas are a subset of the detailed NEA reform agenda
presented in schedule 2 which is attached to this document. Table 6 summarizes planned
and intended achievements in these key areas prior to and beyond Board presentation. It
also identifies the strategic goal and objectives for the interventions in these areas.

62.   Education and training:  To implement the NEA Mauritius will need to
comprehensively reform its current education and training sector to produce a better
educated workforce. The current system is inflexible, characterized by inequity and
mainly focused on the CPE examination.'2 Curricula at primary and secondary levels are
outdated  and overloaded.  Similarly, institutional, regulatory  and procedural
arrangements need to be adjusted to create an enabling environment for the delivery of
services and to meet the expectations of the private and the public sectors. Education and
training reform will require a broad political, economic and social consensus among the
relevant stakeholders. The relevant sector ministries will need to (i) improve budgeting
and financing practices to allow the development of sustainable budget projections,
(ii) improve accountability at central and regional levels, (iii) adopt better monitoring and
evaluation practices (including improvement of the examination and assessment system),
and (iv) improve the learning and teaching process by modernizing and streamlining the
curricula, introducing ICT at primary and secondary levels, and by providing better
teacher training and assessment. Initial actions have focused on (i) extending the
compulsory education from 6 to 11 years of schooling scheduled for full implementation
by 2005, to allow for the completion of school construction and capacity building
activities, and (ii) allocating adequate resources for the intended reform of the education
sector in the budget law 2001/2002. Subseguent reforms would focus on revising the
assessment and the examination system to improve equity, on developing a medium-term
cost and financing plan (based on the ongoing education finance study), on modernizing
curricula and on developing programs to address the problems of low performance
schools as well as the education and training needs of the poor.
63.   Poverty alleviation: Key objective in this area is to improve social cohesion in
line with the Action Plan for Poverty Alleviation which provides strategic direction for
Mauritius' poverty reduction efforts. This will include a comprehensive review and
consolidation of all social assistance programs. In the short run three programs for
poverty reduction will be implemented which focus on (i) very low income housing,
(ii) micro-credit schemes, and (iii) Rodrigues. The activities for Rodrigues include: two
water desalination plants for the island as well as the improvement of storage and
distribution facilities. To promote development, the airport of Rodrigues will be
extended to accommodate international flights. Complementary activity will focus on
moving towards a budget system which would allow to adequately assess impact of
social assistance programs. Initial actions have concentrated on the completion of the
Action Plan for Poverty Alleviation and on ensuring sufficient budgetary allocations for
Rodrigues.  Subseguent reforms would focus in particular on the review  and
consolidation of existing welfare and social assistance programs and would implement a
program to address the social needs of the deprived regions.
64.   Environment and transport: In this area the ultimate objective is to put in place a
sustainable financial, institutional and legal framework for the liquid waste, solid waste
and transport sector that meets relevant environmental standards. Activities focus on the
preservation of the environment, in particular on (i) the implementation of the overall
12 The CPE examn is taken at the end of primary school, and has in the past served as a ranking instrument,
allocating students to few slots in a limited number of secondary schools.

solid waste management program (including construction of a 150,000 t/year incinerator
as a private sector initiative), the extension of the existing landfill at Mare Chicose and
the development of new landfill sites, the improvement of the collection and transfer of
waste, the necessary institutional and regulatory adjustments, and the implementation of a
cost recovery system and tariffs for the overall financial sustainability of the sector;
(ii) successful completion of implementation of the ongoing National Sewerage Program
(NSP) which would include further refining of the financing plan and launching of the
connection program (estimated at about $150 million over the coming six years),
implementation of the Government's Sector Policy Letter especially with, regard to cost
recovery system, progressive tariffs and industrial wastewater treatment standards;
(iii) implementation of the National Integrated Transport Strategy with regard to different
modes of transport, completing additional studies required for the selection of the
alternative mode of transport for mass transit on the Curepipe-Port Louis corridor (to
relief traffic congestion in Port Louis and other major cities, solve pollution and
environmental problems in these cities, and contribute to increase productivity through
travel time saving and reducing stress).  Initial actions have focused on (i) the
Parliamentary enactment of the Wastewater Management Authority Act, (ii) the revision
of wastewater tariffs, and (iii) the tendering process for the concept for the alternative
mode of transport for the Port Louis-Curepipe corridor. Subseguent reforms would
concentrate on (i) progressively increasing wastewater tariffs in line with consumption
levels, (ii) implementing the recommendations of the solid waste feasibility study, and on
(iii) implementing a national connection program in line with the National Sewerage
Program.
65.   Economic management: In the areas of economic management the ultimate
objectives are to (i) comprehensively overhaul the existing budget planning and
expenditure management of the Government, (ii) rationalize the fiscal incentive regime
and (iii) liberalize the telecom sector. The reforms are likely to assist Government in
linking and prioritizing public expenditures according to strategic priorities. To improve
transparency of Government activities and the delivery of public services the reforms
would also establish adequate institutional and procedural mechanisms to assess the
impact of public expenditures. A new procurement legislation would complement these
reforms. Other reform activities would focus on the sustainability of the NEA, in
particular on revenue generation and the assessment of fiscal risks. The existing fiscal
incentive regime would be reviewed and consolidated to improve competitiveness and
reduce economic distortions. Initial actions have focused on (i) establishing a committee
to oversee the development and introduction of a Medium Term Expenditure Framework
for Mauritius, (ii) raising VAT from 10% to 12%, and on (iii) adjusting domestic
petroleum prices. Subseguent reforms would concentrate on (i) presenting together with
the annual budget a medium-term macroeconomic framework, (ii) developing an action
plan for the introduction of the MTEF with subsequent development of strategic
objectives and 3-year budgets for 5 pilot ministries, (iii) rationalizing the fiscal incentive
regime, (iv) developing a strategy to contain the contingent liabilities of the Government,
(v) liberalizing the telecom sector to further improve competitiveness, and on
(vi) enacting a new procurement legislation.

Complementars Knowledge Assistance
66.   To assist Government in achieving its key objectives the lending operation is
being complemented by knowledge assistance in critical areas. The Bank has been
providing advice to (i) reform budget and expenditure management, in particular to
develop a medium term expenditure framework and to review the public procurement
system, (ii) implement education sector reforms, (iii) design reforms in liquid waste
management (iv) reform the pension system (ESW), and to (v) reorient the welfare state.
It is anticipated to continue to provide knowledge assistance in critical areas, in particular
economic management and human capital development. Specifically, the Government
and the Bank plan to conduct joint reviews of public expenditures and the labor market.
Disbursement of the operation
67.   The loan would be disbursed in a single tranche, to be released after the
effectiveness of the loan agreement and prior to the end of June 2002. On request of
Government, the loan currency will be US Dollars to allow Government to maintain the
desired balance of its loan portfolio. In line with World Bank guidelines simplified
procedures will be used for the disbursement of the loan. Disbursements to be
administered by the Ministry of Finance will not be linked to World Bank procurement
requirements. Government will be required to establish a separate deposit account at the
Bank of Mauritius into which all disbursements of loan proceeds will be made.
Government will convert the US Dollar proceeds of the loan into Mauritian Rupees to be
integrated into the bujdget. The deposit account may be subject to independent audit at
the request of the BanK.
68.   The operation is likely to diversify the central Government's loan portfolio,
almost 90 percent of which is domestic liabilities, more than 80 percent of which have
maturity of less than two years. In the process, the operation is expected to reduce the
potential crowding out of the private sector that would occur from domestic financing.
Subsequent Bank Support
69.   Subsequent support of the implementation of the NEA will depend on the
(i) continued implementation of policies and programs in the prioritized areas specified in
table 6 above, and (ii) maintenance of a sustainable macroeconomic framework. The
milestones in columns 2 and 3 of table 6 above will be used to assess progress in the
priority areas and will also determine the need for additional Bank financing under
subsequent lending operations, in line with the overall framework outlined in the CAS.
C. Monitoring and Evaluation
70.   Government and the Bank have agreed on monitoring and evaluation activities to
be carried out at various levels: As a first step, monitoring will concentrate on the
specific macroeconomic targets set out in the first and second year of the NEA as
specified in the Letter of Development Policy attached to this document. This includes
- 24 -



(i) real GDP growth of 5.3 percent in 2001/2002 and 4.6 percent in 2002/2003; (ii) the
budget deficit approximately 6.5 percent of GDP in 2001/2002 and 6.0 of GDP in
2002/2003; (iii) maintain revenue effort in 2001/02 at around 18 percent of GDP and
increase it by around 1 percent of GDP in 2002/03; and (iv) substantial realization of the
budgeted capital expenditures 2001/2002.  In addition, the Bank will assist the
Government in reviewing progress in the implementation of the milestones presented in
table 6 based on regular supervision missions.
71.   To adequately assess progress of the implementation of the NEA the Government
intends to monitor the short-and medium achievements against the input and output
targets specified in the matrix accompanying the CAS (see schedule 2 of this document)
which will be discussed by the Board together with the PERL. Of particular importance
are indicators such as (i) public secondary school enrollments; (ii) pass rates in the
primary and secondary school general examinations; (iii) implementation of anti-poverty
programs (beneficiaries in micro-credit and housing schemes); and (iv) the percentage
population connected to the central sewerage collection system.
72.   Within the next year the Government will, with support from the Bank, further
define and develop a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system which would
build on analytical work linking inputs, outputs and outcomes. While the Government
has specified outcome targets in areas including poverty reduction or education
achievements (outlined in the CAS matrix in schedule 2), further analytical work is
necessary which would link specific program actions to outcomes and establish a limited
number of core indicators to be followed for each sector. Results of such analytical work
would then assist Government in reassessing targets and defining timelines for their
achievement.
73.   An important instrument for such a monitoring and evaluation system will be the
introduction of a Medium Term Expenditure Framework which will allow Government to
link expenditures to strategic priorities and intended outcomes. This would also allow the
Government to budget its resources according to progress made in achieving its strategic
priorities. As outlined above, an action plan for the introduction of the MTEF will be
developed in FY02/03. The Bank would seek to support these activities through a
capacity building grant. In addition, the Bank and the Government intend to finalize an
Education Finance Study and a Public Expenditure Review within the next year.'3
74.   Regarding fiduciary accountability, Government expenditures are subject to
regular internal and external audits by the Internal Control Cadre and the Government's
Audit Office. A review of the audit system confirmed the efficiency and adequacy of
these control mechanisms. The Audit Office also intends to conduct value-for-money
13 The Education Finance Study aimns to assess the costs of various reform measures and the impact of
agreed measures to improve intemal efficiency in the educational system. Govermment also intends to
carry out a number of other studies in the education sector over the next two years, including (i) study of
teacher supply and demand, teacher quality, and decentralized teacher management; (ii) an intemational
comparative analysis of the relevance and pedagogic quality and the curricula at primary and secondary
school level' and (iii) and analysis of equity and private (household) contributions to education and
training, with recommendations to institutionalize equity measures in the sector.

audits in targeted areas to fiurther assess the impact of public expenditures. Such internal
and extemal audits are of particular importance given the nature of this loan.
D. BlEudgeding and IFinancial Management
75.   A prerequisite for the proposed Bank assistance is the existence of a sound
expenditure management system.   The existing system  of public expenditure
management in Mauritius and the control mechanisms are generally adequate, efficient
and transparent: key functions within the system of public finance are clearly defined and
separated with proper checks and balances.  Compliance with formal rules and
procedures is high. Budget planning is currently based on a one year timeframe which
undermines efficiency and poses some macroeconomic risks. Government therefore
intends to move to a mediumtenn expenditure framework with a 3-year time horizon,
which would link expenditures to strategic priorities under the NEA.  Budget
implementation is relatively efficient with the recurrent budgets executed as planned.
Adequately qualified staff in the various departments understand their responsibilities and
execute their functions in a timely and competent manner. Reports are generally
produced on time, with regard to actual expenditures on a monthly basis.
76.   The Director of Audit (DOA) submits annual audit reports to Parliament; the
report is subsequently published on the website of the Auditor General. The office
conducts routine and special audits in line with internationally recognized methodologies
and standards. Its mandate also includes 'value-for-money' or economy and efficiency
audits, some of whi.,} were undertaken in the past. The Public Accounts Committee
(PAC) of Parliament, which is chaired by the opposition party, reviews the findings and
recommendations of the DOA. The PAC is very active, it meets once a week for
discussions and to question senior officials of the government on the audit findings and
recommendations.
77.   The system of public procurement is equally sound and transparent. The rules
and regulations appear to be generally adequate with clearly assigned roles and
responsibilities. In 2000, a comprehensive procurement reform was repealed, because its
complexity generated significant implementation difficulties. A new reform initiative is
under way and will build on the findings and recommendations of a Country Procurement
Assessment Review (CPAR) which is expected to be completed in 2002. As part of the
CPAR exercise, a recently conducted preliminary review of procurement system by the
Bank confirmed the need to (i) further refine the regulatory framework for public
procurement and streamline the relevant procedures, (ii) standardize and computerize
procurement documentation, (iii) strengthen the capacity of procurement officers at all
levels, and to (iv) integrate ex-post review of procurement compliance in the regular
audits.
E. Risks
78.   Three main risks have been identified for the proposed operation. First, political
support may fall short of what is necessary to implement the reforms specified in the
- 26 -



NEA. Second, Government may not meet its deficit targets and be able to ensure
macroeconomic sustainability of the NEA. Third, potential capacity constraints in the
public sector may delay the implementation of the NEA, and the transformation of
Mauritius into a high-tech service economy.
79.   The first risk, shortfall in political support for the reforms, can be mitigated by
consensus building on the part of the Government and continued dialogue with key
stakeholders. The private sector has actively participated in defining the NEA. Key
strategies such as the Action Plan for Poverty Alleviation (2001) were developed on the
basis of a participatory process. To deal with the broader implications of the NEA the
Government has passed legislation establishing a National Economic and Social Council
(NESC Act December 2001) which would have advisory functions and would consist of
relevant stakeholders. The Bank will continue to emphasize the need for consultation and
participation in its dialogue with the Government and will offer to contribute to this
dialogue with further analytical work.
80.   The second risk, the macroeconomic sustainability of the NEA, mainly the danger
that Govermment may not be able to meet its deficit targets, will be mitigated by assisting
Government in developing and institutionalizing a medium term macroeconomic
framework which would (i) develop a strategy to prioritize the implementation of the
NEA and (ii) outline the deficit reduction path with explicit targets for the upcoming four
years consistent with Government's commitment to improve tax revenues. This deficit
reduction path is explicitly reflected in the attached Letter of Development Policy. In
addition, policy dialogue will focus on the development of a framework which would
allow Government to reprioritize public expenditures.
81.   The third risk, the potential capacity constraints in the course of the
implementation of the NEA, can be addressed by strengthening relevant technical and
managerial capacity and by assisting the Government to match policies with
implementation capacity. Consequently, the dialogue with the Government will focus on
further refining the government's strategy to improve capacity and quality of public
services that are responsible for the implementation of the NEA.
F. Coordination with the IMF
82.   Mauritius is on the standard Article IV cycle. However, it does not borrow from
the IMF. The last Article IV mission was completed on February 14, 2002. The Bank
participated in that mission. In its review, the IMF team paid particular attention to the
elevated public deficit and the unemployment problem. The IMF discussed with
Government options for controlling the deficit. The overall view expressed by the IMF
mission was that the macroeconomic scenario presented with the proposed operation of
this document would be sustainable if adequate revenue enhancing measures will be
taken and expenditures will be prioritized.

V. RECOMMENDATION
83.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY
INTRODUCTION
1.    Mauritius has enjoyed sustained growth for nearly two decades, with the economy
expanding at an average annual rate of over 5%. Per capita income rose fourfold to reach
US$ 3,800 in 2000. The high rates of growth masked structural weaknesses, delayed the
much-needed reforms and led to a deterioration in the economic and social conditions of
the country towards the close of the century: the budget deficit widened, savings and
investment rates stagnated and major public enterprises accumulated significant financial
losses.
2.    Since assuming office in September 2000, the present Government has taken a
series of vigorous measures to address pressing problems, in particular, to correct
imbalances in public finances, put loss-making public enterprises back on the path of
financial sustainability and restore business confidence in the management of the
economy. Thus electricity tariffs and petroleum prices have been adjusted upward to
reflect market conditions; monetary and exchange-rate policies have been fine-tuned to
strike the right balance between the need for preserving the competitiveness of export
sectors and maintaining price stability; and the institutional, legal and regulatory
framework firmed up to improve investment climate.
3.    For the medium-term, covering the next five years, an Economic Agenda for the
New Millennium has been drawn up. It lays emphasis on investing massively in
education and training, developing the ICT sector, consolidating public finances, creating
an enabling environment for development of private initiatives, enhancing export
competitiveness, and modernizing the welfare state. The objective is to maintain the
growth momentum, achieve average annual growth rates of above 5% and facilitate the
emergence of a high-tech, high-income service and knowledge economy.
4.    The present policy statement outlines Government's strategy for reform in four
key areas, namely improvement of the country's competitiveness, investing in people and
society, protection and preservation of the environment, and improvement of economic
management. The policy and strategy framework detailed out in the ensuing paragraphs
will be the basis for designing and implementing reforms by Government in the above
areas.
DEVELOPMENT ISSUES
5.    Mauritius has pursued an export-led strategy, centered initially on the production
of sugar and subsequently on manufacturing for export and tourism. In the early 1990's,
a new area of growth, namely financial services including global businesses and the
freeport, was added. This strategy has been successful. It has enabled the country to
broaden the economic base, raise the overall level of employment and expand national
incomes.



Schedule I
Page 3 of 11
6.    Several factors operating on the demand and supply sides have contributed to this
success. Prominent among these have been the availability of large pools of inexpensive
labour, generous investment incentives, policy continuity underpinned by political
stability, extensive economic and social infrastructure and, more significantly, trade
preferences for sugar and EPZ products on the European Union (EU) markets. These
factors have individually and collectively given Mauritius a competitive advantage in
high-volume, low-value textile products and helped the country carve out market niches.
In the future, however, Mauritius will not likely have the benefit of some of these factors.
Globalisation and the liberalisation of trade are eroding trade preferences, while the
emergence, in increasing numbers, of lower-cost producers is challenging the position of
Mauritius in its export markets.
7.    Other key development concerns requiring urgent attention include: (a)
deteriorating competitiveness; (b) inadequate investment in people and society; (c)
pressure on the environment; and (d) weakened economic management. These concerns
are examined below.
8.    Deterioratina comnetitiveness: Production costs in the economy, especially in
export industries, have been rising and need to be contained to improve international
competitiveness. Investment in human resource development and in new technology will
have to be raised and the adoption of international best practices accelerated. There is an
urgent need to rationalise various incentive schemes, improve the functioning of factor
markets, address the supply and capacity constraints affecting support services and
undertake reform of the country's traditional economic sectors.
9.    Inadequate investment in people and society: Mauritius has achieved universal
primary schooling. Drop-out and failure rates are, however, high. The education system
does not respond effectively to the changing needs of the rapidly modernizing economy
and society. It is also a source of social inequity. The health sector is under pressure as a
result of the demand being placed upon it in the wake of improvement in living standards,
the ageing of the population and the shift from communicable to non-communicable
diseases requiring high-tech medical care. Pension costs are rising, contributors'
benefits are low, and private pensions unregulated. The effectiveness of social aid
programmes, which include subsidies on rice and flour and income support for
individuals with special needs, is under question. Pockets of poverty across the country,
especially on the island of Rodrigues, if not tackled, can exacerbate feelings of exclusion
and marginalisation.
10.   Pressure on the environment: Rapid industrial and tourism development has
raised pressure on the environment. Surface and groundwater resources need to be
protected from contamination from effluent discharges, sewerage disposal and infiltration
from solid waste dumping sites. Major programmes for development of wastewater
infrastructure and for collection, transfer and disposal of solid waste are called for to
protect the country's natural assets: air, land and water.
11.   Weakened economic management: The budget deficit has risen from 3.8% of
GDP in fiscal year (FY) 1999/00 to 6.5 % of GDP in FY 2000/01. While recurrent
expenditure has hovered at around 21% of GDP over the past years, tax revenue to GDP
has declined from 18% to 16% in FY 2000/01. There is need to take a comprehensive
view of public expenditure within the framework of a more consolidated fiscal



Schedule I
Page 4 of 11
framework to minimize fiscal vulnerability, improve effectiveness of public expenditure
and increase value for money. While many of the public enterprises are relatively in
sound financial health, a certain number still relies on Central Government subsidies and
loan guarantees for survival.
OBJECTIVES OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND STRATEGY
12.   A key objective of Government's development policy, as outlined in the
Economic Agenda, is to develop Mauritius into a high-tech, high-income, service
economy based on ICT, financial services, tourism and the freeport while achieving
growth rates of above 5% per annum. Additionally, the aim is to:
a. improve competitiveness and enhance the employment-
generation capacity of the economy;
b. invest massively in people and society, and modernize the
welfare state with a view to responding better to the needs of
those at risk;
c. protect and preserve the country's natural assets; and
d. improve economic management, with focus on correcting
imbalances in public finances.
IMPLEMENTATION OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND STRATEGY
13.   The above policy objectives will be achieved through: (a) expansion of economic
and social infrastructure; (b) reform of the relevant institutional, legal and regulatory
frameworks; (c) development and implementation of a comprehensive approach to public
expenditure; and (d) implementation of a series of measures to remove constraints on
businesses and improve their competitiveness.
a. Improving Competitiveness
14. The Economic Agenda aims to increase competitiveness by: (i) raising the
efficiency of public sector services to economic operators; (ii) rationalising the incentive
framework and improving governance; (iii) making the factor markets work better; and
(iv) engaging in structural reforms in specific sectors and developing new areas of
growth. In doing so, the Economic Agenda is seeking to reduce gradually the
segmentation of the economy and enhance its competitiveness in world markets.
15. Improvinf efficiency of Public sector services to economic operators:
Government is modernising and restructuring the public sector to enable it to live up to
the expectations of the economy and the population. It should be in a position to serve
better economic operators and respond to their needs for cost-effective, timely and
quality services. In this context, processes and procedures, including procedures for
investment approval, are being streamlined. Towards this end, a Board of Investment has
been set up to act as one stop shop for investors, domestic and external. In the same vein,
all Government services will be brought on-line by 2005.
16.   Government has already taken a series of measures to improve the financial
viability of public enterprises most at risk. These include price and tariff adjustments for



Schedule I
Page 5 of 11
State Trading Corporation, Central Electricity Board, Central Water Authority, Mauritius
Broadcasting Corporation and Wastewater Management Authority.  In addition,
Govenmment has restructured the Development Works Corporation and is closing the
Rose Belle Sugar Factory, the only State-owned sugar factory. Government plans to
continue such efforts with other parastatals to reduce pressure on Central Government
budget. The long-term objective is to shift the performance risk of State-owned
enterprises away from taxpayers while ensuring that user charges are accompanied by
appropriate adjustments for the less privileged sections of the population.
17.   Particular emphasis will be laid on ensuring the financial viability of public
enterprises, improving their fiscal accountability and limiting their contingent liabilities.
Government will encourage public enterprises to enter into strategic partnerships with
well-established entities to benefit from their technical know-how and management
experience. Mauritius Telecom has already concluded an alliance with France Telecom.
The Cargo Handling Corporation is expected to select a strategic partner by the end of
2002. The possibility for the CEB, the CWA and postal services to contract such
alliances will be pursued. Furthermore, parastatals will be required to prepare regular
corporate plans and adopt best management practices, including management information
systems, to help raise efficiency.
18.   Government's aim is to render the markets for utilities more competitive. This
will help improve transportation infrastructure and bring down the cost of
communication, including connectivity.
19.   Rationalisatie n of the incentive framework: Government will rationalise the
existing investment incentive regimes, including that for the offshore sector. In this
context, a comprehensive assessment of direct and indirect tax incentives as well as other
incentives stemming from the functioning of factor markets will be undertaken. The new
framework will aim at creating a level-playing field and enhancing the competitiveness of
Mauritius to attract FDI. New WTO-compatible legislation and a set of benchmarks on
fiscal regimes in selected sectors in the region will also be produced.
20.   Good governance:     Good   governance  - accountability, transparency,
responsibility, fair treatment, and management discipline - is emerging as a major
development issue. Government will actively promote good govemance practices in both
the public and private sectors. A Committee on Corporate Govemance has been set up
since September 2001. It is working on a "Shareholders' Charter" and a "Code of Board
Best Practices". Government has also secured the collaboration of the World Bank for
preparing a "Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes" (ROSC Assessment) to
benchmark the corporate govemance regime in Mauritius against international principles.
This document will be prepared in consultation with all stakeholders. The first Code on
Good Governance for Mauritius is expected to be ready by mid-2002. In the long run, an
"Institute of Directors" will be established.
21.   Labour market reforms: Government will initiate measures to improve the
functioning of the labour market. A labour law reform is under elaboration. It aims at
instilling greater flexibility in the labour market, enhancing productivity and fostering
economic and social development. Government actively promotes dialogue among social
partners. Government is also reviewing the current wage-determination mechanism.



Schedule I
Page 6 of 11
22.   CaDital markets: Capital markets will be reformed to meet best international
practices and standards. The market and information infrastructure will be strengthened,
an active and liquid market for Government securities and exchange-traded derivatives
will be developed, and the investor base will be gradually broadened.
23.   Surar: Government is conscious that the viability of the oldest industry, sugar, is
under threat as a result of significant erosion of trade preferences in the EU market,
continuous fall in sugar prices and rising domestic costs of production. Government has
drawn up, after extensive consultations with stakeholders, a Sugar Sector Strategic Plan
for the period 2001-2005. The target of the Plan is to reduce the cost of production from
US cents 18 to 14 per lb and, in the next phase, to 12 US cents per lb. This will be
achieved mainly through the centralization of sugar-milling, man-power rightsizing and
enhanced field and factory efficiency. In this context, it is planned to close down about
half of the existing sugar factories (including the only State-owned one) and have only
around 8 modem units with higher processing capacity. A Voluntary Retirement Scheme
(VRS) against cash and land compensation has been introduced that would lead to a
reduction in the labour force of the sugar industry by 27%. The Plan further includes
measures for accelerating field derocking and mechanization and irrigation projects,
reducing sugar loss, improving productivity of small planters, making optimal use of
sugar by-products, including bagasse for electricity generation, and for a more flexible
policy-approach to release agricultural land. The enabling legislation, the Sugar Industry
Efficiency Act 2001, has been passed in August 2001.
24.   Textile and clothing:  A strategic plan for addressing the constraints and
challenges faced by the textile and clothing sector is being elaborated. The High-
Powered Committee set up for this purpose has already completed its Report, and has
made a number of specific recommendations for restructuring the sector. The thrust of
the recommendations is to promote an upgrading of production to the medium-end
market segment, further diversify the garment range and strengthen the on-going skills
realignment, technology upgrading and productivity improvement drive.  The
restructuring exercise will be accompanied by institutional, fiscal and financial support
measures. These are currently being worked out.
25.   Tourism:    A Tourism Development Plan for Mauritius has been completed.
It presents a 20-year vision and a five-year action programme to provide a framework for
implementation of the first stage of the Plan. Implementation of the Plan will begin
during the course of 2002. Emphasis will continue to be placed on promoting Mauritius
as a high value-added, high-quality destination, building on the personal service
excellence for which Mauritius is well known.
26.   Financial services: Government has already initiated the necessary legal and
institutional reforms in the financial services sector to enable the country to position itself
as an international financial centre of repute. Three Acts have recently been passed,
namely the Financial Services Development Act 2001, the Companies Act 2001, and the
Trusts Act 2001. A Financial Services Commission (FSC) has been set up as a unified
regulatory body for all non-bank financial institutions, operating in both the onshore and
offshore sectors. It will facilitate the integration of onshore and offshore activities.
Eventually, the FSC will be integrated with the Bank of Mauritius to provide for a single
regulator for both banking and non-banking activities. Promotion of the sector will be



Schedule I
Page 7 of 11
carried out by a special entity, the Financial Services Promotion Agency (FSPA). Both
the FSC and FSPA became operational in December 2001. Likewise, the revamping of
the legal framework for the freeport was completed in July 2001. The objective is to give
a new boost to the transformation of Mauritius into a logistics, marketing and distribution
hub in the region.
27.   Information and Communication Technoloev aICT) sector: Government is
committed to developing the ICT sector as a fifth pillar of the economy. The ultimate
aim is to develop Mauritius into a Cyber Island and a knowledge hub. As a first step,
Government is planning to build a dedicated cyber city, complete with necessary
infrastructure and international connectivity. Construction work is scheduled to start in
mid-2002. A comprehensive legal framework is being put in place to support the
development of a strong ICT industry. The provision of telecommunication value-added
services, including the Internet, has been liberalized, while liberalization of the
telecommunication services will become effective as from December 2003. Government
will ensure that adequate connectivity and internationally competitive rates are available.
b. Investing in People and Society
28.   Educational reform: Government will give top priority to human resource
development and to enhance the efficiency of the education system. Government is
undertaking a major educational reform that will necessitate heavy investment.
Expenditure on education has increased in FY 2001/02 by 34% compared to FY 2000/01
to reach Rs 5.6 billion. Expenditure in the sector is expected to remain high in the
coming years.
29.   Educational reforms proper will focus on: (i) introduction of a new examination
system at the primary level based on grading instead of ranking to improve access to
secondary education; (ii) introduction of universal eleven years of compulsory education;
(iii) increased access to quality education through the construction of 17 new Form I-V
State Secondary Schools (SSS) on a regional basis and the upgrading and extension of a
number of existing SSS; (iv) transformation of some of the 'star' colleges into Form VI
National Colleges; (v) modernisation of school curriculum for primary and secondary
education, with special focus on the introduction of computer science; (vi) setting up of
pre-vocational streams within the existing and new secondary schools; (vii) formulation
of programmes to address the problems of low-performance schools; and (viii) increased
access to, and enhancement of the quality of, tertiary education.
30.   Capacities for technical education and training will be expanded to provide
greater access to the population and meet the growing skills needs of the economy.
Training and retraining will assume critical importance in Government efforts to reduce
skills mismatches and to ensure that the country adapts to the changing needs of industry
and meets its quality targets. In this context, measurable targets will be developed to
promote the efficiency of resource use.
31.   Government will set up a Mauritius Qualifications Authority (MQA). It will be
responsible for development of the National Qualifications Framework, which will
ensure greater articulation between education, training and the world of work. The MQA
will help rationalise and streamline the certification system and boost vocational and



Schedule I
Page 8 of 11
technical training. Govermnent will also set up a Human Resource Development Council
to spearhead its training strategy.
32.   Social welfare: The top-down approach to the design and implementation of
social aid programmes has not helped to reduce economic and social disparities.
Government is reviewing the efficiency of available social aid programmes at the policy
and technical levels. It has already initiated a new set of short- to -medium-term
measures to address the issue and alleviate the feeling of marginalisation and exclusion
among the most vulnerable groups. An Action Plan for Poverty Alleviation, focusing on
an integrated approach, has been formulated in consultation with civil society and other
stakeholders. The Plan lays emphasis on empowerment of the poor to secure their
involvement in productive activities through better access to education and credit
facilities.
33.   As part of the Action Plan, training schemes will be designed for various target
groups, including school drop-outs. A community-based participatory approach will be
adopted to identify the needs of the most vulnerable groups and to formulate tailor-made
programmes for them. Housing schemes to cater for the very low-income and low-
income groups and the homeless will be implemented. Social aid programmes will be
streamlined to ensure a judicious use of public funds, and micro-credit schemes will be
rationalised and expanded to ensure greater access of the disadvantaged groups to
finance. Emphasis will be placed on meeting the changing needs of the population for
health services. Measures will focus on expanding accessibility of the population, in
particular the most needy, to health facilities. In addition, the private sector will be called
upon to play a more active role in the provision of health care services.
34. Pension reform: Government intends to modernize the pension system. The aim
is to: (i) contain the fiscal cost of the basic pension; (ii) increase returns to assets of the
contributory scheme and thereby raise pension benefits to contributors at retirement; and
(iii) establish a regulatory and supervisory framework for occupational schemes and
voluntary individual provision. Government has set up a Ministerial Committee to look
into the functioning of the pension system. Four sub-committees are already working
respectively on the Basic Retirement Pension, the compulsory contributory pension
scheme (the National Pension Fund/the National Savings Fund), the civil service pension,
and private pension plans. Analytical work is currently underway to examine the
effectiveness and sustainability of existing schemes. Government is already working on
a regulatory and supervisory framework for private pension schemes.
c. Protection of the Environment
35.   Mauritius has integrated environmental concerns into its development process and
developed National Environmental Strategies (NES) to prevent environment degradation.
These foresee the need for changes in existing policies, including the adoption of
"polluter pays" principle.
36.   There is need to halt and reverse pollution by wastewater and develop an
integrated solid waste strategy. As regards the wastewater sector, its development is
overseen by the newly-established Wastewater Management Authority. The latter is
responsible for the implementation of a National Sewerage Programme. Work on several
sewerage projects is currently in progress. For the solid waste sector, an integrated Solid



Schedule 1
Page 9 of 11
Waste Management Programme has been prepared. The objective is to put in place a
cost-effective and environmentally sound solid waste collection, transfer and disposal
system for all solid wastes country-wide.
d. Improving Economic Management
37.   Macroeconomic framework: The policies and programmes outlined in the
Economic Agenda will have major macroeconomic implications for the country. Within
a medium-term macroeconomic framework that maintains economic stability,
Government will seek to obtain the best possible results for its expenditure programme.
Fiscal discipline will be a major component of this macroeconomic framework.
38.   Government is committed to reducing the present Central Government budget
deficit of 6.5% of GDP to 6% or below in FY 2002/03 and subsequently by about one
percentage point annually to reach around 3% of GDP in FY 2005/06. This will include
all Central Government outlays to parastatal enterprises. The reduction of budget deficit
will be achieved through both revenue measures and prioritisation of expenditures.
39.   The budget deficit of 6.5% of GDP for FY 2000/01 has had to be maintained at
the same level in FY 2001/02 on account of a conscious effort of Government to launch a
long overdue set of second-generation reforms and programmes by channelling resources
to the priority sectors of the economy. The new spending package aims at redirecting
expenditures from recurrent to capital budget and from lower to higher priority areas, in
line with Government objectives for: (i) strengthening the human and physical capital of
the country; (ii) framing Mauritian aspirations more in terms of quality rather than
quantity; (iii) actively harnessing the promises of digital revolution; (iv) promoting
greater private sector participation and competition in the provision of infrastructure,
utilities and core services; and (v) building a fairer society and providing adequate
protection for the disadvantaged sections of the population.
40.   Another critical issue is the implication of Economic Agenda policies and
programmes on the budget and Central Government debt. Public debt as a percentage of
GDP, as at end June 2001, stood at about 48.9%, with domestic debt accounting for
almost 90% of total debt. External debt of parastatal bodies represented 15% of GDP at
the same period. An effective management of the debt situation is thus important for
sound public finances. Government is therefore strengthening its Debt Management Unit
to monitor the status of public debt, refine the present debt management strategy and
minimise the cost of borrowing.
41.   BudRet reform: To secure fiscal discipline, Government has already initiated a
growth-friendly fiscal consolidation programme, with emphasis on high-quality reduction
in the deficit. The key components of the medium-term fiscal adjustment programme are
revenue consolidation, expenditure restructuring and management, and the adoption of a
medium-term framework. The aim is to help Government attain its deficit targets.
42.   On the revenue side, Government has launched a major reform programme to
modernise the entire tax administration system. This includes: (i) creation of a large
taxpayers' department; (ii) setting up of a centralised tax administration; (iii)
modernisation of tax and customs administration systems and procedures, including
increased coordination and cooperation between tax and customs departments; (iv)

review of direct taxes to address the equity and tax buoyancy issues; (v) scaling down of
large dispersions and inefficiencies of the tariff system; (vi) strengthening of value added
tax (VAT) administration - specially the registration, audit and enforcement functions;
and more importantly (vii) joint tax audits of the various revenue departments.
43.   Government has also initiated a series of measures to tackle the anomalies and
inconsistencies in the excise tax system. These measures will raise tax efficiency and
minimise the risk of revenue loss arising from trade liberalisation under various regional
and international arrangements. Government is also committed to restructure public
spending and improve expenditure controls and budgetary processes by: (i) restraining
current expenditure; (ii) improving the efficiency of the civil service and welfare
expenditures and meeting the needs of the genuinely disadvantaged; (iii) readjusting the
social maintenance programmes that will impact on the financing, structure and delivery
of social services; (iv) restructuring public enterprises to restore them as viable units; and
(v) reviewing the efficiency, equity and sustainability of the pension system.
44.   The reform programme in the budgeting process includes the implementation of a
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The multi-year approach of the MTEF
will provide a clear indication of expenditure for the medium term and help define
priorities within an aggregate expenditure ceiling. With a view to developing a budgetary
process that has a consistent macroeconomic framework, together with a holistic and
comprehensive view of fiscal policy objectives, Govermment is setting up a high-level
committee to examine the scope of the MTEF to be adopted.
45.   The high cost of the Economic Agenda and the need for ensuring efficiency of
expenditure warrant a close monitoring of the implementation of the programme.
Government will optimize the use of existing resources and monitoring mechanisms in
the short term. Concurrently, as part of the development of the MTEF, it will further
refine and extend the existing monitoring mechanisms and develop a comprehensive
monitoring and evaluation system which would link inputs with measurable outputs.
46. Fiduciary and fiscal vulnerabilitv: Government has made considerable progress
in strengthening the existing framework of fiduciary accountability and reducing fiscal
vulnerability. Various off-budget Government funds have been consolidated with the
Central Government budget for better transparency. Work has been initiated on the
compilation of a consolidated fiscal deficit. The issue of exposure of parastatals is also
being addressed. Government oversight of parastatals, including the enforcement of
accountability of parastatals and other public sector bodies, will be further strengthened.
47.   An important factor in strengthening fiduciary accountability is Government's
commitment to reform the country's procurement system. Sound procurement policies
and practices are among the essential elements of good governance. Government, in
collaboration with the World Bank, has already agreed on the conduct of a
comprehensive assessment of the system. This will help identify possible reforms in the
procurement system aimed at further improving its accountability, integrity and
transparency and reducing the scope for corruption. The Task Force on Procurement will
be the coordinating and support unit to the World Bank's assessment exercise.

CONCLUSION
48.   Govermment has the firm conviction that it will succeed in introducing second-
generation reforms. It is determined to confront the policy choices for restructuring the
economy and building strong macroeconomic, institutional and social underpinnings to
power the country's drive to a higher plane of economic development. It has already
embarked on a process to define its priorities and rebalance the policy mix towards
capacity building, technology upgrading, addressing infrastructural and investment
bottlenecks and building a fairer society.
49.   The new approach of Government in forging an open and democratic society has
ushered in a new style of government that believes in consensus building. This has been
demonstrated by the setting up of the National Economic and Social Council as the forum
for dialogue and for building consensus on national issues. Thus local communities,
NGOs, civil society, religious bodies, workers' organisations and all interested groups
can join forces to give meaning to the multifarious struggles of the Mauritian people for
greater control of their own lives, for decent standards of health, education, housing and
nutrition, for social justice and for ageing with attitude. It is a new contract between the
State and the Citizen designed to bring public and private interests into closer alignment
for a better government. This new contract aims at greater transparency, responsibility
and responsiveness. It reflects Government's intention to create a new social welfare
system which promotes opportunity instead of dependence.
WORLD BANK SUPPORT
50.   Mauritius will implement, over the next five years, the measures outlined in the
Economic Agenda for the New Millennium to enable it to make a quantum leap into the
next phase of its economic development. Government wishes to have recourse to the
Public Expenditure Reform Loan (PERL) as one of the sources to finance its budget and
economic reforms that will transform Mauritius into a diversified, hi-tech, high-income,
service and knowledge economy and increase its capacity to meet the social needs of its
population.
