3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
Background
3.1.1  Mauritius' remarkable economic growth has been based on traditional products and
services-sugar, textiles, and tourism-and on a broad and effective social pact that has brought together
what is a very diverse society. Today, Mauritians wish to achieve more: they want higher incomes and jobs
in the higher value-added service sectors. At the same time their economy is being challenged: (i) the
phasing out of preferential trade access is likely to harm the traditional sources of growth; (ii) the
environmental fragility and the small capacity of the island is likely to constrain the growth of tourism; (iii)
the fiscal deficit has been worsening since FY 1999/2000 and govermment indebtedness has been gradually
rising; and (iv) unemployment has reached levels not witnessed since the mid-1980s (it currently stands at
about 10 percent). Poverty affects approximately 10 percent of the population (Bank estimates) but is
concentrated in certain regions, which, primarily due to a lack of education, have been excluded from the
"Mauritian miracle" and need to be helped.
3.1.2  In 2001, the Government of Mauritius set an ambitious medium-term development objective: to
change the course of the country's economy and turn it into a "high-tech, high-income service and
knowledge economy in five years' time." The New Economic Agenda (NEA) was presented to the National
Assembly in June 2001 jointly with the FY 2001/02 budget. The NEA's key components are: (i)
improvement in the competitiveness of Mauritius' private sector; (ii) investment in people and society; (iii)
preservation of Mauritius' fragile environment; and (iv) improvement in economic management.
3.1.3 During the course of preparation of the NEA (between September 2000, when the government was
elected, and June 2001), the Government of Mauritius demonstrated a strong commitment to fiscal
management and to improving the development prospects of the country by taking important actions to
stabilize the economy and introducing a much-needed education reform The key stabilization actions were:
(i) adjustment of petroleum prices and electricity prices to avert losses by parastatals; (ii) an increase in
VAT from 10 percent to 12 percent; (iii) integration of off-budget items into the budget; and (iv)
improvements in tax administration. In view of this commitment and the appropriateness of the NEA in
addressing Mauritius' development objectives, the World Bank designed a Country Assistance Strategy
(Board May 7, 2002) that fully supports the NEA. Designed around program support and analytical and
advisory services, the new CAS represents a departure from traditional project financing. It foresees up to
three independent Public Expenditure Reform Loan (PERL) program support operations over the
three-year CAS period, depending on the government's external financing needs. Although program
support under the PERLs would cover all budgetary expenditures, analytical and advisory services would
give priority to human development, the environment and transport, and economic management. The
PERLs are to be designed and disbursed against actions already taken by the government as it completes
the essential building blocks of the NEA.
Objectives
3.1.4 The first PERL had the broad objective of supporting the launch of the government's five-year
reform program (the New Economic Agenda), the goals of which were to maintain the country's growth
performance and improve the welfare of its citizens. The NEA sought to accomplish these goals by
stabilizing the economy and strengthening the private sector, investing in people, protecting the
-2 -



environment, and modernizing economic management. The government's medium-term policy objectives
for the NEA, the implementation benchmarks, and progress through March 2003 are presented in Annex
10. Bank support was linked to helping the NEA achieve the following specific medium-term outcomes:
Investing in people and society
1.     Produce a better educated workforce that fully meets the requirements of the public
and private sector.
2.    Improve social cohesion and seek a fairer distribution of the benefits of growth and
greater inclusion for all population groups in the island.
Environment and transport
3.     Ensure the liquid waste, solid waste and transport sectors are financially, institutionally
and legally sustainable and that they operate in full compliance with environmental
standards.
Economic management
4.     Ensure medium and long-term fiscal sustainability.
5.     Better align expenditures with the country's strategic priorities.
3.1.5 The PERL aimed to assist the government, in the first year of the NEA, to set the foundation for
attaining these medium-term outcomes.
3.1.6 The NEA identifies further complementary actions to strengthen the environment for private sector
development, but these are not directly supported by the PERL. These actions include encouraging better
corporate governance, developing the country's information technology base (including liberalizing
telecommunications), addressing critical structural problems of the sugar sector and textile sectors, and
reforming the financial sector.
3.2 Revised Objective:
Not applicable.
3.3 Original Components:
3.3.1  The PERL was a single-tranche operation for US$40,000,000, disbursed against actions taken
through March 2002 by the Govemment of Mauritius in the implementation of the NEA.
3.3.2  The first- year objectives of the NEA, which were supported by the PERL, were:
Investing in people and society: Education and Training
1.    Design an education reform, obtain public support for that reform, and make the
necessary infrastructure, curriculum and institutional changes, to support the reform.
Investing in people and society: Poverty alleviation andpensions
2.     Develop a comprehensive approach to poverty alleviation in Mauritius and to
expeditiously provide assistance to Mauritius' most poverty stricken region, the
island of Rodrigues.
3.     Complete background work for a strategy to reform the national pension scheme.
- 3 -



Environment and Transport
4.     Obtain limited cost recovery in wastewater management.
5.     Make important decisions on transport to alleviate congestion on Mauritius' main
urban corridor.
Economic Management
6.     Stabilize the economy.
7.     Define a course for improved public expenditure management over the
medium term.
Milestones for the first and second year of the NEA are presented in Table A. 1.3. An assessment of the
attainment of objectives is presented in
Section 4.2. Although the PERL contained no pension reform milestone for 2001/02, the World Bank
provided advice to the government with the aim of completing the White Paper on the reform of the
national pension scheme, which is a 2002/03 milestone.
3.4 Revised Components:
Not applicable.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
3.5.1  The quality at entry was Satisfactory.
Rationale for Bank involvement
3.5.2 Mauritius presented to the Bank a reasoned and ambitious medium-term program that remains
critical for the future development of the country. The Bank assessed the medium term program in the
CAS. The Bank's value added in Mauritius would be to (i) provide knowledge services and advice that
support implementation of the Government vision, and (ii) provide financing of the overall program to help
ease the pressure on domestic interest rates.
Design of the operation
3.5.3  The PERL team identified the following characteristics of Mauritius' reform program: (i) the
government's commitment to a medium-term vision; (ii) its need for knowledge assistance (iii) its internal
capacity in budget implementation; (iv) the very ambitious nature of the reform agenda; and (v) the low
importance that the government attached to project financing. These characteristics shaped the design of the
operation. First, the PERL drew entirely on policy priorities of the NEA. The Letter of Development
Policy (LDP) for the PERL confirmed the linkages between government priorities and Bank support need
for maintaining sustainable fiscal framework. Second, the strong demonstrated commitment of the
government enabled the PERL to be based on actions taken. Third, the PERL was a single-tranche
operation but formed part of a flexible medium-term financing arrangement under the CAS. This gave
flexibility to the program given that the government faced a capacity risk in scaling up to meet the needs of
the ambitious reform agenda. Finally, the PERL supported the government in the development of
milestones, a critical tool for focusing implementation of the NEA.

Quality at entry and quality control
3.5.4  The Bank has had a long-standing relationship with Mauritius prior to the development of the
PERL, building country knowledge against which the initial assessments of the NEA were made. The work
produced during this relationship includes a Public Expenditure Review (May 1999, covering economic
management, education, health, and pensions); three education loans (the Industrial and Vocational
Training Project, the Education Sector Development Project, and the Higher and Technical Education
Project, all closed on February 28, 1999, because of delays in implementation and disbursement); extensive
background work on pensions, poverty, and social assistance (financed by an Institutional Development
Fund (IDF) grant and Bank resources); supervision of an environment, sewerage, and sanitation project;
supervision a Global Enviromnent Facility (GEF) grant; supervision of two financial sector projects; and a
1995 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), which remains relevant to Mauritius today. The Country
Team appropriately considered that the existing analytical work, along with the team's own evaluation,
provided sufficient basis to assess that (i) the chosen areas of focus of the Mauritius reform program and
(ii) the depth of the proposed reforms would be instrumental in setting the foundation for a new course in
Mauritius' development. Due to the urgent need to support the NEA in its first year of implementation, the
Bank team made the reasonable choice to rely on existing analytical work in the preparation of the PERL
rather than proceed with new studies.
3.5.5   Quality Enhancement Review (OER). To support its work on the PERL, and given the
innovative nature of the operation, in January 2002 the preparation team requested that a Quality
Enhancement Review be undertaken. The review analyzed the initial design of the project and made
recommendations as to the potential areas of concentration of World Bank advice. The QER recommended
the following as potential areas of assistance: management of fiscal risks, and especially contingent
liabilities; outcome-oriented budgeting; and a review of the civil service. Given the capacity in Mauritius
and the existing knowledge base, the QER advocated pacing the analytical work with client needs rather
than producing standard Bank reports. These recommendations have largely been followed.
3.5.6   Fifth Ouality Assurance Group (OAG) Ouality-At-Entry Assessment. The PERL was randomly
selected for a QAG assessment (July-August 2002), as part of the pool of projects that went to the Board in
2001/02. Overall, the program was assessed as Satisfactory. The assessment found the strategic relevance
and fiduciary aspects of the PERL to be Highly Satisfactory, but it was critical of the implementation
arrangements, which, singling out the education sector, it rated as Marginally Satisfactory. The QAG
questioned the timeframe for the implementation of the complex sector reforns, and wamed that the tight
implementation schedule could complicate the sequencing and phasing of the following PERLs. The
assessment also called attention to the need to improve the monitoring and implementation framework of
the NEA reform program.
Coordination with the IMF and other donors
3.5.8  The Bank coordinated with the International Monetary Fund (fIF) in assessing Mauritius' fiscal
sustainability. The overall view expressed by the RMF Article IV mission, in which the Bank participated,
is that the base case macroeconomic scenario (see Table A. 1.1) presented with the PERL was sustainable;
within the framework, the Government of Mauritius planned to raise revenues and keep expenditures in
check (relative to GDP) with the aim of reducing the overall fiscal deficit to about 3 percent of GDP by FY
2005/06.
-5-



3.5.9 Twenty-nine donor organizations operate in Mauritius, in addition to the Bank and the IMF. The
Bank coordinates with donors primarily through the counterpart ministries, which are responsible for
designing their development programs and identifying funding sources. Among the donors, the European
Union has decided to reorient its assistance for Mauritius to budgetary support in FY 2003/04 and FY
2004/05, much along the lines of the PERL.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
4.1.1  The outcome of the Public Expenditure Reform Loan (PERL) operation has been deemed
satisfactory, as it has achieved its original objectives of helping the government to (i) improve
macroeconomic and fiscal management and (ii) launch priority sectoral reforms (education and training,
poverty and pensions, environment and transport, and economic management). Mauritius has set a good
foundation for implementation of the second year of the NEA, and is within reach of the NEA's five-year
intended outcomes. The new budget for FY 2002/03 is supporting NEA priorities.
4.1.2 Given the broad nature of the PERL operation, the assessment of the program rests on: (i) the
economic performiance of the country (as the NEA aims to maintain economic growth); (ii) an assessment
of the structural reforms in the productive sectors under the NEA (these may not be of primary Bank focus,
but they are telling of the quality of the broad reform agenda that the World Bank program intended to
support); (iii) overall fiscal performance; (iv) the quality of budget implementation; (v) continuity in policy
implementation; and (vi) an assessment of performance by components.
4.1.3 Economic performance. Mauritius' macroeconomic performance in FY 2001/02 was good,
although less strong than expected. GDP grew at 4.7 percent over the previous fiscal year, compared to the
forecast 5.3 percent. This masks a GDP growth of 3.3 percent for calendar year 2002, in which the
economy suffered from a low sugar crop (non-sugar GDP in 2002 was 4.4 percent) due to the impact of
Cyclone Dina; a small contraction in textiles, partially stemming from the political crisis in Madagascar,
which had been an attractive location for Mauritian textiles investors; and lower growth than expected in
tourism and financial services. The economy is expected to grow at 4.9 percent in FY 2002/03. This is
better than planned at appraisal, but will start from a lower base than was planned in FY 2001/02. The
extemal current account remained at a surplus of 5.6 percent of GDP in FY 2001/02, primarily due to
lower imports than in the previous year.
4.1.4 Structural reforms in the productive sectors. Mauritius has stayed the course in its structural
reform of the productive sectors, as was spelled out in the Letter of Development Policy. In the sugar
sector, the landmark Sugar Sector Strategic Plan has helped to restructure the sector and shed labor (with
compensation). In the industrial sector, a medium-term strategic plan for the textile and clothing industry
has been elaborated and the government is actively supporting the process of industrial restructuring,
including vertical integration. In both sugar and textiles, the objectives are to increase productivity and
value added. In the financial sector, the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Services
Promotion Agency are already operational, as is the Financial Intelligence Unit. Legislation to regulate the
nonbank financial sector is being developed (including private pensions), and a code of Corporate
Governance and a Shareholders Charter are being prepared. The government has set up the Independent
Commnission against Corruption, which is now fully operational. Finally, the government is forging ahead
with the creation of an Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) sector, with likely
specialization in Data Recovery Systems (DRS) and Back Office Services (BOS). The government has
-6-



completed, one year ahead of schedule, the liberalization of telecommunications services (fixed line,
cellular, and Intemet service provider (ISP).
4.1.5 Overallfiscal performance and debt management. The implementation of the FY 2001/02 budget
was satisfactory, as fiscal targets were surpassed on the overall deficit side (Table A. 1.1), revenue efforts
were significant, and expenditures were largely in line with budgetary allocations (Table A.1.2). The
better-than-expected fiscal performance in FY 2001/02 (deficit of 6.0 instead of 6.5 percent of GDP) was
partially due to some delays in capital investments, particularly in education (education reform nonetheless
remains on course). Mauritius' public debt relative to GDP for FY 2001/02 is turning out higher than
expected, partially due to the peculiar practice of the Bank of Mauritius of issuing govemment bills to
control inflation-for the first time, at end-FY 2001/02 this resulted in substantial cash balances for the
government. The PERL helped alleviate pressure on interest rates and allowed the government to implement
part of its debt management strategy; specifically, to reduce the recourse to domestic borrowing and to keep
the share of external long-term debt at about 11 percent of central government debt (similar to FY2000/01).
At PERL appraisal, it was intended that by end-FY 2001/02 government would increase its share of
external long-term debt to almost 12 percent of its total debt.
4.1.6 Quality of budget implementation. The FY 2001/02 budget was by and large implemented as
planned. Table A. 1.2 illustrates that the planned reprioritization of the FY 2001/02 budget away from
productive sectors toward the social sectors was maintained, although the reprioritization away from
recurrent to capital expenditures was modest. Overall, the government spent less than planned on the
recurrent side and much less than planned on the capital side, benefiting the deficit but attesting to some
implementation delays. The reprioritization within the social sectors did not materialize as anticipated.
Capital expenditures in the health sector forged ahead despite the fact that the Health Sector White Paper
has not been approved by government.
4.1.7 New budget reflects continuation of PERL-supported policies. The FY 2002/03 government
budget reflects the continuation of the NEA priorities initiated in FY 2001/02, including the landmark
reform in education (Table A. 1.2, column 8), with additional emphasis on the development of the ICT
sector.
4 2 Outputs by components-
Investing in people and society: Education and training
4.2.1  The Government of Mauritius has fully met its objective of launching its landmark education
reform. Should it stay the course, the impact of the reform is expected to be substantial. Prior to the PERL
preparation, the government had already extended mandatory education from 6 to 11 years of schooling; it
also had allocated Rs. 1 billion to educational infrastructure in its FY 2001/02 budget. Subsequently the
government has made good progress toward its FY 2002/03 milestones, as follows: (i) a new exam system,
which has effectively eliminated national ranking for entrance into secondary school in favor of a regional
structure, was introduced in December 2002, (ii) decentralization of the secondary education system has
been accomplished; (iii) both the primary and secondary program curricula have been largely revised;
- 7 -



300 teachers have been hired and trained for teaching infornation technologies (IT), and construction of IT
laboratories is underway (the introduction of ICT) as a subject in primary schools, however, has been
delayed until end-2003); (iv) the government is developing a detailed financial programming of the reform,
and with Bank assistance is pursuing fmancial analysis of the investment and its recurrent costs; and (v) a
prograrn has been fornulated to address the problems of low-performing schools (Zones Education
Prioritaires; ZEPs). New secondary schools are being built and existing ones improved. The Rs. 1 billion
allocated to educational infrastrucutre in FY 2001/02 (table A1.2 in annex 1) was intended to cover the
construction of secondary schools, given the higher anticipated needs due to the change in the
end-of-primary CPEs and the abolition of the ranking system. Of the 28 secondary schools planned for
construction or extension, seven were completed by December 2002, six are planned for completion by
June 2003, and the remainder are scheduled for completion by December 2003. The government had
planned a higher completion rate for the schools, but the delay owing to coordination issues, has not set
back the implementation of the reform. The host of reforms taking place is expected to reverse the
downward trend in Certificate of Primary Education (CPE) pass rates that persisted even through 2002
(The CPE is the end-of-primary exam and the gateway to secondary education). The Bank's value added in
this reform has been in (i) meeting the urgent and critical need to cost the entire education reform, (ii)
offering advice on curricula development, and (iii) providing assistance in developing the Mauritius
Qualifications Authority as a regulatory agency for vocational training. The Bank additionally is drafting
an Education Sector Note that will bring together policy, institutional management, and reform
management issues.
Investing in people and society: Poverty alleviation and pensions
4.2.2 The Government of Mauritius has only partially met its objective of developing a comprehensive
approach to poverty alleviation. The impact of poverty alleviation efforts at this early stage of policy design
is likely to be modesL Prior to the PERL preparation, the government had already developed a national
Action Plan for Poverty Alleviation (APPA) and increased the budgetary allocation to the island of
Rodrigues, one of the poorest parts of Mauritius, to Rs. 1 billion. The government's progress toward the
FY 2002/03 milestones since has been mixed. It has proceeded decisively in funding specific interventions
such as the development program for Rodrigues, the Zones Education Prioritaires for low-performing
schools, very-low-income housing programs, and microcredit schemes. However, it is still in the very early
stages of developing a cohesive, reasoned approach to social assistance, based on impact evaluation.
Development of such a program could lead to the rationalization of existing programs, better targeting of
interventions and also quite possibly to budgetary savings. With the help of extemal consulting services
Mauritius has completed a draft review of the 10 largest welfare schemes, but the review needs to be
discussed, intemalized, and extended. As regards the Rs. 1 billion allocation for Rodrigues, about 57
percent of the Rs. 0.8 billion allocated under the Ministry for Local Government and Rodrigues was
executed in FY 2002/03 (the remnaining Rs. 0.2 million was allocated through other agencies); although this
amount is less than planned, it did represent almost twice the same ministry's FY 2000/01 expenditure on
the island. The ambitious investment program for Rodrigues has been accompanied by political changes:
the first Rodrigues Regional Assembly will be elected in 2003. The Bank's value added has been in
providing assistance with the welfare schemes' assessment through an IDF grant, as a follow-up to earlier
advice on modemization of the welfare system.
4.2.3  The government has partially met its objective of developing, by June 2003, a White Paper on
reform of the national pension scheme. The preparatory work continues and completion of the White Paper
is now scheduled for December 2003. The impact of the progress to date on pension reform in Mauritius is
expected to be modest, as the design of the reform is not complete and the most challenging aspects are not
yet under implementation. Recent improvements in the management of the reform, including the creation of
- 8-



a secretariat to assist the Interministerial Committee for Pension Reform and appointment of a lead adviser,
are promising. The delays experienced in the preparation of the White Paper should be viewed in the
context of the importance of creating a homegrown reform management structure, which is likely to benefit
Mauritius in the future. The Bank's value added in its two-year involvement on pensions has been to assist
the government in defining the pension problematic and the reforrn options, and in building an institutional
structure that will design and implement a suitable pension reform for Mauritius.
Environment and transport
4.2.4 The Government of Mauritius has partially met its objectives of obtaining limited cost recovery in
the wastewater sector. The impact on sector outcomes is expected to be modest, although the budgetary
implications could be substantially negative if cost recovery in wastewater is not enforced. Prior to the
PERL preparation, the government had already enacted the Wastewater Management Authority Act and
published the revised wastewater tariffs for 2002. Its progress toward the FY 2002/03 milestone since has
been mixed. The Wastewater Management Authority (WMA) is now fuilly staffed and operational, and the
progression and structure of the tariffs that became effective January 2000 is in accordance with the
commitments spelled out in the Sector Policy Letter for domestic tariffs and with the memorandum of
understanding, signed in 2000 between the WMA and industry, for industrial tariffs. However, the
wastewater tariff revision expected to take place in January 2003 has not yet been implemented, due to
coordination shortcomings. The planned increase in wastewater tariffs for January 2003 is expected to
result in a higher tariff for wastewater than for drinking water. Due to the joint billing system for
wastewater and drinking water, the government is reluctant to implement the new wastewater tariffs; it is
instead awaiting a study on willingness to pay for drinking water to determine drinking water pricing policy
prior to increasing wastewater tariffs. This could have an adverse fiscal impact. Separately, the government
is evaluating proposals for a feasibility study for a new landfill site and an incinerator (based on the results
of the study, the government would move forward with further analysis, particularly an environmental
impact assessment (EIA), on the Mare Chicose extension). The Bank's value added in the environment
sector has been in (i) providing advice on the financial sustainability of the sewerage sector, (ii) aiding
institutional reform of the WMA, and (iii) assisting implementation of the household connection system.
Mauritius will also benefit from two Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility grants made in 2003 to
assist the establishment of an integrated utilities regulator and pricing analysis for the water sector.
4.2.5 The government has fully met-its objective of maling a decision on the alternative mode of
transport (AMT) as part of the solution to reducing congestion in the Port Louis-Curepipe corridor. At
this early stage of decision-making the impact on the sector is expected to be modest, but the budgetary
implications could be substantially negative if expenditures on the AMT are not reconciled with other
spending priorities, given the govemment's deficit reduction strategy. Actions in the transport sector in FY
2002/03 (these do not constitute PERL milestones) include: (i) conclusion of the multiple-criteria analysis
for the AMT (in which the light rail transit, LRT, option was chosen); (ii) implementation of
complementary measures (parking policy) to ease the congestion around Port Louis; and (iii) in the port
sector, Mauritius is forging ahead to select by end-2003 a strategic partner for Cargo Handling
Corporation Ltd. The Bank's value added in transport has been in advising on the transport sector action
plan and on port policies and management.

Economic management
4.2.6 The Government of Mauritius has made headway in stabilizing the economy and partially on its
way to approving an action plan for the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The
development impact of these actions is likely to be substantial if the government stays the deficit reduction
course and successfully launches the MTEF in FY 2003/04. Prior to the PERL preparation, the
government had, (i) through the Finance Act of 2001, increased VAT from 10 percent to 12 percent; (ii)
adjusted domestic petroleum prices to reflect market rates in 2001; and (iii) created a high-level committee
to develop an MTEF suitable for Mauritius. It has since continued with strong fiscal measures in the FY
2002/03 budget: VAT has been increased to 15 percent and the management of customs is being improved.
To keep the deficit reduction strategy on track, the government will need to consolidate its gains in sectoral
policies and effectively use the MTEF mechanism to prioritize, monitor, and evaluate government policy.
The government additionally has set up a Secretariat for Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to help
Mauritius achieve its development goals and to minimize budgetary impact of needed investments-the
secretariat is developing an institutional base to assess how well potential PPP projects fit into the NEA
objectives, and the complexity of financial transactions and potential budgetary implications on a case by
case basis. Progress toward the FY 2002/03 milestones has been mixed, as follows: (i) the government
included three-year projections for its macroeconomic framework in the FY 2002/03 budget, ahead of the
FY 2002/03 milestone; (ii) an MTEF action plan has been developed by consultants, but needs to be
urgently approved and/or adapted by the govenmuent as little time for capacity building will remain prior to
the FY 2003/04 budget; (iii) a preliminary assessment has been made of fiscal risks and contingent
liabilities, but a strategy remains to be formnulated for their containment; (iv) an initial review of the
incentives regime has been completed; (iv) the Information and Communications Technologies Act was
passed in December 2001 establishing the regulatory infrastructure for the sector (mobile services also
were liberalized in December 2001, the ICT Authority was set up in the second half of 2002); (v) a new
procurement law is planned to be presented to the National Assembly in April 2003; (vi) the liberalization
of the telecommunications sector is complete, with fixed-line services having been liberalized in December
2002, a year ahead of schedule. The Bank's value added in this sector has been in (i) assisting in the
development and design of the MTEF and budget preparation; (ii) initiating the discussion on fiscal risk
and contingent liability management; (iii) advising the institutional set-up for PPPs (in areas including
institutional development, links to MTEF and fiscal risks, and legislation); (iv) supporting macroeconomic
coordination and modeling; (v) and discussing factors impacting competitiveness, such as high
telecommunication prices. Mauritius additionally has benefited from an IDF grant to support capacity
building under the MTEF.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Not applicable.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable.
4.5 Institutional development impact.:
4.5.1  The institutional development impact is Substantial. This assessment is based on the foundation,
set during the PERL, that seeks to enable more effective use of the country's financial and human resources
and to support implementation of the NEA. The PERL has supported a host of institutional reforms, the
most important of which is the education reform. Other reforms are ongoing, and include: (i) the
- 10-



implementation of wastewater pricing polices; (ii) operationalization of the Secretariat for Public-Private
Partnerships; (iii) an interministerial structure for the management of pension reform; and (iv) selection of a
strategic partner for Cargo Handling Corporation Ltd. The education reform is expected to have the largest
impact, and it is this that underlies the "substantial" rating, since the reform is well underway. If the
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) reform stays the course it is likely to have an equally large
impact on the development of the country, as it should contribute to improved fiscal management, better
allocation of resources, the realization of more value for public money, and better development outcomes.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
5.1.1  External factors that have had an impact on the international environrnent and on Mauritius include
the tragic events of September 11, 2001 in the United States, the political crisis in Madagascar, and
Cyclone Dina in January 2002. The terrorist attacks in the United States had a dampening effect on tourism
growth, although the country's good reputation for social stability prevented a downturn in the sector, the
Madagascar crisis adversely affected the textile sector; and Cyclone Dina had an adverse impact on the
sugar crop and on overall GDP growth. These developments contributed to lower imports than anticipated
and consequently to a smaller increase in tax revenues. Nevertheless, the budget outturn was better than
expected (see Section 4.1.5).
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
5.2.1  The satisfactory implementation of the first-year reform package, supported by the PERL, is in
large part due to the fact that the New Economic Agenda is homegrown and is backed by a high level of
govemment commitment. Nevertheless, although the administrative capacity of the Government of
Mauritius is very good relative to that of many developing countries, it requires scaling up in view of the
high demands placed on it by the ambitious NEA. Two areas particularly need reinforcement: (a) the ability
of the government to monitor and coordinate program implementation at the central level, and (b) the
capacity of the sector ministries to focus on strategic issues. Better coordination between the Ministry of
Finance and the Ministry of Economic Development, Financial Services, and Corporate Affairs is needed
for a sound M&E system and more efficient implementation of the government program. The government
will address the problems of coordination of the central ministries and of capacity at the sector ministries in
the context of the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF).
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
5.3.1 The program was implemented by the Government of Mauritius (see Section 5.2).
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
Not applicable.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainabilzty rating:
6.1.1  The sustainability of the Government reform program is assessed as Likely. The reforms
supported by the PERL are likely to be sustained as: (i) there is significant popular support for the New
Economic Agenda; (ii) there is a high degree of ownership of the reform program on the side of
- 1 1 -



govermnent; and (iii) the reforms form part of a medium-term program that is proceeding as envisaged (see
Annex 1, Tables A. 1.1 and A. 1.3 for FY 2002/03 allocations).
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
6.2.1 The implementation of Mauritius' reform agenda is continuing in the FY 2002/03 budget year. The
Govemment of Mauritius is reinforcing its institutional structure to implement the NEA by introducing the
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF).
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. Lending:
7.1.1 Lending is assessed as Satisfactory. The World Bank responded to the request of the Government
of Mauritius for support of its New Economic Agenda by: (i) structuring the new Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) around the NEA, (ii) providing requested advisory services, and (iii) rapidly processing the
Public Expenditure Reform Loan (PERL) (see Annex 8).
7.2 Supervision:
7.2.1. Supervision is assessed as Satisfactory. The supervision of the PERL was intensive and
continuous. Dialogue in some areas, such as environment, pensions (Mauritius: Modernizing an Advanced
Pension System 2000/01), transport, and the financial sector had begun before the PERL was
conceptualized, enabling the development of a track record and trust. After the PERL was approved on
May 7, 2002, several missions visited Mauritius, drawing on a wide range of Bank resources. The missions
provided advice (see Section 4.2) in the focus areas of the PERL and additionally on labor, corporate
governance, publicprivate partnerships, and health. A systematic and close contact has been developed with
several govermment ministries. Much of the supervision work and advisory services of the Bank is being
presented in including Mauritius: Country Procurement Assessment Review (completed 2001/02), a Public
Expenditure Review (scheduled 2002/03), an Education Sector Note (scheduled 2002/03), a Transport
Sector Action Plan (scheduled 2002/03), and a Labor Market Review (scheduled for 2003/04). The entire
country team budget was committed in support of the PERL activities, but there was a lack of additional
funding to accommodate the requests for new or extended advisory services, (for example, in the areas of
public-private partnerships and health) that developed as the NEA was being further refined.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
7.3.1  The Bank's overall performance is assessed as Satisfactory. The Bank adequately supported
Mauritius through its new Country Assistance Strategy; in addition, the timeliness and flexibility of the
PERL operation matched the client's needs, as did the core advisory services that were rendered under
supervision.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
7.4.1  Preparation is assessed as Satisfactory. The Government of Mauritius developed the NEA in
response to challenges facing the country. The NEA is ambitious, comprehensive, and addresses the most
critical priorities in Mauritius. The government's contribution to the preparation the PERL included (i)
extensive elaboration of the reform program to Bank staff, (ii) development of performance indicators, and
- 12 -



(iii) engagement in open discussion on public finance and economic management issues.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
7.5.1 Implementation is assessed as Satisfactory. The Govermnent of Mauritius stayed largely on track
in the implementation of its reform agenda in FY 2001/02, and has already made considerable progress in
the attainment of the FY 2002/03 milestones in education and economic management (see Annex 1, Table
A.1.3). This remains an overarching achievement
7.6 Implementing Agency:
7.6.1 The program was implemented by the Government of Mauritius (see Section 7.5).
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
7.7.1 Overall borrower performance is assessed as Satisfactory. The overall program is on track, and
shows a high level of ownership and commitment that should assure its sustainability. However, the pace of
reform has been slower than expected due to internal and external factors.
8. Lessons Learned
8.1    Support to homegrown programs builds trust. The reform program was designed by the
Govemment of Mauritius, and is based on an agenda that has wide political support. The Bank engaged in
discussions with the govermnent as the NEA, the new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), and the PERL
were being developed. This interactive process built trust, which has been critical in developing even closer
collaboration on challenging policy issues.
8.2    Program support operations are require clear government objectives to be effective. World
Bank advisory assistance was most effective where the government had taken early decisions and defined
its short- and medium-term objectives (for example, in education, pensions, and in terms of the
macroeconomic framework). Forward-looking analytical work by govemment, other donors, and the Bank
has been important in setting the stage. In areas where policy decisions remain to be taken (such as social
assistance), the Bank has been less effective.
8.3    Upfront actions by government ensured rapid disbursement The PERL was designed to
disburse against actions already taken, and it did so immediately upon effectiveness, giving timely support
to the FY 2001/02 budget. This avoided the disbursement delays typically associated with the filfillment
of conditionalities, and circumvented the delays that might otherwise have been caused by parallel Bank
disbursement procedures for projects.
8.4    Program support operations (PERLs or (PRSCs)) face trade-offs between focus and
responsiveness. The PERL provided the route by which the Bank could offer as much technical assistance
as possible to support the NEA. However, being responsive to government needs comes at a cost to
maintaining focus and depth. The Bank and Govemment are leaming to balance focus and responsiveness
by doing joint prioritization and planning of advisory services needs. An complementary approach is to
define just one or two flagship areas of in-depth assistance and to limit just-in-time advice to a few sectors
only.
8.5    Program support operations (PERLs or PRSCs) require innovation in program management
practices. Shifting the majority of internal resources from investment project management to medium term
- 13-



program support and advisory services requires the Bank to assure that funding for advisory services is
consistent and that the quality and impact of those services is assessed. One way to assure quality is to
establish periodic internal reviews for policy advice.
8.6    The CAS matrix has been a useful monitoring and eviauation instrument. Mauritius has a
broad reform agenda and has not yet adopted a culture of monitoring and evaluation of program
performance. It is in the process of developing a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) to fill
that gap. The government-led exercise of preparing a CAS policy matrix that fits with the intended outputs
and outcomes of the far-reaching NEA has been a useful exercise for the central government ministries, and
for the Bank.

Additional Annex 8. Beneficiary Survey Results
A two-fold approach was taken to obtain feedback from the Government of Mauritius about the
effectiveness of the PERL in addressing the country's developmental needs and in meeting expectations
regarding the implementation of the NEA. First, individual meetings were held with key political
leaders-the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, the Minister for Economic Development,
Financial Services, and Corporate Affairs, and the Minister of Education and Research-to determine their
experience with the PERL. Second, an extended forum was held with the Permanent Secretaries and senior
staff of those ministries engaged in the areas of focus of the PERL; i.e., in human development,
environment and transport, and economic management. These ministries included Finance; Economic
Development, Financial Services, and Corporate Affairs; Education and Research; Productivity and Skills
Development; Public Utilities; Public Infrastructure; Environment; Social Security, National Solidarity,
and Senior Citizens' Welfare; and Health. The two-fold approach produced the following findings:
*      The PERL was speedy. The quick-disbursing nature of the operation allowed Bank financing to be
used at the pace that Mauritius needed it. Project financing, had it been used, would likely have entailed
delays due to Bank procurement procedures that would have to be satisfied over and above those of the
Government of Mauritius.
*      Advisory services that accompanied the PERL were highly valued. The advisory services that
were provided were found to be timely, coinciding with the governnent's implementation schedules, and the
advice given was on target in addressing the following government priorities: (i) pressing concerns, (ii)
analytical issues, (iii) capacity building, and (iv) strategic choices. Analytical services met at least one of
these four priorities in each of the following areas: education reform, pensions reform and Pension Reform
Simulation Toolkit training, welfare system assessment, MTEF development, fiscal risk, and
public-private partnerships.
*      The PERL experience did not interfere with government work. Past govemment experience
suggested that had project implementation units been set up in all areas of Bank assistance, under separate
loans, this would have stifled public administration. The experience of Mauritius was that timing Bank
advice to the pace of Government requests served to alleviate the implementation bottlenecks in government
programs.
*      Development and monitoring of the CAS matrix. Development of the matrix was a fruitful
experience, providing lessons in coordination across ministries and sectors that would be needed in the
development and implementation of the MTEF. The culture of monitoring and evaluation has not yet
permeated the public administration culture in Mauritius, with the result that the monitoring of indicators
under the CAS/PERL experience has had a demonstrative impact. Mauritius is designing its MTEF with a
strong results-based management component.
*      The PERL reinforces the needfor improvement. The Government of Mauritius did not receive

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ON A
PUBLIC EXPENDITURE REFORM LOAN (PERL)
IN THE AMOUNT OF US$ 40 MILLION
TO THE
REPUBLIC OF MAURITIUS
March 27, 2003
MAURITIUS
Public Expenditure Reform Loan
Introduction
The new Government, which assumed office in September 2000, took the initiative to
assess the challenges facing the Mauritian economy and prepare an Economic Agenda for the
New Millennium (NEA). The agenda aims at achieving a quantum leap into the next phase of
the economic development of Mauritius through the promotion of high-tech high-income
services.
The focus of the NEA is on:
*     Improving competitiveness and productivity;
*     Investing in people and society;
*     Modernizing the country's economic management; and
*     Preserving and protecting Mauritius' fragile environment.
To implement the NEA, Government sought the assistance of the World Bank which
developed a three-year Country Assistance Strategy, the 2002-04 CAS. The Bank proposed a
series of three Public Expenditure Reform Loans (PERLs) to support the reform programme
envisaged by the Government. The PERL constituted a move away from project assistance to
budgetary support, linked to specific achievements in selected areas. An integral component of
the operation has been the extension of knowledge assistance.
A first tranche of US$ 40 million was disbursed in June 2002. This was based on
achievements, particularly in the areas of economic management, education, health,
environment, transport, social security and poverty alleviation and on measures taken in
2001-02 Budget that kick-started the reform process announced in the NEA. Technical
assistance has also been provided in various targeted sectors.

3.    Assessment off Development Objective and Design, and of Quality of Entry
3.1 Original Objective
The Public Expenditure Reform Loan (PERL) aims at assisting the Govemment of
Mauritius in implementing and sustaining its reform programme as spelt out in the New
Economic Agenda (NEA). It envisages the financing of policy reforms and the complementary
public finance reform which seek to (i) increase competitiveness and productivity, (ii) improve
social development and cohesion in sectors like education, training, poverty alleviation, and
health, (iii) protect and preserve the environment, and  (iv) improve economic
management.

3.1   Revised Objective
The above-mentioned objective has not been amended.
3.2   Original Components
First Tranche: US$ 40 million
The World Bank agreed to a maximum of one PERL per year of about US$ 40 million
for the three year CAS period. In the "high-case", three lending operations would be carried
out. However, should project implementation be slower, two umbrella operations would be
opted for by Government.
With the assistance of the World Bank, Government has set out the
objectives/intended outcomes in each of the defined areas of the reform programme, and has
worked out specific action plans, starting from financial year 2002-03. These are summarised
in Annex I - Mauritius CAS Matrix 2002-04, which also provides an updated assessment of
the progress achieved.
3.3   Revised Components
The components were not revised.
3.4   Quality at Entry
The Government's 5-year reform programme embodied in the NEA was commended by
the World Bank for its strengths and soundness. The likelihood of success of the reform
programme was based on its high degree of local ownership which ensured commitment and
participation of the parties involved.
The programme has set quite clear objectives. Several actions in line with the policy
objectives of Government had already been initiated under the 2001-02 Budget. During
negotiations with the World Bank for PERL, consultations were held with all stakeholders on
an agreed plan of action for Govemment.
In view of the commitment of all stakeholders to work towards a programme structure
and to achieve the objectives earmarked, the quality of the PERL project was satisfactory. No
delays were thus encountered in the disbursement of the first tranche of the PERL.
3.5   Quality of the Design
The overall design of the reform programme combines internationally recognised
concepts. However, it is considered that implementation of the reform programme was spread
over a number of sectors.
The Memorandum of the President (MOP) Risk Assessment (2002)
The MOP identified three main risks at project entry relating to the proposed operation
of the reform programme. These were, namely, insufficient political support, un-sustainability of
the macroeconomic targets and potential capacity constraints in the public sector.
Commitment towards the reform programme from Government and the participating
agencies has remained strong. Most of the macroeconomic targets are expected to be met.
However, manpower, administrative and procedural constraints have been the cause of some
delays in the implementation of projects in some sectors.
Overall, the identified risks are perceived as manageable. Measures to mitigate any
-49 -



further risks will continue to be among Govemment's top priorities so that the implementation
of the reform programme is not hindered.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/Achievement of Objective
The PERL outcomes for financial year 2002-03 have been satisfactory. Significant
progress has been made in the programme benchmarks in all sectors.
4.2 Outputs by Components
The progress achieved so far on the various reforms plans scheduled for 2002-03 is
outlined in Annex II.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return
Not Applicable.
4.4 Financial Rate of Return
Not Applicable.
4.5 Institutional Development Impact
Institutional development impact as a result of the implementation of the reform
programme is satisfactory. With CAS/PERL, Mauritius has benefited from knowledge
assistance from the World Bank in various sectors, in particular, education and training,
pension, transport as well as macroeconomic management and budget reform.
The implementation of the NEA has led to the creation of several new institutions like
the Information and Communication Technology Authority (ICTA) and the Wastewater
Management Authority (WMA). The promotion of new legislations like the Tourism Act, the ICT
Act and the new Mauritius Freeport Authority (MFA) Act has helped to create an environment
conducive for economic and institutional development.
5. Major Factors affecting Implementation and Outcome
The outcome for financial year 2002-03 is assessed to be satisfactory, with most of the
objectives set out being achieved. However, some difficulties have been encountered during
the implementation programme which were largely outside the control of Govemment and
implementing agencies.
5.1 Factors outside the control of govemment or implementing agency
Some of the factors resulting in delay in the implementation of some projects are
notably:
a3    Scarcity of technical expertise: Implementation of some projects requires the
recruitment of consultants from abroad. This has to follow the usual administrative procedures
including advertisement, short-listing of applicants, invitation of tenders and selection, which
-50 -



result in an unavoidable delay in the implementation programme.
*     Necessity to conduct studies: Implementation of some projects requires the conduct of
preliminary studies, the holding of consultations with stakeholders and the observance of
various other procedures.
5.2 Factors generally subject to govemment control
Mauritius has maintained a sound macroeconomic framework during financial year
2002-03. There has been no lack in commitment affecting project implementation.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control
*     The interdependence between Ministries has in some cases led to delay in the
execution of some projects. For instance, land acquisition procedures somewhat delayed the
construction of state secondary schools during 2001-02. These were countered through close
project monitoring and co-ordination at the Ministerial level.
*     The need to implement several priority projects concurrently resulted in some
bottlenecks in terms of capacity constraints at the levels of some sectors.
5.4 Costs and financing
No significant changes in costs have occurred.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for Sustainability Rating
Sustainability of the Government's reform programme is assessed as likely.
Government has already taken key actions to implement the NEA and is committed to
maintaining the momentum for reform. Regular meetings at Ministerial levels are held to
ensure timely implementation of projects and the reform programme. Follow up by the central
Ministries is also an important monitoring mechanism to ensure overall progress in the
implementation of the NEA.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending
Bank's performance is considered to be satisfactory during the various stages of the
lending operation, starting from preliminary assessment and project preparation to appraisal
and negotiation. This operation further consolidated the excellent relation existing between the
Bank and the borrower, the more so, as the reform programme had already been chartered out
by the borrower. The loan was approved by the Board of the Bank in a record time and
disbursement was effected as scheduled. The operation was also appreciated in view of'the
knowledge assistance that it brought in specific sectors.
7.2 Supervision
Constant bank supervision has been maintained throughout the preparation of PERL
and during the first year of implementation of the reforms. The Ministry of Finance/Economic
Development had been maintaining regular contacts with the World Bank staff and providing
them with updates on the progress of PERL. Several World Bank missions have visited
Mauritius in connection with PERL. During the last World Bank visit in January 2003, the
-51 -



experts held a meeting with the project participants to review progress on the implementation
of the CAS.
7.3 Overall Bank Performance
Overall Bank performance is assessed as satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation
Overall borrower performance is considered to be satisfactory. The necessary data,
documentation and analysis were provided to the Bank staff on a timely basis to enable
assessment and preparation of the project. Govemment Officials also worked in close
collaboration with the World Bank to finalise the implementation plan specified in the CAS.
Loan negotiations were held in a cordial atmosphere.
7.5 Govemment Implementation Performance
Government's commitment to implement the reform programme has been strong and
stakeholders involved have undertaken every necessary effort to implement the tasks planned
for the financial year 2002-03.
7.6 Implementing Agency
Performance of the implementing agencies has been satisfactory, despite the fact that
some of them had to reckon with capacity constraints.
7.7 Overall Borrower Performance
Overall borrower performance is considered to be satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learnt
a     In general, the experience of Mauritius with PERL has been positive. PERL provided a
boost to Government to undertake timely reform measures and to commit to a plan of action
which aims at steering the economy on a higher growth path. The implementation of these
reform measures would not have been feasible without the technical assistance from the
World Bank.
a     As the NEA is a totally owned reform programme, it has mustered a high degree of
commitment from Government and implementing agencies for its implementation.
a     PERL has fostered a higher degree of co-ordination between sector and central
Ministries as well as between central Ministries themselves. This is considered to be one of the
key factors in the successful implementation of the reform programme to date.
a     Budgetary support helps to accelerate the implementation of projects since access to
funds through the budget is more direct and easier. Extension of targeted budgetary support
has the added advantage of increasing transparency within the budget systems.
o     Technical assistance and the Bank's expert advice on economic/policy issues under
the CAS were of high quality. The Bank assisted in undertaking several review exercises (e.g.
Assessment of fiscal risks, Procurement Assessment Review, Education Sector Note, etc.)
which helped in defining policy measures.
o     With regard to macro economic management, PERL has contributed to the
improvement of the state of public finances.

*     Containment of contingent liabilities, as a measure to guard against fiscal risks, has
also been put on Government's agenda with PERL. In this context, Govemment is carrying out
an analysis of the risks emerging from contingent liabilities of Government with a view to
coming out with a strategy for their containment.
