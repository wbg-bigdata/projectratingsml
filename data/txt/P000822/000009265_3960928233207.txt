MEMORANDUM AND RECOIMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA
FOR A WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of The Gambia for SDR 5.4 million
(US$7.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms, with 40 years' maturity, and would help
finance a Women in Development (WID) project. The project would be
cofinanced by Norway, the African Development Bank, UNDP, UNIFEM and UNFPA.
2.        Background.  The Gambia. with a per capita income of US$220, is
one of Africa's poorest countries. Given the relative lack of natural
resources, the country's long-term development prospects depend largely on
the extent to which its human resources can be used more efficiently and on
how quickly the high population growth rate (3.3? p.a.' can be reduced.
Success in both areas depends, in turn, on enhancing the contribution of
women to the development process. The main constraints Gambian women face
ares (a) limited access to productive resources, particularly agricultural
inputs and information; (b) relatively lower levels of educational
attainment and more limited training opportunities than their male
counterparts; (c) the heavy burden of high fertility, exacerbated by poor
maternal health and nutritional status; (d) prevailing attitudes of society
concerning women's needs, abilities and socio-economic role, which reduce
their status and mobility; and (e) women's perception of themselves,
combined with a lack of knowledge concerning both their rights and the
resiurces potentially available to them.
3.        In 1980 the Government established the Nacional Women's Council
and Women's Bureau to advise the Government on women's issues. The
Government's commitment to improving the status of women is demonstrated
through the direct and personal involvement of the President, who also
serves as the Minister for Women's Affairs. In 1987, with the assistance
of IDA and other donors, the Government prepared a comprehensive women in
development strategy based on a two-pronged approachs (a) improving women's
economic status by increasing their access to productive resources; and (b)
enhancing the status and welfare of women by increasing their access to
basic social services. The proposed project was developed in the context
of this dialogue among the Government, IDA and other interested donors. It
would be the Bank Group's first free-standing Women in Development (WID)
project.
4.        Rationale for IDA's involvement.  The Government's WID strategy
addresses women's issues adequately. Its dual purpose of directly
increasing women's productive capacity and at the same time increasing
their access to basic social services, thereby contributing to general
economic growth, is in line with IDA's country objectives. The Government



2
looks to IDA for assistance to further develop and implement this strategy.
In its sectoral lending programs, IDA is also helping to address critical
women's development issues through the Health Development Project (Cr.
1760-GM), the Enterprise Development Project (Cr. 1975-GM), and the Urban
Management and Development Project (Cr. 1443-GM). An education sector
project, which is being processed in parallel with this operation,
addresses the Issue of female enrollment and achievement in the formal
education system. There is need, however, to address women's issues within
a mor- comprehensive framework. Through the proposed project, IDA can play
a crxtical role in helping the Government to do so and to design and test
new approaches to women's issues and better coordinate donor assistance in
this field. Once these initiatives have been developed and prove
successful, they could become part of the country's sectoral programs. An
IDA free-standing WID project makes sense in The Gambia at this time,
because of the small project pipeline and consequent limited opportunity to
introduce WID components in a number of sectors in the short term, and also
because the component approach has not been fully successful in some
previous projects in The Gambia.
5.        The Gambia is particularly suited for such a novel project that
focuses on women, because (a) the Government has made a strong commitment
to address women's issues; and (b) the encouraging results of small-scale
innovative approaches, particularly by NGOs active in the country, merit
replication.
6.        Project obiectives.  The proposed project aims to (a) improve
women's productivity and income-earning potential; (b) improve women's
welfare and status; (c) strengthen government institutions to enable them
to better deal with women's issues; and td) contribute to bringing about a
change in society's perception of the role of women.
7.        Project description.  The project comprises six componentas  (a)
increasing women's aaricultural productivity and disposable income and
improving the nutritional level of women and children through the
strengthening of agricultural extension services to better serve women;
private sector input distribution; support for women's cooperative groups;
strengthening of food storage, preservat&on and nutrition extension;
improved management of small-scale post-harvest equipment; and a savings
mobilization campaign; (b) improving the skills of rural women and
promoting viable and marketable skills, organizing and strengthening
women's groups in rural areas for small business and income-generating
activities, and promoting basic literacy and numeracy skills through
training activities related to women's social and economic needs; (c)
promoting safe motherhood and strengthening family planning services
through training of village-level health workers and traditional birth
attendants in early identification and management of high-risk pregnancies;
development of an alarm and transport system at the community level to
handle medical emergencies in time; a nutrition education and micro-
nutrient supplementation program; and expansion of the community-based
contraceptive distribution system; (d) developing an information, education
and communication (IEC) strategy, with emphasis on specific needs and
concerns of women, and reinforcing ongoing educational and motivational
campaigns on agriculture, health, family planning, and nutrition;



3
(e) strengthening the capacitv of the Women's Bureau for oolicv and program
formulation, advice, awareness creation, and monitoring and evaluation uf
the impact of women's development programs through technical assistance.
training, and support for studies; and (f) establishing a Fund to be used
by NGOs, on a matching fund basis, for small projects and programs designed
to help women and children.
8. The project, to be carried out over a period of five years, provides
funds for civil works; vehicles, furniture and equipment; training;
technical assistance; credit; and incremental operating costs. The total
cost of the project is estimated at US$15.1 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$9.2 million (612). A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in The Gambia are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8457-GM
dated April 30, 1990, is also attached.
9.        Implementation.  To ensure successful implementation of the
project, particular attention has been given at the design stage to
implementation arrangements. Implementation responsibility for each
project component would rest with the executing Ministry or agency, which
would have a limited, well-defined task to undertake. Overall management
and coordination of the project would be the responsibility of a Project
Coordinating Committee (PCC), consisting of the Permanent Secretaries of
the Office of the President and the Ministries involved, and a Project
Management Unit (PMU); both the PCC and the PMU are already in place.
NGOs, many of which are already active in The Gambia, are expected to play
an important role in implementation. IDA is encouraging closer
collaboration between the Government and NGOs, and has included in the
project design a number of provisions to streamline this collaboration.
10.       Agreed actions.  Agreement was reached with the Government ont
the list of the 200 project villages; and the terms of reference for the
PCC, the Project Manager and the Deputy Project Manager. The Government
gave assurances that (a) it will make available to the participating NGOs
portions of the amount allocated to the Fund, under agreements to be
entered into between the Government and the NGOs on terms satisfactory to
IDA, and IDA will have the right to review and approve certain proi sals
for financing under the Fund; (b) the PMU positions and those of the
coordinators of the agricultural, skills development, safe motherhood and
FP, and IEC components and of the M&E officer will be filled at all times
with personnel whose qualifications and experience are satisfactory to IDA;
(c) IDA will have an opportunity to review in advance and approve training
programs for key staff under the project; (d) the Government will undertake
a mid-term evaluation of the progress of project implementation; (e) the
joint annual review of project implementation will be held not later than
April 30 of each year; (f) the Government will prepare and forward to IDA
by December 31, 1990, a strategy paper on measures to increase the impact
of its extension program on women; and (g) the Government will increase the
proportion of contact farmers who are women to 102, 15? 202, 25Z and 302,
respectively, by June 30, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995, and increase the
proportion of block demonstrations participants who are women to 152, 202



4
25Z, 30Z and 351, respectively, by the same dates. Conditions of credit
effectiveness would be (a) the appointment of a Deputy Project Manager, the
Coordinators of the agricultural, skills development, safe motherhood and
FP, and IEC components, and an M&E officer; (b) the adoption of a
satisfactory form of a standard contract between the Government and NGOs
and of a statement of government policy, satisfactory to IDA, regarding NGO
participation; and (c) the submission to IDA of details, satisfactory to
IDA, on the management and administration of the Fund for small projects
and programs, including eligibility criteria. The signing of cooperative
agreements for the collaboration required under the safe motherhood and
family planning and the IEC components would be a condition of disbursement
for expenditures made by the respective project agencies.
11.       Benefits.  Women all over The Gambia, particularly those in
rural areas, would benefit from the institutional strengthening of
organizations dealing directly with women's issues (i.e., the Women's
Bureau, the Ministries of Agriculture, Education, Health, and Local
Government). The project would help improve these institutions'
responsiveness to women's needs and create a greater awareness about
women's development issues among policy-makers; this, in turn, would
contribute to better sectoral project design over the long term. The
project coordination efforts would improve ii or-agency cooperation and
harmonization of existing women's programs. A number of project activities
would be targeted to women in 200 selected villages, with a population of
direct beneficiaries estimated at 50,000. Rural women nationwide are
expected to benefit from the improved extension services and the private
farm input distribution network. Equally, the family planning program
would benefit both rural and urban women. The entire community, in
particular children, would benefit from women's improved health and
education. Over the long term, women's enhanced role in the country's
development effort would contribute to better overall economic pe formance
and to poverty reduction.
12.       Risks.  The risks involve primarily (a) the difficult  ; in
changing society's perception of the role of women and the attitudes of
civil servants dealing with women's issues; (b) IDA's and the i..erernment's
lack of experience in preparing and implementing a project of this nature;
and (c) the difficulty of implementing a project with a multi-sect(iral
approach. Nevertheless, the Government's strong commitment to implementing
a WID project, the large-scale involvement of local professionals in
project preparation, and the planned full-scale IEC campaign included in
the project design are expected to provide a favorable climate for
successful implementation. By involving experienced NGOs, together with
technical assistance, the risk of unsatisfactory implementation would be
reduced.
13.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
