APPRAISAL OF BALIKESIR NEWSPRINT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the Balikesir newsprint project for which
the Government of Turkey has requested a Bank Loan of US$70 million. The
project would be operated by the "Balikesir Establishment", a subsidiary of
SEKA, the fully Government-owned State Enterprise for Pulp and Paper. The
project consists of a pulp mill, a paper mill, a sawmill, pollution abatement
facilities, and ancillary installations, including a housing colony, all
integrated on a site near the town of Balikesir in Weste 5n Turkey. It would
produce annually 100,000 tons of newsprint and 105,000 m of sawnwood.
Total financing required for the project is estimated at TL 3,200 million or
US$200 million equivalent, including about US$82 million foreign exchange.
ii.       The Bank Loan would be made directly and jointly to SEKA and the
Balikesir Establishment for 15 years, including 4 years of grace at an
interest rate of 8.5% p.a., plus a fee of 1.5%, to be paid to the Govern-
ment. The Government would provide 40% of the financing required for the
project in the form of equity, and the remainder would be covered through a
loan from the Turkish State Investment Bank for a term of 17 years, in-
cluding 5-1/2 years of grace at 11.5% p.a. The Bank Loan would finance
foreign expenditures for machinery and equipment, engineering, training,
management and operating assistance. The Loan would finance retroactively
foreign expenditures of about US$2.5 million expected to have been made by the
time of signing the proposed loan.
iii.      Newspaper publishing became a significant element in communication
in Turkey only after 1945 with the appearance of large nation-wide newspapers
and the evolution of advertising. Consumption of newsprint increased from
9,400 tons (0.5 kg per capita) in 1950 to 93,000 tons (2.4 kg per capita) in
1974, representing an average annual growth rate of about 10%. The dem-
ographic features of the Turkish society, a trend towards urbanization and
the Government's efforts to increase literacy levels, as well as rising
expenditures for advertising, are combining to support the expectation of
continued strong growth of newspaper readership, leading to a projected
demand for newsprint of 138,000 tons in 1979 and 188,000 tons in 1983. On the
basis of the projected domestic market and production, small exports would be
possible between 1979 and 1982, probably to Turkey's neighboring countries
along the Mediterranean and in the Middle East which are importing newsprint.
By 1983, however, Turkey once again would have to resort to importation.
SEKA, which is by far Turkey's largest enterprise in the pulp and paper
industry, is also the country's only newsprint manufacturer.
iv.      Implementation of the Balikesir project is well under way.  The
consulting firm, Sandwell of Canada, completed the feasibility study in



- ii -
January 1975 and was subsequently retained by SEKA to prepare bidding docu-
ments and detailed design. The project will utilize thermomechanical pulping
and twin-wire newsprint sheet forming, two recently developed but already
firmly-established process improvements that are expected to reduce costs and
improve paper quality. The site has been purchased and is well-suited. The
project will have only a minimal effect upon the environment and the proposed
anti-pollution controls are fully satisfactory. First orders for time criti-
cal equipment items will be placed in April and May 1976, with the sawmill
expected to start production in October 1978 and the pulp and paper mill in
January 1979. Full capacity production is expected to be achieved by 1982.
Sandwell will also provide training, project implementation and operating
assistance in the form of a field staff of 12 and other back-up services. In
light of this assistance program, the progress schedule is judged realistic.
v.        The project would use 307,000 m3 (ub) per year of wood from surround-
ing forests and would so help utilize more intensively Turkey's forest re-
sources. SEKA and the General Directorate of Forestry have executed a protocol
assuring the wood supply to the project. The Loan would be the Bank's second
operation for the development of Turkey's pulp and paper industry. In January
1974, a Bank loan of US$40 million to the Government of Turkey was approved
for the Antalya Forest Utilization Project (Loan No. 957-TU) of which US$35.1
million were on-lent to SEKA for an integrated sawmill and linerboard mill,
while US$4.9 million were to be used for the modernization of related forestry
operations. The project is about two years behind schedule because of a
decision to move its location from the original site near the town of Manavgat
in the Antalya region about 300 km to the east to a new site near the town of
Silifke. The delay has led to a significant cost overrun. The Government of
Turkey has undertaken to finance this overrun, and the project is now proceed-
ing satisfactorily.
vi.       The newsprint price in Turkey is controlled by the Government
and currently set at TL 4,500 (US$281) per ton, well below domestic production
costs and the estimated c.i.f. import price of US$430. The Government covers
SEKA's losses originating from newsprint production through budgetary alloca-
tions. This system provides no incentive for efficient operation and dis-
guises the degree of newsprint subsidy. The Government has agreed to a change
of the system under which SEKA would set the ex-factory newsprint price of
the Balikesir Establishment so as to enable the Balikesir project annually to
earn a reasonable annual return on its investment. Should the Government
decide to keep the newsprint price to the newsprint consumer below this level
because of social and political considerations, then it would pay an amount
equivalent to the difference between the price paid to the Balikesir Establish-
ment under the above formula and the price established by the Government.
This would identify the degree of newsprint subsidy and not compensate the
project for losses resulting from less than efficient operation.
vii.      The project is expected to earn a financial rate of return of 9.7%
before corporate income tax and 7.7% after tax. Its economic return, using



- iii -
international prices for traded goods, is estimated at 16.1%. The project
will directly employ only 850 people but will provide indirect employment for
up to 2,500 people through the expansion of forestry operations attributable
to the project.
viii.     Based on the agreements reached with the Government, SEKA and
the Balikesir Establishment, which are listed at the end of this report, the
project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$70 million.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Turkey has requested a Bank Loan of US$70 mil-
lion equivalent for Seluloz ve Kagit Fabrikalari Isletmesi (SEKA), its
State Enterprise for Pulp and Paper, for the construction of an integrated
sawnill and newsprint mill near the town of alikesir in Western Turkey (Map
IBRD 12192), for the production of 105,000 m p.a. of sawnwood and 100,000 tpy
of newsprint for local consumption. Total financing required for the pro-
ject, which is under way and scheduled for completion in early 1979, is
expected to be TL 3,200 million (US$ 200.0 million), including foreign
exchange of TL 1,308.2 million (US$81.7 million). The Government and the
Turkish State Investment Bank (DYB) will provide the remainder of the financ-
ing.
1.02      Turkey possesses extensive forest resources and, in terms of area,
it has the fourth largest forests in Europe. Since the early 1960s, the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has been assisting Turkey in survey-
ing these forest resources and preparing plans for more intensive utilization.
The Antalya Forest Utilization Project, which will utilize forests along the
Southern Mediterranean coast, was one of the first results of these studies.
A detailed study of the North Aegean, Marmara and Black Sea region (North
Turkey Forest Study), which is nearing completion, indicates that there are
also substantial wood resources available in that area. Using preliminary
results of this study, a prefeasibility study and subsequently a full feasi-
bility study were commissioned by UNDP, with the Food and Agriculture Organi-
zation (FAO) as executing agency, for the Balikesir newsprint project.
The feasibility study was prepared by Sandwell and Co. Ltd., consulting
engineers of Vancouver, Canada. It was completed in January 1975.
1.03      The proposed Bank Loan would be the second loan for the develop-
ment of Turkey's pulp and paper industry. In January 1974 a Bank Loan of
US$40.0 million to the Government of Turkey was approved for the Antalya
Forest Utilization Project (Loan No. 957-TU) of which US$35.1 million were
on-lent to SEKA for an integrated sawmill and pulp and paper mill for liner-
board and sackkraft, while US$4.9 million were to be used for modernization
of forestry operations in order to supply the new industrial complex with its
wood requirements (IBRD Report 240a-TU of December 17, 1973). This project,
which has been renamed the Akdeniz Project 1/, is now proceeding, but is one
and a half years behind schedule due to a decision to move, because of strong
local opposition to acquisition of the original site, its location from the
original site near the town of Manavgat in the Antalya region about 300 km to
the east to a new site near the town of Silifke (Map IBRD 12192). A Presi-
dent's memorandum (No. R 76-95) which discusses the effects of this change and
confirms the viability of the project has been distributed to the Executive
Directors on April 27, 1976.
1.04      The project was appraised in the field from mid-October to mid-
November 1975 by Messrs. G. Becher, M. Oberdorfer and A. Tarnawiecki of the
1/   "Akdeniz" (White Sea) is the Turkish name for the Mediterranean Sea.

II. THE SECTOR AND THE BORROWER
A.   Turkey's Pulp and Paper Industry
2.01      SEKA, a fully Government owned company, is by far Turkey's largest
pulp and paper enterprise. In 1974, it produced 301,000 tons of paper and
paperboard, equivalent to 83% of the total domestic production in that year.
Private sector enterprises produced 62,000 tons, and 23,000 tons were imported
for a total consumption of 386,000 tons, which during the period 1965-1974 has
grown at an annual average rate of about 10%. Over one half of the production
in the private sector comes from three larger manufacturers, including one
(Viking Kagit ve Seluloz A.S.) in which IFC invested in 1969 and 1971 a total
of about US$3.2 million (Investment Nos. 159 TU and 189 TU). The remainder of
the private sector consists of numerous small plants. Private manufacturers
use imported pulp and waste paper as raw materials.
2.02      The high capital cost associated with maximum economies of scale
in producing pulp and paper is a major deterrent for private investors.
SEKA will, therefore, continue to dominate the production of these products in
Turkey, while private sector enterprises will concentrate on converting paper
products, such as corrugated containers. The two largest private converters,
nevertheless, are currently going forward, as part of a vertical integration
program, with the construction of two small pulp and paper mills to produce
fluting and bogus linerboard from straw and waste kraft paper. The combined
capacity of these two projects will be about 55,000 tpy of paper. Limited
availability of straw and kraft waste paper is likely to discourage other
major projects of this type in the future. The existing pulp and paper
enterprises in the private sector primarily produce qualities not made by
SEKA. In those few instances where there is direct competition, the private
mills follow SEKA's prices.
B.  The Turkish Sawmill Industry
2.03      There are 17 public sector sawmills, operated by the Ministry of
Forestry, and about 5,000 private sawmills in Turkey. Most of the privately
owned mills are small with 3an estimated average capacity per mill in terms of
roundwood input of 1,200 m  yer year, whereas the public sector mills have an
average capacity of 25,000 m per year. In the small private mills, capital
investment is low, and generally all activities except operation of tVe band
saw are carried out manually. In developed countries, about 30,000 m per



-3-
year is currently regarded as the minimum level of output required to make
a unit economically viable.  The 3two sawmills that will be built as pirt of
the Balikesir project (105,000 m ) and the Akdeniz project (170,000 m ) will
be the first to be operated by SEKA. They will be the largest sawmills in
Turkey.
C.   SEKA
1. History and Organization
2.04      SEKA was established as a State Economic Enterprise in 1955, with
its head office and plant in Izmit. 1/ Its authorized share capital, fully
Government owned, is currently TL 2.6 billion. It employs about 10,000
people. Until 1970, Izmit, which produces various kinds of pulp and paper
from wood and straw, was SEKA's only plant. In 1970, 1971 and 1972, construc-
tion of three new plants (Caycuma, Aksu, Dalaman), one in each year, was
completed. Each of them is organized as a subsidiary of SEKA. Now three
more projects (Afyon, Akdeniz and Balikesir) are under implementation, and
each of these projects is also organized as a subsidiary of SEKA. The Afyon
project, a reed and straw pulp mill in Central Turkey, is expected to be
completed in 1977. The Akdeniz project is scheduled for completion in late
1978, and the Balikesir project in early 1979. The location of SEKA's exist-
ing plants and of the three projects now under implementation is shown in
Map IBRD 12192. Their production facilities, main raw materials, employ-
ment, and future expansion plans are described in Annex 2-1. Since the North
Turkey Study has established that there still are significant unused wood
resources available in Northern Turkey, the UNDP is currently financing
a study of the potential of expanding SEKA's existing mills in Northern
Turkey and/or of establishing new ones, such as a new bleached kraft pulp
mill. Sandwell and Co. are executing the study which will be completed in
mid 1977.
2.05      SEKA's past and future production by plants and major products is
given in Annex 2-2. It shows the rapid increase in SEKA's paper and paper-
board production from about 100,000 tons in 1966 to about 300,000 tons in 1975
and a planned 540,000 tons in 1980. Starting up three new plants in as many
consecutive years was a difficult task for SEKA and would have been so for any
manufacturer undergoing such a rapid expansion program. The three new plants
did indeed face start-up difficulties, but these are gradually being overcome,
and the Caycuma plant reached 96% of capacity utilization in 1975, the Aksu
plant 86% and the Dalaman plant 93%. The Izmit plant operated at full capa-
city. The shortage of trained and experienced personnel in Turkey has been
1/   Prior to 1955, the production facilities taken over by SEKA had
belonged to the Government-owned Sumerbank.

a problem for SEKA. Turkish law, applying to all State Economic Enterprises
regulates salaries, but SEKA can arrange for special contracts if it needs
to compete with the private sector in attracting and retaining sufficient high
caliber technical and management talent for key positions. SEKA fully recog-
nizes the importance of having competent staff, and one measure that it has
taken is to send promising young students abroad to institutions of higher
learning. Upon graduation, these students are required to work for SEKA until
the debt for their education has been repaid. More important, however, is
that while in the past SEKA has been relying only on equipment manufac-
turers for start-up assistance, it now has made provisions in the implemen-
tation program of the Akdeniz and Balikesir projects for expatriate training,
operating and management assistance from its consulting engineers. Shortage
of experienced staff is, therefore, not endangering the benefits of these
projects. The details of the assistance program for the Balikesir project are
discussed below (para. 4.12).
2.06      SEKA has a Board of Directors with six members.  The Chairman
is also SEKA's General Manager, and his two Assistant General Managers (one
for Finance and Administration, the other for Production and Technical Matters)
are also Board members. They are appointed by the Council of Ministers. The
other three Board members are one representative each from the Ministry of
Industry and Technology, from the Ministry of Finance and from the labor
unions. The Board meets frequently and exercises close control over SEKA's
operations. SEKA's General Manager and Assistant General Managers also
exercise the function of managers for the Izmit plant, still SEKA's largest
mill accounting for about 40% of total output by volume. Each of SEKA's six
subsidiaries has its own legal personality, incorporated under Turkish law,
but their autonomy from the Izmit head office is limited, especially in
financial matters, and this is spelled out in detail in SEKA's rules and
regulations. Therefore, in accordance with the official translation of
the applicable Turkish law, the term "Establishment" is used to describe
SEKA's subsidiaries. On balance, the effect of the close control exercised by
the senior management of the head office is positive, but in the longer
run, as SEKA. expands further and the management of the Establishments gain
further experience, continued close control could adversely effect operational
efficiency. SEKA's management foresees that eventually the head office will
be separated from the Izmit plant and transferred to Ankara. The Izmit
plant would then also become a subsidiary of SEKA, and the head office would
limit itself to overall planning and control. SEKA's organization chart is
shown in Annex 2-3.
2.   Newsprint Production Capacity
2.07      SEKA is Turkey's only newsprint manufacturer.  Initially, the Izmit
plant had the only facilities for making newsprint, and domestic production
stagnated between 10,000 and 20,000 tpy until 1971, when SEKA's Aksu plant
with a design capacity for 82,500 tpy of newsprint came on stream. Imports in
1970 had reached 66,000 tons. Bv 1972, the Aksu and Izmit plants together
were able to produce enough newsprint to eliminate imports. The Aksu plant
has so far produced at less than 90% of design capacity, and it is expected
that it will take some time before full production will be reached. Among the



- 5 -
reasons, besides inexperience of staff (para. 2.05), are delivery of over-
mature and dry wood and power outages. Mechanical pulp from over-mature wood
has low yield and poor strength characteristics. The General Directorate
of Forestry (GDF) is trying to deliver wood from younger trees to the Aksu
plant, but this problem can only be solved gradually as the forests are
cleared of over-mature trees and stocked with younger age classes. In order
to prevent drying of the wood after cutting, which again reduces yield, SEKA
and the GDF are jointly taking measures to better schedule wood haulage from
forest roadsides to the mill. Wood transport is entirely handled by con-
tractor-owned trucks, and during harvest seasons SEKA has found it difficult
to engage sufficient trucks, and has had to hold larger wood inventories.
This is still considered more economical than the purchase of trucks by SEKA.
There is little that SEKA can do about power outages, since self-generation of
power cannot be justified. However, the performance of the Turkish Electri-
city Authority (TEK), which has a history of voltage and frequency variations,
is generally expected to improve through the expansion of its generating
capacity more rapidly than its expected load growth, and the extension of its
interconnected transmission system, and other measures to be undertaken.l/
2.08      The Izmit mill, though capable of producing newsprint, is not
designed for that purpose, and it is expected that the facilities of Izmit
will be reverted to their intended use for other writing and printing paper
grades as soon as sufficient newsprint capacity becomes available from the
Balikesir project.
3. Financial Position
2.09      SEKA's financial position, is discussed in Annex 2-4, and a few in-
dicators of its consolidated financial statements for the years 1971 to 1975
are summarized below:
1/   The problems faced by TEK and measures undertaken to solve them are
described in IBRD Report No. 679a-TU, which projects a faster growth
for expansion of TEK's generating capacity than for maximum power demand.

2.10      As evidenced in the table above, SEKA's financial results and
liquidity position have been poor in the years 1971 to 1973, but this perfor-
mance must be seen in the light of the start-up of three new plants, which
resulted in a low average capacity utilization in 1971 and 1972, and poor
financial results. The year 1974 showed good overall results and can be
considered as the year in which SEKA had mastered its first wave of expansion
projects. The year 1975 was expected to show equally good results. However,
during 1975, SEKA had some significant cost increases as a result of the
high rate of inflation in Turkey. On July 1, 1975, new labor rates became
effective which represented an increase in labor costs of 108%. SEKA has not
yet adjusted the prices of its products to reflect these cost increases.
According to the law pertaining to SEKA, SEKA is free to determine the prices
of its products, except for newsprint which has been declared a "basic commo-
dity" by the Government and for which the Government determines the price.
In reality, however, even with regard to its other products,  SEKA is not
completely free to set the prices and has to solicit the opinion of the
Government prior to introducing price increases.  This subjects SEKA to
Government interests other than those purely related to SEKA, such as the
Government's current policy to reduce Turkey's rate of inflation.  Because of
this policy, the Government at this moment is hesitant to permit price adjust-
ments by SEKA to the new cost levels, and this "unofficial" government control
over SEKA's product prices makes it difficult to project SEKA's cash generation
and financial position. However, since SEKA is fully Government owned, any
restriction through price control on its potential for cash generation must be
offset by the Government through an increased infusion of capital in the form
of equity or loans.



III. THE MARKET
A.   Newsprint
1.   The Turkish Newspaper Industry
3.01      Newspaper publishing became a significant element in communica-
tion in Turkey only after 1945. The four major publishing groups,
which now account for about 70% of total newsprint consumption, were all
founded after 1948. The remaining 30% of Turkey's newsprint consumption is
shared by numerous small publishers, most of whom use less than 500 tons of
newsprint per year. The four main newspapers, with a circulation of more
than 300,000 each, are published in Istanbul, but all have satellite printing
facilities in the other three main cities: Ankara, Adana and Izmir. All
the large papers have their own distribution systems including truck fleets
that ensure that normally these "national" papers reach all towns even in
Eastern Turkey the same day they are published. Newspapers are sold mainly
through newsstands (or in small shops) and less than 1% through subscriptions.
This system results in a high proportion, estimated at 15%, of newspapers
returned unsold. However, unsold newspapers find a ready market as waste
paper. At present the newsstand price of the major papers is TL 1.5 per
copy. This is relatively high in terms of Turkish incomes and the limited
number of pages in each newspaper (12 to 14 pages for major papers) and yet
circulation revenues are judged not to reach even half of the newspaper
production costs. Advertising revenues provide the principal income.
2.  Newsprint Demand Projection
3.02      Twenty-five years ago, consumption of newsprint in Turkey was only
9,400 tons annually or less than 0.5 kg per capita. However, since then news-
print consumption has increased on the average by 10% per year, and by an
average of 11% since 1961, reaching a volume of 93,000 tons in 1974, or 2.4
kg per capita. For Turkey, at its level of per capita income, this is a
fairly high consumption and few developing countries exceed this level. The
newsprint consumption of some representative countries is shown in Annex 3-1,
and past production, imports and consumption of newsprint in Turkey are shown
in Annex 3-2.
3.03      The consumption of newspapers is influenced by a number of factors,
but the most important one is a large, literate urban population. Turkey now
has an adult literacy of about 50%, and the Government is making strong
efforts to improve literacy standards and provide advanced education. Turkey
continues to be a predominantly rural society since about 65% of its population
resides in communities of less than 10,000 persons, but there is a distinct
trend toward urbanization, and the urban population is growing much faster
than the rural population. Demographic features of the Turkish society, there-
fore, combine to support the expectation of continued strong growth of news-
paper consumption. Increased circulation is only one stimulus to newsprint
consumption. The other is increased size of newspapers, but this is only



-8-
possible if an acceptable balance is maintained between editorial and adver-
tising content. Since the trend in Turkey is towards increased advertising
expenditures, this too supports the expectation of growing newsprint consump-
tion. However, the rapid growth registered in the past 25 years, brought
about by the evolution of advertising and the appearance of large nation-wide
newspapers is not expected to continue. After consideration of all factors,
including the publishers' opinion on future growth prospects, it is considered
that an average annual rate of increase of 8% represents the best judgement on
the future demand trend (as compared to the past annual growth rate of 10%).
This rate has been applied to the actual consumption of 1974 of 93,000 tons to
project the demand through 1985. The results are compared below with the
domestic production capacity. SEKA maintains that there was an unfulfilled
demand in Turkey for about 10,000 tons of newsprint in 1974. On this basis,
SEKA projects the 1976 demand to be 120,000 tons rather than 110,000 tons as
shown below.

3.04      Small surpluses of up to about 7% of projected demand are possible
during the years 1979 through 1982, but the export of such surpluses should
not present difficulties since Turkey has neighboring countries that import
small quantities of newsprint, as shown in the following table.



These are countries where the important newsprint exporters are not
strongly interested because of the small size of the markets. Of the
countries involved, only Iran is known to have a newsprint mill planned
(90,000 tpy capacity) with 1980 as the earliest date of completion.

3.05      The projected supply and demand balance also indicates that by
about 1983 Turkey is likely once again to have a deficit in newsprint pro-
duction. A further expansion of domestic production facilities might, there-
fore, be considered at that time. Such expansion could logically take place
either at the existing mill of Aksu or at the Balikesir mill now being im-
plemented. Assurance has been obtained from SEKA that it will discuss with
the Bank the results of the study currently undertaken by Sandwell as they
relate to newsprint production (para. 2.04).
3.   Domestic and International Newsprint Prices
3.06      Newsprint has been declared a basic commodity by the Government
(para. 2.10), and the Government has set its ex-factory price at a level below
domestic production costs so as to assist Turkey's developing newspaper
industry in making newspapers available throughout Turkey. Some newsprint is
also used for school books. The Government covers the losses of SEKA's news-
print plants.
3.07      The controlled ex-factory price applies only to newsprint produced
locally. SEKA, which is also Turkey's only authorized newsprint importer,
charges buyers a weighted average price between the controlled domestic price
and the actual cost of imported newsprint (the average price was about TL 5,000
in Istanbul at the end of 1975). Most of the world newsprint trade takes
place under long-term contracts. In the past, however, Turkey has bought
newsprint in the spot market because the small volume and the lack of con-
tinuity of her purchases did not make it attractive to large-scale export-
ers in Scandinavia or North America. In the spot market prices are subject
to wider fluctuations than in the contract market because some exporters are
willing to dump their surpluses at prices below prevalent contract prices
when world demand is low and, on the contrary, are likely to charge a premium



- 10 -
over contract prices when shortages of newsprint occur. Spot prices are not
published regularly but since 1973 they have been generally higher than
contract prices. The controlled ex-factory price for Turkish newsprint
is compared below to U.S. contract prices (f.o.b. New York) and with average
Turkish import prices (for actual import price see Annex 3-2, page 2). After
addition of freight, insurance and landing charges, the U.S. contract price of
newsprint would have been higher than the domestic ex-factory price of news-
print in Turkey in the last three years.

3.08      A review of the present and future world market for newsprint
and a discussion of international newsprint prices are contained in Annex 3-3.
Newsprint consumption in the market economy countries is projected to in-
crease between 1973 and 1979 at an average rate of 5% annually from 20.4
to 27.3 million tons. Based on projects underway and expansion of existing
capacity no serious imbalance between supply and demand is expected to
occur during this period. However, a consensus exists in the trade that
international prices will have to increase in real terms by at least 20%
over the 1975 level of about US$300 per ton f.o.b. Scandinavian port to bring
about the construction of new plants and substantial replacement of obsolete
existing facilities required to meet demand beyond 1979. Therefore a price
of US$360, f.o.b. Scandinavia, in 1975 Dollars is judged to be an appropriate
basis for economic evaluation. Freight, insurance and landing costs, which
are relatively high for newsprint rolls (the usual way in which newsprint
is traded), are estimated at US$70/ton (or about 20% of the f.o.b. price).
This leads to an estimated economic cost by the end of the present decade of
US$430 or TL 6,880 (in 1975 Dollars) per ton of newsprint, landed Turkey.



B.   Sawnwood
1. Projected Demand and Prices
3.09      The production and consumption of sawnwood in Turkey in the years
1962 through 1974 is shown in Annex 3-4. Imports and exports of sawnwood are
not significant and consumption is practically identical to domestic produc-
tion, which amounted to about 2.7 million m of sawnwood in 1974. In the past
10 years, average growth of sawnwood consumption in Turkey has been 7.5%
per year. There is no known reason at this time why this growth rate should
actually decline, but as a measure of safety it has been assumed that the
average growth in future years will be only 5% annually. This would mean an
increase in consumption between 1975 and 1982, the year when the Balikesir -
slwmill is expected to reach full production, of about 40% or about 1 million
m . The potential suppliers of this amount are the existing sawmills, none
of which have any known expansion plans, and the niw sawmills to be
built as part of SJKA's Akdeniz project (170,000 m p.a.) and the Balikesir
project (105,000 m p.a.). The Balikesir sawmill will be well located to
supply the cities of Istanbul, Izmir, and to a lesser extent, Ankara, which
constitute about one-third of Turkey's sawnwood market or an expected incre-
ment of about 360,000 m between 1975 and 1982. This indicates that there
should be no problem in the marketing of the sawnwood.
3.10      Prices for sawnwood vary considerably according to species, grade
and length as well as to the conditions of sale. Little systematic price
information is available in Turkey. The weighted average price for construc-
tion sawnwood, which will constitute most of th   output of the Balikesir mill,
has been estimated at TL 1,390 (US$86.88) per m . For the economic analysis,
quotations obtiined in mid-1975 show that border prices averaged TL 2,160
(US$135) per m for construction grade sawnwood. A more detailed discussion
of the sawnwood market in Turkey and the domestic and import prices for sawn-
wood is in Annex 3-5.
2.   Distribution and Selling Methods
3.11      A description of the current distribution and selling methods in
the sawnilling industry is contained in Annex 3-6. These procedures are
cumbersome, requiring visits by buyers to the sawmills to inspect the mer-
chandise and participate in suctioning.  In the case of the Balikesir mill
which will sell some 8,750 m of sawnwood each month, much more than the
quantities currently being sold by any sawmill, these methods would not be
feasible. In conniction with the Akdeniz project which also comprises a
sawmill (170,000 m p.a.) SEKA had, therefore, requested its consultants
Sandwell, to prepare a detailed study of the existing system and pro-
pose new selling and distribution methods. This study was completed in



- 12 -
May 1975. Its main recommendations (Annex 3-6) are that (i) sawnwood prices
would be set by SEKA in a published price list which would be amended from
time to time to reflect changing market conditions and which would also offer
a variety of credit terms; (ii) SEKA would establish regional selling offices
in Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir and Adana (or Mersin); and (iii) buyers would be
encouraged to permit SEKA to arrange transportation to facilitate an orderly
flow of sawnwood from the mill. Assurances were obtained that, by end of
1978, SEKA will establish a sawnwood selling and distribution system sub-
stantially in accordance with these recommendations.
IV.   THE PROJECT
A.   Project Scope
4.01      The project consists of a wood preparation plant, a sawmill, a pulp
mill, a paper mill, pollution abatement facilities and ancillary facilities,
all integrated on a site near the town of Balikesir, about halfway between
Istanbul and Izmir. The pulp mill will have a capacity to produce about
80,000 tpy (bone dry) of thermomechanical pulp, all to be used in the paper
mill, together with 14,000 tpy (bone dry) of imported semi-bleached chemical
pulp, for the production of lOO,9O0 tpy of newsprint. The sawmill will
produce for sale3about 105,000 m per year of air dried sawnwood, and will
deliver 97,000 m  annually of wood'residue (including sawdust) to the pulp
mill. The integrated complex will consume 221,000 m (ub) per year of saw-
logs, and 86,000 m (ub) per year of pulplogs which will be converted in the
wood preparation plant into chips for the pulp mill. Ancillary facilities
will include a power plant and a housing colony for 1,000 people. The project
also includes consultant services.
4.02      The primary objectives of this project are to provide for Turkey's
growing need for newsprint to support an expanding newspaper industry and to
make more intensive use of the available forest resources. An integrated mill
was chosen to permit processing sawlogs that would be extracted from the
forests at the same time as pulplogs so that sawmilling residues could be
directly utilized as pulpwood. The appropriate newsprint capacity has been
established at 100,000 tpy, well within the available raw material and the
market potential. There are larger newsprint machines operating in industria-
lized countries, but in the light of the less than satisfactory performance of
SEKA's existing newsprint mill at Aksu, it is judged that the selected size is
around the upper limit of SEKA's capability with adequate training and expat-
riate assistance in operation and management. Further details on the produc-
tion capacity of the project are presented in Annex 4-1.
B. Wood Supply
4.03      The five Forest Conservancies closest to the project (Balikesir,
Canakkale, Izmir, Bursa and Eskisehir) will supply the wood requirements of
the project (Map IBRD 12192). Sufficient wood is available in these
conservancies to meet current demand plus that of the project, even without



- 13 -
more intensive forest utilization. The project will take about 25% of the
area's current annual allowable cut. The average hauling distance to the
mill will be about 165 km with all wood transported to the plant by contractor-
owned trucks. The forest resources in the five conservancies and the cost of
sawlogs and pulplogs delivered to the Balikesir project are discussed in Annex
4-2.
4.04      In 1975 SEKA and the General Directorate of Forestry (GDF) signed a
protocol specifying the basis for determining the cost and quantity of wood to
be supplied by GDF to the project. The price (delivered roadside) of sawlogs
will be based on the average public auction price for the preceding six months
in the five conservancies, and the price of pulpwood will be established
annually in accordance with GDF regulations which provide for a price based on
direct production costs plus an allocated overhead cost and a fixed profit
allowance. The protocol between SEKA and the GDF will require certain changes
because it is likely that as a result of the North Turkey Forest Study,
expected to be completed by mid-1976, more wood can be obtained from areas
closer to the mill (para. 4.05), and because of a change in the timing of the
Balikesir project that has taken place since the protocol was signed. Assur-
ances have been obtained that SEKA will amend the protocol in a manner satis-
factory to the Bank by December 31, 1976, and will not change the protocol
thereafter without the prior approval of the Bank.
4.05      As part of the North Turkey Forest Study, forest resources were
systematically surveyed, including the five conservancies that will supply
the project. The present system of forest management was also analyzed and
changes proposed to introduce more intensive forest utilization. These are
described in Annex 4-3. The Government intends to implement the recommen-
dations of the study and invest an estimated US$20 million equivalent in
Turkey's fifteen northern forest conservancies of which about US$6.8 million
will be invested in the five conservancies that will supply the Balikesir
mill, primarily in road construction and maintenance equipment. The new
management system and the extended road network will significantly increase,
over the next five to ten years, the annual allowable cut, including the five
conservancies serving the mill. As a result, it is hoped that eventually all
pulpwood could be obtained just from the Balikesir conservancy and no pulp-
wood would be required from the remaining four conservancies, and that the
three conservancies closest to the mill site could supply the entire sawlog
requirements. This would reduce hauling costs to the mill by about 25% or
TL 7 million in 1975 prices but this reduction has not been taken into account
in the financial projections.   In addition, more intensive forest utilization
will also reduce the cost of wood per cubic meter as delivered to the roadside,
but it is not possible at this point to quantify the cost reduction. Assuran-
ces have been obtained that the Government will provide GDF with all funds and
take all actions necessary to assure the wood supply to the project, including
introduction of modern forest management techniques.
C.   Process Technology
4.06      The project will utilize two recently-developed but firmly-establi-
shed process improvements: thermomechanical pulping and twin-wire sheet
forming on the newspaper machine. These developments have important advantages
to the project, both in cost of manufacture and in improved quality. Most new



- 14 -
newsprint capacity will utilize these process improvements. All other proces-
ses used in the project are long established. The species of wood available
to the project have never been utilized in newsprint manufacture, although
similar species have been so utilized in other countries for many years.
SEKA's existing newsprint facilities use an older process and are therefore
unsuited for testing these species. The Turkish species have been tested in a
leading Canadian laboratory and in a leading American thermomechanical pilot
plant. A review of the test results shows that the species are suitable for
newsprint manufacture utilizing the proposed process. Further details on
newsprint quality and process technology are presented in Annex 4-4.
D.   Site and Related Factors
4.07      The site, which is 12 km southeast of the city of Balikesir
on the main highway to Izmir, was acquired by SEKA in 1971 for a bleached
sulphate pulp mill. This project had to be abandoned because of the asso-
ciated stream pollution and the low assimilative capacity of She only major
stream in the area which had a minimum recorded flow of 1.82 m /s in the year
prior to the start of flow regulation. A thermomechanical pulp mill requires
little water and causes no major pollution problems. The State Hydraulic
Works (DSI), which is developing surface water storage and distribution
sys ems for irrigation in the Balikesir area, has granted a pejmit to SEKA for
1 m Is, well above the project's water requirements of 0.133 m /s. A conven-
tional roundwood and sulphite chemical pulp newsprint mill would require
0.236 m /s. Groundwater is also available in the area but in quantities as
yet unknown. A 150 m deep artesian well on the plant site will provide for
the needs of the project's housing colony.
4.08      The manufacture of newsprint is energy-intensive because of the
high mechanical pulp content. Average electric power demand of the project is
estimated at 44 MW. The Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) is capable of
supplying this demand from the national grid through its Balikesir substation,
but a 12 km long high voltage transmission line (154 kv) will have to be built
by TEK. TEK has a history of voltage and frequency variations and outages
that make the operation of continuous process plants difficult, but TEK's
performance is expected to improve (para. 2.07). Nevertheless, the project
will have a non-condensing turbogenerator with a capacity of 9 MW to minimize
voltage variations and provide sufficient electric power to keep the newsprint
machine operating in the event of an outage, for one or two hours, until the
available prepared pulp is consumed. Assurances have been obtained from the
Government that it will take all action and provide all funds necessary in
order to enable TEK to build and complete by no later than July 1, 1978 the
high voltage transmission line from its Balikesir substation to the mill site
in accordance with a construction schedule agreed with the Bank.
4.09      The site is well-suited to the project and with an area of 180 ha
offers ample space for future expansion. Soil investigations have been carried
out, and the site has been found to be suitable for the erection of indus-
trial buildings supported on footings. The area has a long history of earth-
quakes, and the structures will be designed to withstand major shocks. Trans-
port for the project will be entirely by road for reasons of reliability and
fast service. The railway lies only 6 km away over favorable terrain, and a



- 15 -
connection could easily be built should this prove justified in the future.
Further details on water and electric power supply and other site related
factors are presented in Annex 4-5.
E.   Environmental Impact and Protection
4.10      The project is expected to have a minimal effect upon the environ-
ment. The principal source of air and water pollution in the pulp and
paper industry is in the manufacture of chemical pulp, which will not be
produced by this project. Water pollution in the project will come from fiber
losses and from the small part of the pulpwood (about 5%) that goes into
solution during thermomechanical pulping. The liquid effluent from the
process would be treated in a clarifier to remove suspended solids and in an
aereated lagoon to biochemically consume oxygen-depleting organic matter. The
treatment would be designed to remove 95% of both deleterious components.
Discharge would be to the receiving stream at a downstream point where the
flow is adequate to assimilate the small remaining pollution load. The
process itself would vent nothing to the atmosphere except water vapor.
The power boilers would discharge sulphur dioxide to the air in amounts
depending upon the sulphur content of the available oil, and small quantities
that might escape the fly ash separators following the burning of bark and
wood waste in the power boilers. Assurances have been obtained from SEKA
that anti-pollution controls designed to meet environmental protection stan-
dards agreed with the Bank are installed and are thereafter maintained in
good condition and properly utilized. Further details on the environmental
impact and protection are presented in Annex 4-6.
F.   Present Project Status and Implementation
4.11      Project implementation is already under way. Because of their
existing relationship with SEKA on other projects and their good perform-
ance, Sandwell were engaged as consulting engineers in April 1975, with
the prior approval of the Bank of the terms and conditions. The responsibility
for overall project execution lies with SEKA, who will turn over operating
responsibility to the Balikesir Establishment after plant start-up. Sandwell
is responsible for the design of the entire plant other than the civil and
structural engineering, which SEKA has contracted locally. Sandwell also
is required to perform most of the procurement work, to expedite the delivery
of foreign equipment, and to provide engineering supervision of construction
through a staff of resident engineers. SEKA has excluded all non-process
parts of the project (housing, offices, worker facilities) from Sandwell's
contract. The Sandwell contract also provides for training, operating
and management assistance (para. 4.12). In practice, SEKA leans very heavily
on Sandwell to carry the project forward in timely fashion, and cooperation
between SEKA and Sandwell is good. General design development is nearing
completion and detailed design has begun. Site grading, road construction,
and drainage work in preparation for construction of the main mill buildings
is under way. The construction of offices, worker facilities, a central
steam heating plant, social facilities and the housing colony is well advanced.
Start-up of the sawmill is scheduled for October 1978 and of the newsprint



- 16 -
mill in January 1979. This timetable is considered realistic. A project
progress schedule is shown in Annex 4-7. Assurances have been obtained
that SEKA will not cancel nor amend its contract with Sandwell and Co. without
the prior approval of the Bank.
G.   Training and Management Assistance
4.12      Expatriate assistance in training, operations and management will
be provided by Sandwell Management Consultants Ltd., an affiliate of the
consulting engineers. As described in more detail in Annex 4-8, a contract
has been signed for a satisfactory program which provides for the support of
senior head office executives and a field staff of 12 experienced operating
personnel, to each of whom would be assigned a Turkish counterpart for train-
ing. Training would begin prior to start-up by a staff of six expatriate
resident engineers, who will help the Turkish operating staff to become
familiar with the new equipment. The Turkish staff is being selected from
those at SEKA's existing newsprint plant at Aksu. The contract contemplates
that the expatriates will remain on duty for periods ranging from 8 to 18
months after start-up. This is considered satisfactory as an initial arrange-
ment but the length of duty for the expatriates may have to be extended
depending on the success of the program. Assurances have been obtained from
SEKA that the training and management assistance program will be implemented
in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, and that by July 1, 1979 SEKA will
consult with the Bank on the need for an extension of the program.
H. The Balikesir Establishment
4.13      The Balikesir Establishment has already been legally established
as a subsidiary of SEKA, with an initial share capital of TL 100 million.
A number of staff have been appointed. Mr. Ferhat Kandemir, the Manager of
the Balikesir Establishment, has been working with SEKA for about 20 years
in several positions. The Establishment will be responsible for project
operation after its completion. The organization chart of the Balikesir
Establishment is shown in Annex 4-9.

V. CAPITAL COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN
A. Capital Cost Estimate
1. Basic Cost Estimate
5.01      The total financing required for the project is estimated at US$200.0
million, including US$81.7 million in foreign exchange as shown below.
More details are provided in Annex 5-1. Detailed cost estimates for civil
works and machinery and equipment by main departments are given in Annex 5-2,
and detailed working capital requirements are shown in Annex 5-3.

5.02      The Basic Cost Estimate was prepared by the consultants in February
1976. At that time, bids had been opened for the paper machine and the thermo-
mechanical pulp making equipment accounting for about one third of the estima-
ted cost of machinery and equipment of US$61 million. A physical contingency
of 8% has been added to provide for items that have been overlooked in preli-
minary design. Estimates for civil works were derived from preliminary
designs, and unit-cost information was obtained from the tendering results of
the Akdeniz project for which the main civil works contract was let in November
1975. Civil works include site preparation and development, construction of
all process and non-process buildings, plus provisions for overhead and profit
of the construction contractor. Construction overhead includes such items as
construction engineering and surveying, temporary structures and rental of
construction equipment for work execution. Based on the contract signed
between SEKA and Sandwell & Co., Sandwell will provide about 1,600 man-months
of engineering services and about 200 man-months of training and management
and operating assistance. Average man-month rates are US$3,100 for engineer-
ing and US$5,000 for training, management and operating assistance, both based
on March 1975 rates, with provision for total escalation of not more than 15%.
The scope of the engineering work was described in para. 4.11 and of the
training and management assistance program in para. 4.12.
2. Capital Cost Escalation
5.03      The total provision for price escalation, which has been assumed to
start from the date of the estimate, i.e. February 1976, amounts to US$39.3
million, including US$7.8 million for escalation of foreign exchange costs.
Price escalation represents 43% of the basic estimate for local costs, and
12.6% of the basic estimate for foreign costs, or 29% of total costs. The
assumptions used for and the detailed amounts of escalation are shown in Annex
5-4.
B. Financing Plan
5.04      The proposed financing plan for the project is as follows:
Financing Plan
TL Million     US$ Million       %
Equity
-SEKA/Government           1,280.0         80.0          40
Long-term Debt
-IBRD                       1,120.0        70.0          35
-DYB                         800.0         50.6          25
Sub-total             1,920.0        120.0          60

- 19 -
5.05      The Balikesir Establishment will increase its authorized share
capital from TL 100.0 million at present to the TL 1,280 million required
under the financing plan as a condition of effectiveness for the Bank Loan.
Since SEKA, because of its large expansion program currently underway (para.
2.04) is unlikely to have any internally generated funds available for this
project, assurances have been obtained that the Government will provide SEKA
for transfer to the Establishment with the equity as required from time to
time so that the Establishment up to the time of project completion maintains
a debt/equity ratio of no more than 60/40.
5.06      The proposed Bank Loan of US$70.0 million will be made directly
and jointly to SEKA and the Balikesir Establishment. Lending jointly to
SEKA and the Establishment is necessary since SEKA's subsidiaries (Establish-
ments) have only limited autonomy, especially in financial matters (para.
2.06). The Loan will be for 15 years, including 4 years of grace at an
interest rate of 8.5% p.a., to which a fee of one and one half percentage
points will be added, to be paid to the Government. SEKA and the Balikesir
Establishment will carry the foreign exchange risk on the Bank Loan. The
repayment schedule of and interest charges on the Bank Loan are shown in
Annex 5-5.
5.07      The DYB loan, which has already been approved by DYB's Board of
Directors, is to SEKA. Effectiveness of the DYB loan will be a condition of
effectiveness for the Bank Loan. It will be for a term of 17 years, including
5 1/2 years of grace, at 11.5% p.a. interest. The repayment schedule of and
interest charges on the DYB loan are shown in Annex 5-6.
5.08      It is judged that the capital cost estimate for the project is
sound and the provisions for escalation are satifactory in the light of
current expectations. However, past experience tells that inflation rates are
difficult to predict. Therefore, the usual assurances have been obtained
that the Government will provide or cause to be provided any additional
financing required to promptly complete the project in accordance with the
implementation schedule, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
These conditions include that a minimum of 40% of any such cost overrun
will be provided in the form of equity. The project will be considered as
completed when the manufacturing facilities have, during a period of 90
consecutive days, achieved a total production equivalent to 90% of the design
capacity of the facilities. SEKA's consulting engineers will certify to the
Bank when completion as defined above has been achieved.
C.   Procurement
5.09      Procurement procedures have already begun, and advertisements and
notifications have been made in compliance with Bank Guidelines, except for
five items of wood processing equipment with a value of about US$750,000 for
which bidding had already been completed before the Bank had an opportunity to
comment on the bidding documents. These items will be excluded from Bank



- 20 -
financing. International Competitive Bidding will be followed for all machi-
nery and equipment financed by the Bank Loan except for items that are esti-
mated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent which may be procured on the
basis of SEKA's bidding procedures. The aggregate amount of items so procured
is limited to US$1 million. SEKA's consulting engineers are combining bid
packages to the maximum extent feasible in order to concentrate vendor respon-
sibility. It is expected that there will be about 80 bid packages suitable for
Bank financing.
5.10      There will be the customary provision for a margin of preference
of 15% or the applicable duty, whichever is lower, for local manufacturers
who participate in International Competitive Bidding. Contracts for items
normally produced in Turkey (estimated at US$20 million equivalent) and the
civil works contracts (US$47 million) will be awarded on the basis of local
competitive bidding and in accordance with local procedures and will be
financed from local funds. The contract for engineering services and training,
management and operating assistance was awarded to Sandwell and Co. (para.
4.11).
D. Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
5.11      The Bank Loan will cover 86% of the estimated foreign exchange
part of the total financing required for the project. Because of the advanced
stage of procurement, it is expected that some time critical equipment con-
tracts will be signed in April and early May 1976, so that an estimated US$2
million will have been spent on down-payments on these contracts by the time
the Bank Loan is presented to the Executive Directors and signed, and about
US$0.7 million for engineering services. It is proposed to finance retro-
actively expenditures made after March 1, 1976, estimated to total US$2.5
million. The Bank Loan will be disbursed against 100% of the foreign exchange
expenditures on imported machinery and equipment and foreign consultants
as well as 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment if
awarded after international competitive bidding, and 100% of the cost of local
consultants. The total value of locally manufactured equipment awarded
after international competitive bidding is expected to be about US$10 million
equivalent.

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Manufacturing Costs
6.01      Detailed calculations of manufacturing costs at full capacity
operation are shown in Annex 6-1. Manufacturing costs (including deprecia-
tion but excliding financial charges) for sawnwood are estimated to be TL 1,376
(US$86) per m and for newsprint TL 6,400 (US$400) per ton in prices of 1975.
This compares with the cost of TL 5,840 (US$365) per ton of newsprint in 1975
in SEKA's Aksu mill (built in 1971) and TL 5,990 (US$374) per ton in 1975 in
SEKA's Izmit mill.

6.02      The cost of wood, kraft pulp and purchased power amount to about
55% of manufacturing costs.  The price3of wood, delivered millsite, has been3
estimated to be TL 600 (US$37.5) per m of sawlog and TL 400 (US$25.0) per m
of pulplog (Annex 4-2). These are in line with prices paid by other major
manufacturers outside of Turkey. Semi-bleached kraft pulp will have to be
imported. The import price has been assumed to be TL 7,600 (US$475) per ton
(bone dry), delivered mill.
6.03      Since mechanical pulp manufacture is an energy-intensive process,
newsprint production consumes about 3,500 kWh per ton of paper. The project's
total annual power requirements are estimated to be 370,000 MWh, of which
about 11% will be generated on site, and the remainder purchased from TEK
(para. 4.08). The cost of purchased power has been assumed as TL 0.42 per kWh.
This is above the current rate of TL 0.37 per kWh, which is however, expec-
ted to be increased in early 1976.
B. Sales Volume and Revenues
1. Sales Volume
6.04      The sawmill is expected to start production in October 1978, and
the pulp and papermill in January 1979. The project is expected to reach
full capacity utilization in 1982, as shown below. In view of the program
for training, management and operating assistance included in the project,
the assumed production buildup, still rather slow by standards of industrial-
ized countries, is considered realistic.

2. Revenues
6.05      The domestic price of newsprint is currently set by the Government
at TL 4,500 per ton which compares with production costs, excluding financial
charges, of the Aksu plant of TL 5,840 in 1975, and with estimated production
costs for the project in 1975 prices of TL 6,400 (para. 6.01). The Government
compensates SEKA for its losses in newsprint production through inclusion in
the budget of the next fiscal year of an amount equivalent to the actual loss,
including financial charges, incurred in the preceding year. The loss of the
Aksu mill in 1975 was TL 230 million (US$14.4 million). This system provides
no incentive to SEKA to be efficient in its newsprint production since losses
will be covered by the Government. The system also has the disadvantage that
it disguises the degree of subsidy to the newspapers since the subsidy is tied
to the actual operating loss of SEKA in newsprint production.
6.06      In order to permit the Balikesir Establishment to operate on a sound
commercial basis, and in order to make explicit to the greatest degree possible
the element of subsidy that exists in newsprint pricing to the consumer, a new
system will be introduced which, it is hoped, will not have the deficiencies
of the present system but does still allow the Government to support the
newspapers. To this end, assurances have been obtained that by the time the
Balikesir project starts production, SEKA will set the ex-factory newsprint
price at a level sufficient to enable the Balikesir Establishment to earn
each year a reasonable annual return under conditions of efficient operation
at 100% of design capacity. 1/ A reasonable annual return is understood to
1/   Design capacity ratings in the pulp and paper industry are normally quite
conservative, and it is common in industrialized countries to reach
110% of design capacity a few years after start-up.



- 24 -
be sufficient to provide for interest and other financial charges and a rea-
sonable profit, assuming efficient operations, after covering full operating,
administrative, general and sales expenses, including adequate provisions for
maintenance, straightline depreciation, taxes, surcharges and other levies.
Investment will be defined as total assets less current liabilities and less
any accummulated excess funds held for future use.
6.07      Applying the above formula, SEKA and the Balikesir Establishment
would be expected to establish an ex-factory newsprint price (in 1975 Dollars)
of about TL 8,200 (US$512.50) per ton, which compares with the current subsidi-
zed price of TL 4,500 (US$281.25) per ton.    Should the Government wish to
continue to subsidize publishers, it could do so by a variety of means not
affecting the ex-factory price received by the Balikesir Establishment. One
such way would be to have SEKA buy the newsprint from the Balikesir Establish-
ment at the required ex-factory price. SEKA could then sell the newsprint to
the consumers at whatever price the Government determines, and the Govermment
could compensate SEKA for the difference between the ex-factory price and the
price to the consumers in such a timely way as not to put a financial burden
on SEKA. As compared with the present system of subsidizing actual production
losses, this system would clearly identify the extent of the newsprint subsidy
and the efficiency of the operation of the Establishment. The Government is
expected to propose an appropriate arrangement by January 1, 1978 or about one
year prior to the anticipated date when Balikesir will begin production.
6.08      The difference between the price of US$512.5 as estimated for the
Balikesir Establishment and the comparable import price of US$430 (para. 3.08)
is explained mainly by the following factors. Efficiency of equipment utiliza-
tion has been assumed to be about 12% lower in Turkey than in the highly
industrialized newsprint exporting countries, where the same production
facilities would be expected to produce about 112,000 tpy of newsprint. The
price of electric power in Turkey (TL 0.42 per KWh or 26 mills) is at least
two to three times higher than the price paid by Scandinavian and North
American newsprint exporters. Direct and indirect taxes on inputs and output
are also comparatively high in Turkey. Newsprint is charged a sales tax
equivalent to about TL 465 (US$29) per ton. The price for fuel oil of US$97
per ton contains about 40% indirect taxes and compares to US$65 per ton paid
by manufacturers in exporting countries. Together, these cost differences add
up as shown below. Economies of scale are achieved in newsprint exporting
countries through the operation of multiple paper machines in one plant and/or
(more recently) through the installation of larger capacity machines, capable
of producing 200,000 tpy and more. It is difficult to quantity these economies
of scale. Because of the limitation of the local market, but also because of
the very experienced operating staff required to achieve the inherent economies
of these very large machines, a paper machine of 100,000 tpy capacity was
considered appropriate for the Balikesir project, which is still a fairly
large machine by international standards. In any case, there remain important
economies of scale to be achieved through installation of a second paper
machine. This possibility exists for the Balikesir newsprint mill.

C. Financial Projections
6.09      Financial projections have been prepared in current prices through
1979 and in constant prices thereafter. Prices of 1975 have been escalated
at 14% for 1976 and at 12% p.a. for 1977 through 1979, except the cost of
labor which has been assumed to increase annually at a rate three percentage
points above the rates given above. The domestic price of newsprint calcu-
lated on the basis of the new formula would have to be TL 13,200 per ton in
1979, reflecting the effect of domestic inflation between 1975 and 1979.
6.10      The main features of the projected financial statements for the
Balikesir Establishment are presented below.  The detailed projected income
statement for 12 years is shown in Annex 6-2, the projected cash flow statement
in Annex 6-3, and the projected balance sheets in Annex 6-4. Assumptions used
in the projected financial statements beyond those already discused are pre-
sented in Annex 6-5, and calculation of allowances for depreciation of fixed
assets and for amortization of capitalized expenses is shown in Annex 6-6.

- 26 -
6.11      The financing plan for the project provides that 40% of the financing
required will be provided in the form of equity (para. 5.04). Immediately
after start-up, the debt/equity ratio is expected to surpass 60/40 and reach
its highest point of 65/35 in 1980 because of the project's start-up losses.
However, by 1982 it is expected that the debt/equity ratio will return to a
level below 60/40. The project is expected to maintain a satisfactory current
ratio, but in order to insure good liquidity at start-up, assurances have been
obtained that the Government will provide, through SEKA, to the Establishment
any funds needed so as to give the Establishment at project completion current
assets at least 1.5 times its current liabilities. If after project completion
the Establishment's current ratio falls below 1.1, the Government will make
available to SEKA for transfer to the Establishment any funds needed so that
the Establishment can maintain a current ratio of at least 1.1.
6.12      The financial projections indicate that the project will have
a low debt service coverage in 1979 and 1980. This is acceptable in this case
since the project is expected to have accumulated cash of about TL 109 million
in excess of its operational requirements of TL 56 million, and the debt
service coverage is forecast to increase to 1.4 in the following year (1981)
and to 1.5 in 1982. However, in order to safeguard against any additional
borrowing by the Establishment, be it to complete the project or to finance
future expansions, assurances have been obtained that the Establishment will
not, and SEKA will not permit the Establishment to, incur any debt without the
approval of the Bank if after the incurring of such debt the internal cash
generation of the Establishment for the twelve-month period preceding the
incurrence of this debt would be less than 1.5 times the estimated maximum
debt service requirement for any succeeding fiscal year, including the debt
proposed to be incurred.
6.13      Starting with 1979, the Balikesir Establishment is expected to
accumulate cash in excess of its operating requirements, which could be
transferred to SEKA and/or the Government. However, in order to ensure that
the Establishment will maintain a strong liquidity position, assurances have
been obtained that the Establishment will not, without the prior approval of
the Bank, transfer profits to SEKA unless after such transfer the Establish-
ment maintains a current ratio of not less than 1.3. The Establishment will
have its accounts and financial statements audited for each fiscal year by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
6.14      As a capital intensive project, the Balikesir project requires
a high rate of capacity utilization before it reaches the profit break-even
point. A break-even chart is shown in Annex 6-7.  In prices of 1979, the
project would break even at a capacity utilization of about 81%. This capa-
city utilization, under the current production schedule, would be achieved in
1981, the third full year of operations.
D. Financial Rate of Return
6.15      The project's financial rate of return in 1975 Dollars is 11.8%
before sales tax and corporate income tax, 9.7% after sales tax but before
corporate income tax, and 7.7% after sales tax and corporate income tax
(Annex 6-8). This result reflects the proposed new system for determining



- 27 -
the ex-factory newsprint price for the Balikesir Establishment, which stipu-
lates that such price should be set at a level so as to enable the project to
earn a reasonable annual return after tax on its investment under assumption
of full capacity utilization. A return of 8% on investment was used for these
financial projections, which is considered a satisfactory return that would
enable the project to make a reasonable contribution to future expansions in
the sector.
6.16      In the event of a capital cost overrun incurred by the project,
or in the event that manufacturing costs in spite of efficient operations
exceed currently projected levels, application of the new system would lead to
a higher ex-factory newsprint price. The project's financial rate of return
is, therefore, protected against such cost increases. The sensitivity analysis
shows how the project's financial rate of return would be increased if the
domestic market were to grow at 10% p.a. (rather than the 8% p.a. used) or if
SEKA was correct in assuming that there was an unfulfilled demand of 10,000
tons of newsprint in Turkey in 1974 (para. 3.03). In either case, the entire
project output could be sold in the domestic market and no exports would be
necessary. However, a domestic market growth of 6% p.a. would require exports
beyond 1982 and would reduce the project's financial rate of return. The
reduction in financial rate of return caused by a 6-month delay in project
start-up or by a one-year delay in achievement of full capacity utilization
respectively, though still important, is moderated by the fact that this would
lead to a reduction or elimination of exports which are assumed to be made at
less than full costs.
Sensitivity Analysis of Financial Return
(after tax)
1.  Base Case                                           7.7%
2.  Market Growth at 10% p.a.                           8.2%
3.  Market Growth at 6% p.a.                           6.7%
4.  Delay of 6 Months in Project Completion            7.3%
5.  Delay of 1 Year in Achieving Full Capacity          7.2%
E. Risks
6.17      It has already been explained that an overrun in project cost and
an increase in manufacturing costs would be offset through an increase in the
ex-factory newsprint price as determined under the new system, but in any
case, it is judged that the manufacturing costs, including the cost of wood
to the project, have been conservatively estimated. As for the project cost
estimate, the provisions for cost escalation are reasonable in light of current
expectations. Close cost control will be exercised during project implementa-
tion in order to ensure that any adverse developments can be recognized as
early as possible. This leaves the risk of a delay in project completion and
a delay in the achievement of full capacity utilization as the project's two
major risks. The time-table for project completion is realistic in view of
the advanced stage of design development and equipment procurement. With
-i



- 28 -
regards to attaining full capacity as currently planned it is judged that this
can be achieved in light of the program for expatriate assistance.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Adjusted Capital and Manufacturing Costs
7.01      Detailed adjustments to the financial capital costs and manufactur-
ing costs of the project to convert them into their economic values are shown
in Annex 7-1. For imported goods, the c.i.f. border price, expressed in local
currency at the official exchange rate, has been used, for exported goods
the f.o.b. price. The financial cost of non-traded goods has been converted
into its border price equivalent through the application of conversion factors
that have been estimated for Turkey. Where no specific conversion factor
was available, the Standard Conversion Factor 1/ has been used. Unskilled
labor has been valued at a shadow wage rate, but the cost of this labor is
only a small fraction of total cost.
B. Economic Rate of Return
7.02      The international price for newsprint landed Turkey, has been estab-
lished at US$430 per ton (US$360 f.o.b.) in 1975 Sollars (para. 3.08), and
that for sawnwood, c.i.f. Turkey, at US$135 per m , also in 1975 Dollars.
Using these international prices and the adjusted costs as discussed above,
the economic rate of return of the project is 16.1% (Annex 7-2). The sen-
sitivity analysis of the economic rate of return is shown below. SEKA's
consultants maintain that the appropriate newsprint import price for Turkey
should be US$490 per ton instead of US$430 used in this report since
Turkey is buying in the spot market where prices in recent years have been
above contract price levels (para. 3.07). If this price had been used, the
project's economic rate of return would be 19.8%. If SEKA were correct that
the demand projection presented in this report underestimates actual demand by
about 10,000 tons (para. 3.03), or if demand were to grow at 10% p.a. rather
than the 8% p.a. projected, the project's economic return would be 16.3%.
The project's social rate of return will approximately equal the economic
return as the profits accrue to the Government and no input or output price
changes are anticipated because of the project.
1/   The Standard Conversion Factor represents the weighted average of the
ratios of the international prices, expressed in local currency at
the official exchange rate, to the domestic prices, for a wide range of
goods.

Sensitivity Analysis of Economic Rate of Return
Base Case                                               16.1%
Newsprint Price (landed Turkey) of US$490/ton           19.8%
Market Growth at 10% p.a.                               16.3%
Market Growth at 6% p.a.                                15.5%
Capital Cost Increase by 10%                           14.4%
Manufacturing Cost Increase by 10%                      14.1%
C.   Net Foreign Exchange Savings
7.03      Through domestic production of newsprint, the project will generate
net foreign exchange savings of about US$34 million per year which will pay
back the foreign exchange cost of the project in less than two and one-half
years.
D. Employment Effect
7.04      The direct employment effect of the project will be small in rela-
tion to the total investment. At full capacity operation there will be 725
hourly paid workers and 125 salaried employees. However, the project will
create significant indirect employment through the expansion of forestry
operations. As part of the expansion of forestry operations, total additional
employment in forestry operations would be created for 50,000 people if
forestry operations would continue with their present labor intensive methods,
which may not prove possible because shortages for this kind of labor may
develop. About 5%, or 2,500 people, of this can be attributed to the project
which will utilize about 5% of the wood produced in the area.
VIII. AGREEMENTS
8.01      Agreement has been reached as follows:
1.   The Government will:
(a) provide GDF with all funds and take all actions
necessary to assure the wood supply to the project,
including introduction of more modern forest manage-
ment techniques (para. 4.05);
(b) take all action and provide all funds necessary to
enable TEK to build and complete by no later than
July 1, 1978 the power transmission line to the pro-
ject site in accordance with a construction schedule
agreed with the Bank (para. 4.08);
(c)  provide SEKA for transfer to the Balikesir Establish-
ment with equity funds as required from time to time
so that the Establishment during project implementation
and at the time of project completion maintains a debt/
equity ratio of 60/40 (para. 5.05);



- 30 -
(d) provide or cause to be provided, on conditions satis-
factory to the Bank, any additional financing required
to complete the project (para. 5.08); and
(e) provide SEKA for transfer to the Balikesir Establish-
ment with any funds needed so as to give the Establish-
ment at project completion a current ratio of at least
1.5 and at all times thereafter a current ratio of at
least 1.1 (para. 6.11).
2.   SEKA will:
(a) review with the Bank the results of the study currently under-
taken by consultants as they relate to newsprint production
in Turkey (para. 3.05);
(b) introduce by December 1, 1978 a sawnwood selling and
distribution system substantially as recommended by its
consulting engineers in their related study of May 1975

EXISTING PRODUCTION FACILITIES AND
FUTURE EXPANSION PLANS
1.        A synopsis of SEKA's existing plants and projects under implementa-
tion, including their design capacity, main raw materials and employment, is
shown below (Table 1).
2.        The Izmit plant produces about 120,000 tpy of various paper grades
from wood and straw pulp. The plant, having originally started production
in 1936, has some technically obsolete installations, primarily the pulp
making equipment which also produces harmful liquid and gaseous effluents.
The paper making equipment is partly quite old but generally in good mech-
anical and operating condition. The plant is currently undergoing a major
modernization program which aims at the reduction of labor requirements,
reduction of other production costs, improvement in product quality and an
increase in paper-making capacity to 140,000 tons. This program is expected
to be completed by the end of 1976. In the long run, SEKA's management plans
to eliminate the production of chemical pulp from the Izmit plant because
of the pollution problems, and convert the Izmit plant into a non-integrated
papermill. The bleached straw pulp mill of the Izmit plant will be shut
down when the new reed and straw pulp mill at Afyon starts production, now
expected for 1977. The sulphite chemical pulp mill at Izmit would be closed
down when the new bleached kraft mill comes into operation for which SEKA has
just commissioned a study (see para. 7 below).
3.        The Caycuma plant, a modern mill commissioned in 1970, produces
sackkraft (45,000 tpy) and fluting (15,000 tpy). Both grades are produced
on one machine which is actually a linerboard machine but which is now being
modified for the production of sackkraft which will also increase the
machine's capacity from 60,000 tpy to 75,000 tpy. Future expansion plans
for Caycuma provide for the addition of more NSSC pulp making equipment and
a separate paper machine for fluting.
4.        The Aksu plant, a modern mill for newsprint based on stone ground-
wood, was commissioned in 1971. Its design capacity is 82,500 tpy of news-
print but the plant has been facing considerable start-up problems and has
so far reached production of only 71,150 tons in 1975 (see Annex 2-2). Capa-
city ratings in the pulp and paper industry are normally quite conservative,
and it is common in the industrialized countries to reach 110% of "capacity"
a few years after start-up. There are several reasons for the less than



ANNEX 2-1
Page 2
satisfactory performance of the Aksu plant, some of which are beyond SEKA's
control such as delivery of overmature wood and power outages. But perhaps
the main reason has been the inexperience of staff. SEKA is working to gra-
dually overcome the problems of the Aksu mill, but this will require some
time, and SEKA's management expects that full capacity will be reached by
1978. The staff of the mill will gradually gain more experience. The General
Directorate of Forestry is trying to deliver wood from younger trees which
give a higher fiber yield, but this problem too can be solved only gradually
as the forests are cleared of overmature trees and stocked with younger age
classes. In order to prevent drying of the wood after cutting, which again
reduces yield, SEKA and the GDF are jointly taking measures to better schedule
wood haulage from forest roadsides to the mill. As for power outages, there
is little that SEKA can do, but the performance of the Turkish Electricity
Authority (TEK) is generally expected to improve with the expansion of its
generating capacity and its interconnected transmission system, and other
measures undertaken by TEK. The possibility of expanding the capacity of the
Aksu mill exists and will be considered as part of the study of future pro-
jects currently being undertaken (para. 7 below). However, expansion of
the Aksu mill is less likely than of the Balikesir mill because of uncertainty
as to the adequacy of the wood supply for the Aksu mill and also because
the remote location results in high freight costs and makes it difficult to
keep competent staff.
5.        The Dalaman plant, SEKA's newest mill, was commissioned in 1972.
Its design capacity is 35,000 tpy of writing and printing paper and 40,000
tpy of boards. In 1975, in spite of reaching 85% capacity utilization, the
Dalaman plant was still running at a loss because the price of its main
product, an offset paper, was initially set by SEKA at below production costs
to introduce the product of this new mill. Now the paper from Dalaman is
well accepted in the Turkish market, and SEKA has approached the Government
for a price increase but this increase has not yet been implemented. Future
plans for the Dalaman plant provide for a significant expansion of its
bleached kraft pulp capacity and for integration with a sawmill, since the
plant is located in a major forested area. It also has access to the Antalya
region, from which the Akdeniz project, because of the change in its location,
is likely to draw less wood than previously planned. Water availability
is currently a problem for the Dalaman plant, but this is expected to be
solved through the construction of dams along the Dalaman river. The plant
at present has no waste water treatment plant, but preparatory work for such
facilities has been completed, and construction is planned to begin some-
time in 1976.
6.        The Afyon plant, for which commissioning is currently planned in
1977, will produce 50,000 tpy of bleached short fiber pulp from reed and
straw. Availability of short fiber pulp is limited in Turkey. No further
expansion plans for the Afyon mill exist.



ANNEX 2-1
Page 3
7.        The Akdeniz and Balikesir projects are expected to be completed
in late 1978 and early 1979. They are both integrated with sawmills and
will represent SEKA's most modern mills. For Akdeniz, which will be SEKA's
largest mill, no further expansion plans exist. Expansion of the Balikesir
newsprint mill will be considered in the future.
8.        A study for future projects has been commissioned.  A detailed
forest survey, financed by the UNDP and the Government, that covers all
Northern Turkey, is now nearing completion. Preliminary results of that
survey show that sufficient potential exists in the areas to supply wood for
largely expanded forest industries. The Government of Turkey, using SEKA and
GDF as its cooperating agencies, has, therefore, commissioned a study of a
forest industries development program to be based upon the North Turkey forest
resources. This study is financed by UNDP and the Government and carried out
by Sandwell, SEKA's consultants. It will be completed in mid-1977. It will
cover the manufacture of pulp, paper, paperboard and mechanical wood products
on an integrated basis and also consider possible expansion plans for SEKA's
existing mills. A feasibility study of the most viable project will be
included. A bleached kraft pulp mill is likely to be one of the more urgent
investments to come out of this study. Turkey is now short of bleached kraft
pulp. In addition, SEKA would like to close down its existing sulphite pulp
mill at Izmit because of the pollution caused by that mill.

SEKA
FINANCIAL POSITION
1.        SEKA's consolidated income statement for 1970 through 1975, and
projected for 1976 through 1980 is shown in Table 1. The poor results of
the years 1970 through 1973 reflect the start-up losses of the Caycuma,
Aksu and Dalaman plants. SEKA cannot consolidate the results of its subsi-
diaries for corporate income tax purposes. The corporate tax shown for the
years 1970 through 1973 is, therefore, the tax on the profits of the Izmit
plant. By 1974, the Caycuma plant was also earning a good profit, and the
Aksu plant, under its special arrangements discussed below (see para. 3),
was breaking even. Only the Dalaman plant was still showing a loss in 1974,
but overall for SEKA, 1974 can be considered as a satisfactory year.
2.        The year 1975 was expected to show equally good results as 1974.
However, during 1975, SEKA had some significant cost increases as a result of
the high rate of inflation in Turkey. On July 1, 1975, as a result of an
agreement with the unions, new labor rates became effective representing an
increase of 108% in labor costs. The same new agreement, valid for two years,
provides for an additional increase of 50% on July 1, 1976. SEKA will need to
adjust the prices of its products to reflect these increases in labor costs
and other general increases in the cost level.
3.        According to the law pertaining to all State Economic Enterprises
(SEE) in Turkey, SEE's are free to determine the prices of their products,
except for those products which have been declared as "basic commodities" by
the Government. For these commodities the Government determines the price
level but at the same time becomes responsible for compensating the SEE
concerned for the consequent losses in the production of that commodity
through budgetary allocations. In the case of SEKA, only newsprint has been
declared such a basic commodity, and this is why the Aksu plant breaks even
since its losses are being covered by the Government. However, even with
regard to its other products, SEKA in reality is not completely free to set
the price level, since it has become established practice that SEKA has to
obtain the opinion of the Government prior to introducing price increases.
This subjects SEKA to Government interests other than those purely related
to SEKA, such as the Government's current policy to reduce Turkey's rate
of inflation. Because of this policy, the Government has not yet agreed to
an increase in SEKA's prices to the new cost level, and the result was a loss
for SEKA in 1975. This "unofficial" government control over SEKA's product
prices makes it difficult to project SEKA's cash generation and financial
position. The projections in Table 1 have, therefore, been prepared on the



ANNEX 2-4
Page 2
basis of the cost level and product prices prevailing in mid-1975, prior
to the coming into effect of the new labor rates.
4.        SEKA's projected consolidated cash flow statements for 1976
through 1980 are shown in Table 2. They reflect the significant investment
expenditures that SEKA will be making for its three new projects now under
implementation. Since SEKA is fully Government owned, any restriction
through price control on its potential for cash generation must be offset
by the Government through an even more increased infusion of capital in the
form of equity or loans over the amounts already required for SEKA's large
investment program.
5.        SEKA's consolidated balance sheets, actual for 1970 through 1975
and projected for 1976 through 1980 are shown in Table 3. By 1980, SEKA's
share capital is expected to reach TL 5.4 billion.

1/   Projections have been made in prices of mid-1975.
2/   Newsprint currently is sold at a price set by the Government below production costs.  The difference   is   covered by the Government through a budgetary allocation.
3/   New labor rates became effective on July 1, 1975 which represent an increase of 108% in labor costs.  On July 1, 1976 an additional increase of about 50% will become
effective. Since product prices have not yet been adjusted to reflect higher labor costs, projections have been made using the labor rates which were in effect
until June 30, 1975.

THE WORLD MARKET FOR NEWSPRINT
The Past
1.        World production of newsprint has grown on the average at a rate
of 4.1% annually in the last twenty years, reaching about 22 million tons in
1974. The pattern of consumption on a regional or country basis differs con-
siderably from that of production. and from this difference large trade
currents originate. The main exporters are Canada, the Scandinavian coun-
tries and the USSR. The largest importer by far is the U.S.A., which ac-
counts for more than one half of the world's total imports, followed by the
U.K., Germany, France, Australia, the Netherlands and Argentina (Table 1).
2.        Consumption in developing countries has generally grown faster than
in the developed countries, mainly because it started from a very low level,
but also because of faster population growth, campaigns to increase literacy,
and rapid urban growth. In spite of this rapid growth, however, per capita
consumption in the developing world still lags considerably behind the figures
reached by the developed world (See Annex 3-1).
The Outlook for Coming Years
3.        The most recent forecast: prepared by FAO indicates that newsprint
demand in the market economies is expected to grow from 20.4 million tons in
1973 to 27.3 million tons in 1979 or by about 5% p.a. 1/. In the developed
market economies it is expected to grow from 18.6 to 24.5 million tons (4.8%
p.a.) and in the developing market economies from 1.8 to 2.8 million tons
(7.5% p.a.).  Total production capacity in the market economies is expected
to be 25.2 million tons by 1979. Since the Centrally Planned Economies
among themselves are more or less self-sufficient, this would indicate a
supply deficit in 1979 and an upward pressure on prices. However, it must
be pointed out that gap figures, being differences of much larger quantities,
are extremely sensitive to relatively small variations in the demand and
production estimates. In its previous estimate of April 1974, FAO had set
the deficit for newsprint at only 0.6 million tons. More recently, it has
been mentioned that new (or expanded) capacity may have been underestimated
in the April 1975 estimate. Therefore, it is now generally felt in the
trade that no serious deficit in production will actually occur in the next
five years. On the other hand, no overproduction or serious capacity
underutilization is expected either.

World Newsprint Prices
4.        The international market for newsprint is in fact two distinct
markets. Most newsprint is sold in the contract market in which major pro-
ducers and major consumers enter into long-term contracts (usually 5 to 10
years, with provision for extension). Contracts are flexible, and both
quantities and prices may be modified through mutual agreement. In the spot
market, quantities of newsprint are bought and sold on a single transaction
basis. The price for any transaction is negotiated in light of the supply-
demand situation existing at that point in time. In times of short supply
(such as 1973 and 1974) spot prices exceed (sometimes double and more) those
applying in the contract market, while in periods of overcapacity suppliers
may be prepared to dump tonnage by accepting prices below going contract
prices.
5.        Published prices are contract prices while spot prices are diffi-
cult to obtain. Scandinavian contract prices are generally higher than
North American prices, currently by about 10% to 15%. The history of news-
print prices in the U.S.A. (delivered East Coast) is shown below.

1976 /1                 280                              308
/1   In January 1976, major US manufacturers announced an increase
from US$260 to US$280 per short ton.
6.        Scandinavian newsprint prices have been about US$300 per ton (f.o.b.)
in 1975.  The industry claims that at present price levels return on investment
is marginal for existing operations and completely inadequate for new plants.
An increase of about 20% in real terms is thought to be necessary in the course
of the next years to increase profits of existing newsprint plants and make
construction of substantial new capacity attractive. Therefore, a price of
US$360 per ton (f.o.b. Scandinavia) in 1975 Dollars is estimated to be a
good basis for calculation of return for plants going into full operation by

the end of the present decade. However, price increases - other than passing
on higher input costs - are expected to take place only gradually because the
immediate growth in demand will be met by the expansion and modernization of
existing plants. However, within five years, a price increase in the range
described above is expected to take place to make possible the construction of
new plants, which, by then, will have become needed to meet growing demand.

ANNEX 3-5
TURKEY
BALIKESIR NEWSPRINT PROJECT
SAWNWOOD MARKET IN TURKEY
1.        Export and import of sawnwood in Turkey is not very important and
consumption is practic lly identical to domestic production, which amounted
to about 2.7 million m  of sawnwood in 1974.  About 80% of all sawnwood is
used for building construction and the remainder for furniture, shipbuilding,
truck-bodies, and other miscellaneous uses.
2.        The marketing area for the Balikesir sawmill will be primarily the
cities of Istanbul, Izmir and, to a lesser extent, Ankara. About 20% of
Turkey's population lives in the area of these cities and about 45% of all
building permits (by square meter of floor area) are issued there so that
it constitutes ibout one-third of Turkey's sawnwood market or currently
about 900,000 m . About 80% of this market is for coniferous sawnwood and,
would, therefore, be available to the project which will process only coni-
ferous species.
3.        Average growth of sawnwood consumption has been 7.5% per year in
the past ten years. There is no reason why this growth rate should actually
decline, but as a measure of safety, an annual growth rate of 5% is being
used in this report to project future demand. This would mean an increase
in consumption between 1975 and 1982, the year when the Balikesir sawmiXl
is expected to reach full production, of about 40%3or about 1 million m
throughout Turkey, respectively of about 400,000 m of sawnwood in the area
to be served by this mill. The potential suppliers of this amount are the
existing sawmills, none of which have any known firm expansion plans end
SEKA's sawmills to be built as part of the Akdeniz project (170,000 m p.a.)
and the Balikesir project (105,000 m3 p.a.).
4.        Prices for sawnwood vary considerably according to species, grade
and length, and condition of sale, and little systematically recorded, author-
itative price information is available in Turkey. Some indicative price in-
formation is shown below. The trend has been a near doubling of prices over
the last five years. Although there are some indications of weakening of
prices in recent months, this is considered to be a temporary phenomenon,
and on a long-term basis prices are expected to continue to rise at least as
rapidly as the general price level. About 25% of the mill output is expected
to be sorted into joinery grade, the remainder into construction grade. About
80% will be normal length (3 to 4.5 m) and 20% will be short length which
brings a price about 10% to 15% below normal length. On this basis a weigh-
ted average mill net price for sawnwood of TL 1,390 (US$86.88) has been estab-
lished, based on mid-1975 prices.

5.        At present time, sawnwood imports into Turkey are not permitted,
but for purposes of the economic analysis, estimates of c.i.f. border prices
are required. Quotations obtained in June 1975 are shown below. They indi-
cate that import prices are about TL 600 per m3 higher than Turkish prices
for construction grades, and the only quotation obtained for a joinery grade
(Scandinavian joinery) was even more than TL 1,000 per m  higher than the
comparable Turkish price. Since the Scandinavian joinery grade is a better
quality than can be produced from Turkish species, a certain discount has
to be expected for Turkish joinery. In any case, since the mill output is
heavily weighted to construction lumber, the border price for joinery grade
is not very important. The 1975 weighted average price c.i.f. Turkish
border for sawnwood has, therefore, been set at US$135 (TL 2,160) per m3

BALIKESIR NEWSPRINT PROJECT
SAWNWOOD DISTRIBUTION AND SELLING METHODS
IN TURKEY
1.        In the private sector where most mills serve small markets, buyers
visit the mill site to conclude a sale by negotiating price and terms. Visit
to the mill site is important, since the smaller private mills do not follow
any established grading system, and the buyer has to inspect his merchandise.
Some of the larger private mills employ a price list with bargaining proce-
dure. Sales from the public sector mills, on the other hand, are made through
auctioning, normally at or near the mill site. This is a cumbersome system
for both buyer and seller. The buyer must travel to the auction which may
not even result in a satisfactory purchase for him. The buyer's option as
to grade and size specifications are restricted since the lots of sawn-
wood are already made up by the mill. For the seller, the auctioning system
requires holding of large in entories. In the case of the Balikesir mill
which will sell some 8,750 m of sawnwood each month, much more than any
quantities currently being auctioned by the public sector mills, this would
require numerous auctions lasting several days each in the presence of a large
group of buyers. Since the Balikesir Establishment would market its sawnwood
in accordance with the grading rules used by the public sector mills, there
would really be no need for buyers to visit the mill.
2.        In connestion with the Akdeniz project which also comprises a
sawmill (170,000 m p.a.) SEKA had, therefore, requested its consultants
to prepare a detailed study of the existing selling methods, including the
system of communication with buyers and of transportation of the sawnwood
to the point of delivery. This study was completed in May 1975 and pro-
posed the following. Sawnwood prices would be set by SEKA in a published
price list that would also offer a variety of credit terms. This list
would be amended by SEKA from time to time in accordance with changing
market conditions. Regional selling offices would be established by SEKA
in Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir and Adana or Mersin, and these offices would
solicit business and promote sale of sawnwood from SEKA's Balikesir and
Akdeniz sawmills. Buyers would be encouraged to permit SEKA to arrange
transportation in order to facilitate an orderly flow from the mill.

TURKEY
BALIKESIR NEWSPRINT PROJECT
PROJECT PRODUCTION CAPACITY
Newsprint Machine
1.        The principal purpose of the project is the production of news-
print, and therefore newsprint capacity must first be chosen. The con-
siderations in sizing the newsprint machine at 100,000 tpy were the available
market, economic size and speed of paper machine as demonstrated in recent
installations in the major newsprint exporting countries, and SEKA's capa-
bility to operate such a plant with provision of expatriate operating and
management assistance and training. Market forecasts indicate that 100,000 tpy
of additional newsprint capacity is likely to be fully absorbed by 1983, so
that from market consideration alone a larger machine capacity could have been
considered.
2.        The capacity of a paper machine is a function of both width and
speed, as well as the basis weight of the paper and the time that the
machine is actually producing saleable paper. Generally, it is more eco-
nomic to increase speed within the capability of the operators and the
machine than to increase width, because the latter involves increasingly
heavy machinery. However, there is also an economic limit to speed, because
at the upper speed limits of a given machine the production loss due to
paper web breaks and cost increases in higher chemical pulp requirements
to hold the wet web together outweigh the small gain in speed.
3.        Most of the recent newsprint machines in the newsprint exporting
countries produce a sheet of newsprint about 9 m wide at a speed on the
order of 1,000 m per minute, and produce over 200,000 tpy. Any new newsprint
machine in Turkey should have a newsprint web width in multiples of 85 cm,
since this is the most common newsprint roll width delivered to publishers,
with its double, 170 cm, being next most common. These two widths account for
over 80% of the tonnage in Turkey. The one existing newsprint machine in
Turkey, at SEKA's Aksu mill, trims 680 cm, or 8 x 85 cm. Its design speed is
up to 600 m per minute, but so far it has been operating at an average speed
of only 520 m per minute. To consider a wider machine for the Balikesir
project, one could only contemplate trim widths of 765 and 850 cm and remain
within the present practical width limitation of 9 m. However, such machines
would be among the largest newsprint machines in existence, and in light of
the operating experience at the Aksu mill it may not be desirable to install
such a sophisticated machine. Even a machine of 680 cm trim width is still
relatively large by overall North American and Scandinavian standards.
Sandwell, SEKA's consulting engineers, whose staff includes people with
extensive newsprint manufacturing experience, have studied this question in
considerable depth, and have concluded that there would be advantages in
having the Balikesir newsprint machine of the same width as the machine at



ANNEX 4-1
Page 2
the Aksu mill, but that, with the help of expatriate operating and management
assistance and training, the speed of the Balikesir machine could be brought
up to 680 m per minute. This would result in an annual capacity of the
Balikesir newsprint machine of 100,000 tons under the assumption of 350
operating days per year at 82% machine efficiency. The details of the train-
ing and assistance program are discussed in Annex 4-8.
Sawmill
4.        The capacity of the newsprint mill having been established, the
sawmill capacity was then estimated from the pulpwood requirements of the
newsprint mill and the expected ratio of sawlogs to pulplogs in the wood
supply to the project, utilizing estimated sawnwood and pulpable residue
recovery iactors for the sawmill. This Jed to a sawnwood capacity of
105,000 m per year, utilizing 221,000 m (ub) per year of sawlogs. It should
be noted that this determination of the sawmill capacity is not a precise
calculation, since log supplies are bound to vary and hence the probable
sawnwood recovery factor.

FOREST RESOURCES AND COST OF WOOD SUPPLY
Forest Resources Tributary to Balikesir
1.        The basic forest data for the five Forest Conservancies adjacent
to and including Balikesir, that will supply the project, were collected as
part of the North Turkey Forest Study. The annual allowable cut (AAC) 1/ was
calculated on the basis of forest inventory data and is shown by species and
by conservancy below.

Log Volumes
2.        To determine the log volumes which could be made available to the
proposed pulpmill/sawmill complex, the 1974 log sales volumes were considered
to be the present log demand. The AAC, distributed into the various cate-
gories of log products, was used as the possible total production from
the forests. The difference between the two for each conservancy was deemed
to be currently surplus and therefore available. By weighing the pressure
on timber supplies, due to nearness of population centers, an allocation of
wood supply by conservancy was made as shown below. As a result of the North
Turkey Forest Study, revisions will be possible as to the calculated AAC.
These revisions are likely to result in new surplus wood estimates and new
allocations by conservancy of wood supply to the Balikesir mill. Preliminary
results indicate that all pulplogs could possibly be supplied from the
Balikesir Conservancy only, and all sawlogs possibly from the three conser-
vancies Balikesir, Izmir and Bursa. To obtain the wood from these closer
sources would reduce the wood hauling costs to the mill.
1/   The theory of the AAC calculation is to balance annual cut with growth.

Log Prices and Delivery Costs
3.       Log prices for use in preparation of the wood cost to the project
have been estimated on the basis of the protocol signed between SEKA and
the General Directorate of Forestry (GDF) for the wood supply to the project,
which stipulates that prices of sawlogs will be based on average log sales
for the preceding six months while pulplog prices will be based on direct
production costs plus an allocated overhead cost and a fixed profit allow-
ance. The GDF will deliver the wood to the roadside and will notify SEKA.
SEKA will be responsible for hauling the wood from the roadside within
one month of being notified of its location. If delayed past one month,
the GDF will haul the logs to its sales depots and charge SEKA for the
extra cost. Transportation costs from roadside to the Balikesir mill
have been estimated on the basis of data developed in the North Turkey
Forest Study. Delivered wood costs are shown below.

(23.4 million ha) and Finland (21.7 million ha). However, management of
Turkey's forests is difficult due to the scattered nature of many small forest
areas, degraded forests, steep slopes, rocky soils, and the rights of forest
villagers to work in the forest and to be supplied with forest products. Much
of Turkey consists of the treeless Central Anatolyan Plateau which is ringed
by mountains that drop steeply into the sea.   The narrow belt on the seaward
side of the mountains with its higher rainfall and cooler marine climate,
supports most of Turkey's commercial forests. Some of the least accessible
forest areas have had little disturbance from their natural state, but most
forest areas have had the better trees continually cut from them, for many
centuries. This has left only the poorly formed, overmature trees to scatter
seed, and the resulting forest trees have developed poorer and poorer form.
It is impossible to know how much this negative selection has affected the
genetic form of the trees but it is obvious that the easily accessible red
pine (P. brutia) forests have much poorer form than the very inaccessible red
pine forest which have had little or no cutting in the past.
2.        The present growth rates of the forest stands have been measured to
provide a means of calculating the annual allowable cut. However, these growth
rates of the present stands and the annual allowable cuts calculated from these
measurements are low because the present forests are poorly stocked with an ex-
cess of slow-growing mature and overmature trees. Present measurements indi-
cate a Pinus brutia growth rate of 2.3 to 2.8 m3 overbark per hectare per
year. The prevailing growing conditions are capable of much better growth
rates if the forests are converted to a good distribution of younger age
classes with fully stocked stands.
Forest Management Organization
3.        The Ministry of Forestry (MOF) is charged with administering all
laws pertaining to forestry. It is divided into the following four adminis-
trative groups:
(i) General Directorate of Forests (GDF)
(ii) Directorate of Forest Products and Industries (ORUS)
(iii) Directorate of Erosion Control and Reforestation (GDA)
(iv) Directorate of Forest Villages



ANNEX 4-3
Page 2
4.        ORUS manages the larger size Government owned sawmills and particle-
board plants; the Directorate of Erosion Control and Reforestation is respons-
ible for erosion control and reforestation activities on larger blocks of
denuded forest lands; and the Directorate of Forest Villages is responsible
for villagers' rights with regard to the neighboring forest.
5.        The General Directorate of Forests (GDF) is the principal forest
management branch of the Ministry of Forestry. It has a complete network
of headquarters and large field staff covering all the forest areas of Turkey.
In addition to silvicultural forest management, its activities include pol-
icing the forest area to reduce encroachment; protecting the forest from
fire, disease, etc.; harvesting all forest products including logs, fuelwood,
pulpwood, resin, and other secondary forest products; building and maintaining
forest roads to make harvesting activities profitable; selling all forest
products; and collecting all stumpage charges and fees. GDF is the principal
income producing branch of the MOF.
Present Management System
6.        Technical management of the forests is based on a detailed management
plan and a silvicultural plan drawn up for each seri, a small management
block. Seris average only about 2,700 hectares of productive forest. Seri
boundaries are located mostly Qn geographical features, and the amount of
productive forest in any one seri can vary from none to possibly 10,000
hectares. The amount of timber to be harvested in each seri every year is
determined by an Annual Allowable Cut (AAC) calculation based on the amount of
annual growth measured in the forest inventory. The theory is to balance cut
with growth, but to achieve this when separate AAC's are calculated for areas
as small as seris it is necessary that each part of each seri must have forest
roads constructed to provide access for timber removal. Much road has still
to be constructed to make all parts accessible.
7.        Harvesting principles vary with the conditions existing in each
seri, but the general objectives are to periodically harvest the amount of
growth being achieved by the existing forest and to do this in a manner
that will insure adequate regeneration. There are usually four to five cuts
over a twenty-year period, with the last cut being of widely-spaced mature
trees and taking place after natural regeneration has become adequately es-
tablished. If natural regeneration does not occur or if it is inadequately
stocked, then the last cut is followed by artificial regeneration, either
by hand seeding or by planting nursery-raised seedlings.
8.        Afforestation of large denuded areas is very important for Turkey
not only for the production of wood, but also for prevention of soil erosion.
The GDA is responsible for afforestation of denuded areas. Four years after
a plantation has been established, the area is turned over to the GDF to
manage as a productive forest. Most of these denuded areas are former agricul-
tural lands abandoned due to loss of fertility from erosion of steep, shallow
soils. It is of utmost importance to Turkey's future wood needs to be able



ANNEX 4-3
Page 3
to convert as much as possible of these denuded areas into productive forests
without sacrificing the true needs of the people for grazing lands. Grazing
and human encroachment are serious damaging events which GDF is trying to
control by policing and public education, but they need substitute methods of
providing family subsistence before they can be completely controlled.
Proposed Changes in the Management System
9.        The North Turkey Forest Study covers 15 forest conservancies in the North
Aegean, Marmara and Black Sea Regions. Five of these conservancies (Canakkale,
Izmir, Bursa, Eskisehir, and Balikesir) form the region from which the proposed
Balikesir newsprint mill and sawmill complex will draw its wood supply. The
forest consultants conducting this study have recommended major changes in
forest management systems which have already been accepted in principle by the
GDF for other conservancies in Turkey. The Government of Turkey, through the
Director General of the GDF, has fully subscribed to these changes. It is ex-
pected that these recommendations when implemented in the study area will re-
sult in increased AAC's and wood extraction. The major changes are:
(i) to prepare new management plans using much larger areas than
the seri as basic management units which would provide greater
flexibility in selecting locations from which the AAC can be
extracted. The total MAC can be extracted from mature and
overmature stands that already have road access, while road
construction develops access into future logging areas;
(ii) recalculation of AAC's based on shorter rotation ages and
higher yields resulting from additional wood recovered through
thinnings and from restructuring slow-growing, poorly-stocked,
overmature stands into fully-stocked, fast-growing young
stands;
(iii) revised harvesting principles, particularly in Pinus brutia
stands. Mature and overmature Pinus brutia stands should
be clear-cut followed immediately by planting or artificial
seeding using seed from selected trees or from genetically
proven seed orchards. The only other cutting, except for
salvage of damaged or diseased trees, should be designed
to leave a fully-stocked stand of vigorous trees stimulated
to increased growth by the removal of excess trees which
would otherwise die and be lost from commercial use;
(iv) establishment of permanent sample plots designed to give
accurate growth and yield data for all species and all
growing conditions.



ANNEX 4-3
Page 4
10.       Over the next four years the GDF plans to invest nearly US$20 mil-
lion in the 15 northern conservancies in an effort to increase wood production
and reforestation capacity. A sizeable portion of this capital will be in-
vested in road construction and maintenance equipment, and it is expected that
with this increased road development the conservancies should be able to
achieve their AAC's. About one third of the planned investment will be made
in the five conservancies which will provide the wood for the Balikesir mill.
Only a portion of this investment will directly increase production for the
Balikesir mill, since much of the wood produced will be sold as fuelwood and
to other sawmills.
Forest Labor
11.       Felling and bucking (crosscutting) is mostly done by gasoline powered
chain saws. Extraction of wood products from stump to the roadside is entirely
by man or animal power. Contract prices paid by the GDF for debarked sawlogs
delivered to the roadside, including cost of felling, bucking and debarking,
presently vary from TL 56 to TL 86 per m3. Debarked short industrial wood aver-
ages TL 30 per stere stacked alongside the road. A shortage of forest labor is
already causing some problems in meeting planned wood production and afforesta-
tion targets. The wood production needed to supply this project will provide
jobs for an additional 1,700 people and the associated forestry activities will
require an additional 800 people. Production labor presently comes from two
sources. The most skilled and efficient are the professional logging families
who lead a nomadic life, living in tent camps near high elevation logging opera-
tions in the summer and low elevation operations in the winter. In this way
they make their entire livelihood from logging. They usually own their chain-
saws, mules or oxen, and other equipment necessary to contract all the work
from stump to roadside. Some have their own truck. Other seasonal and less
efficient labor comes from permanent villages where they make a portion of
their livelihood by farming. Logging operations dependent on this type of
seasonal labor require a larger number of laborers for an allowable annual
cut produced in a short period of time. Every effort should be made to
develop more skilled, full time forest workers.

TURKEY
BALIKESIR NEWSPRINT PROJECT
NEWSPRINT QUALITY AID PROCESS TECHNOLOGY
Newsprint Quality
1.        Standard newsprint is by far the most common type used in the
world. Special types of newsprint. are not used in Turkey. Standard news-
print is further subdivided into letterpress and offset types. The essential
difference between the two is that. the surface of the offset type should be as
free of "lint" as possible. "Lint" is caused by loosely bonded fibers on the
surface of the newsprint sheet. The more "lint", the more frequently must the
web offset presses be stopped to wash off the accumulation of "lint" on the
rubber blankets that interferes with good reproduction. Because a high and
growing percentage of newspapers in Turkey, in common with many other count-
ries, print by web offset, the rec[uction of lint is of major importance. All
web-printed newspapers, which include all but the small weeklies that use
sheet newsprint (about 10% of consumption in Turkey), require newsprint with
adequate printability, opacity and runnability without web breakage. They
also want as bright a sPeet as possible and a sheet not over the standard
basis weight of 52 gr/m because Pewsprint is sold by weight whereas news-
papers sell printed area to their advertisers. The principal complaint from
newspaper publishers concerning SEKA's newsprint is that it is usually 5% over
standard basis weight, although it: is also significantly darker than western
newsprint and has a rougher surface.
2.        There has been a trend in the industrialized  countries toward
lighter basis weight neysprint. In North America, the most common basis
weight is now 48.8 gr/m (30 lb/3000 sq.ft.), with no present trend dis-
cernible to lower weights. In Europe, where newsprint prices are higher
than in North America, basis weights are d2clining further, and it now
appears that they may stabilize at: 45 gr/m . An upcharge is made for lighter
basis weights, so that any saving to the publisher in printing area costs
through lighter basis weights is minimized, but it can reduce his mailing and
distribution costs. All newsprint produced by SEKA is programmed at the
standard basis weight of 52 gr/m . There is no present interest in Turkey in
lighter basis weights. Project capacities have, therefore, been calculated
assuming production of 52 gram paper, but the facilities could readily be used
to produce lighter paper.



ANNEX 4-4
Page 2
Process Technology
3.        The Balikesir project will utilize two recent technological develop-
ments: thermomechanical pulping for the production of pulp and twinwire sheet
forming on the paper machine. The remainder of the process technology is long
established.
4.        Virtually all newsprint in the world is produced, and has been
for the last century, from a mixture of mechanical and chemical woodpulps.
Little or no additives are used: sometimes red and blue dyestuffs for tinting
to hide a yellowish cast, alum to set the dyes and control pitch, and china
clay in the lighter-weight sheets to improve opacity. The mechanical pulp
component is the lowest in cost and provides desirable qualities in respect to
printability and opacity, characteristics of prime importance to newspaper
publishing. The chemical pulp component, generally made from long-fiber wood
species, provides qualities of strength so essential to successful running of
newsprint on the printing press and on the paper machine. Because of the
relatively high cost of chemical pulps, the newsprint industry continually
seeks to reduce the proportion of chemical pulp and therefore seeks ways and
means for improving the strength of the mechanical pulp component.
Mechanical Pulp
5.       Until recent years, mechanical pulp for newsprint was entirely
manufactured by the stone groundwood process, and the use of such groundwood
in newsprint manufacture demands a substantial chemical pulp component.
Stone groundwood is made by pressing roundwood against a rotating stone,
with copious addition of recirculated water for cooling and flushing away
the crude groundwood. Stone groundwood has the disadvantage of requiring the
use of more expensive roundwood. The stage was therefore set for the develop-
ment of methods that could produce mechanical pulp from wood residues.
6.        Although by far the greater part of the world's supply of mech-
anical pulp for newsprint is still produced as stone groundwood, most of
the new installations in recent years utilize the newly developed refiner
process. The first refiner process developed was the simple double-disk
refiner where wood chips are passed between two counterrotating grooved
steel disks. It was found that two and even three stages of refining produced
superior-strength pulps, but the process was very energy intensive, consuming
about 50% more energy than the stone groundwood process. Therefore, the use
of the refiner groundwood process has been limited to areas where wood residues
could be obtained at significantly lower cost than roundwood to compensate for
the higher energy requirements. The fact that a controlled proportion of
selected sawdust can be tolerated in the refiner groundwood, gave an added
advantage to that process.



ANNEX 4-4
Page  3
7.        The most recent development is a modification of refiner ground-
wood called thermomechanical pulp (TMP) which shows great potential and
already dominates new mechanical pulp installations in the last two years.
The TMP modification of refiner groundwood consists of first passing the chips
through a presteaming chamber where the chips are steamed under pressure for a
short period (longer steaming darkens the pulp) followed by pressurized
double-disk refining as a first stage. Presteaming plasticizes the wood so
that fiber separation is made easier. The refining energy expended produces
nearly all the steam needed in the process. This is normally followed by a
second but atmospheric stage of refining to produce superior strength ground-
wood at a total energy consumption well below that of refiner groundwood, but
still above that of stone groundwood. The pulping yield is the same for all
three processes: about 95%. The higher energy consumption (about 20%) of TMP
compared to stone groundwood is more than justified by the reduction in
chemical pulp required as a result of the superior strength characteristics of
TMP. Another advantage of TMP over the other two types of mechanical pulp is
that it greatly reduces the aforementioned "lint" problem. Reductions in the
source of "lint" have been reported from 50 to 90%.
8.        Pine has been utilized in newsprint manufacture for some 40 years,
following the discovery that alum would stabilize the pitch in pine so that
it would not interfere with paper manufacture. However, nearly all pine
groundwood has been stone. On the other hand, the first manufacturer to
produce pine newsprint has ordered TMP equipment to be the sole source of
groundwood ior his next newsprint expansion, and several other major producers
of pine newsprint have made commitments to TMP. The particular pine species
to be utilized in the Balikesir project have not been used in newsprint
manufacture. Laboratory and pilot plant tests which were carried out in
December 1975, indicate that the Turkish pines are as suitable for newsprint
manufacture as any of the resinous pines presently used. It is therefore
judged that the use of pine TMP in newsprint is sufficiently well established
to be appropriate for use in this project.
Chemical Pulp
9.        No chemical pulp will be produced in this project for environmental
reasons, and will have to be imported because there is no surplus chemical
pulp available in Turkey. The preferred chemical pulp for use in newsprint
manufacture is long-fiber semi-bleached sulphate pulp because of its high
strength characteristics. Experience in existing newsprint mills operating
at speeds similar to this project and using stone groundwood shows that
between 20 and 25% semi-bleached sulphate pulp is required. There is in-
sufficient experience with pine TMP in newsprint at the proposed speed,
which is slower than machines presently utilizing TMP. One older mill in
Eastern Canada, operating at speeds below that proposed in this project,



ANNEX 4-4
Page 4
has made saleable newsprint for years using only multistage refiner ground-
wood. The consulting engineers have selected 15% of semi-bleached sulphate
pulp for forecasting purposes. It is judged that this is a conservative
estimate.
Twin-wire Forming of Newsprint Sheet
10.       For the past 175 years, most paper has been formed as a continuous
wet web on a device called a fourdrinier after its developer. This device
consists of a headbox to spread the dilute suspension of fiber in water
evenly over a traveling woven screen, through which water is removed first
by gravity and then by vacuum devices. Improvements have been made over the
years, but the principle has not been changed so that the fourdrinier is
still the dominant method of sheet forming. In the past decade, however, a
major improvement to the fourdrinier has been developed: the twin-wire
former, with various configurations by different machine manufacturers. In
a twin-wire former, the web is formed between two endless traveling wire
screens by draining water in both directions. The twin-wire former offered an
end to two-sidedness of paper, which is inevitable on a single-wire former
where water is drained only through the underside of the web, leaving fine
fibers on the top side and the underside devoid of fines. Printers in
particular fought the printing variations caused by the surface characteristics
being different between the two sides of a sheet of paper. Initially, twin-
wire formers had some technical problems, but through further development work,
the present generation of twin-wire formers is well accepted. For new in-
stallations of printing paper machines (including newsprint), virtually all
are twin-wire, and many existing printing paper machines are being converted
to twin-wire. In addition to eliminating two-sidedness, it has been found
that twin-wire formers greatly reduce the linting problem, so that web-offset
newspaper publishers have reported as high as 200,000 impressions before
cleanup is required. This is above the press run per edition of most news-
papers, and will likely stimulate further conversion from letterpress to
offset newspaper printing. It is judged that the present generation of
twin-wire formers is sufficiently well established and proven to be utilized
in this project.

TURKEY
BALIKESIR NEWSPRINT PROJECT
PROJECT SITE AND RELATED FACTORS
Site
1.        The mill will be located in a rural area on a 180 ha site 12 km
southeast of the city of Balikesir on the main highway to Izmir. The site
is well-suited to the project and ample for any foreseeable future expansion.
SEKA purchased the site in 1971 for a bleached sulphate pulp mill and began
construction of a housing colony and other preparatory work on the site.
This work ceased when it became apparent that the mill could not be built
because of the relatively high pollution level associated with bleached
chemical pulpmills and the lack of major streams in the area that could
assimilate treated effluents.
2.        Site preparation work was resumed in early 1975 following SEKA's
decision to utilize the site for this project. At the time of the appraisal
mission (November 1975), the housing colony, including a guest house and a
small office, was nearing completion. Work was well under way on several
required non-process mill buildings such as offices and worker facilities.
A central oil-fired 3-boiler steam heating plant to heat the buildings under
construction and those completed until the main steam plant comes into opera-
tion in 1979 was ready to start. About 20 families were already living
in the housing colony, consisting of single detached houses for management
level staff, duplexes, and multi-family apartment buildings. Site grading,
road construction and drainage work in preparation for construction of the
main mill buildings was also under way.
Foundation Conditions
3.        Soil investigations were carried out for SEKA in 1971 by two
Turkish organizations. Soil data was obtained from 17 holes drilled to
depths varying between 20 to 50 meters in that part of the site whose topo-
graphy is favored for mill construction. Groundwater was encountered over
the area, ranging in depth below the surface at the annual peak following
the rainy season from 0.5 m near the highway to 5.5 m at the higher eleva-
tions away from the highway. The drainage plan now being installed will
lower the water table to an acceptable level. The investigators judged
that the area examined is suitable for the erection of industrial buildings
supported on footings which are placed at depths of 1.5 to 2.0 m below the
surface of the silt and clay which starcs about 1 m below the surface; this
may have to be increased to 4 m depth in some places due to the presence
of loose material. The opinion contains qualifications; extraordinary
concentrations of loads should be avoided in certain areas, and there may
be substantial swelling pressures in placing foundations during spells of



ANNEX 4-5
Page 2
wet weather. The presence of artesian water is not considered to present
any problems because it only exists at considerable depths (below 100 m).
4.        While these limited investigations are sufficient as a basis for
the decision to utilize the site, the consulting engineers recognize that
further detailed soil investigation work is required after a tentative loca-
tion of major process structures and a definition of specific foundation
loading conditions has been decided. The field work for the detailed soil
investigations has been completed and evaluation of the results is under
way. The area under the newsprint machine, which will be 80 m long, is
particularly critical. The foundation conditions under this machine must
be uniform in order to avoid differential settlements, which would throw
the machine out of alignment and interfere with operation. SEKA has a paper
machine at its Dalaman mill which is experiencing differential settlement,
and is well aware of the problems this can cause.
Earthquakes
5.        Except for a small segment along the Syrian border, Turkey is a
part of the Alpine-Himalayan mountain belt. The intensive folding and up-
lifting of this belt during the Tertiary period was followed by intensive
faulting during the Quarternary period. This faulting is still in progress,
and Turkey is one of the ranking earthquake regions of the world. The major
fault line runs inland from the Sea of Marmara in the general direction of
Ankara. A number of major earthquakes affecting the Balikesir region have
been recorded in modern times. In recent years, a quake of 7th degree in-
tensity occurred on September 14, 1962. All building structures and equip-
ment will be designed to suitably withstand the forces unleashed by major
earthquakes.
Transportation
6.        The State Railway connects Balikesir to Bandirma on the Sea of
Marmara, to Izmir on the Aegean Sea, and to Eskisehir to the east. How-
ever, it is SEKA's experience that highway transport is much more rapid and
reliable, and therefore no rail connection is planned for the project at
present. Should the situation change in the future, only 6 km of rail would
need to be laid over favorable terrain.
Water Supply
7.        The plant is expected to require water at the rate of 40 m3 /ton
of newsprint produced, an amount that has remained fairly constant in newl-
print manufacture for many years. This translates into a flow of 0.133 m /s
of water. Both groundwater and surface water are available in the vicinity
of the site. A 150 m deep well has been drilled at the south end of the mill-
site next to the highway. The well is artesian, and is ample for the needs



ANNEX 4-5
Page 3
of the housing colony. However, it is not known whether groundwater can be
obtained near the millsite in quantities adequate for the project. Rather
than go to the expense of a test drilling program, and because of the ready
availability of surface water, SEKA has decided to rely on surface water
for the project.
8.        The only river of significance in the Balikesir regisn is the
Simav, whose average recorded flow at a nearby station is 26 m Is. The
Simav flows northward about 10 km east of the millsite, and is joined by
a tributary, the Atnos, which flows near the millsite. The State Hydraulic
Works (DSI) has under development a water storage, irrigation canal and
distribution system to serve the needs of agriculture in the Simav basin.
The largest storage dam for the system, the Menent Dam, located upstream
from Balikesir, was completed in 1970. Two other smaller dams are planned
for tributaries of the Atnos for completion in 1985. These will add to
surface water availability in the vicinity of the millsite. Water from
the Simav for the Balikesir irrigation system will be drawn from the Kaletepe
Diversion Dam currently under construction at a point about 10 km upstream
from the confluence with the Atnos; construction is scheduled for comple ion
by the end of 1976.  The DSI has granted SEKA a water use permit for 1 m  Is,
which is 7-1/2 times the initial requirement, so there is ample water for
future expansion of the project. SEKA will obtain the necessary rights of way
along DSI's main irrigation canal from the Kaletepe Diversion Dam, where SEKA
plans a pumping station, for a pipeline to the plant about 15 km long.
Although the irrigation canal passes near the plant, it cannot be tapped by
SEKA for water supply because the canal is emptied for cleaning when irriga-
tion is not in progress. The water requires little treatment for process use.
Treatment will consist of settling in two settling basins at the plant, so
that one can be cleaned while the other is in use.
Electric Power Supply
9.        The manufacture of newsprint is by far the largest energy user in
the pulp and paper industry because of its high mechanical pulp content. It
is estimated that this project will consume 3,500 kWh per ton of newsprint
produced, excluding the small amount used by the sawmill. It is expected
that the project will have an average demand of 44 MW and a normal peak demand
of 55 MW. The electric power supply will be sized accordingly, with ample
provision for unusual peak demands and future load growth. Experience shows
that electric power demand grows in a pulp and paper mill without expansion
through the addition of technological improvements. SEKA has therefore
obtained a tentative commitment from TEK for 60 MW, subject to negotiation of
a definitive contract.



ANNEX 4-5
Page 4
10.       TEK is capable of supplying this demand from the national grid
through its Balikesir substation by means of a 12 km transmission line to
be built for the project. However, TEK has a long history of voltage and
frequency variations and power outages that make the operation of continuous
process plants such as this one difficult and expensive. Sudden voltage and
frequency changes are sufficient to cause the paper web to break in the
newsprint machine. Usually around half an hour is required for clean up so
that the newsprint machine can be rethreaded. An unscheduled power outage is
even worse because then the pulp slurry spills onto the floor, in addition to
the aforementioned problem. SEKA has long experience with this failing of
TEK, and is insistent upon having at least some in-house electric power
generation. However, in this project, because there is no chemical pulp mill,
process steam requirements are low, so that about 5 MW can normally be genera-
ted on a non-condensing basis. Nonetheless, SEKA is buying a 9.25 MW non-
condensing turbogenerator. While operating tied-in with the TEK system, this
installation will provide some measure of voltage regulation and will generate
5 MW. During TEK outages, the installation will operate at its rated capacity
and will be sufficient to keep the newsprint machine operating as long as
there is prepared pulp available, perhaps an hour or two. During such opera-
tion, nearly half the steam passing through the turbogenerator will either
have to be passed to a dump condenser to recover the condensate, or be vented
to the atmosphere. The latter alternative would required an increase in the
size of the boiler feedwater treatment plant to make up for the vented steam.
SEKA has a similar installation at its Aksu mill in which the excess steam is
vented. SEKA's consulting engineers are studying which alternative is appro-
priate for this project.

BALIKESIR NEWSPRINT PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND PROTECTION
General
1.        The principal source of air and water pollution in the pulp and
paper industry lies in the manufacture of chemical pulp, which will not be
produced in this project. The project consists only of sawmilling, mech-
anical pulp manufacture and newsprint manufacture, none of which have major
effects upon the environment. SEKA's consultants investigated every con-
ceivable facet of the project's effect upon the environment. There is no
conflict with tourism, because there is little to attract tourists to the
Balikesir region. No unique or rare animal species or other wildlife are
reported in this area, so there is no conflict with wildlife. The area
near the millsite is mainly farmland and a few farm villages. The mill
townsite, already partly constructed, has been carefully planned and in-
cludes a social center, day care center, medical facilities and housing for
1,000 people. Total employment at the mill will be 850 people which could
require housing for some 3,000 people including families. However, many of
the plant employees will be hired from the Balikesir area, and will likely
continue in their present housing. The mill townsite is intended primarily
for personnel from SEKA's Aksu plant and elsewhere in Turkey and overseas.
The close proximity of the mill and townsite to the city of Balikesir (popu-
lation 85,000 and 12 km. away) will minimize any adverse social impact on
the area.
Noise
2.        The noise of the mill is not considered a problem.  Equipment will
be ordered with internationally accepted noise control features. Other than
the mill townsite, there are no residential or commercial areas located close
to the millsite where noise could be a problem. Most of the housing colony is
at least partially shielded fiom the plant by a hill and the offices, worker
facilities and social center. Also, the main mill axis goes through the
housing colony, so that most of the noise will be radiated at 900 to the
housing colony.
Air Emissions
3.        Emissions to the atmosphere are not expected to be a serious
problem. Steam will be visible in colder weather from the drying of news-
print, and occasionally when excess low-pressure process steam is vented



ANNEX 4-6
Page 2
from the turbogenerator, but this presents nothing more than a possible
aesthetic problem. The steam plume will be too low to possibly interfere
with the operation of the Balikesir airport located 6 km toward the prevail-
ing wind. The fuel for the power boilers will be bark and wastewood in one
and residual fuel oil in the other. Cyclones will be provided for the exit
gases to minimize emissions of fly ash. There will be sulphur dioxide in
the exist gases to the extent that sulphur is received in the fuel oil. The
amount of sulphur in the fuel oil is outside the control of SEKA, but rather
depends upon whatever fuel oil is available in Turkey. There is also the
possibility of a slight odor from the wastewater treatment plant, particular-
ly if it is improperly operated. The prevailing winds, however, blow away
from inhabited areas, so this is not expected to be a problem.
Effluent Treatment and Disposal
4.        Theoretically, it should be possible to operate the project without
any process effluent, because the amount of water entering the process in
the raw materials is less than that evaporated in the drying of newsprint.
However, this is not possible under the present state of the art for several
reasons. Maximum possible reuse is made in the plant of once-used waters,
but these generally contain fine wood fibers, and even some synthetic fibers
from press felts. There are places in the plant where only clear fresh water
can be used. Further, excessive reuse of water leads to slime growth pro-
blems that cannot be held in check with the biodegradable slimicides avail-
able; stronger slimicides such as mercury compounds are no longer permitted
for health reasons. Slime cannot be tolerated in the newsprint because it
makes holes in the sheet in passing through the press rolls. Lastly, certain
chemicals (such as alum and mechanical pulp brighteners) and color bodies
leached out of the pulpwood would build up in the recycled water and lower
the quality of the newsprint produced. Because of the relatively low
pollution load from mechanical pulp and newsprint manufacture, there is
little motivation to improve the pollution aspects of the process.
5.        No pulping chemicals are used in the project, but small amounts
of biodegradable slimicides, mechanical pulp brightening chemicals, and
alum will be used. About 5% of the wood input is lost in the wastewater,
consisting of wood sugars, pentosans and lignin, which will slightly dis-
color the effluenc. About 2% of the fiber is lost in papermaking and appears
in the effluent in finely divided form. These items then constitute the
harmful constituents of the effluent. SEKA's consultants estimate that
these constituents can be measured as 5-day Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5)
and as suspended solids, each at a level of 18 kg per ton of newsprint.
6.        The planned effluent treatment system would contain both primary
and secondary treatment facilities. The primary system would consist of a
clarifier followed by two settling basins in parallel, designed to effect
95% removal of suspended solids. The clarifier sludge would be dewatered



ANNEX 4-6
Page 3
by vacuum filtration and disposed of by land fill. The secondary treat-
ment facility would consist of an aerated lagoon (220m x 140m x 4.5m) con-
taining 10 mechanical surface aerators. The plant would be designed for
95% BOD   reduction.  In order to reach this removal efficiency, nutrients
5
would be required for the micro-organisms in the amount of 2.0 kg of
nitrogen and 0.5 kg of phosphorus for every 100 kg of BOD   removed.
The predicted influent and effluent characteristics for the complete
wastewater treatment plant may be summarized as follows:
Predicted Influent and Effluent Characteristics
Flow                    BOD               Suspended Solids
(m  /day)   (m  /s)    ]Mg/l   kg/day           mg/i       kg/day
Influent  11,400       0.13       500    5,700           500        5,700
Effluent  11,400        0.13        25      280           25          280
7.        The consultants considered several alternatives for the disposal
of the treated effluent: irrigation canal (effluent suitable, but season
limited), year round disposal on land (uncertainties), disposal to tributaries
of the Simav (too low assimilative capacity at times), and disposal to the
Simav at the confluence with the Atnos, where the Simav has the greatest
flow near Balikesir. Only here can the Simav safely assimilate the effluent,
where the minimum expected dilution factor is 14 to 1. This will require a
pipeline 14 km long. Surface water is not used for drinking anywhere in the
Simav basin near Balikesir because there is an adequate supply of better
quality water from natural springs and wells.

TRAINING, MANAGEMENT AND OPERATING ASSISTANCE
1.        Training, management and operating assistance will be provided by
Sandwell Management Consultants Ltd., an affiliate of SEKA's consulting
engineers. In the past, SEKA has relied entirely on equipment manufacturers
for start-up assistance. While this is needed, it is inadequate for proper
training. The purpose of this program is to assist SEKA with the preparation
for the start-up, the commissioning of the mill and the training of SEKA's
technical and management personnel to satisfactory levels of proficiency so
that optimum levels of production and efficiency will be reached in the
shortest possible time. A contract between Sandwell and SEKA dated April 3,
1975 goes into considerable detail as to the scope of the assistance program;
the number, qualifications, time required, job titles and job description of
the consultants' personnel; the establishment of the organization management
structure; details of the training functions; the compiling of operating and
maintenance manuals; the establishment of policies and procedures; the writing
of specifications for raw materials and finished products; assistance during
start-up and acceptance tests; and the provision of supporting services and
project direction from Sandwell's head office in Vancouver, Canada.
2.        The contract provides for the following staffing by Sandwell, to
whom SEKA will assign counterpart staff capable of absorbing the training to
be provided by the expatriates so that the Turkish staff can assume operating
responsibility as rapidly as possible. Should the Turkish staff not be fully
trained by the time their expatriate counterparts are scheduled to leave,
SEKA willl consult with the Bank prior to July 31, 1979 the departure of the
first expatriate, on the advisability of extending the training program.

BALIKESIR NEWSPRINT PROJECT
ADJUSTMENT OF CAPITAL AND MANUFACTURING COSTS
FOR ECONOMIC EVALUATION
1.        Detailed adjustments to the financial capital and manufacturing
costs of the project to convert them into their economic values are shown
below. For imported goods the c.i.f. border price, expressed in local cur-
rency at the official exchange rate has been used, for exported goods the
f.o.b. price. The financial cost of non-traded goods has been converted
into its border price equivalent through the application of conversion fac-
tors. Where no specific conversion factor was available, the Standard Con-
version Factor (SCF) has been used, which has been estimated at 0.82 for
Turkey 1/. In terms of the corresponding traditional practice, this implies
a shadow exchange rate of TL 19.5 per US$1. Unskilled labor has been valued
at a shadow wage rate of 43% of its financial cost, but the cost of this
labor is only a small fraction of the total cost.
2.        The economic value of the capital cost amounts to 89% of the finan-
cial cost. The economic value of manufacturing costs (at full capacity utili-
zation) amounts to 81% of the financial costs.
1/   The Standard Conversion Factor represents the weighted average of the ratios
of the international prices, expressed in local currency at the official
exchange rate, to the domestic prices, for a wide range of goods.
