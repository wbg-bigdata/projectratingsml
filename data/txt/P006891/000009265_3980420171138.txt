Implementation Guidelines and Procedures:
SEDUCA designed flexible procedures that would guide subproject appraisal, implementation, and evaluation. The
operational manuals and standard agreements (Convenio del Colegio y Convenio SEDUCA) will guide the respective
functions and responsibilities at the departmental, municipal, and school levels. The legal ratification of the operational
manuals and the submission for Bank review of the standard agreements are conditions of project effectiveness.
The operational manuals provide a transparent guide for all executing agencies. The content of the manuals includes: (i)
general information and promotion; (ii) subproject presentation and appraisal; (iii) technical, social, institutional, and
financial feasibility criteria and tools; (iii) administrative, procurement, and financial management; and (iv) supervision,
monitoring, and evaluation.
Finally, SEDUCA would distribute, upon request from participating municipalities, technical assistance documents and
guides, including standards and quality criteria for the hiring of consultant services, technical standards for infrastructure
investments, and guides for subcontracting education services with NGOs.
Accounting, financial reporting, and auditing arrangements (see Annex 7):
SEDUCA will keep project accounts and provide financial reports to the Bank. Municipalities and schools participating
in the project will maintain their own respective accounting and financial files.
Administrative, procurement and technical audits, in addition to community oversights (veedurias), will provide
feedback on implementation procedures of municipal and school/community subprojects, and on physical progress
(including construction, services provided, and goods delivered). Communities will be informed of the objectives,
activities, and financial resources provided by the project for their schools/communities and municipalities (e.g., through
periodic newsletters, bulletins, and/or other publications). For overall project implementation, external audit reports
prepared by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank would be submitted annually in accordance with Bank
standards.
Project Implementation Cycle:
The project will be executed through a learning cycle. The three learning phases are: experimentation, demonstration,
and generalization. SEDUCA will be responsible for documenting the lessons learned during implementation and
providing appropriate adjustments and policy guidance. Although the project expects to intervene in approximately 80
municipalities during its implementation life, participation will be gradual to support the learning cycle, as indicated in
Annex 2, Component 2.
Municipalities, within each socioeconomic level, will be selected competitively. The selection criteria will include
educational needs, as well as regional representation. The first pilot municipalities will also be selected by their
institutional capacity to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of their subprojects, and to disseminate lessons to other
municipalities.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements (see Annex 8):
The project includes a process evaluation and a summative evaluation (impact). The process evaluation will provide
information for changes required between each project implementation phase. At the departmental level, SEDUCA will
be responsible for overall monitoring of project processes. The evaluation process will not imply micro-managing nor
overseeing compliance with procedures. Project monitoring will focus on outputs/results and will attempt to learn from
these and adjust project design accordingly. Municipalities and schools, in turn, will also monitor their own subprojects.
Impact indicators include student leaming and learning-related independent factors (such as school climate and changes
in teaching and learning attitudes). To guarantee enough time to assess project impact, the impact evaluation in terms of
student learning will take place during the latter implementation phase of the project and within the Implementation
Completion Report (ICR).
SEDUCA and the Bank would jointly conduct a Midterm Review of the project and subprojects by December 1999.

A beie)sprd ero   CO 6/11/97 (Presented Concurrently with this Project to the
Board).
Colombia's Country Appraisal Strategies (CASs) of 1993 and 1997 recognize that the country's still unequally low levels
of educational attainment and coverage, primarily in poor and rural communities, adversely affect development in this
country. The 1997 CAS puts a stronger emphasis on successfully implementing Colombia's decentralization and
community participation policies. In the education sector, the focus is on expanding access and improving quality
through education services provided at the municipal level, and with increased school autonomy and greater community
and private sector participation. By transferring education responsibilities to the departments and municipalities,
decisionmaking at the local level can more accurately reflect the needs of the users, adequately attend to regional
diversities, and also increase accountability. As one of the two pilots testing decentralization strategies at the
departmental and municipal levels, the project provides decentralization design and implementation lessons from the
ground up as input for a national decentralization strengthening strategy. The project fully supports the CAS objectives.

6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
National Policies: Local Government and Community Management of the Education System
a) National and local governments emphasize social programs, as reflected in the national development plan (Salto
Social), and the national education plan, (Salto Educativo). The Salto Social's objectives include social development,
the competitiveness of the economy, the environment, and decentralization and institutional strengthening. The Salto
Educativo calls for the transferring of education management responsibilities to departments and municipalities To
enable regional governments to operate in the new decentralized environment, the national government fully supports
strengthening the capacity of local education agencies as part of its strategy to improve access and quality of
education. By making education management local, the possibilities for resource mobilization, cost sharing, and
greater community and parental involvement are enhanced.
Decentralization Background
b) The decentralization process in Colombia was initiated in 1968 through an effort to deconcentrate the Ministry .f
Education (MOE) to local organization, though MOE maintained veto power over them. In 1971, an education tax
allowance (the Situado Fiscal) earmarked national government expenditures and sales taxes for educational purposes.
The Regional Education Funds (Fondos Educativos Regionales, FER) were institutions created as a hybrid system
intended basically to deconcentrate the payroll of national and nationalized teachers, with a highly centralized control
of how the funds could be used. Teacher qualification committees (Juntas de Escalafon Departamental) followed to
guarantee minimum standards. Since the 1980s, the stated policy objective has been to give local governments the
power to manage their educational systems. Local fiscal autonomy however, was not supported until the late 1980s
when new measures began to increase local revenues (tax and nontax). The law requiring the election of mayors to
increase their accountability to the community facilitated fiscal decentralization. The Constitution of 1991 increased
local responsibility in the delivery of social services and distributed administrative functions at different levels.
Municipal governments have experienced a sharp increase in local revenues -- from 2 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP) in 1980 to 3.5 percent in 1994.
Original Decentralization Implementation Strategy
c) While important decentralization advances took place, the central government had continued to control partially the
national education investment budget. The cofinancing system remained overly centralized and bureaucratic, citing
low local capacity to justify restraining funds and slowing disbursements. Also, large institutional development
investments provided only centrally delivered training and sporadic technical assistance. Local processes of
leadership, autonomy, participation, and innovation went largely untapped. This incompletely implemented
decentralization strategy did not contribute to improving the quality indicators of the education system: an average
Colombian student still takes seven years to complete the first five years of primary school. While 87 percent of
students complete all five grades, 19.5 percent do so only after repeating three or more grades. Only half of those

students entering sixth grade reach the eleventh grade five years later, and most of them are from wealthier families.
The results from the first national assessment of primary education indicates that most third and fifth graders are not
achieving at grade-level in reading comprehension and mathematics.
New Decentralization Implementation Approach
d) Attempting to find new alternatives to successfully achieve the objectives of local government and community
management of the education system, the central government initiated a process of transferring fiscal management to
Departments and large municipalities (populations over 100,000). This process is called "certification." In this
context, certified local governments are fully responsible for planning education investments, managing the situado
fiscal (mostly funds for recurrent costs and teacher salaries), identifying additional sources of investment financing,
and implementing and evaluating their own improvement projects.
e) Moreover, to strengthen local management and decisionmaking, the national government is supporting the provision
of multilateral funds directly to local governments. It is expected this strategy also would improve the efficiency of
investments supported by international development organizations. A municipality and a department were selected
to participate in a pilot program and the World Bank was approached to support this innovation. This pilot operation,
directly designed and implemented by local governments, would provide lessons to a nationwide system of technical
and management capacity strengthening and decentralized financing of capital investments. The key criteria used for
selection of the participating local governments included: financial indebtedness capacity, regional and
socioeconomic representation, and political commitment. Financial sustainability was weighted heavily, since the
central Government seeks to encourage fiscal discipline at the local government levels. Socioeconomic
representation guaranteed equity considerations. Political will is key to any major sector reform and learning
strategy. The Department of Antioquia, in the central region of Colombia, and the Municipality of Pasto, in the
Andean Highlands, were selected.
Main Sector Issues in the Department of Antioquia
General Situation
f) The Department of Antioquia and its capital city, Medellin, have been cultural and economic leaders in Colombia.
Antioquia has improved extensively its infrastructure, roads, and communication systems. For example, Medellin is
the only city in Colombia with a Metro system -- which is proving to be financially sustainable. At the same time, the
Department is also one of the most afflicted by poverty and violence. Out of approximately 5 million, 27 percent of
the population live under the poverty line and 5 percent more in extreme poverty. The extreme violence is reflected
in its high mortality rate due to homicide: 206 per 100,000 inhabitants. In 1993, homicides was the leading cause of
death with almost 10,000 killings.
Education Statistics
g) The deteriorating social fabric has affected the education system. Antioquia's public education graduates are
achieving under the national averages: 74 percent of its eleventh graders receive low scores in the secondary school
exiting exam (ICFES) in comparison to a national average of 54 percent. Only 12 percent of eleventh graders achieve
high scores, while the national average is 17 percent. Of 100 children who enroll at the primary level, only 59 percent
complete primary education. Only 35 percent of these children finish without repeating a grade. Dropouts and
repetitions have an impact in the efficient use of education resources. It requires 7.3 school years for each student to
finish 5 grades of primary education, and 17 years to complete the ninth grade. Other factors associated to low
achievement and high dropouts and repetitions include the status of teacher development, teaching content,
educational materials, infrastructure, management, and participation.
Teaching Staff
h) Almost 70 percent of teachers in Antioquia have completed preservice training (teacher preparation at the secondary
level and/or university). However, there is a deficit of teachers in certain teaching areas (e.g., science, mathematics,).
In-service teacher training does not necessarily focus on classroom application. Nevertheless, isolated training
courses and irrelevant topics still provide teachers with escalaf6n credits (option for higher pay scale). As a result,
the Escalaf6n system is being reformed to guarantee relevant training and classroom application. Additionally, the

Project Appraisal Document
ANTIOQUIA, COLOMBIA                                                               Antioguia Basic Education Project
national and local government are piloting nonsalary incentives programs, which have yielded early results.
Curriculum
i) School curriculum was designed and programmed centrally in Bogota, the nation's capital. The selection,
procurement and delivery of textbooks (and other instructional materials) was also centralized. The content of what
was taught in the classroom was often unrelated to the realities and needs of the diverse communities in Colombia.
The Department of Antioquia, itself, is very heterogeneous: the Afro-Colombian culture of the coasts, the coffee
producers of the midlands, the isolated rural/peasant towns, and the violence prone communities of UrabA and
Magdalena Medio. Thus, during the 1990s, decentralized decisionmaking on curriculum issues has been increasing.
The national and local education policies aim to provide a margin of choice for curriculum content. The basic
curriculum areas will be maintained and strengthened, but local governments have the opportunity to add content
areas relevant to their socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds.
School Infrastructure
j)  School infrastructure is insufficient and deteriorating. Urban areas, especially in the Metropolitan Area formed by 10
adjacent municipalities, experience a high deficit of school slots for students. Over 500 primary and secondary urban
schools have double and triple usage (morning, afternoon, and nights). Low scores in ICFES exams can be correlated
with students in the afternoon and night shifts. Students graduating at the primary level may not find a place at lower
secondary, and similarly between lower and upper secondary. School access is even lower in rural areas. While urban
public education coverage is 88 percent, it is only 53 percent in rural areas. Most critically, in 1994, rural preschool
coverage was only 19 percent, lower secondary 23 percent, and upper secondary 7 percent; urban percentages were
65 percent, 97 percent, and 59 percent, respectively.
Management of the Sector
k) The Department of Antioquia and its municipalities seek to implement successfully their respective education
management responsibilities (identified in the Constitution of 1991 and the Laws 60/93 and 115/94). That is, (i) the
Nation formulates education policies and provides general financing, technical assistance, and national evaluations;
(ii) the Department of Antioquia plans and cofinances education development objectives, manages nationally
provided fiscal resources (the situado fiscal) for municipalities with low capacity, and assists municipalities in
managing their own education services; (iii) the 125 Municipalities would execute and manage the educational
policies, cofinance local investments, and monitor and support their schools; and (iv) Antioquia's 6,700 schools and
their communities are entitled to develop and implement their own development plans and construct complementary
course contents specific to their communities. Additional education management subdivisions in Antioquia include 9
subregions and 239 local administrative offices, or nicleos.
I) The execution of the respective education management roles described above is still incipient at each level in
Antioquia, though some advances have been made. The Department has been certified to administer its situado
fiscal. To further the decentralization process within the Department, Antioquia aims at increasing the education
management capacity of all its municipalities. Three municipalities (Bello, Itagui, and Medellin) can be certified by
the Nation to autonomously manage their own situadofiscal. Antioquia would delegate the management of
teachers, curriculum and school infrastructure, and the respective financial resources, to most of its municipalifes.
Although, teacher training has remained a departmental level responsibility, the Department will provide its
municipalities with the opportunity to identify their own training needs and interventions. Initially, 53 municipalities
have been confirmed to initiate the delegation process. Finally, apart from the situado fiscal, the national government
also transfers complementary investment funds (Ingresos Corrientes Nacionales, or ICN), directly to all
municipalities. Municipalities must invest at least 30 percent of the ICN in education.

7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
A recent study of decentralization in Colombia (Decentralizaci6n de los Servicios de Educaci6n en Colombia, DNP
1997) confirms the need to strengthen school autonomy and the role of municipalities in education management. The
project would be instrumental in testing mechanisms to build the capacity of municipalities to manage the education
sector; provide schools with the autonomy and capacity to plan, implement, and evaluate their own education
development efforts; and improve the allocation of fiscal resources at the local levels.
In addition, the project will provide crucial investments in the Department of Antioquia to address its own issues of
education quality and efficiency (see section 6 above). This investment, thus, serves two major purposes: (i) a full-
fledged education development intervention in Antioquia and a pilot operation to strengthen decentralization nationwide.
The specific sector issues addressed are:
At the School Level
a) (i) increasing community participation in school activities and vice versa (i.e., schools involved in community
events); (ii) improving the skills of administrative and teaching staff; (iii) complementing course contents with topics
related to the culture and socioeconomic needs of each community; (iv) providing financing for self-identified
improvements in school infrastructure and instructional materials; and (v) improving teachers' status, morale and
effectiveness in the classroom
At the Municipal Level
b) (i) strengthening the management capacity of municipal level education offices; and (iii) increasing coverage (mainly
at the preschool and lower-secondary level) through altemative strategies based on municipal needs (e.g., school
cunstruction, contracts with NGOs and/or rural strategies).
At the Departmental level
c) Strengthening the new role of the Department's Secretariat of Education as strategic planner, advisor, and facilitator;
improving departmental collection and analysis of education statistics; and promoting education reforms and positive
behavioral and attitudinal change through a department wide information, education, and communication campaign
in alliance with the media and pro bono recognized role models (actors, athletes, singers).
Strategic Choices:
d) The project design process considered four key strategic choices: (i) national versus local responsibility for project
design, financing, and implementation; (ii) centralized (at the departmental level) versus decentralized
(municipalities and schools/communities) decisionmaking; (iii) public (SEDUCA) versus private provision of
services (NGOs, Universities and Firms); and (iv) low (information sharing and consultation) versus high (self-
management and decision control) participatory approaches.
National versus Local Projects
e) Projects to support local governments have been implemented by central institutions. However, centralized channels
were overly bureaucratic. Top-down mechanisms from a distant central government have diluted the expected impact
of investments. The alternative choice considered was to finance and prepare projects directly with approved
decentralized local governments. This approach provided the opportunity to implement a strategy that aims at
enhancing responsiveness, client orientation, and innovation.
Centralized versus Decentralized Decisionmaking
f) The choices for decisionmaking vacillated between (i) local needs assessment by municipalities and schools, but
specific interventions defined at the departmental level (including procurement and contracting); and (ii) full
responsibility at the municipal and school levels in managing their own specific project outputs and services and final
allocation of resources. In line with the decentralization policies and its own objective to strengthen municipal and

community management of schools, the project opted for the latter alternative.
Public versus Private Provision of Services
g) Initial consideration was given to the provision of technical assistance, training, and other services by the
Departmental Secretariat of Education. However, the experience in Colombia and elsewhere recommended a wider
choice of service providers, including the private and NGO sectors. Antioquia's universities, foundations, NGOs, and
consulting firms have the experience and capacity to provide a full range of services at the school/community,
municipal, and departmental levels. Moreover, in various instances, these institutional actors have formed public-
private alliances to combine their own strengths effectively.
Low versus High Participatory Approach
h) Participation has been key to project preparation and implementation. However, there were still choices as to the
level of participation expected of municipalities, schools, and communities. The choices included emphasis on (i)
information sharing and consultation (surveys, focus groups, public notices, town meetings, and incorporation of
opinions) or (ii) collaboration and empowerment (self-management and decisionmaking). The latter choice was
selected.
i) Change management experiences within organizations and larger systems have shown that successful reforms are
correlated to high participation of local stakeholders, managers, and staff in planning, decisiomnaking,
implementation, and evaluation of their own initiatives and activities. Additionally, a successful management change
effort must provide the-needed financial resources to promote innovation and team and knowledge building.
Promotion and implementation of changes in management policies and procedures must be accompanied by direct
access to resources.

8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Identification of Municipal Level Educational Investments (Necesidades Educativas Bdsicas Inmediatas -- NEBIs)
Alternatives Rejected:
Financing education investment needs in specific municipalities already identified by the Department
(called NEBIs). NEBIs included: (i) investing in the creation of additional school places for poor preschool
children and sixth graders in high-quality, nonprofit and religious schools; (ii) constructing and
rehabilitating school buildings in rural areas; (iii) piloting the national reform of teacher training secondary
schools and university programs; and (iv) laying the basic infrastructure for information systems between
municipalities and the department.
This alternative was rejected because the department identified specific investments for its municipalities, thus,
not allowing municipal capacity building in planning and implementing their own education investments.
Alternative Selected:
Financing quality investment subprojects identified and prepared at the municipal level. The investments would
still focus on financing the above-mentioned NEBIs. However, the decisionmaking on the specific mix and
amounts would remain in the municipality.
Increasing Student Access
Alternatives Rejected:
*  Financing the construction of already identified schools in various municipalities in Antioquia.
* Continuing to finance school vouchers already being provided by the Department.
These alternatives were rejected because they did not provide municipalities with the choice of the most

ANTIOQUIA, COLOMBIA                                                               Antiogula Basic Education Project
compatible strategy to increase student access. For example, school vouchers could not be used in rural and
isolated communities because of lack of private service providers; these municipalities could opt instead for rural
strategies such as Escuela Nueva and the Sistema de Aprendizaje Tutorial (a secondary education rural tutorial
program). Similarly, larger municipalities with budget constraints may opt to finance school places with
nonprofit private schools rather than making large capital investments in school constructions and incurring
mandatory recurrent costs.
Alternative Selected
Through the financing of Municipal Education Investment Plans provide choices and municipal decisionmaking
as to the best strategy to increase school access. In addition, the Department will transfer technical know-how
(e.g., criteria and manuals to subcontract student places with NGOs; mechanisms to assess the fiscal
sustainability of school construction; and guidelines to establish rural education programs, such as Escuela
Nueva and SAT).
Educational Technology
Alternatives Rejected
* Finance an education technology program through a single source contract with a local university; and
* Prefinance SEDUCA-specified technology training, computer equipment and software for schools.
The alternatives were rejected because they did not take advantage of various high quality educational
technology programs in the country. Further, the type and amount of investments at the school and municipal
level was already identified at the Departmental level.
Alternative Selected:
Offer a choice of a special education technology program that offers financing, technical assistance, minimum
quality standards, selection criteria, and choice of different quality education technology programs already
offered by NGOs, universities and the public sector, including SEDUCA's own program.
School-Level Educational Inputs
Alternatives Rejected:
* Finance predetermined training programs in curriculum and management of schools, and
* Centrally contracting school refurbishments and assessment of school needs.
These two alternatives were rejected because they were not congruent with the capacity building objectives of the
educational policies and of the project. Also, experience with centrally provided services -- albeit with local
participation in needs assessment and planning (but with central implementation -- e.g., contracting, managing
resources) -- was unsatisfactory. Economies of scale by procuring centrally were not achieved: inef5icient
distribution; late use of inputs and even nondelivery implied higher costs. High unquantifiable costs were also
incurred by loss of motivation of local actors and negative image of nondelivering projects. Community
preinvestment in planing time and local inputs became unrecoverable (sunk) costs.
Alternative Selected
Financing demand-based school and community subprojects. The demand-based School-Community
Strengthening Program will provide a flexible mechanism to finance investments needs as they arise during the
reform period. In addition, commitment and community responsibility will be created by empowering schools
and communities to manage their own resources and implementing their own projects. Community-based
monitoring and clear and transparent procedures will minimize risks of misuse of funds and inefficiencies.

Project Management and Implementation:
Alternatives Rejected:
* Centrally managed project implementation (e.g., procurement, financing, monitoring).
*  Creation of a Project Implementation Unit to manage the project.
These two alternative were rejected because of Colombia's poor experience with large project implementation
units. These units become isolated and overcontrolling, and the project is hardly incorporated into the day-to-day
operations of the executing agencies. Resistance and mistrust is felt by government staff who are not
participating in project implementation and, thus, capacity-building in public agencies is not achieved. Moreover,
the traditional rationale of economies of scale from centralized procurement management was not realized
because of cumbersome procurement and financing procedures, controlled and understood only by a very small
administrative elite hired within the PIU.
Alternative Selected:
Relying in the internal structure of SEDUCA and local municipalities to self-manage and coordinate the project.
The project design introduces capacity-building investments not for large management reforms, but to strengthen
the staff and management systems necessary to manage the project. This strategy, in turn, will contribute to
SEDUCA's overall management efficiency. With the respective division of SEDUCA, a small administrative
team will be created to support the added administration needs of managing a World Bank-provided loan (e.g.,
reporting, accounting, Bank procurement methods). All other management and technical assistance will be
provided by the respective division of SEDUCA and the Municipalities.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Based on the Bank's experience in financing social sector projects in Colombia, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC),
and in other regions, critical success factors are:
i) decentralization projects should not provide solely technical assistance to strengthen the legislative an4
structural frameworks of education systems;
ii) Decentralization investments should systematically address strengthening of (i) the organization and
structure of the education system, (ii) management change and human resources, and (iii) identification and
solution of conflict of interest across levels and key stakeholders;
iii) Centrally prepared and managed decentralization investments (maintaining political and fiscal controls) are
not conducive to flexibility, management capacity building and local decisionmaking;
iv) Strong local participation is critical for all stages of local govemment and school subprojects (e.g.,
promotion, management of resources, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation);
v) Political support and commitment to the goals and the participatory process of the project should be
promoted at all levels of the Government (political leaders, technocrats, and administrators);
vi) Collaboration among public, private and volunteer sectors is critical to ensure complementary objectives
vii) School and community subproject designs should be technically simple and with well-defined appraisal
criteria and transparent allocation of resources;
viii)There should be choice of suppliers for provision of goods, services, and technical assistance (e.g., public
agencies, NGOs, communities, pro bono support, voluntarism); and
ix) Regular and frequent financial and technical audits should complement evaluation of physical progress
(quantity and quality).
The Bank's operations in Colombia in the past reveal:
*  Bank-financed education projects in Colombia, albeit emphasizing decentralization and capacity-building of local
govemments, have been fully designed and managed in the nation's capital. During project implementation, capacity
building programs, financing mechanisms, and monitoring procedures continued to emphasize central controls.
* Departmental and municipal governments have not been entrusted fully with financial resources and decision making
autonomy. As a result, local govemment capacity remained weak or untapped.
Unshared Vision of the Decentralization Process
* A shared vision (i.e., no agreement on goals, roles, and functions; conflicts and power issues not resolved; and lack

of representation and voice of local stakeholders) of the decentralized system had not been consolidated.
*  At the central level, the MOE investments in technical assistance and training were used without a clear
understanding of the new role, objectives, and services to be provided by the MOE within a decentralized framework.
At the regional level, capacity building interventions were carried out in isolation, with limited resources and power
to plan, manage, and implement educational programs. Traditional training and technical assistance programs
provided local government with fixed packages of services as preconditions and prerequisites for any financial
assistance.
Lessons From Unsatisfactory IBRD-Financed Education Projects
*  Specifically, the IBRD-financed Secondary Education Project has experienced major implementation problems. The
key implementing agencies have been the MOE and other central institutions such as the Social Investment Funds
(Fondos de Inversi6n Social, FIS). These institutions are distant from local governments but still guaranteed
themselves a major role in the provision of resources, training and technical assistance to the regions. Preparing a
project centrally implied a highly complex administrative system with decision power remaining in the capital. For
instance, the National Cofinancing System, the financial instrument designed to transfer resources from the national
budget to local governments, has been ineffective in allocating and disbursing funds in a timely manner. The amount
and type of financing was controlled centrally by yearly national allocations (usually released very late in the
implementing fiscal year) to each municipality without input from local governments.
Impact of Decentralized Pilots
* Government and Bank agreement to work, on a pilot basis, with completely autonomous local governments was the
outcome of a year-long negotiation propelled by a seemingly frustrating dead end with centrally designed and
implemented projects. Even at the design stage, the decentralized projects are providing lessons for present
adjustments, in design and procedures, of the Bank's ongoing education portfolio. Consequently, the Government
and the Bank are discussing the key elements necessary to restructure the Secondary Education Project. The
Government has also initiated discussions on dismantling the FIS.
*  Direct operations and financing of local governments' projects provides an opportunity to assess the benefits of
removing rigid budgetary procedures and central control layers. Concurrently, there have been important changes in
the policy and institutional framework: (i) higher priority by the Government of implementing successfully the
decentralization strategy, even if it implies loss of control and functions at the central level; (ii) emphasizing school
autonomy as crucial to the decentralization strategy, and (ii) reducing budgetary controls of funding to municipalities
and school, including block (as oppose to line item) financing. The Government has continued with its broad-based
participatory process for the development of School Education Projects (Proyectos Educativos Institucionales, PEIs),
to foster autonomy and accountability in their execution. Moreover, school-based planning will be complemented
with a serious effort to transfer funds to schools to implement their plans (a missing element in the past).
Articulated Education Portfolio Strategy
*  Various studies in capacity building at the local level have shown that capacity is best achieved by doing and
learning, and by allowing local stakeholders to identify their own weak areas and strengths and, then, to define the
type of technical support, skill, and knowledge required Thus, the Government sees the three education operations
(the restructured Secondary Education Project, Antioquia Department Education Project, and Pasto Municipality
Education Project) as an articulated learning strategy to support the decentralized management of education
investments and guarantee the highest impact.
* The restructured Secondary Education Project will provide learning on a nationwide investment programs still
coordinated by the central Ministry of Education in the Capital, but with strengthened mechanisms to provide the
required decisionmaking and controls at the local levels. Antioquia Education Project will provide the same
investment coordination experience but from the Departmental level. Pasto Education Project will be a case study of
how municipalities can plan, manage and implement their own investment operations. A proposed second phase of
these three operations is expected to incorporate the wealth of knowledge to be generated into a more effective and
efficient system of investment operations in the social sector, especially those financed with loans from multilateral

11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
*  Project preparation led locally with full consideration of quality at entry elements, including the early preparation of
implementation arrangements (such as financial management, implementation manuals, and project administration)
usually addressed much later in the preparation/project effectiveness cycle.
*  The national Government requested Bank support for these operations in various forums including the discussion of
the CAS in preparation. It also expedited loan guarantee procedures.
*  Full central commitment and support to the decentralized project, although it may imply loss of decisionmaking and
control.
*  Fully coordinated technical assistance between central institutions and the departmental government, in such critical
areas as process and impact evaluation and dissemination of lessons learned.
*  Broad participation of stakeholders in project preparation and implementation design.
*  Initial departmental financing of project preparation, in lieu of national or loan advanced funds.
*  Financing a full local team (15 people) from project identification to appraisal to support and accelerate project
preparation.
*  Extensive media coverage of project objectives and educational investments.
12. Value added of Bank support:
.  The Bank's new team approach contributed to a cohesive and integrated assistance strategy for Colombia. It has
supported a shared vision of the decentralization process by: (i) participatorily developing the CAS (which provided
a forum where top stakeholders identified as high priority local government and school/community control of
education investments); (ii) conducting Economic Development Institute (EDI) workshops to facilitate the
identification of interinstitutional conflicts risen from decentralization and identification of tools/strategies to resolve
them; (ii) inviting Colombia and regional governments to participate in EDI's decentralization study tour to New
Zealand and Australia; (iii) support of the Human Development Department (HDrJ) in the preparation of the
education technology investments and collection of international experiences on information, education, and
communication campaigns; and (iv) an committing to the ongoing documentation of project preparation experienice
at the local levels and of nationwide education reforms. In addition:
*  The Bank assisted the Government of Colombia (GOC) in preparing a study of the status of decentralization
implementation in Colombia (Local Government Capacity Building -- Beyond Technical Assistance), which served
as a critical input for the design of the project;
*  The Bank participation has served as a catalyst in the country to test different strategies to implement successfully
Colombia's decentralization and participation policies;
*  The Bank has accumulated much experience in the recent pass on how to prepare and implement projects with
extensive participation and local decisionmaking;
*  The Bank's involvement in the project is expected to provide lessons for other national and international
development agencies; and
*  The decentralized projects would complement the other major activities in the social sector, including the Secondary
Education Project, the Primary Education Project and the Magdalena Medio Project.

NPV=US$
N/A;
ERR= N/A
The justification for public investments is guided by the following considerations: (i) the social rates of return to
education; (ii) the public and private partnership; (iii) the impact on the poor; and (iv) the effectiveness of inputs on
learning outcomes. These are all presented in Annex 4.
Also, the criteria used to guide the choice between different project designs in order to achieve the development objectives
are as follows: (i) least cost estimates; (ii) stakeholder consultations and participatory decisionmaking; (iii) lessons !earned
from previous designs; (iv) study tour to countries with effective decentralization reforms; and (v) institutional capacity.
Annex 4 presents two major alternatives for which the least cost estimate criteria was a decisive element (for other project
design choices see Block 2, section 8): (i) School construction versus contracting with private providers and (ii) centrally
provided training and technical assistance versus block transfers (nonrefundable transfers) to enable beneficiaries to select
private or public services for its own institutional capacity building interventions.

(see Annex 5)
All financial data and fiscal trends of the Department of Antioquia and its municipalities have been collected. Historical
and expected trends in Antioquia's GNP, education budget, and expenditures have been assessed. These figures have been
compared to expected fiscal needs of project investments and recurrent costs at both the departmental and municipa!
levels. Findings show that project impact on departmental and municipal education budgets is sustainable.
Also, a full indebtedness study was done prior to project preparation and was updated prior to the national Government
approval of its guarantee to the loan.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................    ....    ...
15. Technical Assessment:
Technical standards have been developed for each school, community and municipal subprojects. Existing norms and
technical specifications are used for such investments as schools construction, contracting school places with NGOs,
teacher training, and other technical assistance. Technical guides will be prepared by SEDUCA and will be incorporated
into the appraisal criteria of school/community and municipal subprojects.
16. Institutional Assessment: (see Annex 9)
The level of existing institutional capacity is acceptable for project implementation. Nonetheless, technical assistance and
close supervision would further strengthen the existing capacity, especially during the initial phase of implementation. An
assessment of each of the executing institutions involved in the project and their roles is detailed in Annex 8.
a) Approach to Project Execution: The Antioquia Education Project differs from other Bank-financed operations in
Colombia as it will be implemented completely by a local government, a Departmento. The Departmento provides a closer
proximity, than the central government, to the municipalities and schools. Municipalities and schools will manage their
own project investments. Thus, the project would provide specific interventions to increase management capacity at the

municipal and school level, and will support the development of the new advisory and technical assistance functions of the
department.
b) Project management: The capacity of all executing agencies (see block 1, section 4) has been assessed. Existing staff
at the departmental level is qualified. Additional skills and competencies at the departmental, municipal, and school levels
either would be developed through training or contracted through additional staff or technical assistance. To decrease the
risk of central controls, fast, efficient, and effective procurement and disbursement mechanism were designed.
.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
17. Social Assessment:
Both the Local Government and the Bank assessed the social sustainability of the project. The process of consultation and
involvement of key stakeholders reflects a significant departure from previous World Bank experience of lending for
education in Colombia. A high participatory preparation and implementation add significantly to the project's social
viability. Two full reports, in the project files, describe the activities and results of the stakeholder analysis, the
participation plan, the assessment of the project's social impact, and the social risks. Social risks referring to the teacher's
union, competitive selection of municipalities (and nonselected ones), and weaker schools and communities are presented
below in section 21.

Assessment:                   Category
Under the existing menu of eligible school subprojects and municipal education investments, none poses an enviromnental
risk.
Additional school places will be provided mainly by expansion of existing schools; contracting of school places in private,
nonprofit schools; and tutorial programs which would make use of any existing school/community buildings. In rural
areas, some school construction may be needed; however, noninhabited sites are available and the risk of relocation is
unlikely. In urban areas, new school construction is minimum (the project targets mostly rural and semiurban
municipalities and excludes the Departmental capital, Medellin). Nevertheless, the criteria for approval of municipal
investment plans would include guidelines for land selection and appropriate compensation and relocation in the unlikely
case this is needed. It is also expected that specific school or municipal subprojects will contribute positively to school
environment (sanitation, protection and education programs, etc.).
Regarding indigenous populations, Antioquia does not have a specific native population. However, the demand-driven
project design, in addition to equity criteria included in financing of subprojects, will guarantee that poor, rural, or any
other disadvantaged groups will be empowered to decide and finance their own projects and most pertinent educational
needs.

20. Sustainability:
Sustainability would be ensured through participation, counterpart contributions, appraisal criteria, and evaluations.
Commitment of the community and the municipality: Sustainability would be ensured by the high degree of involvement of
the community, school, and municipality, through their participation in the process of identification, preparation,
appraisal, contracting and supervision of subprojects. Counterpart contributions from municipal investment budgets would
increase ownership on both the community and municipal levels. Assessment of the degree of actual participation in the
implementation of subprojects by the beneficiaries would take place at the community level, with a social analysis of this
involvement at the municipal level. The overall results of these projects, and, by extension the use of funds (veedurias),
would be evaluated by the community. Sustainability would thus be ensured by the commitment, both financial and
participatory, of the counterparts and by the resultant subprojects which will follow a competitive-based appraisal criteria
focused on both municipal and community commitment and socioeconomic need.
Recommendations of the community based assessment to ensure sustainability and results:
Project Activity: School/Community Subprojects.
a) High degree of municipal, school and community participation in subproject identification, preparation, appraisal,
contracting, and supervision;
b) Community based evaluation of the results of the subprojects and use of funds (veedurias); and
c) Process evaluations to assess the degree of actual participation by beneficiaries in project implementation.
Project Activity: Municipal Investment.
a) Use of fiscal sustainability criteria during the preparation, appraisal and implementation of subprojects.
b) High degree of participation of municipal level education stakeholders in subproject identification, preparation,
appraisal, contracting, and supervision;
c) Ownership by municipal government, as evidenced through counterpart contributions from their investment
budgets;
d) A competitive-based appraisal criteria which focus on both municipal and community commitment and
socioeconomic need;
e) Community based evaluation of the results of the subprojects and use of funds, and
f)  Carrying out of a social analysis to assess the degree of participation by the beneficiaries in the preparation, of the
proposed municipal subprojects.
Project Activity: Departmental Education Services.
a) High degree of participation of SEDUCA staff in the preparation and implementation of the project;
b) Considerable support of the project by the national and municipal level governments;
c) Implementation of an information, education and communication campaign design to encourage support for the
project and its objectives;
d) Institutional strengthening interventions focus both on structural/procedural improvements and in team building
and change management;
e) Community based evaluation of the results of the overall project through qualitative evaluations of beneficiary
satisfaction;

Teachers Union's criticism   High    Strong community support due to earlier successes of the coverage expansion
of expansion of schooling            with NGO participation will ameliorate negative consequences of Union's

nongovernmental education            coverage to occur in communities most in need, especially rural and isolated
institutions                         areas.
Teacher strike             Moderate Teacher strikes are common occurrences. The direct financing of subprojects
prepared by teachers and parents are expected to dissipate any teacher
resistance to the project and promote greater parental support for uninterrupted
school time.
Extreme social violence   Moderate Some communities in Antioquia are more prone to violence than others. This is

participation                        school and community subprojects may allow these communities to finance its
own educational strategies which motivate changes in attitude, promote
peaceful resolution of conflict, and improve interpersonal and communication
skills of children and youths.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
* Demand by Other Municipalities and Departments Which Can not be Met Directly by the World Bank. As pilot
operations, the Antioquia and Pasto Education Projects will raise expectations of support in other municipalities and
departments. The direct support by the World Bank in each municipality (about 1060 in total) and/or department (32
in all) is not be feasible, given economic and time-resource constraints. Thus, a second phase from this investment
aims at establishing a national system to assist other municipalities and departments in preparing quality project
proposals, which may be eligible to access multilateral development loans. The two projects serve as pilot operations,
which will provide ideas on ways to reduce overbureaucratization and enhance the efficiency of nationwide systems.
From the lessons learned in the pilots, the second phase of the national strategy would develop Colombia's own
internal mechanisms for project preparation, technical assistance, and channeling multilateral financing for other local
governments.
*  Indebtedness Capacity: In line with the promotion of local fiscal discipline, a key criterion included for selection of
the participating decentralized projects was financial indebtedness capacity. However, during the preparation period of
projects to be financed by multilateral Banks, departments and municipalities may seek other credits and loans in
private banks and financial markets. To reduce risk of a deteriorating financial status, the indebtedness study was
updated prior to national approval for the guarantee of the loan and prior to project appraisal. Additionally, the central
government requested a fiscal management plan to guarantee efficient use of revenues, lower operating costs, and/or
reduced access to additional debt.
*  Political Influence on Municipal and School-Community Operations: Under fiscal constraints, politicians may tend
to see local investment subprojects as an alternative tool to please their constituencies and influence investment-,. The
subproject procedures for allocation and use of resources are established in a very clear and transparent manner.
Additionally, the multilevel communication and ex post evaluation (Department, municipal, and school) would
provide check points to assess the adequacy, effectiveness, and transparency of investments and would guarantee
stakeholders' involvement.

Annex 2
Detailed Project Description
The project has 3 components: The School And Community Strengthening Component would finance the
development and implementation of school improvement plans (SIPs). The Municipal Education Management
and Investments Component would finance municipal education plans to improve education management;
increase education access; and provide municipal educational resources. The Departmental Education Services
Component will strengthen the technical assistance, sector evaluation and information/communication functions
of the Departmental Education Secretariat. These three components are detailed below.
Project Component 1 - School and Community Strengthening Subprojects: US$49 million (total cost of
component)
The project will provide financial transfers ( nonrefundable) for two kinds of subprojects: school improvement
subprojects and participatory management strengthening proposals. School Improvement subprojects are
intended to address objectives related to the school environment, pedagogical innovations, instructional
materials, equipment, and education technology. Participatory Management proposals aim at improving school-
based management and community/parental participation. In addition, the component will finance municipal
level teacher training and technical assistance.
In each of approximately 80 participating municipalities, the component will finance 15 school improvement
subprojects and 15 participatory management proposals (a total of 1200 schools/communities over the life of the
project). Municipalities would select approximately 75 percent of their schools from rural and very poor
communities.
School Improvement subprojects presented by School Boards (Consejos Directivos) are each expected to cost an
average of US$25,000 (larger under especial circumstances, but not exceeding US$50,000). The implementation
period is limited to three years or less (execution would be no more than two years plus one year of training,
capacity building and planning). Participatory management subprojects will include proposals to improve
teacher-community partnerships, school-related community programs, and parental support of schools. These
proposals will be prepared and presented by Parents Association and by school staff. Up to US$6,000 will be
provided per school: approximately US$3,000 for Parents Association proposals and US$3,000 for teachers'
proposals. The actual amounts will be based on an allocation formula, including per student and need criteria.

Project Component 2 - Municipal Education Management Strengthening and Investment Development:
US$20 million (total cost of component)
The project will finance investment proposals from up to 80 municipalities. The key objective of the component
is to improve education management while guiding municipal investments in the education sector. Municipal
investments supported by the component would increase school access and provide municipal education and
cultural services in each municipality (the type of education center is demand-driven and may be, for example, a
library, a teacher resource center, a children museum).
To build education planning, management and evaluation capacity, the component will finance the
modernization of the Municipal Secretariats of Education and Municipal Education Boards (JUME), including
infrastructure improvements, equipment, and technical assistance and training for management development
programs. Also, as an initial incentive for the selected municipalities, the component will finance refurbishment
and equipment for local education administration offices (Nzucleos Educativos).
Eighty out of 125 municipalities will participate in the project. Municipalities will be selected according to their
own socioeconomic level to guarantee representation of poor and isolated areas. Three socioeconomic levels will
be used, each based on socioeconomic and education rankings. Municipal proposals to participate in the project
will be presented to SEDUCA, at the departmental level, which will make a competitive selection based on
agreed weighted criteria. Although the project expects to intervene in 80 municipalities during its
implementation, participation will be gradual: 16-25 municipalities will participate during the first year, 32 more
during the second year, and the remaining will join during the third year of project implementation. Municipal
investments will have a duration of 2-3 years per municipality. Within each participating municipality, 15
schools/communities will also be selected to participate in the School and Community Strengthening
Component.
GENERAL SELECTION CRITERIA
Socioeconomic criteria: (i) municipalities with large rural or poor communities, (ii) regional
representation, and (iii) socioeconomic representation.
Organizational criteria: (i) political commitment and community participation; (ii) existing
educational bodies (or willingness to create them) established by the education law (such as
JUMEs, School Governments, Personeros Estudiantiles); and (iii) willingness to strengthen
evaluation of outputs and impact in the education sector.
Economic criteria: (i) financial sustainability, and (ii) prior investments in education.
Aggregated investments per municipality are expected to cost an average of US$300,000 (larger under special
circumstances, but not exceeding US$600,000). The implementation period is limited to three years or less
(execution would be no more than two years plus one year of training, capacity building and planning). Although
the mix of educational investments and management improvement interventions will be decided by
municipalities, the table below presents an approximation of a possible breakdown of the percentages and overall
component costs.

The School/Community and Municipal components include the following cycle: (i) promotion; (ii) organization and technical assistance; (iii) project
preparation, appraisal, and approval; (iv) implementation, supervision and monitoring; and (v) impact evaluation. At any stage, ongoing technical support
would be available to increase implementation capacity of municipalities, communities and schools.
Promotion       The Department will initiate the general project promotion, infornation and dissemination. Selected municipalities will implement their
own promotion and information campaigns. Schools and communities will inform and consult local stakeholders on their respective
subprojects.
Organization    As a result of the promotional activities, a number of municipalities and schools will send proposals to the Department, via the Municipality,
and Technical   to participate in the project. Selected municipalities will evaluate their own need for technical assistance and training and will have access to
Assistance (TA)  resources to improve their management capacity. Supervision offices (Jefes de Nuicleo) will be refurbished. Selected municipalities will
choose competitively 15 schools (preferably 12 rural and 3 urban) to participate in the School and Community Strengthening Component.
Selected schools and their communities will also receive support to strengthen their own organizational structure and human resources.
Subproject      Municipalities will prepare subproposals for funding of municipal investments and improve education management Schools will prepare
Preparation,    their own school improvement subprojects, as well as participatory management strengthening proposals by teachers and Parents
Appraisal and    Associations. Subproject appraisal and approvals will be coordinated by SEDUCA, for municipal investment, and by the Municipality, for
Approval        school investments. As possible, the appraisal process will be conducted locally, although coordinated by the responsible institutions. The
appraisal and selection process should take less than 2 weeks from submission. Notices of subprojects not approved will include stated
reasons and offer a list for additional technical assistance. Approved municipal subprojects are sent to SEDUCA who authorizes the signing
of a standard agreement for accountability in the use of funds between SEDUCA and the Municipality, and between the Municipality and its
selected schools. For financial and disbursement procedures see Annex 7.
Implementa-    Municipal education secretariats implement their investment plans and supervise and assist their schools. Likewise, school and communities
tion,           will implement their own subprojects. Daily monitoring is the responsibility of each executing level. Monitoring by a higher level of
Supervision and  govemment (e.g., department over municipalities, municipalities over schools, and schools over PTAs) will focus on subproject outputs and
Monitoring      performance and not on daily supervision of procedures and activities. The executive officers at each level (e.g., Secretary of Education,
School Principal, Head of the PTA) will be responsible for making sure that inputs are delivered, as planned, in terms of quantity, quality,
time, costs, and that resources were and used as intended. The subproject proposals (stating expected outputs) and the standard legal
agreements will serve as the key accountability instrument to measure actual versus expected outputs. The School Education Project (PEI),
the Annual Investment Plan (POA) and extemal and self-evaluations of results will provide the basis for assessing the effective
implementation of school investments and their impact.
Impact          At the end of each set of participating municipalities, SEDUCA will conduct an evaluation process to assess the appropriateness of the
Evaluation      components' design. Midterm impact evaluations will assess any early indicators of impact on behavior change and on the improvement of
the quality of teaching and leaming in the schools
Capacity        The Components will finance and arrange for the capacity building or training activities required by municipalities, schools and
Building        communities.
Coverage        Since 100% coverage of all 125 municipalities and their schools is not possible, the goal of the program is to assist approximately 80
municipalities representing the various regional and socioeconomic conditions of the department. In addition, by concentrating also in a
sample of schools (15 in each municipality), the project will better control the institutional leaming process and the quality of project
interventions. As such, it is expected the project would be a catalyst to improve education investments in the rest of schools and
muni ipalities of Antioqu.ia.

Project Component 3 - Strengthening of Departmental Education Services: US$11 million
(total cost of component)
This component would: (i) strengthen the capacity of SEDUCA to coordinate the project (see
organizational chart in next section); (ii) promote the consolidation of an efficient communication and
information systern across the department; (iii) strengthen SEDUCA's technical and advisory services to
its municipalities; (iv) implement a participatory plan and social marketing campaign in support of
educational reforms and promotion of positive values and attitudes toward education; (v) strengthen the
process and impact evaluation capacity of departmental and municipal education organizations; and (vi)
document and disseminate lessons learned in project preparation and implementation. Specific
institutional strengthening investments are detailed below.
Change Management Interventions. Technical assistance and training directed at SEDUCA would focus
in areas of organizational development, team-based management, interinstitutional partnership building,
consulting skills, conflict resolution and community participation. The resources will build on the
participatory approach used in project design involving various departments of SEDUCA and the
departmental secretariats for finance and planning. Technical training in strategic planning, financial
management, decentralized procurement and service delivery, and system evaluation will complement
the change management interventions.
Communication and Information System Across the Department. SEDUCA will finance the initial
infrastructure to improve communication across education agencies in the Department. At the central
level, SEDUCA will establish its own network for computer connections and electronic mail. With
selected municipal secretariats of education, SEDUCA will establish the required connectivity
equipment. In municipalities where computer technology is not the appropriate option, a simpler
technology will be used (e.g., phone and fax systems).
Development of Technical Information Services and Dissemination of Educational Innovations. As
part of its technical support, as opposed to direct management responsibilities (which are transferred to
the municipalities), SEDUCA will systematize new departmental educational services including: (i) the
design of technical guides in such areas as contracting with NGOs, education technology, school
construction, and financial sustainability; (ii) description and information on SEDUCA's consulting
services for municipalities in such areas as curriculum development, educational planning, monitoring
and evaluation; and (iii) a rationalization of SEDUCA's educational services vis-a-vis those offered most
competitively and efficiently by the private sector, NGOs, and universities.
Strategic Information, Education and Communication (IEC) Strategy. The project will finance project
promotional activities, community participation programs, a social marketing campaign, participatory
monitoring, and dissemination of project outcomes. Through the use of media (television, radio, and
newspapers) and strategic alliances with the private sector, and recognized celebrities (pro bono), the
social marketing program will promote positive attitudes towards education in Antioquia. The
component will also finance the information and consultation events designed as part of the project's
community participation objectives.
Research andAnalysis of Lessons Learned To disseminate lessons learned within the project, as pilot
for nationwide decentralization and education development programs, SEDUCA will coordinate studies
31



and ongoing research to on successful pedagogical innovations and community participation,
decentralized management and financial transfers, local innovations on curriculum development, teacher
and staff development programs, and process and impact evaluation lessons.
Impact and Process Evaluation System. The project will finance the design, systems, collection of data,
and analysis to evaluate project processes and education impact. This investment will provide the
foundation to establish a Department wide system to track processes, outputs and improvements in the
education sector.

Annex 4
ANTIOQUJIA: Basic Education Project
Economic Principles that Guide Project Design
JUSTIFICATION FOR PUBLIC INVESTMENT
The justification for public investments is guided by the following considerations (i) the social rates of
return to education; (ii) the public and private partnership; (iii) the impact on the poor; and (iv) the
effectiveness of inputs on learning outcomes.
Social Rates of Return to Education
Research consistently provides strong evidence that investments in all levels of education are profitable,
and that the rates of return to society are highest in primary education. In Colombia, the social rates of
return to primary education were about 20 percent, that to secondary education, about 11.4 percent, and
that to university education, about 14 percent. These rates of return are higher than the cost of capital,
thereby making investments in education justifiable on economic grounds. (See Table below on Latin
America for comparison.) Therefore, this project, which supports public investments in basic education,
would yield benefits to Colombian society.

Investments. World Bank.
The Public and Private Partnership
Given the significant role human capital plays in increasing productivity, and the market failures in the
demand of education, the government has an undeniable responsibility in the financing of education,
particularly at the basic level. Government financing, however, does not preclude private provision and
financing. In Antioquia, private sector participation is extensive. For example, between 1995 and 1997,
35



the Government of Antioquia financed 100,000 student places in high quality, nonprofit, private
institutions. The project supports the continuation of this partnership between the public and private
sectors. In urban areas in particular, where private providers are many, expanding school places and
improving quality should aim at fostering this partnership. In rural areas, particularly the remote part of
Antioquia, where private providers are few because there are not sufficient number of students to induce
them to operate, the government would have to assume the responsibilities of both the provision and
financing of education.
Impact on the Poor
Studies from international experiences suggest that investment in basic education (primary and lower
secondary) is likely to be more efficient and equitable than investment in higher education.2 The World
Bank Country Study, Poverty in Colombia (1994) confirmed that in 1992 the poorest 20 percent of
households received 39 percent of total subsidies, an amount 9 times that received by the richest 20
percent. At the secondary level, because the poorest quintile had low enrollment and resided mostly in
rural areas, the second and third quintiles benefited the most. Nevertheless, the first 3 quintiles benefited
more from public spending in secondary education than the last 2 quintiles. The situation is the reverse in
higher education, because enrollment in higher education is concentrated in the fourth and the fifth
quintiles. (See Table below.)

The overall distribution impact shows that public education expenditures benefit low income households
relatively more than other income groups mainly because of the poor's high participation rates in
primary and lower secondary education (See the following Table). In 1992, households in the poorest
quintile accounted for 23 percent of all subsidies. However, because the poor tends to have larger
families, the distribution of per capita subsidies is neutral. It is also evident that because enrollment
ratios at different levels of education differed by quintile, poor students benefited less at the higher level.

For the above mentioned reasons, the two decentralized projects in Pasto and Antioquia, Colombia, are
targeting poorer populations, as 90 percent of the poor attend public schools. Also, in Antioquia, the
Department is targeting its support to small, less affluent municipalities. Larger municipalities (over
100,000 inhabitants), such as Medellin, will manage their own education resources autonomously of the
Department.
Effectiveness of Educational Inputs
Guided by a wealtltof research, this project emphasizes investments in educational inputs that are known
to be effective in promoting student learning. These investments include: (i) provision of libraries,
textbooks, instructional materials and facilities; (ii) increasing the opportunity to learn through
increasing instructional time and homework; and (iii) provision of teacher training. The following graph
summarizes the percentage of studies showing differential positive effects of various educational
investments on student learning.

CRITERIA FOR PROJECT DESIGN
The criteria used to guide the choice among different project designs to achieve the development
objectives are as follows: least cost estimates; (ii) stakeholder consultations and participatory
decisionmaking; (iii) lessons learned from previous designs; (iv) study tours to countries with effective
decentralization reforms; and (v) institutional capacity. Here we present two major alternatives for which
the least cost estimate criteria was a decisive element (for other project design choices see Block 2,
section 8).
Least Cost Estimates
The least cost estimates will guide decisions on increasing the supply of school places and the methods
of building institutional capacity through training, The following paragraphs explain the methods:
School construction versus contracting with private providers. The least cost principle shall guide the
decision on whether additional school places shall be supplied by the government or by nongovernment
organizations. For example, the government has two options in meeting the demand for additional places
at the secondary level in the urban areas. The government opts to build and operate a public school, or
the government contracts with a nongovernment or private school to provide education to the same
number of students. The capital and operating costs can be drawn from a sample of public and private
schools with comparable inputs and learning outcomes. For the government schools, the capital costs
include land, construction costs, furniture and equipment; and recurrent costs include personnel, training,
textbooks and supplies, maintenance and repair, utilities and insurance. For the private schools, they tend
to rent buildings, rather than to construct schools on their own land. Therefore, the rental cost should be
38



added to the recurrent cost, while the capital cost would exclude land and construction and the other
recurrent costs remain the same. A comparison could be made as to which option is less costly after, say,
20 years of operating the school. The net present value of the per student cost between private and public
schools can be estimated and compared. The following table provides the preliminary findings of a
simulation, wherein private provision might be the slightly less expensive choice:

The project design opted to combine both educational expansion approaches. Contracts with NGOs
would be the preferred option in urban areas where construction of public schools is more expensive and
supply of private provider, is greater. In rural and isolated municipalities, construction of public schools
is recommended because of the shortage of private providers.
Institutional Capacity Building: Centrally provided training and technical assistance versus block
transfers to enable beneficiaries to choose training and assistance providers. A key development
objective of the project, proposed and agreed upon by a large representation of education stakeholders in
Antioquia, is to "improve the capacity of schools/communities, municipalities and the department to
provide effectively their own respective education services." During project preparation, various
alternatives were tested to select the most appropriate and cost-effective design to achieve the stated
objective. Improving management capacity implied both skill development and behavioral changes at all
institutional levels: (i) school/community, (ii) municipality and (iii) department.
The first proposed project design included a large training program, centrally managed, to develop skills
in participatory management, planning, administration, pedagogical decentralization, and restructuring.
To complement the training program, officials and technical experts from the Departmental Secretariat
of Education (SEDUCA), would provide direct technical assistance in site. The original rationale for this
design was (i) to have direct control in the design of training to ensure delivery and quality, and (ii) to
use existing technical and human resources in SEDUCA.
A second alternative was to provide schools and municipalities with block transfers earmarked for key
actors and specifically for capacity building . These included transfers for pedagogical improvements,
management and organizational development, and community involvement. The transfers would be
complemented with a quality review of private sector service providers (for both training and technical
39



assistance) and an ex post evaluation of results on the ground. In addition, skill development,
accomplished by training interventions, would be complemented with increased decisionmaking at the
local level and responsibility for managing of funds, which in itself can promote changes in management
behaviors from passive recipients of inputs to active change agents.
Although both approaches could have been effective in developing skills (though the second one
included an increased participatory and empowerment component), a comparison of costs of both
initiatives shows that block financial transfers provide the least cost. The summary table below compares
the costs between centrally provided training and block transfers, in terms of the net present value (NPV)
of the total cost, and cost per municipio, and cost per teacher.

ANTIOQUIA: Basic Education Project
Financial Summary
Review of Public Expenditure on Education in Antioquia During Fiscal
Decentralization and Fiscal Sustainability of the Project
Review of Public Expenditure on Education in Antioquia
The fiscal sustainability of the project is closely linked to the fiscal decentralization process that
has accompanied political decentralization and reform. This process began with the
establishment of the electoral system for local officials and members of Congress (Law 11 of
1986) and of the legal framework for fiscal transfer from the central level to the municipalities
(Law 12 of 1986), paving the way for the election of mayors since 1988, and of governors since
1991. The landmark 1991 Constitution affirms the decentralized structure by distributing
administrative functions at different levels of government and increasing local responsibility in
the delivery of social services. The Constitution also allows department and municipal
governments to raise tax and nontax revenues, as well as to borrow to finance their investments.
The FIS was formed in 1992 to enable the central and municipal governments to cofinance
investments in the social sector through a line of credit. Law 60 of 1993 and Law 115 of 1994
spelled out in more specific terms the responsibilities of the departmental government to
formulate social policies and the municipalities to provide services, as well as the details of
fiscal transfer to empower these provincial and local governments.
The new system is predicated on the estimate that the central government would draw about 30
percent of its revenue from income taxes, 30 percent from value-added taxes, 30 percent from
customs and import taxes, and 10 percent from royalties and others. About 24.5 percent of the
central government's revenue are earmarked for "Situado Fiscal", which will be transferred to
departmental governments to cover the salaries of service personnel in education (75 percent)
and health (25 percent). Another 18 percent of the central government's revenue, known as
National Investment Transfer (Ingresos Corrientes de la Naci6n or ICN), are earmarked for
transfer to the municipalities. The municipalities are expected to spend about 27 percent of the
ICN on recurrent expenditures and 73 percent on investment, of which 30 percent are earmarked
for education. (See diagram, next page).
Fiscal decentralization, in summary, enables department governments to draw from three sources
of revenues: (i) their own taxes (mostly through levies on liquor and tobacco); (ii) their own
borrowing within the limits set by the central government; and (iii) Situado Fiscal which is
transferred from the central government to pay for salaries. Municipalities also have three
sources of revenue: (i) their own local taxes; (ii) FIS; and (iii) ICN, which constitutes the largest
41



source of social spending. Even when in the future, the FIS is to be integrated with other funds as
a result of rationalization of expenditure, the municipalities still have the ICN with which to
invest in education. The counterpart funds from municipalities for the project are to come from
the ICN transfer.
A review of public expenditures on education in Antioquia during the fiscal decentralization
process from 1991 to 1995 found that, in real terms, Situado Fiscal increased by 24 percent, FIS
by 94 percent, and municipal spending on education (through ICN transfer ) by 159 percent.
When municipal education spending is broken down by type of expenditure, recurrent
expenditure grew by 21 percent, while investment by 3.15 percent. Department recurrent
expenditures on education was reduced by 11 percent in large part due to rationalization of the
Antioquia government, but departmental investment in education grew by 98 percent. In total,
public expenditure on education grew by 41 percent in real terms between 1991 and 1995. As
public spending increased more rapidly than the growth of enrollment, per student spending rose
by 32 percent in real terms. (See the following table.)
Because the increase of education expenditures in the municipalities was greater than that of
Situado Fiscal or departmental expenditure, the relative proportion of these sources have shifted
during the period. The share of Situado Fiscal fell from 60 percent of total in 1991 to 53 percent
in 1995, and departmental expenditures on education also dropped from 21 percent to 15 percent,
while municipal expenditures increased from 15 percent to 28 percent of total. These trends show
that the municipalities have the fiscal capacity to invest in education in the project.

Fiscal Impact and Sustainability
Total project costs are US$83.3 million, including US$3.3 million in incremental recurrent costs over a
5-year period (or an average of US$0.66 million/year). The project costs are divided between
departmental investments and municipal investments; the latter includes transfers transfer to schools. A
yearly average of capital investment counterpart funds during the life of the project amount to
approximately US$1.3 million for the departmental government and approximately US$6.87 million for
the municipalities (approximately 80).
The estimated financial impact of the project was calculated based on the following assumptions: For the
Department, (i) the real departmental GDP growth rate was 5 percent in 1996 and it was estirfiated to
remain at 4 percent growth rate during the life of the project, from 1998 to 2002; (ii) the share of the
education budget was estimated to remain at about 2.2 percent of GDP over the 1998-2002 period; (iii)
real increments to the education budget would be used to finance improvements in basic education
(preschool, primary and lower secondary), while public expenditure on higher levels of education,
including transfers to universities would be kept in constant terms. For the Municipalities, (i) ICN which
increased by 6 percent in 1996, would remain at 4 percent growth rate during the life of the project; (ii)
the share of ICN used in the education sector would remain at its mandatory minimum: 30 percent; and
(iii) real increments to the education ICN would be used to finance school access and school-based
quality development in Basic Education.
At the departmental level, over the life of the project, real incremental recurrent costs are estimated to
grow from US$0.2 million in the first project year, to US$0.5 million in the last year. Based on projected
education budget increases of 4 percent per year, project recurrent costs as a percentage of education
expenditures would be small, ranging from 1.5 to 5.5 percent. Recurrent costs plus counterpart funds
would decline from US$1.929 million in the first project year to US$0.40 million in the last year. These
total costs as percent of education expenditure would decline from 5.55 percent in 1997 to 1.7 percent in
2000 and 0.12 percent in 2001. 60 percent of the total departmental recurrent costs plus counterpart funds
would be covered by only the aggregate budget increase during the 1997-2002 period (see Table 1
below).
At the municipal level, over the life of the project, real incremental recurrent costs are estimated to grow
from US$0.16 million in the first project year, to US$0.8 million in the last year. Based on projected ICN
increases of 4 percent per year, project recurrent costs as a percentage of the projected increases in ICN
would decrease from 47 percent in 1998 to 40 percent in 2002. Recurrent costs plus counterpart funds
would grow from US$2.17 million in 1998 to US$4.35 million in the last year, or 24 percent of the ICN
for the education sector in 1998 and 8.4 in 2002. After project completion, the yearly average
incremental recurrent costs at the municipal level generated by the project are estimated to be US$0.8
million, which would account for about 1.5 percent of the annual ICN allocated to the education sector
(see Table 2 below). In summary, it is estimated that the project is fiscally sustainable.
3This is a conservative average; the IMF and the Bank estimate that Colombia economy would grow between 5-6%
by the end of the decade, and Antioquia has maintained higher growth rates than the national averages.

Annex 6
ANTIOQUIA: Basic Education Project
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement Arrangements
General. Goods and works shall be procured in accordance with the provisions of Section I of the "Guidelines for Procurement
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996 (The
Guidelines) and the provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement.
School Grants. Given the small size of contracts and the wide range and timing of individual school and community
subprojects, packaging of works and items into large procurements groups is not feasible. The average cost of each individual
subproject is US$25,000 and will not exceed US$50,000. Thus, most contracts for minor works and goods would be awarded on
the basis of lump sum, fixed price contracts through quotations obtained from at least three eligible suppliers. Consequently, the
value of contracts for such projects will not be taken into account when calculating the aggregate limits mentioned in the
following paragraphs. Participating schools will follow procurement procedures for small purchases detailed in the Procurement
Manual which is satisfactory to the Bank. The Manual also details supervision, reporting and auditing requirements to ensure
the intended use of resources. The Bank will carry out procurement audits once a year to assure that procedures are consistent
with the Manual.
Civil Works. Works estimated to cost US$1.0 million or less but more than US$250,000 equivalent, will be awarded following
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$2.3 million. International
bidders will not be discriminated and the procedure should be acceptable to the Bank. Smaller works estimated to cost
US$250,000 or less equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$4.1 equivalent will be procured under
lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from at least three qualified contractors according
to guidelines detailed in the Procurement Manual.
Goods. Computers and communication equipment estimated to cost over US$250,000, would be procured using Limited
International Bidding (LIB), up to an aggregate amount of US$4.1 million. All other goods estimated to cost US$250,000 or
more would be procured using International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Goods estimated to cost less than US$250,000 but not
less than US$50,000 would be procured in accordance with the NCB procedures up to an aggregate amount of US$1.2 million.
For smaller purchases, National Shopping procedures may be used up to an aggregate amount of US$1.0 million for contracts
valued at less than US$50,000.
Employment of Consultants: Consultants' services shall be procured in accordance with the provisions of the "Guidelines:
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" published by the bank in January 1997 and the
provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement.
Consultants' Services with firms will be contracted through Quality-Cost Based Selection (QCBS) except as indicated below.
The short-list of consultants for these services, estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent per contract, may comprise
entirely of national consultants Consultants' services provided by firm's for technical assistance, training and other services of
standard or routine nature estimated to cost less than US$100,000 may be selected based on Least-Cost Selection procedures,
up to an aggregate amount of US$8.7. Provision of services by Educational NGOs for special access and rural education
programs, up to an aggregate amount of US$5.7 million will be contracted under Fixed Budget procedures. All other
consulting services estimated to amount in the aggregate of US$6.5 million will be procured under contracts awarded to
individual consultants in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 5.1 through 5.3 of the Guidelines: Selection and
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, dated January 1997.
Prior Review. Prior Bank review would be required before all bidding procedures for the following procurement actions: (a)
LIB and ICB procurement; (b) the first NCB procurement each year for both civil works and goods; (c) all consultants' services
estimated to cost US$100,000 or more if provided by a firm including those contracted under QCBS irrespective of thctir value,
47



according to the stipulations of Appendix 1 of the Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers, dated January 1997; and all consultants' services estimated to cost US$50,000 or more if provided by an individual;
(d) any amendment of contracts resulting in the increase of the contract value beyond the review limits set in (a) through (c)
above; and (e) all TOR. Random ex post review of all other contracts will be carried out by Bank supervision missions.
A Procurement Plan satisfactory to the Bank, including sample LOIs and TORs for the first year of implementation was
elaborated prior to project negotiations. A project launch workshop to familiarize the project coordination personnel with
procurement, disbursement, reporting and auditing requirements will be organized at an early stage in Project implementation.
The General Publication Notice will be published together with the first invitation to express interest to consultant contracts.

Annex 7
ANTIOQUIA: Basic Education Project
Financial Management Arrangements
A Financial, Management, Reporting and Auditing manual (FMM) describing in details the financial management
requirements for each level of implementation of the project was prepared by the SEDUCA and was discussed and agreed upon
during project appraisal. A first draft was placed in the project files.
Financial Reporting. Since most aggregated documentation both in the case of the Municipal Investments ard School
Subprojects will eventually be sent to the Departmental Secretariat of Education (SEDUCA, see below), overall project
financial reporting and auditing will be the ultimate responsibility of this agency. The project would be required to prepare
financial statements, which would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit report would
be submitted to the Bank for review and approval within six months of the end of each fiscal year.
Special Account. In order to facilitate disbursements, a Special Account in the amount of US$3 million will be established in
$US in a commercial bank which is outside of Colombia but has branches in Medellin, Antioquia. This arrangement is currently
in place on other Bank projects in Colombia, in which Special Accounts are held in U.S. branches of Colombian banks. The
rationale for this procedure is that the country's central bank is not equipped to handle a large volume of small transactions and
does not offer all required banking services (see Figure #1 of this annex).
Monitoring of the SA, including the preparation of withdrawal applications for reimbursement from the Loan Account, will be
the responsibility of SEDUCA's Technical, Administrative and Financial Directorate (Direcci6n Financiera FER). However,
for internal control purposes and in order to operate within the existing financial management system, Secretaria de Hacienda
(Hacienda), the Finance Secretariat, will manage the account under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The Bank
would make an initial deposit of US$lmillion in the Special Account. Once total withdrawals from the account have reached
US$3 million, the authorized allocation for the Special Account would be increased to US$3 million. SEDUCA V'Il submit
replenishment applications for the Special Account on a monthly basis, or when 25 percent of the authorized allocation has
been used, whichever occurs first. Thie- replenishment applications will be supported by the necessary documentation: a bank
statement of the Special Account and a reconciliation of the Special Account against the Bank's records. Replenishment of the
Special Account would follow Bank procedures. The Special Account would be audited in conjunction with the annu, I audit of
the project (see above).
Counterpart Funds
A. Departmental level -- Activities to be financed under the Department Education Services Strengthening Component
(see Figure #2 of this annex):
A Current Account (CA) in Pesos would be established for counterpart funds, possibly in the same local branch of the
commercial bank where the SA will be open. Through these funds the Department will cofinance all the various activities of the
project according to the disbursement categories described in Table C. As with the SA, the establishment of the CA would
necessitate an initial deposit by the Department, equivalent to 4-6 months of the Department's share of expected project
expenditures. The account would be periodically reimbursed by Hacienda after submission by SEDUCA of an application for
reimbursement -- with financial reports as agreed to between the SEDUCA and Hacienda
This system will provide assurance that counterpart funds will be readily available for project expenditures. In addition,
accounting for expenditures which are financed by both parties (i.e. the Bank and the Department) will be transparent, since
each account will only be used to pay for that financier's portion of the expenditure.
B. Municipal level: The selected municipalities will provide the counterpart funds to finance the Municipal and School
investment subprojects. To this end they will open a Municipal CA similarly to what is described for the Departmenta' level.
Flow of Funds to Municipal Investments and Subprojects. A written contract (SEDUCA Agreement) between the
Department and the Municipality will regulate the transfer and the use of funds to finance the municipal investments and school
subprojects.
51



A. Municipal Investments (see Figure #3 of this annex): Municipalities will be eligible to make an advanced payment of up
to 20 percent on signed contracts of goods, services and civil works. This initial advance will be financed by both loan and
counterpart funds; the loan portion will be deposited only after the municipality has entered into a written contract with the
Department and after the relative amount of counterpart financing has been deposited by the municipality.
After the transfer of the downpayment, subsequent transfers of funds to municipalities will be made only after the SEDUCA is
satisfied as to the use of funds previously transferred. The municipalities will have to submit a financial report to the SEDUCA,
with all expenditures fully supported by appropriate documentation. Then, SEDUCA, through Hacienda, will make available to
the Municipalities a reimbursement equivalent to the Bank financing share for each category described in Table C. The project
will provide each municipality with a standard, concise chart of accounts, which will represent a subset of the overall project
account structure, and appropriate accounting software. Training on the use of this accounting system will be provided by the
SEDUCA to each of the municipalities.
B. School Subprojects (see Figure #4 of this annex): To finance the subprojects developed by each of the selected schools of
the participating Municipalities, the project will periodically transfer funds to each institution through a current account which
will form part of the Fondos Servicios Docentes (school managed accounts established by Law 60) (FSD) according to the
procedures detailed in the Operational Manual. (Schools without resources to manage their budget and accounting procedures
can request to have payments made on their behalf by their local Education Secretariat.)
Upon signing the school agreements, the project will transfer funds equivalent to four to six months of implementation of the
subprojects. The Bank loan will finance these activities in block transfers. Direccion Financiera FER will deposit the transfers
into the FSD for each school upon request from-the-respective Municipality and only after the amount of municipal counterpart
financing is deposited in the FSD. The schools, represented by their Principal, will have to submit a financial report to the
Municipality, with all expenditures fully supported by appropriate documentation. The project will provide each school with a
simple format to track inflow/outflow of funds and a statement of expenditures. Training on simple accounting procedlures will
be provided to schools opting to self-manage their own transfers.
Each Municipality will transfer the appropriate documentation relative to the implementation of school subpiojects to
SEDUCA. A new tranche of school subproject financing for an additional period of four to six months will be transferred by
SEDUCA, through Hacienda, upon request from the Municipality only after satisfactory review of the use of funds during the
previous period and the municipal financing share for the following period be deposited into the FSD. School subprojects will
be part of annual audits and the Bank, during regular supervision missions, will also review a randomly selected sample of
school subprojects.

Antioquia: Basic Education Project
Description of Impact and Process Evaluation TORs
Purpose
To ensure that the project has achieved its objectives at the school and municipal levels and that
education stakeholders have a say in assessing project processes, strategies and use of resources
during the implementation of the project.
Impact Evaluation Goals
* To measure the level of improved student learning at time of graduation, which would have
occurred during the implementation of the Antioquia Education Project.
* To measure the level of access to schooling and changes in education efficiency (student
dropout and repetition), which would have occurred during the implementation of the
project.
* To measure the level of perceived improvements in student attitude and interpersonal skills
which would have occurred during the implementation of the project.
- To measure changes (type, time and perceived satisfaction) of relations among municipal
officials, principals, teachers, student, parents and the community.
Process Evaluation Goals
- To evaluate the processes, of provision of the respective educational services between the
department, municipalities and the schools as regards to equity, timeliness and satisfaction.
- To assess the effectiveness and efficiency of project implementation procedures and
organizational functions. in order to make timely adjustments.

Evaluation Design
1.    The impact evaluation design will focus on three levels of impact: (i) overall student learning, (ii) improved
access and education efficiency, and (iii) behavior and institutional changes at the school, municipal and departmental
level. The process evaluation will assess the efficiency and effectiveness of delivery of services among the different
institutional levels, but especially to the school. The project interventions will be provided to a total of 80
municipalities and up to 15 schools in each of the 80 municipalities, for a total of 1,200 schools.
2.    No random experimental and control groups were selected. Instead, the evaluation is concerned only in
specifying if any significant changes took place in the 1,200 schools during the implementation of the project by
comparing the status of the three abovementioned levels of impact, prior and after project implementation.
Antioquia's Secretariat of Education decided on a black box evaluation approach (i.e., no attempt will be made to
desegregate the impact of the project from other educational interventions). The evaluation will not assure full direct
causality but will assess the overall status prior to implementation and the changes perceived after project
interventions.

3.    The process evaluation will assess the efficiency and effectiveness of project implementation procedures and
other organizational and managerial elements of the project. The first evaluation of project processes and procedures
will take place after the initial phase of project implementation, consisting of only 16 municipalities. After the initial
phase and any adjustments resulting from the first process evaluation results, the project will be expanded gradually to
an additional 64 municipalities.
Outcome Measures
4.    For each of the evaluation goals, the following objectives and measures are defined:
5.    Measure Improved Student Learning. The objective is to differentiate the level of student learning in four
basic curriculum subjects: language arts, mathematics, science and social studies. The learning measures would be the
average SABER scores per school. SABER is a standardized series of tests administered to third and sixth graders, at
the end of the school year.
56



6.    Measure Level of School Openness Toward the Community and Community Contributions to Schools.
A community and school survey will try to determine what is the level of satisfaction/attitudes of principals, teachers
and parents towards community involvement in school, and how satisfaction and attitude change over time. A second
indicator of comnnunity participation will be the level of community contributions (time, in-kind, financial) compared
between the beginning and the end of the project. It is expected that children will benefit from parental involvement in
the school (e.g., more homework emphasis, communication between parents and teachers); thus, it is expected those
schools that implement community involvement plans will show higher SABER scores.
7.    Measure the difference in access to education resources in participating Municipalities: The process
evaluation indicators will track (i) the procedures used to deliver education inputs (e.g., civil works, instructional
materials, training), (ii) the level of resources channeled directly to schools, and (iii) the respective outputs produced
(e.g., increased access, infrastructure improvements, instructional materials available, number of staff trained).
Data Collection Procedures.
8. Five tools for data collection will be used: (i) existing standardized test scores, SABER; (ii) a school survey
designed to collect demographic information of each school, but also include questions designed to assess attitudes
and behaviors at the school level; (iii) investment data from miunicipal education secretariats; (iv) yearly focus groups
with school staff, students and community representatives to triangulate the result of the surveys; (v) and random
school climate observations.
Data Analysis.
9. Selection, application and reporting of inferential statistics will be used for analysis of evaluation data. Case studies
of project implementation experiences will analyze further qualitative impact.

Annex 9
Antioquia: Basic Education Project
Institutional Assessment Summary
Approach to Project Execution: The Antioquia Education Project differs from other Bank-financed operations in Colombia
as it will be implemented completely by a local government, a Departmento. The Departmento provides a closer proximity,
than the central government, to the municipalities and schools. Municipalities and schools will manage their own project
investments. Thus, the project would provide specific interventions to increase management capacity at the municipal and
school level, and will support the development of the new advisory and technical assistance functions of the department. To
decrease the risk of central controls, fast, efficient and effective, procurement and disbursement procedures will support full
decisionmaking at the municipal and school levels. An assessment per each institutions follows:
The SchooL The new Colombian Education Policy (Law 115) confer increased education management responsibilities to
schools. Schools may design their own technical/pedagogical strategies and manage financial resources and investments in
school improvements. Schools may establish and manage their own financial accounts (Fondos de Servicios Docentes). The
Departmento of Antioquia developed an institutional strengthening plan to support its school's new role. It will also strengthen
institutional leaders (school principals, staff and teachers) and will encourage the participation of school parents in all aspects
regarding investment planning, financial management, as well as community monitoring and supervision.
The Community: Over the years, Antioquia has promoted community participation. For example, in the successful project
"Quiero a mi Colegio" ("I Love My School"), community-managed initiatives included school infrastructure improvements,
school safety, and community events to raise school funds. Such direct involvement guaranteed community ownership of
education services and greater civilian oversight of education investments. Undoubtedly, one of the characteristics of the
"Antioquefio" culture and idiosyncrasy is their motivation and capacity to mobilize community resources.
Nongovernmental Organizations: Under the present administration, a key policy was to reduce the size of the state and to
become partners with the civil society. The state government has promoted NGO participation as partners in implementing
public investments, especially those with social development objectives. Presently, there is a need to guarantee the colriinued
supply and quality of NGO services, especially for the least developed municipalities.
The Municipal Government: The 125 municipalities of Antioquia are diverse and at are at different stages of development. The
project's technical assistance strategy would guarantee that the municipalities indeed become responsible for the management
of education. Given the difference in financial resources, a continuous analysis of the financial capacities of participating
municipalities would guarantee fiscal sustainability. Municipalities' organizational structure are appropriate to assume the
management of the education sector: 60 percent of municipalities have JUMEs, and the percentage of national transfers
assigned to education (ICN) fluctuates between 20 percent and 45 percent (the mandated average is 30 percent).
The Departmental Government: The Department of Antioquia has demonstrated high political will to design, finance and
coordinate project activities; it also is strengthening its human resources, emphasizing flexibility, decentralization, autonomy
and participation. Its organizational structure is appropriate and its staff is qualified. The Secretariat of Education has four
specific duties: (i) long-term planning of the educational sector; (ii) supporting organization and educational processes; (iii) and
evaluating educational sector outputs. One remarkable weakness is still noted: the sector's evaluation and information systems
do not allow for a timely and appropriate decisionmaking process. The project will support in developing an evaluation culture,
capacity and required system and tools.
The National Government. The central government (including DNP, The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Education)
has supported all along the provision of direct multilateral development loans in light of the decentralization policies and local
management and decisionmaking. It expects the nationwide credibility and capacity of the Departmento de Antioquia would
promote greater national commitments to local autonomy and would further define the support required from the national level.
During project implementation, coordination between the center and the Departmento de Antioquia will guarantee mutual
learning and support/adoption
