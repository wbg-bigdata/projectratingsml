REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF ME PRESIDENT
1'O THE ElXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL FOR A RIVER POLDERS PROJECT
1.        I su-bmit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
c-edit to the Republic of Senegal for the equivalent of US$4.5 million on
standard IDA terms to help finance a River Polders Project.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        A report on the current economic position and prospects of Senegal
was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 10, 1970 (Report A'-15a).
A Bank economic mission visited Senegal in March to assess the current economic
situation and prospects. The following paragraphs reflect the findings of that
mission. Country data are given in Annex I.
Economic Potential
3.        Endowed with few natural resources, Senegal has only limited possi-
bilities for economic development. Ecological conditions are generally poor
(paragraph 21), particularly in the northern groundnut basin where the bulk
of the population lives.  The south and southeast offer better prospects for
developmaent of a variety of other agricultural products, but Senegal can still
be called a one crop economy, as groundnuts account for the cash income of
most of the rural population and for nearly half the country's export earnings.
4.        Apart from agriculture, the main possibilities for economic develop-
ment are fisheries, tourism and manufacturing. Thanks to rich resources off
the coast, fish production has been growing rapidly. International tourism
to Senegal has started to develop only in recent years, but prospects for
further expansion of this sector are promising. Senegal developed its
-ndustrial sectors earlier than other West African countries and its
industrial labor force is one of the best in Africa. However, although
there are certain definite possibilities for development of new crops and
new sectors, diversification will take a long time. The economy will for
some time continue to be affected by the vagaries of the weather and by
fluctuations in the world market price of groundnuts.
Past Development
5.        During the early 1960's, Senegal's economy remained stagnant.
The growth of GDP in real terms was minimal (1 percent a year) and per
capita income may have declined though at about US$250 is higher than in most
other African countries. Two factors were primarily responsible for this



- 2 -
slow growth.  First, independence caused Senegal to lose its pr.vileged posi-
tion as the center of French West Africa. This resulted in the loss of
export markets for manufactures as domestic industries developed in other
West African countries. At the same time, departure of most of the Frenc.
civilian and military personnel resulted in declining demand for serv%c_s
and locally produced goods.   Second, the Government was slow in aztac.Uing
the country's difficult adjustment problems.   The heavy administrativ.?
apparatus  inherited from colonial times could not respond quickly to t.-
new situation and government policies stressed administration rather than
development.  The First Development Plan (1961-64) concentrated oa investn;,    -
for social and transport infrastructure, including housing, urban water s
ply and administrative buildings; investments in rural sectors accoua d
for less than 20 percent of total development outlays.
6.        The second half of the 1960's saw more energetic development
policies by the Government.   There was a considerable increase -n the pub-ic
investment program, made possible by substantial improvements in absorp.ivc
capacity of the public sector.   The program became more directly deve1o;me.-
oriented with the share of investments in productive sectors increasing to
45 percent during the Second P:Lan. Rural investments improved in quality,
and tripled between the First and the Third Plan. Rural diversification,
mainly for cotton, rice and tomatoes, was successfully started.
7.        The change in the Government's development policy, however, came
too late to have a significant impact on tne economy in the late 1960's,
when a combination of bad weather and falling export prices led to a 50
percent decline of groundnut production, and when even production of millet
and other major food crops remained insufficient to cover local demand. In
the modern sector, however, the Government did succeed in stimulating import
substitution, and this partly coffset the loss of export markets. In an
otherwise static economy, annual growth of manufacturing output amounted to
6 to 7 percent.
8.        A number of factors combined to bring about a sizable growth of
GDP in the last four years after about seven years of virtual stagnation.
Between 1968 and 1971, GDP increased by over 8 percent a year (at current
prices). First, the Government's agricultural diversification efforts
started yielding important benefits. In addition, at the beginning of 1971,
effective measures were taken to stimulate groundnut output. Sharp in-
creases in world market prices after 1968 uade possible a 25 percent increase
in producer prices, and this, combined with favorable weather conditions,
nelped restore the level of groundnut production.    Finally, the modern secto.
of che economy continued to expand.   There was a marked increase in exports
of manufactured products, averaging 14 nercent a year and reflecting Senegal's
;mproving competitive position. At independence, the country had been
plagued with a high cost structure which seriously hampered economic growth.
Since then, however, Government policies have been aimed at curtailing price
and salary increases, which in turn allowed local industries (e.g., manufac-
turing of textiles and shoes) to start competing successfully in export markezs.



- 3-
Public Finance and Foreign Aid
9.        The public finances reflect these overall trends.    There was a
deterioration throughout most of the 1960's. By 1968/69, public savings
had declined slowly but continuously to virtually zero. Revenues stag-
nazed because of the decline in imports, the most important element of
the tax base. Thus, keeping the tax ratio at roughly 20 percent of GDP
was quite an achievement. But current expenditures grew, albeit moderately,
at some 3 to 4 percent annually thus eroding the current account surplus.
10.       After 1968/69, a recovery of public savings was made possible
because of better tax collection, increased tax rates and substantial sur-
pluses of the groundnut stabilization fund following the rise in groundnut
export prices. In 1970/71, public savings represented some 7 percent of cur-
rent revenues. Yet locally-financed public investment continued to exceed
savings by a wide margin, as it had throughout the 1960's, and this resulted
in a steady decline in Treasury deposits.
11.       Senegal has been benefiting from a large inflow of foreign aid,
mostly on concessionary terms. Between 1966 and 1970, foreign aid financed
about 65 percent of the public capital program and averaged US$30 million
per year. This corresponds to US$8.0 per capita annually, mainly financed
by the European Economic Community (40 percent) and France (30 percent).
The World Bank Group and Germany contributed, respectively, 13 and 10 per-
cent of the total. Foreign aid programs concentrated on infrastructure and
on directly productive projects in the rural sector. Of importance also was
the technical assistance, mainly in education, which amounted to US$29 mil-
lion annually, and which was mostly financed by the French Government.
Prospects
12.       In coming years the economy will probably grow faster than in the
past decade, largely as a result of on-going efforts to diversify agricul-
tural output and to expand fisheries, tourism and industrial exports. Medium
term prospects would be more favorable, were it not for the fact that ground-
nut prices are expected to fall from their present level of over E100/long
ton to t80/long ton by 1975.
13.       In view of the prospective fall in groundnut prices which is ex-
pected to erase the surplus of the stabilization fund within two or three
years, some acceleration of economic growth will be essential to help improve
the public finances. The government is determined to keep the expansion of
current expenditures to a minimum and to improve the financial performance
of public enterprises. However, since tax rates are already relatively high,
the urgently needed revenue increases will have to come from a combination
of better collection and overall economic growth.



-4 -
14.       Considering the need to diversify the economy, it appears essential
that public investment be increased from US$60 million annually during the
Third Plan (1969/73) to US$80 million durir.g the Fourth Plan.    However, wnile
such a program is in line with the recent improvement in the government s
capacity to prepare and implement projects, the slow increase in public
savings, together with the limited possibilities of deficit financing wit'.-
out endangering the difficult foreign exchange situation or restrictria-.
credit to the private sector, rake financing of the Fourth Plan difficult.
To offset the expected shortfall in local resources associated with the
deterioration of terms of trade, foreign lenders will have to increase
their share in the financing of the Fourth Plan to about 85 percent of
total development expenditures.    Foreign ald is expected to continue to
expand rapidly, based on the prograLs of the European Communities (Thirc
FED Program), bilateral aid donors (Canada, Italy, Belgium, and o--l produc-
ing countries in the Arab world) and the World Bank Group.     In view of Senegal
improved economic performance and absorptive capacity, increased external
assistance is warranted.
15.       External aid will have to continue to be on relatively soft terms
if it is not to create serious debt service problems. The proportion of
grant aid has declined from 85 percent in 1964-66 to 55 percent in 1969-71
and is likely to drop to about 40 percent of total foreign financial aid
during the period of the Fourth Plan. Although the foreign debt service
ratio is still low at 3-4 percent, financing of the remainder of foreign
aid on conventional terms would soon lead to unmanageable balance of pay-
ments and budgetary difficulties. Projections indicate that at least half
of non-grant aid should be extended on concessionary terms if an excessive
increase in the debt service ratio is to be avoided. Budget constraints
are even more serious, as debt service charges are already projected to
absorb one-half of gross public savings by 1980. Any substantial harden-
ing of the blend could result in negative public savings.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
16.       The Bank Group has had eleven operations in Senegal to date.      Total
lending amounts to US$56.0 million (net of cancellations), including seven
IDA credits, three Bank loans and one blend of Bank and IDA funds.      The Bank
Group is now Senegal's third largest aid donor (after France and the European
Economic Communities) providing about 13 percent of Senegal's external capi-
zal assistance. IFC has invested US$3.25 million in two projects in Senegal.
Annex IIcontains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC in-
vestments as of October 31, 197:2, and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
17.       Initially Bank Group lending in Senegal was limited to the trans-
port and groundnut sectors. A railway project financed in 1966 (Credit 96-
SE) was delayed and there were shortfalls in the railway's financial per-
formance.  However, the project eventually succeeded in strengthening the



railway authority which, with the assistance of a second project approved this
year (Credit 314-SE and Loan 335-SE) should soon be showing an operating surplus.
A loan for the Dakar port (Loan 493-SE) had more immediate success and helped
improve Che finances and administration of the Port Authority. The Bank
Group's first operation in agriculture (Loan 584-SE and Credit 140-SE) was
a project to improve groundnut and millet cultivation. It suffered at first
from a sharp fall in groundnut output (paragraph 7) which caused a drop in
demand for credit and which led to the cancellation of the loan. In 1971,
combination of the Government's strong action, and good weather conditions,
iermitted the recovery of groundnut production; the credit is now expected to
be fully disbursed by the end of 1972. A 1960 credit for construction and
maintenance of feeder roads in the groundnut basin (Credit 198-SE) has been
satisfactorily implemented.
18.       The Government and the Bank both emphasize now the diversification
of agricultural production and development of new productive sectors. Tne
Casamance Rice project (Credit 252-SE) approved in 1971 (paragraph 26), the
Terres Neuves project (Credit 254-SE), also of 1971, (paragraph 25), and the
presently proposed River Polders project, all aim at developing new crops and
opening up new agricultural regions. However, in view of Senegal's limited
agricultural potential, we are actively exploring with the Government other
avenues for diversification. Perhaps the most promising of these is tourism,
for which Senegal's pleasant climate and attractive beaches are important
assets. A Bank mission is currently in the field reviewing the prospects for
Senegalese tourism within the context of the overall development of the sector
in West Africa. The Dakar airport project approved in November will facilita.e
tourism development. Other possibilities for diversification currently being
examined by the Bank include fisheries and manufacturing. The Government has
also asked the Bank to take the lead in assessing the viability of a large
tanker repair project, and we are considering the possibility of an engineer-
ing loan to prepare it.
19.       Other areas in which the Bank is involved are urbanization, for which
a Site and Services project (Credit 336-SE) was recently approved, and educa-
tion, for which a general education project is being prepared following a
credit in 1971 (Credit 253-SE) for technical and agricultural education. In-
stitution-building and improvement in the performance of public enterprises and
services will continue to be important themes in Bank Group lending in Senegal.
Examples of these include the telecommunications project approved in November,
a power project being prepared, and a highway rehabilitation project which
has been appraised recently and which is expected to be submitted to the
Executive Directors for approval this fiscal year.
PART III: THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
20.       Agriculture plays a central role in Senegal's economy; it employs
over seventy percent of the total labor force, and contributes more than
thirty percent to GDP. The agricultural sector is primarily dependent on
a single crop, groundnuts, which produces about sixty percent of the total
value added of the sector.



- 6 -
21.       Agricultural development is severely restr:icted by ecojogical
conditions and human problems.   Soils are generally poor and light, and
rainfall is low and limited to three or four months of the year.    Mosz cf
the population is centered in the North, where millet and groundnuts are
about the only crops that can be grown without irrigation. Overpopulation
in this region prescribes farms that are uneconomic in size; and undel-ut-    a-1
tion of fertilizers has further impoverished soils.    Rural poten-ial _o.-
cultivation of rice, cotton and fruit is greater in the sparsely -opulated
south and southeast, but develcipment is hampered by lack of feede-; roads and
other infrastructure.
22.       In the years immediately following independence, the gover:nmeie.
assigned low priority to agricultural development in distributing public
investment programs and current budget expenditures. At a time when inzroC.-c-
tion of new crops and new techniques and development of new regions requirecI
special efforts to provide adequate extension services and to improve transPcrc
facilities and rural infrastructure, the efficiency of agricultural and o.;-
government services concerned with the rural sector deteriorated seriously.
23.       During the Third Plan period (1969/70-1972/73), however, the gov-
ernment undertook several programs to meet the nost urgent needs of the rurral
sector; and the forthcoming Fourth Plan (1973/74-1976/77) aims at expanding
and intensifying these efforts, with the help of the Bank Croup and other
donors such as FED and FAC. The main aspects of the new government strategy
for agricultural development is directed at: (i) increasing productivity of
groundnut and millet; (ii) developing under-utilized land in the southeast;
and (iii) diversifying agricultural production.
24.       Production of groundnut and millet will continue to play a dominant
role in Senegal's agriculture for some time and productivity increases are
essential to maintain and expand present output levels in the face of the
projected decline in export prices.   A follow-up project to the first Bank/IDA
groundnut/millet operation has just been appraised. It may be followed in a
few years by another project which would involve introduction of sophisticated
cultivation techniques in the more fertile southern end of the groundnut basin,
and strengthening the role of cooperatives by management training and fi-
nancing of equipment.
25.       Tne first Bank Group Terres Neuves project is mainly a pilot scheme
to test the most effective methods of facilitating settlement in the southi-
east. The project involves construction of feeder roads, warehouses and
wells, resettlement of 300 families and provision of extension services; i-
also includes detailed studies on the human and technical problems of large-
scale migration which will pave the way for a rizuch larger follow-up project.
26.       Rice, cottoin and vegetables are the most promising crops for further
agricultural diversification. D)omestic production of rice, depending on
climatic conditions, has been around 100,000 tons while rice consumption has
increased steadily reaching 300,000 tons in 1970, making Senegal West Africa's



-7-
largest importer of rice at an annual foreign exchange cost of about US$25
million. About 80 percent of domestically produced rice is grown in the
Casamance Region. Rice is the second most important food in Senegal. The
relatively small Casamance project (FY71 is designed to develop suitable
approaches to increase rice production in the South, and, if successful,
will be followed by a larger operation. But the Casamance region alone
cannot meet Senegal's projected rice demand, and additional production is
required elsewhere, mainly along the Senegal river in the North, the location
of the proposed River Polder project, where conditions for production are
favorable and where population is relatively dense with few alternative
opportunities for productive employment.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
27.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Senegal River Polder Project"
(29-SE) is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. A
Credit and Project Summary is provided in Annex III.
28.       The Government of Senegal has asked the Bank to help finance further
irrigation development in the Delta of the Senegal River. The project was
identified by a FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program (CP) mission in June 1969 and
was subsequently prepared by French consultants with the assistance of CP
and PMWA. The project was appraised in March/April 1972. Negotiations took
place from Nqovember 6 to 10 with a delegation headed by the Secretary of
State for Planning, Mr. Ousmane Seck.
29.       The project involves expansion of areas under irrigated rice cul-
tivation with existing techniques, and development of a new approach for
double-cropping of rice and vegetables under irrigation. The project covers
the development period 1973-1976 and includes the following principal items:
(a) constructing a new irrigation system at Dagana permitting
the year-round cultivation of 2,730 ha;
(b) improving water control in the Debi cuvette and increasing
the area irrigated from 260 ha to 1,025 ha; and
(c) improving water control in the seven cuvettes forming
the Lanp_ar subproject and increasing the area irrigated
from 880 ha to 1,080 ha.
Complementary project activities would be as follows:
(a) strengthening the Societe d'Amenagement et d'Exploitation
des Terres du Delta (SAED) with staff, facilities, and
equipment to carry out the project and to provide support
for farmers who use land developed under the project;



- 0 -
(b)  constructing, equipping, and staffing a training cenzer
at Dagana for SAkD personnel and fo- farmers;
(c)  carrying out, through collaboration with Institut de
Recherches agronomiques tropicales (IRAT), a program.
of applied research to support agricultural operations
at Dagana; and
(d)  expanding the SAED farm machinery pool to permit of land
preparation services to farmers using land developed under
the project.
30.       The project would be carried out by SAED, an autonomous agency
responsible to the Ministry of Rural Development, SAED is charged with
development of the Delta area through constructing and maintaining water
control works and by providing extension, land cultivation, crecit and
marketing services, and rice processing facilities. It supervises some
9,500 ha of irrigated land, and h-as developed and operated several pumping
stations and a rice mill which has a capacity of 19,000 tons of paddy a year.
Project construction at Debi and Dagana would start in 1973 and De completed
in early 1974, with first crops grown in that year. W4ork at Lampsar would
start in 1974, subject to a finding that there will be no adverse effect on
the water supply for St Louis, and the first crops would be grown in 1975.
All project works would be completed by January 1976. With the existing
echnical assistance, SAED management is satisfactory.    However replacement
of expatriates by Senegalese has been scheduled and is expected to take place
during project implementation.
31.       Project costs are estimated at US$7.4 million, including taxes
of US$1.8 million. The foreign exchange component is estimated to be about
US$3.0 million.   The project would be financed by the proposed IDA credit of
US$4.5 million (80 percent of project costs net of taxes) and the government.
The proceeds of the IDA credit and the government's own contribution would
be passed on to SAED as follows: US$4.3 million, to cover the cost of ir-
rigation works and infrastructure, as a credit for a term of 35 years, in-
cluding a grace period of five years, bearing interest of one percent per
annum, and US$3.1 million as a grant, to cover the costs of project manage-
ment and administration during the developrment period, research and train-
ing. The terrms of the credit component are based on SAED's estimated repay-
ment capacity; this in turn depends primarlily on the fees to be collected
from farmers for services provided under the project. The fees to be paid
by individual farmers and associations of farmers will vary according to
size of holding and cropping pattern, but over all should enable SAED to
recover operation and maintenance costs as well as investment costs charge-
able to the project, including approximately one percent interest, over .he
project's life of 35 years.
32.       International competit-ve bidding would be used to let civil works
contracts amounting to US$5.0 million, and to procure pumping station and



- 9 -
hydraulic equipment, tractors, and tools costing about US$0.9 million. Corn-
tracts for construction of houses and offices estimated to cost US$0.27 mil-
lion would be let by local competitive bidding, as would be selected con-
tracts for minor on-farm development works. Vehicles, motorcycles, furniture,
offic- equipment, tools, and other small equipment, valued at a total of
US$0.08 million, would also be procured by local competitive bidding. Civil
works contracts would be broken into sizes small enough for local contractors
to execute.  Contractors, whether local or foreign, would be permitted to
bid for all or any of the contracts. This arrangement should give optimum
encouragement for foreign and local contractors to compete in the bidding.
33.       The proposed credit would be disbursed against the c.i.f. cost
of imported equipment, 65 percent of the cost of civil works and locally
procured equipment and the full cost of engineering services. The cost
of topographical surveys incurred after May 31, 1972 would be financed
retroactively from the proposed credit within the limit of $100,000.
34.       The principal immediate benefits of the project would be the in-
creinental production of rice from the Lampsar and Debi Polders, and the new
production of rice and other products following development of the Dagana
Polder. The project would, at maturity, generate about US$1.2 million a
year in import savings, mainly from replacing imports of rice and tomato
paste. Per capita incomes of the same 10,000 people participating in the
project are expected to increase from about CFAF 8,000 (or only about 1/3
of the national rural average) to CFAF 20,000 for those farmers in existing
polders, and to CFAF 30,000 for those who would take up land in the new
polders. Thus, the project would benefit a particularly poor segment of
the population. The economic rate of return from investment in the project
is estimated at 14-19 percent for improvements to existing polders, and at
14 percent for the new Dagana Polder.
35.       The Dagana sub-project would be the first irrigation development in
Senegal where farmers would participate in a technically sophisticated scheme
involving double-cropping and cultivation of non-traditional crops, in this
case, tomatoes. This experience should provide the basis for further devel-
opment of irrigation projects in the Senegal river basin.
36.       The Association has considered the international aspects of the
Project and is satisfied that the relevant issues are covered by appropriate
arrangements between the Borrower and the riparian states which are signi-
ficantly involved, i.e. Mali and Mauritania.

C.   Projects in Execution
First Railway Project (FY66)--Credit 96-SE
1.        The project was designed to make the Railways (Regie) technically
and financially sound. All project items, mainly track material and some
rolling stock, have now been delivered and the project will be completed by
the end of 1972, about three years behind the original schedule. Due to the
Regie's internal administrative difficulties, lack of qualified staff to
prepare and issue tender documents and also to labor problems, delivery of
materials and equipment was delayed and, as a result, disbursements were
slow.
2.        The financial performance of the Regie during the first project
was considerably less than expected, principally because traffic did not i.-
crease as expected at the time of appraisal. Furthermore, the Regie's effort
to cut personnel costs was largely offset by an increase in its material costs.
As a result, the Regie is still operating at a loss as compared to a target
rate of return for 1969/70 of 4 percent (as forecast in 1966). The short-
falls in the Regie's performance under Credit 96-SE must be viewed in the
light of the Senegalese and Malian economies' failure to move ahead as rapidly
as expected. The recent economtic recovery in both countries will help to
improve the financial situation of the Regie.
Port of Dakar (FY67)--Credit 493-SE
3.        The first port project, which was approved in 1967, was to improve
Dakar port facilities by extending the wharves, reconstructing quay walls,
and dredging various areas in the port. After slow but satisfactory execu-
tion, the project should be coupleted by the end of 1972.    Special loan

covenants helped to improve the finances and administration of the Port Au-
thority.  The Port Authority, which has recently established a Master Plan
for its future development, is presently considering the extension of its
fishing port and ship repair facilities.
Agricultural Credit Project (FY69)--Credit 140-SE
(Cancelled)
4.        This project is discussed in paragraph 17 of the President's
Report.
First Highway Project (FY70)--Credit 198-SE
5.        The first highway project provided for construction of feeder roads,
purchase of highway maintenance equipment and study of methods of road im-
provement and maintenance. Execution of the project has been satisfactory.
Actual costs are within appraisal estimates and surplus funds available are
being used for providing additional maintenance equipment. The credit is
expected to be fully disbursed by the closing date of December 31, 1972.
6.        Implementation of the maintenance program and rehabilitation of
existing paved roads as recommended by the road improvement and maintenance
study would be financed under a second highway project now under appraisal.
Casamance Rice Project (FY71)--Credit 252-SE
7.        Launched in early 1972, the project is about to complete its first
campaign. Targets for area under cultivation and production have been met
and the construction and marketing programs are on schedule. The quality of
management and extension services is good. There are some delays in the
channelling of funds to the Project Unit but a new arrangement is now being
discussed with the Government.
Education Project (FY71)--Credit 253-SE
8.        Construction of all Project schools is expected to be completed
by January 31, 1975 in accordance with the appraisal schedule. The project
is progressing satisfactorily except for the Merchant Marine School at Dakar,
where there has been a delay in the selection of a fisheries expert; it is
expected that his appointment will be made within six months.
Terres Neuves Resettlement Project (FY71)--Credit 254-SE
9.        Despite a late start due to delays in the establishment of the
project entities, the 1972 first year targets have generally been achieved:
Forty-two families settled in April 1972 and cultivated 100 hectares. Agri-
cultural results are satisfactory and the settlers express satisfaction with
the project.  The preparation of a second phase project is well under way

Second Railway Project (FY72)--Loan 835-SE and Credit 314-SE
10.       This project involves continuation of track renewal towards the
Mali border, modernization of workshops to increase efficiency and thus
improve availability of rolling stock, the purchase of locomotives, and .:
modernization of freight cars to reduce maintenance costs, technical serv-
ices and training. The terminal date for effectiveness of the Loan ana
Credit has been extended from November 1, 1972 to December 29, 1972 to pe,-
mit the Borrower to furnish the. requisite legal opinions. However, specif-
ications and tender documents for the main items have already been preparea
by the Regie and the project should proceed normally and be completed ac-
cording to schedule.
11.       In order to achieve full potential benefits of the Investment
Program and to allow the Regie to reach financial viability by 1975/76 a
Plan of Action has been agreed upon with Government and the Regie. This
Plan outlines measures to be adopted by the Regie to improve operations,
reduce staff, and study certain branch lines which appear to be unprofitable.
