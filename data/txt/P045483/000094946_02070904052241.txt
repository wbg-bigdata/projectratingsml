3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The primary objective of the project was to restore electricity supply in BiH at least cost. The project aimed to help
restore BiH's electricity generation, transmission and distribution systems to meet at least part of the expected
increase in demand within BiH, reconnect many consumers who were still without power after the war, and reduce
power outages, variations in voltage level, and other quality of service defects. It aimed to help minimize
electricity supply costs by focusing on the most cost-effective investinents in the power sector and in the coal mines
which supply the power sector, by rehabilitating economically viable power plants and coal mines, reducing losses
in generation, transmission and distribution, and improving power exchanges within BiH. Power and coal sector
restructuring actions that would help minimize electricity supply costs over the longer term were also promoted
under the project. A secondary objective of the project was to improve cost recovery by the electricity companies,
and to begin the process of making them financially autonomous of the Government in a manner consistent with
the fact that consumer incomes were recovering from extremely low wartime levels. A third objective of the
project was to reduce the environmental impact of electricity generation in BiH by financing investments in
pollution control technologies at coal power stations.
All three objectives were appropriate and reasonable. The focus on rehabilitation and cost recovery was justifiable
since the power sector was still in the early phase of recovery from the conflict that ended in late 1995. The
environmental objective was justified by the need to ensure that the return to production of coal power stations
would not cause unacceptable environmental damage and by the possibility of reducing pollution at low cost. The
focus on least-cost restoration was also appropriate, and the least-cost goal could be partly achieved by choosing
the lowest-cost rehabilitation investments. Key new features of the project, as compared to the Emergency Electric
Power Reconstruction Project, were the inclusion of all three EPs as executing agencies following the
commencement of lending to the RS, and the beginning of reform actions designed to improve coordination within
the power sector, restructure the power sector in a coordinated manner, and restructure the coal sector in FBiH.
These features were ambitious and resulted in some delay in project implementation, but it was appropriate to
include them.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
The following components were included towards these objectives:
(a)    Rehabilitation work at five hydroelectric and four thermal power plants;
(b)    Rehabilitation work on the transmission and distribution networks;
(c)    Rehabilitation work on the coal mines that supply thermal power plants;
(d)    FBiH coal sector restructuring study;
(e)    Technical assistance with project implementation.
3.4 Revised Components:
The components were not revised, although there were revisions to their detailed scope.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
There was no quality at entry review carried out.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
1. Restoration of least cost electricity supply.
The following summarises the outcomes of the physical investments financed under the project in pursuit of the
project's primary objective:
-2 -



EFPBiH
*   Electricity generation from EPBiH plants increased to 5,115 GWh in 2001 from 4,045 GWh in 1998;
*   Demand served within the EPBiH service area increased modestly to 3,500 GWh in 2001 from 3,313 GWh in
1998, with external sales increasing from 732 GWh in 1998 to 1,615 GWh in 2001;
*   The operating life of TPP Tuzla Block 3 was extended for a further 15 years and its availability and reliability
have improved (hours in operation have increased somewhat from 5,976 in 1995 to 6,206 in 2001). In
addition, district heating for the town of Tuzla has been ensured for the future, consumption of water in TPP
Tuzla has been reduced, and pollution of underground water reduced as a result of modernizing the ash
transportation system. -
*   Losses in transmission amounted to 2.3% of gross supply by end of 2001, compared to 2.5% in 1998; and in
distribution 9.0% in 2001 compared to 15.6% in 1998;
*   87.2 km of 400kV, 49.6 km of 220 kV, and 52.0 km of 110 kV transmission lines were put into operation,
increasing the quality and reliability of domestic electricity supply, and enabling enhanced inter-EP and
international exchanges of electricity;
*   Transformer substation 220/110/3510 (20) kV Gradacac was rehabilitated with the result that electricity
supply was restored to consumers on the distribution networks in the Gradacac, Derventa and Modrica
regions;
*   49 km of 110 kV, 15 km of 35 kV, and 147 km of 10 (20) kV distribution network overhead lines, as well as
73 km of 10 (20) kV underground cable interconnections, 478 km of low-voltage network cable, four 35/10 kV
transformer substations and 254 10(20)/0.4 kV transformer substations were put into operation, restoring
electricity supply to about 26,000 households and supporting the return of 42,000 refugees.
EF'HZHB
*   Electricity generation increased from 181 GWh in 1998 to 220 GWh in 2001 at HPP Jajce 1; and from 622
GWh in 1998 to 723 in 2001 at HPP Rama. Switchyard equipment originally commissioned in 1957 and 1968
respectively was replaced, greatly increasing reliability and availability at the two plants.
*   HPP Capljina was re-commissioned for pumped storage as of 2001. Electricity generation at the plant
increased as a result from 83 GWh in 1998 to 284 GWh in 2001.
*   Electricity generation from EPHZHB plants increased to 1,639 GWh in 2001 from 1,226 GWh in 1998;
*   Demand served within the EPHZHB service area increased to 3,026 GWh in 2001 from 1,785 GWh in 1998;
*   Losses in transmission amounted to 1.3% of gross supply by end of 2001, in relation to 1.8% in 1998; and in
distribution 27.2% in 2001 compared to 28.0% in 1998;
*   Rehabilitation of the high-voltage network enabled EPHZHB to obtain 1,427 GWh in 2001 from other EPs in
BiH and internationally, as compared to 576 GWh in 1998.
EF'RS
* Electricity generation increased from 1,1 13 GWh in 1998 to 1,117 GWh in 2001 at TPP Gacko. Electricity
generation decreased from 1,177 GWh in 1998 to 933 GWh in 2001 at TPP Ugljevik. Although the plant
overhaul was completed, the planned production of 1,250 GWh in 2001 could not be achieved because of
insufficient coal production over the short-terrn;
*   Electricity generation by EPRS increased to 4,676 GWh in 2001 from 4,217 GWh in 1998;
*   Demand served within the EPRS service area increased to 3,710 GWh in 2001 from 2,883 GWh in 1998;
* Losses in transmission amounted to 2.2% of gross supply by end of 2001, compared to 3.2% in 1998; and in
distribution to 26.5% in 2001 in relation to 27.8% in 1998;
* Rehabilitation of the high voltage network enabled EPRS to increase inter-EP and international exchange of
electricity from 1,295 GWh in 1998 to 1,601 GWh in 2001;
*   Reconstruction and rehabilitation of the low-voltage network enabled EPRS to put 14 20/10 kV transforner
substations and 15 10/0.4 kV transformer substations into operation in the Bijelina area, and to re-electrify 9
villages in the Brcko area, ensuring electricity supply to some 20,000 returning refugees.

2. Improving cost recovery of the EPs.
The following summarises the outcomes associated with credit conditions supporting the project's secondary
objective:
Billing and collection.
The collection performance of all three EPs improved. However, despite improved financial performance, none of
the three EPs met the covenanted level of collections as a percentage of cash operating costs, which were
ambitious:
*   EPBiH: collections as a percentage of total billings rose from 92% in 1998 to 97% in 2001. Collections as a
percentage of cash operating costs improved from in 110% in 1998 to 116% in 2001. The ratio covenanted for
2000 (the last planned year of the project) was 165%.
*   EPHZHB: collections as a percentage of total billings rose from 65% in 1998 to 74% in 2001. Collections as a
percentage of cash operating costs, however, fell slightly from 126% in 1998 to 124% in 2001. The ratio
covenanted for 2000 (the last planned year of the project) was 185%.
*   EPRS: collections as a percentage of total billings rose from 69% in 1998 to 97% in 2001. Collections as a
percentage of cash operating costs improved from 110% in 1998 to 131% in 2001. The ratio covenanted for
2000 (the last planned year of the project) was 140%.
Summary of financial performance.
On an accrual basis, all three EPs generally improved their financial performance:
*   EPBiH: the loss on operations was reduced from KM 62.8 million in 1998 to KM to KM 50.1 million
(provisional) in 2001.
*   EPHZHB: from a loss on operations of KM 11.7 million in 1998 there was an improvement to a profit of KM
0.6 million (provisional) in 2001.
* EPRS: the loss on operations increased from KM 115.0 million in 1998 to KM 192.2 million in 2000, but fell
in 2001 to KM 134.0 million (provisional).
Debt service.
Throughout the project, all three EPs met the debt service coverage covenant (net internal cash generation to cover
debt service 1.5 times).
Cash payments to coal mines in the FBiH.
EPBiH made good progress in increasing the proportion of coal deliveries paid in cash, in spite of the generally
unfavourable macroeconomic environment in this respect (see Paragraph 38 below). In 2001, they complied
comfortably with the covenant (at least 50% cash payments), with 83.5% of coal deliveries paid in cash, and the
remaining 16.5% offset directly against electricity supplied to the mining companies.
3. Reducing environmental impact of electricity generation.
Under the project, environmental investments to reduce pollutant emissions from the smoke stacks and improve the
handling of waste ash were successfully completed at TPP Tuzla and TPP Gacko. In addition, an EMP was
prepared by each EP at the beginning of the project. These were reviewed by a Bank environmental specialist for
the MTR in October, 2000, and progress with their implementation was found to be satisfactory. Those measures
which could not be implemented under the project for lack of donor financing have been included under the Third
Electric Power Reconstruction Project, and will be financed by EBRD.

4:2 Outputs by components:
1. Physical Components.
The following summarises the outputs of the physical investments financed under the project.
EF'BiH
ID.4 financed components:
*   The IDA financed components implemented by EPBiH related to the reconstruction, rehabilitation, and
environmental improvement of TPP Tuzla. The six components identified at appraisal were successfully
implemented with completion dates between May 2000 (EPBiH G-02 - Coal Handling System) and April
2001 (EPBiH G-06 - Spare Parts for Generating Units). Due to the favorable movement of the SDR relative to
European exchange rates during 1999 - 2001, some funds remained unused from the amount allocated for
these investments at appraisal. As a result, EPBiH submitted a request to procure a new package (EPBiH
G-07A - Ash Transportation System Modernization) under the credit. As this was an environmentally
important investment, this request was accepted, and the implementation of this additional component was
completed in December 2001.
Parallelfinanced components:
*   The EC    financed investments in the reconstruction  of distribution  networks in  Unsko-Sanski,
Tuzlanski-Podrinjski, Zenieko-Dobojski, and Sarajevo Cantons (EPBiH D-04) were completed in December,
2001. All US$ 4.6 million of the allocated funds were disbursed.
* The USAID financed investments in the reconstruction of distribution networks in Tuzlanski-Podrinjski,
Zenieko-Dobojski, and Sarajevo Cantons (EPBiH D-01) were completed in September 1998. All US$ 9.64
million of the allocated funds were disbursed.
* The UK financed investments in the rehabilitation of TPP Tuzla (EPBiH G-07, G-08, and G-09) were
completed in May 1998. All US$ 3 million of the allocated funds were disbursed.
*   The JICA, UK, and Canada financed investments in transmission equipment for installation in the FBiH
(EPBiH T-01 and Inter-Entities T-01 to T-05) were completed between September and December 1998. US$
14.6 million were disbursed against investments implemented by EPBiH.
*   The Netherlands financed investments in the reconstruction of distribution networks in Unsko-Sanski Canton
(EPBiH D-02 and D-03) were completed in April 1998. All US$ 1.10 million of the allocated funds were
disbursed.
*   There has been a substantial delay in the starting of procurement for the OECF / JBIC financed investments in
the rehabilitation of TPP Kakanj (EPBiH G- I to G-14) and the FBiH coal mines (RUT C-01 to C-05 and
RUSB C-07 to C-I 1). The Credit was made effective on December 4, 2000, but amendments to the Credit
Agreement and the Project Agreement were required to accommodate the respecification of the projects, and
were signed in February 2001. All tenders have now been issued. At the time of writing, bid evaluation for the
two most important components (automation of the TPP Kakanj Block 5 and reconstruction of TPP Kakanj
Block 7) was under way and the signing of these contracts was expected in May 2002, so that completion of
implementation would be in 2003.
EF'HZHB
ID.4 financed components:
*   Four of the 7 IDA financed components implemented by EPHZHB related to the reconstruction and
rehabilitation of HPP Jajce, HPP Rama, and HPP Capljina. These components were successfully implemented
with completion dates between October 2000 (EPHZHB G-03 - 110kV Circuit Breakers, and EPHZHB G-04 -
Line and Busbar Disconnectors, both for HPP Jajce I) and December 2000 (EPHZHB G-01 - 220kV
Substation at HPP Rama, and EPHZHB G-06 - compressed air facilities at HPP Capljina). The other three
IDA financed components, for the reconstruction of the Stolac - Mostar 2 110kV transmission line (EPHZHB
T-01 - Conductor and Ground Wire; EPHZHB T-02 - Insulators and Accessories; and EPHZHB T-03 - Steel
- 5 -



Structures), could not be implemented since EPBiH was unable to finance its share of this cross-Entity
transmission line. The cost savings from not implementing these components, plus savings resulting from the
favorable movement of the SDR relative to European exchange rates from 1999 to 2001, were used for HPP
Capljina and HPP Rama (Lot A - 245kV Circuit Breakers with accessories and Lot B - Switchyard
Equipment with accessories). Delivery of these lots was completed in November 2001.
Parallelfinanced components:
* The USAID financed investments in the reconstruction of distribution networks in Posavski and
Srednjobosanski Cantons (EPBiH D-01 to D-04) were completed in September 1998. All US$ 4.95 million of
the allocated funds were disbursed.
*   The EC financed investments in the reconstruction of distribution networks in Posavski, Srednjobosanski, and
Zapadnobosanski Cantons (EPHZHB D-01 to D-04) were under implementation at the time of writing. US$
0.47 million of the US$ 4.71 allocated funds had been disbursed. The estimated completion date is December
2002.
*   The JICA, UK, and Canada financed investments in inter-Entity transmission equipment for installation in the
FBiH (Inter-Entities T-01 to T-05) were completed in December 1998. All US$ 4.18 million of the funds
allocated for investments implemented by EPHZHB were disbursed.
*   Assistance in procurement was provided by Canada to the PIU.
EPRS
IDA financed components:
*   At appraisal, 10 components to be implemented by EPRS were identified for financing out of the IDA Credit,
relating to the rehabilitation and environmental improvement of TPP Gacko, and the rehabilitation and
provision of spare parts for HPP Bocac and HPP Trebinje. Changes were made to the procurement plan over
the project's implementation period, however, due on the one hand to the repackaging of the original
components in order to minimize bid prices, and on the other to the reallocation of excess funds resulting from
cost savings due to favorable exchange rate movements. The repackaging involved: (i) separation of
component EPRS G-02 into three lots; (ii) combining parts of EPRS G-09 and G-14 to form a new package
EPRS G-09/14, with 7 lots, and dividing the remainder into two new packages, EPRS G-09.1 and EPRS
G-09.2; and (iii) combining EPRS G-10 and G-15 to forn a single package G-10/15, with 5 lots. The cost
savings were used on the following priority investments: (i) US$ 0.6 million equivalent for a new component
EPRS G-02A (a new plant control and monitoring system for TPP Gacko); (ii) EPRS G-02D (an additional
ash transportation compressor for TPP Gacko); and (iii) EPRS G-09.3 (0.4 kV circuit breakers for HPP
Bocac).
Parallelfinanced components:
*   The ODA financed procurement of turbine and generator auxiliary equipment for TPP Gacko (EPRS G-03)
was completed in August 1999. All US$ 0.29 million of the allocated funds were disbursed.
*   The procurement of spare parts (EPRS G-05) and maintenance equipment (EPRS G-06) for TPP Ugljevik, for
which finance had not been secured at the time of appraisal, was financed according to a reduced scope, and
was completed in December 2000. US$ 1.59 million were disbursed against these components.
*   The EC financed investments in the reconstruction of the transmission network in the Srebrenica, Prijedor -
Banja Luka, and Gorazde areas (EPRS T-01 to T-04) were under implementation at the time of writing;
completion is expected by the end of 2002. US$ 1.1 million of the US$ 1.9 allocated funds had been
disbursed.
* The Canada financed investments in the reconstruction of the 110/35/lOkV transformer substation Breko 2
(EPRS T-06 to T-09) were completed in 1999. All of the US$ 1.5 million allocated funds were disbursed.
*   The UK and USAID financed investments in the reconstruction of distribution networks in the Banja Luka,
Doboj, Bjeljina, Pale, and Trebinje regions (EPRS D-0l to D-05) were completed in 2001. US$ 2.0 million of
the US$ 3.2 funds allocated from the UK were disbursed, and all US$ 5.3 million of the funds allocated from
USAID were disbursed. The EC financed investments were under implementation at the time of writing, and
US$ 1.8 million of the US$ 2.1 million allocated funds had been disbursed.

*   The JICA, UK, and Canada financed investments in transmission equipment for installation in the RS
(Inter-Entities T-01 to T-05) were completed in December 1998. US$ 13.6 million were disbursed against
investments implemented by EPRS.
*   There has been a substantial delay in the starting of procurement for the OECF / JBIC financed investments in
mechanical spare parts, bulldozers, and tires for the coal mines at TPP Ugljevik (EPRS C-13 to C-15) and
auxiliary mining equipment and spare parts for the coal mines at TPP Gacko (EPRS C-17 and C-18). The
Credit was made effective on December 4, 2000, but amendments to the Credit Agreement and the Project
Agreement were required to accommodate the respecification of the projects, and were signed in February
2001. The single tender that will financed by the credit has been issued. At the time of writing, delivery of the
contracted equipment is expected by the end of 2002, so that completion of implementation would be in 2003.
*   Assistance in procurement was provided by Canada to the PIU.
2. Power Sector Reform.
The following summarizes the outputs associated with credit conditions conceming the reform of the
power sector.
* FBiH Coal Sector Restructuring Study. Two studies were commissioned by the FBiH Government under the
project. The first, "Feasibility Study on the Middle Bosnia and Tuzla Coal Mines for the Federation of Bosnia
and Herzegovina", prepared by Marston Mining Engineers & Consultants under financing of the US TDA,
was a technical study of options for the restructuring of the coal mining sector in the FBiH. The final report
was submitted to the FBiH Govemment in March 2001. The second study, "Recommendations to Mitigate the
Social Consequences of Coal Mine Restructuring in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina", was funded
and prepared by the Intemational Labor Affairs Bureau, US Department of Labor (DOL). The final report was
submitted to the FBiH Government in June 2001. Following intemal verification of the reports, the FBiH
MoE began an extensive process of consultation on their results with Cantonal and Municipal govemments
and the mining industry in late 2001. At the time of writing, the FBiH Govemment had informed the Bank
that the deadline by which it would establish a comprehensive restructuring plan based on the two studies is
the end of May 2002.
* Electricity tariff study. A study on the level of electricity tariffs was undertaken by a consortium of Fichtner
and the Electricity Supply Board of Ireland, financed by the EBRD, and completed in February 1999. This
study has provided the basis for a series of tariff reforms in both Entities over the life of the project. The
average tariff for EPBiH residential consumers rose from 7.9 Pf/kWh in 1998 to 11.12 Pf/kWh in 2001. The
average tariff for EPHZHB consumers on the distribution network rose from 10.57 Pf/kWh in 1998 to 12.81
Pf/kWh in 2001. A unified tariff structure was introduced in the FBiH in April 2001. The average tariff for
EPRS consumers on the distribution network rose from 7.66 Pf/kWh in 1998 to 12.25 Pf/kWh in 2001. As
shown in Annex 1, the tariff levels for household consumers and some industrial consumers are still below the
corresponding long-run marginal costs.
4.3 Net Present Value/Econonmic rate of return:
The economic rate of return at the end of the project was estimated to be 16% using the same method as at
appraisal. This involved estimating the rate of return on a time slice of the investment programs of the three EPs,
because it was not possible to separate the benefits of the project investments from the benefits of the overall
investment programs. At appraisal, the investment time slice analyzed was for the period 1996 through 1999. The
re-estimate was based on the investment time slice for the period 1996-2001, since the last IDA financed project
investments were completed only in 2001 (cofinanced expenditures in 2002 or later were omitted). The benefits
were taken to be the incremental electricity sales revenue compared to sales revenue in 1996. The IRR is
satisfactory since it exceeds the opportunity cost of capital, taken to be 12% at the time of appraisal. However, the
IRR is lower than the 26% value estimated at appraisal. The reasons for the lower result are: (i) lower average
electricity prices; (ii) the inclusion of two extra years of investments without correspondingly larger benefits as the
investments with the greater benefits were carried out earlier; and (iii) higher marginal costs of coal production
prior to 2003 because of delays in coal sector investments and restructuring.
- 7 -



The above estimates of the IRR are underestimates since they do not take account of consumers' surplus. Including
the consumers' surplus on incremental billed sales on the distribution network would raise the IRR to 36%.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
The financial rate of return is also 16%, since it was calculated in the same way and using the same assumptions as
the economic rate of return. There were no taxes to be taken into account.
4.5 Institiutional development impact:
The project played a central role in leveraging the reform of the institutional structure of the BiH power sector,
through a combination of conditionality and the provision of technical assistance and intermediation between the
various political groups in BiH. The following summarizes the major achievements under the project:
*   ZEKC - the Joint Power Coordination Center, and operation of the BiH power system. Under the project, the
three EPs were required to jointly establish and maintain an Electricity Coordinating Center with such
functions and powers as were deemed satisfactory by the Association and the three EPs. In accordance with
this covenant, the Joint Power Coordination Center (ZEKC) was established under an agreement signed on
November 3, 1998 between the three EPs. Over the lifetime of the project, ZEKC has become institutionalized
as an important instrument in the management of the BiH power system, performing both operational
functions such as the monitoring of load flows on the entire system and the provision of early waming to the
EP dispatch centers of potential problems as they arise; and strategic functions such as the drafting of a Grid
Code for the BiH system, and the preparation of the SCADA system project that forms part of Power 3. There
has been substantial investment in communications and monitoring systems in order to facilitate ZEKC's
work. The Entity Governments and the three EPs have agreed that ZEKC will be converted into a full
Independent System Operator for the BiH system under the Third Electric Power Reconstruction Project.
* FBiH and RS electricity legislation. With Bank assistance, a joint working group of the FBiH and the RS
prepared coordinated electricity policy statements, and then new electricity laws based on these. Technical
assistance in the preparation of the policy statements was provided by the UK DFID, and in the drafting of the
legislation by NORAD. The electricity policy statements were approved by the RS and FBiH Governments on
April 20, 2000 and May 5, 2000 respectively. The FBiH draft electricity law was submitted to the FBiH
parliament on May 30, 2000, and the RS draft law was submitted to the RS parliament on April 19, 2001. In
the meantime, it was agreed to have a State electricity law as well. This was approved by the BiH Parliament
on March 21, 2002. The draft Entity laws are currently being revised to conform to the State law.
*   FBiH and RS power sector regulatory reform and restructuring actions. The FBiH and RS Govemments
jointly commissioned a study of options for the restructuring and privatization of the EPs in BiH, which was
undertaken by PA Consulting of the US, with USAID financing. The study was completed in December,
2001, and at the time of writing, the Entity Governments are preparing Privatization and Restructuring Action
Plans based on this study, the submission of which to the Bank is a condition of the Third Electric Power
Reconstruction Project.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
*   Constitutional structure of BiH and structure of the power sector. As a result of the 1992-95 war, BiH has a
very peculiar constitutional structure, and a structure for the power sector which reflects this. Neither is
conducive to efficient formulation and implementation of power sector policy. The making of decisions that
have effects throughout the power sector is highly decentralized. This is true both of decisions regarding
power sector policy, which are made by both of the two Entity governments, and of those regarding
commercial and technical policy, which are made by each of the three EPs. The result is that extensive
coordination problems regularly arise. The establishment of ZEKC under the project is an important first step
in resolving this coordination problem as far as it relates to technical decisions concerning the operation of the
transmission and distribution networks.
-8 -



* Political instability in BiH. A factor that greatly complicated the achievement of all the project objectives was
the frequent changes of govermments at all levels in BiH. There were two general elections and a number of
internal reshuffles over the lifetime of the project. The resulting changes in Ministry and EP personnel made
it difficult to build up and maintain momentum behind almost any kind of initiative, from operational
decisions related to the implementation of the project's physical components to structural reforms in the
energy sector.
* Difficult project implementation conditions in the RS. In the BiH reconstruction program as a whole (not just
in the power sector), donor assistance to the RS was in general much delayed compared to that in the FBiH for
a variety of reasons. These delays in disbursement of donor commitments prompted reallocation of funds from
EPRS's own resources or from other donors in some cases. This often induced further delays, since the
original donors had to reappraise investment needs following such reallocations.
5.2 Factors generallt subject to government control:
*   Macroeconomic environment. The macroeconomic environment in BiH did not develop as positively as had
been foreseen by the Bank and the governments in BiH at the start of the project. Macroeconomic growth, and
in particular the revival of industrial production, was much slower over the period 1998-2001 than had been
anticipated, with the result that growth in domestic electricity demand was lower than forecast, and there was
a reluctance to raise electricity.prices further.
* Governance of EPs. There is excessive government interference in the functioning of the EPs, with all major
operational and financial decisions being taken only after consultation with the relevant Ministry or at the
behest of the Ministry. Changes in the senior management of all three EPs occurred during the project
implementation period. In addition, the headquarters of EPRS were relocated twice. For most of the project
implementation period, the PIU was required to maintain offices in both Banja Luka in the north of BiH and
Trebinje in the south (approximately six hours' drive apart).
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agencv control:
* The performance of the implementing agencies was generally satisfactory.
5.4 Costs and financing:
Planned costs andfinancing: At the time of appraisal, the total cost of the project (including non-IDA financed
components) including contingencies was estimated at US$ 169.74 million equivalent, of which the IDA financed
components would account for US$ 25.00 million equivalent (SDR 18.50 million). Of the IDA financed
components, the cost of investments in power generation was estimated at US$ 23.96 million equivalent; of
investments in transmission at US$ 0.54 million equivalent; and of project implementation support at US$ 0.50
miillion equivalent. There was a financing gap of US$ 3.76 million at the time of appraisal, relating to investments
at TPP Ugljevik, inter-Entity transmission investments, and the Coal Sector Restructuring Study for the FBiH.
Ac tual costs andfinancing: The actual cost of the IDA financed components was US$ 24.65 million equivalent;
though this total includes additional packages that could be financed due to favorable exchange rate movements
over the lifetime of the project. Of this total, the actual cost of investments in power generation was US$ 23.68
million equivalent; and of project implementation support US$ 0.28 million equivalent. The investments in
transmission were dropped and the funds reallocated. The actual cost of the total project as implemented is
estimated at this time at US$ 159 million - although it should be noted that the scope of a number of project
cemponents was changed during implementation, and that several components are still under implementation.
Diring project implementation, financing was committed by USTDA for the Coal Sector Restructuring Study for
the FBiH, and by the EBRD for one part of the investments at TPP Ugljevik. The unfinanced investments at TPP
Ugivevik will be financed under the Third Electric Power Reconstruction Project. In addition, significantly more
financing for investments in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of distribution networks was committed by
U'AID during project implementation.

6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
Project sustainability is rated as likely. With regard to technical sustainability, there are no technical reasons why
the benefits from the project components should not be sustainable if the investments are operated as foreseen, and
there is successful continuation of the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the BiH power system under the Third
Electric Power Reconstruction Project. With regard to financial sustainability, it is not possible to form an accurate
judgment of the EPs' financial position and prospects until their assets have been revalued, and the resulting
evaluations are both integrated into their financial statements and used to assess the planned development of tariff
levels. The completion of this process is covenanted under the Third Electric Power Reconstruction Project, and
was under way at the time of writing. The prospects for financial sustainability are relatively favorable for EPBiH,
which has reduced power distribution losses to 10% and raised bill collection to 97%, and for EPHZHB, which
made a profit in 2001, has no fuel costs since it has no thermal power generation, and ensures that the costs of
imported electricity are fully paid for by the large industrial consumers that use it. The financial position of EPRS
remains tenuous, especially since power distribution losses continue at the high rate of 27%, largely due to
non-technical losses. The sustainability of the power sector reform process begun under the Second Electric Power
Reconstruction Project depends over the next several years on the success of the Third Electric Power
Reconstruction Project.  The coal sector reform depends on the determination of FBiH to implement the
recommendations of the two coal studies carried out under the Second Electric Power Reconstruction Project. This
will require closing some mines, investing in the remaining mines, and greatly reducing the number of miners. If
these actions are not fully carried out, the coal will continue to get produced, but costs of production will be too
high, and the cost of EPBiH's thermal power production will be too high as well.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
All of the physical components of the electricity part of the project are being operated under the regular activities of
the three EPs. Current operating costs are being financed out of the operating revenues of the three EPs.
Continued growth in domestic electricity demand plus favorable prospects for exports should ensure that the
facilities rehabilitated under the project are adequately used. The physical coal component will be similarly
incorporated into the regular operations of the coal mines. The project was the second of three projects aimed at
rehabilitating BiH's damaged and deteriorated power sector. The Third Electric Power Reconstruction Project,
now being implemented, is providing further support to the physical, financial and reform goals of the project.
The performance indicators for the Third Electric Power Reconstruction Project will serve for evaluation of the
continued performance of the Second Electric Power Reconstruction Project. The key performance indicators
include: increased power generation and sales; avoided increase in transmission losses; reduced distribution losses;
increased gross power flows between the power companies; passage of electricity laws consistent with EU
Directives and the adopted power sector policy statements; establishment of independent regulatory agencies;
adoption and implementation of action plans for sector restructuring and privatization; reduced particulate
emissions at thermal power stations; improved self-financing of investments; and improved revenue collection
relative to amounts billed.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Satisfactory. The Bank took the lead role in coordinating donors and acted as a catalyst for financing of the
physical components in this respect. In addition, the Bank took an active role in assisting the Borrower with the
identification and financing of technical assistance needs related to the planning and implementation of the power
sector reform program.
7.2 Supervision:
Satisfactory. During the implementation of the project, Bank staff cooperated fully with FBiH and RS MoE and
EPBiH, EPHZHB, and EPRS staff. The frequency of missions was appropriate, with several made on urgent bases
- 10 -



in order to help the implementing agencies resolve imporlant issues under tight time schedules. The large
supervision work load stretched available supervision resources. In addition, a Bank staff member dedicated to the
supervision of the project was maintained full-time in Sarajevo for most of the project lifetime.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Satisfactory.  In addition to its preparation and supervision responsibilities, the Bank made a number of
particularly important contributions. It acted as a catalyst for cooperation between the two Entity governments in
the formulation of a sector reform program and the preparation of new power sector legislation. It assisted in
improving coordination among the EPs through the establishment of ZEKC. It also effectively coordinated a
un,ified stance by the donors which greatly facilitated the achievement of a consensus on the reform program. The
B.mk was also able to obtain donor agreement on a single set of investment priorities. This required extensive
collaboration with the Borrower, implementing agencies and donors, both by the field-based and the
headquarters-based staff.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Setisfactory. The EP PlUs worked under difficult circumstances to coordinate the preparation of the project.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Satisfactory. Although there were frequent delays in achieving various milestones, these were eventually achieved
and thus the overall performance can be considered marginally satisfactory. The restructuring plan for the FBiH
ccal mining industry has taken longer than envisaged. However, the Borrower did resolve the issue of allocation of
alil electric power sector debts to the respective EPs, and the two Entities reached a workable compromise on the
reform of the power sector.
7.6 Inplementing Agencyv:
Satisfactory. The EP PlUs did an excellent job of implementing a large investment program financed by many
different donors. Although there was a six month delay in project effectiveness as a result of a delay in
establishing ZEKC, which ultimately necessitated an extension of the closing date of the credit, its creation was a
significant achievement that helped lay the basis for the next stage of reforms, which were started under this
project and further supported under the Third Electric Power Reconstruction Project. While EPBiH was able to
achieve the power distribution loss reduction targets, EPHZHB and EPRS made insufficient progress in this area.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance
Satisfactory. The overall Borrower performance is rated as satisfactory since the investments were successfully
inmplemented, ZEKC was established and is playing an increasingly important role, and agreement was eventually
reached on power sector reform and draft electricity legislation at the Entity and State levels.
8.. Lessons Learned
The following were the main lessons learned:
*   Too many contracts lead to an excessive supervision workload. The procurement arrangements for the project
proved to be very complex, with a total of 66 contracts eventually being procured under the IDA credit. This
required an excessive supervision effort for the physical components alone.
- 11 -



*   Three governments, three implementing agencies and many parallel financiers also lead to a large
preparation and supervision workload. The decision to finance investments in the service areas of all three
EPs was made because there were priority rehabilitation needs in all three areas. The inclusion of all three
EPs and the two Entity Governments also enabled the project to become a vehicle for improving coordination
within the country-wide power sector. The advantage of the structure of a Bank-led project financed by many
donors in parallel was that a single set of investment priorities was established. The number of parallel
financiers enlisted under the project proved cumbersome, however, given the very variable levels of
commitment and supervision of parallel financed components. The involvement of so many partners in the
project resulted in a significantly enhanced preparation and supervision workload.
*   Usefulness of structures for collaboration. In situations, such as those that existed in BiH, where there are
multiple sector institutions with diverse, and sometimes conflicting, interests and priorities, the establishment
of formal structures for collaboration (such as ZEKC) can contribute significantly to greater cooperation and
harmony between the various institutions.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
The Federation Ministry of Energy, Mining and Industry provided the following comments.
Results of project implementation. The Second Electric Power Reconstruction Project was a continuation of the
postwar reconstruction and rehabilitation that started under the Electric Power Reconstruction Project and the
beginning of sector reformn. The main results of implementation of the project are:
*   increased electricity production and extension of the working life of production facilities;
*   enabling the exchange of electric power between the power utilities;
*   decrease in losses in transmission and distribution;
*   enabling the return of refugees and restarting of industry; and
* decrease in pollution in the thermal power plant areas.
Among the reform actions were preparation of the studies on coal mine restructuring and implementation of
recommendations of the electricity tariff study.
Importance of the World Bank role. Defining the preconditions for effectiveness of the IDA credit resulted in
establishing ZEKC and preparation of electricity laws at the State level as well as the Entity level. As coordinator
of the project the World Bank started the process leading to approval of Policy Statements by the Entity
governments. These Statements led to the electricity laws and the Power Sector Restructuring and Privatization
Study.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits
The table below shows the calculation of the intemal economic rate of return of the project based on the 1996-2001
time slice of the investment programs of the three EPs. The method is the same as was used at the time of
appraisal. However, the time slice used was from 1996-2001 instead of 1996-1999 on the grounds that the last
investments financed under the project were completed only in 2001 (some project investments funded by
cofinanciers were not completed by the end of 2001, and to that extent were not included). Furthermore, the
measurement of benefits was modified. At appraisal, the incremental sales were defined on the basis of
incremental production plus the reduction in power transmission and distribution losses attributable to the
investments. This was a conservative approach since the resulting incremental sales estimates were less than the
forecast increases in sales, which exceeded the increases in production and would, therefore, have required
resorting to electricity imports. It was felt that this approach would give a more accurate estimate of the benefit of
the rehabilitation investments, many of which were for generation. There was also some doubt as to whether the
sales forecast would be achieved. The incremental production was measured as the actual production in each year
through 1999 less the 1996 actual production, with an adjustment made for the fact that actual hydropower
production in 1996 exceeded production in an average year because of favorable hydrological conditions in 1996.
The adjustment consisted of adding to the incremental sales figure in each year the difference between actual
hydropower production in 1996 and the production from the same plants in an average hydrological year.
The end of project measure of benefits consists of actual incremental domestic plus export sales between the end of
1996 and the end of 2001 plus an adjustment for the fact that hydropower production in 1996 was higher than
average by 735 GWh as a result of favorable hydrology. The use of incremental domestic plus export sales was
chosen since the additional sales turned out to be lower than forecast at appraisal and could be supplied entirely
from additional domestic production. For this reason, this approach is consistent with the approach taken at the
time of appraisal. The adjustment consisted of adding a benefit to each year equal to the avoided cost of importing
an equal amount of electricity (valued at a cost per kWh assumed to be equal to the export price in each year).
Without this adjustment, the benefits of bringing the Salakovac and Mostar hydropower stations back into
production would not be captured. The method of calculating the effect of the adjustment differs from the
approach used at appraisal, but it is considered more accurate for the changed scenario.
At appraisal the cost of the coal used for power generation by EPBiH was estimated as the incremental cost of
production of US$ 10.80 per ton resulting from the coal mine investments under the project. For the end of project
estimate the average cost of coal of US$ 25.30 per ton was used for the years up to 2002. This cost is equal to the
incremental cost, in part because the coal mine investments financed under the project have not yet been
completed. For the years from 2003 on, the incremental cost of US$ 10.80 estimated at. appraisal was used. The
costs of coal for EPBiH's thermal power stations are shown in a separate column, since the PAD had provided an
estimate of the incremental cost of production for the coal used by EPBiH. The costs of coal for EPRS's thermal
power stations, as well as all other incremental operating and maintenance costs for all three EPs, are included in
the column labelled O&M.
The other estimates used for the ex-post cost-benefit analysis are actual data for the period to 2001 and forecast
data for 2002. The data for 2002 were assumed to continue until 2012. The last year used for analysis at appraisal
was 2010. The period was extended to 2012 for the ex-post analysis since the investment time slice was extended
from 1999 to 2001.

Intemal Rate of Return            16%
In Section 4.3 of the main text, it is mentioned that the IRR increases to 36% if the consumers' surplus on
incremental sales is included. The consumers' surplus was estimated on the assumption that, on average,
consumers would be willing to pay for half of their consumption a price equal to the cost of producing their own
electricity from individual generators. This cost was estimated to be US$ 15.70 per kWh. This approach is
equivalent to assuming a straight line demand curve passing through the point showing the actual price and
consumption and intersecting the price axis at a price equal to US$ 15.70.

POWER n PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND THEIR REALIZATION
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT
The primary objectives of the project are:
-      continuation of the after-war reconstruction and rehabilitation of the electric power sector in Bosnia -
Herzegovina to provide for continuous electricity supplying of consumers,
-      decrease of interruptions of electricity supplying, increase of reliability and safety in operation of the
electric power sector,
-      increase of electric energy exchange between the electricity companies (Elektroprivredas) on commercial
basis, and
-      promotion of economic - financial circumstances in operation of the Public Enterprise Elektroprivreda of
Bosnia - Herzegovina (EPBiH) and reducing of the risk relating to environment protection.
Key indicator of the business are: increased electricity generation and selling, reducing of losses in electricity
transmission and distribution, promotion of financial performances of business through increased own
participation in investment financing, increased incomes from collection for consumed electricity in relation to
invoiced amounts, increased of incomes in relation to cash operating costs, reducing of particles pollutant emission
from thermal.power plants.
The project implementation start was on 31.03.1999 and completion date 31.12.2001.
REALIZATION
Realization of the Second Power Reconstruction Program enabled that electricity generation in the area covered by
the Public Enterprise EPBiH reached level of 5,115 GWh in 2001 in relation to 4,045 GWh in 1998; consumption
of 3,500 GWh in 2001 in relation to 3,313 GWh in 1998; electricity supply to other companies including also
exported energy (based mainly on commercial arrangements) 1,616 GWh in relation to 734 GWh in 1998.
Electricity losses in transmission network by end of 2001 amount to 2.3% in relation to 2.5% in 1998, and in
distribution 9.02% in relation to 15.6% in 1998. Average prices for electricity consumption in households are
increased and in 2001 they amount to 11.12 pf/kWh in relation to 7.9 pf/kWh in 1998.
Collection for consumed electricity in relation to cash operating costs in years: 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 was
realized respectively in amounts 109.63%, 131.80%, 126.29% and 115.98%.
Losses in business of the EPBiH in 2001 were reduced to KM 50,159 thousands in relation to KM 62,819
thousands in 1998.
By installing of the electrostatic precipitator filters (Power I) emission of particles from the Block 3 in the Thermal
Power Plant Tuzla amounts to 100 mg/Nm3 and in the Thermal Power Plant Kakanj (from the Blocks Nr. 5 and
Nr.6) amounts to 380 - - 340 mg(Nm3. By beginning of 1999 it was established the Joint Power Coordination
Center to coordinate operation of the electric power system in Bosnia - Herzegovina, so in such a way
pre-conditions were created for a reliable and efficient transmission of electric energy in Bosnia -Herzegovina on
integrated basis including fulfilling of other conditions of the UCTE.
But in addition to all these accomplishments, further investment are also necessary in order to continue the
program of after-war reconstruction as well as to create conditions for implementation of detailed program of
restructuring and privatization of the electric power sector in Bosnia - Herzegovina, which is to be realized through
the Power 111 Project.

A.      REALIZATION OF THE PROJECT
All.    Generation Facilities
1.     Thermal Power Plant Tuzia (Second Phase USD 15.921 millions)
It includes continuation of activities from the previous reconstruction program (Power I) for the aim of complete
rehabilitation and ecologic reconstruction of the Block 3 (100 MW) focusing to the common auxiliary plants and
providing the spare parts needed for a reliable operation of the Blocks of 32 MW rated power.
Within these works following projects were realized: rehabilitation of the cooling tower, replacement of the
Instrumentation & Control System of the Block 3, replacement of the 6 kV switchgear and protecting relays of the
Block 3, reconstruction of coal transport and handling system, reconstruction of chemical preparation of water,
procurement of needed spare parts as well as for the Block 4: reconstruction of the hydraulic ash transport and
transition to the dry ash transport (this Project was approved subsequently).
By realization of these projects it was achieved complete rehabilitation of the Block 3 in the TPP Tuzla as well as
its repairing for improved ecologic environment protection. In such a way the life time of the Block 3 was also
extended for further 15 years and achieved a its significant improvement of availability, reliability and economic
operation. Besides, in such a way it was provided also a reliable source for the Tuzla district heating during the
next period, reduced consumption of water in the Thermal Power Plant Tuzla and also reduced level of pollution of
urLderground waters.
2.     Thermal Power Plant Kakanj (Second Phase USD 8.29 millions planned)
It includes continuation of activities from the previous program (Power I) in rehabilitation of the Blocks Nr.5 and
Nir. 6 (2x 110 MW) in the Thermal Power Plant Kakanj focusing to the common auxiliary plants as well as
maintenance of the Blocks of 32 MW rated power. The Project is finances from the JBIC Credit.
Duae to the slow and complex administrative procedures of the JBIC, implementation of this Credit indicates a
sigynificant delaying, i.e. it started just from July 2001. In between, the reallocation was done conceming
investments and the Credit funds are being predominantly directed to solve current problems in operation of the
BMlock 7 (230 MW) and its repairing for purpose of improved ecologic environment protection, as regulated by the
Amendment to the Loan Agreement and the Project Contract. Completion of this Project is expected by middle of
2004.
A.2    Power Transmission facilities
3.     Rehabilitation of the Inter-Entity Transmission Facilities (USDI 6.151millions)
In the Transformer Substations the electricity metering equipment was installed to record the energy exchanges
between the electricity companies and between the neighboring states. It was also installed telecommunication
ecquipment in function of power transmission and information exchanges as well as microprocessor based
protecting relays on the Inter-Entity transmission lines in order to provide highest quality in operation and
selectivity of protective relays. The funds were provided from the donation of Japan, UK and Canada as well as
own funds of the Public Enterprise EPBi3H.
U'ithin the frame of this Project 87.2 km of the 400 kV overhead line was put into operation and a part of the
purchased equipment (conductor ropes, insulation equipment, suspension and connection material) will be used
within a frame of implementation of the Power 1II Project.
By repairing and putting in operation of 49.6 km of the 220 kV Transmission Line TPP TUZLA - GRADACAC -
JAKOVO it was increased stability in operation of the electric power system and the conditions were created for
- 27 -



electric energy exchanges with the Republic of Croatia.
By rehabilitation of the "110 kV Ring" in the power network, it was put into operation 52.0 km of the 110 kV
Transmission Lines in the area controlled by the Public Enterprise EPBiH.
In such a way it was provided safe and reliable electricity supplying to the consumer areas of the Graeanica,
Maglaj, Teslie and Lopare places.
4.     Rehabilitation of Transmission Facilities in the BiH-Federation (USD 3,908 millions)
The Transformer Substation TS 220/110/3510 (20) kV Gradaeac was completed and in such a way new electricity
power of 170 MVA was put into service. So, sufficient quantities of electric energy were provided for distributive
consumers in regions of the Gradaeac, Derventa and Modriea places.
A.3.   Distribution
5. :   Rehabilitation of Distribution Networks in the B i H. Federation (USD 24.023 millions)
It includes completion and putting in operation 49 km of 110 kV Transmission Lines, 15 km of 35 kV
Transmission Lines and 147 kV of 10 (20) kV Transmission Lines as well as 73 km of underground cable
interconnections of 10 (20) kV rated voltage, 478 km of Low Voltage network, 4 (four) Transformner Substations
35/10 kV and 254 (Two hundred fifty four) Transformer Substations 10(20)/0.4 kV in regions of the Cantons: Una
- Sana, Middle Bosnia, Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zenica - Doboj, Bosnian Drina and Herzegovina - Neretva. By the above
mentioned reconstruction of the medium voltage network and low - voltage network it was provided electricity
supplying to about 26,000 households and return of 42,000 refugees. In addition to that, pre-conditions were
created for continuous operation of industrial consumers.
B.     THE IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
6.     In order to manage and coordinate implementation of the sub-projects on the level of the B.H. Federation,
within the Federal Ministry of Energy, Mining and Industry the Federal PIU was established with its Branch
Offices in EPBiH and EP Mostar. The Elektroprivredas have been responsible for the implementation of their
own sub-projects. Unique Account is established at the Federal PIU level.
Within the PE EPBiH the Project implementation unit PIU was established. It was supported by the experts from
the management and entities for generation, transmission and distribution of the EPBiH and also by related
departments for the procurement, legal affairs, financing, budgeting, accounting, cost control, scheduling,
technical support, personal support, and by foreign and local consulting companies.
The PIU has completely implemented the IDA financed projects. Donation funds from UK, Japan, Canada,
Netherlands, USAID and European Commission were implemented by their authorized agencies DFID, GEMCO,
Parsons and SAFEGE (ESB International Ltd.) and in coordination with PIU-EPBiH in preparation of the
technical specifications, evaluation reports, coordination in follow-up, reporting and project management. In this
project too, the installation of the equipment were performed by the EPBiH's personnel.
The installation of the large equipment in the generation facilities was made by the suppliers on the "turn key"
basic with the engagement of the local companies as subcontractors wherever it was acceptable. The design
replacement and installation of generation, transmission and distribution equipment was performed by appropriate
local entities of EPBiH with their maintenance personnel having great experience in such works.
C.     BANK PERFORMANCE
7.     Starting with the Second Electric Power Reconstruction Project and particularly with preparation of the
SEPRP, the performance of the Bank is appraised as satisfactory:
- 28 -



-       in the project identification
-       in the priority defining
-      in the Projects preparation assistance
-       in al phases of the project's appraisal
-       in the follow-up and supervision of each specific contract and the project as a whole
-       in realization of the leading (coordinating) position with all other donors (cofinanciers).
D.      PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER AND BENEFICIARY
8.     The performance of the Government of BiH and the Government of the Federation of BiH is satisfactory.
The Reconstruction and International Assistance Sector of the Council of Ministers and of Ministry of Foreign
Trade and International Relations of BiH has received all available information and received the Project Progress
Reports. The full support was provided by Federal Ministry of Energy, Mining and Industry.
The management of the EPBiH was giving continuous supports to the Project. Specifically significant contribution
of the EPBiH's management was in providing EPBiH own funds for the Project (implementation including local
fuinds for installation works, procurement of local goods and materials with a total value of US$12.83mill.). This
all means that the performance of the Beneficiary and EPBiH, could be considered as satisfactory.
E.      KEY LESSONS LEARNED
9.      Realization of the SEPRP, through numerous contacts with international institutions, with the WB at the
first place, with donor-countries and world reputable equipment suppliers, enabled to the employees in EPBiH to
collect new information, and their exchange, on the latest technological development and to be prepared the
marketing economy philosophy as sole condition for profit making.
Finaally, thanks to excellent cooperation with the WB, the PIU EPBiH has acquired additional knowledge and
experiences making it capable for the implementation of the new projects. The results and experience gained
contributed to establish today's and future business, policy of the EPBiH: "all the investments realized within
EI'BiH, out of the WB project, by its own and/or foreign funds, in all stages, and particularly in the procurement,
shall follow applicable WB procedures and regulations", whenever applicable.

A.     PRE-WAR SITUATION
1.     In 1990, Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H) produced 12,613 Gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity from
generating plants located on its territory. Electricity consumption was 11,535 GWh. The system comprised 13
hydropower plants with a total capacity of 2,034 megawatts (MW) and an average output of 6,922 GWh/year, and
12 thermal power plants with a total capacity of 1,957 MW and an output of 9,252 GWh in 1990. The thermal
power plants were brown coal and lignite fired, with the fuel coming from mines within B&H. A single,
republic-wide, vertically integrated utility, Elektroprivreda Bosne i Hercegovine, was responsible for operating the
B&H system and meeting local demand. However, being part of the former Yugoslav network, the 400 kilovolt
(kV) power grid in B&H was controlled by the Yugoslav Electric Power Industry's (JUGEL) dispatching center in
Belgrade. Power exchanges were also controlled by JUGEL.
At the beginning of 1996, more than half of generating capacity had been put out of operation because of
direct damages, destroyed transmission lines or lack of coal. Most plants had also suffered from lack of
maintenance during the war. About 60% of the transmission network and control system in the Federation was
seriously damaged, including transmission facilities and interconnection lines to neighboring countries. The
transmission network and control system in RS were also heavily damaged, particularly in those areas located close
to confrontation lines. The 400 kV system in B&H was almost completely out of operation (the main exception
was the Trebinje-Podgorica 400 kV transmission line). Many distribution networks were badly damaged in both
the Federation and RS as a result of fighting and lack of maintenance. Many transformer stations, buildings,
telecommunications and maintenance facilities and equipment were also either seriously damaged or destroyed.
The pre-war Elektroprivreda Bosne i Hercegovine had split into three utilities, who presently own and operate the
generating plants and high- and low-voltage networks on their service territory: Elektroprivreda Bosne i
Hercegovine (EPB&H) and Elektroprivreda Hrvatske Zajednice Herceg-Bosne (EPHZHB) in the Federation of
Bosnia and Herzegovina (FB&H); and Elektroprivreda Republike Srpske (EPRS) in the Republika Srpska (RS).
B.      PRE-PROJECT SITUATION
2.     War damages to the B&H power system, started in 1991 with destruction of transmission facilities and
interconnection lines to the neighboring countries and UCPTE and thereafter spread, starting in April 1992, to
large parts of the generation, transmission and distribution system causing total damages in a value of US$ 1,340
mill. In various parts of the system, as of the end of 1995:
*   Generation:          Installed capacities in the Federation area were 2,574 MW and
49% of the capacities were damaged or out of operation; or out of operation;
*   Transmission:        Over 60% of the transmission network and communication and
control system was damaged or destroyed;
*   Distribution:        The distribution network of EPHZHB was largely destroyed.
C.     THE PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND EVALUATION
3.     The primary objective was to restore electric power supply at least cost. The project was to help restoring
the generation, transmission and distribution systems to meet at least part of the expected increase in demand
within B&H, reconnect many consumers still without power after the war, and reduce power outages, variations in
voltage level, and other quality of service defects. It was to help minimizing electricity supply costs by focusing on
the most cost-effective investments in the power sector and in the coal mines, reducing losses in generation,
transmission and distribution, and improving power exchange within B&H. Power and coal sector restructuring
actions that are implemented under project helped to minimize electricity supply costs. The key performance
indicators are increases in electricity generation and sales within B&H, and reduction in losses in transmission and
distribution. The project has started on March 31st 1999 and was completed on December 31st 2001.

The secondary objective was to improve cost recovery. The key performance indicators are revenue collection
relative to amounts billed and to cash operating costs of Elektroprivreda B&H, Elektroprivreda HZHB and
Ele.ktroprivreda RS. Respectively and gradual increases in tariff levels.
D.     IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
4.     Within the PE EPHZHB the Project implementation unit PIU was established. It was supported by the
experts from the management and entities for generation, transmission and distribution of the EPHZHB and also
by related departments for the procurement, legal affairs, financing, budgeting, accounting, cost control,
scheduling, technical support, personal support, and by foreign and local consulting companies.
The PIU has completely implemented the IDA financed projects and also the projects administrated by the WB and
the projects financed by the EBRD loan.
The installation of the large equipment in the generation facilities was made by the suppliers with the engagement
of the local companies as subcontractors wherever it was acceptable. The design replacement and installation of
generation, transmission and distribution equipment was performed by appropriate local entities of EPHZHB with
their maintenance personnel having great experience in such works.
The implementation of the grant funds was performed by authorized donors agencies with close cooperation of the
PIIJ in preparation of the technical specifications, evaluation reports, coordination in follow-up, reporting and
project management. In this project too, the installation of the equipment were performed by the EPHZHB's
personnel.
Alli above means that PIU was performing complex planning, coordination, managing and follow-up of all projects
financed by credit and grant funds realized under the Power [I project for the needs of EPHZHB.
For the proposed project, a Federation PIU has been established, with branch units in EPB&H and EPM, and a
separate PIU has been established in EPRS.
E.     OPERATION EXPERIENCE
5.     The part of Project for EPHZHB are realized in the amount of US$ 17.56 millions equivalent, (compared
with appraisal estimate of US$ 24.64 millions equivalent), comprising US$ 2.37 millions equivalent local costs
(compared with appraisal estimate of US$ 4,60 millions equivalent) and US$ 15.18 millions equivalent foreign
costs (compared with appraisal estimate of US$ 20.04 millions equivalent).
The scheduled objectives for each project component are achieved, mostly within the schedules and budget. The
acliievement of the project objectives are summarized as follows:
-      Totally rehabilitated capacities in HPPs are 620 MW: (HPP Rama 2x80 MW; HPP Jajce I 3x10 MW;
HPP Eapljina 2x215 MW).
-      The transmission line in direction Trebinje - Mostar - Jablanica - Jajce - Prijedor was rehabilitated in
the total length of 404.4 km, and from that 143.1 km is part of EPHZHB. (DFID).
-      For 18 substations 220 kV and 110 kV the measurement and telecommunication equipment was procured
and installed.
-      435 km of 35/20/10/0,4kV distribution lines was rehabilitated; three SS 35/20/10 kV and fifty nine
20/10/0.4 SSs were restored and rehabilitated.

F.     BANK PERFORMANCE
6.     Starting with the Reconstruction Project and particularly with preparation of the SEPRP, the performance
of the Bank is apprised as satisfactory:
-      in the project identification
-      in the priority defining
-      in the Projects preparation assistance
-      in all phases of the projects appraisal
-      in the follow-up and supervision of each specific contact and the project as a whole
-      in realization of the leading (coordinating) position with all other donors (co-financiers).
G.     PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER AND BENEFICIARY
7.     The performance of the Government of B&H and the Government of the Federation of B&H was
satisfactory. The Reconstruction and International Assistance Sector of the Council of Ministers and of Ministry of
Foreign Trade and International Relations of B&H has received all available information and received the Project
Progress Reports. The full support was provided by Federal Ministry of Energy, Mining and Industry and by
Federal Prime Minister personally too.
The management of the EPHZHB was giving continuous supports to the Project. Specifically significant
contribution of the EPHZHB's management was in providing EPHZHB own funds for the Project (implementation
including local funds for installation works, procurement of local goods and materials with a total value of US$
2.37 million). This all means that the performance of the Beneficiary and EPHZHB could be considered as
satisfactory.
H.     KEY LESSONS LEARNED
8.     One of the lessons learned from this Project - that many difficulties could arise if the financing is not
covered for the project. The delays in filling up the financial gaps and the delay in the implementation of some
bilateral grants could influence the deadline for the projects completion (December 31, 2001).
Furthermore it was proven that a close cooperation between PIU EPHZHB and implementation agencies of the
donors is essential in order to fully identify priority needs of EP HZHB. This is achievable by the engagement of
local experts.
Also, the strong and well staffed PIU can effectively implement great number of the contract and to perform high
quality cooperation with the WB and other co-financiers. The experience gained with consultants, suppliers and/or
contractors were positive and should be used whenever it is consistent with the economy and effectively
requirements. This is, between others, the positive push to the national economy.
Realization of the SEPRP, through numerous contacts with international institutions, with the WB at the first
place, with donor-countries and world reputable equipment suppliers, enabled to the employees in EP HZHB to
collect new information, and their exchange, on the latest technological development and to be prepared the
marketing economy philosophy as sole condition for profit making.
Finally, thanks to excellent cooperation with the WB, the PIU EPHZHB has acquired additional knowledge and
experiences making it capable for the implementation of the new projects. The results and experience gained
contributed to establish todays and future business policy of the EPHZHB: "all the investments realized within
EPHZHB, out of the WB project, by its own and/or foreign funds, in all stages, and particularly in the procurement,
shall follow applicable WB procedures and regulations", whenever applicable.

A.      PRE-WAR SITUATION
1.     In 1990, Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H) produced 12,613 Gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity from
generating plants located on its territory. Electricity consumption was 11,535 GWh. The system comprised 13
hydropower plants with a total capacity of 2,034 megawatts (MW) and an average output of 6,922 GWh/year, and
12 thermal power plants with a total capacity of 1,957 MW and an output of 9,252 GWh in 1990. The thermal
power plants were brown coal and lignite fired with the fuel coming from mines within B&H. A single,
republic-wide, vertically integrated utility Elektroprivreda Bosne and Hercegovine, was responsible for operating
the B&H system and meeting local demand. However, being part of the former Yugoslav network, the 400 kilovolt
(kV) power grid in B&H was controlled by the Yugoslav Electric Power Industry's (JUGEL) dispatching center in
Belgrade. Power exchanges were also controlled by JUGEL.
At the beginning of 1996, more than half of generating capacity had been put out of operation because of direct
damages, destroyed transmission lines or lack of coal. Most plants had also suffered from lack of maintenance
during the war. About 60% of the transmission network and control system in the federation were seriously
damaged, including transmission facilities and interconnection lines to neighboring countries. The transmission
network and control systems in RS were also heavily damaged, particularly in those areas located close to
confrontation lines. The 400 kV system in B&H was almost completely out of operation (the main exception was
the Trebinje-Podgorica 400 kV transmission line). Many distribution networks were badly damaged in both the
Federation and RS as a result of fighting and lack of maintenance. Many transformer stations, buildings,
telecommunications and maintenance facilities and equipment were also either seriously damaged or destroyed.
The pre-war Elektroprivreda Bosne i Hercegovine had split into three utilities, who presently own and operate the
generating plants and high-and low-voltage networks on their service territory: Elektroprivreda Bosne
Hercegovine(EPB&H) and Elektroprivreda Hrvatske Zajednice Herceg- Bosne (EPHZHB) in the Federation of
Bosnia and Herzegovina(FB&H); and Elektroprivreda Republike Srpske(EPRS) in the Republic of Srpska(RS).
B.     PRE-PROJECT SUTUATION
2.     War-related damage to the power sector has been severe, not only because of destruction but also because
of the lack of maintenance due to shortage of materials, spare parts and manpower.
Despite mentioned difficulties, EPRS managed to carry out the reconstruction and the repair on the part of
transmission and distribution capacities, with its own resources and manpower, supported by international
institutions, which significantly improved the secured supply to the consumers in year 1998.
The electricity generation in 1998 was equal to 4316 GWh, which is 5.8% more than in 1997. Gross electricity
consumption over the same period was 2883.1 GWh, which represents an increase of 8.7 % compared to the
previous year. Gross consumption of RS (net consumption plus transmission losses) amounts to 3021.8 GWh,
which represents an increase of 8.5% compared to the previous year. In 1998, the electricity exchange between
EPRS and FR Yugoslavia, Federation of BiH, Romania and Albania reached 1295.06 GWh.
-      Generation: Installed capacities in the Republic of Srpska were 1309 MW
-      Transmission: A great part of the transmission network and communication and control system was
damaged or destroyed.
-      The distribution network of EPRS was largely destroyed.
C.     THE PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND EVALUATION
3.     The primary objective was to restore electric power supply at least cost. The project was to help restoring
the generation, transmission and distribution systems to meet at least part of the expected increase in demand
within B&H, reconnect many consumers still without power after the war, and reduce power outages, variations in
voltage level, and to improve the other quality of services. It was to help minimizing electricity supply costs by
focusing on the most cost-effective investments in the power sector and in the coal mines, reducing losses in

generation, transmission and distribution, and improving power exchange within B&H. Power and cost sector
restructuring actions that are implemented under project helped to minimize electricity supply costs. The key
peiformance indicators are increases in electricity generation and sales within B&H, and reduction in losses in
transmission and distribution.
The project also included investments to reduce pollution at coal fired power stations. The main indicator is
recluction in dust emissions at the Gacko thermal power station.
The project has started on March 31,1999 and completed on December 31, 2001.
D.     IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
4.     Within the EPRS the Project Implementation Unit was established. It was supported by the experts from
the management and entities from generation, transmission and distribution of the EPRS and also by Canadian
consulting company ACRES. PIU/EPRS supported by ACRES had prepared detailed schedule of supply,
installation and works using the following procurement methods: ICB, LIB and IS.
The PIU has completely implemented the IDA financed projects and also the projects administered by the WB and
the projects financed by EBRD loan.
The installation of the large equipment in the generation facilities was made by the suppliers with the engagement
of the local companies as subcontractors wherever it was acceptable.
The implementation of the grant funds was performed by authorized donors agencies with close cooperation with
the: PIU in preparation of the technical specification, evaluation reports, coordination in follow-up, reporting and
project management. In this projects too, the installation of the equipment was performed by the EPRS personnel.
Al l above means that PIU was performing complex planning, coordination, managing and follow-up of all projects
financed by credit and grants funds realized under the Power 2 project for the needs of EPRS.
E.     OPERATION EXPERIENCE
5.     The part of Project for EPRS are realized in the amount of USD 54.307 millions equivalent (compared
wi th appraisal estimate of USD 79.831 millions equivalent) comprising USD 10.385 millions equivalent local costs
(compared with appraisal estimate of USD 16.040 millions equivalent - this amount includes totally costs planned
for rehabilitation of inter-entities transmission lines) and USD 35.989 millions equivalent foreign costs (compared
with appraisal estimate of USD 50.791 millions equivalent).
The scheduled objectives for each project component are achieved, mostly within the schedules and budget. The
achievement of the project objectives are summarized as follows:
-      Partially rehabilitated capacities in HPPs are 278 MW (HPP Trebinje 1-2x54+1x60 MW; HPP Bocac -
2x55 MW).
-      Partially rehabilitated capacities in TPPs are 300 MW( TPP Gacko -lx300 MW).
The basic results (after implementation of particular components of Project 2 i.e. after reconstruction and
rehabilitation of generating facilities: HPP Bocac, HPP Trebinje 1, TPP Gacko) are reflected in significant
improvement of operation reliability of power system of the Republic of Srpska; reduction of number of outages;
increase of reliability of generating units etc.). Particular results are in environmental area in TPP Gacko:
re(luction of dust emission (six times less than before), environmental protection of ash disposal area towards the
prevention of pollution of subterranean waters.
The 400 kV equipment for transmission lines was procured as follows: OPGW cable in length of 130 km and
AC'SR conductor in length of 130 km that will be mounted in the frame of project Power 111.
- 37 -



In order to establish charge measurements between Power Utilities and on inter-countries connections, SS 220/x
and 1 10/x the measurement and telecommunication equipment was procured and installed.
Reconstruction of SSs 110/x Brcko2, Modrica, Samac and Doboj I were carried out.
Reconstruction of 220 kV transmission line Tuzla -Djakovo as well as 11 OkV TLs Tuzla-Lopare, Srebrenik -Brcko,
Doboj I - Gracanica, Doboj - Maglaj and Brcko -Samac were carried out.
All objectives of rehabilitation of distribution networks that were foreseen in the frame of Project 2 are fulfilled
through funds granted by EU, UK and USAID. Reconstruction had included 35 kV, 20kV and 0.4 kV networks of
areas: Banja Luka, Doboj, Bijeljina, Pale and Trebinje. Realization of the portion of EU program relating to the
reconstruction of 14 substations 20/0.4 kV and connecting transmission lines of Banja Luka area and 15 substation
10/0.4 kV of Bijeljina area is in progress and shall be completed by the end of year 2000. USAID Program was
extended on Brcko area (electrification of 9 villages) for the purpose of return of 20,000 refugees.
Realization of JBIC loan (procurement of mining machinery for coal-mines Gacko and Ugljevik that belong to
TPPs Gacko and Ugljevik) is not completed still. Evaluation phase is in process.
F.      BANK PERFORMANCE
6.     Starting with the Reconstruction Project and particularly with preparation of the SEPRP, the performance
of the Bank is appraised as satisfactory:
-      in the project identification
-      in the priority defining
-      in the Projects preparation assistance
-      in all phases of the projects appraisal
-      in the follow-up and supervision of each specific contract and the project as a whole
-      in realization of the leading (coordinating) position with all other donors (co-financiers).
G.     PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER AND BENEFICIARY
7.     The performance of the Government of B&H was satisfactory. Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Energy
and Mining of the Republic of Srpska have received all available information and received the Project progress
reports. The full support was provided by Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Energy and Mining of the Republic
of Srpska. The management of the EPRS was giving continuos support to the Project. Specifically significant
contribution of the EPRS management was in providing EPRS own funds for the Project (implementation
including local funds for installation works, procurement of local goods and materials with a total value of USD
10.385 millions). This all means that the performance of the Beneficiary and EPRS could be considered as
satisfactory.
H.      KEY LESSONS LEARNED
8.     One of the lessons learned from this Project - how many difficulties could arise if the financing is not
covered for the project. The delays in filling up the financial gaps and the delay in the implementation of some
bilateral grants could influence the deadline for the project completion (December 31, 2001).
Furthermore it was proven that a close cooperation between PIU EPRS and implementation agencies of the donors
is essential in order to fully identify priority needs of EPRS. This is achievable by the engagement of local experts.
Also, the strong and well staffed PIU can effectively implement great number of the contract and to perform high
quality cooperation with the WB and other co-financiers. The experience gained with consultants, suppliers and/or
contractors was positive and should be used whenever it is consistent with the economy and efficiency
requirements. This is, among others, the positive push to the national economy.
