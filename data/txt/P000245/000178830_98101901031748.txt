PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
UPPER VOLTA - SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT (CREDIT 431-UV)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The Second IDA-financed Telecommunications Project in Upper Volta
was designed to rehabilitate and modernize the network and expand local and
long distance facilities in order to improve standards of service and meet
the actual and anticipated demand through 1980. The project objectives also
included institutional improvements within OPT in the areas of tariffs,
budgeting and staff training.
2.        OPT implemented the project without expatriate assistance; physical
execution of the project and credit disbursements have proceeded quite close
to schedule (para. 9.01, 3.10). Eighty percent of the new facilities were
completed five months ahead of schedule (para 3.05). During detailed design
and implementation the scope of the project was revised with IDA agreement
(para. 3.02), increasing the total installed capacity by 46%. In spite of
this change in scope, the total project cost was only about 25% higher than
the appraisal estimates. The principal objective of rehabilitating and
expanding the main local and long distance facilities in order to improve the
quality of service (para 4.01) and meet the anticipated demand has been
largely achieved. The project, complemented with the earth satellite station
and the telex exchange (para. 3.04) opened up this semi-arid landlocked
country to worldwide telecommunications and thus helped it to overcome its
isolation and its major communications problems. The capital city and other
main centers of economic and administrative activities are now linked by a
reliable telecommunications network. The achievements in terms of subscriber
connections are 28% above original targets. This represents a national
average growth rate of 18% per year during the project period, well above the
original forecast of 15% (para. 4.02). The quality of service is relatively
good and among the best of the Western Africa region.
3.        OPT has been able to meet the 6% covanented rate of return during
the period 1974-1978, except for 1975; the rate of return on average net
fixed assets in service fluctuated between a low 2.7% in 1975 and a high
13.8% in 1977 following a 25% tariff increase. However, from 1979 a steep
decline started in the operating results due to a sharp increase in personnel
and depreciation expenses (para. 5.01). The internal financial rate of
return for the project is 16.4% which compares with an appraisal estimate of
20%.
4.        OPT's satisfactory overall performance and technical competence
during project construction was unfortunately not supported by a sound
management of the financial and staff resources toward the end of the project
period. The causes were: (a) considerable turnover in top management
(para. 6.08); (b) an ill-designed and premature reorganization (para. 6.03);
(c) over-recruitment (para. 6.10); and (d) lack of financial discipline
(paras. 5.05-5.07). Strengthening in these major areas is the subject of a
management improvement program included in the third telecommunications
project (Credit 1235-UV).






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      At the time of appraisal of the Second Telecommunications Project
in 1972, public telecommunications in Upper Volta were provided by two
autonomous organizations. The Office des Postes et Telecommunications (OPT),
a public entity wholly owned by the Voltaic Government, provided domestic
telecommunications services. A French company, France Cable et Radio
(FCR)l, operated the main international facilities. In 1978, OPT took over
FCR's operations in Upper Volta and became thus responsible for both domestic
and international telephone, telegraph and telex services. In addition it
provides postal services, and operates a nationwide public checking account
service.
1.02      In February 1969, IDA approved a first credit of US$0.8 million for
telecommunications to Upper Volta (Credit 141-UV) to support an urgently
needed rehabilitation program and a limited expansion of the
telecommunications network. Preparations for the first project started in
1966, during which IDA helped set up OPT as a commercially oriented entity
with legal and financial autonomy. The project was satisfactorily completed
in 1975. The June 1976 performance audit report for the first project
pointed out that, with IDA support, OPT managed to recruit and train
competent executives, reducing its dependence on expatriate services,
established a satisfactory accounting system and became an efficient
organization.
1.03      In June 1973, IDA approved a second credit of US$4.5 million to
Upper Volta (Credit 431-UV) with OPT as the beneficiary to support the
1974-1977 telecommunications development program. Project costs were
estimated to be US$5.6 million, which represented 86% of the program. The
IDA credit of US$4.5 million was to finance 96% of foreign costs, or 80% of
total project costs. The remaining foreign and local costs of the project
and the costs of the remaining part of the program were to be financed by
OPT's internally generated funds. The proceeds of the IDA credit were
on-lent to OPT at 7-1/4% interest for twenty years, including a four-year
grace period.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Preparation, Appraisal and Negotiations
2.01      Project preparation was based on OPT's 1974-1977 development
program which was drawn up from a selection of project items prepared with
the assistance of an expert from the International Telecommunications Union
(ITU) in 1970-1971. During the 1972 annual meetings the request from
Government for the second telecommunications project was made. The project
was appraised in December 1972. Negotiations between IDA and the Government
of Upper Volta were concluded in May 1973, and the credit was approved by
IDA's Board of Directors on June 21, 1973.

Project Objectives
2.02      The project aimed at replacing worn out and obsolete equipment and
rehabilitating and expanding the main local and long distance facilities in
order to improve the quality of service and meet the actual and anticipated
demand for subscriber connections through 1980. In addition, the project
aimed at providing assistance to OPT for reviewing tariffs and improving
budget procedures and staff training.
Project Description
2.03      The project consisted of the following items:
(i) supply and installation of automatic switching equipment
for about 4,800 exchange lines in Ouagadougou, the
capital city and in four provincial towns;
(ii)  extension of local cable network and subscriber plant in
the five above locations;
(iii) construction of transmission links between Ouagadougou
and Koudougou and between Bobo Dioulasso and Banfora;
(iv)  supply and installation of trunk switching equipment in
the national and international transit exchange in
Ouagadougou and in four small local telephone exchanges;
(v) reconstruction of about 800 km of existing long distance
overhead lines and construction of about 400 km of new
routes between regional centers and communities;
(vi)  construction of new buildings at Ouagadougou, Banfora and
Fada N'Gourma;
(vii) supply and installation of power plant in the Ouagadougou
technical building, vehicles, miscellaneous technical
equipment and materials;

2.06      These covenants were designed to strengthen the financial position
of OP'T and improve its management.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-up
3.01      Approved in June 1973, the Credit Agreement was signed in September
1973, but the credit became effective only as from May 23, 1974 because of
delays experienced in obtaining ratification and in entering into the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement. Project implementation started immediately after
project appraisal with the preparation of detailed design and bidding
documents for the main items.
Project Revision
3.02      During the detailed design and implementation of the project, OPT
made--with IDA's approval--the following changes in the project:
(i)  1,000 additional lines of new local switching equipment
were added to the new Ouagadougou telephone exchange
instead of providing interface equipment for the existing
when, following comparison between prices of the new
equipment and quotation from the supplier of the existing
equipment, it appeared that this was the least cost
solution;
(ii)  1,200 additional lines of new local switching equipment
and 60 lines of national trunk switching equipment were
procured for Bobo Dioulasso (at the same unit prices as



- 6 -
obtained under ICB) when it appeared that tlhe supplier of
the existing Bobo Dioulasso exchange would not provide
the necessary extensions, interface and adaptations to
increase a limited traffic capacity and introduce
subscriber trunk dialing;
(iii)  a separate international automatic transit exchange for
regional and overseas telephone service was installed
instead of combined national and international transit
exchange as foreseen at appraisal (see paragraph 3.03);
(iv)  alternative designs were adapted for the two transmission
links Ouagadougou-Koudougou and Bobo Dioulasso-Banfora,
using part of the facilities of the existing backbone
microwave link when these designs were found to be more
economical on the basis of comparing the costs for the
independent scheme as appraised with price quotations
obtained from the supplier of the existing links; and
(v) the program of long distance overhead line construction
was reduced in half, from 1,200 km to 657 km (see Annex
1, page 2),when it appeared that OPT would not be able to
construct the whole program during the project period.
3.03      Regarding item (iii) above, the solution of a combined national and
international transit exchange was advocated ELs least cost solution by IDA
who advised OPT to include it as alternative in the bidding documents. OPT
objected on the ground that a larger demand of international traffic was
expected and that the new exchange building already under construction could
not accommodate a combined trunk exchange and IDA finally accepted (paragraph
7.04). Although the two transmission routes, as mentioned in point (iv)
above, were appraised as independent systems, the designs adopted were
already mentioned as possible alternatives in the appraisal report if found
to be the least cost solution. The overhead :Line routes which were dropped
from the IDA project were constructed later under Dutch bilateral assistance
grant. This additional cost of local and long distance switching equipment
of items (i) to (iii) above were financed substantially from savings made

Revision of the Program
3.04      In May 1975, the Government of Upper Volta approached the
Association for the financing of a Standard B earth satellite station and a
telex exchange. IDA funds being not available OPT reached an agreement with
a US bank consortium led by Eximbank for the financing of this project
which started in 1976 and was successfully completed in 1978. IDA was
consulted on this additional investment in compliance with Section 4.07 of
the Project although late, and gave its agreement in March 1977 after



- 7 -
reviewing its justification, financing plan, and OPT's revised financial
projections for the end of the program period. Commissioning of the
satellite earth station in 1978 became the main justification for OPT to take
over responsibility for international telecommunications (paragraph 1.01).
Implementation Schedule
3.05      The project was originally scheduled to be completed by June 30,
1977. At the time of credit negotiations, 80% of the project bidding
documents were already prepared and approved by IDA. In November 1976, i.e.,
five months ahead of schedule, 7,000 lines of new local switching equipment
and domestic trunk switching equipment, two microwave spur routes and
overhead carrier equipment were commissioned, enabling subscriber trunk
dialing to be included between the major cities. This represented about 80%
of the revised project. Due to delays in installation and testing, the
international transit exchange was commissioned in August 1978 and the
project fully completed by December 1978 with the installation by OPT's staff
of the last long distance overhead lines of the reduced program.
Reporting
3.06      Only two progress reports were forwarded to IDA both in 1975; they
partly met the reporting requirements. However, supervision missions
obtained in the field the missing information necessary to monitor the
project's physical progress. Financial statements and audit reports were
sent to IDA or made available to supervision missions but with delays which
exceeded, at times, eight to twelve months the covenanted schedule (Section
4.03).
Procurement
3.07      OPT followed the Bank's guidelines for procurement, and did not
encounter any difficulties in procurement of equipment.
Cost of the Project
3.08      Estimated costs at the time of appraisal and actual costs are
summaLrized below:

The actual project costs include the changes in quantities of equipment as
dLescribed under paragraph 3.02. The 133% cost increase for the telephone
switching component was due to: (i) procurement of a separate international
transit exchange (cost US$430,000); (ii) a 50% increase in quantities for
local and trunk switching equipment; and (iii) an 11% increase in unit price
compared to appraisal estimates (US$232 equivalent per line, compared to
UJS$208 including price contingencies). The alternative design of the two
transmission links (paras. 3.02 and 3.03) resulted in US$500,000 cost saving,
and the reduction of the overhead line program made an additional amount of
US$600,000 available to compensate for the increase in telephone switching
equipment. The actual unit cost per kilometer of long distance overhead line
of about US$1,050 was in line with the estimated cost, including price
contingencies. The largest unexpected cost overrun occured in the exchange
building construction financed by OPT's own resources where the actual costs
were five times the original estimates. The cost overrun has been partly
caused by the 1974 inflation wave, shortage of cement in Western Africa, and
the resulting substantial price increases. On the other hand, to enable
larger extensions of equipment in the future, buildings larger than
anticipated at appraisal were designed. The unexpected development of demand
at the end of the project (paragraph 4.02) proved that OPT made a wise
decision. For Banfora and Fada N'Gourma the new buildings are common to Post
and Telecommunications services and 50% of the building costs have been
charged to the project.
:3.09     Compared to telecommunications projects in other Western African
countries, OPT obtained relatively fair prices for the equipment and material
procured under ICB. This was partly due to the fact that the main contracts
were signed before the 1974 inflation wave. The prices were nevertheless
above the world prices of equipment procured during the same period; they
also reflect the small size of the contracts which do not attract large



international competition and higher cost for equipment installation under
conditions of scarcity of technical skills necessitating employment of
technicians from abroad.
Disbursements
3.10      The estimated and actual disbursements of the IDA credit were as
follows:

FY76           1,800           864            48%
FY77           3,500         3,267            93%
FY78           4,500         4,226            94%
FY79             -           4,490            99%
FY80             -           4,500           100%
Initial disbursement started immediately after credit effectiveness in May
1974. Once the contracts for IDA financed goods and services were finalized
and signed, OPT sent to IDA, without substantial delay, applications for
payments directly to the suppliers. Final disbursements were made on
October 31, 1979. On June 30, 1978, the expected date for final disbursement
as per appraisal, 94% of the credit was disbursed.
Credit Allocations
3.11      The original and final allocations of the credit proceeds were as
follows:



- 10 -

Total                     4,500,000.00   4,500,000.00
The final allocation reflects the project revision as described in paragraph
3.02. Lower expenses for consulting services are due to employment of ITU
experts financed by UNDP (paragraph 3.11). Credit allocations for training
were not utilized as they were provided by French and Swiss technical
assistance under respective Government financing.
Operations
3.12      The equipment was supplied in accordance with specifications and
its performance has met the specified requirements. OPT is satisfied with
the quality and efficiency of plant obtained through contractors. Operation
continues to be satisfactory.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors, Suppliers and Beneficiary
3.13      The Project Agreement required the employment of engineering
consultants (Section 2.02). For the preparation of bidding documents and
evaluation of bids, OPT was assisted by ITU/UNDP experts. Engineering
consultants (SOFRECOM, Paris) were employed for the factory tests of
equipment and local supervision and quality test of equipment and plant. The
Performance of ITU/UNDP experts and engineering consultants was satisfactory.
3.14      The suppliers and contractors performed according to their
contractual obligations.
3.15      OPT's overall performance and controL of project execution, as well
as technical and managerial competence during construction, installation and
commissioning of new equipment and plant were satisfactory. Annex 1 compares
the actual physical achievements with appraisal, and Annex 2 compares
appraisal targets with actual project data. Although IDA was initially
somewhat reluctant, OPT was right in insisting on a program and project
revisions (paragraphs 3.02 and 3.03) which helped to better cope with
demand.



- 11 -
Neverth,eless, because of a lack of skilled technicians, OPT did not extend
the urban cable networks in the two main cities, as needed, and thus connect
more waiting subscribers to the existing switching capacity. This explains
the low exchange fill (44%) although the waiting list, as a percentage of
demand, is still substantial. The third telecommunications project under
preparation is designed to correct this unbalance.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01      Commissioning the new local and long distance facilities under the
project in November 1976 resulted in a substantial improvement of telephone
service. Delays in obtaining dial tone have virtually disappeared and long
distance connections are clearer and obtained without delay due to the
introduction of subscriber trunk dialing between the centers served by the
new telecommunications facilities. Traffic samples made during the months
before and after the introduction of subscriber trunk dialing on the main
trunk route between Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso showed a substantial
traffic increase of 177%. This, in particular, demonstrates the hidden
traffic potential which surfaces as soon as the quality of service improves.
4.02      The number of connected lines in operation by December 31,
1979(5,368) was 34% above the appraisal target of 4,000. At the completion
date of the physical program (December 31, 1978), the number of connected
lines was 4,586, or 28% above appraisal target. This represents a national
average growth rate of 18% per year during the project implementation period
(1972-1979), compared with the original forecast of 15% annual increase.
4.03      OPT's telecommunications operating revenues have steadily increased
at an average annual growth of 18% from CFAF 618 million in 1974 to CFAF 876
million in 1976; then, following the commissioning of the major project
componenats in 1976 and a 25% tariff increase in May 1977 they jumped to a 40%
annual growth between 1976 and 1979 to reach CFAF 2,400 million in
1979. Without a tariff increase, the operating revenues would have grown at
an average annual rate of 30% from 1976 to 1979. This compares with the
average annual growth of 12% estimated at appraisal time.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Financial Results
5.01      The financial performance of OPT's Telecommunications operation
over the period 1974-1979 has been mixed but, on the whole, results have been
adequate. The rate of return on average net fixed assets in service
fluctuated between a low of 2.7% in 1975 and a high of 13.8% in 1977 (tariffs
were increased by an average of 25% in May 1977). OPT has complied with the



- 12 -
revenue covenant under Credit 431-UV during the period 1974-1978, except in
1975. This covenant called for a rate of return on the current value of
average net fixed assets in service of 6% during the period 1974-1978 and 8%
in 1979 and thereafter. However, in 1979 a steep decline started in the
operating results due to a sharp increase in personnel and depreciation
expenses. The rate of return on the book value of average net fixed assets
in operation in 1979 was 5.7%. Comparisons of the forecast and actual
fiLnancial statements of the Telecommunications branch are shown in Annexes 3,
4 and 5.
5.02      The reliability of the year-to-year results is reduced somewhat by
the accounting department's improper application of accrual and inventory
accounting concepts. This matter has received considerable attention in
recent supervision missions and substantial progress has been made with PPF
financed technical assistance in connection with a proposed third
telecommunications project.

project period is shown below. Detailed annual funds flow statements are

** PCAS: Postal Checking Account System
5.04      During the six-year project period OPT's total applications
amounted to US$29 million, as compared to an appraisal forecast of US$7.5
million. Net internal cash generation provided 29% of the sources of funds
(40%); borrowings 63% (60%); and grants 8% (0%). Thus, OPT's own
contribution to invesments was less favorable than forecast which was due to
a 300% increase in investments (US$27.0 million versus US$6.0 million)
(paragraph 5.08).



- 14 -
Financial Covenants
5.05      Borrowings as a percentage of total applications did not vary
significantly as compared to the appraisal forecast. However, about 50% of
the borrowings were funds taken from the postal checking account system
(PCAS) (paragraph 5.06). These borrowings were originally intended to be
short-term and should, under the terms of the EProject Agreement, have been
limited to a maximum of two months of operating expenses. However, OPT came
to depend more and more on these funds. Thus, OPT did not comply with the
s'hort-term debt limitation covenant (Section 4.08.c).  It complied with the
long-term debt covenant, primarily because it did not incur the debt it would
have had to incur were it not for the availability of PCAS funds.  IDA
frequently advised both OPT and the Government of the danger inherent in this
course of action but was not successful in haviLng OPT and the Government take
corrective action. This can be explained partially by the fact that accurate
financial data were not available at the time and that, therefore, the extent
of the use of postal checking accounts funds was underestimated.
5.06      During the project period, deposits in the PCAS by the public and
private sectors increased from CFAF 1.1 billion in 1974 to CFAF 6.2 billion
in 1979 (US$25.0 million equivalent). Despite repeated IDA request to stop
the usage of PCAS funds (paragraph 5.05) OPT utilized through the end of 1980
about CFAF 4.6 billion (US$18.4 million) in PCAS funds of which about CFAF
2.6 billion for the Telecommunications branch and the remainder for the
Postal branch, which assumed the character of an interest free long-term debt
without repayment schedule. Apart from the threat that this usage
constitutes to the soundness of the PCAS itself, the easy availability of
free funds has been a major factor in the relaxation of financial discipline
within OPT.
5.07      During the period 1974-1979, the Postal branch had a negative net
cash flow in each year except in 1975. Net cash flow decreased from minus
CFAF 19 million in 1974 to minus CFAF 262 million in 1979. In accordance
with the Project Agreement, these deficits were not compensated for by
transfer of funds from the Telecommunications branch. However, neither did
the Government provide subsidies as it should have done on the basis of
Section 3.02 (a) of the Credit Agreement. Instead, the Postal branch, like
the Telecommunications branch, used Government funds deposited with the PCAS
(paragraph 5.06).
5.08      With the exception of the satellite earth station, the telex
exchange (see paragraph 3.04) and the microwave link to Togo financed by
CCCE, no prior IDA approval on a financing plan was sought for the other
additional investments whose capital expenditures exceeded US$200,000 per
year (Section 4.07 of Project Agreement).
5.09      For the review of the telecommunications tariff level and structure
OPT should have appointed specialists (Section 2.03). Instead, a tariff
study was carried out by the staff of OPT and IDA accepted this arrangement



- 15 -
as well as the tariff study and its recommendations. The tariff structure in
Upper Volta is similar to that of other francophone countries and was
generally acceptable during the project period. Tariffs were increased by an
average of 25% in May 1977, following an IDA recommendation to the Government
to increase tariffs by 30% as well as to provide equity contributions and
other mieasures to increase OPT's cash flow. The latter proposals were not
accepted by the Government and this has contributed to the increased
utilization of postal checking account funds by OPT (paragraph 5.06). Upper
Volta's telecommunications tariffs are presently among the highest in the
world.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
Management and Organizational Effectiveness
6.01      From its creation in 1968 until 1976, OPT was a relatively
efficient and successful organization; OPT managed to recruit and train
competent technicians, thereby reducing its dependence on expatriate
services. As a result OPT has been able to technically execute the second
project on schedule, without major implementation problems and is now
providing one of the best domestic telecommunications services of the Western
Africa region. The principal internal factors which have contributed to a
successful performance during the first eight years of OPT's existence were
an outstanding personal leadership and continuity in senior management.
OPT's first general manager was competent and much respected by his staff, he
created and motivated a dedicated management team. He left OPT in 1977.
6.02      Unfortunately, between 1977 and 1980 the main issues facing OPT
have been excessive political pressure on management. This contributed to a
premature reorganization (paragraph 6.03), heavy overstaffing (paragraph
6.10), inadequate and lax financial management, and a deteriorating financial
position (paragraphs 5.05-5.07). Morale and motivation of previously
effective senior executives decreased leading to low standards of efficiency
and discipline.
6.03      OPT was reorganized by Decree of August 29, 1977.  This
reorganization was ill-designed and facilitated an inflation of senior
positions and unnecessary staff increases. It was made against IDA's
explicit advice. Among the problems were: too many subordinates (13)
reported directly to the Director General and no particular responsibilities
were assigned to the Deputy Director General. This poor organizational
structure increased the Director General's workload and contributed to
coordination and management problems. Moreover, a creation of five Regional
P&T Directorates was premature, given the limited level of activity in most
of these areas and generated its own recruiting pressure on the already
excessive number of OPT staff (paragraph 6.08).



- 16 -
6.04     OPT established a satisfactory accounting system and introduced
separation of accounts between the Telecommunications branch and the Postal
branch under the first project (Credit 141-UV). However, adherence to
established accounting procedures declined considerably starting in 1975
following the departure of the expatriate Chiei- Accountant. As a result, the
accounts for the years 1975 through 1978 could not be certified, principally
because of the misapplication of accrual and inventory accounting
procedures. The advice conta'rned in the external audit reports, formal
technical assistance financed under the Bank PPF in connection with the
proposed third project, and increasing awareness by OPT's management of the
importance of good financial reporting have recently resulted in
certification of OPT's 1979 accounts. General:Ly, during the project period
there have been long delays in OPT closing its books at the end of each
fiscal year and thus in the preparation of.financial statements and external
audit reports. With continued technical assistance, including staff
training, and renewed emphasis by OPT's managemaent on the importance of
accurate and timely financial reporting, it should be entirely feasible to
obtain certified accounts within the six months time period covenanted under
Section 4.03 of the Project Agreement.
6.05      Under the second project, OPT instituted satisfactory budgeting
procedures, providing for separate budgets for telecommunications and postal
cperations. In its implementation of the budget, however, OPT has gradually
assumed more the character of a Government agen,cy than that of an autonomous
public enterprise with a commercial character. This fact has also
contributed to the tardiness of financial reporting (paragraph 6.04).
6.06      Commercial insurance was considered for the main exchange in
Ouagadougou, but the cost of this sort of insurance was found to be
prohibitive. For this reason and in view of the limited risks, it is assumed
that the Government would provide the funds to replace damaged major assets,
since OPT is a public enterprise. This is the policy in many other countries
and is an acceptable practice.
6.07      Although there were ups and downs during the project period, the
bi-monthly billing system has generally worked quite well. Collections from
the private sector have been satisfactory. Collections from the
"semi-official" sector (embassies and international organizations) have been
somewhat less satisfactory but not unacceptably so. However, collections
from Government have been a major and continuing problem. As a result of
'IDA's repeated representations to Government, the latter settled in 1979 all
arrears through 1978 and increased its budget allocation for
telecommunications to about 85% of actual usage. Since then, arrears have
again been allowed to accumulate to a level equivalent to 14 months of
billing (end of 1980). These will need to be substantially settled as a
condition of the proposed third telecommunications project. It is expected
that internal measures taken by Government and the introduction of central
automatic message accounting equipment under the proposed third project will
provide better control of Government's telecommunications usage, particularly
with regard to international calls.



- 17 -
Staff Recruitment, Training and Development
6.03      Since 1977, there was a considerable turnover in top personnel
(Deputy Director General, Director of Telecommunications, Director of
Planning). This, combined with the 1977 reorganization, disrupted OPT's
efficient management team. Another competent and dedicated senior executive
left OPT in 1979. Contrary to the provisions of the Project Agreement, IDA
was generally not consulted about changes in OPT's top personnel; experience
with this kind of covenant in Upper Volta as elsewhere indicates that it is
difficult to enforce because the Borrower considers it too much of an
intesrference in its internal affairs and IDA is, for the same reason,
hes:Ltant to insist too much on a priori consultation.
,6.09     OPT has not paid sufficient attention to the need to recruit and
appoint qualified accounting staff at all levels and has not instituted
adequate training policies as required under Section 3.01 (a) of the Project
Agreement. Since 1977 salary and promotion policies have not been used
selectively to encourage initiative and professional development among the
relatively few qualified staff members.
6.10      Instead of upgrading the quality of existing staff, OPT has,
particularly since 1977, given priority to recruitment of additional staff.
This over-recruitment has resulted in crowded facilities and low staff morale
and productivity. Total staff increased from 696 in 1974 to 1,644 in 1979,
of which 937 for Telecommunications (including 50% of the common services
staff of 444). For the Telecommunications branch, this works out to a 1979
figure of 175 staff per 1,000 DEL's in service, which is very high. The
Postal branch is similarly overstaffed. Only heightened awareness by OPT's
manaLgement that staff quantity is no substitute for quality and an agreement
to freeze the total number of staff for a period of time, will gradually act
to restore staff morale and productivity and improve operating results. Some
progress has been made in this field in 1980, during which year total staff
remained virtually constant and telecommunications staff per 1,000 DEL's
decreased from 175 in 1979 to 153 in 1980 as a result of the increase in the
number of DEL's in service.
Expatriates, Management Consultants
6.11      Since the departure, in October 1975, of the expatriate in charge
of the accounting department, OPT relies entirely on local staff for
manaLgement and operations.
6.12      OPT did not employ management consultants during the project
period. However, the continuity of the staff of the external auditing firm
(Societe de Controle Fiduciaire) throughout this period has been of
substantial benefit to OPT (paragraph 6.04).

VII. PROJECT JUSTIF:[CATION
Project Achievements
7.01      The principal objective of rehabilitating and expanding the main
local and long distance facilities in order to improve the quality of service
and meet the anticipated demand has been largely achieved. The project,
complemented with the earth satellite station and the telex exchange
(paragraph 3.04) opened up this semi-arid landllocked country to worldwide
telecommunications and thus helped it to overcome its isolation and its major
communications problems. The capital city and other main centers of economic
and administrative activities are now linked lby a reliable telecommunications
network. The achievements in terms of subscriber cornections, traffic and
revenue increases, are far above original targets. The quality of service is
relatively good and among the best of the Western Africa region. A backbone
telecommunications infrastructure has been put in place, so that relatively
smaller incremental investments will be able to support further network
expansion.
7.02      Upper Volta's telecommunications tariffs are still among the
highest in the world; in 1980 local calls were billed at about US$0.22
equivalent. However, from project appraisal in 1972 to project completion in
1979, the annual rate of inflation in Upper Volta averaged 12%, for a
cummulative total of 147% during the seven year period. During the same
period, the tariffs have been increased only once by 25% in 1977 which means
that, expressed in constant 1972 local currency, the tariffs in force in 1979
were 43.5% below those in force in 1972. On the other hand, taking into
account the economies of scale obtained with the telecommunications network
existing after project completion, a better result could certainly have been
achieved if OPT had increased staff productivity. Unfortunately, this
objective was too ambitious, given the cultural and political environment
(paragraph 6.10).
Project Spin-Off
7.03      The construction of long-distance overhead lines in the rural
areas, and the construction of technical buildings and civil works for the
expansion of the local networks in the project provided local employment.
OPT reported that peasants hired for the construction of telephone lines were
particularly proud to be associated to a project which would break their
isolation and they organized themselves voluntarily :Ln order to protect the
telephone line linking them to the rest of the country against depredation.
The project had no negative environmental effect.
Least Cost Solution
7.04      Dimensioning of technical facilities and plant, as well as planning
and timing of their installation and construction play an important role in
telecommunications during the selection process of tlhe least cost solution,



- 19 -
which will finally affect the actual design of each particular project
component. On the other hand, dimensioning, planning and timing have to be
made on the basis of the expected demand whose forecasting is always
hazardous in areas where little or no service exists in the early stages of
economic development. At appraisal and during the early stages of project
implementation, IDA missions were conservative in appreciating the future
demand and thus were in favor of lower cost solutions, such as routing the
whole international traffic through Abidjan and combining the national and
international transit switching facilities (see paragraph 3.02). However,
OPT insisted on planning for a higher level of demand and a revision of the
project which encompassed technical solutions appropriate to it (paragraph
3.03). IDA was finally supportive and the substantial increase of traffic
and subscriber connections experienced at project completion (Chapter IV)
demonstrated that OPT made the right decision. The solution finally selected
for the Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso telephone exchanges (paragraph 3.02.i
and ii) appears to have been the least cost possible solutions, taking into
account the constraints imposed by the foreign supplier of existing
equipment.
Internal Rate of Return
7.05      The internal financial rate of return for the project has been
estimated at 16.4% which compares with an appraisal estimate of 20%. The
lower rate of return on investment is due to the inclusion of additional
lower revenue earning network facilities in the program as against a high
concentration of very profitable facilities in the project. Details of the
internal financial rate of return calculation are given in Annex 6. However,
the economic rate of return should be considerably higher than 16.4% since:
(a) no increase in incremental revenues due to project
components have been considered as from FY80 onwards
despite existing spare capacity on certain facilities
installed under the 1974-1979 program;
(b) no indirect external benefits such as increased
efficiency and better administration in other sectors
(transport, health, agricultural, public service, etc.)
from expanded and improved telecommunications service
have been included; and
(c) no increase in consumer surplus has been considered
despite a significant increase in waiting lists.
VIII. IDA PERFORMANCE
8.01      In general, IDA's role and performance appear to have been
satisfactory. IDA has given valuable advice and support in project
preparation and implementation, pricing of equipment and plant, as well as
procurement of goods under ICB. IDA was supportive in adjusting to the



- 20 -
revision of the project and the program, to cost increases and to alternative
technical solutions. IDA pursued the questions of budgeting and accounting
procedures and auditing arrangements and these efforts are beginning to bear
fruit. However, IDA was less successful in the areas of OPT's organization,
staffing and financial discipline. In this respect, institutional
improvements have not met expectations, possibly because in retrospect they
were too ambitious given changes in the political environment. Further IDA
involvement in the sector should concentrate more on organization,
(financial) management, maintenance and training problems.
Supervision
8.02      Five supervision missions were adequate to monitor physical project
implementation since the same engineer appraised, supervised and completed
the project. However, more staff resources should have been devoted to the
other aspects. No less than five financial analysts were consecutively
involved in the appraisal and supervision stages and this high Bank staff
turnover and the inadequacy of OPT's financial reporting complicated the
supervision of OPT's financial performance and compliance with financial
covenants.
Working Relationship
8.03      The working relationship between IDA, the Government and OPT has
always been excellent.
Covenants
8.04      A statement spelling out the compliLance with covenants is contained
in Annex 7.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01      On balance, the project has been successful.  OPT implemented the
project without expatriate assistance and technical execution has proceeded
quite close to schedule. The number of subscriber lines connected to the
system and the increase of domestic long distance as well as international
traffic have largely exceeded original agreed targets. The level of service
is relatively good and among the best of the Western Africa region. However,
attempts made during the second phase of the project to keep the sector
organization in line with the network expansion were less successful,
resulting in management problems. Although many of the problems were caused
by the political environment prevailing in the country at the time, it is
likely that an early decision by IDA to support the third telecommunicatons
project (paragraph 3.04), as requested by the Government in 1975, would have
given, at the right time, the necessary incentives to better adjust the
sector institutions, its staff requirements and management to the size and
complexity of the network they operate, as well as to the needs of the
society they serve.

CREDIT 431-UV
Return on Investment
Benefit Period
1.    The second project financed under Credit 431-UV extended over the
period 1974-1979. The internal rate of return has been calculated on
the basis of the project cost, plus the cost of the earth satellite station
because the latter is an integral part of the network and enchances its full
utilization. The period of net benefits of the program is assumed to extend
from FY74 to FY95, which corresponds to the assumed mean life of 20 years of
the various items of plant making up the program.
Expenditures and Benefits
2.    All costs and benefits have been adjusted to reflect 1974 values.
Taxes and custom duties have been excluded. Fifty percent of operating costs
and 80% of operating benefits have been imputed to the project, which is
conservative.
Net Benefits
3.    A summary of the cost and benefits streams in CFAF million is as
follows:
Incremental
