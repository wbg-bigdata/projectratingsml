INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC
OF UPPER VOLTA FOR A
SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Upper Volta for the equivalent of
US$4.5 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for tele-
communications development.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The economy of Upper Volta is dealt with in paragraphs 2 to 13
of the President's Report of the same date on a proposed development credit
to the Republic of Upper Volta for am Education Project (Report No. P-1234 a-UV7
A country data sheet and a sheet on foreign aid disbursements are attached as
Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATICNS IN UPPER VOLTA
3.        The proposed credit would be IDA's sixth operation in Upper Volta.
It would bring the total of IDA funds conmitted to US$19.3 million equivalent.
Bank Group lending to Upper Volta has been reviewed in paragraphs lb to 18 of
the President's Report of the same date on the proposed Education Project.
Annex II contains a summary statement on the status of Bank Group lending in
Upper Volta as of May 31, 1973.
PART III - THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background
4.        Under the former Federation of French West Africa, Upper Volta's
telecommunications were operated as a government service under the authority
of the High Commissioner of French West Africa and the governors of the various
territories. After dissolution in 1959 of the West Africa Posts and Tele-
communications Office, postal and telecommnications services in Upper Volta
were incorporated into the general services of the Government, with operations
and development being the responsibility of the Ministry of Posts, Telecommuni-
cations and Information, and finances and accounting forming part of the national
budget under the Ministry of Finance. Under this arrangement operations and
development suffered from lack of funds.



- 2 -
Following the recommendations of a French Government senior adviser
and with the support of IDA, a new autonomous entity, Office des Postes et
Te~communi.cations (OPT), was created on January 1, 1969; soon thereafter, in
Febru,cary 1969 the first credit for telecommunications (US$0.8 million) was made
to Upper Volta to assist OPT's urgently needed rehabilitation and expansion
work. OPT took over responsibility for the domestic and regional telecommunica-
tifJBs ser-aces in addition to postal services and a nationwide public checking
account service8 Tne main international telecommunications facilities continued
with .France Cable et. Radio (FOR), which has a 25-year concession signed with the
Governaent in 1962. With the exception of the military, civi1 aviation and the
rai2'-ay which, as usual in most countries, have their own telecommunications
networks, OFT provides a1l domestic telephone, telegraph and telex services
in Unper Volta and regional connections to Mali, Niger and Ivory Coast.
0.        Policy direction is vested in a 13-member Board of Directors under
thse chairmanship of the Minister of Posts and Telecommnnications. The other
members are appoted by the Government and represent the various Ministries,
the National Assembly, the Economic Council, the Chamber of Commerce and OPT's
staff G
7.        The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is the licensing authority
Por the teleconmmunications sector but control is exercised mainly through minis-
terial representation on OPT's Board of Directors.   Investment in the sector is
coordinated within the plan for national econoric development by the Ministry
of the Plan, industry and Nines,
8.        WItbh only 3,850 telephone stations of all kinds at the end of 1972,
TUpper Volta has one of the lowest telephone densities in Africa: 0.08 per 100
population, Over half of these telephones are in government offices; the rest
are mostly subscribed by businesses, internatione1 organizations, embassies and
other institutionsa Due to lack of adequate facilities both the local and long
distance services are extremely poor, transmission quality is low and fault rates
are high. Howrever, with the ongoing rehabilitation and expansion of the local
distribution networks in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso under the first IDA project
andX with the microave link to the Ivory Coast border under French bilateral assist-
anee, significant improvement in and between these centers is expected in the near
futire. There have been delays in completing the IDA-financed project due to
problems in organizing and. staffing the new entity and in obtaining key expa-
triate advisers tc assist management.  The project is now progressing satisfac-
torily and is expected to be completed in November 1973.
°),       OPT's telecommmnications tariffs are Very high ccupared with other
deve1loping countries offering similar services. To a large extent this is due
to the high costs of maintaining an extensive local and long distance network
.ith relatively pew subscribers. Despite the inadequate service offered yearly
revenue per subscriber is among the highest in the world (about US$650).
I.;>     Upper Volta has presently only two local automatic exchanges, one
in ouagadougou and the other in Bobo-Dioulasso, totalling 1,800 lines.  In
.oe provinces, local service i.s provided through 26 manual switchboards with



- 3 -
a total capacity of 640 lines. Outside plant in the provinces is inadequate
and requires rehabilitation in many areas.
11.       The domestic long distance service consists of about 4,000 km of
copper and iron overhead lines supplemented with carrier equipment on the
main routes. About 600 km of these routes are obsolete and need reconditioning
to avoid breakdown of service. The large capacity microwave link under cons-
truction between Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso and the Ivory Coast border is
expected to be brought into service in early 1974.
12.       Domestic telegraph facilities are available in all towns which have
telephone service. A 100-line automatic telex exchange is operated in
Ouagadougou by FCR and is used mainly for international service.
13.       OPT's subscribers have access through local facilities to international
telephone, telegraph and telex services provided by FOR through HF links to
Paris, Accra, Conakry, Cotonou, Dakar, Lome and M4oscow and through other HF links
provided by OPT, to capitals of neighbouring countries.
Prospects and Objectives
14.       Even after completion of ongoing works being carried out under the
first credit, the quality of service offered to the public will need to be
improved considerably. The first step is to rehabilitate the existing network
and to replace worn-out equipment, to meet the pending demand for telephone
connections to local exchanges and to improve the quality of speech and speed
of connection of lang distance calls. Much of this will be achieved by the
proposed project.
15.       In addition,the present telecommunications tariffs should be reduced,
particularly those for local service and for manual subscribers, in order to
extend the benefits of telephone service to more small businesses, thereby
assisting them in increasing their contribution to the economy. A tariff re-
view will be carried out by OPT and completed by June 30, 1975. Its conclusions
will be discussed and agreed with the Association prior to their implementation.
In view of OPT s limited financial resources any reduction in tariffs should
be done gradually to ensure that possible decreases in revenue arising from
tariff reductions do not exceed the cushion provided for this purpose in OPT's
financial plan.
PART IV - THE PROGRALM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
16.       OPT's 1974-77 telecommunications expansion program aims at rehabili-
tating, modernizing and expanding the local and long distance facilities in
order to improve the quality of service and meet anticipated demand through
1980. The program was prepared by OPT with the assistance of an International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) expert and is compatible with OPT's technical



- 4 -
and financial resources. The total cost of the program is estimated at
US$6.5 million equivalent, out of which US$4.7 million would be in foreign
exchange. Besides the project proposed for IDA financing and described
below, the program includes a 100-line automatic telex exchange in Bobo-
Dioulasso and some other minor construction works.
17.       OPT's total capital investment and working capital requirements
for telecommunications during the 1974-77 period and the sources from
which these requirements will be met are as follows:

The Project
18.       The proposed second project would provide equipment, riaterial and
ancillary construction and services to improve both local and long distance
telephone services in the country.   Specifically the project would consist of:
(i) automatic switching equipment for 4,300 exchange lines at.
the following locations:
Ouagadougou              4,000
Banfora                    200
Fada N'Gourma               200
Koudougou                  200
Ouahigouya                  200
Total         4,800
1,000 of the lines for Ouagadougou will replace inadeouate
switching equipment;
(ii) local distribution network and subscriber plant in Ouagadougou,
Banfora, Bobo-Dioulasso, Fada NtGourma, Koudougou and Ouahigouya;
(iii) two low-capacity microwave links between Ouagadougou and Kou-
dougou and between Bobo-Dioulasso and Banfora;
(iv) equipment for the national and international transit exchange
in Ouagadougou and trunk switching equipment for Banfora, Fada
N'Gourma and Ouahigouya;



- 5 -
(v)  reconstruction of about 600 km of existing interurban
overhead lines and the construction of about 600 km of new
routes between regional centers and rural communities;
(vi)  new buildings at Ouagadougou, Banfora and Fada N'Gourma;
(vii) a power plant in the Ouagadougou exchange vehicles and
miscellaneous technical equipment and materials;
(viii) consultant's services to cover the detailed engineering
and construction supervision of the project, studies on
tariffs and budget organization; and
(ix)  training of technical and administrative personnel.
19.     The project costs estimated at about US$5.6 million equivalent, out
of which 0S$4.7 million or 84 percent would be in foreign exchange, are de-
tailed as follows:

20.     The proposed credit of US$4.5 million would be made to Upper Volta
on standard IDA terms. The Government would make the proceeds of the credit
available to OPT for a term of 20 years, including a four-year grace period,
at an annual interest rate of 7-1/4 percent. The conclusion of a project
financing agreement between the Government and OPT, based on the above terms,
would be a condition of effectiveness of the credit. The proposed credit
would finance 97 percent of the estimated foreign exchange cost of the project.
The remaining 3 percent represent the estimated foreign exchange component (about
$140,000) of buildings which will be constructed by local contractors and will be.
wholly financed from OPT's own resources in local currency.   The proposed credit.
would be disbursed against the CIF cost of imported equipment and the foreign
exchange cost of imported services and training as follows;

Total          4.5C
27.     With the probable exception of the two ricrowave links (para. 18 (iii))
all goods to be financed under the proposed credit would be procured through
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Association's Guide-
lines for Procurement. Originally these links had been planned as independent
facilities, estimiated to cost around US$800,000. However, OPT is now consider-
ing an alternative design, using in part facilities of a new French-financed
microwave link currently being constructed. Should this alternative prove
feasible it could result in substantial savings through the use of existing
components (such as pylons, power plant, antennae, etc...), but it would then
be necessaryfor compatibility, to procure the equipment for the two links from
the suppliers of the main system without international competitive bidding,
The Government' s standard tendering procedures, which are satisfactory to the
Adsociation, would be followed for the selection of local contractors for building
ard civil works to be financed by OPT. It is expected that the project would be
completed by December 31, 1977, and the credit closed by June 30, 1978.
22.     OPT, which is whoUly owned by the Government, would be responsible for
the execution of the project. Its statutes endow it with legal and financial
autonony. Its senior staff are competent. OPT is managed by a Director,
assisted by a Deputy Director, a Chief Accountant and the Chiefs of four divi-
sions (Administration, Postal/Financial Services, Telecomnunications and
Buildings, Transport and Supply Services).
23,     OPT does not yet have the technical expertise to handle the detailed
engineering or the procurement of the plant required for the project. It also
requires assistance in the supervision of the execution of the main works.
OPT therefore will appoint consultants acceptable to the Association to advise
on detailed engineering and the preparation of the specifications and bidding
documents, to assist in bid evaluation, and to supervise the execution of the
works, Installation of the equipment will be carried out by the suppliers, who
.rill enable OPT's staff to take part in the execution of the work, so as to
give them experience in installation, testing and maintenance, This will assist
OPT' I S ,.raining program.



22.       OPT's training program, though adequate, needs support for its execu-
tion. Under this program, which was partly financed under the first project,
OPT is currently training two suitably qualified nationals to replace in 1973
its two expatriate engineering advisers. The proposed credit would finance the
training abroad of a total of 15-20 technical and administrative staff, inclu-
ding Voltaic staff to replace OPT's expatriate chief accountant when he is due
to leave at the end of 1974.
25.       Under the first credit OPT was to carry out a review of its tariffs,
but it has not yet done so because of delays in the execution of the project and
because it was waiting for an ITU study of world tariffs to serve as a guide to
its own policy. Under the proposed credit OPT will now cormlete such review by
June 30, 1975, with the assistance of qualified telecommunications tariffs special-
ists, and arrangements for the subsequent implementation of the conclusions of
this review will be agreed thereafter with the Association.
26.       OPT has completed all the basic accounting requirements under the
terms of the first credit. In particular, separate accounts have been estab-
lished for postal/financial and telecommunications services. The current
accounting system is satisfactory. However, OPT's budgeting procedures need
improvement. During negotiations the Government and OPT agreed to review the
budgeting and related financial procedures with the assistance of budgeting
specialists, and implement as of January 1, 1975, improved budgeting methods
satisfactory to the Association. In particular, these new methods will provide
separate budgets for the postal/financial and the telecommunications operations.
27.       Given that OPT started operations on January 1, 1969, with minimal
financial resources and an inadequate organization, its financial performance
since then has been a creditable one. The financial position of OPT, and in
particular the telecomnunications services, as shown by the audited accounts
for 1971, and as estimated for 1972 and 1973, is sound. The rate of return
on telecommmnications net fixed assets has progressed from 7.4 percent in 1969
to about 10 percent currently.
28.       The future finances of OPT are expected to remain satisfactory, with
net income at an adequate level throughout the program period and improving
thereafter following the commissioning of the new facilities. Due to the
time-lag between commissioning of new plant and the build-up of related revenue,
OPT's financial rate of return on telecommunications net assets is expected to
decline until 1978, but it should not fall below 6 percent. Thereafter, with
additional revenue accruing from the new plant installed under the project, the
rate of return should recover to the present level. The Government and OPT
have agreed to take all measures necessary to ensure that these rates of return
are achieved.
29.        The major benefits of the project would arise from the improvement
of the existing telecommunications services in Upper Volta and the provision of
facilities to meet anticipated demand, estimated to increase at about 15 percent
per year for local telephone service, and at 10 percent per year for long
distance service. By filling an important gap in the infrastructure of the
country the project will assist current development schemes, mainly those in
agriculture, agro-industry and manufacturing. It will also assist the improve--
ment and expansion of health and other social services in the areas served.



- 8 -
Finally, the project will realize the full economic benefits of the teleconmuni-
ications investment program presently nearing completion. The economic rate of
return on the investments is estimated to be at least 20 percent.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHOKITY
30.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Upper Volta and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the
Association and the OPT, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for
in Article V, bection 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association
and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being
di-tributed to the Executive Directors separately.   The draft credit documents
conform generally to the pattern of credit documents for similar te'Lecommu-
nications projects.
31.      I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Art,icles
of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
3Ž2.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit,.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Cr. No. 141-UV  Telecommunications Project; us$0.8 million Credit of
February 1, 1969; Closing Date June 30,  973.
The project was intended to finance urgently required rehabi-
litation and expansion works for local distribution networks in Ouagadougou
and Bobo-Dioulasso, the reconditioning of obsolete iron-wire lines in the
provinces and the provision of carrier equipiient on trunk lines. After initial
delays, mainly due to difficulties in arranging for key expatriate staff to
advise on the works, this project is now proceeding satisfactorily. Completion
is now expected in November 1973, 22 months behind schedule.
El These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors on the progress
of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems which are
being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They should be
read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not purport to
present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 225-TN West Volta Cotton Project; US$6.2 million Credit of
December 30, 1970; Closing Date June 30, 197r.
FAC is providing a grant of further US$1.7 million for the
project. The project is the final stage of a cotton production development
program in West Upper Volta which originally started with technical assist-
ance from Compaginie Frangaise pozr le D6veloppement des Fibres Textiles
(CFDT) and FAC financing in 1963.  It consists of both expansion of the
area under cotton cultivation on some 46,000 farms and improvement of fields
through credit and extension services, and provision of better communications
and processing facilities. The project also includes funds for training of
s,vff, detailed engineering of secondary roads and preparation of the Second
(Black Volta) Cotton and Agricultural Development Project.
Although Upper Volta suffered a drought in 1971 for the
second year in, a row, cotton production in the project area increased by
33% in 1971/72 over the pre-project year of 1970 while elsewhere production
decreased by about l0%. Processing and marketing of' cotton lint and seeds
is the responsibility of a joimt venture between Government and CFDT which
made a net profit of about US$)00,000 in 1970/71 and of US$360,000 in 1971/72.
The 20,000 tons capacity ginnery financed under the project will be built
in time for operation by the end of 1974. The feasibility study of the Black
Volta Cotton and Agriculture Development project has been completed, and the
project is now being appraised.
The project is proceeding satisfactorily; the management is
adequate. AbouLt US$4.6 million are still undisbursed.
Cr. No. 316-UV Road Project; US$2.8 million; Credit, of June 26, 1972;
Closing Date December 31. l9750
The project comprises (a) the reconstruction of the Solenzo-
Koundougou (70 km) and the Hounde-Bereba (27 kmn) roads, and (b) feasibility
studies for about 400 km of primary roads, and engineering of those sections
found to have the highest priority.
The pre-selection of contractors for part (a) above took
place in November 1972. The bids were scheduled to be opened on March 1.
The Government has not yet informed the Association about the result of the
evaluation of bids. Regarding (b) above the Government proposed four roads
to be studied, and the Association agreed to only two, from Bobo-Dioulasso
to Hounde and Bobo-Dioulasso to Banfora (a total of about 190 km), these
being the only ones considered likely to show a satisfactory rate of return.

Cr. No. 317-UV Rural Development Fund Project' US$2.2 million; Credit of
June 26, 1972 Closing Date September 30, I976.
The project is designed to alleviate constraints to develop-
ment in rural areas, increase agricultural production, and assist rural acti-
vities in most parts of the country where the Government can provide support-
ing services. Between 300,000 and 450,000 people would benefit from the
project. The Rural Development Fund (RDF) Division has been established within
Banque Nationale de D6veloppement (BND) to execute the project; it started
operating in September, 1972. BND's performance and project management are
satisfactory. Currently it is preparing its first annual program on the basis
of proposals made by the Offices R6gionaux de Developpement (ORD). Main
components of this program will be wells and village warehouses. The project
which started slowly mainly due to delays over project prefinancing and staff
appointments is now proceeding satisfactorily. Arrangements are being made
for speedy progress in implementing the various sub-projects. Consideration
is also being given to the financing of drought relief measures under this
project.
