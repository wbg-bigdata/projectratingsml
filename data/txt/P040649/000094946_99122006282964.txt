1. CURRENT SITUATION AND BACKGROUND
1.1   Civil war and unrest have plagued Sierra Leone for more than nine years. Since 1991,
successive governments have been unable to completely defeat the rebel forces of the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF), and a coup d'etat led by disgruntled junior anny officers in
May 1997 ousted the government of Ahmad Tejan Kabbah after only 14 months in office.
Though the President was reinstated to power in February 1998 by the regional military forces of
the Economic Community of West African States' Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), the security
situation deteriorated toward the end of the same year culminatg in a well-coordinated attack on
Freetown by RUF and former Sierra Leonean army forces in January 1999. While the attack on
Freetown was countered by ECOMOG forces, property damage and loss of life were high
particularly in the eastem part of the city, the large areas of the northern and eastern provinces of
the country fell under the control of rebels and former Sierra Leone army forces. In response,
diplomatic missions and nearly all international agencies pulled out of the country. Subsequent to
the atack, ECOMOG has slowly regained control over some of the territory that it had lost to the
rebels and a military stalemate was established.
1.2   The attack on Freetown was significant for two main reasons. First, it demonstrated that
the forces of the RUF and the former Sierra Leonean Army (SLA) that had led the military coup
in 1997 were Lrger in number and better organized and equipped than previously believed.
Second, the subsequent stalemate reaffirmed that a strictly military solution to the problem would
be impossible. These two facts hasten the international community and the leadership of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to advocate more forcefully to the
Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) for a negotiated settlement to the conflict. With the active
support of the ECOWAS Chairman and the United Nations Special Envoy to the Secretary
General, the Government entered into political discussions with representatives of the RUF in
May following a cease-fire agreement. By June a peace agreement had been drafted and the RUF
political leadership had discussed the main elements of the agreement with their field
commanders. On July 7, 1999, the President of Sierra Leone, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, and the
political leader of the RUF, Foday Sankoy, signed the peace agreement ending the armed conflict
that had plagued Sierra Leone for almost a decade.
1.3   Sierra Leone and its development partners are now in the process of consolidating this
peace agreement, operationalizing a national disarmament, demobilization and reintegration
program, extending humanitarian relief activities and renewing national reconstruction efforts.
The return to Sierra Leone in early October of Foday Sankoy and Johnny Paul Koroma (leader of
the military junta) to take up responsibilities with the current government and to initiate the
political process which will allow the RUF and the AFRC to stand for office in the upcoming
presidential elections is a promising sign that the peace will hold. The international community is
moving quickly to help the govermnent consolidate its current position and to extend financial
assistance to face the challenges of the post-conflict recovery programs.

Background and Summary of the Conflict
1.4   The root causes of the civil war can be traced to the systematic long-term neglect of the
rural areas of the country and the exclusion of certain groups from political decision-making
under previous governments.  Local government was deliberately weakened and lacked
transparency, the judicial system had lost credibility, infiastructure had decayed and the provision
of social services had deteriorated consistently over a period of twenty-five years.
1.5   The immediate causes of the war can be linked to the civil war in neighboring Liberia and
the subsequent establishment and militarization of the Revolutionary United Front of Sierra
Leone. The Government of Sierra Leone supported the ECOMOG peacekeeping operation in
Liberia, which clashed with Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) in 1990.
In retaliation, the NPFL provided military assistance to a small movement of disaffected Sierra
Leonean exiles known as the Revolutionary United Front. The civil war in Sierra Leone began
on 23 March 1991, when the RUF, under the leadership of former Corporal Foday Sankoh,
initiated a guerrilla war in the east of the country. The stated objective of the RUF was to oust
the All People's Congress government of President J.S. Momoh. The Sierra Leone armed forces
were caught by surprise and were ill-equipped to confront the RUF threat. The conflict soon
spread to the southern and central regions of the country.
1.6   The war intensified in late 1994, when the RUF significantly expanded the scale and
scope of its military activities and threatened Freetown. As a result of this escalation of hostilities
and the associated breakdown of civil authority in large areas of the country, an estimated
1.5 million civilians from war-affeted areas fled to towns and cities in search of refuge.
Important mining operations such as Sierra Rutile, the Sieromco bauxite mine and key diamond
fields, were overtaken by the RUF twice in early 1995. This escalation reduced Sierra Leone's
official gross foreign exchange earnings by 500/o, disrupted agricultural production and curtailed
the activities of development agencies and the private sector.
1.7   From mid-1995 onwards, the RUF suffered a series of military defeats as a result of the
introduction by GOSL of Executive Outcomes1 and the gradual strengthening of the camajoh
(civil defense forces (CDF)) movement. With this series of military defeats and following the
multi-party elections in early 1996, the RUF agreed to a cease-fire and entered into direct
negotiations with the new Govermment of Ahmad Tejan Kabbah in March 1996. After several
months of negotiations and further kamajoh military pressure, the discussions culminated in the
signing of the Abidjan Peace Accord on November 30, 1996.
1.8   The Abidjan Accord, however, was not to be fully implemented. While certain elements
of the Accord were put in place - such as the establishment of a bi-partisan Commission for the
Consolidation of Peace - other aspects such as the formulation of a demobilization plan and the
deployment of peacekeeping forces were not. Escalaing hostilities between the armed forces, the
kamajors/CDF, and RUF, and deteriorating security in the provinces, were harbingers of the coup
in May 1997.
1.9   The AFRC coup was different from previous transitions in power in Sierra Leone in
several ways. First, not only was the executive branch overthrown, but the legislative process and
judicial system were also significantly debilitated or, for the most part, destroyed. Second,
nascent recovery efforts of the 14-month old Government were all but suspended with the closing

of most international donor and development operations, withdrawal of international staff, and
suspension of development aid. Finally, the level of random violence against civilian populations
and both public and private property had significant negative impact on the social fabric of the
countly and on business and investor confidence.
1.10 Restoration of the legitimate Government by ECOMOG in February 1998 brought once
more hope to resolve the conflict. The long process of rebuilding the country could again be
initiated. Important advances were made subsequently, most notably the design of a
comprehensive disarmament, demobilization and reintegration program. While the program
received wide international support and funding commitments, the security situation in the
country deteriorated. This culminated in the brutal January 1999 attack on Freetown. Most
international aid efforts to Sierra Leone were subsequently suspended. It is only with the signing
of the Lom6 Peace Agreement, which incorporates guarantees of free access for humanitarian
agencies to rebel-held areas, that humanitarian relief -, development - and donor organizations are
again looking to expand operations outside the relative safety of Westem Area.
The Lome Peace Agreement
1.11 The Lome Peace Agreement, was signed on July 7, 1999, by President Tejan Kabbah and
Foday Sankoh of the RUF, and witnessed by the Chairman of ECOWAS, the UN Special Envoy
to the Secretary General, and representatives of key regional governments. This Peace Agreement
established the foundation for a lasting peace, return of security and initiation of reconstruction
and development for Sierra Leone. Specifically, the Peace Agreement: (i) reiterates the earlier
signed cease-fire agreement and establishes appropriate bodies to monitor its implementation;
(ii) facilitates the transformation of the RUF into a political party and allows for the RUF and
AFRC personnel to hold public office; (iii) enables the RUF to join a Government of National
Unity through the appointment of Foday Sankoy as chairman of a newly formed Commission for
the Management of Strategic Resources, National Reconstruction and Development, and
providing the RUF with four minister and four deputy minister positions; (iv) establishes a
Commission for the Consolidation of Peace that will oversee the implementation of all structures
and efforts aimed at the promotion of national reconciliation and the consolidation of peace either
in existence or provided for under the Peace Agreement; and (v) establishes a Council of Elders
and Religious Leaders to serve as arbitrators of the Agreement in the event of conflicting
interpretations by the parties. The full text of the Peace Agreement is presented in Attachment 1
to this document.
1.12   While this is not the first agreement of its kind reached between rebel forces and the
GOSL, it is hoped that the level of international support for the accord (and in particular the
participation of the regional governments of Liberia2 and Guinea, as well as Nigeria that supplies
the majority of soldiers to the ECOMOG force) will prove critical in seeing this accord
implemented. The design and preliminary implementation of a comprehensive disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration progrm, which was lacking in previous peace efforts, is also
seen as essential to the long-term success of the accord. In addition, the recent return to Sierra
Leone of both Foday Sankoh and Johnny Paul Koroma to assume their respective responsibilities
as defined in the Peace Agreement is a promising sign that the political will of these two parties is
2 It is noteworthy that President Taylor of Liberia, who it has long been rumored was supporting the RUF
and AFRC against the GOSL, recently brokered the agreement between Foday Sankoy and Johnny Paul
Koroma to return to Sierra Leone as called for in the Peace Agreement

in place. Finally, the active participation of both RUF and AFRC representatives in the process
of operationalizing the disarmament and demobilization activities lends further hope that the
accord will be fully implemented.
Overall Economic and Social Impact of the War and Post-Coup Conflict
1.13   Eight years of war and coup-related unrest have devastated the national economy and led
to large scale social disruption. Substantive damage has been caused to the agriculture and
mining sectors, thereby greatly reducing rural food security and revenue earning capacity of the
country. A large percentage of public infrastructure has been destroyed, or has deteriorated due
to lack of maintenance. The loss of control over resources and diminished government revenues
drastically reduced foreign exchange receipts and fiscal revenues. The civil war has caused a
decline in export earnings from mineral resources, a decline in agricultural productivity and
increased imports of essential food items, such as rice and military equipment.
1.14  In spite of the civil unrest that plagued the country during the 1990's, the Government
had implemented a successful series of stabilization and structural reform policies that had
yielded significant results up until the time of the coup in May, 1997. From 1990/91 to 1996,
annual inflaion was reduced from over 100 percent to around 6 percent, and the budget deficit
was reduced from 12 percent of GDP to 6.8 percent in the period from 1989/90 to 1996. These
gains were achieved while at the same time protecting social sector spending despite budgetary
pressures related to the war. However, nine months of junta rule in 1997, and predominantly
unstable economic and political conditions during 1998 and early 1999 have reversed most of
ese advances. Real GDP was estimated to have contracted by over 20 percent in 1997, and the
overail budget deficit stood at 11.4 percent of GDP in 1998. It is estimated that real output
declined by approximately 9 percent during the first half of 1999. Nonetheless, the economic
siuation during the second half of 1999 is expected to improve with the political stabilization
resulting from the implementation of the July Peace Agreement. Government revenue is
projected to increase, and while budget outlays are also expected to increase in relation to
emergency relief and rehabilitation expenditures, the primary budget deficit for the year as a
whole is projected to be 7.8 percent of GDP. Nonetheless, given the expected resumption of
budgetary and other assistance in the last quarter of the year, the reliance on bank financing to
cover the budget deficit is expected to significantly decline, thereby reducing inflationary
pressure and stemming the fia in gross external reserves. An IMF mission, in October 1999, will
establish with Government the indicative reserve targets for end-December 1999, as part of their
proposed emergency post-conflict assistance policy program for Sierra Leone.
1.15   The social costs of the conflict have been equally high. Delivery of basic social services
has been dramatically curtailed in areas outside of the capital. Since 1991, more thn twenty-five
thousand lives have been lost as a direct result of the conflict. The war and related insecurity
have also caused the internal displacement of an estimated 1.2 million people (out of a total
population of 4.7 million), and most of the rural displaced fled to urban environments
characterized by inadequate housing and poor sanitary conditions. The population of Greater
Freetown alone increased from 731,000 in 1989 to more than 1.5 million by late 1995, thus
further straining already overburdened social services. Many of the displaced have been housed
by extended families, thus also stretching traditional coping mechanisms to their limits. As of
August 1999, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(UNOCHA) reports that there are still 150,000 registered internally displaced persons (IDPs).
However OCHA estimates that as many as 1 million people are at risk due to insecurity and the
inability of humanitarian agencies to access large parts of the northern and eastern regions of the

county. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that more than
500,000 people have fled Sierra Leone for neighboring countries since 1991, and that at present
almost the same number remain in neighboring countries.
1.16   The war and subsequent tunmoil have exacerbated already high levels of poverty in Sierra
Leone. Prior to 1991 it is estimated that about 80 percent of the population lived on less than one
dollar per day. Since then, the situation has deteriorated with the widespread destruction of
public infrasucture, massive population displacements, and the withdrawal of foreign
investment. The civil war and post-coup period have also been characterized by economic rent-
seeking. Looting for food, cash crops and other material goods became a means of survival and
often a source of profitable business for elements within both the RUF and the AFRSL.
Moreover, control over the illicit diamond mining and trade in the areas bordering Liberia
became a way for the RUF to finance the procurement of arms and other supplies. These factors
contributed significantly to the prolongation of the war.
1.17   The conflict has also contributed to the weakening of traditional authority structures at
the chiefdom level, and the reduction of trust at the community and family levels, as leaders and
elders have been killed or displaced, women have been sexually abused and children have been
abducted. Systematic attacks on authority figures (both human and symbolic- as in desecration of
secret society "bushes") were a feature of RUF stategy. The remnants of the AFRC junta have
also tried to undermine the existing authority structures in the towns and villages that they have
attacked since being ousted by ECOMOG. Nonetheless, these social structures too have shown
remarkable resilience. Many chiefs were sent out of harm's way by their subjects in order to
protect their authority; the displaced persons camps have typically been organized in accordance
with chiefdom structures; and the command, control and recruitmnent mechanisms for the
kamajoh/CDF movement are closely linked to the chiefdom governance system. Civil society
reaction to and condemnation of the May coup was rapid, the call for a return of the
democratically elected government was loud, and, ironically, the nine-month period of AFRC
rule served to strengthen many local level institutions that were left to fend for themselves in the
absence of any central-level support or control. Since the return of the Kabbah government, civil
society representatives have been both active and vocal in calling for a peaceful settlement of the
9-year conflict.
1.18   The civil war and the coup are clearly both symptoms and causes of the weakness of the
Sierra Leonean state. The long-term decline of state services, a governance system characterized
by corruption, and the politics of regional exclusion were key causes of the civil war. The large
scale destruction of infrastructure, economic resources and social displacement in the course of
the conflicts have further weakened the governance capacity of the state. The recovery and
reintegration process must address the underlying socio-economic causes of the war for Sierra
Leone to resume a path of peaceful and democratic social and economic development.
Security
1.19   Security in Sierra Leone has improved significantly since the low point in January 1999
when AFRC and RUF forces attacked Freetown. A cease-fire agreement signed in May of this
year has held, GOSL and RUF representatives took part in detailed technical discussions in Togo
during May and June, and on July 7, 1999, a Peace Agreement was signed between the GOSL
and the RUF. Since then, RUF and AFRC leadership (Sankoy and Koroma) have retumed to
Freetown and are traveling around the country briefing their respective forces on the peace
agreement, disamament and demobilization; RUF and AFRC representatives have begun

participating at operational levels in the implementation of the disarmament and demobilization
efforts; and while some tensions remain, especially in relation to AFRC representation in the
Peace Agreement, these have been defused through negotiations rather than violence. Access to
the capitals of the Southern and Eastern provinces has been restored and while rebel troops still
control large portions of the north and east of the country, they have established procedures and
mechanisms to allow humanitarian agencies access to these areas and the at-risk populations
there. The UN has improved the security rating for Western Area and Southem Province to a
level 3 and the US Embassy has reopened at the end of September, 1999. It is expected that with
the rapid implementation of the Government's comprehensive disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration (DDR) program the security situation in the North and East of the country will
improve rapidly.
Current Situation
1.20   Sierra Leone reached a low point in its nine year rebel war, when RUF and AFRC forces
mounted a well-coordinated attack on Freetown that drove the ECOMOG forces responsible for
maintaining security in the country out of two-hirds of the city. A week-long battle ensued in the
central and eastem parts of the city hat resulted in an estimated 5,000 deaths, as yet uncalculated
destruction of property, and the displacement of more than 50,000 citizens from the eastern end
and outskirts of the city. ECOMOG forces were eventually able to regain control of the city, the
Western Area, and some territory lost to the advancing forces in December and January. A
military stalemate was achieved with the Western and Southern areas of the country controlled by
ECOMOG and CDF personnel, while large portions of the East and North of the country were
held by rebels. The result of this siuation was a clearer realization on the part of the Government
and the international community that had been supporung Tejan Kabbah that a negotiated
settlement with the rebel forces was the only practical option. This led to detailed technical
discussions between the GOSL and RUF leadership, which allowed the RUF leadership
(Foday Sankoh) to meet with RUF field commders. At the same time, a 3-day "National
Consulation on the Peace Process" exercise was undertaken by civil society representatives
aimed at strengtening the Government's mandate in the peace negotiations. Ultimately, in this
context, and with the encouragement and support of the ECOWAS Chairman and the UN Special
Envoy to the Secretary General, the Government and the RUF signed a Peace Agreement in
Lom6 on July 7, 1999.
1.21   The signing of the Peace Agreement has led to almost immediate action on the part of
Government and its major development partners to begin addressing the humanitarian crises that
is looming in large areas of the country (most notably the north and east); the need to disarm,
demobilize and reintegrate a now estimated 45,000 combatants from the forces of the RUF,
AFRC, AFSL and the CDF; and to restart interrupted efforts at rebuilding the lives and
communities that have been adversely affected by the past nine years of conflict. The
Government has helped coordinate the humanitarian efforts of the NGOs, UN agencies and line
ministries, and has revised and updated the National Disarmament, Demobilization and
Reintegration Program based on the changing circumstances post-January 1999. A multi-donor
mission carried out in September 1999 reviewed and reiterated its support of the priorities
previously identified by Government, including: security, demobilization and reintegration of ex-
combatants, implementation of the national reconstruction, rehabilitation and resettlement
program, governance and rule of law, economic management, decentralization and capacity
building. The International Contact Group (ICG) for Sierra Leone is monitoring the
implementation of Government's respective recovery efforts and is seeking to assist the
Govermment to mobilize resources for these priority areas. In terms of security, the Economic

Community of West African States has agreed to maintain the presence of the 12,000 person-
strong ECOMOG force to maintain security until a new Sierra Leonean army can be recruited and
trained, and the United Nations has approved a team of 210 military observers (UNOMSIL) to
monitor the disariament and demobilization process and to take receipt of surrendered weapons.
In October 1999, the UN Security Council approved a 6,000 person strong Peace Keeping force
for Sierra Leone.
1.22   The President formally established two government institutions with responsibility for
overseeing the short-term reintegration and rehabilitation efforts of the country: the National
Committee for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (NCDDR), and the National
Commission for Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation (NCRRR). The overall
managers of each institution (respectively, the Executive Secretary and the Commissioner) have
been appointed and core technical staffed recruited and hired. The Government has also begun
implementing concrete efforts to resume its role as coordinator and facilitator of the overall
recovery and reconstruction efforts of government ministries, NGOs, and community groups.
The NCRRR structure and staffing requirements have been reviewed and revised in careful
consultation with donors, a plan of action and three-year budget have been developed and are
being considered by NCRRR's major partners, and the coordination mechanisms at central and
regional levels have been reestablished and are funcdoning with a high degree of efficiency.
1.23  In 1998, the GOSL also developed a comprehensive program framework for the
disaLmament demobilization and reintegration (DDR) of all ex-combatants (including AFRSL,
RUF, and CDF personnel). The proposed strategies of the DDR Program were discussed at the
special UN conference held in July, 1998, that was well-attended and resulted in renewed
international commitment to Sierra Leone and its programs of national recovery, as well as
support to ECOMOG. The UK Department for Intemational Development (DFID) provided
technical and financial assistance to facilitate the implementation of phase I of the program that
had targeted approximately 7,000 ex-combatants. However, the breakdown in security in late
1998 that culminated in the January 6, 1999, attack on Freetown interrupted activities under the
DDR program, as well as humanitarian and nascent reconstruction efforts in much of the country.
1.24   Subsequently to the January 6t attack on Freetown, the GOSL undertook to review the
status of the DDR Program jointly with key partners including ECOMOG, UNOMSIL, UNICEF,
DFID, EU, World Bank and other civil society stakeholders. This review was initiated in the
context of promising signs that a conducive political environment had developed that would lead
to a political settlement of the conflict. Following the signing of the Lome Peace Agreement, the
program has been restarted with the opening of the demobilization camp in Lungi, continuation of
training activities, and the identification of possible short-term public works employment
opportunities for the ex-combatants. The DDR program is currently moving ahead quickly with
the establishment of necessary reception centers and demobilization camps in different areas of
the country.
1.25   The level of commitment and ownership on the part of the Government for these
initiatives, the substantive progress made in initiating key program activities, and the wide-spread
international donor community support for the Government's efforts encourages hope for the
success of the overall recovery efforts of Sierra Leone and its partners.

2. GOVERNMENT RESPONSE AND STRATEGY
Government Strategy
2.1   In light of a cease-fire brokered with the RUF in early 1996, the Govermnent of Sierra
Leone carried out an extensive needs assessment of war-affected areas as the basis for
formulating a national plan for the resetdement, rehabilitation, and reconstruction of the country.
The plan, referred to as the National Resettlement, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program
(NRRRP), was presented to the donor community at a UNDP Roundtable Conference in
September 1996. At the core of the NRRRP was an initial Quick Action Program (QUAP) that
focused on 17 different sectors or program areas considered crucial for the social and economic
recovery and revitalization of the country. The QUAP specifically targeted short-term priority
areas of post-war reconstruction, focusing on resettlement of displaced persons, demobilization
and reintegration of ex-combatants, re-establishment of basic social services, and reconstruction
of economic infrastructure particularly related to agricultural production. The signing of the first
Peace Agreement between the Government and the RUF in November 1996 gave hope to national
and international efforts to begin the recovery process in earnest. Commitments made in
September began to become project agreements between donor countries, the GOSL, and various
implementing partners on the ground. The Roundtable Conference yielded pledges of
approximately US$230 million, and formal commitments were estimated at 50% of this total by
November, 1996.
2.2    During the same period, the Government elaborated a Poverty Reduction Strategy that
was anchored on the principle of growth with equity, and developed a Good Governance Strategy
that dealt with decentralization of admstration, civil service refonn, strengthening of civil
society, and promotion of transparency and accountability in the public service. These strategy
documents were presented to a Consultative Group of donors in March, 1997, resulting in pledges
of more than US$600 million. The coup of May 1997, however, effectively put the NRRRP, the
QUAP, as well as these other program activities, on hold.
2.3    While President Tejan Kabbah's Government was in exile, and immediately following
the reinstatement of democratic rule in March 1998, the Government considered its options and
the priority actions it would take to ensure rapid recovery of the country upon its return to power.
Two documents were prepared that highlighted the GOSL's vision for national recovery, namely:
Restoration to Democratic Civilian Rule in Sierra Leone; a 90 Day Programme (November
1997), and Post-conflict Recovery Programme; Preparedfor Consultations with Donors - March
1998. The conclusion of the second document is that the original NRRRP and QUAP priorities
and funding esinates remain valid and that these program documents should continue to guide
discussions with the Government's development partners and the donor community in general.
The original and revised GOSL estimates of costs for the QUAP are shown in Table 2-1.
2.4   Innmediately upon returning to power, the Government undertook to develop a
comprehensive program of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants - a
specific and concerted strategy notably absent from the Government's pre-coup recovery
program.  The Program, described in the National Disarmament, Demobilization and
Reintegration Program (NDDRP) document of July 1998 (amended in April 1999), will target

approximately 45,000 former combatants of the AFSL, AFRC, the RUF, and the CDF in three
phases over a three-year period. The program has been developed with the assistance of several
donors including DFID, UNDP, World Bank, and UNOMSIL, and has benefited from close
Government consultations with ECOMOG. The Government has shown the highest level of
political commitment, mobilized broad support from stakeholders and the international
community, and moved quickly to establish the implementation strategies and structures required
for the program. The NDDRP, estimated to cost approximately US$33.5 million3, was presented
to and received the wide support of the international community at a special conference called by
the UN Secretary General in July, 1998. An initial phase to demobilize 3,000 former anny
personnel held by ECOMOG was initiated in late 1998 and is now being completed after a six-
month hiatus resuling from the attack on Freetown. Additional support for the NDDRP is being
consolidated through the International Consultative Group that was formed as a result of the
July 1998, UN Conference.

highlighted in the national recovery program documents. These same priorities were reiterated
during the most recent multi-donor mission of September 1999 and a number of donors are
currendy updating their commitments and actively financing elements of the NRRRP and
NDDRP. In addition, the Government is currently following up on information requested by
donor agencies and governments during a donors conference held in Washington in
September, 1999.
Program Framework and Resource Requirements
2.6   In view of the diverse and interrelated natre of the problems engendered by the conflict,
as well as the country's long-term socio-economic decline, GOSL recognizes the need for a
comprehensive strategic framework for guiding the reconstruction and recovery processes.
Moreover, since the country is still in transition from war to peace, the program is anchored
within the context of a continuum from relief to development. Within this framework, the short-
run emergency relief, resettlement, rehabilitation, and reintegration measures are intended to lay
the foundation for resumption of normal development activities. To ensure a successful transition
to the development phase, it is recognized that measures would have to be put in place for the
demobilization of ex-combatants and their reinsertion into civil society, as well as for an orderly
rturn and reintegration of the intemally displaced and refugees.
2.7    With the considerable loss of production capacity in most parts of the country and the
deterioration and/or destruction of much of the basic physical and socio-economic infrastructure,
it is essential that quick rehabilitation measures be put in place immediately after the resettlement
of the displaced people. This will contribute to the restoration of an appropriate socio-economic
environment necessary for normal development processes over the medium-term.
Analysis of Commitments to the NRRRP and NDDRP
2.8   Before assessing the commitments, it is important to recapitulate two important
expectations about program financing related to the extent of local participation, and the nature of
-exnal assistance. First, from the outset, it was estimated that the local contribution to the
progran would be in the order of 10-15%. This would comprise contributions by Government,
local communities, the private sector and external sources. Government's contribution would be
in the form of budgetary allocations to cover mainly the local cost of both development and
recurrent expenditures. The contribution of local communities is expected to be principally in
kind, through the provision of local materials and labor for community programs and projects.
Regarding the private sector, the expectation is that it would progressively promote some of the
planned activities, from transportation of relief goods to reconstruction and developmental
activities. Second, with respect to international support, it is expected that funding would come
pardy from re-allocations of already committed funds, the utilization of which had been
constrained by the escalaton of the war. Government recognizes that redirecting existing loans
and grants would have to be negotiated in detail with individual donors and international financial
institutions.
2.9   The most significant commitments to the post-war recovery programs have been made by
the following international organizations: UNDP and other UN agencies, World Bank, European
Union, African Development Bank/Fund, and by the Governments of the UK, US, Germany,
Japan, Saudi Arabia, and others. The discussion below summarizes commitments made by Sierra
Leone's major partners in the recovery program.

2.10   The African Development Bank/Fund (AfDBtADF) will provide support to the NRRRP
thrgh its ongoing investment program as well as by providing new resources. With regard to
the latter, the AfDB/ADF has committed approximately US$12.24 million for a new emergency
project that will co-finance, along with IDA, the Government's Emergency Recovery Support
Fund (ERSF). In addition, USS6.2 million from the ongoing Social Action and Poverty
Alleviation (SAPA) Program, together with the newly proposed US$17 million Health project,
will be used to address emergency recovery needs. The Government and ADB have recently
agreed that the implementation anangements for SAPA, a social fund used to support multi-
sector activities including micro-enterprise development and rehabilitation efforts in health and
education, would be streamlined and adapted to the Government's ERSF procedures.
2.11 The European Commission (EC) has initiated implementation of a US$11.45 million
Resettlement and Rehabilitation Program, which was suspended soon after start-up m
February, 1997. The program will be extended to include all 12 rural districts of the country, and
will also target the urban areas adversely affected during and immediately following the junta
regime. The EC will continue its emergency agriculture recovery program, provide an additional
US$2.2 million for seeds and tools to enable farners to resume food production activities, and
will continue supporting refugee assistance for Sierra Leoneans in Guinea and Liberia. Programs
are currently being developed in support of child soldiers and civic education. The EC is also
providing support to the GOSL in the critical area of public financial maagement through
institutional assistance to the Ministry of Finance.
2.12   The Islamic Development Bank (IDB) has committed USS2.75 million for an Emergency
Assistance Project which will finance the provision of medicines, food and other supplies for the
displaced; rehabilitation of peripheral health units and primary schools; and rice seed production.
A Project Coordination Unit has been established within the National Commission for
Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation (NCRRR) to oversee the implementation of the
project. The IDB has appraised its planned assistance and disbursements have commenced.
2.13   UNDP has been and will continue to support the Government's recovery efforts in
several ways. First, US$4.5 million has been committed for the Preventive Development
Program to be implemented through the NCRRR, and approximately US$200,000 has been
allocated in support of local non-governmental organizations and governmental coordination
capacity.
2.14   The Government of Japan committed US$0.6 million for multi-sectoral activities through
the UNDP-managed Trust Fund. The entire amount has been disbursed to the Trust Fund.
2.15   During 1996-97, the United Kingdom provided US$1.6 million for a pilot demobilization
program channeled through the UNDP Trust Fund. A balance of approximately US$0.6 million
is currently being used to support the newly established Executive Secretaiat of the DDR
Program. In addition, DFID has pledged approximately US$10 million in support of the DDR
Program (of which approximately US$4.5 million has been committed since 1998). DFID is also
supporting NGO-implemented emergency agriculture rehabilitation activities, and is also
supporting governance and capacity building for policing and security activities.
2.16 The International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) has discussed with
Government the possibility of reprogramming approximately US$1.5 million from the North
Central Agriculural Project in support of the Government's ERSF to support efforts at
developing a policy framework for community-based sub-project financing, and to assist in the
area of long-term community-level food security.

2.17   The US Government is providing approximately US$34 million for food security,
agriculture recovery, nutrition rehabilitation, child tracing, and reconciliation activities during
1999, and a similar amount is expected for fiscal year 2000. While food aid constitutes
approximately half of this total assistance (US$16.4 million) significant non-food aid is being
provided by several different offices of the US Agency for International Development (USAID).
These inputs are channeled through both NGOs and UN agencies.
2.18   The IDA-financed Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation Project (CRRP) wiln
provide US$25 million to support the social and economic reintegration of IDPs, refugees, ex-
combatants, and the urban unemployed. These funds will be channeled through two principal
implementation mechanisms; the Emergency Recovery Support Fund (ERSF) that will support
social and economic recovery of communities, and the Training and Employment Program that
supports the social and economic reintegration of former combatants. In addition, the Bank-
financing health sector investment project will be restructured to support emergency health sector
rehabilitation needs, and the transport sector project is adequately flexible to allow for support to
recovery related activities as identified and agreed to between the Govermment and the Bank.
2.19   Table 2-2 below summarizes current actual or proposed support to the Government's
national recovery programs. Several donor countries, such as Sweden, Holland, Norway, Canada
and Germany, have indicated their readiness to support the NRRRP and the NDDRP; however,
the specific nature and level of support has yet to be determined.

3. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
3.1   The Government of Sierra Leone has prepared and presented to the international
community two programs for economic and social renewal in response to eight years of armed
conflict and more than two decades of misrule, neglect of social infrastructure, and misuse of
economic assets. These programs are outlined in the National Resettlement, Reconstruction and
Rehabilitation Program (NRRRP) and the Nahtonal Disarmament, Demobilization and
Reintegration Program (NDDRP) documents. Both of these program documents have been
widely distributed to and received support from the international donor community and Sierra
Leone's development partners, first at the UNDP Roundtable Conference held in Geneva in
September, 1996, and more recently at the special UN conference sponsored by the Secretary
General in New York in July 1998.
3.2   Upon being reinstated to power in March, 1998, President Kabbah formally established
the two institutions that would oversee the implementation of the two national programs outlined
in these documents.  These institutions, the National Commission for Reconstruction,
Resettlement and Rehabilitation (NCRRR) and the National Committee on Disarmament,
Demobilization and Reintegration (NCDDR), have limited and time-bound mandates, are staffed
by local consultants, and will operate outside of standard civil service procedures to help maintain
their independence and improve their efficiency. NCRRR will coordinate and monitor
implementation of the NRRRP, while NCDDR will have responsibility for overseeing the
NDDRP.
National Commission for Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation
3.3   In light of the integrated and multi-sectoral needs of reconstruction and recovery, both
Government and key donors have recognized the need for a sectorally integrated mechanism to
oversee the NRRRP. NCRRR has been created to fulfill this role in the same way that the former
Ministry of National Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation was.  Unlike its
predecessor, however, NCRRR does not have a civil service administrative branch. Also, in line
with donor and development partner recommendations, the Commission has rationalized its
structure to better reflect its coordination and monitoring mandate, and has strengthened the focus
on decentralized sub-project appraisal. The organiional structre of NCRRR is shown in
Figure 3-1 on the following page.
3.4    NCRRR will facilitate dialogue between and coordinate the programs and activities of
NGOs, line ministries, donor agencies and other implementing partners active in the emergency
recovery program, and monitor and report on all recovery activities undertaken in the country.
NCRRR will also oversee the implementation of the Emergency Recovery Support Fund (ERSF),
a demand driven community-based social fund designed to facilitate the social and economic
recovery of communities and the restoration of basic social and economic services. The ERSF
targets internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees, and ex-combatants. However, in keeping
with its inter-sectoral and coordination role, the Commission will not directly implement recovery
activities financed by the ERSF; this responsibility will rest with its partner organizations,
including NGOs, line ministries, public authorities and community based organizations.

The Commission has been established with a finite life span of three years reflecting the short-
term, emergency, focus of the Government's recovery program. The Commission should cease to
operate once the immediate needs of resettlement and emergency rehabilitation are addressed,
leaving the longer-term needs of development to the traditional governmental agencies and NGOs
active in the various sectors.3.5 NCRRR consists of three technical units, one administrative unit,
and three project units, namely:
* Directorate of Programming and Coordination (P&C)
* Directorate of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (PM&E),
* Information and Sensitization (IS) Unit,
* Administation, Accounts and Logistics Unit (AAL),
* Social Action and Poverty Alleviation (SAPA) Project Unit,
* Islamic Development Bank Project Implementation Unit (EAP) and,
* UNDP Preventive Development Program Unit.
3.6 Each Directorate is composed of a Director and one or more Program Managers
responsible for different functional areas. The IS Unit is headed up by a Program Manager with
one Project Officer as staff, and the AAL Unit is headed by an Executive Secretary and composed
of three additional staff The SAPA and EAP Units are headed by Directors who have between
two and four functional staff, while the UNDP Program Unit is headed by a chief technical
advisor with one national counter-part. Financial management and procurement of all RRR
related sub-projects under the IDA Credit will be handled by a separate Financial Management
and Procrement Unit, which is described below. In addition, four regional offices have been
established to coordinate and oversee NCRRR operations in the three provincial capitals (Makeni,
Bo and Kenema), and in Freetown for Western Area. These regional offices (see Figure 3-2) will
be headed by the Regional Coordinator, staffed with two Projects Officers, a Finance Officer, an
Information/Sensitization Officer, and will be supported by HACU field officers4. The main
responsibilities of the regional office will be:
* information sharing and coordinating activities among NCRRR, line ministries, NGOs and
regional authorities (government and chiefdom);
* providing technical and administrative support to the ERSF Projects Committee in
reviewing project proposals and monitoring project implementation,
* monitoring the work of implementing organizations (line ministries and NGOs) in carrymg
out the regional program; and
* reporting on implementation progress for the national program to the central Commission.
NCRRR is also discussing the possibility of including a United Nations Volunteer for conflict
resolution in each of the regional NCRRR offices.
3.7    District offices will also be established in each of the district headquarters5 and three
staff, namely a District Supervisor and two Community Development Officers, will be placed in
each. This staff will have primary responsibility to facilitate the participation of communities in
the ERSF and to monitor the activities of NCRRR's partner organizations in implementing the
RRR Program.
4   One national staff in all three regional offices and one expatriot staff seconded to the UN Office for
the Coordinator of Humanitran Affairs (UNOCHA) by the Norwegan Refugee Council (proposed
for Makeni and Kenema).
Distict offices in the three provincial capitals will be incorporated into the regional RRR offices,
where space permits, to economize on logistical support requirements.

3.8    All NCRRR technical staff will be hired under one-year renewable performance-based
contracts which are independent of civil service salary and benefits regulations. In addition, all
staff financed by the IDA Credit, UNDP preventive development program, and the AflDB
emergency project will require the approval of the respective donor agency, helping to ensure
that the Commission will be staff with well qualified personnel.

National Committee on Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration
3.9   Ihe overall DDR program will be implemented under the guidance and supervision of
the National Committee on Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (NCDDR), a
temporary institution officially established by Government in July 1998. NCDDR will coordinate
a program of assistance to all ex-combatants, which will include the demobilization and
reintegration of AFRC, RUF and CDF personnel, as well as assistance to child and disabled
combatants. NCDDR will also oversee the implementation of the Training and Employment
Program (TEP). The NCDDR is chaired by the President and comprises the following members:
National Security Advisor, ECOMOG Task Force Commander, Deputy Minister of Defense,
Minister of Internal Affairs and Local Administration, NCRRR Commissioner, Minister of
Finance, Minister of Information, Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General, a representative of
the lead donor agency and the Executive Secretary of the NCDDR as its secretary.
3.10   An Executive Secretariat (ES) to the NCDDR has been established to earry out the day-
to-day operational issues related to NCDDR's mandate. The Secretariat relies on local and
international NGOs, Ministry of Education affiliated and independent vocational training
institutions, and private businesses to provide the services required under the TEP. An Executive
Secretary heads up the Secretariat and is responsible for reporting to the GOSL and donors on all
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration support provided under the Credit for ex-

combatants. The ES will be responsible for ensuring (i) the planning and implementation of the
individual program components in collaboration with other government departments, NGOs and
donors; (ii) the transparent and accountable administrai  of the program (including procurement
and disbursements); and (ini) monitoring and evaluation. The Govermment has already recruited
technical staff at central level with the support of the PPF and DFID, and the Project will continue
supporting these staff as well as provide for essential goods and services for the Secretariat in
close collaboration with DFID. The ES is composed of four units at national level with
responsibility for: disarmament and demobilization, reinsertion and reintegration, information and
sensitization, and monitoring and evaluation. A military liaison office has also been established
to facilitate cooperation with ECOMOG and UNOMSIL on all security-related aspects of the
program. Financial management and procurement for all DDR activities supported under the
IDA Credit will be handled by a separate Financial Management and Procurement Unit
(described below). The organigram of the NCDDR/Executive Secretariat is shown in figure 3-3.
3.11   Regional Reintegration Offices (RROs) will be established in three regional capitals as
well as in the Western area. Each RRO will comprise 6 staff, namely a regional reintegration
coordinator, two ex-combatant counselors, two employment promoters, and an accountant. The
Govenmnent is currently recruiting RRO staff that would be responsible for:
* information dissemination and counseling;
D administration of reintegration assistance;
D monitoring and evaluation; and
coordination with NCRRR, other government agencies, administrative authorities, local
leaders, and other project interventions that target ex-combatants.
3.12   Each RRO will be assisted by a regional technical committee that will be headed by a
Regional Reintegration Officer and be comprised of representatives from the local administration
and/or sector ministry, taditional or religious leaders; NGOs and local businesses. This regional
reintegration committee will advise the RROs on: (i) community sensitization; (ii) program
implementation; (iii) conflict resolution related to ex-combatant reintegration; (iv) co-ordination
with other rehabilitation/reintegration interventions; and (v) security issues.
3.13 Government recognizes that the activities of NCRRR and NCDDR are not mutually
exclusive and that the overall success of both programs relies on close and integral coordination
between the two institutions. Therefore, the programs have established linkages at the national
policy level and will do the same at the regional implementation level through the various
committees designed to facilitate coordination (described in detail in the next section.)
Financial Management and Procurement Unit (FMPU)
3.14   A Financial Management and Procurement Unit will be established to provide NCRRR
and NCDDR with technical expertise in all aspects related to financial management and
procurement. This unit will be set up and managed by an internationally recruited firm with
project and financial management experience, and will ensure the highest degree of
accountability and transparency in the implementation of the Project and Program. It is expected
that the FMPU will oversee funding provided by several donor agencies for the national RRR and
DDR Programs. The Unit will be headed up by a senior project management expert with
significant international experience, and be composed of three technical units responsible for
accounting and disbursements, procurement, and internal control of all relevant program
resources. The FMPU will work closely with personnel of NCRRR and NCDDR, and with the

4. COORDINATION MECHANISMS IN PLACE
4.1    Overall aid management and coordination in Sierra Leone continues to be weak, although
the Government is making efforts to limit the entry channels for resources and streamline the
control system. The Department of Development (under the Ministry of Finance, Development
and Economic Planning) is charged with the responsibility of coordinating, managing and
monitoring development assistance, of which the NRRRP and NDDRP will be mrajor components
in the near term. However, specific responsibility for the coordination of activities related to the
recovery efforts is the responsibility of NCRRR, while those related to demobilization and
reintegration will fall to NCDDR. Still, donor agencies and international NGOs continue to deal
directly with the respective line ministries, or in some cases regional authorities, with which they
have long-standing relations and a tradition of cooperation. While information on these
respective funding decisions and activities is, for the most part, transmitted to one or more GOSL
office, the Government's capacity to collect and consolidate this information, or to monitor the
work of these partners, is inadequate.
4.2    Nonetheless, Government's recent efforts to better coordinate the emergency relief and
initial recovery phase have been more successful due in large part to the assistance provided by
the Hmanitarian Affairs Coordinating Unit (HACU) of the UN Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA). Given the complex nature of the situation, and the frequent
need to respond quickly to an emerging crises in a multi-sectoral fashion, GOSL has taken a
number of steps to strengthen coordination. While NCRRR has taken a lead role in this area,
other organizations are involved in the coordination of the National Programs as well. These
organizations and their inter-linkages are described below.
National Level
4.3   Inter-Msrnteial Committee. This Ministerial-level Program Steering Committee was
established to facilitate the smooth operations of all aspects of the NRRR Program. This
Committee is chaired by the Commissioner of NCRRR, and is composed of the Ministers of
Finance, Development and Economic Planning; Agnculture, Forestry and Environment; Local
Govermuent, Land and Housing; Education; Health and Sanitation; and Social Welfire, Gender
and Children's Affairs. The Steering Committee meets regularly to deal with policy issues and to
address problems and constraints to NRRRP implementation, and will provide guidance to
NCRRR.
4.4    National Committee on Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration. NCDDR is
the policy making body for the DDR Program chaired by the President and is comprised of the:
National Security Advisor, ECOMOG Task Force Commander, Deputy Minister of Defense,
Minister of Internal Affirs and Local Administration, NCRRR Commissioner, Minister of
Finance, Development and Economic Planning, Minister of Informaution, the Special Envoy of the
UN Secretary General, a representative of the lead donor agency (the British High
Commissioner), and the Executive Secretary of the NCDDR as Committee secretary. NCDDR
formulates national strategies for, and coordinates all governmental activities that support, the
DDR Program; the Executive Secretariat (ES) will be responsible for carrying out the policy and
implementing, on a day-to-day basis, the responsibilities of the Government under the DDR
Program.

4.5    Consultative Forum. This forum was constituted to provide technical advise to the Inter-
Ministerial Committee on humanitaian relief and emergency recovery activities. The forum is
comprised of representatives from donor agencies, Government line ministries, and non-
governmental organizations, and gathers information from the specialized technical sub-
committees in the areas of agriculture, food aid, water and sanitation, health and nutrition,
education, shelter and roads, child protection, and sensitization and information. This forum
replaces both the inter-sectoral technical committee (composed of representatives of GOSL line
ministnes) and the national inter-agency forum that operated and advised MNRRR pnor to the
coup. The Forum is chaired by NCRRR.
4.6   Spedic Sectoral Commitees. A number of specific technical or sectoral committees are
currently operational and are responding to the needs of information sharing and coordination
among funding agencies, implementing partners and government institutions. Among these are
the national Committee on Food Aid, a Water and Sanitation Committee, an Agricultural Sub-
committee, and the Emergency Health Task Force. These committees discuss and establish
policy guidelines and operational procedures for their respective sectors and inform larger inter-
sectoral bodies (such as the Consultative Forum) of their deliberations. The Project makes the
best use of these bodies and mechanisms to help ensure appropriate levels of coordination of
donor funding and implementing partner activities.
4.7    Commission for the Consolidaion of Peace. This body has been established under the
Lm6 Peace Agreement to ensure the overall implementation of the post-conflict programs
envisioned by Government. The Commission will have as members two representatives of civil
society, and one representative each named by the Government, the RUF and the Parliament.
While the CCP's terms of reference have not yet to be specified, it is assumed that this body will
monitor the activities of the other institutions responsible for the implementation of the recovery
efforts, such as NCRRR and NCDDR.
Regional Level
4.8   Inter-Agency Fora. In response to the emergency relief activities carried out from 1995
to 1997, inter-agency forums (IAF) were formed in each provincial capital to serve as
mechanisms for information exchange and coordination between GOSL line ministries, NGOs,
relevant UN agencies, bilateral donors and community-based organizations. Participation in the
WF is open to all development partners and representatives of beneficiary groups and is chaired
by NCRRR. As with the Consultative Forum at national level, specialized sectoral committees,
such as those dealing with food aid, health and nutrition, or child protection, advise the IAF on
specific technical issues. The I4Fs also serve as the first point of review for subprojects
proposed for financing under the CRRP. Subsequent to the junta, the IAF in Freetown has been
superseded by the Consultative Forum.
4.9   Specd&ic Technical Committees. Numerous sector-specific committees and ad hoc
technical working groups exist at both regional and national level that address issues of technical
norms, procedures and coordination among agencies working in the same sector. Examples of
such committees include the Committee on Food Aid, the Water and Sanitation Committee, the
Demobilization Advisory Group, and the Agriculture Committee. These committees have either
formal or informal links to the regional and national inter-agency committees (i.e., LAF and the
Consultative Forum) and will serve the CRRP in terms of technical review and input to ERSF
sub-project review.

District Level
4.10   Distid Coorinaton Commiees (DCC). Under the NRRRP, DCCs will be formed by
NCRRR distict level staff with the assistance of the local authorities and line ministries, to assist
in the process of assessing local priorities and identifying finding gaps for recovery activities.
The composition of the DCC will include the NCRRR District Supervisor, and representatives of
local NGOs, line ministries, local government and chiefdom authorities.
Donor Coordination
4.11   The UNDP Resident Representative has traditionally assumed responsibility for donor
coordination in Sierra Leone, a country with few bilateral donors and where the dnve for
economic management reforms has been supported by the World Bank/IMF adjustment programs
through the Ministry of Finance. The UNDP Resident Representative is also the UN
Humanitarian Coordinator, which improves the linkage between emergency relief and longer
term rehabilitation assistance. HACUtUN-OCHA assists in coordinating the relief efforts of
NGOs and donors in Sierra Leone and also plays a critical role in providing technical assistance
to NCRRR.
4.12   The Government and the Bank have developed and maintained close and constructive
working relationships with key development partners and stakeholders in the preparation of the
proposed CRRP. Cooperation has been particularly close with DFID and the British High
Commission; the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary General and UNOMSIL; the
African Development Bank; the UN fimily, especially OCHA, WFP, UNICEF, UNHCR and
UNDP; the European Union; USAID; and several national and international NGOs. The Bank
has conducted joint missions or overlapped with several key donors including UNDP, DFID,
GTZ, AfDB, UNHCR, IFAD, and USAID's Office of Transitional Initiatives (USAID/OTI), and
has achieved a high degree of consensus on program strategies and respective institutional
support. This effective coordination among the Govermnent's key partners bodes well for
program implementation.

5. OBJECTIVES, RATIONALE AND STRATEGY FOR
BANK ASSISTANCE
Rationale for Bank Involvement
5.1   The GOSL clearly recognizes that demobilization and the subsequent social and
economic reintegration of ex-combatants, IDPs, and refugees are crucial for achieving lasting
peace, stability and economic growth. The Government has explicitly outlined its strategies for
addressing these priorities in two program documents previously noted (i.e., the National
Resettlement, Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Program (NRRRP) and the National
Disarmament, Demobilizanon and Reintegration Program (NDDRP)). The first progran is
based on an extensive needs assessment of war-affected areas carried out by the GOSL in mid-
1996, which was submitted to the international community at a UNDP Round Table Conference
in September 1996 in Geneva. Subsequent to the restoration of democratic rule in March 1998,
the GOSL reiterated the priorities outlined in this first document and the donor community
indicated their agreement with these priorities in the Joint Governent/Donor Communiqu6
issued in May, 1998. The second document, prepared after the return of the Kabbah Government,
was presented to the international community at a special meeting called by the UN Secretary
General in July 1998.
5.2    Both documents have been well received by donor agencies and development partners
active in Sierra Leone, and these organizations have moved quickly to support the program
strtegies outlined therein. Specifically: the United States, the European Union, UN agencies and
non-governmental organizations are assisting with emergency relief food security, and
emergency health services; DFID, UNOMSIL, and the Office of the Special Envoy on the UN
Secretary General are helping to support the demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants;
and UNDP, the African Development Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank are helping to
strengthen the institutional capacity of the National Commission for Reconstruction, Resettlement
and Rehabilitation.
5.3  The commitment of the GOSL and the international community to the recovery process
presents a unique "window of opportunity" to revitalize Sierra Leone's economic and social
development. This opportunity also brings with it raised expectations as well as conerns over
the Government's ability to nmnage the enormous post-war reconstruction effort facing the
country and to quickly succeed in: (i) consolidating peace and undertaking to disarm and
demobilize approximately 45,000 combatants; (ii) resettling 150,000 IDPs and repatriating nearly
500,000 Sierra Leonean refugees from Guinea and Liberia; (iii) rehabilitating key elements of the
country's rural infrastructure; (iv) providing material, financial and other inputs to Sierra Leonean
farmers to encourage resettlement and the resumption of agricultural production; and (v) restoring
basic social services, particularly primary health care and basic education.
5.4 This challenging post-conflict context provides the backdrop for the Bank's intervention.
Current confidence in, and high expectations of, the Government may be replaced with frustration
and skepticism if order and security are not reestablished, displaced populations are not
reintegrated, and social and economic infiastucture is not rebuilt. Consequently, timely and
adequate donor assistance is critical for longer-term economic development as well as social
stability.

Strategy for Proposed Bank Assistance
5.5  IDA is a leading player in Sierra Leone, with projects in two sectors of central concern to
the national recovery efforts- -inauct  and health- and a Project Preparation Facility (PPF)
for an institutional support Project in education. Furthermore, IDA is proposing to support
macro-economic reform in Sierra Leone through an Economic Recovery Credit As such, IDA is
well-positioned to support the Government's multi-sectoral reintegration and reconstruction
efforts. Its involvement is further justified by the amount of resources required for the recovery
programs, the poverty focus of the Project, the need to monitor the macro-economic impact of the
process, and the shortened time frame within which an Emergency Recovery Credit can respond.
5.6 During the immediate post conflict period of two to three years, rapid progress on
reintegration of ex-combatants, economic recovery and reconstruction, in the context of economic
stability wili be essential to the long-term economic development of Sierra Leone. Therefore,
post-conflict transition will be the central theme of IDA's assistance activities over the next few
years. To this end, the proposed CRRP would serve as IDA's primary instrument to support
rehabilitation, reconstruction and reintegration efforts in Sierra Leone, while the Economic
Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit will address short-term balance of payment and budgetary
support through a credit of USS 30.0 million. At the same time, the Integrated Health Sector
Investment Project (Cr. 2827SL) is being restructured, and the Transport Sector Project
(Cr. 2895-SL) is flexible enough to be adapted, to take account of the changing situation and
emergency resource requirements of the country.
5.7 The Government has adopted a phased strategy to the implementation of the national
recovery programs that has been instructed by post-conflict situations in Afiica and throughout
the world. The phases, and the acual and/or proposed financial support of each one, is
summarized in Table 5.1 below. In the short-term, the proposed CRRP will be central to this
phased strategy.

5.8  The first, transition phase, of the Government's strategy incorporates and implements
simultaneously the two major components of the DDR and RRR Programs, and the proposed
Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation Project intends to support these two components.
The first part of this phase will the improve the security situation through the structured
disarmament and demobilization of approximately 45,000 ex-combatants, including members of
the Armed Forces of Sierra Leone (AFSL), RUF and the Civil Defense Forces (CDF). The
second part will address the short-term needs for social and economic reintegration and
rehabilitation of ex-combatants and the vulnerable civilian population. The second development
phase of the Government strategy would affect a progression from short- and medium-term
reconstruction and recovery programs to longer-term development and poverty reduction through
more traditional investment projects.
Project Rationak
5.9   Security, social stability and future economic growth in Sierra Leone will depend, inter
alia, on the successful demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants, the return of IDPs and
refugees to their communities, and the revitalization of social and economic infrastructure.
Therefore, the Project, designed to provide the needed immediate support for the reintegration of
these groups and to strengthen the social and economic infiastructure in the communities most
affected by the war, will play an important role in the process of continued recovery. It is felt
that the social and economic reintegration of the target group lends itself well to IDA support
because of the Bank's overall poverty focus in its lending program in Sierra Leone and elsewhere.
5.10   Furthermore, one of the underlying causes of the civil war and conflict over the past
eight years has been the long-standing neglect of rural areas by the Central Government, resulting
in a long-term decline of social services and infrastructure and growing disenchantment among
large parts of the population. The Project will assist the process of redressing the urban bias in
national development through a decenralized sub-project identification and implementation
stregy, that should, if successful, rebuild confidence in GOSL's commitment and capacity to
respond to the needs of the society as a whole.
5.11 The underlying Project concept of providing assistance to the internally displaced,
refugees and ex-combatants, as well as to the receiving communities, is based on best practices
and experiences gained in similar IDA member countries and post-conflict situations, and is
deemed appropriate for achieving the development objective of the Project. The targeted public
works program for the urban unemployed, and the training and employment efforts directed at ex-
combatants are also based on successful Bank and other donor agency experiences in numerous
countries. The Project design is based on a collaborative review and assessment of key socio-
economic and other factors that have and will influence the emergency situation and recovery
process. The review was carried out by the World Bank, Government, and major stakeholders in
as thorough a fashion as possible given the changing security situation in-country during the last
three years. A list of all documents and reports from the project preparation phase contained in
the Project file is shown in Attachment 1 to this Technical Annex.

6. MODIFICATION OF ONGOING OPERATIONS/
REASSESSMENT OF THE LENDING PROGRAM
6.1   In addition to the Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation Project, the World Bank
will directly respond to the Government's National Programs through the reorientation and
modification of the existing portfolio of projects discussed below.
Integrated Health Sector Investment Project (IHSIP)
6.2   IDA has been a key partner in the Govermnent's recent efforts to develop and implement
a comprehensive health sector reform program, and has assisted the Government in promoting the
sector-wide investment approach among donors. IDA approved the Integrated Health Sector
Investment Project (CR. 2827-SL) in the amount of US$20.0 million equivalent in March 1996,
which supports the Government's core program for the health sector. The goal of the
Government's program (and the Project) is to improve the health status of the people of Sierra
Leone by increasing access to and improving the quality of a basic package of health services.
The principal program and Project strategies are to improve the management of the health care
delivery system and promote the decentralization of service administration and provision.
6.3    As the country moves out of the emergency phase it has found itself in over the past two
years, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) intends to address priority health sector
needs as defined in its Annual Transitional Plan (2000). During the current fiscal year IDA will
consider financing any of the priority activities identified under the Plan for which no other
source of funding is available. Preliminary MOHS assessments indicate that support will be
required for the main tertiary care facilities (Connaught, Kissy and Childrens Hospitals), and
possibly for the Central Medical Stores depending on other donor commitments. IDA has also
indicated interest in supporting MOHS' efforts to strengthen its STD/HIV/AIDS, family
planning, malaria, nutrition, and maintenance programs and systems, and would also support
capacity building activities in the areas of procurement and financial management for the
Ministry.
6.4    Due to implementation delays resulting from the 1997 coup d'etat and security
constraints during 1998 and 1999, approximately US$ 15.6 million of the Credit remains
available under the IHSIP as of August 1999. In light of these delays and the changing health
sector priorities in-country, the Government will request an extension of the Project closing date,
and proposes a formal restructuring of the Project to better address the emerging priorities,
particularly in relation to civil works activities. The mid-term review scheduled for late 1998, is
now planned for January/February 2000, and wili be used to guide the restructuring process.
Transport Sector Project (TSP)
6.5    A Credit in the amount of US$35.0 million was made available to the GOSL for the
Transport Sector Project (Cr. 2895-SL) in 1996 to support capacity building of the Government
institutions responsible for the sector; the restructuring and privatization of relevant parastatals;
and investments in road maintenance, traffic management, ports, airports and waterways.

Counby: Sierra Leone                                                  Page 29 of87
Specifically, the TSP aims to (i) build up the Coordination and Monitoring Unit of the Ministry of
Transport, Communications and Environment; (ii) establish a new autonomous Road Transport
Authority; (iii) develop small and medium sized labor-based enterprises for road works;
(iv) improve the organzatonal structure of the Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA);
(v) restructure Ports Authority; (vi) privatize the Road Transport Corporation, National Airlines
and the National Shipping Company; (vi) invest in a program of road maintenance for trunk
roads, feeder roads and city streets; (vii) undertake traffic management measures for Freetown;
(viii) repair and rehabilitate Freetown's port, slipway, quay and container stacking area;
(ix) repair the airport runway and edge lighting and procure safety equipment and perimeter
fencing; and (x) rehabilitate and provide coastal and riverway landings and storage facilities.
6.6   The status of the TSP was reviewed in Conalry in June 1999, and agreement reached
between IDA and the government in September 1999, on an interim one-year strategy that will
contribute to peace and reconciliation within the parameters of the Project agreement. It was also
agreed in September that there was no need to restructure the project in order to respond to the
emergency needs of the country. The focus of activities during the interim period will be to:
(i) enhance existing institutional capacities focusing on productivity, (ii) provide for labor-
intensive employment opportunities through small enterprises, (iii) rebuild feeder roads,
(iv) improve major road links to facilitate access to domestic and international markets,
(v) rehabilitate Freetown port capacity, and (vi) preserve investments and enhance air traffic
safiety at Lungi airport. As of July 12, 1999, almost US$30.0 million remained undisbursed under
the project.
Urban Water Supply Project (UWSP)
6.7   The Urban Water Supply Project (CR. 2702-SL) was designed to support a major
rehabilitation of the water supply system, the rehabilitation of a small existing sewage system,
and the establishment of a low-cost sanitation program for Greater Freetown, and to improve the
public and private sector capacities for operating and maintaining these systems. Specifically, the
Project will strengthen the Guma Valley Water Company (GVWC) and rehabilitate and expand
its infrastructure to provide water to Freetown, to carry out studies, and to improve water supply
operations in other major towns; to identify a role for the private sector in water provision; to
provide technical assistance for sanitation; to rehabilitate and extend, on a pilot basis, the
Ministry of Works, Energy and Power's (MWEP) existing sewage system, and to provide
supervision and institutional support to MWEP. The main implementing agencies are the
GVWC, the MWEP and the Sierra Leone Roads Authority which will manage the low cost
sanitation component of the Project.
6.8   The major beneficiaries of the Project are the population and businesses of Freetown
currently with limited or no access to safe water. The sanitation component would also assist the
planning and implementation of low-cost sanitation measures in the priority areas of Freetown,
again targeting directly the population in these areas. The Project became effective in August
1995, and is expected to close in December 1999. As of July 12, 1999, approximately
US$15 million (of the total Credit of US$35.0 million equivalent) had been disbursed.

Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (RRMP)
6.9   In August 1993, IDA approved a Credit of US$45.0 million equivalent to the GOSL for
the Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (CR. 2451-SL). The main objectives of the
Project are: (i) to remove physical bottlenecks in the country's transport network; (ii) to build the
institutional capacity of SLRA and the Department of Works of the MTCE; (iii) to strengthen the
transport sector institutions to improve sector management, planning and to foster market-
oriented policies; (iv) to encourage new methods of infastructure rehabilitation and maintenance;
(v) increase the share of private sector participation in road maintenance and develop capacity of
small-sized contractors to maintain the road network; and (vi) to promote the use of non-
motorized transport to increase rural mobility and improve transport services available for the
rural poor.
6.10   As of July 1999, this Project had disbursed all but approximately 10% of the credit and is
now scheduled to close on June 30, 2000. The remaining balance of funds will be used to
complete the road repair and naintenance works in the Greater Freetown area that were begun
prior to the breakdown in security in late 1998.
Proposed Fourth Education Project
6.11   A Fourth Education Project (FY'01), which is under preparation, will seek to assist the
GOSL to rehabilitate the education sector in the medium term. Its objectives will include:
(i) defining and implementing a policy framework conducive to cost-effective financing of the
education system and to increasing access by and retention of students; (ii) strengthening the
managerial and pedagogical capacity of the sector in order to progressively improve resource
mobilization, allocative efficiency, administration and quality; and (iii) providing support to the
restoration of service delivery at the district level.
6.12   Project preparation was interrupted by the coup d'6tat and subsequent social unrest and
insecurity that, in tur, has led to a further deterioration of the education sector's capacity to
deliver services. In response, the Government and IDA will re-evaluate their strategy for the
education sector and explore new approaches to support the education sector in a post-conflict
situation, including the possibility for a Learning and Innovation Credit (LIL), focusing, in
particular, on transition related issues such as strengthening education sector management at
central and decentralized levels, increased cooperation with private providers and stakeholders,
and pre- and in-service teacher training (including the need for special counseling of traumatized
youth). If feasible, a LIL could support an innovative approach and provide opportunities for
intensive monitoring and learning. The experience gained could then inform the proposed larger-
scale Education IV Project.
6.13   IDA will further assist the efforts to restore the education system and reduce illiteracy
through the CRRP, which will include support to rehabilitate community level infiastructure,
including schools, and re-establishing provision of basic education services.

Youth in Crises Project
6.14   Ihis project, which is financed under the Development Grant Facility in the amount of
USS250,000, became effective in September, 1998 and is being implemented by the NGO
ActionAid, in cooperation with UNICEF, Conciliation Resources and the Ministry of Education.
Disenfranchised Sierra Leonean youth have filled the ranks of the RUF, greatly contributed to
destruction following the coup in 1997, and have long been seen by Government and its
development partners as a potential impediment to peace and stability. The purpose of the grant
is to support a participatory consultative process and pilot reconstruction activities with youth that
will support specifically define at-risk groups through a range of education, training,
employment, health and recreation schemes. As the project was defined in the context of the
emergency situation and directly addresses one of the identified target groups of the CRRP, it will
support the CRRP by identifying potential support strategies for youth.

7. THE MACRO-ECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
Background and Introduction
7.1    By the late 1980's, Sierra Leone faced widespread poverty following nearly two decades
of economic mismanagement. To address this problem, the government initiated an economic
recovery program in late-1989 which sought to correct large macroeconomic imbalances and
undertake structural reforms. In order to reestablish normal relations with external donors and
creditors, the government adopted a rights accmulation program (RAP) with the International
Monetary Fund in 1992. A Reconstruction Import Credit (RIC) was extended by the World Bank
in 1992, followed by a Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) in 1993 as well as various sectoral
credits. Stabilization gais were achieved and the groundwork was laid for major structural
reforms, which brought renewed support from bilateral and multilateral donors. Upon completion
of the RAP, Sierra Leone adopted a three-year Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF)
arrangement in March 1994.
7.2   Following large stabilization gains, the economy once again experienced a positive rate
of growth in 1994 (Table 7.1). However, in early 1995, fighting between government and RUF
forces escalated. The RUF overran the rutide and bauxite mines in January 1995, which at the
time accounted for nearly 70 percent of Sierra Leone's official exports and 17 percent of
government revenue. The spread of RUF attacks outside the eastern and southern provinces led
to a fiuther large displacement of the population, loss in agricultural output, and disruption to
major transport links. The heightening of the conflict was also a setback to macroeconomic
stability. Inflation on a year-to-year basis jumped from 22 percent in 1994 to 35 percent in 1995.
Likewise, the Leone depreciated by more than 50 percent. The loss of mining output and
displacement of persons from firming activities led to a decline in real GDP by an estimated
10 percent.

7.3   The Government's position strengthened somewhat in 1996 when it resorted to the use of
the services of external military contractors to combat the rebels. The security situation improved
correspondingly, and the economy began to show signs of recovery. Following multiparty
elections in February and March 1996, prospects for economic recovery were bolstered by the
new Government's commitment to macroeconomic stability and structural reform. As a result,
real GDP is estimated to have grown by 5 percent in 1996 on the strength of a rebound in
agricultural output and alluvial diamond mining activity. Inflation fell to 6 percent and the
exchange rate remained stable. However, the key rutile and bauxite mining operations did not
reopen as hoped for in 1996. As a result, the current account deficit (excluding grants) increased
from 17.5 percent of GDP in 1994 to 21 percent in 1996. Nevertheless, the Bank of Sierra Leone
was able to achieve a modest increase in gross international reserves to the equivalent of
1.5 months of imports, largely as a result of donor inflows.
7.4   The process of reconstruction was brought to an abrupt halt by the coup d'6tat staged by a
handful of junior military officers in May 1997. There was a complete breakdown in the security
situation, leading to increased lawlessness, destruction of property, and massive displacement of
the population. Economic activity came to a virtual standstill with most businesses remaining
closed after being looted. As a result, unemployment, already high before the coup, soared
fiuther. Real GDP is estimated to have contracted by over 20 percent in 1997. Government
finances deteriorated during the course of 1997 against the backdrop of a virtual cessation in
mining revenues, a sharp reduction in customs revenues due to a trade embargo, and mounting
expenditures on generally non-productive activities. The budget deficit on a commnitment basis
increased to 7.4 percent of GDP compared to 6.3 percent of GDP in 1996. In the absence of
external financing and a lack of domestic market for government debt instruments, public
expenditures were funded largely by central bank financing. Inflation, which was about 6 percent
on an annual basis at the time of the coup, surged to about 100 percent during the junta rule.
Severe foreign exchange shortage as a result of cessation in mining activity and in donor-financed
project and program aid led to a nearly 100 percent depreciation of the exchange rate, to over
Le. 1,600 to the US Dollar.
7.5   The resolution of the crisis provided the opportnity for the restoration of normal
economic activity.  The Government resumed the implementation of its Resettlement,
Rehabilitation, and Reconstruction (RRR) Program that received donor support at the
Consultative Group meeting in March 1997 and that was reaffirmed with the return of the
Government in March 1998. Furthermore, the Government re-launched the consultative process
with a wide spectrum of civil society to elicit their input into a national development strategy for
poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth. The main themes that emerged out of this
Strategic Planning and Action Process (SPP) were: (i) creating a unified, peaceful nation with
good governance; (ii) creating a strong, stable, and growing economy; and (iii) creating a nation
of healthy, capable, and productive citizens.
7.6    After the return of Government in March 1998, economic activity resumed, with real
GDP estimated to have increased by an estimated 1 percent for the year as a whole, after a sharp
decline in 1997. Inflation dropped from 48.7 percent in the first quarter of 1998 to a negative 5.7
percent in the fourth quarter7. Although Government continued to experience serious institutional
capacity constraints with regards to budgetary management, revenue collection rose significantly
7 The macroeconomic information on 1998 and 1999 is largely derived from the IMF Briefing Paper -
Request for Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance, October 1999.



TechnicalAnnex                      Project Title: Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation
Country: Sierra Leone                                                Page 34 of 87
to an estimated 7.5 percent of GDP, from 5.6 percent of GDP in 1997. However, total
expenditures and net lending rose by an estimated 5.5 percent to about 19 percent of GDP.
The overall 1998 budget deficit increased to 11.4 percent of GDP. Financing of the deficit
occurred largely by recourse to domestic borrowing, with net credit to Government rising to an
estimated 26 percent of broad money, which increased by 11 percent. By the end of December
1998, gross external reserves had risen to US$44.1 million and the parallel market premium had
fallen by half to about 13 percent.
7.7   The civil unrest in January 1999 reversed the very modest gains that occurred during
1998. To date (October 1999), it is estimated that real output has fallen by 9 percent since the
beginning of the year. Revenue performance was poor and expenditures and net lending
increased by 90 percent during the first half of 1999 (relative to the outturn for the first part of
1998). The rise in expenditures reflected the impact of a 40 percent wage and salary increase for
Government workers, a rise in external debt service payments and an increase in security outlays.
Financing of the deficit continued to rely heavily on the banking system. The parallel market
exchange rate depreciated by about 35 percent between December 1998 and June 1999, while the
parallel market premium widened to 38 percent.
7.8    After the signing of the Lome Peace Accord, the economic situation is expected to
improve. For the second half of 1999, Government revenue collection is projected to improve
markedly. Expenditures, however, are expected to increase even faster due to outlays on
emergency relief and rehabilitation. The primary budget deficit and the current account deficit
are projected to rise to 7.8 and 12.7 percent respectively. Budgetary assistance from international
donor organizations has increased significantly since July 1999 and amounts to about
US$50 milliong.
Macroeconomic Management
7.9   The Sierra Leonean authorities recopize that the restoration of macroeconomic stability,
especially in the light of huge outlays required in the context of the RRR program, is critical for
building business confidence and eliciting a strong private sector supply response. In view of
this, they are currently elaborating a macroeconomic program with the IMF to ensure that the
macroeconomic imbalances are reduced and that the emergency donor funding would be used
efficiently. The main focus of the Govermnent policies during 2000 will be to elaborate and
initiate macroeconomic and strucural reforms.  The overarching objectives of the new
macroeconomic framework will be to significantly reduce the rate of inflation while permitting a
recovery in economic activity and a reconstitution of gross external reserves. These
macroeconomic objectives will be pursued through prudent fiscal, monetary, as well as external
trade policies in conformity with a market-determined exchange rate. The macroeconomic policy
framework is likely to be developed along the following policy guidelines:
The World Bank fumded Emergency Recovery and Rehabilitation Credit is scheduled to go the Board
before the end-December 1999, and entails US$30 million of balance of payments support.

Fiscal Polies
7.10   The main objectives of the fiscal program in the medium term are to reduce significantly
the overall budget deficit, improve the quality of expenditure, and pursue the social objectives of
the RRR program. The Government recognizes that a reduction in the fiscal deficit is essential to
maintaining price stability and steps are taken to strengthen fiscal discipline. An increased
revenue effort will be undertaken and tight control over spending will be maintained. Previously
initiated measures to strengthen expenditure control and monitoring will be reinforced.
Improvement in revenue mobilization, will come from: (i) an improvement in tax administration,
which will be pursued through the establishment of an independent revenue authority that would
be remunerated on the basis of performance; stricter enforcement in the customs and excise
department; greater monitoring of freight levy; and better collection of revenues from fisheries;
and (ii) changes in the tax structure to improve compliance: this will be approached through
introduction of new income tax legislation that will be geared to a more equitable distribution of
the tax burden and would lower tax rates. Further, the Government is considering measures to
broaden the tax base (with technical assistance from the IMF). Specific fiscal targets are expected
to be set in collaboration with the IMF mission.
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
7.11   The Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) will pursue a monetary policy aimed at substantially
reducing the rate of monetary expansion and lowering inflation in line with the above mentioned
macroeconomic targets. Credit expansion to the private sector is being encouraged. The policy
priority in the financial sector is to ensure that commercial bank portfolios are restructured to
restore profitability and to conform with prudential guidelines. The reform will aim at creating a
more stable and viable financial system by improving banking supervision and oversight by BSL,
expanding available savings instruments, and promoting growth and competition in the provision
of financial services. Specifically, the revised Banking and Bank of Sierra Leone Acts, which are
expected to be introduced in Parliament, should allow for improved banking supervision,
strengthened prudential requirements, increased minimum capital requirements, and appropriate
guidelines for classifying loans and issuing new tradable instruments.
Edernal Sector Polices
7.12 The Government intends to contain the current account deficit within limits that can be
financed through budgetary and balance of payments assistance, and consistent with the
naintenance of a modest level of gross external reserves. The current account deficit is expected
to rise to 16 percent of GDP, while gross reserves are targeted to amount to US$35 million at the
end-December 2000. GOSL will negotiate with extemal creditors to reach agreement on the
outstanding extenal debt service arrears. The current market determined exchange rate will be
mainained and measures will be put in place to narrow the gap between the official and the
parallel market rate.
7.13 On trade policy, the Government will continue to maintain a liberalized trade system,
diversify exports, and promote efficient import substitution activities. The range of duty rates
will be narrowed, with the lowest rate of 5 percent, applied to raw materials, spare parts, plant
and machinery, and essential capital goods, the rate of 20 percent applied to intermediate and
semi-manufactured goods, and the highest rate of 40 percent applied to luxury goods. The tariff
regime will be reviewed to bring it more in line with the unfolding tariff reductions in
neighboring countries. A duty drawback system for non-traditional exports is likely to be

introduced and is expected to have a positive impact with the recovery of exports after the war.
The transparency of Sierra Leone's external trade regime, especially with regard to discretionary
exemptions is expected to be improved following greater scrutiny and stricter monitoring of non-
governmental organizations that are exempt from paying duties. In parallel with the reforms on
the macroeconomic front, the Government is planning to undertake wide-ranging reforms towards
structual change and flexibility in the economy. The Government realizes that much still
remains to be done and it is updating its reform agenda accordingly in the areas of public
enterprise sector restructuring, central administabve reform, private sector development, and
public expenditure management.

8. PROJECT PREPARATION FACILITY
8.1   Following a cease fire between the GOSL and the RUF in April 1996, the Government
formally applied for a PPF Advance, (in the amount of US$400,000) to initiate activities
necessary to prepare the Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation Project to be financed by
IDA. In particular, the advance from the PPF was used to:
* finalize participatory needs assessments and related beneficiary profiling studies;
* complete the detailed design of proposed project components, including; (a) the ERSF
systems and procedures, (b) assessment and initial work needed for the Integrated
Information Center, and (c) the development of a standard package of essential
productive inputs; and
* perform preparatory work to assess and consolidate the existing implementation
capacity of the Ministry of National Reconstruction, ResetUement and Rehabilitation,
including: (a) prepare an implementation manual, and (b) recruit a limited number of
staff with the necessary technical expertise on a contraual basis to allow the
MNRRR to fuilfl its coordination, monitoring and management function at the
Regional level.
8.2    Up until the time of the coup d'etat of 1997, the PPF was managed by MNRRR with
assistance from the IDA-financed Public Sector Management Support Project (CR. 2435-SL).
Supplementary PPF Advance
8.3   By May 1997, the initial PPF advance of US$400,000 had been fully disbursed, mainly
for consultancy services and the procurement of equipment. In response to the signing of the
Peace Agreement in November 1996, and a marked improvement in the security situation, a
supplemental PPF advance of US$1.6 million was requested by the GOSL and approved by IDA
immediately prior to the coup d'etat. At that time, it was proposed that this PPF be used to:
*  help finalize changes in overall project design that put greater emphasis upon the
regional administration and implementation structures; which require resources for
initial operational costs and equipment at regional level, and additional training and
sensitization of MNRRR staff and implementing partners; and
*  initiate pilot activities under the Emergency Recovery Support Fund to identify and
address potential technical and administrative problems which could negatively affect
implementation, and to prepare a "pipeline" of sub-projects to allow rapid start-up of
activities immediately after loan effectiveness.
8.4    Disbursements for all Bank Projects and PPFs were suspended in June 1997 as a result of
the coup; this suspension was only lifted in July 1998. Despite the 11 month interruption, the
purpose of the supplementary PPF advance remained valid and the Government proceeded with
the preparation activities as planned prior to May 1997. Preparatory activities were notably
curtailed following the attack on Freetown in January 1999, however as of October 1999,
approximately US$1.5 million of the total PPF advance of US$2 million, had been expensed or

committed, and the Government was in the process of prepanng contacts with implementing
agencies for pilot ERSF and TEP activities valued at approximately US$145,000.

9. COMMUNITY REINTEGRATION AND
REHABILITATION PROJECT
Project Description
9.1   The Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation Project (CRRP), which seeks
US$25 million equivalent IDA financing, will support the GOSL's emergency recovery programs
(the NRRRP and the NDDRP) by assisting those people and communities most affected by the
past eight years of conflict to rebuild their communities and resume normal productive lives.
The Project will consist of two components: (i) an Emergency Recovery Support Fund (ERSF),
and related institutional support to the NCRRR and partners; and (ii) a Training & Employment
Program (TIEP), and related institutional support to NCDDR and partners.
ERSF and Related Intiutional Suppoit
9.2   The ERSF will facilitate the social and economic recovery of communities and the
restoration of basic social and economic services through demand-driven, community-oriented
projects that target internally displaced persons, refugees and the communities affected by the
conflict of the past eight years. The ERSF will finance sub-projects in the areas of agricultural
rehabilitation, temporary shelter, reconstruction of community infrastructure, establishment of
essential social services, promotion of reconciliation, and local institutional capacity building that
target IDPs, refugees and the communities to which they return. The ERSF wiln also support
labor-intensive urban and rural public works programs that help rehabilitate economic and social
assets, and which provide a temporary social safety net for specifically targeted vulnerable groups
of unemployed youth, ex-combatants, and others. Sub-projects would range in cost from
US$ 10,000 to US$500,000 equivalent, and would be implemented by eligible partners, including
internaonal and national NGOs, line ministry units, existing project units, and community-based
organizations which have adequate capacity.
9.3    As part of the ERSF sub-projects, IDA would finance the cost of equipment and vehicles,
basic agricultural inputs, construction materials, traiing, technical assistance, and essential
operating costs associated with sub-project implementation. In addition, IDA would finance a
portion of the recurrent costs associated with sub-project administration, monitoring and
evaluation on the part of the Government. Detailed and satisfactory systems, procedures,
standardized guidelines and formats have been developed by GOSL and are presented in the
'"ERSF Operational Manual". The African Development Bank will co-finance with IDA the
ERSF, institutional support of NCRRR, and related project management costs under this
component of the CRRP. GOSL is discussing the possibility of additional support to the Fund
with other donor agencies.

9.4   The TEP will support the social and economic reintegration of former combatants
through targeted counseling, training, and employment initiatives. The social reintegration efforts
would include civic education, socio-psychological counseling and community sensitization

activities. Counseling and referrals would prepare ex-combatants for their return to civilian life
and assist them by providing critical psycho-social support during the reintegration phase and by
providing information and opportunities to access available reintegration assistance.
The economic reintegration services would include a vocational orientation, counseling on job-
seeking strategies, information and advice on training and employment opportunities and on
establishing micro-projects. The TEP program would also offer concrete means for linking ex-
combatants to trauning and employment opportunities, including the referral to labor-intensive
public works, broader rehabilitation projects, income generating activities, vocational training and
apprenticeships.
9.5   In the area of vocational training the program would encourage existing training suppliers
to prepare and implement short, modular training courses that correspond to the educational
background and career interests of the ex-combatants (based on a socio-economic profile
compiled at the time of registration), and the needs of the labor market. Skills development will
be provided through a contract training scheme with training providers. Rehabilitation of
vocational training infiastructure would also be required during the pilot phase of the program.
Once training capacity has been re-established, the introduction of voucher programs may be
encouraged to ensure that the training is sufficiently demand-driven and to enable ex-combatants
to purchase the training that will increase their employability. The TEP will also finance training
expenses incurred by artisans who train ex-combatants through informal sector apprenticeships;
tool-kits would be provided upon commencement of the apprenticeship or after completion of the
vocational training to increase the employability of ex-combatants.
9.6   ERSF and TEP activities will be implemented by eligible partners including international
and national NGOs, government line ministry units, existing project units and community-based
organizations where capacity warrants. The sub-project implementation procedures have been
designed through a process of investigation, consultation, and consensus-building initiated by the
Govemment, the World Bank and others in mid-1996. Over a six-month period Government
staff regional authorities, national and international NGOs, and key international agencies and
donors currently involved in the rehabilitation and recovery process were consulted on how best
such a funding mechanism should work. This collaborative process aulminated in a set of
consultative meetings of Ministry staff, NGO representatives and key donors held in November
1996 and May 1997 to finalize these procedures. The result of this consultative process is the
shared understanding of the rationale behind the proposed administrative procedures and a shared
responsibility among the group involved in the process for the successful implementation of the
fund. It is believed that this participatory planning process will help ensure the viability of the
Project.
9.7   The ERSF will rely on a decentralized, bottom-up project planning, approval and
monitoring process which taps into and builds upon existing systems and structures at the
regional and local levels. Implementing partners will be called upon to design sub-projects in
close collaboration with village, section and chiefdom authorities. Regional inter-agency
committees and regional NCRRR and NCDDR staff will oversee individual project selection and
monitoring activities. NCRRR and NCDDR headquarters' staff will provide the broad policy and
program planning fiamework for the CRRP, monitor national CRRP implementation and
coordinate overall recovery efforts. A national level Projects Committee will be constituted to
review and approve sub-projects that are valued at US$50,000, or more, are national in scope, or
that target the Western Area. The TEP will utilize a standard requests for proposal system as well
as a demand-driven project identification process similar to the ERSF to select and finance
reintegration sub-projects for ex-combatants. Regional Reintegration Offices will evaluate

beneficiary-intiated project proposals and a central-level committee consisting of NCDDR staff,
the Reintegration Unit Manager, and representatives of the Ministry of Labor, the business
community, and implementing agencies will review and approve proposals submitted to the TEP.
9.8    The Project Summary Table presented in Attachment 3 of this Technical Annex provides
a narrative summary of the Project, presents its key monitoring indicators, identifies the means to
be used in measuring its performance, and highlights the critical assumptions underlying the
Project's design. The systems, procedures, and responsibilities particular to the ERSF and the
TEP are summarized in Section 12 of this Technical Annex, and are described in detail in the
respective operational manuals, which are contained in the Project file.
Project Costs and Financing
9.9   The total esfimated costs for the CRRP is US$54.34 million, of which IDA will finance
US$25.0 million equivalent. The African Development Bank/Fund will co-finance the first
component of the Project related to the ERSF and support to the NCRRR  DFID, while not a
formal co-financier of the CRRP, has committed approximately US$13 muilion equivalent in
support of the Project's second component, the TEP and related institutional support to NCDDR
Counterpart contributions from GOSL, implementing agencies and communities that will receive
support under the ERSF and TEP are estimated at US$4.1 million equivalent. The two tables

Areas of CRRP Activity
9.10 In line with the overall objectives of the NRRRP and the NDDRP, the CRRP will support
interventions and sub-projects which address the following broad sectors and areas of activity:
*     Agricultural  Rehabilitation:  including   support  to   basic   productive   activities
(primarily through the provision of seeds, tools and emergency food supply for the
farming season); support to rehabilitation of tree crops, other cash crops, fishing
(through the provision of equipment) and animal husbandry (through re-stocking of
animals);
*     Shelter: principally  to  provide temporary  structures and  to  provide the  planning
framework for permanent facilities;
* Rehabilitation of Community Infrastructure: to support the rehabilitation of schools,
health  centers, court barmes  (traditional vi1lage  admnitatve  structure), water
supply, roads, nrual market-places and other priority structures as identified by
communities;
*   Re-establishment of Essential Services: to provide human and material resources
essential to the re-establishment of basic health and education services in
collaboration with the relevant ministries;
*   Reintegration  of Vulnerable  Groups: supporting  the  social and  economic
reintegration of specific groups (e.g., widows, female head of households, ex-
combatants, children affected by the war and disabled people) into communities;
which may include temporary safety nets, community sensitization, vocational
training capital/credit, counselingftrauma healing, information, employment
(e.g. labor-intensive public works), education and/or functional literacy;
*   Promotion of Reconciliation: for programs promoting reconciliation and conflict
resolution at the community level; which may include developing conflict resolution

skills, promoting reconciliation through local media, supporting youth, community
and voluntary associations with the potential for promoting reconciliation;
*  Small Enterprise Promotion and Vocational Training Schemes: designed to support
development of productive skills among individual target group members
(particularly ex-combatants) and to promote income generating activities at
community level;
* Public works program targeting unemployed groups in the poorest sections of
Freetown, provincial capitals and for rural reconstruction in areas such as:
environmental sanitation and waste disposal, road repair and maintenance, public
buildings maintenance, urban reforestation, etc.; and
* Capacity-Building: of local organizations in all of the above areas the development.
Geographic and Beneficiary Targeting
9.11   The CRRP will be active throughout the regions and districts of Sierra Leone which have
been affected by the war. Priority will be given to supporting populations returning to rural areas,
and for those areas most severely affected by the war.
9.12   The CRRP will coordinate closely with other recovery activities (e.g. the European
Comnmission's Resettlement and Rehabilitation Program, line-ministry emergency plans, NGO
initiatives, etc.) so as to avoid duplication and overlap in areas of operation. The procedures for
sub-projec review and approval will also support similar sub-project activities financed by the
ADB-supported Social Action and Poverty Alleviation (SAPA) Program, which is also managed
by NCRRR.
9.13   To be eligible for consideration, any sub-project proposal presented to the CRRP must
target one of the following groups: (i) people in war-affected villages who never moved but are
takin initiatives to re-establish themselves and their communities; (ii) people returning
sotaneously to their villages from displaced camps, bush camps and other areas; (iii) vulnerable
groups, such as female headed households, children affected by the conflict through being
orphaned, war trana or disrupted schooling, and disabled people, including those severely
injured or trumatzed by the war; (iv) ex-combatants and their dependents; and (v) urban
unemployed.
Institutional Support to NCRRR and NCDDR
9.14   The National Commission for Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation is charged
with coordinating and monitoring the NRRRP. While NCRRR is a temporary institution, it is
also newly established and requires support to effectively carry out its mandate, particularly in
relation to the CRRP. Therefore, the proposed Project would strengthen NCRRR's efforts to
coordinate, monitor and facilitate implementation of priority recovery activities through the
provision of essential goods, equipment and support of recurrent costs for central and regional
offices. In addition, the Credit would finance technical assistance in the areas of financial
management, procurement, auditing, management information systems, ERSF implementation
assistance, and project evaluation. IDA will share the cost of supporting NCRRR with the AfDB,
UNDP and the Government.
9.15   The National Committee on Disannament, Demobilization and Reintegration (NCDDR)
is also a newly established governmental institution with a- temporary mandate of three years.



TechnicalAnnex                      Project Title: Community Reintegration andRehabilitation
Country: Sierra Leone                                                Page 44 of 87
The Executive Secretariat (ES) of the NCDDR is the implementing arm of the National
Committee, and it will require core operational support to be able to fully carry out its mandate.
The Bank, at the request of the Government, has provided advice and techimcal assistance to help
develop the NDDRP, and to operationalize the ES. It is proposed that the Project continue to
support technical assistance for the Program in the areas of social and economic reintegration,
community sensitization, management information systems, and financial management. It was
agreed with Government that this last area of assistance would be shared with NCRRR (in the
form of the FMPU). The Credit would also finance essential core investment and recurrent costs
of the central and regional offices of the NCDDR IDA would provide this support in close
collaboration with DFUD and other potential donors such as the German government.
Existing Instutional Support
9.16   Several donor agencies have provided essential institutional support to both NCRRR and
NCDDR. Prior to the coup, the UNDP had entered into a 2-year capacity building program with
MNRRR to ensure the effective delivery of demobilization, reintegration, rehabilitation and
recovery activities. UNDP is now supporting NCRRR through its Preventive Development
Program. The UK's Overseas Development Agency provided essential material and personnel
support specifically for demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants prior to the coup, and
DFID is curntly the main donor supporting DDR activities. The Islamic Development Bank
established a Project Implementation Unit in MNRRR prior to the coup, and the ADB is also
assisting NCRRR through the SAPA Program, which has been reoriented to more closely support
the national recovery efforts. The UN Humanitrn Affairs Coordination Unit assisted the
former Ministry, and UN-OCHA now works closely with NCRRR, to help the Government to
fill its information collection, monitoring and coordination role.
9.17 Notwithstanding the assistance of these donor organizations, NCRRR and NCDDR still
require funding for core staff positions, critical equipment, and basic logistical support to fully
carry out their institutional mandates and to effectively implement the Community Reintegration
and Rehabilitation Project. Therefore, IDA proposes supporting those functions and units which
are seen as essential to the successful Project implementation. The specific nature of this support
is described below; detailed cost tables for the Project are shown in Attachment 3 to this
document.
Project Supportfor the Central Level
9.18   As noted above, NCRRR and NCDDR have received important institutional support from
several donors to set up the central level systems and hire personnel to coordinate and monitor
national program activities. However, basic operating support for central and field-level
activities, supplies, technical assistance, and essential staff training and development are absent
from most of these efforts. Given the ambitious program of activities being planned by both
government and NGOs, and the positive responses of donor countries and organizations to
supporting the two programs, the challenges which NCRRR and NCDDR face are significant and
are growing rapidly. It is clear to all donor agencies involved with NCRRR and NCDDR that
firther support is required for the institutions to adequately fulfill their mandates.



TechnicalAnnex                      Project Title: Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation
Country: Sierra Leone                                                 Page 45 of 87
9.19 Tberefore, to ensure the effective operation under the CRRP, IDA will provide
incremental support to the three central-level technical (non-project specific) units of NCRRR9.
This support will cover essential operating costs associated with planning, managing, monitoring
and coordinating the ERSF (including local consultant fees, per diem and travel costs, fuel, minor
equipment, and basic supplies). The Project will fund necessary technical assistance to develop a
computerized monitoring and evaluation system and to assess the impact of selected sub-projects,
and inputs needed to produce and disseminate sensitization messages via modem and traditional
media outlets. Finally, the credit will be used to finance the Project's financial audits and for the
technical advisor to the ERSF. Similarly, the Project will also finance necessary equipment,
personnel, operating costs and technical assistance to the Executive Secretariat to the NCDDR to
ensure the effective coordination of the NDDRP.
Projet Supportfor tke Regional Levels
9.20 In the process of preparing the project, the Government and its development partners
emphasized the need to decentralize decision making, build local level capacity and encourage
community participation in the overall recovery process. Furthermore, all stakeholders involved
n the preparation and appraisal of the CRRP specifically expressed strong support for the
decentralization of the Project's management functions in helping redress the Freetown bias of
previous Government led development efforts.
9.21   The Project as a whole will have a strong regional focus and a large portion of the
technical and administrative decisions for the Project will be taken at this level. Therefore, it is
essential to the success of the CRRP that adequate systems, procedures, staff and logistical
support are available at regional level to undertake these responsibilities. Unfortnately, NCRRR
and NCDDR's initial focus on establishing the central directorates has cost the regional offices
their share of support and the limited staff and logistical support currently in place in the regions
is funded entirely from the PPF for the Project. Therefore, in order to ensure the efficient
operation of the CRRP, and the overall effectiveness of NCRRR and NCDDR at regional level,
IDA will support the regional offices of both institutions in terms of essential staff, necessary
equipment and vehicles for monitoring field activities, and operating costs associated with travel,
fuel, basic supplies and office rents.
9.22   The Project will also provide support to local non-governmental implementing partners in
the areas of project proposal development, financial management, and project implementation to
strengthen local institutional capacity to more fully participate in the CRRP and the national
recovery program in general. IDA will share these cost of strengthening NCRRR, NCDDR and
local implementing partners with UNDP, AfDB and DFID.

10. STUDIES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
Preparatory Studies Completed
10.1 The studies and consultancies described below have been undertaken by and on behalf of
Govemment in order to facilitate the preparation of the CRR.
Social and Economic Reintegration andResource Management: A Study on Conflict
andReconciiaion.
10.2  This qualitative study examined three main issues: (i) potential conflict over land and
land based resources in the context of large scale civilian resettlement; (ii) community
perceptions of the demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants; and (iii) operational
strategies to revitalize and support the capacities of community structures to deal with conflict
resolution. The analysis indicated that the displaced felt that there would be very little conflict
over land allocation, with the possible exception of areas with tree crops where resettlement
needs would have to be coordinated closely by local authorities.
10.3  Regarding the demobilization and reintegration of ex-ombatants, interviews undertaken
revealed that while some recognize the need for reconciliation others were fearfil about having
ex-combatants in their communities. These fears could be allayed if a proper community
sensitization process is implemented to inform people about the scope and coverage of the
demobilization and reintegration process. The study further examines operational strategies to re-
establish and support the capacities of community structures to deal with conflict resolution. A
significant reform of the judicial system was recommended, as well as a sensitization process, at
the local judiciary level and among paramount chiefs.
Reintegration of War-Affected Youth and Ex-Combatants: A Study of the Social and
Economic Opportunity Structure in Sierra Leone.
10.4  This study, undertaken in October 1996, assessed the motivation and needs of war-
affected youth and ex-combatants and analyzed social and economic opportunity structures
currently existing in Sierra Leone. The study highlights that:
i. most young people have become entrapped by the fighting rather than volunteering
for action;
ii. the total numbers of irregular combatants are not that large, and therefore
demobilization could be relatively straightforward; and
iii. hard core RUF combatants, particularly those with a track record for violent
atrocities, fear that they will become targets for civilian revenge. However, many
combatants spoke of a desire to be reunited with their families and to retum to
school or complete disrupted education.

Socio-Economic Survey of theArmed Forces of the Republic of Sierra Leone
10.5   A socio-economic survey of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Sierra Leone (AFRSL)
was undertaken between December 1996 and January 1997 to gather statistically useful data on
the needs, characteristics and aspirations of nilitary personnel with a view to informing the
design of Government reintegration measures. Quantitative data was supplemented by qualitative
information gathered in focus group discussions, which sought further information on needs and
the civilian aspirations of AFRSL personnel. The main findings of the survey were that:
i.  AFRSL personnel are predominately male (98.1%), under thirty years of age
(56.2%), and married (96%);
ii. the majority of the forces (61.8%) have only served for up to 5 years;
iii. education rates are relatively high by Sierra Leone standards (only 29.2% had never
been to school, and 30% had completed secondary education);
iv. if discharged, over 75% of members of the AFRSL would return to their home
communities, where they expected that family members would be the main source of
initial assistance; and
v. the lack of employment opportunities was cited by 54.9% of those interviewed as
being the major concem upon demobilization.  Respondents also identified
professional training as a vital need after demobilization. Some respondents
expressed a wish for agricultural tuining.
10.6 GOSL will augment these findings with the data currently being collected as part of the
DDR registration process underway at Lungi Camp, as the Government designs appropriate
reintegration strategies.
Consultancies Undertaken to Prepare the Project
10.7   A number of other consultancies were also undertaken in preparing the Project, which are
described below.
Design of the ERSF
10.8  Three separate missions were carried out by the US NGO, Planning Assistance, to help
the Government to define the implementation procedures for the ERSF and prepare the Project's
Operational Manual. The missions relied on in-depth consultations with potential implementing
partners at the central and regional levels and a review of World Bank and other donor best
practices in setting up and operating similar social-fund type projects. The final design of the
ERSF was the result of thorough negotiations between Government, NGOs and key stakeholders
to arrive at a decentralized implementation mechanism which relied on existing regional inter-
agency coordination structures. The final phase of the work involved the conduct of regional
workshops with potential implementing partners to initiate sub-project proposal development, and
assistance to the ERSF regional structures to begin the process of sub-project review, evaluation
and approval. As part of the August 1998, post-appraisal mission, assistance was also provided to
help the Government review and update the operational systems and procedures, and to
accommodate the ERSF co-financing arrangement with the AfDB.

Integrated Information Center (IIC)
10.9  The feasibility of an infonnation sharing mechanism that would strengthen the ability of
GOSL to coordinate and monitor the vanous demobilization, reintegration, resettlement and
rehabilitation activities, was appraised during an identification mission in September 1996 by two
US NGOs, Volunteers in Technical Assistance (VITA) and Response Net. The Integrated
Information Center was conceived of to facilitate the flow of information between UN Agencies,
NGOs and GOSL ministries, and would provide several different services to its users, including:
(i) private e-mail accounts; (ii) a conferencing feature; and (iii) a medium for sharing reports and
maps. The IIC system uses a sophisticated communication software (Mustang Wildcat 5) which
runs on a single PC, serving as a host. Users connect via modems, but the capacity exists in the
software to expand to include wireless communication and to allow for network access. The UC
can be utilized by all personnel and organizations involved in humanitarian, reconstruction and
rehabilitation work in Sierra Leone. Access for line ministries is also planned. UNDP is currently
assisting NCRRR to reactivate the Center which is currently out of service, but which remained
physically intact throughout the coup and its aftermath.
Technical Assistancefor the DDR Program
10.10 Within the context of the DDR reintegration program, technical assistance is being
provided to assist the Executive Secretariat of the NCDDR in the planning and design of the
reintegration activities for the ex-combatants. IDA has supported the Secretariat through PPF and
PHRD grant resources with a team of international experts in the areas of social reintegration,
economic reintegration and community sensitization. As of July 1999, this support is being
financed by DFID through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund established and managed by the World
Bank. The social reintegration specialist will assist DDR in the planning and design of programs
for (i) civic education; (ii) socio-psychological counseling; and (iii) pre-discharge orientation.
The economic integration specialist will assist DDR in the planning and design of training and
employment activities. The community sensitization specialist will assist DDR in the planning
and design of an information and sensitization campaign targeting former combatants, intended
communities of retum, and a nationwide audience. Finally, an assessment of potential labor-
intensive public works activities was carried out in order to identify specific activities and
implementing partners that could facilitate the reintegration of ex-combatants.
Monitoring and Evaluaion
10.11 A robust Management and Evaluation System will be required to track and analyze
periodic data on Project inputs, outputs and outcomes, and to evaluate the impact of Project
strtegies on the overall development objectives of the National DDR and RRR Programs. While
both NCRRR and NCDDR have established the structures and are in the process of hiring the
personnel which will have responsibility for collecting and maintaining the relevant information,
the appropriate M&E systems are not yet designed. NCDDR has received preliminary assistance
in the design of an M&E system, and will receive further support from both international experts
and local systems designers in carrying out, entering and analyzing the first set of data from the
Phase l(a) demobilization exercise. NCRRR will receive similar technical assistance under the
PPF, or through a bilateral agreement with DFID. It is expected that on-going technical support
will also be required for both institutions during Project implementation from the national
systems designer consultant, and the international consultant in survey design, implementation
and data analysis.

Technical Assistance Required under the Project
Finwcial Management and Procurement Unit (FMtPU
10.12 Based on an analysis of current capacities within Government, and an assessment of
alternative options, it was agreed with Government that a separate unit be formed and charged
with all financial management and procurement responsibilities under the CRRP. It was further
agreed with Government that this unit would be set up and managed by a capable firm that would
be contracted through intemational tendering procedures. Detailed Terms of Reference for the
FMPU and its key staff were prepared, discussed and agreed upon by the GOSL, AflDB and the
World Bank prior to negotiations. Employment of a suitable firm to set up and operate the FMPU
will be a condition of credit effectiveness.
10.13 The FMPU will ensure that all contracting, procurement, disbursement and financial
management functions required under the two national programs are carried out in accordance
with standard and accepted guidelines of the donor agencies supporting these two programs.
The FMPU will prepare all financial management reports, payments requests, and other
documentation required of the Commission and Committee by the GOSL and donor agencies.
The Unit will also be responsible for overseeing the Special and Project Accounts, maintaining
adequate documentation of financial transactions, and initiating payments for all Project contracts
which have been authorized by NCRRR and NCDDR The Unit Manager will report to NCRRR,
NCDDR and MOFDEP in the execution of these functions. The draft organizational chart, teins
of reference and detailed job descriptions for FMPU staff are shown in Attachment 4.
TechnicalAssistance to the ERSF
10.14  Due to the innovative nature of the ERSF, and the limited in-country experience with
such social fund-type mechanisms, Govermnent will also seek assistance in the form of a
technical advisor to the ERSF, initially for 12 months, to: (i) provide key institutional support for
the operationalization of the Fund; (ii) work closely with regional ERSF staff in sub-project
appraisal and institutional assessment techniques; (iii) assist and train NCRRR central-level staff
in Fund management and monitoring; (iv) help ensure timely flow of approved resources for
ERSF implementation to both NCRRR units and sub-project implementing partners; (v) provide
guidance to NCRRR in assisting implementing partners on proposal development, sub-project
implemnentation, monitoring, evaluation, etc.; and (vi) assist NCRRR to revise and update
systems, procedures, etc. as and when needed to ensure efficient and effective ERSF
implementation. Draft terms of reference for the position are presented in Attachment 6.
TechnicalAssistance to DDR
10.15 Given the unique nature and sensitivity of the DDR program, and the fict that little in-
country expertise exists in the critical areas of responsibility of NCDDR, it is expected that the
Executive Secretariat will require substantial technical assistance support particularly during the
rapid and complex start-up phase of the Program. At present, it is proposed that four long-term
advisors (of 12 months each) would support each of the line units of the ES/NCDDR in the areas
of reintegration, information and sensitization, monitoring and evaluation, and disannament and
demobilization. Nonetheless, given the dynamic environment in which the DDR Program is
operating, the on-going consultant services needs of this component the Project will be reviewed
and updated after six months of implementation. IDA will support part of the costs of the

reintegraion, information and sensitization, and monitonng and evaluation consultancies
(draft terms of reference for which are presented in Annex 7), while it is expected that DFID
would finance the disarmament and demobilization advisor.
FwancialAudik
10.16 It has been agreed that the proposed project be audited semi-annually by an independent
public accounting firm acceptable to IDA. Given the decentralized nature of the project, and the
many implementing partners contemplated under the Project, semi-annual audits will provide the
NCRRR and NCDDR with valuable and timely management informaton and help ensure
accountability and tansparency. Draft terms of reference for the semi-annually audit are
included as Attachment 8.

11. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
11.1  The implementation structures, responsibilities and specific institutional arrangements for
the Emergency Recovery Support Fund are detailed in the Project's Operational Manual
developed during Project preparation and appraisal, and updated at the time of post-appraisal.
The Operational Manual specifies the roles and responsibilities of both NCRRR and its
implementing partners to access and monitor the use of funds available under the ERSF The
manual, contained in the Project File, also provides the standard forms, guidelines, evaluation
critena and contacts for implementation of the Fund. A similar operational manual for the TEP
has been prepared, is being piloted during the Project's preparation phase, and will be updated
once the Project becomes effective. All other procurement and disbursement procedures and
responsibilities for the institutional support components of the Project will abide by the relevant
standard World Bank and IDA guidelines as specified in the Development Credit Agreement for
the Project.
Implementation Structures
11.2 The GOSL has given the responsibility of overseeing the CRRP to NCRRR and NCDDR.
While these two institutions will coordinate and monitor the CRRP, partner organizations such as
NGOs, line ministry units, parastatal organimzations and community based organizations will be
responsible for implementing specific activities under the Project. The Commissioner, NCRRR,
and the Executive Secretary, NCDDR, will be directly responsible to the World Bank for the use
of Project resources and will jointly report to IDA on the performance of the Project.
11.3 The Project relies on a decentralized implementation structure. NCRRR will have
12 district offices staffed with 3 technicians who will promote community participation and
monitor implementation of ERSF subprojects. It is proposed that, at regional level, NCRRR and
NCDDR will have a joint regional offices (one in each of the provincial capitals; Bo, Kenema and
Makeni, and one in Freetown/Waterloo for Western Area); each staffed with five to six technical
personnel per institution. The regional offices and personnel will coordinate CRRP activities
with regional line ministry offices, NGOs, and other implementing partners; participate in the
approval of ERSF and TEP sub-projects; and report on Project implementation to the national
level offices.
11.4  At national level, NCRRR has three technical units responsible for supporting the CRRP;
the Directorate of Programming and Coordination, the Directorate of Planning, Monitoring and
Evaluation, and the Information and Sensitization Unit. NCDDR has four technical units
responsible for overseeing activities under the CRRP, namely Disarmament and Demobilization,
Reinsertion and Reintegration, Information and Sensitization, and the Monitoring and Evaluation
Units. Each unit is headed up by an experienced and qualified professional who is supported by
one to three technical officers.
11.5  The IDA Credit will help to finance core investment and recurrent costs for both NCRRR
and NCDDR at central and regional levels to facilitate the day-to-day management of the
respective components of the Project. These costs for NCRRR will be shared with UNDP and
AfDB, while costs for NCDDR will be shared with DFID and other interested donors.

Country: Sierra Leone                                                Page 52 of 87
Due to weaknesses in local, in-country, capacities resulting from the coup and prolonged civil
service decline, and taking into consideration the temporary nature of both the NCRRR and
NCDDR, Government will delegate responsibility for the Project's financial management and
procurement functions to a separate and autonomous unit to be contracted through international
competitive bidding procedures. This unit, to be known as the Financial Management and
Procurement Unit (FMPU), will manage all procurement for NCRRR and the Executive
Secretariat of NCDDR, be responsible for all contracting and disbursements under the Project,
oversee management of the local Multi-Donor Trust Fund account, and ensure proper record
keeping and reporting for the Credit in accordance with appropriate World Bank guidelines.
Project Coordination
11.6  Project Coordination will be achieved through several existing mechanisms operational at
national and regional levels. First, there are general coordinating institutions, such as the
Consultative Forum at national level, and the Inter-agency Forums at regional levels. Both of
these structures, which are described in more detail in Chapter 4, serve a particularly important
role in the CRRP. The Consultative Forum helps to coordinate activities across sectoral lines and
between NGOs and line ministries with NCRRR. This is particularly relevant in the emergency
recovery activities where rapid technical responses call for integrated information and
public/private cooperation. This Forum meets fortnightly and is chaired by NCRRR. Regional
Inter-agency Forums (IAF) serve to keep the CRRP in close contact with the key implementing
partners at regional level, and to provide a forum to discuss and resolve local level
implementation concerns or to respond to emergencies. The IAFs will also help in the initial
review of ERSF sub-project proposals to ensure appropriate targeting and avoid overlap or
conflict with other implementing partners. The LAF also meets fortnightly and is chaired by the
Regional Coordinator of NCRRR.
11.7  Secondly, there are technically specialized inter-agency bodies that will contribute to
improving Project coordination and implementation. These bodies, such as the Committee on
Food Aid, the Child Protection Committee, and the Health and Nutrition Committee, exist at both
national and regional levels, are composed of the relevant line ministry and NGOs active in the
given technical area, and liaise with the general coordination bodies at the different levels. These
institutions will serve the Project in two ways; by establishing and enforcing technical norms or
standards in the given technical area concerned, and, possibly, as sub-project evaluators.
11.8  In-country, the exceptionally high and constructive level of coordination exhibited in
Sierra Leone is the result of a strong working relationship that the UN Office for the Coordination
of Humanitarian Affairs has established with the Government and the NGO community. It is
expected that UN/OCHA will continue to play a critical role in supporting and facilitating this
type of coordination to the benefit the Project.
11.9   On the international level, the Government has taken important steps to improve
coordination with its development partners. For instance, the International Contact Group (ICG)
was established following the UN special meeting on Sierra Leone in July 1998. Chaired by
DPID, the ICG strives to assist the Government to consolidate support for the DDR phase of its
national program. In addition, the Government has requested that the World Bank establish a
Multi-Donor Trust Fund that will be used to facilitate financing of DDR-relatd activities by
interested donor countries and organizations. This formal consultative body and administrative
mechanism will greatly enhance the level of coordination between Government and



TechnicalAnnex                      Project Title: Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation
Country: Sierra Leone                                                 Page 53 of 87
its development partners that, in turn, will help to ensure more efficient use of resources during
project and program implementation.
Project Monitoring
11.10 Performance monitoring of the CRRP will focus on two distinct levels: first, at overall
program level for the NRRRP and the NDDRP (i.e., the development objectives, outcomes and
core assumptions and preconditions as shown in the Project's Summary Table contained in
Attachment 3), and second, at detailed Project component and activity level (outputs,
implementation, managerial efficiency, and detailed progran assumptions- again indicated in the
Project Summary Table). This table is a Logical Framework matrix that includes a detailed list of
performance indicators for program objectives and outcomes, Project outputs and inputs, and core
assumptions and related risks. These indicators will be used to measure the performance of the
NDDRP and NRRRP, as well as the CRRP. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Systems will be
established at the NCRRR and the Executive Secretariat of the NCDDR The two systems will be
developed using the same software platform, and be compatible in terms of coding of basic data.
Thus it will be possible to follow ex-combatants from the targeted program (i.e., the NDDRP) to
the broad-based program (i.e., NRRRP).
i 1.11  The M&E system of NCRRR will be designed to allow the Commission to (i) analyze the
effectiveness of the ERSF review process; (ii) quantify sub-project outputs by sector, by region,
and by beneficiary type - including ex-combatants - and gender; (iii) assess level and quality of
community and local institutional participation in sub-project design and implementation; and
(iv) measure the impact of assistance in terms of increased agricultural production, expansion of
social services, increased economic activity, and strengthening of community institutions. The
M&E system of the NCDDR will enable the Executive Secretariat to, among others: (i) establish
detailed, gender desegregated, socioeconomic baselines/profiles; (ii) trace overtime participation
of individual ex-combatants in the DDRP (reception of assistance package, participation
orientation, taining and reintegration activities); (iii) assess implementation efficiency;
(iv) assess the level of social and economic reintegation of ex-combatants.
11.12 The Project will monitor the institutional strengthening of NCRRR and NCDDR in
several ways. First, Government will report on the delivery of all identified Project-financed
inputs as part of the quarterly statements of accounts and progress reports. Government will also
review and analyze progress made in implementing work plans (shown in Attachment 8) as part
of the quarterly progress reports. The Project will also monitor how quickly key Project staff
have been hired, and the respective regional offices operationalized. Timely submission of all
Project related reports (quarterly statements of accounts, semi-annual progress reports, and semi-
annual audit reports) will also serve as a measure of institutional capacity. The successful
operation of the FMPU will be judged based on the quarterly consultancy reports to be provided
by the contacted firm; the timeliness and accuracy of SOE's, payment requests, and other
applications and withdrawals; the quality of procurement documentation submitted for IDA non-
objection; and the efficiency of the procurement process. Finally, general Project implementation
will be judged based on the semi-annual audits reports and the qualified observations, if any,
therein.
11.13 The successful establishment and operation of both the ERSF and the TEP will be also be
closely monitored. Both are innovative implementation stategies and based on several critical
assumptions that need.to be verified. For instance, the degree to which inter-agency bodies and
technical commitees will effectively serve in sub-project review, the level of community



TechnicalAnnex                      Project Title: Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation
County: Sierra Leone                                                 Page 54 of 87
involvement in sub-project design, and local NGO capacity for sub-project implementation are
areas where certain assumptions need to be tested. These issues will be analyzed in detail as part
of a comprehensive review planned for the Project following the six-month pilot phase. The
Govemment will also report to the Bank on other sub-project implementation indicators such as
the amount of time it takes from proposal submission to Projects Committee review to contracting
(in the case of successful proposals); level of committed finds; number and gender of direct sub-
project beneficiaries; numbers and value of sub-projects by sectoral and geographic area, and type
of implementing partner to determine if any biases exist in sub-project selection; and average lag-
time for authorized sub-project disbursements.
11.14 Beyond the Project's institutional structures and implementation mechanisms, the
Government will also tack and report on the output and impact indicators specific to the sub-
projects being financed under the Project. For instance, basic data on agricultural rehabilitation
and production, refurbishment of infiastructure and delivery of basic services, reconstruction of
economic assets and revival of productive activities, and rebuilding of social institutions will be
collected through the Project's monitoring system. These data will, over time, indicate to both the
Government and the Bank if the Project is achieving its general objectives.
11.15 Each implementing agency (NGO, line ministry, etc.) will be responsible for providing
the regional NCRRR and NCDDR offices with information on monthly sub-project outputs in
either computerized or written form. This data will be consolidated at the regional level,
reviewed by the regional ERSF Comnittee and respective institution, and sent forward to the
central level monitoring units of either NCRRR or NCDDR for analysis and reporting to funding
agencies. The form and substance of this sub-project monitoring infornation will be defined as
part of the formal contract entered into between the Government and the implementing partner.
11.16  The Directorate of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation of NCRRR, and the Monitoring
and Evaluation Unit of NCDDR have overall responsibility for monitoring and reporting to the
Bank on the implementation of the CRRP. These units will be responsible for developing the
quarterly progress reports that will contain consolidated information on the Project's institutional
and physical progress. The FMPU is responsible for preparing the quarterly statements of
accounts and providing relevant financial information to the Commission and the Executive
Secretariat for the semi-annual progress reports.
11.17 Both M&E units will set up and maintain a monitoring and evaluation system that will be
compatible and allow for the integration of data between both institutions. Central-level Program
Managers from each institution will be responsible for ensuring that regional offices submit
monthly consolidated progress reports, maintaining and updating the M&E database, analyzing
performance data, and helping in the design and implementation of specialized studies as needed.
A database program will be designed for the collection and analysis of Project monitoring data
using off-the-shelf computer software. Consultants have assisted NCDDR in the design,
computenzation, set-up and initial data entry for the Lungi registration activity, and technical
assistance is currently being provided through the Multi-donor Trust Fund to design and develop
the overall DDR M&E system. Similar assistance will be provided for the development of
NCRRR's M&E system using PPF funds or through a grant from DFID. The TORs for this
position are shown in Attachment 10). On-going technical assistance support is also envisioned
under the Credit to help in the analysis of data, training of staff in system use, and the
development and conduct of specialized beneficiary assessments. Each Project year, the
Government and the Bank will agree on a list of indicators, and annmal target levels, to be used to

monitor the performance of the Project. This list will be drawn from the indicators shown in the
Project Summary Table in Attachment 3.

11.19 ERSFSub-projects. The Emergency Recovery Support Fund is a social fund delivery
mechanism designed to support demand driven community based sub-projects prepared jointly by
communities  and  selected  implementing  partners.    Therefore,  specialized  procedures  for
contracting with implementing agencies (NGOs, line ministries, etc.) have been designed to take
into consideration the substantive involvement of both the community and the implementing
organization in the preparation and implementation of the sub-project. These procedures are
described in detail in the Project's Operational Manual. The sub-projects will be carried out by
implementing partners with technical oversight from NCRRR, NCDDR and relevant line
ministries as appropriate.

11.20 Sub-projects will be prepared in conformance with broad sectoral guidelines established
for the CRRP. Review and evaluation of both sub-projects and potential implementing partners
are based on detailed criteria that measure institutional capacity, project coherence, financial
soundness, community participation, environmental impact and sub-project sustainability.
Appropnate technical staff from NCRRR, NCDDR, and line ministries will review both
organizaions and sub-project designs using standard criteria, technical specifications and unit
costs by sub-project type.
11.21 NCRRR and NCDDR will have responsibility for overseeing the contracting of
implementing agencies for sub-projects. The Finanial Management and Procurement Unit will
ensure that contracting is done in accordance with appropriate World Bank Guidelines. Regional
inter-agency committees will have authority to approve sub-projects up to US$50,000 in value;
projects above this threshold will require cental-level NCRRR1NCDDR approval. World Bank
prior review will be required for sub-project contracts valued at USS200,000, or more. The
capacity of the regional committees, NCRRR, NCDDR and the FMPU to adequately manage the
procurement responsibilities under the Project will be tested during a pilot phase carried out with
PPF support.
11.22 Goods. Procurement of goods (including vehicles, equipment, and furniture) under the
institutional support sub-components of the Project will be carried out in accordance with World
Bank procedures as laid out in, "Guidelines, Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" of
January 1995 (revised August 1996 and September 1997). Contracts for goods estimated to cost
US$200,000 or more will follow standard international competitive bidding procedures
acceptable to the World Bank. Contracts for less than US$200,000 (up to an aggregate amount of
USS200,000) may be procured using national competitive bidding procedures per paragraphs 3.3
and 3.4 of said Guidelines. Contracts for goods estimated to cost less than US$50,000 may be
procured using national shopping (up to an aggregate amount of US$150,000) and international
shopping (up to an aggregate amount of US$100,000). Prior World Bank review for bidding
documents and contract award will be required for any single contract in excess of US$100,000.
11.23 The Financial Management and Procurement Unit (FMPU) will have responsibility for
compiling procurement requests and preparing standard documentation to effect all procurement
under the Project. World Bank standard bidding forms, documents and contracts will be used by
the Unit for this purpose. The FMPU will also assist sub-project implementing agencies prepare
standard bid documents and carry out bulk procurement of necessary inputs as and when
required.
11.24 Serices. All technical assistance and consulting services under the Project will be
procured in accordance with the standard guidelines for the selection and employment of
consultants by World Bank borrowers (January 1997, revised September 1997 and January 1999).
All technical assistance services worth US$50,000 and more will be contracted for using Quality-
and Cost-Based Selection procedures as described in Section 11 of the Guidelines. Audit services
required under the Project will be secured using least-cost procedures in accordance with
pargraph 3.6 of the Guidelines, and all local technical assistance needs valued at less than
US$50,000 per contract will be selected based on consultants' qualifications as described in
pargraph 3.7 of the Guidelines.
11.25 Service contracts estimated to be worth more than US$50,000 for individuals, and

(iv) techmical evaluation, (v) final evaluation report and recommendation for selection, and
(vi) draft contract. Furthermore, World Bank prior review and non-objection will always be
required for: (i) tenms of reference for services to be financed under the Credit, (ii) relevant
documentation for services to be contacted for using single source method of procurement, and
(iii) the modification of any service contract that exceeds, or would exceed as a result of the
modification, the previously indicated prior review thresholds. The Financial Management and
Procurement Unit will ensure that appropriate standard documentation (including RFPs,
evaluation reports, lump sum or complex time-based contrats, etc.) are prepared and that World
Bank guidelines are applied in contacting technical assistance services for the Project.
Procurement Planning and Monitoring
11.26 Prior to Project start-up, the Government will prepare the procurement plan for the
overall Project, and provide a draft General Procurement Notice for World Bank non-objection,
and subsequent publication in United Nations Development Business. Subsequently, the FMPU
will take principal responsibility for coordinating all aspects of procurement under the Project for
NCRRR and NCDDR.
11.27 The World Bank will monitor the proper implementation of procurement procedures
continuously for those goods and services which exceed the prior review thresholds as described
above. For other contracts that fill below these thresholds, the World Bank will monitor the
approprate application of Bank procedures through post reviews during the semi-annual
supervision missions. Furthermore, the Bank will require that the audit firm carrying out the
semi-annual audits for the Project assess and provide an opinion on whether or not proper
procurement procedures are being followed as defined in the Credit Agreement.
Disbursements, Financial Management and Auditing
11.28 For the purpose of this Project, an IDA Credit of US$25 million equivalent will be
disbursed over a period of three years in accordance with the table presented below.

11.30 The Government will open an account in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA for the
purpose of the Special Account at a level of US$1 million. The Government also will establish
and maintain a separate Project Account in local currency at a level of USS250,000, equivalent,
for all Government counterpart contributions to the Project. The FMPU will manage both
accounts on behalf of the Government; two signatories will be required on both accounts,
one from the FMPU (the Unit Manager or his/her designee) and one from NCRRR (either the
Commissioner or the Deputy Commissioner) for related NCRRR expenditures or commitments,
or one from NCDDR (either the Executive Secretary or the Director of Reinsertion and
Reintegration) for related expenditures or commitments. Replenishment of the Special Account
will be made based on satisfactory review of appropriate documentation prepared and submitted
by the Government. The Government will anange for replenishment of the Project Account on a
quarterly, or as need, basis. Withdrawal applications for direct payment and special commitments
wil be made for payments of no less than 20% of the Special Account value. All necessary
documentation supporting Project related disbursements will be maintained by the FMPU for
inspection by Bank supervision missions and independent auditors.
11.31 The Government will finance ten percent for all locally procured goods (office fumiture,
equipment and vehicles), and twenty percent of all operating costs associated with the Project.
Furermore, IDA will only reimburse a maximum of ninety percent of the total sub-project costs,
with the balance being met by either the Govermment, the implementing parter or the commumty
itself with in-kind contributions. The table below indicates the level of financing for each
category of expenditure under the Project, and the limits on IDA contributions.

11.32 Audits will be conducted semi-annually as stipulated in the Credit Agreement by a
certified independent public accounting firm acceptable to IDA. The semi-annual audit report
will be sent to IDA not later than 45 days after June 30th and December 31st of each calendar
year.
Bank Project Supervision and Evaluation
11.33 IDA staff and consultants will supervise the Project at least semi-annually. The tentative
timetable and estimate of staff time and technical assistance needs for these missions are shown
in the Supervision Table presented below. As an Emergency Credit, this Project will not require
a nid-term review, however, a special assessment of the ERSF will be carried out after
six months miplementation, scheduled for May 2000. In addition, IDA will provide ongoing
supervision and support to the Prcject through the review of consultant reports, audit statements,
procurement and disbursement actions, and day-to-day communications.
11.34 The Government will facilitate Bank supervision of the Project by preparing and making
available to IDA quarterly financial statements of accounts and physical progress reports that will
quantify and discuss the Project's performance in accordance with the agreed upon indicators. In
addition, the Government will carry out annual Project review and performance workshops with
implementing partners to assess Project implementation and design assumptions, and to make
adjustments in Project implementation as appropriate. An Implementation Completion Report
will be prepared by the Government and transmitted to IDA within six months of Credit closing.

Transparency and Accountability
11.35 The Government fully appreciates the need for transparency and accountability in the
Project implementation process to avoid duplication of effort and unnecessary wastage of scarce
resources. Inter-Agency Forums (IAF) and Projects Committees at regional and national levels
will provide an open environment for the interaction of Government, implementing partners, and
target beneficiaries in relation to activities financed under the Project. These fora will serve in
the selection of implementing partners and sub-project activities based on clear and objective
criteria. The sub-project selection criteria will be widely publicized and disseminated among all
potential implementing agencies; NCRRR has already taken the initiative to provide this
information to the partner organizations. Furthennore, the sub-project review process will be
recorded and subject to external audit if questions anse. Finally, the inter-agency nature of the
IAF and the ERSF Projects Committees provides additional transparency to the respective review
processes.
11.36 Once sub-projects are approved for implementation, funds will be made available to
implementing agencies as stipulated in the corresponding contracts. Systems will be developed
and staff contracted that have direct and ongoing responsibility for overseeing the use of physical,
miaterial and financial resources, and in measuring performance of the Project based on agreed
upon input, output and outcome indicators. Monthly technical and financial reports, and quarterly
progress reports will be prepared by implementing partners and reviewed by NCRRR and
NCDDR staff and the Projects Committees. An evaluation report will be prepared for all sub-
projects at the end of the program period. NCRRR and NCDDR will also compile monthly
physical progress and quarterly qualitative progress reports on Project implementation as well as
conduct periodic site surveys and beneficiary assessments of sub-projects for IDA and other
donor review.
11.37 Ultimately, the proper application of Project criteria and guidelines will be ensured
through semi-annual audits of Project accounts by an independent public accounting firm. In
addition to providing an opinion as to the status and use of Project funds, the auditor will also
assess Government and sub-project implementing partners' compliance with the appropriate
procurement and disbursement requirements under the Project. IDA will also carry out at least
semi-annual supervision missions to help maintain the highest degree of accountability.

12. SPECIFIC DELIVERY MECHANISMS
12.1  The unique naure of the Government's programs to address both reinsertion and
rehabilitation efforts call for specialized implementation structures and delivery mechansms. In
response, the Government has prepared detailed procedures and guidelines for the Emergency
Recovery Support Fund (ERSF) and for the Training and Employment Program.. The Operations
Manual for the ERSF was developed in 1997 and was updated in late 1998. Similarly,
procedures for the TEP were developed in 1998 and have been updated and refined in 1999. Both
Operations Manuals have been reviewed by IDA and the most recent versions of these manuals
are contained in the Project File. While aspects of both the ERSF and the TEP have been
highlighted in the previous sections of the Technical Annex, this chapter more fully describes the
systems and procedures central to the operation of these two program funding mechanisms.
The ERSF
12.2  The Emergency Recovery Support Fund is a demand-driven social fund that allows the
Government great flexibility in responding to the needs of recovery and reintegration. The Fund
will be used to address the resettlement and reconstruction efforts as well as support labor-
intensive public works net program that are of concern to the NCRRR.
12.3  The ERSF was developed by the Government in recognition of three important facts
about post-conflict emergencies in general and the state of Sierra Leone in particular: (i) it is
essential that assistance be delivered to the people and communities most affected by the conflict
as quicldy as possible so that further deterioration can be avoided, (ii) a multi-sectoral approach is
required given the extent of social and economic destruction associated with conflicts, and
(iii) the GOSL line ministries and other authorities could not be counted on to respond as required
given their bureaucratic and overly centralist natures, inadequate inter-ninisterial coordination,
and their overall weakened capacities. The decentralized and autonomous nature of the Fund, and
the fact that it builds on the implementation capacity of local and intemational NGOs, as well as
local level government departnents, is an appropriate design and one that responds well to the
challenges of post-conflict situations. The ERSF is being piloted under the PPF, and the
Govemment intends to conduct a detailed review of its operation after six months to make
appropriate changes to the implementation strategies or administrative systems. Terms of
reference for the assessment of the pilot phase of the Project and implementation of the ERSF are
contained in Attachment 12.
12.4  Implementation of the ERSF depends on a decentalized management structure and inter-
agency collaboration. Six structures are critical to the Fund: (i) the existing regional Inter-agency
Forums, (ii) the regional ERSF Projects Committees, (iii) the technical secretariat based in each
Regional NCRRR office, (iv) the existing technical committees or task forces also operating in
each of the three regional (provincial) capitals, (v) the National ERSF Projects Committee, and
(vi) the Financial Management and Procurement Unit (FMPU). Each body and its general
responsibilities are described below.



TechnicalAnnex                         Project Title: Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation
County: Sierra Leone                                                         Page 62 of87
12.5   The existing Inter-agency Forums will provide broad-based, multi-sectoral and inter-
agency feedback to the sub-project approval and monitoring process. This body is chaired by the
NCRRR Regional Coordinator and serves as the forum for general information exchange and
identification of potential problems or conflicts in ERSF project design and implementation. All
proposed projects will be presented to this body before a detailed review is conducted by NCRRR
staff and the appropriate technical body so as to draw upon the collective knowledge of the
broader development community in the regions. Membership in this forum is open to all
interested parties and potential implementing partners throughout the region.
12.6 Each region will establish an ERSF Projects Committee which will have responsibility
for reviewing and approving sub-projects up to the threshold level of $US 50,000, equivalent.
This Committee will be composed of 2 NCRRR staff (the Regional Coordinator and one other
staff member"1) the HACU regional officer, the regional MOFDEP representative, and one
representative of the implementing partners who will be nominated by the Inter-agency Forum.12
The Regional Coordinator will chair the Committee.'3
12.7   Each region will have an ERSF technical secretariat, consisting of two projects officers
and one finance officer, who will carry out the day-to-day adminmtrave tasks associated with
ERSF sub-project review and monitoring. While the secretariat is responsible to the Projects
Committee, on a day-to-day basis these staff will report to the regional NCRRR Coordinator.
12.8   As neither the ERSF Projects Committee nor the technical secretariat will necessarily
have all the information or technical knowledge to adequately assess all types of proposals,
existing technical sub-committees will be called upon to review specific technical aspects of
sub-project proposals submitted to the ERSF. The NCRRR Regional Coordinator would seek the
cooperation of the relevant technical committees or ad hoc groups through the appropriate line
ministry or public authority (such as SLRA), and will have access to necessary resources to
facilitate individual and committee members input to this process.
12.9   A National ERSF Projects Committee will be formed at central level to: (i) approve or
reject all recommended sub-projects that exceed the regional approval threshold of US$50,000'4,
(ii) review and approve all urban public works projects that target the unemployed of Greater
Freetown, and (iii) review and approve all project proposals that are national in scope such as
those presented by central level line ministries. The National Committee will be chaired by the
NCRRR Director for Programming & Coordination, and wil include the Director for Planning,
Monitoring and Evaluation; the Director of the SAPA Program; a representative for the
10 In order to ensure smooth processing and a period for regional capacity-building, all sub-projects above USS25,000
equivalent will have to be approved by the National ERSF Projects Committee m Freetown duinng the first 6 months
of ERSF implementation.
Duing the pilot phase, the second NCRRR person will be a hedquate staff to help ensr proper implementation
of ERSF procedures and to help bild the capacity of the regional committees and review process.
12 The IAF will nominate 1 representative and I altemnate so as to avoid any conflict of interest in the event that a
proposal is submitted by the LAF represetative's implementing organization.
3 The feasibility of including a beneficiary representative on the Projects Committee will be considered as part of the
six-month review of the ERSF pilot phase.
4 Sub-project contracts equal to or exceeding $200,000 will also require the non-objection of the World Bank.

established to assist NCRRR with all aspects of contracting, disbursements, financial
management and reporting in relation to the ERSF, as well as other donor financed activities
within the Commission. Once an ERSF project is approved and contracts are signed by the
Commission, the FMPU will manage all direct payments made to implementing partners and will
ensure that financial reporting and record keeping is in line with GOSL and donor requirements,
and internationally accepted accounting standards.

ERSF Sub-Project Proposal, Review & Approval Procedures
Sub-Project Proposal Development
12.11 Potential implementing partners first contact NCRRR to receive appropriate guidance in
preparing a sub-project proposals. For this purpose, NCRRR has developed guidelines and
standard formats to assist implementing partners in the proposal development process. While
information will be available at all NCRRR central, regional, and district offices, partners will be
encouraged to contact the appropriate regional or district level office nearest the point where the
sub-project would be implemented.
12.12 Implementing agencies will present project ideas, or concepts, to the Inter-agency Forum
for review and comment prior to submission of a full proposal. This review is designed to ensure
better coordination of development activities in the region, and to identify any potential problems
or concerns in the design of the project. The implementing partner will be encouraged to present
the sub-project concept to the IAF directly, however, if an organization cannot be present at the
IAF meeting, NCRRR staff (either district or regional) can present the sub-project concept on
behalf bf the implementing partner. NCRRR will develop a standard form that implementing
partners can use to prepare and submit this brief project summary to the ERSF project officer at
the regional NCRRR office. The project officer would then determine when the summary would
be presented to the LAF based on the volume and backlog of proposals, and the other duties of the
LAW. A project concept must be reviewed by the L4F before it can be consideredforjunding by
NCRRR
12.13 Once the LAF has reviewed and commented upon a project idea, an implementing partner
can present a full sub-project proposal to NCRRR taking into consideration any comments or
concems raised by the LAF. Sub-project proposals should be submitted directly to the NCRRR
regional office, however, district and chiefdom based organizations may submit proposals to
NCRRR through the district offices if more convenient. District staff will have no direct
responsibility for reviewing proposals, however, and will transmit all proposals (and project
concepts) directly to the regional office for consideration. To be eligible to have a proposal
considered under the ERSF, an NGO or CBO must have submitted an "NGO Profile" form to
NCRRR.lS
ProposalReview
12.14 Project proposal review will be the main responsibility of the ERSF secretariat staff (the
Projects and Finance officers at the regional NCRRR office). These staff will first ensure that a
sub-project and the applicant organization meet basic eligibility criteria (as described in the
Project Operational Manual). At this same time, the ERSF secretariat staff will verify that any
comments or concerns raised by the IAF have been taken into consideration in the sub-project
proposal. If a sub-project or organization is found to be ineligible based on the basic criteria of
the ERSF, or if the issues raised by the LAF have not been addressed or clarified, the proposal will

technical review of sub-projects. A technical sub-committee will be required to review and
respond to the specific technical issues within 5 days of receipt of a proposal (or specific
technical questions) from NCRRR. The sub-committee will review sub-project proposals to
determine their technical viability, propose   modifications (if any) and indicate their
recommendation of the sub-project on technical grounds. Member or members of the sub-
committee will be able to visit the site of a sub-project or the offices of an applicant agency in
reviewing the proposal.  The Environmental Protection Department of the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Environment (MAFE) will assist NCRRR with any sub-projects for
which environmental concerns require further review and analysis. NCRRR regional offices will
make appropriate resources (e.g. supplies, logistics, trekking allowances, etc.) available to the
technical sub-committee members to ensure adequate and timely action (including MAFE
environmental assessments) is taken.
Sub-Projed Approval
12.18 Recommendations from both the ERSF secretariat and respective sub-committee will be
consolidated by the Project Officers and passed on to the ERSF Projects Committee. This
Committee will meet fortnightly to review the technical recommendations and decide to either
approve or reject a sub-project proposal, up to a threshold of US$50,000, equivalent. For sub-
projects above this threshold, the regional ERSF Projects Committee may either reject or
L~rcdn~fl4 a proposal to the central level for approval. For this purpose, a National ERSF
Projects Committee will be formed and be given the authority to approve projects over
US$50,000. The national committee will be composed of the NCRRR Director of Programming
& Coordination (chair); the Director of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation; the Director of the
SAPA Progam; one representative from the Development Department of MOFDEP; and one
representative from UN/OCHA. The sub-project review and approval process is illustrated in
Figure 12-3.
12.19 NCRRR will manage different sources of funding from different donor agencies.
Nonetheless, it is hoped that the procedures presented here can be applied to the greatest extent
possible to all outside funding. However, early in the approval process, the Commission will
determine which funding mechanism at its disposal would be the most appropriate for a given
project. By so doing, NCRRR can then take appropriate intenal administtive action to seek
any special approvals for different programs (such as SAPA) or funding agencies to reduce the
need for different external procedures or requirements of potential implementing partners.
ERSF Implementation Arrangements
Contrading
12.20 Once a project has been approved, the ERSF Projects Officer in each region will prepare
the contract for signature based on a standard contract fonnat and required attachments. The
contract will include a summary description of the project, a detailed implementation plan,
project budget and disbursement schedule, and customized forms for physical and financial
progress reporting. Contracts for sub-projects valued at less than US$50,000 will be signed by
the Regional Coordinator/NCRRR, contacts in excess of this threshold will be signed by the
Commissioner of NCRRR.

Disbursements and Financial Control
12.21 The Financial Management and Procurement Unit (FWMPU) will disburse funds to the
implementing partners for project activities once the Commission has authorized the contract. All
disbursements will be made based on monthly financial reports, adequate documentation of
claimed expenditures, and periodic requests for payment submitted by implementing partners to
the regional ERSF Finance Officers. Inplementing partners will submit monthly reports and
associated documentation to the Finance Officers no latter than 10 days after the close of the
preceding month. These reports and requests for payment will be reviewed and consolidated at
regional level and sent to the FMPU for final review and payment processing. The same
consolidated report is sent to the ERSF Projects Committee for monitoring purpose. In the event
of any questions or concerns raised by the regional Finance Officers, the Projects Committee,
and/or the FMPU, the financial officer will follow-up directly with the implementing partners.

conract between the Government and the implementing partners, and all forms for such
transactions will be provided to the implementing partners as attachments to the standard
contract. Unless issues or questions arise regarding reported expenditures and the status of
outstanding balances, payments will be made to implementing partners within 20 days of
financial report submission and request for payment. In the event of questions or concerns
regarding reported expenditures, only those specific expenditures under question would be
withheld from reimbursement

12.23 NCRRR will require that all sub-projects valued at more thal $50,000, equivalent be
audited by an independent public accounting firm. The audit should include a review of the
contactual obligations and restictions for the ERSF sub-project. If an implementing partner
already conducts annual external audits of its accounts, then this audit will be adequate for
NCRRR and ERSF purposes, provided that it also reviews the contractual obligations under the
ERSF. The incremental costs for such audit will be an allowable expense under the ERSF sub-
project activity.  If a sub-project is valued at less than $50,000, equivalent, and if the
implementing partner does not have an independent audit of their accounts conducted annually,
NCRRR will require that all original vouchers for all expenses claimed under ERSF be submitted
to NCRRR as part of the monthly financial report. Otherwise, copies of invoices and vouchers
will be adequate for the purposes of financial reporting.
12.24 To help fwrther guarantee Project accountability, the Internal Control Unit of the FMPU
will be authorized to carry out spot checks of ERSF sub-project expenditures reported by
implementing partners. Finally, the semi-annual audits of the overall NCRRR and NCDDR
operations will also include a random testing of ERSF sub-project activities and expenditures.
Procurement Procedures for Sub-projects
12.25 Prior to entering into contract with any implementing partner for an ERSF sub-project
that would involve substantial procurement, the Government should be satisfied that the systems
and procedures of the responsible institution will ensure transparent and cost-effective
procurement. All such sub-project procurement shall be carried out in accordance with
appropriate World Bank guidelines for goods, works and services, and the thresholds specified
for the CRRP, as described in previous chapter of this document
12.26  While the Government expects that certain minimum standard procedures as described
below will be followed by the implementing agencies, as a general rule, procurement will be the
responsibility of individual implementing partners and will be carried out directly by these
agencies. Exceptions to this rule would arise only in inslances where an organization lacks
adequate experience or capacity to effectively carry out the required level of procurement, or
when obvious efficiencies may be realized. Under these rare circumstances, the specific method
and mechanisms for procurement will be highlighted in the contract between Govermnent and
implementing agency. The FMPU would be available to provide guidance and supply standard
bidding documents and formats for any specialized procurement that may be called for (such as
national competitive bidding).
12.27 Under normal circumstances, procurement under the ERSF will abide by the following
principles and thresholds:
*  All procurements under the sub-projects must be supported by appropriate
documentation, which includes specifications (or terms of reference), request for
proposal, bid, contract, invoice, and proof of payment.
* Three profonna invoices are required for procurement of any item with a unit
acquisition cost estimated to be more than Le. 100,000 (approximately $50).
*  Any service contract which is valued at more than Le. 1,500,000 (approximately
$750) must have written terms of reference (or other detailed description of expected
activities and outputs of the service) which includes minimum qualifications for

contract award, and should be done by comparing at least three (3) qualified persons
or firms.
* Any service contract which is valued at more than Le. 25,000,000 (approximately
$12,500) must be advertised in at least two local newspapers and open to all qualified
national or international individuals or firms (as determined by the specific type of
service to be provided).
*  Contracts for civil works estimated to cost less than Le. 25,000,000 may be procured
using community participation as per guidelines to be developed by NCRRR which
meet IDA requirements
*  Contrcts for works esfimated to cost more than Le. 50,000,000 (approximately
$25,000), and for goods estimated to cost more than Le. 25,000,000 must be procured
using established National Competitive Bidding procedures (guidelines to be
provided by NCRRR).

12.28 Prior to initiating procurement under the ERSF for any infrastructure or asset to be turned
over to the community (such as a school, clinic, well, etc.), the Contractor must provide
Government with an acceptable Operations and Maintenance plan for the structure or asset that
ensures its sustainability.
Monitoring andReporting
12.29 Implementing agencies are required to submit monthly technical reports to the ERSF that
quantify project outputs and quarterly narrative progress reports providing details of project
progress and constraints. The Govermuent will identify with the implementing partner prior to
sub-project implementation the specific indicators of progress and performance for each sub-
project. These indicators will then be incorporated into the standard forms provided to the
implementing agencies by the Government so that monitoring of sub-project progress can be
uniform across similar types of activities.
12.30 Implementing agencies will submit two copies of each report to NCRRR; one will go to
the District Supervisor where the project activities are being implemented, and one to the
Regional Coordinator for the appropriate region. NCDDR will also receive a copy of the
progress report for those activities that target ex-combatants. As with the financial reports, these
technical progress reports will be submitted within 10 days of the close of the reporting period.
Customized formats for reporting technical progress will be designed and made available to
implementing partners as attachments to the standard ERSF project contract.
12.31 District Supervisors will receive the reports and be responsible for verifying the
information presented through regular communications with the implementing partners and field
visits to the project sites. The regional NCRRR Project Officers, or NCDDR Counselors and
Employment Promoters, will review and consolidate the progress reports for all active projects in
the region. The regional offices will have responsibility for entering physical progress data into a
computerized monitoring system. A consolidated report on all regional projects will be prepared
by the project officer and presented to the ERSF Projects Committee by the Regional Coordinator
for review and discussion. A copy of the same report will be sent to the relevant line ministries in
the region. The consolidated report and the electronic data will also be sent to the Directorate of
Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (for NCRRR sub-projects), and the Monitoring and
Evaluation Manager (for NCDDR sub-projects) at national level for further consolidation and
analysis. The respective central M&E units of NCRRR and NCDDR will prepare a quarterly
progress report on the overall implementation of the ERSF.
Training and Employment Program
Overview
12.32 The Disarmament Demobilization and Reintegration of ex-combatants is an integral part
of the national peace-building process and Government's reconstruction policy as outlined in its'
Ninety-Day Program for the Restoration of Democratic Rule in Sierra Leone. The ex-combatants
constitute a considerable risk group capable of undemining current security gains and therefore
require targeted assistance. Government realizes that the security benefits of demobilization and



TechnicalAnnex                      Project Title: Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation
Country: Sierra Leone                                                 Page 71 of 87
reintegration would, in the short-term, come at a financial cost for facilitating the return to
civilian life; yet in the long term it provides the basis for post war recovery.
12.33  Given the fact that many ex-combatants have neither finished formal education nor
acquired marketable skills, the economic outlook for many is bleak. Absorption by the formal
sector including the civil service, is beyond the reach of unskilled or functionally illiterate ex-
combatants. Therefore, the need to offer options for economic reintegration, in agriculture and
informal sector in particular, is clear so as to avoid ex-combatants reverting to rent-seeking at the
barrel of a gun.
12.34 In response, the Government has developed the Training and Employment Program
(TEP), to be coordinated by NCDDR, which will support the social and economic reintegration of
former combatants through targeted counseling, traimng and employment programs. The TEP is
a critical strategy of the overall national rehabilitation and reconstruction program that is based on
other country experiences which clearly show that the disarmament and demobilization of
combatants is only the beginning of a long and sometimes arduous process of assisting former
combatants return to their home communities and initiate productive lives.
12.35 The TEP will assist the approximately 45,000 demobilized ex-combatants of the RUF,
AFSL, AFRC and CDF currently targeted under the National DDR Program. Potential program
activities will include employment orientation workshops; short-term skills introduction/training;
information, counseling and reintegration sensitization, longer-term, market-driven skills training;
apprenticeships; non-formal literacy and numeracy education; short-term labor-intensive
employment generation activities, etc.
12.36 The Executive Secretariat of the NCDDR has been charged with the responsibility of
overall program planning and implementation of the TEP, which it will do in close collaboration
with partner organizations such as NGOs, line ministry units, parastat  organizations, training
institutions, private finns and community based organizations. Donor organizations such as the
USAID, European Union, GTZ and UNDP will support the efforts of the Executive Secretariat to
address the re-integraton needs of the former combatants.
12.37 Under the TEP,the social reintegration program would include civic education, socio-
pschological counseling and referral programs designed to prepare ex-combatants for their return
to civilian life, and to assist them by providing critical psycho-social support during the
reintegration phase.
12.38 The economic reintegration services would include a vocational orientation, counseling
on job-seeking strategies, information and counseling on training and employment opportunities
and advice on establishing micro-projects. The TEP will also offer concrete means for linking
ex-combatants to training and employment opportunities, and referrals to labor intensive public
works, broader rehabilitation projects and income generation activities.  Procedures and
implementation arrangements under the TEP would be tested during six-month pilot phase.
12.39 The TEP will also provide opportunities for vocational tamining and apprenticeships. The
program will encourage existing training suppliers to prepare and implement short modular
training courses that correspond to the educational background of the ex-combatants, their career
interests, and the needs of the labor market skills development would be provided through a
contract training scheme and training provider. In the 6-month pilot phase of the program
rehabilitation of vocational training infrastructure will also be required. Once this capacity has



TechnicalAnnex                      Project Title: Community Reintegration andRehabilitation
Country: Sierra Leone                                                Page 72 of 87
been re-established the introduction of subsidies may be provided to ensure that the training is
sufficiently demand driven and to enable ex-combatants to purchase the training that they feel
will increase their employability. The TEP will also finance training expenses incurred by
artisans who train ex-combatants through informal sector apprenticeship. Tool kits would be
provided upon commencement of the apprenticeship or after completion of the vocational training
to attract employers.
12.40 The Reintegration Unit of the NCDDR will coordinate project planning implementation
and monitoring of all TEP-supported pre-discharge orientation and reintegration assistance to ex-
combatants subsequent to discharge. The Executive Secretariat will tap into and build upon
exisfing systems and structures as well as help to build additional capacity among training
providers as necessary. TEP project proposals can be submitted to NCDDR in one of two ways:
(i) as a result of a formal Request for Proposals (REP) that would be issued by the Executive
Secretariat, or (ii) through a demand-driven process where eligible implementing agencies
identify an area of need in collaboration with ex-combatants and present an unsolicited proposal
in form and substance acceptable to NCDDR  TEP operating pnnciples, eligibility criteria for
implementing agencies, and financial requirements for proposals will be similar to those for the
ERSF. The systems and procedures to be used in implementing the TEP are described in detail in
the TEP Operations Manual.
TEPProposai Development, Review andApprovalProcedures
12.41 Requests for Proposals. Under the TEP, NCDDR will identify specific needs and
develop specific requests for proposal (RFP) for all pre-discharge orientation activities, and for
some post-discharge reintegration assistance as well. The central and regional NCDDR staff;
canp administators, and technical advisors to the Executive Secretariat will all be involved in
the identification of needs and development of specific terms of reference that will form the basis
for the RFP. In these cases, specific TORs for services will be developed, standard contracting
documents prepared, and evaluation criteria identified to be used for evaluating proposals,
negotiating final agreements, and contracting for services. The general technical criteria noted
above would be customized to each individual assignment and weightings assigned to each area
of review. Cost would also be included as an evaluation criteria. The issuing of an RFP by
NCDDR will be announced in the local newspapers and all interested and eligible organizations
will be invited to review the documentation and prepare a proposal. Standard World Bank
guidelines for quality and cost-based selection of consultant services will be used by NCDDR for
these types of procurement. Detailed technical and financial review of proposals will be carried
out by a specific evaluation committee formed at the time an RFP is issued.
12.42 In certain instances, when the anticipated size of a contract is below US$100,000, and
when speed of response is of the essence, Government may opt to send an RFP directly to a short-
list of eligible organizations who have been identified earlier and pre-qualified to carry out certain
type and size activities. In this case, a short-list of no fewer than three and no more than six
organizations or training institutions will be invited to bid on a specific assigmnent required by
NCDDR. Organizations will be eligible to apply and be pre-qualified to bid on such assignments
at any time during the implementation of the Project. Short-listed firms will be selected randomly
from the most recently updated list of pre-qualified organizations.
12.43 World Bank no-objection will be required prior to the issuance of any RFPs and the
signature of any contract with an estimated value of US$100,000 or more for a firm, or



TechnicalAnnex                      Project itie: CommunityReintegration andRehabilitafion
Counhy: Sierra Leone                                                   Page 73 of 87
US$50,000 or more for an individual. Furthermore, Bank non-objection will be required for all
TORs and for any single source contract issued by NCDDR for TEP related assistance, regardless
of contract value.
12.44 Unsolicted ProposaL NCDDR also expects that certain reintegration support projects
will result from a demand-oriented process whereby ex-combatants and eligible implementing
agencies together formulate an assistance proposal. These proposals might include micro-credit
assistance, small-scale public works activities, business management taining, or provide for start-
up capital, etc. In this case, the procedures, formats and guidelines developed for NCRRR's
Emergency Recovery Support Fund (ERSF) will be adapted and applied to the TEP. These
formats and procedures have been designed to help standardize proposal submissions and review,
and are presented and described in detail in the ERSF Operations Manual. Predefined general
and specific technical criteria would be applied to each unsolicited proposal, similar to the
procedure under the ERSF. Particular attention would be given to: a) the degree to which the
proposal reflects the expressed need of the proposed group of ex-combatants, and b) the capacity
of the implementing agency to cafry out the proposed assistance. If necessary, NCDDR staff
would seek more specific technical input from relevant line ministries or public agencies
(for instance, from SLRA in the case that a road works project is submitted) in assessing these
types of proposals.
12.45 Under World Bank financed TEP activities, unsolicited proposals would require a
10 percent counter-part contribution from either the beneficiary group, the implementing partner,
or the Government. The World Bank would reimburse up to a maximnm of 90 percent of the
otal value of a TEP financed activity resulting from an unsolicited proposal.
12.46  Contactng. In the case of RFPs, final project proposals will be negotiated according to
the procedures laid out in the World Bank guidelines for the selection and employment of
consulans (January 1997, revised September 1997 and lanuary 1999). Once successfully
negotiated, contracts will be signed between implementing agencies and the Executive Secretauy
of NCDDR for defined services. NCDDR will use the standard consultant service contract for
fixed sum or time-based assignments for contracts resulting from an RFP. For unsolicited
proposals, NCDDR will use either the approved contract between implementing agencies and the
GOSL (as shown in the existing Operations Manual for the ERSF), or standard World Bank
contracts for finns.
Disbursement and Financial Control under TEP
12.47 All disbursement and financial control responsibilities under TEP will be managed by the
Financial Management and Procurement Unit. This unit will be responsible for disbursing funds
to all consultants, contractors, and vendors on behalf of NCDDR (as well as NCRRR) once
authorization to do so is given by the respective institution. The FMPU will maintain all financial
records (including contacts, invoices, financial reports, etc.) related to TEP activities, ensure that
contractors abide by the financial management and procurement requirements under the Project,
and prepare all necessary financial reports, requests for payments, etc. required by the World
Bank and other donors hat support the TEP and the NDDRP. The FMPU will also take
responsibility for assisting NCDDR with procurement of necessary inputs for the overall Project,
and, as necessary, assist contractors to procure goods that may be required under the TEP assisted
activities. Finally, the FMPU will ensure that the internal control procedures for the use of CRRP
resources (as applied under the TEP as well as other components of the Project) are adhered to

and that agreed upon review, approval and contracting procedures for the TEP as outlined in this
procedures manual are maintained.
12.48 Once a contract is signed between a service provider and the Government, the FMPU will
take responsibility for the disbursement of funds so that work can be carried out. Contractors will
be required to submit monthly statements of expenses and periodic- depending on the type and
schedule of assistance being carried out- requests for reimbursement. NCDDR staff, either the
regional finance officers, site coordiats, or administator will review these SOEs and
reimbursement requests to ensure that reported expenses are reasonable and match reported
physical progress being made under the sub-project. Once approved by NCDDR staff these
financial reports will be submitted to the FMPU where expenditures will be checked for
eligibility, and subsequent payments made based the sub-project budget, current expenditure
category balances, and the disbursement schedule. The FMPU will retain all financial records
associated with the TEP supported activities and would therefore be the focus of both donor
supervision mission review and semi-annual Project audits. As a part of the Project audit,
a random sampling of implementing agency sub-projects will be reviewed in detail to assess
adherence to both the financial management and contractual obligations under the TEP.
12.49 The standard procedures for procurement, monitoring, financial and technical progress
reporting for implementing agencies under the TEP are similar to those required under the ERSF.
Specialized Delivery Procedures under the ERSF
12.50 Public Works Social Safety Nd. A social safety net program that uses labor-intensive
public works activities to create temporary employment among vulnerable groups of ex-
combatants, unemployed urban youth, newly retuming rural communities, and others such as
female-headed households will be implemented as a distinct component under the ERSF. An
outline of the key issues to be considered in targeting and implementing this component is
presented in Attachment 13.
12.51 After consideration of alternative options, the Government and the World Bank
concluded that the ERSF sub-project review and approval procedures should be used for this
element of the Project. The same staff and organizational sucures are capable of handling these
types of projects, and the inter-agency review process will help guarantee both technical
suitability of sub-projects and coordination with other similar activities (such as food for work or
food for agriculture projects). The recent revisions to the institutional structure of NCRRR that
include adding a Western Area office and seeking civil engineers for district level posts, will
facilitate the inclusion of public works sub-project proposals in the review process. Specific
technical criteria will be incorporated into the Project's Operational Manual and be used in
reviewing and assessing these types of public works activities. Based on World Bank best
practices for similar programs, the suggested criteria are as follows:
* public works projects should create temporary employment among the most vulnerable,
while at the same time optimize the social, economic and/or physical infrastructure of the
community;, ideally, being oriented toward funther job creation and/or income
generation;
* geographic targeting of projects to help ensure greatest participation of poorest; therefore,
urban projects should be in those areas where there is general agreement that the poorest
live (e.g.,., Goderich, Congo Town, Dworzak Farm, Kroobay, Ginger Hall, and large

parts of Kissy and Wellington, etc., for Freetown) and for recently returned communities
(within last 12 months) for rural areas and projects;
* project wage rate not to exceed the prevailing market wage for unskilled labor. For
example, in mid-1998, the average daily wage rate for unskilled labor was approximately
Le 1,500, or US$1 per day;
* the total wage component for unskilled labor of the public works project should, on
average, be equal to or exceed 50 percent of the total project cost;
* depending on the type of public works and the location, wages could be paid in both cash
and in-kind (eg, food), however, the total value should not exceed a daily wage rate of
Le. 1,500 as discussed above (per discussions between SLRA and NGOs suggest that for
the implementation of all food-aid projects, 30% of the labor cost shall be paid in food
and 70% in cash);
* projects should encourage linkages between work and productivity through incorporating
a piece-rate or task-based payment system for laborers. (for instances, SLRA's Feeder
Roads Department has established wage rates per man-day for 18 different road
rehabilitation activities);
* projects need to be consistent with existing labor laws;
* projects need to be technically feasible and proposals must demonstrate that appropriate
technical norms and design standards wil be adhered to;
* guarantee of community participation in project design, execution, and maintenance to
ensure long-term sustainability;
* timing and design of services/works should, to the extent possible, encourage broadest
participation and reduce opportumty costs of participation through seasonal timing
(i.e., not during the planting or harvesting seasons) and flexible working arrangements
(such as piece meal rates).
* numnber of laborers at any one-job site should range between 50 and 75, and not exceed
100.
12.52 Pmbfic Sector Instiutions. The technical departments, regional, and district offices of
the line ministries of the GOSL have an important role to fulfill in the implementation of the
ERSF. First, relevant line ministries (i.e., health, education, agriculture, works, etc.) are al
potential implementing partners to the ERSF. NCRRR fully expects that the appropriate
technical units and offices of these ministries will be active participants in the development and
implementation of sub-projects. Secondly, the technical ministries will play a critical role at the
regional level in providing guidance and input to the ERSF project staff and Projects Committee.
NCRRR recognizes the technical expertise and responsibility that the line ministries have in
guaranteeing adherence to sectoral standards and norms. Therefore, technical sub-committees at
the regional level will be called upon to provide specialized knowledge and advice on given sub-
project proposals. The senior technical officer from the relevant line ministry or parastatal
agency will be the contact person for the NCRRR in order to coordinate appropriate technical
reviews of ERSF sub-project proposals. NCRRR will make available to sub-committee members
or specified technical personnel in the regions adequate logistical support to facilitate these
technical reviews of proposals. Finally, NCRRR will rely on the line ministry departments to
help monitor sub-project implementation-- especially regarding technical specifications and
norms. District level NCRRR staff responsible for monitoring ERSF sub-project implementation



TechnicalAnnex                      Project Title: Community Reintegration and Rehabilitatfion
County: &erra Leone                                                   Page 76 of 87
will be responsible for securing the close coordination of line ministry personnel at the same level
when specific technical matters of project implementation are being considered.
12.53 Given the special nature of the line ministry departments as the coordinator of all national
activities for their respective sectors, and as the regulatng body in terms of technical norms and
procedures, the process whereby the line ministries apply to and are financed under the ERSF will
vary slightly. First any project submitted by a district or regional line ministry office must be
endorsed by the appropriate central ministry department. Second, in the event of a national level
project activity (such as for an information campaign, staff traioing etc.), the proposal to the
ERSF would be submitted direy to NCRRR at the central level, and would be reviewed by the
National ERSF Projects Committee. Third, fund disbursement for activities implemented through
line ministry departments would have to be consistent with the financial management
requirements of the Government, as well as abide by the procedures of the FMPU.

13. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
Introduction
13.1  The CRRP has two principal components, namely: (i) an Emergency Recovery Support
Fund (ERSF), and related institutional support to NCRRR and partners; and (ii) a Training and
Employment Program (TEP), and related institutional support to NCDDR. Both components will
finance sub-project activities through a social fundtype mechanism. The ERSF is designed to
finance demand-driven community based sub-projects, while the TEP is designed to finance the
social and economic reintegration of former combatants. The Government initiated the CRRP in
1997 with funding from the Project Preparation Facility. The objective of the Project is to
stimulate economic recovery by expediting the reintegration of internally displaced persons, ex-
combatants and refugees and restoring the provision of basic social services.
Analysis of Alternatives
13.2  The Project has been developed by the key stakeholders in a participatory manner. As
the Government's implementation capacity has been weakened considerably in the course of the
conflict, it was considered advisable for the Project to put greater emphasis on implementation
through existing structures and capacities of partner organizaions: i.e. NGOs, existing project
units and, where feasible, line ministries. During the emergency period, Government has
successfully developed effective coordination mechanisms at national and regional level that will
be used to mobilize these implementing partners to better ensure effective coordination.
Atetive Project implementation strategies considered included implementation via line
ministries or through the exclusive use of technical assistance. Both options were rejected; the
first because of capacity constraints and the second due to concerns regarding ownership,
community participation, and sustanability.
13.3  The capacity of the implementing parters, in particular NGOs, to deliver services has
been analyzed using a number of proxy indicators such as the number of organizations, the time
they have been operatig in country, their sectoral and geographic areas of operation, and their
highest recorded annual program value in the lst five years. Sierra Leone has had a well
established community of developmental NGOs which has further expanded in response to the
war-related breakdown in government capacity. About 71 percent of development organizations
operating today have started to work after 1990.
13.4  The implementation capacity of international NGOs by far exceeds the capacity of
national NGOs, taking the highest annual program value during the Lst five years as an indcator.
International NGOs have an annual turnover of about US$80 million, while the program value of
national NGOs amounts to only US$5.4 million.16 The CRRP will provide institutional support
to national NGOs to enhance their capacity to plan and implement sub-projects.

Sustainability and Fiscal Impact
13.5   The CRRP places the maintenance of social infiatructure in the hands of communities
and line ministries. They hold responsibility for upkeep of structures and staffing in line with
Government regulations and sub-project design. The risk of unsustainable project activities
therefore depends on the type of sub-project and the participation of the beneficiary community;
both issues are to be assessed at time of sub-project evaluation. Systems and procedures have
been developed in the Project's Operational Manual, and training of NCRRR and NCDDR staff
has been camed out, to ensure that sub-ptojects with a low probability of sustainability would not
be undertaken, and that communities and implemnenting agencies with a poor track record be
denied additional sub-projects funding.
13.6   Although studies of the impact of community participation on sustainability in Sierra
Leone do not exist, empirical evidence from similar operations in the Africa Region points to a
strong, positive correlation between community participation and sustainability of projects.
Given the low rural wage rate, use of appropriate technologies, and high output increases,
investments in these types of sub-projects also show high rates of returns.
13.7   The non-quantifiable benefits and positive externalities to communities resulting from
improved basic social and economic infrastructure are substantial and justify public intervention.
The benefits would include improved agricultural production leading to improved food security
and nutritional status of the household, and possibly an increase in household income; safer
drinking water leading to reduction in incidence of water-bome diseases and lost labor
productivity; reduction in drudgery and transaction costs due to the rehabilitation of roads, small
bridges and culverts; and improved health and well-being from the rehabilitation of health
services.
13.8   The Government's counterpart contribution to the Project has been kept to a minimum.
Fuzthennore, due to the emergency nature of the project, no mandatory co-financing requirement
has been placed on the communities. However, it is assumed that depending on the nature of the
sub-project and circumstances, many communities will contribute in kind either through labor or
goods. Therefore, it has been agreed with Govemment that, at a minimum, 10 percent of the total



TechnicalAnnex                      Project Title: Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation
Country: Sierra Leone                                                 Page 79 of 87
sub-project costs will be borne by either, or a combination ot the Govermment, the implementing
agencies, and the beneficiaries.
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
13.9  Interventions under the CRRP will support rehabilitation of basic social and economic
infiastructure, to minimum standards sufficient to permit households and communities to
reestablish themselves. Civil works will largely be small-scale and rehabilitation rather than new
construction, using mainly local materials and labor-intensive techniques. Because of the
demand-driven nature of the project and the variation in conditions in target areas, it is difficult to
determine, a priori, the exact composition of the Projects portfolio. From the point of view of
cost-effectiveness the Project is, however, designed to minimize costs without giving up much
ground in terms of quality. Stringent cost and quality conscious procedures were followed in the
identification and design of the Project. Sub-projects will be selected on a competitive and cost-
effective basis.
13.10 An important economic rationale for investing in the economic recovery and
reintegration of Sierra Leone is the extremely high opportunity cost in terms of growth foregone.
Not investing in rehabilitation of basic social and economic infastructure, not enabling conflict
affected communities to reintegrate reurning households and individuals, and not laying a basis
for restoring local economies would retain Sierra Leone in a social, economic, institutional and
logistical bind that would seriously hamper its economic growth prospects.
13.11 The demand driven nature ofthe sub-projects also prevents a quantitatively reliable cost-
benefit analysis of the overall project. The direct costs of the project are around US$25 million,
however, the direct and indirect benefits cannot be quantified in monetary terms at this time.
Nonetheless, an analysis of illustrative sub-project types and an extrapolation of sub-projects that
have already been submitted under the pilot phase are instructive as to the potential economic
benefits of the Project.
13.12 Analysis of Sub-projects. The CRRP would support the Government's efforts to
stabilize the economy through priority investments in economic and social inastructure in
communities devastated as a result of the civil war. The emergency nature of the proposed
operation and the demand driven nature of individual sub-projects impose certain restrictions on
the conduct of a full economic analysis of the overall project. However, the approach adopted by
the NCRRR and NCDDR is to evaluate the viability of individual sub-projects that would be
proposed by beneficiary communities and groups. A simple, standardized fiamework in the form
of a matrix has been developed to help NCRRR and NCDDR staff examine the economic
viability of sub-projects. Issues considered include: (i) the validity of the project's objective;
(ii) analysis of alternatives; (iii) cost-effectiveness; (iv) fiscal impact and financial sustainability;
and (v) environmental impact. Throughout the Project, indicators will be used to assess
individual sub-project and overall Project performance and impact.  During the initial
implementation phase a management tool will be developed to link the monitoring and evaluation
process closer to cost-effectiveness and/or cost-benefit evaluation techniques. Provision has been
made for a more detailed economic analysis of sub-projects prior to the mid-term review.
13.13 Poverty and Sdf-targedng of Sub-projects. The latest poverty profile for Sierra Leone is
based on the 1989/90 Survey of Household Expenditures and Household Economic Activities.
The Survey offers a useful baseline regarding poverty, however, it is based on data collected prior
to the outbreak of the civil conflict. Social indicators describe very harsh living conditions: life



TechnicalAnnex                       Project Title: Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation
County: Sierra Leone                                                    Page 80 of 87
expectancy averages around 42 years, infant mortality is among the world's highest at
147 deaths/1,000 live births, the literacy rate is estimated at only 20 percent and primary school
enrollment at about 35 percent.
13.14 According to the poverty profile, 81.6 percent of the population are poor, using the
intermational standard of US$1.00 daily per capita expenditures, an d 61.2 percent live in "core'
poverty, based on the standard of USS 0.50 daily per capita expenditures. Income distribution is
generally very unequal, with a Gini Coefficient of 0.63 at the national level, and is even more
unequal in rural areas. Poverty is predominantly a nural phenomenon - 57 percent of the poor
live in rural areas. Furthermore, the depth of poverty is much greater in rural areas, indicating
that a larger number of the rural poor live under the core poverty line.
13.15 As a consequence of the destruction brought by the civil war and military junta and post-
junta period, it is estimated that poverty has become even more severe. The 1989/90 household
survey indiates that the efforts of the CRRP should largely be directed towards the rural areas,
giving high priority to food security and nutrition, and the delivery of social services. It is
expected that the CRRP will respond appropriately to these poverty reduction priorities given the
decentralized and demand driven nature of the Project and the fact that sub-project proposals are
largely developed by, or in close cooperation with, communities. This planning hypothesis has
been borne out in the PPF-financed pilot phase of the ERSF, where the majority of the submitted
sub-projects target agricultural rehabilitation (58 percent), social services provision (14 percent),
infastructure (9 percent). The remaining projects were of a capacity building (8 percent) or
multi-sectoral nature (11 percent). It is expected that, in line with the stabilization of the
situation, the focus of the CRRP will shift from food security to the rehabilitation of social and
economic infastrucure.

14. IMPLEMENTATION PLANS AND MONITORING
INDICATORS
Implementstion Plans
14.1  The Project will be implemented by NCRRR and the Executive Secretariat of NCDDR.
The CRRP is integrated into the national programs that these two GOSL agencies will implement,
namely the NRRRP and the DDR Program, respectively. The DDR Program specifically targets
ex-combatants and provides for their special needs during a transition period until they can
participate on par with other civilians in the broad-based national program, i.e. the NRRRP. Both
national programs will be implemented through central level units, regional and, in the case of
NCRRR, district offices described in the previous Sections of this Technical Annex. These
technical units and offices have prepared detailed semi-annual work plans that have been used to
estimated the critical input requirements of the NCRRR and NCDDR under the Project as well as
for other funding sources.
14.2  The implementation plans, which cover the period from October 1999 to March 2000, are
shown in Attachment 8. This first six month period of Project implementation is partly financed
hrough the PPF and focuses on: (i) fully operationalizing the national and regional offices of
NCRRR and NCDDR (including hiring staf equipping, furnishing, and establishing systems and
procedures for Project implementation); (ii) expanding on the financing and monitoring of
activities under the ERSF and TEP; (ni) developing and disseminating sensitization materials and
messages; and (iv) contracting and mobilizing key technical assistance including that for the
FMPU, ERSF implementation, social and economic reintegration, and Project monitoring and
evaluation.
14.3  This six-month planning time fiame was considered appropriate for the CRRP due to the
shorter overall time frame of the Project, the emergency nature of the activities, and the dynamic
and rapidly changing environment in which the Project is operating. The Government will
review and update these plans every six months to coincide with the Bank's semi-annual
supervision missions. Regional office and central unit staff of NCDDR and NCRRR will have
responsibility for preparing detailed semi-annual plans that will be consolidated at national level
and used to monitor progress in implementing the Project. The preparation of these plans will be
timed to coincide with semi-annual supervision missions.
14.4  At operational levels, the DDR and RRR Programs are subject to different factors that
influence the chosen approach to implementation. Pertinent considerations are sunmnaized
below.
The ARRRP
14.5 The NRRRP focuses on resettling internally displaced people and refugees resulting from
eight years of conflict, reviving basic social services and economic activity in the conmunuites
affected by the war, and rebuilding social capital through reintegration and reconciliation. Project
support of the NRRRP focuses on financing of the ERSF and related institutional support to



TechnicalAnmex                      Project Title: Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation

NCRRR and implementing partners. Institutional support to NCRRR pnncipally will take the
form of the provision of required goods and equipment, technical assistance, staff and other
operating cost inputs. With the exception of on-going operating costs, most of these inputs will
be provided within the first nine months of Project implementation. It is expected that
institutional support to national implementing partners will be provided during the first 12 to
18 months of Project implementation.
14.6   Under the ERSF, sub-project implementation plans will be developed by implementing
partners as a requirement of the sub-project proposal process. Given the demand nature of the
Fund, these plans can not, a pnon, be specified but rather will vary depending on the type of
activity and implementing agency involved. Each such plan, and its related budget and
performance monitoring indicators, will become part of the contract that the Government will
enter into with the implementing partners. Reviewing, approving and monitoring of sub-project
activities will represent the majority of the regional and national NCRRR implementation plans.
This work is currently being piloted under the PPF.
7he NDDRP
14.7 The DDR Program will be implemented in phases between July 1998 and January 2001.
In totaL Phase I will target up to 13,000 ex-combatants consisting of 8,000 detained AFSL and
RUF combatants and 5,000 members of the CDF. Child combatants and disabled combatants
would be targeted for inclusion in Phase I. Phases II and Im would target 10,000 CDF
combatants each, as well as an undetermined number of RUF combatants'7.
14.8  Phase I was initiated in July 1998 with the opening of the Lungi Demobilization Center
(LDC) and the screening and registration of approximately 3,000 ex-combatants, however,
activities were suspended in late December 1998, and the LDC closed, in response to an
escalation of hostilities in-country and deterioration in the security situation. After a hiatus of
approximately four months following the attack on Freetown, the Program has been restartd and
the Lungi Center reopened. The government, with the support of key stakeholders that include
ECOMOG, UNOMSIL, the Office of the Special Envoy, and DFID-financed technical assistance,
have moved ahead with the critical activities called for under the Lome Agreement. The DDR
Program was formally launched on October 20di, 1999, and the Government is set to open four
additional Demobilization Centers in later October so that combatants who have presented
themselves and their weapons to UNOMSIL and ECOMOG at associated reception centers can
begin the DDR process.
14.9  Based on the Joint Operational Plan  for Disarmament and Demobilization
(August 24, 1999) and subsequent planning documents of the DDR Program, it is expected that
the discharge of all ex-combatants handled under Phase I would be completed by May, 2000.
The relevant plans for Phase I activities are shown in Attachment 9. Detailed planning for the
subsequent phases of the DDR Program will be a critical activity under Phase I.
7 These numbers of ex-c ants reflect the oigina DDR Pmgram esiate made in July 1998, and not
the revised estmate included in the Lomn Peace Agreement

CRRP Performance Monitoring
14.10 Performance monitoring of the CRRP will build on the monitoring and evaluation
activities of NCRRR and NCDDR, as well as on independent assessments. These will focus on
two levels: first, at overall program level for the NRRRP and the NDDRP (development
objectives, outcomes and core assumptions and preconditions), and second, at detailed project
(i.e., CRRP) component and activity level (outputs, implementation, managerial efficiency,
detailed program assumptions). A Logical Framework summary matrix (Project Summary Table)
is presented in Attachment 3, which includes a list of performance indicators for program
objectives and outcomes, and CRRP outputs and inputs, as well as, core assumptions and related
risks. These indicators will be used to measure the performance of the NDDRP and NRRRP, as
well as the CRRP. For each program and Project component, similar but more detailed matrices
will be developed and fed in to the overall M&E System.
National Program Level Monitoring: Devdopment Objectives and Related
Assumpdons and Risks
14.11 The development objective for the NDDRP is the "consolidation of the national security
situation and social stability in Sierra Leone", and for the NRRRP it is the "social and economic
revival of war-affected communities". Overall program monitoring will seek to provide policy
level decision makers with adequate information and analysis in regards to these broad objectives
of the two national programs. Specifically, the focus for the NDDRP would be on the broader
program impact on the security situation in the country and on the impact of successful
demobilization on the promotion of social stability. Program monitoring of the NRRRP will focus
on the reintegration of target groups and the revival of social and economic activities at
community level. The main mechanisms used for this level of monitoring will be regular joint
multi-donor reviews, regular meetings of the NCDDR and of NCRRR's Inter-Ministerial Steering
Committee, supplemented with project specific or national survey data that is independent of the
day-to-day operations of the two institutions responsible for overseeing the implementation of the
national programs and the CRRP.
Conponent and Activiy Level Monitoring
14.12 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Systems will be designed and set-up at the NCRRR
and the Executive Secretariat of the NCDDR. The two systems will be developed using the same
software platform, and be compatible in terms of coding of basic data. Thus it will be possible to
follow ex-combatants from the targeted program (i.e., the NDDRP) to the broad-based program
(i.e., NRRRP). (See also the section on 'Design Principles' below).
14.13 The M&E system of NCRRR will allow the Commission to (i) analyze the effectiveness
of the ERSF review process; (ii) quantify sub-project outputs by sector, by region, and by
beneficiary type - including ex-combatants - and gender; (iii) assess level and quality of
community and local institutional participation in sub-project design and implementation; and
(iv) measure the impact of assistance in terms of increased agricultural production, expansion of
social services, increased economic activity, and strengthening of community institutions.
14.14 The M&E system of the NCDDR will enable the Executive Secretariat to, among others:
(i) establish detailed, gender desegregated, socioeconomic baselines/profiles; (ii) trace overtime
participation of individual ex-combatants in the DDRP (reception of assistance package,

palticipation orientation, training and reintegration activities); (iii) assess implementation
efficiency; (iv) assess the level of social and economic reintegration of ex-combatants.
14.15 Given the innovative nature of the CRRP's delivery mechanisms (namely the ERSF and
the TEP), and the fact tbat the Government's executing insfitutions (namely NCRRR and
NCDDR) are newly established organizations, the Bank will also be concemed with that data
which indicates if the systems and institutions have been established and are operating efficiently.
Therefore, the Bank will monitor how quickly the respective institutions finalize the hiring of key
Project staff, and operationalize the respective central and regional offices, and sub-project
review committees. Timely submission of all Project related reports (quarterly statements of
accounts, quarterly progress reports, and semi-annual audit reports) will also serve as a measure
of institutional capacity. The Bank also will monitor closely the effective operation of the
FMPU, based on the quarterly consultancy reports to be provided by the contracted firm; the
timeliness and accuracy of SOE's, payment requests, and other applications and withdrawals; and
the quality of procurement documentation submitted to IDA for non-objection.
Main focus for monitoring
14.16 The performance indicators presented in program and Project summary matrices are
measures that will enable the respective levels of management to closely follow pertinent issues
related the efficiency, effect and impact of the national programs and the CRRP. Table 14-1 on
the following page indicates the monitoring levels discussed in the preceding paragraphs, related
areas of focus, and means of data collection for NRRRP, NDDRP, and CRRP performance
monitoring.
Monitoring Responsibilities and Reporting
14.17 NRRRP. The Directorate of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) of NCRRR
will have overall responsibility for monitoring and preparing quarterly progress reports on the
implementation of the NRRRP and those elements of the CRRP for which the Commission is
responsible. The national level Program Manager for M&E, and the regional ERSF Projects
Officers will take day-to-day responsibility for ensuring that data is collected and entered into the
M&E system and analyzed. In particular, these staff will be responsible for standardizing the
monitoring indicators and data collection formats, assisting implementing partners to develop
monitoring plans for each sub-project, and compiling sub-project data for overall Project progress
review and assessment of performance. The Director of DPME will be responsible for preparing
the quarterly progress reports that will contain consolidated information on NRRRP and Project
performance. Implementing partners will provide NCRRR with monthly physical and financial
progress reports on ERSF sub-project implementation.
14.18 NDDRP. The Executive Secretary of NCDDR is responsible for the preparation of
quarterly progress reports on the targets and timeframes set in the NDDRP and the CRRP
implementation plans. The Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of the Executive Secretariat will:
(i) design formats and questionnaires to capture socioeconomic and adminisaive information
and ensure that these sets of information are consistenly entered in the DDRP database;
(ii) maintain and continuously up date the program's M&E database (iii) analyze the data, prepare
cross tabulations and summaries as per the instructions of the Executive Secretary; (iv) compile
data for program Progress reports; (v) prepare Socioeconomic Profile and Monitoring Reports.

14.19 The analysis of quantitative socioeconomic and administation related data will be
supplemented by mainly qualitative Beneficiary Assessments. These will be commissioned by
the Executive Secretariat and implemented by independent consultants. In addition, independent
interim evaluations will be commissioned after each Phase of DDRP implementation. Interim
Evaluation Reports will be available for joint donor reviews/supervision mission.

Design prinpla for the M&E System
14.22 The M&E System for both institutions will consist of: (i) agreed procedures for data
collection laid down in a Monitoring and Evaluation Procedures Manual; (ii) standardized
formats for questionnaires, administrative forms, overview reports; (iii) a database documented in
a Data Dictionary; and (iv) regular and ad hoc reports for senior management of the DDRP and
NCRRR
14.23 M&E data collection procedures should ensure that data collection is comprehensive as
well as cost effective. Typically this implies that data collection must take place in conjunction
with 'administrative occasions'.  For example, the first socioeconomic questionnaire for the



TechnicalAnnex                     Project Title: Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation
Counhy: Sierra Leone                                                 Page 87 of 87
DDRP is administered when ex-combatants are given their NCDDR Identification Cards. A
follow up survey will be in conjunction with any occasion that involves all ex-combatants, such
as for example, the payment of the second installment of the reinsertion package. NCRRR will
collect relevant baseline data on implementing partner agencies at the same time that each
organization submits a proposal to the ERSF.
14.24 As was indicated in previous sections, the set up of the M&E Systems for the Project and
the respective national programs is a work in progress and is being supported under the PPF
advance through technical assistance. The following design principles will be followed in the
development and implementation of the system.
For the NDDRP
1.   A comprehensive socioeconomic baseline (including a skills assessment and intended
economic activity) will be established for all ex-combatants.
2.    Follow-up on socio-economic developments (reintegration) will be done in conjunction
with those administative occasions (mainly payments) that involve all ex-combatants.
3.    Subsets of information will be collected in conjunction with the implementation of
activities not necessarily involving all ex-combatants (training, participation in RRR
financed projects, special projects for disabled persons or child ex-combatants).
4.    To manage and store the data, the Executive Secretariat will maintain, and where relevant
expand, a relational database using the NCDDR Administive Number of the ex-
combatants as the key identifying field.
5.   The Monitoring Unit of the Executive Secretariat will at technical level liaise with
collaborating organizations and institutions to ensure th-at data sets on ex-combatants can
be linked across the databases used by these institutions. Thus, collaborating institutions
such as NCRRR and UNICEF should add the NCDDR Administrative Number to their
respective data sets.
For the NRRRP
1.   Where one does not already exist, a baseline will be established for each sub-project as
part of the preliminary sub-project activities.
2.   Implementing partners will provide essential Project output information to NCRRR as part
of their monthly progress reporting requirements, this data will be periodically verified by
NCRRR staff through site visits.
3.    Measuring the impact of Project activities on the overall development objectives of the
NRRRP will be the responsibility of independent outside evaluators and would draw on
data available from relevant line ministries and NGOs.

implement as soon as possible the provision of the Cease-fire Agreement which was signed on 18 May
1999 in Lome, relating to the immediate release of prisoners of war and non-combatants.
Both sides reaffirmed the importance of the implementation of this provision in the interest of the

of war and non-combatants.
Both the Government of Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary United Front of Sierra Leone decided that
such a Committee be established by the UN and chaired by the UN Chief Military Observer in Sierra
Leone and comprising representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), UNICEF
and other relevant UN Agencies and NGOs.
This Committee should begin its work immediately by contacting both parties to the conflict with a view
to effecting the immediate release of these prisoners of war and non-combatants.

TORS: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND PROCUREMENT
UNIT (DRAFT)
Background
Subsequent to the restoration of democracy and the revival of recovery efforts following more than
seven years of civil war and unrest, the Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) is embarking on an
ambitious program of activities for national recovery and reintegration that will be supported by the
World Bank, the African Development Bank, the UK Department for International Development,
and other donor organizations. The National Programmes for: (i) Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and
Resettlement (RRR) and for (ii) Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) will
facilitate and finance reintegration support for ex-combatants and resettlement of refugees and
displaced people, rehabilitation of social and economic infrastructure, local institutional capacity
building and reconciliation assistance.
Two institutions will be the principal executing agencies under the World Bank, AfDB and other
donor supported projects: the National Commission for Rehabilitation, Reconstruction, and
Resettlement (NCRRR) and the National Committee on Disarmament, Demobilization, and
Reintegration (NCDDR). Both agencies are newly established and are temporary institutions that
will serve for a finite period of time to set the overall policy for the national programmes; ensure
adequate and appropriate coordination among and between relevant governmental, non-
governmental, and donor partners; and monitor implementation of specific sub-project activities.
Partner organizations including local and international non-governmental organizations, community
based organizations, UN agencies, line ministry departments, and private business will take principal
responsibility for the implementation of the project as sub-contractors.
The NCRRR will seek to facilitate national reconstruction activities through a demand driven social-
fund type financing mechanism (the Emergency Recovery Support Fund-- ERSF) that will support
community based sub-projects aimed at restoring economic and social infrastructure, promoting
reconciliation, and strengthening local institutions. Appropriate sub-projects will be identified by
war-affected populations and communities and designed and implemented in collaboration with
local and international NGOs, line ministries and other partners active and experienced in the
geographic and sectoral areas of concern. NCRRR, working through district-level officers, regional
offices, and inter-agency committees, will review and approve sub-project proposals, enter into
contract agreements with various implementing partners, and monitor the physical and financial
progress of sub-project implementation.
The NCDDR will oversee the GOSL commitment and efforts to completly disarm, demobilise and
reintegrate (i) an estimated 8,000 combatants of the Armed Forces of Sierra Leone (AFSL) and the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) currently under Government control and (ii) an estimated 25,000
combatants of the Civil Defence Forces (CDF). The primary objectives are the consolidation of
security and the sustainable social and economic reintegration of ex-combatants. The disarmament,

demobilisation and reintegration programme if implemented in a transparent and equitable manner,
could serve as an important pull factor for those combatants still holding out in the bush, provided a
conductive security environment is promoted. The Executive Secretariat of the NCDDR would be
responsible for ensuring: (i) the planning and implementation of the individual programme
components in collaboration with other government departments, NGOs and donors; (ii) the
transparent and accountable administration of the programme; and (iii) monitoring and evaluation.
An important financial and management control aspect of the DDR Programme will be the payment
of reintegration allowances to all ex-combatants noted above, and contracting and support for a
training and employment fund.
NCRRR and NCDDR are new institutions with limited experience administering donor-financed
project activities. In addition, the Government recognizes the need for the highest degree of
transparency and accountability in the operation and administration of the national programmes to:
(i) satisfy the requirements of donor agencies considering financial support to the GOSL efforts;
(ii) encourage implementing partners to continue collaborating with the Commission and the
Committee in the national recovery and reintegration process; and (iii) to reassure the public in
general as to the seriousness and commitment of the Government in redressing the damage and
causes of the civil war. Therefore, the GOSL intends to seek local and international technical
expertise to implement the financial management and procurement responsibilities for the
Emergency Recovery Support Fund and other donor-financed activities and support to the NCRRR
and NCDDR. Proposals will be sought from a short-list of qualified local and international firms.
The successful bidder will set-up and manage the Financial Management and Procurement Unit
(FMPU). This unit will have responsibility for all financial management functions, contracting, and
procurement procedures on behalf of the NCRRR and NCDDR. All costs associated with setting up
and operating the FMPU will be defined by the bidders and should be included in the Financial
Proposal. The bidders will have complete responsibility for identifying and hiring all local and
international staff deemed necessary to fulfil the responsibilities of the FMPU. The unit will be
managed by a qualified and experienced senior professional with experience in the design and
implementation of an appropriate financial management and internal control system for the Project
and Programme of this nature. Additional staff of accountants and other professionals will be
required as necessary to assist with disbursement, accounting, expenditure reviews, internal control
and project and sub-project procurement issues. An illustrative list of professional staff for the

2.    Reporting Responsibilities
The Financial Management and Procurement Unit (FMPU) will be an autonomous body that
provides service for, and reports to, the National Commission for Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and
Resettlement, and to the National Committee on Disarnament, Demobilisation and Reintegration.
The FMPU will ensure that all contracting, procurement, disbursement and financial management
functions required under the two national programmes are carried out in accordance with standard
and accepted guidelines of the donor agencies supporting these two programmes. The Unit Manager
of the FMPU will report to the Commissioner of NCRRR and the Executive Secretary of NCDDR,
respectively, for the different monies provided to the GOSL for the respective programmes. The
FMPU will assist both NCRRR and NCDDR prepare all financial management reports, payment

Sierra Leone                                                    Attachment 5: Page 5 of 15
3.    Resources Management Responsibilities
It is estimated that the FMPU will have responsibility for overseeing the management of up to
US$50 million, however, currently proposed resources amount to around US$30 million. Of this
total, approximately $25 million will finance sub-projects implemented by partner organisations
active in the areas of resettlement, reconstruction, rehabilitation, training, etc. These activities will
be funded through sub-contract arrangements (ranging from $10,000 to $500,000 in value) for which
the FMPU will have financial monitoring responsibility. Implementing partners may be non-
governmental organisations, line ministry units, or community based organisations currently active
in Sierra Leone. The proposed financial mechanisms for the disbursement and control of funds
through these sub-contracts is discussed in detail in the attached document Operational Manualfor
the Emergency Recovery Support Fund (ERSF). The remaining $5 million will go toward
institutional support of the NCRRR and NCDDR; including the purchase of goods, equipment,
vehicles, technical assistance, and the payment of operating costs-- for which the FMPU will have
some responsibility for assisting with the procurement, disbursement and financial management.
In addition, it is expected that the FMPU will manage the mechanism for disbursing reintegration
payments to ex-combatants (to be done in either one or two payments, and either at central pre-
discharge centres, or in a limited number of regional centres or designated locations). It is currently
estimated that approximately 35,000 ex-combatants will receive some form of cash payment, a
control system for which will have to be developed by the FMPU. More specific details of the
proposed cash transfer arrangements for ex-combatants is provided in the attached document on the
Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration Program.
The successful proposal must take into consideration the challenges posed by the current situation in
Sierra Leone and present a realistic approach to the issues raised by these programme elements and
respective responsibilities of the FMPU.
4.    Organizational structure
The FMPU will be managed by a firm with relevant international experience and track record in
similar donors funded projects involving similarly qualified personnel. The FMPU will be managed
by a senior Unit Manager, and be comprised of three units.
I -   Accounting and Disbursement Section: This section will be divided in two sub-
sections that will be responsible for the financial accounting and budgeting systems
(special account, disbursement) of NCRRR and NCDDR respectively. The two sub-
sections will co-ordinate and segregate the management of RRR and DDR funds.
Two line Accounting Managers (one for each institution) will be assigned to handle
the day-to-day financial transactions and accounting for each institution.
2 -   Procurement Section:  This section will ensure that all donors procurement
arrangements are strictly followed and enforced according to their requirements and
guidelines. In particular, the unit will be responsible for the preparation of necessary
bid documents, and will assist NCRRR and NCDDR with the procurement of



Technical Annex                                    Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation
Sierra Leone                                                    Attachment 5: Page 6 of 15
approximately US$1 million of goods. The section may also provide some
assistance to partner organisations implementing sub-projects to prepare simplified
bid documents (for small-scale civil works) or to bulk procure some inputs such as
fertilizer.
3 -   Internal Control Section: This section will be managed by a Control Officer and will
be responsible for ensuring that all elements of the internal control system are carried
out efficiently. The unit will conduct, inter alia, random checking of payments
effected to various beneficiaries; verify that contracts and goods or services, etc.
have been executed and delivered by various contractors and suppliers as agreed; and
ensure that the internal procedures of both NCRRR and NCDDR are properly applied
by the staff of the institutions.
5.    Staffing
The FMPU will be headed by a qualified and experienced senior management professional with
experience in public administration, accounting, or project management with more than 10 years of
professional experience. The Manager of the Unit will oversee the work of the FMPU and report
directly to the Commissioner of NCRRR and the Executive Secretary of the NCDDR. It is expected
that the Manager will be supported by three to four professional staff who will be responsible for the
day-to-day accounting, procurement and internal control functions of the Unit.
Additional local staff will be required as necessary to assist with accounting, disbursement, control,
expenditure review and project and sub-project procurement issues. It is expected that the FMPU
will have an adequate complement of junior professional and support staff to fulfill its
responsibilities. The specific number and type of support staff to be present in the FMPU will be left
up to the discretion of the private institution awarded the contract for the set-up and operation of the
FMPU.
The consultant firm will be responsible for the recruitement, hiring and compensation of all staff of
the FMPU.
6.    Special and Project Accounts
The GOSL (through the Ministry of Finance) will authorize the FMPU to open and operate
necessary special and project accounts on behalf of NCRRR and NCDDR for donors and GOSL
counterpart funding programmes. The FMPU will manage these accounts and make payments to
vendors, contractors and individual beneficiaries (in the case of ex-combatants) once authorized to
do so by NCRRR and NCDDR. All accounts managed by FMPU will be operated with two
signatures, of which one must always be the FMPU Manager. For funds that support NCRRR
activities, either the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner, NCRRR, will counter-sign checks; for
funds that support NCDDR activities, either the Executive Secretary or his representative will
counter-sign. Special payment requests and withdrawal applications for replenishment to donors
must also be signed by the authorized representative of the Ministry of Finance upon request by
either the Executive Secretary of NCDDR or the Commissioner of NCRRR.

7.    Audit
By law in Sierra Leone, the GOSL Auditor General is responsible for auditing public funds.
However, considering the heavy volume of work already assigned to the Auditor General's
Department, the exceptional situation, and logistic adjustment the Government ministries and
agencies are going through, and that the continuing viability of the ERSF and DDR programmes
demands prompt periodic auditing of their accounts, it is recommend that the Auditor General
delegate the auditing of the ERSF and DDR funds to an external auditing firm appointed by him for
that purpose. Semi-annual audits will be required of all accounts under the control of the FMPU.
8.    Timing, Duration and Work Station
The contract for the FMPU Consultant firn will be for three (3) years, subject to performance. It is
expected that the contract for these technical assistance services would be signed between the GOSL
and the successful bidder towards the end of CY 1998. Therefore, all responsive bids must indicate
that all proposed staff would be able to take up post by this time.
All staff of the FPMU will be based in Freetown, Sierra Leone, however, some travel will be
required to the provincial cities and district headquarters in order to assist in monitoring the regional
financial officers and implementing partners. It is expected that FMPU staff will be required to
travel up-country approximately 5 days per quarter.
9.    Services, Equipment and Materials Provided by GOSL
The Government will provide to the Consultant all necessary licenses, pernits, duty-free waivers for
office equipment and for personal goods of expatriate staff, and relevant reports, etc., necessary for the
set up and operation of the FMPU. However, all required goods, equipment, furnishings and other
essential inputs needed for the Financial Management and Procurement Unit should be included as part
of the Consultants Financial Proposal.

DDR Program: Reintegration Component;
Considerations and Technical Assistance Needs
1.    Background
The GOSL has demonstrated solid commitment to the DDR as evidenced by a credible process, shaped
by clear and consistent policy pronouncement, supported with a functioning policy committee unit and an
Executive Secretariat - both constituting the institutional framework for managing and coordinating the
DDR program.
However limited financial resources and sporadic incursions by the rebel forces represent major
challenges to the initiation of a comprehensive disarmament, demobilization and reintegration program.
Compounding the process is the urgency of time, which holds out the inevitable option of a planning and
implementation depth atypical of conventional DDR programs. Designed to take place in a very difficult
socio-economic environment, the process offers limited possibilities for creating stable livelihoods in the
short term. Consequently, the envisaged reintegration of 2,200 members of the ex-AFSL and the
captured/surrendered members of the RUF currently encamped in Lungi garrison, is fraught with a
considerable number of complexities.
The process of initial military screening, registration, socio-economic profiling of the target groups, pre-
discharge orientation activities (socio-psychological counseling, civic education as well as vocational and
skills orientation) and discharge are planned to take place between August 1998 and January 1999 - a
five month timeframe considered insufficient by any standard. Although the cumulative and extended
period of encampment has engendered an intense and restless feeling of uneasiness among the
combatants, it has also fostered an expectation of quick discharge and reintegration into civilian life - an
expectation that cannot be overlooked in the planning and implementation of the reintegration process.
The reintegration component of the DDR program is envisioned to be an integral part of an overall
national reconciliation and reconstruction strategy. It is proposed that demobilization will take place in
three phases, between July 1998 and January 2000. Phase I, referring to the currently detained
AFSL/RUF ex-combatants in Lungi (LDC), was scheduled for July 1998 to January 1999. However, to
facilitate the reintegration of these ex-combatants into civilian life a concerted effort needs to be put in
place, involving all stakeholders, to develop a careful and realistic strategy which can be implemented in
the very near future.
In this respect the Government of Sierra Leone faces considerable challenges. These challenges need to
be met to avoid the many risks associated with re-entry of ex-combatants into a civilian society
devastated and traumatized by a protracted and destructive civil war.
The planning process of the DDR reintegration component will address two immediate issues. Firstly, a
series of activities need to be in place at LDC to ensure that the already started demobilization and
reintegration process of ex-AFSL in the camp can proceed in an appropriate and meaningful manner. It
should be recalled that prior to the launching of the improved camp management and the provision of
food and other basic needs by DFID considerable tension had been building up in and around LDC.
Recent improvement of living conditions and the ongoing registration and profiling exercise have
improved the morale in LCD. A failure to follow through with concrete social and economic reintegration



Technical Annex                                     Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation
Sierra Leone                                                      Attachment 7: Page 2 of 14
initiatives during the encampment period may have a great impact on the success or failure of the entire
demobilization process. The social and political viability of the remainder of the DDRP could therefore
be at risk.
Secondly, a detailed and credible plan for the reinsertion and reintegration of the subsequent phases of the
DDRP needs to be developed. This plan needs to take into account the significant different starting points
for social and economic reintegration for the ex-AFSL, ex-RUF and ex-CDF combatants, respectively.
The design and planning of the social and economic reintegration measures needs to be consistent with
the following overall principles:
*   Targeted assistance to ex-combatants will only be provided during the reinsertion phase;
*  From the outset, longer-term reintegration assistance to ex-combatants will make optimal
use of the mechanisms established under the RRR;
*  Assistance to vulnerable groups such as female ex-combatants, disabled ex-combatants and
child ex-combatants needs to utilize and strengthen the existing in-country capacity of
organizations already on the ground.
2.    Strategy Framework for Social and Economic Reintegration
To prepare the ex-combatants adequately for their re-entry into civilian life, the DDR reintegration
framework needs to incorporate the following components:
* Social reintegration, including both socio-psychological counseling and civic education;
* These components are intended to address psychological factors, which distort patterns of
behavior while providing the ex-combatants with positive attitudes towards civic
responsibilities, respect for democratic culture and skills for conflict resolution.
Economic reintegration, including vocational and post-discharge orientation. The focus of economic
reintegration is to equip the ex-combatants with productive skills and options for employment as effective
means to successful transition to civilian life.  The proposed Training and Employment Fund,
employment-intensive public works and promotion of artisan enterprise development are variety of
programs designed to serve this purpose and provide linkage with the emergency recovery social fund.
Community sensitization and information campaign:
* A major precondition for successful reintegration of ex-combatants is the receptiveness of
their various communities regarding their return and resettlement. Pervasive feelings of
mistrust, animosity and other forms of social tension engendered by war calls for a
systematic process of re-engineering social relationships and perceptions. Conversely, to
accommodate reintegration of ex-combatants, specific attitudinal transformation needs to be
inculcated in the returning ex-combatants to prepare them for eventual reintegration in the
local communities. These processes require the design of a comprehensive program of
community sensitization and information dissemination.
Within the context of the DDR program, an Information and Community Sensitization is anticipated to
focus on (i) the ex-combatants currently encamped in Lungi; (ii) the intended communities of return;
(iii) as well as a nationwide audience. Detailed planning for each component needs to be developed
within a couple of weeks with overlapping and incremental implementation process. The constraints of



Technical Annex                                       Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation
Sierra Leone                                                        Attachment 7: Page 3 of 14
time not only demand concurrent planning but also simultaneous implementation of the strategy
components.
3.    Analysis of expectation and target group profiles
During the registration of the ex-combatants a short socio-economic profile will be established. These
socio-economic profiles form the baseline infornation on educational background, professional
experience and future professional expectations of the ex-combatants. The analysis of these profiles
should provide useful information to the reintegration planners and implementers in terms of areas of
district of re-settlement, the requirements to facilitate return to the respective districts, intended
occupations and relevant skills requirements. The socio-economic data collected from the registration
process and from the rapid inventory of skills among the ex-combatants are essential to program both
social and economic reintegration initiatives. Convergence of skills with chosen district of settlement and
opportunities for employment in the local labor market are crucial in achieving anticipated results of any
vocational improvement and employment generation program.
4.    Training needs assessment and identification of skills gaps
To support the social and economic reintegration process it is further recommended to carry out a rapid
training needs assessment in the formal and informal sectors of the Sierra Leone economy. This training
needs assessment could be carried out through an establishment survey and/or through the use of rapid
urban and rural appraisal techniques. Parallel to this training needs assessment a rapid appraisal of
economic opportunities could be carried out. More insight into the skill requirements of the labor market
and potential market niches will enable the ex-combatants to make a more informed choice regarding
their employment and income generating opportunities. This type of assessment would also inform
training providers about the current level and quantity of skills demand, identify the skill gaps and
facilitate the design of means to fill these gaps.
5.    Local implementation capacity and requirement for upgrading
A rapid assessment of local capacity will provide a valid basis for a rational choice of implementing
partners in the reintegration program. The capacity of existing local institutions to deliver the required
program for skills improvement and to participate in the reconstruction and rehabilitation program
remains unclear. Considerable looting and destruction of the facilities of most local institutions remains a
major constrain. This becomes obvious when contrasted against the sizeable capital investment required
to upgrade their equipment. Under the current time constraints, the mission recommends to initiate
immediate pilot activities to test the potential for upgrading capacity of local institutions to provide on-
site training orientation and other components of the reintegration program for the phase 1 operation in
Lungi. However, balancing the requirement for upgrading of local institutional capacity against the
exigency of engaging foreign expertise remains a delicate decision that will influence the quality, time
and cost of program delivery. Technical Assistance will be required to assist in the design of program and
management of the process.

6.    Options for reintegration
During the encampment the possibilities for organizing an extensive skills training program will be
limited due to the time constraints under which the reintegration program is being developed. However,
the data and information to be derived from the socio-economic profiles, the economic opportunities and
training needs assessment, and the assessment of local implementation capacities are essential building
blocks for developing an appropriate vocational orientation program for the ex-combatants. The
vocational orientation would have to be planned and implemented with the assistance of local training
providers who have developed or are in the process of developing tailor-made short courses for ex-
combatants. Within the framework of this orientation, the possibility of organizing on-site workshops and
on-site trade exhibitions would have to be explored with those training providers. Such workshops or
such an exhibition of the use and content of a variety of skills would facilitate a more informed career
choice for the ex-combatants. A more comprehensive training program will be developed and provided
within the context of the Training and Employment Fund.
After the discharge, a rmenu of different social and economic reintegration options could be available to
the ex-combatants. Recent plans for reintegration assistance in other post-conflict situations have
included all, a combination of or some of the following:
- Rehabilitation of basic social, economic and physical infrastructure;
Revitalization of basic social services;
* Community-based rural development programs;
L Labor-intensive public works programs;
- Agricultural programs
- Skill development in technical and/or entrepreneurial skills to facilitate employment or self-
employment (including apprenticeships);
- Adult education (literacy, numeracy, life-skills, etc.);
* Self-employment through the creation of small and micro enterprises;
*  Provision of micro-credit, self-employment tool kits, and support services (counseling and
guidance, job placement, etc.) for assisting reintegration into different activities;
*  Targeted activities for vulnerable groups, such as, disabled ex-combatants, child soldiers,
etc.;
Within the context of the DDR reintegration component, it is important to recommend realistic options to
the ex-combatants. DDR will therefore be responsible for the provision of counseling and referral
services at the regional and district level, which will provide ex-combatants with information about
potential opportunities for employment, participation in the private sector, and community-based
reconstruction and rehabilitation activities. It is important to note that in principle the implementation
strategy of the CRRP is to use a community-based demand driven project identification and development
process. Ex-combatants will additionally have access to an employment, vocational training and
apprenticeship fund known as the regional Training and Employment Fund (TEF). The TEF will facilitate
access to apprenticeships or other skills training, and will subsidize employment opportunities where
possible.
As far as post-discharge social reintegration is concerned, a community sensitization and information
campaign for ex-combatants, communities and the general public will be essential. This has already been
emphasized by GOSL as an issue of overarching importance. Important steps have been taken so far,
including public announcement of the terms and conditions of the DDRP as well as a high profile
televised debate and information program on the DDRP. These initiatives need to be followed up by a

more detailed and well-planned sensitization campaign. Such a campaign would have the following
elements: (i) immediate community level sensitization in and around LDC based on, and in collaboration
with, the considerable potential of local groups, networks and individuals that each in their own way are
working towards practical community based reconciliation; (ii) a national level campaign, through the
print media, radio and television and other appropriate means; (iii) sensitization in the region prior to and
in concurrence with the establishment of the DDRP's Regional Reintegration Offices; (iv) community
level campaigns in preparation for the return of ex-combatants. It is furthennore essential that this
sensitization campaign links up concretely with the different youth development activities and the
participatory consultation exercises that are currently being undertaken by various local and international
organizations.
7.    Design consideration and implementation requirements.
Major design considerations are as follows:
*   Relevance and quality of the content of training program and other forms of reintegration
assistance to the ex-combatants to constitute sufficient inducement and motivation to
participate in on-camp and off-camp programs.
*   Capacity for rapid and on-site deployment by delivering agencies contracted to implement
specific component of the reintegration program is vital for flexibility in the design and
implementation of the program
*   Options for incremental reintegration through public works-labor-intensive programs and
phased assistance to support initial re-insertiation allowance are critical to reducing not only
a dominant impression of rewarding rebellion but also fostering community acceptance of
the ex-combatants.
*   Orientation towards acquisition of life-skills and enterprise development support should
drive the process of vocational training and other reintegration assistance. Within this
context, the option of private sector participation should be explored.
8.    Technical Assistance Requirements
Within the context of the DDR reintegration program technical assistance will be required to assist the
Secretariat in the planning and design of the reintegration activities for the ex-combatants currently
encamped in Lungi. It is recommended to provide the Secretariat with a social reintegration specialist, an
economic reintegration specialist and a community sensitization specialist. The terms of reference for
these positions are attached.

Draft Terms of Reference
Reinsertion and Reintegration Unit Manager
National Committee for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (NCDDR)
Executive Secretariat
Background
In June 1998, following more than seven years of civil war and illegal junta rule, the recently
reinstated Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) took the initiative to develop a comprehensive
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) program aimed at dealing with an estimated
35,000 ex-combatants including members of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Armed Forces of
sierra Leone, and the Civil Defense Forces. Considerable progress was made to initiate work under this
DDR program during the last six months, however, an upsurge in fighting in late 1998, culminating in an
attack on and battle for Freetown in early January 1999, resulted in the suspension of the program.
ECOMOG forces were able to re-establish security in Freetown and Western region and cleared major
highways to allow access to the country.
Subsequent to the attack on Freetown, there is a growing understanding that for sustainable long-
term peace and security in the country, a political settlement is preferable. Consequently the UN, in
concert with major bilateral partners, facilitated a peace negotiation between rebel leader Sankoh and
RUF commanders as well as the Government and other Rebel groups. The outcome was the Lome Peace
Agreement which provided the basis for a negotiated settlement to the conflict. Under the specific
provision of the agreement, the United Nation Military Observer Mission (UNOMSIL) and Monitoring
Group of West African States (ECOMOG) will enforce cease fire and oversee the disarmament,
demobilization of all surrendered forces as part of the comprehensive DDR program.
In anticipation of a rapid resolution of the current conflict, international partners of the GOSL
made committments to assist the Government re-start and plan for the expansion of its' DDR Program.
The Program is seen as crucial in moving forward the recently negotiated peace agreement, sustain a
viable cease-fire agreement as well as provide vital momentum to sustainable peace and longer-term
security. Specifically, long-term technical assistance position would be required to manage the various
aspects of the Reintegration measures which have been identified to support successful return of
demobilised ex-combatants under the DDR program of the Executive Secretariat of the NCDDR. Given
the special nature of the DDR responsibilities, and the lack of in-country experience in these areas, as
well as to maintain credibility and neutrality in the program, it is recommended that selected candidate
will serve as unit technical manager in the related area and maintain overall responsibility for the day to
day management of the program of their respective units within Executive Secretariat of NCDDR to
which they will be attached. The responsibilities outline below represent the broad terms of reference for
the Reinsertion and Reintegration Unit Manager.
Context
The purpose of the DDR Program is to facilitate the process whereby combatants from both sides
of the conflict gradually and peacefully return to normal and productive civilian lives. Specifically, the
DDR would finance activities aimed at disarming and demobilizing combatants (including registration,
medical screening, and socio-economic profiling, pre-discharge orientation programs), providing
reinsertion assistance (including departure allowances, transitional safety net allowance and facilitating
access to land) and reintegration support (including vocational and/or non-formal education,
apprenticeships, information and referral services, counseling, community relations and civic education).

An effective Reinsertion and Reintegration program would provide for ex-combatants opportunities to
become productive members of their home communities. The opportunities would involve activities in
support of social and economic reintegration assistance beginning with the pre-discharge orientation
activities during demobilization, transitional allowances upon discharge and training, employment and
self employment upon settlement in home communities. The candidate should respond with great degree
of flexibility and creativity to the fast changing conditions on the ground.
Objective
To oversee the design and implementation of the Reinsertion and Reintegration program for
approximately 45,000 ex-combatants, that is aimed to facilitate their return to civilian life and consolidate
the peace and security and form the basis for post-war community reintegration and rehabilitation in
close consultation and co-ordination with NCRRR.
Responsibilities:
The Reinsertion and Reintegration unit Manager will report directly to the Executive Secretary , in
consultation with the chief technical advisor and other unit managers, maintain close working relationship
and co-operations with UN Agencies (ILO, WFP, UNDP, and UNICEF) NGOs, firms, and traditional
leadership. The R&R Unit Manager will be responsible for the definition, implementation, management,
and evaluation as well as revision of strategies aimed at facilitating the social, psychological and
economic reintegration of all eligible ex-combatants under the Government's DDR Program. The Unit
manager will manage day to day operation of the reinsertion and reintegration program as well as design
specific measure for promoting incremental assumption of line responsbility by a suitably identified local
counterpart.

3. Analyze the expectations, preferences and needs of ex-combatants to facilitate their successful
reintegration into Sierra Leonean society; based on these analyses, develop terms of reference and
assist with the preparation of relevant bidding documents to be used in contracting participating
organizations to implement reintegration activities;
4. Conduct the technical review of proposals in consultation with other unit managers, chief technical
advisor and approve of reintegration program activities to be financed under the DDR Program and
its Training and Employment Program (TEP) fund; refine procedures of the TEP based on the
changing circumstances.
5. In collaboration with NCRRR's Information and Sensitization Unit, identify appropriate messages
and delivery mechanisms for civic education and community sensitization activities and facilitate
dissemination through appropriate media channels and the Regional Reintegration Offices (RROs);
6. Jointly with the chief technical advisor and relevant unit managers, oversee the implementation of

Background:
A major precondition for successful reintegration of ex-combatants is the receptiveness of their various
communities regarding their return and resettlement. Pervasive feelings of mistrust, animosity and other
forms of social tension engendered by war demand the establishment of a systematic process of re-
establishing social relationships and perceptions. Conversely, to accommodate the reintegration of ex-
combatants, specific attitudinal transformation needs to be inculcated in the returning ex-combatants to
prepare them for eventual reintegration in the local communities. These processes require the design of a
comprehensive program of community sensitization and information dissemination.
Within the context of the DDR program, an Information and Community Sensitization specialist will be
required to assist the Executive Secretariat of the NCDDR and the NCRRR in the planning and design of
an information and sensitization campaign. The campaign will target (i) the ex-combatants currently
encamped in Lungi (ii) the intended communities of return (iii) as well as nationwide audience.
Initially, the task will cover a period of six weeks, starting from the second week of September 1998. If
necessary, a follow-up mission might be necessary to evaluate the impact and fine-tune the sensitization
and reintegration program. The assignment will outline activities for raising social awareness and civic
responsibilities and will essentially include the following: (i) an assessment of existing local capacities
and the framework for coordination of the process; (ii) the design of a comprehensive national strategy
on reconciliation and social rehabilitation; (iii) the development of broad content and message and (iv)
the identification of credible mechanism for the delivery of message.
Duties and Responsibilities:
The specific responsibilities of the specialist will comprise the following:
*   Analyze the capacity and identify potential implementing agencies in the field of
information and community sensitization.
*   Direct the preparation of comprehensive national strategy for community sensitization.
*   Assist implementation agencies in designing target specific programs of re-engineering
social conception regarding the ex-combatants and other war-affected groups.
*   Workout strategies for collaboration with national and international agencies currently
operating in the field of community sensitization.
*   Assess and review the effectiveness of the message and content of the community
sensitization program as well as ascertain the effectiveness of the medium of information
dissemination.
*   Develop terms of reference, procedures, criteria and performance indicators as the basis for
contracting implementing agencies and monitoring results.
*   Assist in the review and identification appropriate programs of community sensitization.
*   Elaborate implementation plans, phasing and the budgets for the Executive Secretariat.

Terms of Reference - M&E Unit manager
The monitoring and evaluation Unit Manager oversees the implementation of the unit's activities so that
timely, accurate and effective information is available for programme management and planning
purposes. It is envisioned that based in the required qualifications and experience this position will be
recruited internationally.
The core of the monitoring and evaluation unit for the NCDDR will incorporate a Unit Manager, acting
as team leader and directly responsible for interfacing with the other unit managers and the Executive
Secretary. The Unit Manager will be supported by a Data Analyst / Statistician, in charge of reporting
programme outcomes and manage all analytical procedures, a Systems Administrator who will supervise
the data entry team and will maintain the necessary systems and equipment, and a Senior Programme
Monitor in charge of the day to day follow-up of programme activities.
In order to facilitate the monitoring of on-going activities, particularly those implemented by institutional
partners, and to facilitate capturing qualitative information aboutprogramme impact, the unit will rely on
a decentralised team of Field Programme Monitors. These will liaise with the Regional Reintegration
Offices to follow-up on programme activities, maintain a running sample of beneficiaries' perceptions
and visit active implementing partners. The Field Programme Monitors be coordinated and will report to
the Senior Programme Monitor located in the central office.
The following picture depicts the proposed organisational chart for the ES-NCDDR's M&E Unit.
All positions are proposed based in the functions and responsibilities described, without
consideration for the two positions already existing in the Unit or their respective position names.
This does not mean that existing staff must not be considered for the new proposed structure, but
rather than the positions and responsibilities need to be re-examine to respond the proposed new
functions.

TORs: Project Financial Audit
Objective
The objective of the audit of the Program Financial Statement (PFS) is to enable the auditor to express a
professional opinion on the financial position of the various donors funds (World Bank, AfDB, other
Donors) allocated to the National Resettlement, Reconstruction, and Rehabilitation Program and managed
by the Financial Management and Procurement Unit (FMPU) at each fiscal year, semi-annually for three
(3) years, starting from June 30, 1999. The auditor is also required to express separate opinions on the
Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) and the Special Accounts (SA) for the funds received and
expenditures occurred for the accounting period ended at the same dates. It is also expected to express
separate opinions on the accounts for other donors according to their reporting requirements.
The program accounts (books of account) provide the basis for preparation of the PFS and are established
to reflect the financial transactions in respect of the program, as maintained by the FMPU.
Scope
The audit will be carried out in accordance with International Standards of Auditing, and will include
such tests and controls as the auditor considers necessary under the circumstances. In addition, the auditor
should pay special attention to the following:
(a)    All external funds have been used in accordance with the conditions of the relevant financing
agreements, with due attention to economy and efficiency, and only for the purposes for which
the financing was provided. Relevant financing agreement are the IDA Credit No ............. of
US$ .     for 3 years, the ADF Loan No. of U.A . ..... for 3 years, and likely other donors';
(b)    Counterpart funds have been provided and used in accordance with the relevant financing
agreements, due attention to economy and efficiency, and only for the purpose for which they
were provided;
(c)    Goods and services financed have been procured in accordance with the relevant financing
agreement;
(d)    All necessary supporting documents, records, and accounts have been kept in respect of all
program ventures [including expenditures reported via SOEs or SAs]. Clear linkages should exits
between the books of account and reports presented to the contributing donors.
(e)    The Credit account reconciliation between the amount shown as "received by the Program from
such donor" and shown as being disbursed by the Bank has been properly prepared and is
presented as an annex to the PFS. This reconciliation statement should indicate the mechanism of
disbursement, i.e, Special Account, Statement of Expenditures, or direct payments.

(f)    The program accounts have been prepared in accordance with consistently applied International
Accounting Standards and give a true and fair view of the financial situation of the program as of
June 30, December 31, 1999, 2000, 2001 and of resources and expenditures for the semi-annual
years ended on those dates.
Program Financial Statements
The Program Financial Statements should include:
(a)    a Statement of Source (summary of funds received, showing the World Bank, ADB other donors
funds, Government Counterpart funds, and beneficiary contribution separately) and Application
of Funds (summary of Expenditures shown under the main program headings and by main
categories of expenditures for the current year);
(b)    a Balance Sheet showing Accumulated Funds of the Program, bank balances, fixed assets,
inventories, other assets of the program, and liabilities, if any; and
(c)    notes to the financial statements presenting background information on the program, the
accounting principles, details analysis and relevant explanation of the main accounts/major
balances, etc.
Statements of Expenditures
In addition to the audit of the PFS, the auditor is required to audit all SOEs used during the year under
review as the basis for the submission of withdrawal applications. The auditor should apply such tests and
controls as the auditor considers necessary under the circumstances, ensuring that the existing internal
control procedures for the preparation and processing of the said SOEs are sound and reliable. The
auditor should examine carefully the expenditures to ensure that: i) they are genuine program
expenditures and eligible with regard to the relevant financing agreement and with reference to the
program documents of the donors for guidance when considered necessary; and ii) they are reasonable
with respect to the planned activities included in the annual work program and budget. Where ineligible
expenditures are identified as having been included in withdrawal applications and reimbursed against,
there should be a schedule listing individual SOE withdrawal applications for specific reference number
and amount. The total withdrawals under the SOE procedure should agree with the overall reconciliation
of bank disbursements prepared by the program and described above. A separate opinion to that effect
will be issued by the auditor as indicated in the introductory paragraph.
Special Accounts
In conjunction with the audit of the Program Financial Statement, the auditor is also required to prepare a
Special Account reconciliation and audit the activities on the Special Accounts associated with the
Program. The Special Account usually comprise but is not limited to:



Technical Annex                                     Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation
Sierra Leone                                                      Attachment 8: Page 3 of 4
* deposit and replenishments received from the donors
* payment substantiated by withdrawal applications
* interest that may be earned from the balances and which belong to the borrower; and
* the remaining balances at the end of the fiscal year.
The auditor must form a separate opinion as to the degree of compliance with the Bank's procedures and
the balance of the Special Account at the year-end. The audit should examine the eligibility and
correctness and financial transactions during the period under review and fund balances at the end of such
a period, the operation and use of the SA in accordance with the financing agreement, and the adequacy
of internal controls for this type of disbursement mechanism.
For the program, the Special Accounts are referred to in legal agreements between the donors and the
Government of Sierra Leone. Special Accounts statements and the auditor's separate opinion thereon
should accompany the Program Financial Statements.
Internal Control System
The auditor is required to perform an in-depth and comprehensive review of the program internal control
system. Such a review would be larger in scope than what is normally required for ordinary audits. The
objective of the review is to provide the auditor with sufficient understanding of the rules and procedures
of the internal control system, including the existing administrative, accounting, financial, and budgetary
Manual of procedures, and to determine whether the said rules and procedures are adequate, reliable, and
operating correctly. In this vein, the auditor should assess with particular attention and determine
whether: i) the computerized financial accounting, and reporting system in place is appropriate; ii) the
accounting and financial staff within the FMPU is capable of managing the program efficiently using the
computerized system. The findings and observations of the auditor should be presented in a separate
report, the Management Letter, addressed along with the audit report to the borrower's representative.
The Management Letter should highlight all the weaknesses in the program internal control system,
assess the inherent risks associated with the internal control shortcomings, and make practical and
relevant recommendations to improve the system as well as to enhance the managerial skills and
capability of the accounting and financial staff. In the Management Letter, the auditor will, inter-alia:
(a)    give comments and observations on the accounting records, systems and controls that were
examined during the course of the audit;
(b)   identify specific deficiencies and areas of weakness in systems and controls and make
recommendation for their improvement;
(c)   report on the degree of compliance of each of the financial covenants on the financing agreement
and give comments, if any, on internal and external matters affecting such compliance;
(d)    communicate matter that have come to attention during the audit which might have a significant
impact on the implementation of the project;
(e)    bring to the borrower's attention any other matters that auditors considers pertinent.

Interim Audit
The auditor is required to carry out an interim audit (after 9 months of activities) for each year.
He should perform during the interim audit: i) a comprehensive review of the internal control system,
ii) an assessment of the proper recording/accounting of the transactions, and iii) an in-depth review of the
Statement of Expenditures up to that date (the review of the remaining months should be carried out
during annual audits). The auditor should prepare an interim audit report as a result of his audit to be
discussed with the Program Coordinator before distribution by the latter to the donors.
Audit Report
The auditor is required to prepare and produce for each annual audit:
a)    the audit report/short forrn report containing: i) the auditor professional opinion on the Project
Financial Statements, the actual audited financial statements, and the notes to the audited
Financial Statements; ii) a separate opinion on the SOEs along with a schedule of SOEs used
during the fiscal year (sequence number, date, description, and amount) and commenting on the
accuracy and propriety of expenditures withdrawn under SOEs procedures and the extend to
which the Bank can rely on SOEs as a basis for credit disbursement; and iii) a separate opinion
on the Special Accounts commenting on the degree of compliance with the Bank's procedures
and the eligibility and correctness of the financial transactions through the Special Account
during the year, and
b)    the Management Letter reporting on the major internal control weakness as well as managerial
deficiencies and making relevant and practical recommendations for improvement.
The auditor should submit the audit report (short form) and the Management Letter to the borrower's
designated representative within six (6) months of the end of the fiscal year. The latter should transmit
copies to the Ministry of Finance and promptly forward three (3) copies to each donor.
General
The auditor should be given access to and he should consult all legal documents (Loan/Grant
Agreements), Appraisal Reports, supervision reports, correspondences, and any other information
associated with the project and deemed necessary by the auditor.
It is highly desirable that the auditor become familiar with the donors' guidelines on financial reporting
and auditing of projects which summarize their financial reporting and auditing requirements. The auditor
should also be familiar with the donors' disbursement manuals. Those documents will be provided by the
Financial Manager of the FMPU.

Consultancy to Design the Monitoring and Evaluation System
for the Government of Sierra Leone
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE
The signing of the Lome Peace Agreement in July 1999 brought a spirit of hope to the
people of Sierra Leone. Government and the people now look forward to moving the
country from a period of emergency to one of reconstruction and resettlement. The
implementation of the long-delayed socio-economic recovery programme should assist
with the consolidation of the peace and laying the foundations for sustained economic
growth. To this end, the Commission eagerly looks forward to kick starting the NRRRP
which was abrogated by political instability which has was predicated by civil conflict.
Given the fact Government is in partnership with other stakeholders and implementing
partners, it is a necessary condition that a robust but effective and flexible monitoring
and evaluation system is set up that would be economy-wide, but embraces the various
compartments or sub-programmes/projects of the other stakeholders and implementing
partners. This system would harmonise all the other sub-systems and generate a
common data- base from which the entire spectrum of assistance to the country's
recovery programme can be evaluated
The NCRRR and its partner agencies recognise the need for an effective and holistic
monitoring and evaluation system that will provide accurate and timely information on
the entire economic and social recovery programmes and sub-projects that are being
implemented countrywide. This should enable the making of appropriate and timely
management decisions. It is in this context that this consultancy is required
OBJECTIVE
Working with the Director of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation as the National
Counterpart, the consultant will assist the Commission to develop a comprehensive M &
E system for the NRRP which will take into account all the sub-programmes being
implemented by the various partners of the Government in the socio-economic recovery
process.
The system to be developed should provide senior management with an effective tool
to:
* Provide a bird's eye view of the entire NRRP at a glance;
* Assess the administrative performance of the central and regional levels of the
NCRRR;

* Provide information on the progress and constraints affecting the implementation of
programmes and sub-projects in order to be able to take appropriate and timely
action;
* Provide on a regular basis and on special requests a concise status and analysis of
RRR activities;
* Analyse the impact of programme activities as implemented by RRR partner
organisations in terms of their contribution to rehabilitation, reconstruction and
poverty reduction.
Specifically, the consultant will:
* Analyse all the donor-supported RRR programmes and projects (CRRP,
CRRP/ADB, EAP, PDP, and any other) with a specific focus on extracting from
these specific objectives for the programme's components, activities, inputs and
outputs related to these;
* Based on the programme and individual project components, develop the framework
and quantitative indicators for the overall programme performance as regards to:
i)   overall funding of programme
ii)  institutional capacity of NCRRR to manage programmes;
iii)  individual project inputs, outputs and outcomes
iv)   service delivery performance including a measure for effectiveness of the ERSF
and other sub-project review, approval and disbursements of funds
v)   ensuring an equitable balance in approved sub-projects in terms of geographical
distribution, priority sectors and especially vulnerable groups such as women
and ex-combatants
t Examine existing and proposed reporting procedures and formats and recommend,
when relevant, revisions and additions necessary for the satisfactory performance of
the M&E system.
* Develop a strategy for the computerisation of M&E information taking into account
the existing conditions and human resource capacity;
* Based on the computerisation strategy, develop an implementation plan for setting
up a computerized database using standard software (Microsoft Windows 98
compatible).
* Determine related staff requirements in terms of number and minimum skill
requirements.
* Design a suitable database structure for monitoring of RRR activities, including
standard auto-generated overview reports.
* Recommend on computers, software and peripherals required for the operations of
the M&E Unit of the NCRRR.
* Prepare detailed Terms of Reference for a national System Analyst/Programmer to
develop the database application and supervise the System Analyst/Programmer in
developing NCRRR M&E Database(s).
* Liaise with the M&E Unit and the System Analyst/programmer of NCDDR and other

OVERVIEW OF THE EMERGENCY RECOVERY SUPPORT FUND
(REVISED AUGUST 1998)
1. Overview
The Emergency Recovery Support Fund (ERSF) is a Government of Sierra Leone initiative co-ordinated
by the National Commission for Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation (NCRRR) to help
address the negative social and economic affects of more than seven years of civil war and ten months of
junta rule. The Commission has been charged with the responsibility of helping rebuild the country and
will do so in collaboration with key donor and implementing partner organizations. Several donor
organizations, including the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and the UNDP, will support the
efforts of the Commission to address the urgent needs of resettling displaced people and refugees,
restoring basic social services and infrastructure in the war affected areas, reintegrating ex-combatants,
and addressing the needs of peace building and reconciliation. The ERSF will also support a labor-
intensive public works program designed to assist the poorest members of society in the principal urban
centers.
The ERSF will finance community-based projects, which address the priority needs of internally
displaced persons, refugees, former combatants, and vulnerable groups in urban centers. The Fund will
be used to address multi-sectoral needs; starting with more urgent food production and temporary shelter,
and running through medium and longer term concerns for basic infrastructure repair and rehabilitation of
productive assets. These projects will be implemented by eligible partners who include international and
national NGOs, government line ministries, existing donor project units, and qualified community-based
organizations.
The Commission and the ERSF can only begin to support the long process of rebuilding the country;
other funding and implementation strategies will be necessary to address the overall needs for
reconstruction and rehabilitation. As the country moves from an emergency recovery phase to a longer-
term developmental one, more strategic sectoral investment programs implemented through the
respective line ministries and implementing partners will be required.  As well as sharing this
responsibility for helping rebuild the country with line ministries and implementing partners, the ERSF
must also serve to catalyze the self-help efforts of each village. In the end, the local population must take
the initiative and responsibility for rebuilding the individual lives, community infrastructure, and social
ties negatively affected by the war and unrest.
The Fund will rely on a decentralized bottom-up project planning, approval and monitoring process,
which taps into and builds upon existing systems and structures at the regional and local levels. NGOs,
line ministries and other entities will be called upon to design sub-projects in close collaboration with
village, section and chiefdom authorities. Regional NCRRR staff will have primary responsibility for
day-to-day management of the project review process. Regional committees will be formed and
composed of two NCRRR staff members, a Ministry of Finance, Development and Economic Planning
representative, the regional HACU field officer, and one representative of the implementing partners to
be selected by the Inter-agency Forum. These regional Projects Committees will have the responsibility
and authority to approve projects up to a maximum given level. NCRRR headquarters' staff will provide
the broad policy and program-planning framework for the ERSF, monitor its implementation and co-
ordinate the overall process.

The ERSF has been designed through a process of consultation, investigation, and consensus building
initiated by the then Ministry of National Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and Resettlement, and others, in
mid-1996. Over a ten-month period immediately preceding the coup, MNRRR staff, central and regional
government authorities, national and international NGOs, and key international agencies and donors
involved in the rehabilitation and recovery process were consulted on how best such a funding
mechanism should work. This collaborative process culminated in two stakeholder workshops to
elaborate and finalize these procedures with Ministry staff, NGO representatives, HACU and the World
Bank held in November 1996 and May 1997. The workshop participants identified nine principles,
which should underpin both the design and implementation of the ERSF. These are:
1. the ERSF and the National Resettlement, Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Program (NRRRP) is
operating in a dynamic and changing environment-- therefore, the Fund's operation systems must be
flexible and open to revision as the situation on the ground and in the provinces also changes,
2. given the fluid nature of the program environment, phasing of different aspects of the Fund, and its
administrative systems, must be considered,
3. the Fund's administration should be decentralized and have a regional focus,
4. the Fund should tie into existing systems and structures; be coordinated and integrated at provincial
levels,
5. the project review and monitoring process must be open and transparent,
6. the systems must operate quickly without sacrificing accountability,
7. the Fund should support productive activities,
8. the Fund should emphasize community and stakeholder participation, and
9. the administrative procedures should not adversely affect the existing relationships among NGOs, or
between NGOs and the communities with which they work.
The consultative process used to arrive at these procedures created a shared vision of how the ERSF
should work, and a shared responsibility for its successful implementation among the Commission and its
implementing partners. This spirit of partnership and collaboration should be maintained as the Fund
begins operating. If the systems and procedures do not function as envisioned then it should be seen as
the joint responsibility of all parties to ensure that a new system be put in place that works. Furthermore,
subsequent reviews and revisions of these systems should draw upon these same collaborative
mechanisms and co-operation to devise ways of better implementing the program as experience is gained.
Specifically, NCRRR will conduct a detailed review of the ERSF procedures and projects six months
after the fund is fully operational (expected to be October, 1998) in order to test the effectiveness of the
procedures proposed herein. The review will look at, inter alia, the effectiveness of the project review
process, the membership of the approval committees, the level of project approval authority at regional
level, and community representation in the overall process.
This document serves as both an overview of the ERSF for donors and other interested parties, and as
guidelines to potential implementing partners for the preparation of project proposals for consideration by
the NCRRR. The document is divided into four subsequent sections that deal with the overall objectives
of the ERSF, evaluation criteria and the project selection process, administration of funds, and procedures
for project monitoring. A more detailed Operational Manual has also been prepared for use by NCRRR
staff in overseeing the implementation of the ERSF.

2. Objectives and Principles of the ERSF
The objectives of the ERSF are:
*  To assist communities and vulnerable social groups in re-establishing their livelihood and
production systems;
*  To help rehabilitate community level infrastructure (roads, schools, clinics, water systems, court
barries, rural markets, irrigation systems) damaged during the conflict and in the poorest sections
of Freetown and other urban centres, in accordance with needs and priorities as expressed by
communities themselves;
*  To support the re-establishment of basic service provision in the fields of health, education,
agriculture, etc. in areas affected by the conflict;
*  To provide support to local-level initiatives aimed at reconciliation and rebuilding social
structures damaged during the years of the conflict; and
*  To strengthen the capacity of local organisations to provide effective support to longer-term
processes of reconstruction and development.
Projects qualifying for support under the ERSF should be developed and implemented in accordance with
the following principles:
1. Enhance the opportunities for self-reliance of displaced and affected communities;
2. Strengthen local capacity to implement and manage reconstruction and development activities;
3. Promote awareness and sensitivity for gender equity and the protection of the specially
disadvantaged (e.g., children, widows and the disabled) in the decision-making process;
4. Maximize grassroots participation and input in the project cycle;
5. Promote an integrated approach to resettlement and rehabilitation; and
6. Build the objectives of maintaining peace, reconciliation andforgiveness into the resettlement
process.
3. Basic Eligibility Criteria
To be eligible for funding under the ERSF, implementing organizations and the project must meet certain
basic criteria. These criteria are sub-divided between institutional, sectoral, geographic, target group and
financial, as discussed below.
3.1 Criteria for Implementing Partners
For an organization to be eligible for funding under the ERSF it must meet the following organizational
criteria:
* be a legal entity registered in Sierra Leone and able to enter into a legally binding contract;
* have a minimum of 2 years working experience (within or outside Sierra Leone)
implementing the same or similar activities as those proposed to the ERSF;
* have adequate infrastructure and personnel currently based in the region of proposed activity
to carry out the project;



Technical Annex                                       Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation
Sierra Leone                                                       Attachment II: Page 4 of 13
*   have adequate administrative and financial management systems and procedures in place to
safe guard the use of ERSF resources; and
*   have no legal dispute or debts which would materially affect the institution's ability to
undertake the project.
3.2 Project Types
In line with the overall objectives of the National Resettlement, Reconstruction and Rehabilitation
Program, the ERSF will support only those projects that address the following broad sectors and areas of
activity:
*  Agricultural Rehabilitation: including support to basic productive activities primarily
through the provision of seeds, tools and emergency food supply (using existing food
pipelines) for the farming season; support to rehabilitation of tree crops, other cash crops,
fishing (through the provision of equipment) and animal husbandry (through re-stocking of
animals and provision of veterinary drugs);
*   Shelter: principally to provide temporary shelter and provide the planning framework for
permanent facilities;
* Rehabilitation of Community Infrastructure: to support the rehabilitation of schools, health
centres, court barries, water supply, roads, rural market-places and other priorities as
identified by communities;
*   Re-establishment of Essential Services: to provide human and material resources essential to
the re-establishment of basic health and education services in collaboration with the relevant
ministries;
*   Reintegration of Vulnerable Groups: supporting the reintegration of specific groups (e.g.,
widows, female head of households, ex-combatants, children affected by the war and
disabled people) into communities; which may include temporary safety nets, vocational
training, capital/credit, counselling/trauma healing, information, employment (e.g. labour-
intensive public works), education and/or functional literacy;
*   Promotion of Reconciliation: for programs promoting reconciliation and conflict resolution
at the community level; which may include developing conflict resolution skills, promoting
reconciliation through local media, supporting youth, community and voluntary associations
with the potential for promoting reconciliation;
*   Jobs Creation through Public Works: to establish a temporary social safety net mechanism
targeting vulnerable groups of unemployed and ex-combatants living and working in urban
((Freetown and provincial capitals) and rural areas; labour-intensive works will be supported
in environmental sanitation and waste disposal, road repair and maintenance, public building
maintenance, reforestation, etc.
*   Small Enterprise Promotion and Vocational Training Schemes: designed to support
development of productive skills among individual target group members and generating
income and employment at community level; and
*   Capacity-Building: of local organisations in all of the above areas the development.
3.3 Geographic Focus
The ERSF will be active throughout the regions and districts of Sierra Leone that has been affected by the
war. Priority will be given to supporting populations returning to rural areas and for those areas most
severely affected by the war. The Fund will also support labor-intensive public works activities that
target the most vulnerable groups of unemployed in the urban and rural areas.



Technical Annex                                     Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation
Sierra Leone                                                    Attachment 11: Page 5 of 13
The ERSF will co-ordinate with other donor recovery activities (e.g., EU Resettlement and Rehabilitation
Program, line ministry emergency plans, NGO initiatives, etc.) so as to avoid duplication and overlap in
their areas of operation. The procedures and mechanisms for project review and approval will also
support the funding mechanism of the Government's Social Action and Poverty Alleviation (SAPA)
Program, which is located within NCRRR.
3.4 Target Groups
To be eligible for consideration, any project proposal presented to the ERSE must target the following
beneficiary groups:
* internally displaced persons and refugees who left their homes and communities due to the
war and/or subsequent civil strife that resulted from junta rule and its aftermath;
*   people in war-affected villages who never moved but are taking initiatives to re-establish
themselves and their communities as well as people returning spontaneously to their villages
from displaced camps, bush camps and other areas;
*   vulnerable groups, such as female headed households; children affected by the conflict
through war trauma, being orphaned, or disrupted schooling; and disabled people, including
those severely injured or traumatised by the war;
e ex-combatants and their dependants; and
* urban unemployed living in the poorest areas of Freetown, Makeni, Bo, and Kenema.
3.5 Financial Restrictions
The following budget restrictions and financial guidelines will govern ERSF projects:
*  no project budget and supported activities should exceed 12 months duration, nor go beyond
the 3-year mandate of the Commission;
*   a maximum funding limit of approximately Le.850,000,000 (US$500,000) per project will
apply;
*   at any given time, the ERSF will not provide funding to an organisation in excess of 50% of
the organisation's previous year's annual budget;
*   only allowable cost categories (as defined in the proposal development guidelines) will be
considered for financing under the ERSF;
*  no counter-part funds are required of implementing partners; however, community in-kind
contributions will be encouraged for community infrastructure projects (clinics, schools,
etc.);
* up to a maximum of 20% of the total ERSF proposed project budget will be allowed for
"organisational" costs including administrative costs, overheads, general equipment which
would not directly benefit the community, etc.; and
* purchase of large assets such as institutional infrastructure, vehicles, etc. will be
discouraged, and the disposition of any vehicles upon project completion will be the subject
of negotiation between NCRRR and the implementing partner.
4. Technical Evaluation Criteria
Once a project and organization are shown to meet the basic eligibility criteria listed above, projects
submitted to the ERSF will be reviewed and evaluated based on two sets of technical criteria, general and
specific.



Technical Annex                                           Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation
Sierra Leone                                                            Attachment 11: Page 6 of l3
4.1 General Criteria
General criteria will be applied to each project proposal by the ERSF secretariat staff (see sections 5.1
and 5.2) in assessing overall project design and fundability. This assessment would look at institutional,
financial, social and environmental criteria, project coherence, and sustainability. These categories of
criteria are described in more detail below.
Institutional criteria; including number and types of personnel, available infrastructure and physical
resources to carry out project, financial management and administrative systems, years and types of
experience, project value relative to overall organizational finances, etc.
Project coherence; including relation between identified problems, causes and proposed solutions, the
clarity and specificity of project objectives and links to proposed project activities, feasibility of
achieving the proposed end results, completeness and reasonability of the monitoring plan, and the
innovativeness or creativity of the project design.
Financial criteria; including a clear relation between project activities and budget items,
reasonableness of proposed inputs and unit costs, inputs conform with standard specifications and
applicable market rates, budget form and substance in agreement with guidelines (no unacceptable
expenditure categories, adequate information, etc.), and the relative level of "direct" and "indirect"
costs.
Sustainability criteria; including level and substance of community participation in project planning
and implementation, level of local knowledge or skills required for implementation, level of local
labor and/or materials in project, level of operation or maintenance costs once project is complete,
viability of maintenance plan, impact on disposable time of women, income generating potential of
project, and effect project has on environment and natural resources.
Social criteria; including understanding of ethnic characteristics of community and region, impact on
vulnerable groups, and potential conflicts or obstacles between different groups or institutions within
community.
Environmental criteria; including identification and mitigation of potential environmental impacts of
the proposed projects, in particular issues related to health and sanitation, natural resource
exploitation and pesticide use.
This review will be carried out by ERSF/NCRRR staff in the offices and at the proposed sites of the
implementing partners. Clearly, the larger, more complex and more costly the project, the more detailed
and thorough the general technical review will be. In particular, the regional and district level staff of
NCRRR should assess the extent to which the project reflects the priorities of the community in which the
project will be implemented.
4.2 Specific Technical Criteria
Suitable line ministries and technical sub-committees (as appropriate) in each region will conduct specific
technical evaluations of each proposal. It will be the responsibility of these groups to apply appropriate
technical criteria to the project review; such criteria will vary depending on the project type (i.e.,
agriculture, infrastructure, basic services, or enterprise development). In general, however, these sub-
committees or task forces would look at the following areas in making a technical assessment of the
project:



Technical Annex                                       Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation
Sierra Leone                                                       Attachment 11: Page 7 of 13
*   demonstrated understanding of the factors and technical conditions influencing the project
and beneficiary groups;
*   conformity with standard technical specifications, norms or practices for the particular sector
under consideration (such as road specifications, standard building designs, or health
treatment protocols);
*   technical soundness and adequacy of the proposed solutions (i.e., will the problem be
resolved with the level and extent of input and assistance proposed), and if the project
objectives are realistic and achievable;
*   technical skills, knowledge and capacity of implementing agency/staff; and
*   use of proven and appropriate technical practices or methods.
5. ERSF Structures and Procedures
Administration of the ERSF is distinguished by two important features; a decentralized management
structure, and a shared responsibility between NCRRR and its implementing partners (NGOs, line
ministries, etc.) in both the administration and implementation of the Fund.
The NCRRR has final responsibility for the ERSF and reports to its funding agencies on overall resource
use and achievements under the Fund. Implementing partners contracted by NCRRR and working at the
local level will carry out day-to-day implementation of project activities. These partners report directly to
district and regional offtces of NCRRR, which will monitor the Fund. An inter-agency ERSF Projects
Committee will be established in each provincial capital to review, approve, or recommend all ERSF
projects proposed for that region. A central level ERSF Projects Committee will also be set up to review
all projects exceeding the regional project approval threshold of US$50,000.  The central level
Committee will also take responsibility for approving and monitoring all Western Area project proposals.
District Supervisors and Community Development Officers will serve as outreach staff for the
Commission at the district level. These staff will be responsible for co-ordination and information
exchange with district-level government representatives (especially line ministries); facilitating NCRRR
linkages with village leaders, section heads and paramount chiefs; encouraging the participation of local
groups and communities in the ERSF; and monitoring the work of implementing partners.
The central-level Commission will have responsibility for overall financial management of the ERSF,
monitoring and evaluation of ERSF and NRRRP implementation, setting and revising ERSF policy, and
co-ordination of implementing partners at the national level.
5.1 Relevant ERSF Structures
There are six structures, four at regional levels and two at the center, which will share the responsibility
for the successful implementation of the Fund. These structures are (i) the regional ERSF Projects
Committee, (ii) the ERSF technical secretariat within the Regional NCRRR office, (iii) the regional Inter-
agency Forum, (iv) the technical committees or task forces operating in each region, (v) the National
ERSF Projects Committee, and (vi) the Financial Management and Procurement Unit. Each body and its
overall responsibilities are described below.
The ERSF Projects Committee will be established and given the responsibility for reviewing and
approving projects up to the threshold level of $US 50,000, equivalent.1 This Committee will be
During the pilot phase of the ERSF (the first six-months of operation), all projects above US$25,000 equivalent will also
require the approval of the National ERSF Projects Committee in Freetown.

composed of 2 NCRRR staff (the Regional Co-ordinator and one other staff member2) the HACU
regional officer, the regional MOFDEP representative, and one representative of the implementing
partners who will be nominated by the Inter-agency Forum.3 The Regional Co-ordinator will chair the
Committee.4
The ERSF technical secretariat, consisting of two projects officers and one finance officer, will be set up
in each region and will be responsible for the day-to-day administrative tasks associated with ERSF
project applications, reviews, and approvals. While the secretariat is responsible to. the Projects
Committee, on a day-to-day basis these staff will report to the NCRRR Regional Co-ordinator.
The Regional Inter-agency Forum will provide broad-based, multi-sectoral and inter-agency feedback to
the project approval and monitoring process. This body is chaired by the NCRRR Regional Co-ordinator
and serves as the forum for general information exchange and identification of potential problems or
conflicts in ERSF project design and implementation. All proposed projects will be presented to this
body before detailed review by NCRRR staff and the appropriate technical body so as to draw upon the
collective knowledge of the broader development community in the regions. Membership in this forum is
open to all interested parties and potential implementing partners throughout the region.
Technical Sub-committees. As neither the ERSF Projects Committee nor the technical secretariat will
have all the information or technical know-how to assess all types of proposals, existing, or newly
formed, technical sub-committees or task-forces5 will be called upon to review specific technical aspects
of project proposals. The NCRRR Regional Co-ordinator will seek the cooperation of the relevant
technical committees or ad hoc groups through the appropriate line ministry or public authority (such as
SLRA), and will have access to necessary resources to facilitate individual and committee members input
to this process.
A National ERSF Projects Committee will be formed at central level to: (i) make recommendations on all
sub-project approvals for contracts which exceed the regional approval threshold of US$50,000, (ii)
review and approve all urban public works projects that target the unemployed of Greater Freetown, and
(iii) review and approve all project proposals that are national in scope such as those presented by central
level line ministries. The National Committee will be chaired by the NCRRR Director for RRR, and will
include the Director for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation; the Director of the SAPA Program; a
representative for the Development Department of MOFDEP; a representative of UN/OCHA, and one
representative of the donors that support the ERSF.
The Financial Management and Procurement Unit (FMPU) will be established to assist NCRRR with all
aspects of contracting, disbursements, financial management and reporting in relation to the ERSF, as
well as other donor financed activities within the Commission. Once an ERSF project is approved and
contracts are signed by the Commission, the FMPU will manage all direct payments made to
implementing partners and will ensure that financial reporting and record keeping is in line with GOSL
and donor requirements, and internationally accepted accounting standards. The table below indicates the
main characteristics and responsibilities of these ERSF structures.
2 During the pilot phase, the second NCRRR person will be a headquarters staff to ensure proper implementation of ERSF
procedures and to help build the capacity of the regional committees and review process.
3 The IAF will nominate I representative and I alternate so as to avoid any conflict of interest in the event that a proposal is
submitted by the IAF representative's implementing organization.
4 The feasibility of including a beneficiary representative on the Projects Committee will be considered as part of the six-month
review of the ERSF pilot phase.
5 Such as the Regional Technical Committee on Food Aid, Regional Agriculture Committee, or Regional Health and Nutrition
Committee.

5.2 Project Review & Approval Procedures
Project Development. Potential implementing partners should first contact NCRRR to receive appropriate
guidance in preparing a proposal. For this purpose, NCRRR has developed guidelines and standard
formats to assist implementing partners in the proposal development process. While information will be
available at all NCRRR central, regional, and district offices, partners are encouraged to contact the
appropriate regional or district levels office nearest the point where project will be implemented.
Potential implementing partners will present their project idea, or concept, to the Inter-agency Forum for
review and comment prior to submission of a full proposal. This review is designed to ensure better co-
ordination of development activities in the region, and to identify any potential problems or concerns in
the design of the project. The implementing partner will be encouraged to present the project concept to
the IAF directly, however, if an organization cannot be present at the IAF meeting, NCRRR staff (either

Sierra Leone                                                     Attachment 11: Page 10 of 13
district or regional) can present the project concept on behalf of the implementing partner. NCRRR will
develop a standard form that implementing partners can use to prepare and submit this brief project
summary to the ERSF project officer at the regional NCRRR office. The project officer would then
determine when the summary would be presented to the IAF based on the volume and backlog of
proposals, and the other duties of the IAF.
A project concept must be reviewed by the L4F before it can be consideredfor funding by NCRRR
Once the IAF has reviewed and commented upon a project idea, an implementing partner can present a
full project proposal to NCRRR taking into consideration any comments or concerns raised by the 1AF.
Project proposals should be submitted directly to the NCRRR regional office, however, district and
chiefdom based organizations might submit proposals to NCRRR through the district offices if more
convenient. District staff will have no direct responsibility for reviewing proposals, however, and will
transmit all proposals (and project concepts) directly to the regional office.
An NGO or CBO mustfill out an "NGO Profile"form and submit it to NCRRR before it is eligiblefor
funding under the ERSF.
Proposal Review. Project proposal review will be the main responsibility of the ERSF secretariat staff
(the Projects and Finance officers at the regional NCRRR office). These staff will first ensure that a
project and the applicant organization meet basic eligibility criteria as indicated in section 3 above. At
this same time, the ERSF secretariat staff will verify that any comments or concerns raised by the IAF
have been taken into consideration in the project proposal. If a project or organization is found to be
ineligible based on the basic criteria of the ERSF, or if the issues raised by the IAF have not been
addressed or clarified, the proposal will be returned to the proposing organization with a letter explaining
why the project could not be considered for funding.
Once found to be eligible, the Projects and Finance Officer of the regional NCRRR offices will carry out
a general technical review of projects and organizations using the criteria discussed in section 4.1 above.
This review will assess the institutional capacity to carry out the project, the project design, financial
aspects of the project, project sustainability, and the environmental impact of the project. NCRRR has
developed detailed forms that will be used in the application of these criteria to make the review of
project concepts and organizations efficient and objective.
Technical working groups (sub-committee, task force, or ad hoc body) will also conduct a specific
technical assessment of a proposed project. This will be done to ensure that proposals meet standard
technical specifications or norms for the particular sector in which the project is proposed.
The ERSF secretariat will send the proposal to the appropriate government line Ministry or technical
authority to co-ordinate and take responsibility for specific technical reviews of ERSF proposals.
As a part of the overall review process, ERSF secretariat and technical working group members should
visit both the implementing agency's office and the proposed project site to assess and apply the various
review criteria.
The ERSF secretariat will have a maximum of 15 working days from the time a proposal is submitted to
carry out the basic and general technical review of projects. A technical sub-committee will be required
to review and respond to the specific technical issues of a project proposal within 5 days of receipt of the
proposal (or specific technical questions) from NCRRR. The sub-committee will review project
proposals to determine their technical viability, propose modifications (if any) and indicate their
recommendation of the project on technical grounds. Member or members of the sub-committee will be
able to visit the site of a project or the offices of an applicant agency in reviewing the proposal. The

Environmental Protection Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Environment (MAFE)
will assist NCRRR with any sub-projects for which environmental concerns require further review and
analysis. NCRRR regional offices will make appropriate resources (e.g. supplies, logistics, trek
allowances, etc.) available to the technical sub-committee members to ensure adequate and timely action
(including MAFE environmental assessments).
Project Approval. Recommendations from both the ERSF secretariat and respective sub-committee will
be consolidated by the Project Officers and passed on to the ERSF Projects Committee. This Committee
will meet fortnightly to review the technical recommendations and decide to either approve or reject a
project proposal, up to a threshold of US$50,000, equivalent. For projects above this threshold, the
regional ERSF Projects Committee may either reject the project orrecommend a proposal to the central
level for approval. Therefore, a National ERSF Projects Committee will be formed and be given the
authority to approve projects over US$50,000. This committee will be composed of the NCRRR Director
of RRR (chair); the Director of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation; the Director of the SAPA Program;
one representative from the Development Department of MOFDEP; and one representative from
UN/OCHA.
NCRRR will be managing different sources of funding from different donor agencies. Nonetheless, it is
hoped that the procedures presented here can be applied to the greatest extent possible to all outside
funding. However, early in the approval process, the Commission will determine which funding
mechanism at its disposal would be the most appropriate for a given project. By so doing, NCRRR can
then take appropriate internal administrative action to seek any special approvals for different
programmes (such as SAPA) or funding agencies to reduce the need for different external procedures or
requirements of potential implementing partners.
5.3 Implementation Arrangements
Contracting. Once a project has been approved, the ERSF Projects Officer in each region will prepare
the contract for signature based on a standard contract format and required attachments. The contract will
include a summary description of the project, a detailed implementation plan, project budget and
disbursement schedule, and customized forms for physical and financial progress reporting. Either the
Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner of NCRRR will sign all contracts.
Disbursements and Financial Control. The Financial Management and Procurement Unit (FMPU) of
the NCRRR will disburse funds to the implementing partners for project activities once the Commission
has authorized the contract. All disbursements will be made based on monthly financial reports, adequate
documentation of claimed expenditures, and periodic requests for payment submitted by implementing
partners to the regional ERSF Finance Officers. Implementing partners will submit monthly reports and
associated documentation to the Finance Officers no latter than 10 days after the close of the preceding
month. These reports and requests for payment will be reviewed and consolidated at regional level and
sent to the FMPU for final review and payment processing. The same consolidated report is sent to the
ERSF Projects Committee for monitoring purposes. In the event of any questions or concerns raised by
the regional Finance Officers, the Projects Committee, and/or the FMPU, NCRRR staffs will follow-up
directly with the implementing partners.
All financial reporting and disbursement requests will be carried out per the terms of contract between the
Commission and the implementing partners, and all forms for such transactions will be provided to the
implementing partners as attachments to the standard contract. Unless issues or questions arise regarding
reported expenditures and the status of outstanding balances, payments will be made to implementing
partners within 20 days of financial report submission and request for payment.

NCRRR will require that all projects valued at more than $50,000, equivalent, be audited by an
independent public accounting firm. The audit should include a review of the contractual obligations and
restrictions for the ERSF project. If an implementing partner already conducts annual external audits of
its project activities, then this audit will be adequate for NCRRR and ERSF purposes, provided that it also
reviews the contractual obligations of the implementing partner. The incremental costs for such audit will
be an allowable expense under the ERSF project activity. If a project is valued at less than $50,000,
equivalent, and if the implementing partner does not have an independent audit of their accounts
conducted annually, NCRRR will require that all original vouchers for all expenses claimed under ERSF
be submitted to NCRRR as part of the monthly financial report. Otherwise, copies of invoices and
vouchers should be presented with the financial reports.
To further guarantee adequate financial control, the Internal Control Unit of the FMPU will be authorized
to carry out spot checks of ERSF project expenditures reported by implementing partners. Finally, the
semi-annual audits of the overall NCRRR operations will also include a random testing of ERSF project
activities and expenditures.
Monitoring and Reporting. Implementing partners will be required to submit monthly technical reports
to NCRRR that quantify project outputs and quarterly narrative progress reports providing details of
project progress and constraints. Two copies of each report will be submitted to NCRRR; one will go to
the District Supervisor where the project activities are being implemented, and one will go to the
Regional Co-ordinator for the appropriate region. As with the financial reports, these technical progress
reports will be submitted to NCRRR within 10 days of the close of the reporting period. Customized
formats for reporting technical progress will be designed and made available to implementing partners as
attachments to the standard ERSF project contract.

District Supervisors will receive the reports and be responsible for verifying the information presented
through regular communications with the implementing partners and field visits to the project sites. The
project officers at regional level will review and consolidate the progress reports for all active projects in
the region. The regional office will have responsibility for entering physical progress data into a
computerized monitoring system. A consolidated report on all regional projects will be prepared by the
project officer and presented to the Projects Committee for review and discussion. A copy of the same
report will be sent to the relevant line ministries in the region. The consolidated report and the electronic
data will also be sent to the Directorate of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation at the central-level
Commission for further consolidation and analysis. The M&E unit at the central Commission will
prepare a quarterly progress report on the overall implementation of the ERSF.
5.4 Public Sector Institutions
The relevant technical departments, regional, and district offices of the line ministries of the GOSL have
an important role to fulfil in the implementation of the ERSF. First, relevant line ministries (i.e., health,
education, agriculture, works, etc.) are all potential implementing partners to the ERSF. The Commission
fully expects that the appropriate technical units and offices of these ministries will be active participants
in the development and implementation of projects. NCRRR expects to have certain core support
resources available to assist regional and district ministry offices fully participate in the ERSF. Secondly,
the technical ministries will play a critical role at the regional level in providing guidance and input to the
ERSF project staff and Projects Committee.  NCRRR  recognizes the technical expertise and
responsibility that the line ministries have in guaranteeing adherence to sectoral standards and norms.
Therefore, technical sub-committees at the regional level (many that already exist) will be called upon to
provide specific technical know-how and advise on given project proposals. The senior technical officer
from the relevant line ministry or parastatal body will be the contact person for the NCRRR in order to
co-ordinate appropriate technical reviews of ERSF project proposals. NCRRR will make available to
sub-committee members or specified technical personnel in the regions adequate logistical support to
facilitate these technical reviews of proposals. Finally, NCRRR will rely on the line ministry departments
to help monitor project implementation-- especially regarding technical specifications and norms.
District level NCRRR staff responsible for monitoring ERSF project implementation will be responsible
for securing the close co-ordination of line ministry personnel at the same level when specific technical
matters of project implementation are being considered.
Given the special nature of the line ministry departments as the co-ordinator of all national activities for
their respective sectors, and as the regulating body in terms of technical norms and procedures, the
process whereby the line ministries apply to and are financed under the ERSF will vary slightly. First,
any project submitted by a district or regional line ministry office must be endorsed by the appropriate
central ministry department. Second, in the event of a national level project activity (such as for an
information campaign, staff training, etc.), the proposal to the ERSF would be submitted directly to
NCRRR at the central level, and would be reviewed by the National ERSF Projects Committee. Third,
fund disbursement for activities implemented through line ministry departments would have to be
consistent with the financial management requirements of the Government, as well as abide by the
procedures of the FMPU.
Any and all questions regarding the ERSF should be directed to the nearest district or regional NCRRR office (in
Bo, Makeni, Kenema, or the district headquarters towns). Those organizations based in Freetown may seek
information on the ERSF from the central office of the Commission (39 Siaka Stevens Street, tel: 226032) however,
proposals should be submitted through the office nearest to the point where the project would be implemented.

TERMS OF REFERENCE
Assessment of the Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation Project
Pilot Phase
Background
The Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation Project (CRRP) and the related Emergency Recovery
Support Fund (ERSF), and Training and Employment Program (TEP) are Government of Sierra Leone
initiatives co-ordinated by the National Commission for Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation
(NCRRR) and the National Committee on Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (NCDDR) to
help address the negative social and economic affects of more than seven years of civil war and ten
months of junta rule. The Commission and Committee have been charged with the responsibility of
helping rebuild the country and will do so in collaboration with key donor and implementing partner
organisations. Several donor organisations, including the World Bank, the African Development Bank,
and the UNDP, support the efforts of these Government institutions to address the urgent needs of
resettling displaced people and refugees, restoring basic social services and infrastructure in the war
affected areas, reintegrating ex-combatants, and addressing the needs of peace building and
reconciliation. The CRRP also supports labour-intensive public works activities designed to assist the
most vulnerable members of society.
The CRRP finances community based sub-projects which address the priority needs of internally
displaced persons, refugees, former combatants, and other vulnerable groups in both rural and urban
areas throughout the country. These sub-projects address multi-sectoral needs; starting with more urgent
food production and temporary shelter, and running through medium and longer term concerns for basic
infrastructure repair and rehabilitation of productive assets. The sub-projects are implemented by eligible
partners which include international and national NGOs, government line ministries, existing donor
project units, and qualified community based organisations. As the financial resources available through
CRRP can only begin to support the long process of rebuilding the country; the Project also looks to
catalysing the self-help efforts of each village and community.
The Project and the ERSF have been designed through a process of consultation, investigation, and
consensus-building initiated by the earlier Ministry of National Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and
Resettlement in mid-1996. The ERSF relies on a decentralised bottom-up project planning, approval and
monitoring process which taps into and builds upon existing systems and structures at the regional and
local levels. NGOs, line ministries and other entities develop project proposals in close collaboration
with village, section and chiefdom authorities. Regional NCRRR staff have primary responsibility for
day-to-day management of the project review process. Regional inter-agency committees have been
formed and given the responsibility to approve projects up to a maximum given level. NCRRR
headquarters' staff provide the broad policy and programme planning framework for the ERSF, monitor
its implementation and co-ordinate the overall process.
In anticipation of an IDA credit worth more than US$20 million, the World Bank is supporting NCRRR
and the ERSF to carry out pilot activities during latter 1998 and early 1999. More than 20 projects worth
almost US$1 million have been reviewed and approved, and have begun implementation under the
Bank's Project Preparation Facility. In light of the innovative nature of the Fund, and the high degree of
inter-agency collaboration and co-operation called for in it implementation, the Government and the
World Bank have decided that a detailed review of the ERSF is required before larger-scale
implementation begins. These terms of reference are for that review.

Overall Objective
Improve the effectiveness of the project review, approval, contracting and implementation of the GOSL's
Emergency Recovery Support Fund.
Survey Objectives
A. Determine if the community-based, demand driven strategy of the ERSF has worked to identify and
implement adequate numbers of projects that are of appropriate quality;
B. Determine if any specific type of project, implementing partner, design or implementation strategy
works best (and worst) at achieving the overall goals of the Fund and the National RRR Programme;
C. Assess to what degree approved projects reflect the priorities of a broad cross-section of the
communities in which the projects are implemented.
Specific Tasks and Outputs
1.    Design an assessment strategy and tool(s) to evaluate the implementation of the ERSF that would
be reviewed by NCRRR.
2.    As appropriate, identify local partners and enter into agreement to assist with the implementation
of the assessment.
3.    Review relevant project documentation; i.e., ERSF Manual, project proposals, review documents,
minutes from project committee meetings, contracts, etc.
4.    Interview implementing partners at national and regional levels with experience in submitting
proposals to the ERSF, implementing ERSF projects, or participated in the project review process on their
experience with the proposal development, review and approval process.
5.    Interview NCRRR staff, ERSF Project Committee members, and technical line ministry
representatives on the project review and approval process.
6.    Evaluate level of community input in project identification, design and implementation.
7.    Assess effectiveness of fund disbursement mechanisms from NCRRR to ERSF implementing
partners.
8.    Assess implementing partners' adherence to contract responsibilities in terms reporting, record
keeping and procurement.
9.    Assess NCRRR's performance in terms of financial and technical record keeping and project
monitoring.
10.   Conduct a workshop involving major stakeholders to the ERSF to discuss findings of the
assessment and to identify possible improvements to the ERSF review, approval and implementation
process.
11.   Prepare a final report to Government within 4 weeks of the conclusion of the assessment
recommending changes or adjustments to the ERSF and outlining a plan of action to put in place the
recommendations.

Social Safety Net Component of the CRRP
It has been agreed with Government that as part of the Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation
Project (CRRP) a social safety net component would be implemented that would focus on labor-intensive
public works programs. The target beneficiaries of this temporary safety net would be ex-combatants,
unemployed urban youth, and members of recently returned rural communities, and other traditional
vulnerable groups such as female-headed households, etc. The safety net component will be operational
for the same three-year period that the CRRP will be effective.
After careful consideration of worldwide experiences with social safety net schemes, and consultations
with likely implementing partners and Government authorities responsible for relevant aspects of such an
intervention, the following observations and recommendations are made.
Project Design and Selection Criteria
1. Wage rate is the critical determinant of targeting as well as distribution of benefits in favor of poor
participants. In general, a wage that is close to or slightly below the prevailing market wage for
unskilled labor is most likely to encourage self-selection of the poor into the program, to maximize
the amount of temporary employment created under the program. Based on an assessment of current
market practices, related works programs managed by the Sierra Leonean Works Authority, and non-
governmental organizations' food-for-work activities, the prevailing daily rate is approximately
Le.1,500. This finding is roughly consistent with earlier findings of World Bank missions.
Therefore, it is recommended that the wage rate for the CRRP's social safety net component not
exceed this level.
2. Share of wages to total project cost. As the first objective of this component is to provide for
temporary employment opportunities for the identified vulnerable groups, the component should
strive to maximize the labor content of funded projects. Based on both reviews of proposed projects,
and experience in similar countries, the labor component of a projectI should represent
approximately 50% of the total cost. Therefore, a target range of 40 to 70 percent should be
recommended for the CRRP, depending on the type and location of a project. Projects with labor
costs above this range would not ensure adequate quality of the completed projects, and below this
range would not meet the objective of the program.
3. Geographic targeting. In order to make it easiest for the identified vulnerable groups to participate
in the component, and therefore reduce transaction costs, it is recommended that proposed activities
target those areas where there is general agreement that the concentration of poverty is greatest. For
instance, in Freetown such areas include Goderich, Congo Town/Banana Water areas, Dworzak
Farm, Redpump, Kroobay, OdokokolMountain Court, Mabella, Ginger Hall, and many pockets in
Kissy and Wellington. In addition, those rural communities that have recently returned home
(i.e., the majority of the population having arrived within the previous 12 months) should be targeted.
4. Other design features.  Project designs should include other features that facilitate broad
participation; for example, piece-rate or task-based payment, flexible timing of participation (where
possible), provision of day care arrangements, and timing not to conflict with other demands such as
planting season, or the school year for youths.
Labor costs directed at the target group or groups; i.e., excluding supervisory and/or management personnel costs



Technical Annex                                        Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation
Sierra Leone                                                         Attachment 13: Page 2 of 4
Project Identification and Development
While the CRRP wishes to target those vulnerable groups identified for the social safety net component
of the Project, the overall implementation strategy of the CRRP is to use a community-based demand
driven project identification and development process. This same strategy is advisable for the social
safety net component for consistency sake and also to encourage that the social and/or economic
infrastructure created, rehabilitated or maintained through the public works activity is considered a
priority by the community that will ultimately use it.
Therefore, it is expected that NGOs, line ministries, or public authorities (such as SLRA) will prepare
project proposals through consultation with relevant communities and/or identified vulnerable groups.
By doing so, not only will the priorities of the community be better expressed in the project design, but
the ownership of the end-product greater-- thus encouraging on-going community maintenance of the
asset.
Project proposals must demonstrate that the requisite technical input, standards and/or norms have been
taken into consideration and that appropriate technical supervision will be available for project
implementation. For instance, road rehabilitation or maintenance activities should reflect the SLRA
norms and should cater for adequate monitoring, works rehabilitation proposals should have standard
drawings and bills of quantities attached (if appropriate), works involving sanitation, agriculture or
reforestation should indicate how the relevant line ministries (health and agriculture) have been consulted
in project design and will be involved in implementation.
Project Review and Selection
It is recommended that the proposed ERSF project review and approval procedures overseen by NCRRR
be used for the social safety net component of the CRRP. The same staff and organizational structures
are capable of handling these types of projects, and the inter-agency review process will help guarantee
both technical suitability of projects and coordination with other similar activities (such as food for work
or food for agriculture). Specific technical criteria (indicated below) should be incorporated into the
ERSF Operational Manual and be used in reviewing and assessing these types of public works projects.
Technical review and inter-agency approval structures have been established to assess and select
community based projects that are adequately suited to the task of reviewing labor-intensive works
projects. The recent revisions to the institutional structure of NCRRR that include adding a Western Area
office and seeking civil engineers for district level posts, will facilitate the inclusion of public works
project proposals in the review process. As with the ERSF, NCRRR is the coordinating institution and
financing channel for project activities; the actual implementing agencies will be the partner
organizations to the ERSF; namely NGOs, line ministries, and public authorities.
Specific Review Criteria
*   The component's priority should be to create temporary employment among the most vulnerable,
while at the same time optimizing the social, economic and/or physical infrastructure of the
community and, if possible, be oriented toward further job creation and/or income generation.
*   Project wage rate should not exceed the prevailing market wage for unskilled labor. At present,
the wage rate varies, depending on location. The average daily wage rate for unskilled labor is
approximately Le 1,500. The monthly wage for unskilled labor varies, between Le 35,000 and Le
45,000 (for 25 working days).
*   The total wage component for unskilled labor of the public works project should be equal to or
exceed 50 percent of the total project cost, on average.

Depending on the type of public works and the location, wages could be paid in both cash and in-
kind (i.e., food), however, the total value should not exceed a daily wage rate of Le.1, 500 as
discussed above. Discussions between SLRA and NGOs, for instance, suggest that for the
implementation of all food-aid projects, 30% of the labor cost shall be paid in food and 70% in
cash.
*   The project encourages to create linkages between the proposed public works schemes and the
productivity with which the works are carried out, through incorporating a piece-rate or task-
based payment system for laborers. (SLRA's Feeder Roads Department, for instance, has
established wage rates per man-day for 18 different road rehabilitation activities).
*  Proposed public works projects need to be consistent with existing labor laws.
*   Proposed public works projects need to be technically feasible and proposals must demonstrate
that appropriate technical norms and design standards will be adhered to.
*   Targeted communities should participate in project design and the services or works to be
delivered should respond to the needs of these groups.
*   Timing and design of services/works should, to the extent possible, encourage broadest
participation and reduce opportunity costs of participation through seasonal timing (i.e., not
during the planting or harvesting seasons) and flexible working arrangements (such as piece meal
work).
*   The number of laborers at any one-job site should range between 50 and 75, and should not
exceed 100.
*   During the pilot phase of the ERSF, it is not recommended that any one public works project
exceed $150,000 in value.
*   The implementing partners proposing the public works projects need to ensure a reliable and
regular flow of funds for the payment of workers and put in place a financial management system
that promotes the expedient implementation of the works.
*   To the extent possible, proposed public works programs should be targeting communities where
there is general agreement that the concentration of poverty is greatest. In the initial phase of the
project, the identification of the poor will be based on geographic targeting. Priority will be given
to pockets of poor in urban areas and recently returned communities in rural areas. The needs of
particular vulnerable groups, such as ex-combatants, unemployed youth or female-headed
households, will be addressed through these broader geographically targeted programs.
Financing Modalities
The same financing procedures proposed for the overall ERSF should also apply to the social safety net
component of the CRRP. Namely, once a contract with an implementing partner is authorized by
NCRRR, the Financial Management and Procurement Unit will manage all financial disbursements to the
organization. The FMPU will be established as an autonomous unit reporting to NCRRR but which will
operate independently from normnal fund disbursement procedures of the public sector. Financial staff of
NCRRR at regional levels and in the Western Area will have responsibility for reviewing monthly
financial reports from implementing partners. It will be the responsibility of the implementing agencies
to guarantee timely disbursement of wages to laborers.

Implementation Mechanisms
The mission met with various Government agencies and NGO organizations and was able to confirm the
conclusion of previous World Bank missions that considerable capacity exists in Sierra Leone, both in the
private sector and in the local and international NGO community, to carry out labor-intensive public
works programs. Since a recent CRRP mission, in May'98, several public works activities have been
initiated or are being prepared. WFP implementing partners alone will employ 78,000 people for food-
for-agriculture activities over a five-month period from May to September of the current year. NGOs like
CARE, CRS, and World Vision have also been implementing food-for-a.griculture programs during the
ongoing rainy season and are preparing food-for-work programs for the upcoming dry season. Certain
organizations are also contemplating cash-for-work programs. During recent discussions between the
government (SLRA) and some of its implementing partners (NGOs), agreement was reached that for the
implementation of all food-aid projects, 30% of the labor cost shall be paid in food and 70% in cash.
In addition, the Government is encouraging linkages between the proposed public works schemes and the
productivity with which the works are carried out. In particular, through incorporating a piece-rate or
task-based payment system for laborers. SLRA's Feeder Roads Department, for instance, has established
piece rates per man-day for 18 different road rehabilitation activities. To improve implementation
capacity in Moyamba, Bonthe and Pujehan districts, SLRA field staff and several small-scale contractors
are currently involved in refresher courses and skills upgrading training on emergency spot improvement
of feeder roads and bridges. The Ministry of Youth has prepared several public works proposals for urban
youth, and Civil Development Units have continued to mobilize urban youth to do voluntary work such
as garbage cleaning. These developments indicate a growing capacity to plan and implement public
works programs in both urban as well as rural Sierra Leone. The mission is of the opinion that for the
implementation of its Social Safety Net component, the CRRP can largely rely on this increasing
capacity.
Monitoring and Evaluation
The established procedures and mechanisms in place for monitoring the ERSF will be used to monitor the
labor-intensive works activities.  Specifically, district level staff (supervisors and community
development officers) and the Western Area manager and project officer will monitor specific indicators
of progress. These will include timely payment of wages, level of employment created (man-days),
timely completion of works, and quality of works. In assessing the latter two aspects of the physical
works carried out, NCRRR staff will seek the assistance of the Government line ministries and public
authorities as necessary.
