IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Bank's lending operations. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are
innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons. The operations, topics, and analytical approaches selected for assessment support larger
evaluation studies.
       A Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the Implementation Completion
Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department) and fieldwork conducted by IEGWB. To prepare
PPARs, IEGWB staff examine project files and other documents, interview operational staff, and in most cases
visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with staff of the Bank and the government, other stakeholders,
and beneficiaries. The PPAR thereby seeks to validate and augment the information provided in the ICR, as well
as examine issues of special interest to broader IEGWB studies.
     Each PPAR is subject to peer review and IEGWB management approval. Once cleared internally, the PPAR
is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then sent to
the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of
Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEGWB Rating System
     The time-tested evaluation methods used by IEGWB are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work.
The methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Following
is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional information is available on the
IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance of objectives, efficacy, and efficiency.
Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's current
development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals
(expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or expected to be
achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project achieved, or is
expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to
alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings: High, Significant, Moderate, Negligible to
Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
achievement of development objectives and sustainability. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency performance. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface
        This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) on an education
project in Malawi.
        The Secondary Education Project (Cr. 3051) was approved on March 24, 1998 for a
credit of US$48.2 million equivalent. The Credit closed on December 31, 2005 after
extensions totaling 30 months, and disbursed fully.
        This project was the subject of a PPAR because Malawi was one of a few
countries that specifically invested in secondary education in sub-Saharan Africa. Efforts
were made to gain insights regarding the results chain in this subsector and the ultimate
effects of secondary education projects on labor-market skills.
         The document is based on the following sources: Implementation Completion
Reports (ICR), Project Appraisal Document (PAD), Development Credit Agreement, and
project files, particularly the supervision reports. Also, IEG consulted the research
literature, reports on Malawi, and data on schooling trends. An IEG mission visited
Malawi in July 2009, to interview officials, donors, and beneficiaries, observe instruction
in schools, and collect other pertinent information. Field visits took place in Blantyre,
Lilongwe, and various rural areas. The author thanks the government officials who
received the mission for their extensive cooperation.
      Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to
government officials and agencies for their review and comments. However, no
comments were received.

Summary
        This document reviews the performance of the Secondary Education Project (Cr.
3051) approved in FY98. The development objective of the project was to increase the
number of students from disadvantaged groups who graduate from public and private
secondary schools with higher performance in Malawi. More specifically, the project
aimed to expand access, improve educational quality, increase systemic efficiency and
effectiveness, provide materials to stem the spread of HIV/AIDS, strengthen
implementation capacity, and encourage provision of private secondary education.
        The project reflected a government commitment to develop secondary education
while still in the process of expanding primary education access. The investment was
oriented towards the inputs needed to enable an additional 9600 students to attend
secondary schools. It included construction of 20 schools in underserved areas, training
of administrators, textbook acquisition, administrative support, and materials aimed at
stemming the spread of HIV/AIDS. Despite limited implementation capacity and delays,
most planned activities were carried out. Most student places were filled, and access to
secondary education substantially increased in conventional schools. However, the
poorest students may be unable to afford the various fees charged by these schools.
Overall, the number of boys and girls who stay in school and transition to higher
secondary education has increased. However, the project had a limited effect on
enrollments at the national level because it offered no benefits to the majority of the
students who attend community day schools.
        The project was less successful in providing students with knowledge that would
enable them to pass examinations and meet labor market demands. Textbooks were
procured and rented to students, but provision could not be sustained. A revolving fund
was established to help schools take over future textbook procurement, but funds were
insufficient, and bilateral donor aid for the fund was unexpectedly reduced. After project
completion, schools had infrastructure priorities and rarely acquired textbooks. Thus, few
textbooks remained available in schools by 2009. Most of the classroom time is spent on
transcription of textbook contents, first to the blackboard, then to students' notebooks.
Given a teacher absenteeism rate of about 20 percent, little time remains for covering the
prescribed curriculum, learning the material, and preparing graduates for the labor
market. Learning inefficiencies result in relatively low pass rates in the secondary school
leaving certificate and continuing high repetition rates. Overall, educational quality seems
to have deteriorated rather than improved in the country. The outcome of the Secondary
Education Project is rated moderately unsatisfactory.
        Risk to development outcome is rated significant; although there is much demand
for secondary education, the maintenance status of the new buildings and sustainability of
expenditures are uncertain. Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory, due to a
moderately satisfactory quality at entry, a high turnover of task managers, and a limited
attention to the educational components of the project. Borrower performance is rated
unsatisfactory, because of long-term delays, scarcity of counterpart funds, failure to
appoint competent staff to manage the project, and governance issues.
                                             x


This assessment provides a number of lessons for the education sector:

  Civil works have procurement issues that may exceed the supervisory capacity of the
  implementing units in low-income countries. Private-sector contractors may be able to
  execute civil works, but a lack of supervision may result in fraud, vandalism, and
  poor-quality buildings. The complexities of civil-works procurement may become the
  focus of education projects at the expense of learning issues. Governments should
  make efforts to employ staff with continuity and expertise that would ensure efficient
  execution of civil works and allow managers time to focus on learning-related
  improvements.

  Textbooks or systematically reproduced materials are a prerequisite for knowledge
  management at all levels of education. Their sustained availability should be a policy
  priority, particularly in countries where they are expensive. Without textbooks and
  training of teachers in their use, class time is spent in transcription; knowledge
  becomes constricted and systemic efficiency is low. Because of their crucial role,
  decisions on textbook purchases might best not be left to the discretion and financial
  strength of individual schools. A national strategy of sustainable and affordable
  secondary education textbooks is needed in low-income countries.

  Often projects provide inputs to educational institutions and expect improved learning
  outcomes as a result of these. To help students process information and retain it,
  however, instructionally oriented interventions are needed. Project designs lacking
  specific elements for improving the learning conditions of schools may not obtain the
  needed learning and subsequent educational outcomes.

  Large-scale curricular reforms will only have a positive effect if curricula are
  realistically implementable in classrooms. The Bank should be more proactive in
  advising governments on realistic curricular structures. Since curricular revisions often
  necessitate new textbooks, it is important to ensure that there is sufficient rationale for
  the revisions.

      1. Background
1.1     Malawi is an agricultural, landlocked, densely populated country of about 14.4
million people with a US$250 per capita income. The official language is English, but the
majority of the population speaks Chichewa, which serves as the medium of instruction
for grades 1-3. The literacy rate is about 72 percent for men and 49 percent for women.
However, educational attainment is improving. During the last decade, the proportion of
men who had never attended school dropped from 21 percent to 12 percent, while that of
women dropped from 47 percent to 23 percent.1

The Education Sector in Malawi
1.2    Malawi has an eight-year primary school followed by 4 years of secondary. The
primary school grades are called "standard" 1-8, while the secondary grades are "form"
1-4. Entry to secondary school is selective. At the end of Form 2 (grade 10) students take
the Junior Certificate examination (JCE), and at the end of Form 4 (grade 12), they take
the Malawi School Certificate Examination (MSCE) for graduation (University entrance
examinations take place separately.)

1.3     Primary schools in Malawi have about 3.6 million students (MOE 2008, p. 51),
and secondary schools have about 210,000. Enrollment rates were low until 1994, when
primary tuition fees were abolished. The influx of students has severely strained the
system, and standards in schools have been declining. Grade 1-2 classes in many areas
have over 100 students. About 40 percent of primary school entrants drop out by grade 6,
about 60 percent drop out by grade 8, and primary-education completion rates are
stationary (Figure 1-2). Nevertheless, the enrollment surge has increased demand for
secondary education, which has risen from 31,495 in 1990 to about 233,573 in 2008
(Figure 1-1, MOE 2008 and Education Sector Support Project, PAD p. 26).

examination, students are assigned to different school types. These are "conventional"
secondary schools,2 Community Day Secondary Schools (CDSS), Open Day Secondary
Schools, and private schools. The better students attend conventional schools, and lower
scoring students attend community schools (approved and unapproved; MOE 2008, p.
83). The students not selected into public facilities may attend low-cost private schools
that have very poor infrastructure and materials or "open" schools that operate in regular
schools in the afternoons or evenings. Due to space limitations in public secondary
schools most children who pass national examinations at the end of the primary school
cycle are unable to continue (Country Status Report 2008).

1.5     At the time the project was appraised in 1996, only those enrolled in
"conventional" public and private schools were considered secondary education students.
Other poorer students, (who were 46 percent in 20003 and by 2008 constituted 67 percent
of the student population, according to MOE 2008) attended distance education centers.
These had been supported by the third and fifth education projects (Cr. 910 and 1330),
and were run by the Malawi College of Distance Education.4 They used primary school
teachers to monitor students, few of whom could handle the secondary-level material on
their own. In 2004, most distance education centers were converted into Community Day
Secondary Schools. These schools, which are generally in rural areas, have a poor-
quality infrastructure. Some were constructed by the community, while others used
buildings constructed for distance education, or for primary education in the afternoons.
Even after their conversion to community day secondary schools, almost half (289 of
630; MOE 2008) remain unapproved.

1.6      Distance from school also determines ability to attend. Secondary schools of any
type are relatively few, about 769 in 2008, and many students depend on boarding
facilities. About 53 of the conventional schools have boarding, though a number of
community schools have informal dormitories as well. Until the advent of the secondary
education project, boarding schools provided highly-subsidized feeding and
accommodation regardless of means.

  Conventional schools consist of four government national schools, grant-aided secondary schools, district
boarding secondary schools, and day secondary schools. Grant-aided schools are generally considered
public because teachers are being funded by the government. Around 2007 there were about 10,258
secondary school teachers in Malawi, of which 8,026 are working in government-funded schools.
Community schools have the highest number of teachers (60 percent). Only about 20 percent are female,
and they tend to be concentrated in urban and other semi-urban centers. About 60 percent of the teachers
are not qualified to teach in secondary schools (81 percent in community schools vs. only 27 percent in
conventional schools; Country Status Report 2009).

 The Malawi College of Distance Education offered studies for primary and secondary diplomas; it had
high pass rates for the junior certificate (88-100 percent), but very low rates for the MCDE (9-11 percent in
1996-1997; Laymaman circa 1998). Given the observations of the IEG mission, it is possible that students
had very limited knowledge of English and low reading rates.

Bank Sector Strategy
1.7     The Bank has supported secondary education in Malawi since the first project,
approved in 1967 (Table 1-1). Seven of the 10 completed projects supported various
aspects of this level of education, mainly through infrastructure; each built a few
secondary schools or teacher training centers. The first and second project focused on
secondary education at the general and technical levels. The third project established the
Malawi Institute of Education and expanded the secondary education training program at
Chancellor College. The fourth established 3,960 new secondary student places and
further expanded the Chancellor College's secondary teacher training program. The fifth
education project (Cr. 1330) supported the Malawi Correspondence College, which at
that time provided alternative secondary education to 30 percent of the secondary
education students (World Bank 1983).5

1.8     Other donors have also been involved in secondary education. These include the
African Development Bank (ADB), UNICEF, and bilateral donors such as GTZ, DFID,
CIDA, and DANIDA.6 In secondary education donor collaboration has been limited in
the past, but donor harmonization procedures have recently been established for
subsequent investments.

       2. Project Objectives and Relevance
2.1    Table 2-1 refers to project objectives and components as stated in the PAD. The
evaluation follows the PAD objectives, because they refer to performance and to private
education.

  The objective is stated differently in p. 2 and 14 of the Project Appraisal Document but there is
complementarity. The Development Credit Agreement objective has small differences in wording with the
PAD objective of p. 2, but the meaning is substantially similar. It stated: The objectives of the Project are to
support the Borrower's plan to expand and improve secondary education through: (i) expanding access by
constructing new secondary schools; (ii) improving the quality of education by providing teaching and
learning materials; (iii) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the secondary education system by
strengthening school-based management through the provision of training; and (iv) stemming the spread of
HIV/AIDS among teachers and students through the provision of materials and training. This document
follows the PAD objectives, because they refer to performance and to private education.

Relevance
2.2     Objectives were highly relevant; the project development objectives have been
consistent with the Government's Secondary Education Strategy and long-term
objectives as defined in the 1996 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS; no. 15494). The
strategy was focused on economic growth and support for human resources development.
The objectives remained relevant with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Plan (PRSP) and
2007 CAS (Report No. 25906-MAI), which seeks to improve among other things,
delivery of education services, textbooks and materials, girls' education and HIV/AIDS
education. The objectives were also in harmony with the government's sectoral plans.8

2.3      Overall, the design was modestly relevant to project objectives. There was a need
to invest in secondary education because this level of knowledge is necessary for the
preparation of primary teachers and workers of other professions. According to the PAD
(p. 7), the project was narrowly conceived in order to target some of the immediate
problems in secondary education as quickly as possible. The project focused on the
relatively few "conventional" secondary schools, expecting to create "centers of
excellence". At the time of the appraisal, community schools were still considered
distance education centers. (They were converted in 2004, when the project was about to
end.) The project did not take equity considerations into account. It did not attempt to
serve the schools that at that time contained almost half of the secondary education
student population. No plans were made to give them textbooks, other than AIDS
information, or to train their administrators. The project made the implicit assumption
that providing inputs to conventional schools would improve learning outcomes, but the
design did not contain specific elements to ensure that the inputs would be used for
student learning and quality improvement. Furthermore the project promoted a policy of
closing dormitories because of costs (MOE 1996)9, without due consideration to the
transportation realities of many students, particularly for girls. After facing many
problems, the government has revived the use of dormitories, though subsidies have been
reduced or removed.


        3. Project Implementation
3.1    During appraisal, efforts were made to speed up implementation early on through
a Project Preparation Facility (PPF for US$1.5m) to finance the preparation of initial
procurement packages and some studies. However, implementation proved unusually
challenging. The problems included constant delays in counterpart funding, lack of
procurement experience, difficulty finding suitable staff or consultants, high staff
turnover, governance issues, poor financial accounting. By mid-term review in 2001,

  This MOE 1996 policy document specified that to convert to secondary schools, communities would be
required to construct four teacher houses, for which the government would provide roofing materials. Once
boarding services were phased out, tuition fees would be raised in line with cost sharing mechanisms
designed for secondary education.
                                                    6


only 13 percent of the funds had been disbursed, and the delays ultimately necessitated
extensions totaling 30 months. The complications related to execution of civil works and
procurement detracted the implementers' attention from the educational goals of the
project.

3.2     The section below discusses the implementation of the most important activities
of this project. For a complete list of inputs, outputs, and outcomes see Annex Table A-
1.

Expanding Access to Secondary Education
3.3     The project was to build 20 secondary schools, 15 of them in rural areas. The
installations would include teacher housing, laboratories, libraries, and assembly halls.
The new schools had no dormitories, and students were expected to commute from an
approximate distance of 10 km. Construction proved unexpectedly difficult because
building costs had been underestimated, and local contractors had little experience with
large buildings. The educational development management unit (EDMU) had little
supervisory capacity, and the architectural firm that was hired similarly failed to
supervise the construction adequately. As a result, several schools were built with various
problems, including the use of lower-quality materials. Project files contain several
documents expressing concerns regarding contractor performance. After lengthy delays,
however, the 20 secondary schools were built and furnished, creating 9,600 additional
places for secondary education.

3.4    The IEG mission visited three of the schools built by the project (Figure 3-1: and

community day schools. However, these large structures have substantial recurrent

Community Day Secondary Schools of Ngumbe, Mdeka, Haluka, Msalura; and the Mangissa private
secondary school. Also, the mission visited the Msaruwa, Mdeka, Chichiri, and Magankula primary schools
(for grades 1-8). The sample is based on convenience and used for illustration rather than rating projects.

expenditures, such as watchmen, grounds maintenance, librarians, and lab assistants. The
government cannot afford the expenses, so parents' committees that exist in all schools of
Malawi, must determine how funds are to be found. Since communities typically are
poor, their fundraising potential is limited; so the expenditures are apportioned to
students as fees. Tuition is nominally low (500 kwacha per term), but other fees are much
higher. These include a school development fund, general purpose fund, parent-teacher
association fee. Each of these fee categories amounts to 500-3500 kwacha per term
(about US$30), so schooling may cost about US$100 per year (aside from boarding
which may cost another US$50; Figure 3-3:).

Provision of Instructional Materials
3.5     The project was to provide textbooks, school supplies, and consumables for
sciences to the project-financed schools as well as to the other 93 public conventional
schools. (Only the 20 schools got reference books.) By mid-term review in 2001, many
essential textbooks had been procured. Following procurement, the curricula in some
subjects were changed, and some of the delivered textbooks were not in conformity with
the new curricula. Furthermore, governance issues arose with textbook procurement,
because a company that won a bid had incorrect documents and proved incapable of
delivering the textbooks. After lengthy delays and distribution failures, all textbooks and
instructional materials were delivered to schools in 2005.

3.6      In 2000, the project set up a book rental scheme for which students would pay a
flat fee of 250 kwacha per year (about US$1.50). Rental fees were set nationally, but
individual secondary schools were responsible for collection and deposit in school bank
accounts and for secure maintenance of the accumulated fees. It was expected that
schools would have a choice of textbooks written on the same subject by different
authors. Publishers were to develop manuscripts on the basis of the syllabi and submit
them for approval to the Malawi Institute of Education. The top three choices were to be
available for purchase by the headmasters and displayed in book fairs. Other potential
textbooks were made available as reference books. The MOE was to consolidate the
purchases in order to "obtain some degree of discount" (PAD p. 20). It was expected that
                                                      8


after five years of matching fund support, schools would have accumulated sufficient
funding to order replacements.

3.7      The scheme was designed in close association with local publishing and
bookselling associations, and it had a stimulating effect on both parts of the local book
trade. The mid-term review aide memoire (March 12, 2001) stated that the Planning
Directorate would monitor the effective use of textbooks. A 2002 baseline study (ICR p.
10) showed that textbooks provided by the project to conventional schools were
facilitating instruction, since teachers did not have to transcribe lessons on the
blackboard. Ultimately, however, the book scheme faced unforeseen obstacles;
DANIDA initially provided a matching fund and paid publishers whose books were
chosen, but for political issues, DANIDA ended its operations in the country and stopped
the subsidy.

3.8     With the book rental fees of 250 kwacha per year, the schools cannot afford to
buy the books they need. Each costs US$10-15 (1000-1800 kwacha), so it takes the
rental income of six students to buy one book that will last about three years. About 85
percent of the students pay the fees, but many schools divert part of the textbook rental
fees for other purposes, and almost 50 percent of the collected rental fees cannot be
accounted for (Verspoor, 2008, p. 158). Textbook choice has proved impractical by
complicating procedures. (Many headmasters of remote schools could not attend the few
book fairs that have been held.) So, as student numbers rose and textbook stocks were
not replaced, textbook use proved unsustainable.11 The few books that exist are kept in
the school library, and students may check them out (Figure 3-5: and Figure 3-6:).

   Primary school reading practice impacts secondary education. In primary schools, textbooks should be
available for each student, but in reality there are 2-3 students per textbook; in particular, textbooks in
grades 1-2 are kept in school, have low usage rates, and students are kept illiterate (Calcon 2007). Students
usually cannot spend much time practicing reading or learning much English. Scarcity and poor time use
may account for delayed reading of primary students. These factors may also account for the statistical
finding that textbook availability in Malawi (aside from Chichewa books) has little impact on learning
achievement. The books might be available at schools but not in students' hands, thus having no effect on
learning (Country Status Report 2009).

Community day secondary schools can only afford       Notification: "If you return the books over this
to buy a few copies of each textbook                  date, you will pay K20 as the late return penalty"

3.9     Curricular reform. The project documents mentioned that curricula would be
revised, but there were no specifics as to inadequacies of existing curricula and rationale
for the revisions, given the effort and expense of obtaining suitable textbooks. Persons
interviewed during the mission mentioned the need for periodic curricular revisions
regardless of any textbook issues that might arise. For example, in 2008, it was decided
that outcome-based curricula should be adopted in Malawi, as have been in other
countries (e.g. Burkina Faso), with little attention to the feasibility of doing so. Revising
curricula independently of textbooks (particularly in a country where price and scarcity
are paramount issues), risks undermining the amount of information students receive in
class. Little attention seems to be paid to this issue.

TRAINING ON SCHOOL-LEVEL MANAGEMENT AND TEACHER SUPPORT
3.10 There was a need to train school administrators on issues such as leadership,
vision, organization, staffing, rules, discipline, gender sensitivity, HIVAIDS, financial
management, and community relations. The project financed the development of training
modules on school-based management and provided three-week training courses for all
school administrators and advisors. The Malawi Institute of Education was partly
responsible for this activity.

3.11 Eight trainers were recruited in a pilot group of Educational Methods Advisors of
MOE and they developed eight modules: school improvement, classroom organization,
training of trainers, gender awareness, financial management, guidance and counseling,
effective and efficient use of instructional materials. The first workshop was held in
December 2000. Eventually all administrators of conventional schools received training
(Annex Table A-1).

HIV/AIDS MATERIALS REPRODUCTION AND ADOPTION
3.12 This component was to finance a rapid adaptation of high-quality, behavior-
change instructional materials from UNICEF-Zimbabwe, and the reprinting of some of
materials. These were to be produced in 180,000 copies. By the 2001 mid-term review,
                                                  10


an AIDS expert had not been hired, local consultants had not yet adapted them,
permission to reprint had not been received from Zimbabwe, and other materials
available in Malawi seemed more effective. Consultants produced four draft sets of
materials that were to be finalized through a needs assessment workshop (Kadzamira et
al. 2001). Also, information regarding HIV/AIDS has been incorporated into life skills
textbooks (Figure 3-7:). Eventually booklets were produced, but the IEG mission received
conflicting information on whether 180,000 were distributed to schools.

SUPPORT TO ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT, MONITORING AND EVALUATION, AND STUDIES
3.13 The project supported the educational development management unit (EDMU)
that had functioned as a project implementation unit in earlier and subsequent projects.
The objectives were to establish a monitoring system and a computerized financial
management system (Annex Table A-1). Several procurement seminars took place.
Much work was carried out towards establishing financial management capability. Also,
the unit acquired the capability to communicate by email. However, this component
suffered a lot from staff turnover, as experienced employees left for other lucrative
positions. Audit and financial management reports were often submitted late and
contained errors or irregularities.

3.14 Overall management of the project rested with the Planning Department of MOE
(operations unit). However, this unit had little capacity to supervise the EDMU.

      4. Achievement of the Project Objectives
4.1     The project (Table 4-1) had an overarching development objective with specific
objectives, whose fulfillment is outlined below. To provide continuity to present

Note: initial targets were to be fulfilled by 2003, but the project was extended by 30 months

Objective (a): expand access, by constructing 20 new day secondary
schools and related physical facilities (substantial)
4.2     The project succeeded in its objective to construct schools for 9,600 new student
places. Enrolment in the schools has increased over time, although some are still
operating below capacity. The physical target was achieved, and if only the conventional
schools were counted as secondary education, the 9,600 places would increase access by
a substantial 16.1 percent over the 1998 enrollment figures (Figure 4-1: and Annex Table
C-1). However, community day secondary schools entered the formal education system,
and their enrollments increased rapidly. By the end of the project in 2005, 183,854
students were enrolled in secondary education, but project objectives and targets were not
updated when the status of the community day schools changed. The achievement of the
access objective is rated substantial considering the objective as defined during appraisal.
By all counts, however, access to education increased substantially during the project.

4.3     The following paragraphs discuss how access has changed in secondary education
as a whole during the project period. Because of the change in the secondary education
population, some changes are not directly attributable to the project. Disaggregated data
are not always available, but the changes reflect country dialogue during the project and
government policies that were enacted, partly as a result of this dialogue.

were included in the secondary education population


4.4     The ratio of students completing secondary education as a percentage of 17-year
olds did not increase to 26 percent in 2003, as expected (Table 4-1:), but the target was
set on the basis of conventional schools only. Since 2002 the gross enrollment ratio has
remained stable at 16 percent (Country Status Report 2007). Data are not available to
estimate whether various groups of disadvantaged students have higher graduation rates
as a result of the project. Secondary education enrollments have increased about 3.6
percent annually since 2000 (5.3 since 2004; Country Status Report 2009), but many
dropped out. However pass rates show an upward trend (Figure 4.3), so students are now
more likely to complete their education.

4.5     Secondary education has a poverty alleviation potential in Malawi. The relevance
of education for the labor market is indicated by increasing average annual incomes gains
for each additional level of education. Rates of return to education, calculated on the
basis of the 2004 household survey, are extremely high. The additional average income
of people working in 2004 compared to lower educational levels was 14 percent for lower
primary, 60 percent for upper primary, 92 percent for lower secondary, 155 percent for
upper secondary, and 177 percent for technical-vocational education. The income gain
for higher education as compared to TEVET is 440 percent, which demonstrates a severe
shortage of academically trained Malawians. The annual average income in 2004 of an
employed person with a higher education background amounted to almost 45 times the
GDP/per capita, way above the ratio observed in selected other African countries (Annex
Tables C-10 and C11; Country Status Report 2009). These rates reflect the low overall
access to education in Malawi.

4.6      The large demand for secondary education has been filled through enrollments in
schools that have very poor infrastructure and teachers who may only have primary-
school credentials. As a result, student-teacher ratios have remained stable throughout
the life of the project rather than increase (Table 4-2:). The average secondary student-
teacher ratio in Malawi in 2007 was 20, whereas the sub-Saharan Africa average was 28
(Table 4-2:, Annex Table C-2).

EQUITY CONCERNS

4.7      In principle, secondary schools have become available in many rural areas during
the life of the project, either as a result of project-financed construction or as a result of
community day school expansion. Due to a need for school fees, however, they may be
unaffordable to some poor students, particularly if they live some distance from the
schools (see Chapter 3). In particular, the poorest may be unable to afford the more
expensive secondary schools developed by the project. As a result, a number of students
either fail to enroll or drop out for financial reasons. Failure constitutes an extra penalty
by creating wastage in the households that can least afford fees of these well-appointed
schools.12 In some respects, attending the schools built by the project may penalize the
poorest.

4.8     Some students can only afford the community day schools that are cheaper, but
these have lower graduation rates than conventional schools. Also, the poorest may have
attended low-quality primary schools, and when they fall behind in secondary school they
cannot afford private tutoring. The result is financing inequity on multiple issues. Those
who can afford the fees get the benefits of higher-quality subsidized education, while
those who can only attend the self-financing community schools get little benefit from
government and donor funding.

4.9      Overall, secondary education receives much lower public subsidy than primary or
higher education (Figure 3-4: ),13 and the fees have given rise to schooling arrangements
that in some respects resemble private nonprofit schools, where trustees (community
committees) set the prices rather than private owners. This issue has raised concerns
about de facto privatization of schools (Rose 2005). The government has instituted a


12
   One example was the rural Nachitewe secondary school, which was financed by AfDB. According to the
headmaster, about 20 percent of students are forced to drop out because of inability to pay fees of 6250
kwacha per year (about US$37). These include per term 500 for tuition, 500 for school development, 500
for general purpose fund, and 500 for PTA (watchman), as well as 250 kwacha for the first term only for
books. Students unable to pay during the grace period are not allowed to take examinations. As a result,
some students fail not because of poor preparation but because they lack financial assistance. For example,
at the end of the first term in 2009, the number of students enrolled in that school was reduced from 400 to
320.
13
  Nevertheless, Malawi's recurrent allocations to secondary education (adjusted to a 7-year cycle duration
for comparative perspective) are above average, 40.4% against a Sub-Saharan Africa average of 34.4%.
The public annual unit cost per student is estimated to be MK 30,300 (83% GDP per capita versus 30% for
the sub-Saharan Africa average) and it is 4 times higher (in terms of GDP per capita) than it was in 2000.
However this average unit cost hides the disparities between the conventional and the Community Day
Secondary Schools, at the detriment of the latter (Country Status Report 2007).

program of scholarships. But their numbers have been inadequate,14 and means tests to
determine who gets them have not been effective, according to staff interviewed by the
IEG mission.

4.10 The policy to eliminate dormitories without ensuring whether students have
adequate means of transport (and expecting them to come from a radius of 10 kms away)
has also had some adverse effects on the poor. The transportation system of Malawi is
limited and, many students who live 5-10 kms from the schools cannot attend. For all
these reasons, only about 6.615 places had been filled in project schools (43 percent by
girls) at the time the project ended. Since 2005, enrollments to project schools have
increased, although many still operate below capacity. Some are trying to add girls'
dormitories.

GIRLS' ENROLLMENTS

4.11 Girls' enrollments have traditionally been low at all levels, but the government
has made strong efforts to improve them. Gender parity in secondary education was to be
achieved in 2005 (EFA-GMR 2003-04), but girls score lower than boys and have lower
secondary school completion (Figure 4-2:).

4.12 Differences in girls' access to lower secondary education can first be explained by
the primary completion rates but also by some government policies, particularly on
availability of space in boarding schools for boys and girls. In the teenage years there are
also issues of pregnancy, early marriage, and inability to pay tuition (Country Status
Report 2008). Generally all government co-education boarding schools in Malawi have
an access ratio of two boys to every one girl. This difference contributes to the lower
access girls have to secondary education, although secondary day schools have a ratio of
1:1 when they select students.

4.13 The government has made efforts to promote girls' enrolments. It developed a
policy to reserve 50 percent of the spaces for girls, and it has reversed its policy to
eliminate dormitories in order to attract girls to school. As a result of government policies
during the time period of the project, Malawi gender parity index in secondary education
increased from 0.46 in 1990 to 0.69 in 1998 and to 0.76 in 2001. The pass rate for girls
who sat for the examination increased from 17 percent in 1997 to 43 percent in 2004. The
ratio of girls to total students passing rose from 25 to 34 percent between 1997 and 2004,
showing that the gender gap in achievement is narrowing (ICR p. 6). A 2000 survey in
Malawi found almost equal completion rates for boys and girls able to attend school
(Country Status Report 2008, p. 18).

  The appraisal specified that a survey would establish parental willingness to pay for education, and a
broader sector analysis was to feed into the policy dialogue by mid-term review. A study on fees was
indeed conducted (Annex Table A-1), but its impact on setting school fees was uncertain. The project's
implementation problems diverted the attention needed for problems.

Objective (b): Improve educational quality, through provision of
teaching and learning materials in all Government and grant-aided
general ("conventional") secondary schools (Modest)
4.14 Quality of education is difficult to measure, but it should result in improved
learning outcomes. At the secondary level, learning improvements over time are not easy
to measure because achievement tests are rarely standardized. The PAD of the project
used pass rates as proxy indicators of quality. However, public examinations are not
equated from year to year, and they may be easier in some years than others. Also, pass
criteria may change as a result of political decisions to graduate more or fewer students.
Thus, pass rates may not be comparable across time, and they do not necessarily reflect
changes in the quality of education.

4.15 In Malawi, data could not help establish whether the project led to improvements
in learning outcomes and whether performance has become higher over time. The PAD
used as target a marginal improvement in conventional school pass rates, from 58 percent
in 1996 to 60 percent in 2004. In 2006, the pass rate for conventional schools was lower,
53.5 percent (Table 4-4: 15 Therefore, performance seems to have deteriorated. As
mentioned above, these test scores are not standardized, and large fluctuations are
possible from year to year. Also, increased access may have allowed lower-scoring
students to enter, who then lowered pass rates, even if criteria remained constant over
time (Figure 4-3:). Nevertheless, evidence regarding deterioration of performance is
found in multiple sources16 and affects secondary education performance. The
performance is due to a series of issues, discussed below.




15
  Test scores are unavailable for years after 2006. Statistics circa 2005 are often cited because the project
ended at that time.
16
   Evidence of decline is documented by the Southern African Consortium for Monitoring Educational
Quality (SACMEQ) scores and national examination pass rates. The number of 6th graders who reach a
minimum level of mastery in English reading was cut in half in the period from 1998­2004, and in 2004
was barely nine percent. In mathematics, only 2 percent of the students possessed skills beyond basic
numeracy and none of them had skills beyond competent numeracy. Compared to other countries, Malawi
is at the bottom of all the SACMEQ countries in English reading and next to last in mathematics
(selectivity may differ across countries; Annex Table C-3, C-4). In the UNESCO-financed MLA tests
given in 1992-2002, Malawian 8th graders scored low, 43 percent average (41.3% female, 46% male;
Edstats, World Bank 2009).

4.16 Overall, secondary education completion rates in the country show substantial
improvements over time, but they mainly reflect the formalization of community schools
and would not be directly attributable to the project. The pass rate in all schools for
pupils (both boys and girls) who took the examination increased from 23.3 percent in
1997 to 50 percent in 2004, and it dropped again to 44 percent in 2006. Scores at the JCE
at the end of form 2 (grade 10) tend to be higher, with a total average of 62 percent in
2006 (Table 4-3:).

4.17 Prior knowledge is necessary for retaining the information provided to secondary-
education students. Only 22 percent of Grade 6 students demonstrated minimum literacy
in 2002, and about 15 percent graduate illiterate (Figure 4-5:; Ellis 2003).17 Some of the
17
   A longitudinal study that used curriculum-based achievement tests to assess performance in English,
Chichewa, and mathematics of a sample of standards 2, 3, 4, and 5 pupils, found that a majority of children
entered subsequent grades without mastering the prerequisite literacy and numeracy skills that would
enable them to cope with the work in the higher standard. Over 50 percent of the pupils in standard 3 could
                                                                                           17


students assessed attended secondary education during the project period. To assess the
issues better, the IEG mission visited three rural primary schools. A convenience sample
of 12 students in grades 1-8 were asked to read in Chichewa and English and to explain
what they had read. The students who were interviewed could barely read in Chichewa
in grade 3 and could read fluently in grades 4-6, but they had limited English vocabulary
in grades 6-8 and could not express themselves. Thus they were unlikely to understand
much of the English-language texts they read in secondary schools.

4.18 Textbooks unavailable to students. The IEG mission verified that due to high
cost and dependence on purchase decisions at the individual school level, the schools had
fewer textbooks than students. Students' access to textbooks in 2009 was limited to
library copies. The mission asked every schoolmaster about the expense priorities of the
school and invariably heard concerns about infrastructure and equipment (e.g. burned
computer power supplies and kitchen equipment). None of the interviewed headmasters
mentioned textbook acquisition as a priority. When asked, however, all mentioned that
textbooks were simply too expensive to acquire them for all students. Their revolving
fund was too small, and though schools have been allowed to use 30 percent of tuition for
textbooks, they rarely bought textbooks. Textbooks have been optional, while building
maintenance and construction of teacher housing are considered necessary. Many
teachers themselves went to school without textbooks, and many members of
management committees that make spending decisions are illiterate. Thus, holding
classes without textbooks may be seen as normal.

4.19 As a result of textbook scarcity, the most frequent task in all classrooms visited
was transcription. Teachers spent most classroom time copying on the blackboard the
textbook contents for students to recopy. Without systematic reading, students' reading


not read the Chichewa and English text taken from standard 2 textbooks, and less than 30 percent of the
standard 3 pupils had mastered basic mathematics skills (Chilora 2001; Jere 2001). The most recent
achievement study documents similar findings, with more than 50 percent of pupils at nonmastery levels,
particularly in English and mathematics (Kishindo et al. 2004 in World Bank-UNICEF 2009).
                                                  18


speed does not rise, and they become unable to consult multiple sources in secondary
education, as they are expected to do (for a review see Abadzi 2008). Thus, many
reference books acquired for conventional schools through project funds lie unused.
Given the chronic limitations to textbook exposure, a vicious circle is created.

school                                             secondary school




In some schools, books may lie unused to ensure    Community schools have few textbooks and no
that they remain in good condition                 means to produce notes for students

4.20 Secondary curricula are complex and cannot be covered merely in classrooms.
For example, Malawian senior secondary students mainly rely on their copied notes to
study mathematics, which in other countries is the topic of extensive textbooks and
exercise books. In class students practice calligraphy rather than solve math problems.
Furthermore, it is impossible under such conditions to finish the prescribed annual
curricula in math and other subjects. Inevitably classes fall behind, and curricula must be
adjusted. For example, in grade 10 (Form 2), by the middle of the year only 76 of the 200
textbook pages had been covered. Thus, lack of textbooks would inevitably distort the
entire system. The IEG mission inquired about the effects of book scarcity on the need
for curricular revisions, but was told that the Malawi Institute of Education does not
conduct systematic classroom observations and relies on workshops with teachers.

4.21 Teacher absenteeism. The IEG mission observed extensive teacher absenteeism,
particularly near urban areas, where teachers may have other opportunities. Also, in
some occasions teachers were in the school but not in class ­ and the headmaster was not
monitoring instructional time use. Teachers who were interviewed often mentioned the
fatiguing effects associated with incessant copying and erasing texts as well as the little
amount of subject matter covered through this transmission mode. Research would be
needed to establish the effects of copying on student and teacher likelihood to attend
school. A Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS) conducted during the project
period in 2004 estimated teacher absenteeism at 20 percent on any given day, which
would mean an estimated average volume of annual instructional time of only 577 hours.
In addition, late entry, strikes, and casual holidays decrease teaching time. The
government has not taken clear actions on the PETS results.

4.22 As a result of distortions brought about by textbook scarcity and absenteeism the
educational system suffers from a severe restriction of knowledge (Annex Table C-5).
Average dropout in the four years of secondary schools was about 8 percent, and
repetition was 6.7 percent in 2006, but the internal efficiency coefficient for secondary
schools was reduced from 76 percent in 1999 to 66 percent in 2006 (Annex Table C-6).
The poor standards in the country's schools have meant that secondary schools are unable
to produce enough entrants for medical, nursing and midwifery programs due, among
other factors, to weak science and math education (MMoHP, 2002b). Training
institutions are running below capacity for some courses because of a lack of suitably
qualified entrants (McCoy 2003), and the secondary education project did not seem to
have significantly improved these conditions.

Objective (c): improve efficiency and effectiveness of the secondary
education system by strengthening school-based management (Modest)
4.23 The project exceeded training targets of 568; about 724 principals received
training (Annex Table A-1). The ICR reports that training enabled district-level
managers to increase their capacity to prepare, conduct and monitor training for school-
level principals. Project files show that trainees took paper-and-pencil tests and had on
average 10 percentage points of improvement between pretest and posttest. Some of the
headmasters interviewed by the mission found the course useful, notably the regulatory
and financial management aspects. The management courses continued to be offered after
the end of the project.

4.24 However, there was a consensus among MOE officials and donor staff who were
interviewed by the IEG mission that the courses were too general and did not provide
information in sufficient depth. There was also a concern that the persons who taught the
courses were not sufficiently knowledgeable to provide useful insights to the trainees.
The limited attention given by administrators to teacher presence in the classroom and to
improvement of classroom time use suggests that administrators may have learned little
about improving quality of education.

Objective (d): Stem the spread of HIV/AIDS among teachers and
students, through provision of training materials (Negligible)
4.25 AIDS booklets were to be the only project input to the community day secondary
schools (or distance education centers according to the PAD). According to the ICR
180,000 books were provided, and some donor staff report having seen the text.
However, a former director of the National AIDS commission did not recall having seen
these materials, and neither did the staff of schools who were interviewed. The IEG
mission could not get copies. So, it is unclear which HIV/AIDS materials were provided
through this project and in what form.

4.26 The project did not involve any linkages with other donors or institutions
investing in AIDS prevention in Malawi, and it is unclear how these materials interfaced
with other efforts. The effectiveness of the materials in bringing about behavior change
was not evaluated. There is no evidence regarding the utility or impact on protecting
teachers and students against the effects of AIDS. There was nothing to show that these
inputs did anything to stem the spread of HIV/AIDS in the country. Instead, HIV/AIDS
infections at national level seem to be increasing rather than decreasing. Life skills books
do discuss this health issue extensively, often with cartoons and lurid examples, and it is
possible that they were designed on the basis of the 2001 AIDS workshop and materials.
However, as mentioned above, students do not regularly read textbooks.

Objective (e) strengthen project implementation capacity, through
technical assistance in procurement and financial management (modest)
4.27 Extensive training was provided to project implementation unit staff, but the
training did not prevent weak financial management and long periods of inactivity. The
project implementation unit repeatedly lost trained financial officers, accountants, and
procurement experts to turnover. Audit reports for the project were submitted, but they
highlighted deficiencies in procurement and financial management.

4.28 As a result of weaknesses, the government replaced all project staff in 2000.
After replacement, the educational projects management unit became more functional
and was able to implement the follow-on project, which touched on all sectors and was
larger in scope.

Objective (f) support the Ministry of Education's policy to encourage
provision of private secondary education (Modest)
4.29 According to project documents, a consultant assisted in formulating suitable
guidelines to register private schools in the MOE and prepared recommendations for
formal working arrangements between the Ministry and the Private Schools Association
of Malawi. However, the mission could not find any reports, and the officials
interviewed did not recall receiving substantive inputs. Following the end of the project,
private sector representatives have been invited to participate in planning events, so some
working arrangements have been formalized.

      5. Ratings of the Secondary Education Project
Project Outcomes
5.1     Project objectives were highly relevant to the needs of the country, given the need
for large increases in the provision of secondary education. The relevance of the design is
rated modest (para. 2.3). Overall, relevance is rated substantial.

5.2     Project efficacy is rated modest. Despite serious implementation difficulties, the
project increased the availability of school infrastructure and obtained necessary inputs,
such as textbooks and essential training that would enable school operations. Ultimately,
most project activities were carried out, and most numerical targets were met. Overall
student-teacher ratios remained low, an indication that teacher deployment and
management was weak. Furthermore, textbooks were not sustainable, and it is likely that
the project has not improved the quality of education in the long run. It is unclear if the
project provided AIDS education effectively, because no evaluation was conducted.
Also, no private education study was found. (See Annex Table A-2 for detailed results
chain.) Overall, the number of graduating students increased by about 41 percent, from
28,886 in 1997 to 40,586 in 2004. However, increases cannot be fully attributed to the
project; due to changes in the designation of secondary education, most students do not
attend beneficiary schools.

5.3     Project efficiency is rated modest. The implementation of civil works was
delayed, and in some areas workmanship was poor, reducing the efficiency of the
building efforts. Unit costs were not available at various points in the project to
determine whether goods procured through this project compared favorably with others.
Additional efficiency-related data on project implementation are also limited. Cost
inefficiencies were caused by the poor quality and delays of civil works, delays in the
supply of instructional materials, and delays in procurement processing. Given the ratings
                                            22


of substantial relevance, modest efficacy, and modest efficiency, project outcome is rated
moderately unsatisfactory.

Risk to Development Outcome
5.4     Risk to development outcome is rated significant. Demand from students has
increased since the project was completed, and students able to pay the necessary fees are
gradually filling many schools to capacity. However, the sustainability of inputs is not
ensured. The textbooks proved not to be sustainable, so instructional efficiency has been
compromised, along with learning and subsequent labor outcomes. The modest school
construction quality has created maintenance needs earlier than expected. This means that
schools face significant repair and maintenance expenditures, which take precedence over
textbook acquisition. A continuing problem is vandalism of school grounds, which has
forced schools to spend money for fences and guards. The scarcity of qualified teachers
exacerbates risks to development outcomes.

Bank Performance
5.5     Quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory; the need for hardware inputs and
the importance of financial sustainability were correctly identified as policy priorities.
Also some targets and monitoring indicators were included in the PAD. Nevertheless,
the appraisal documents show limited insight regarding the amount of information
students were learning in class and their limited English language skills. Though the
limited instructional time was included as an issue in the PAD, there was no
measurement of it or plans for improving it. The Bank did not sufficiently identify the
governance risks and implementation limitations of the government in carrying out the
planned work. The documents do not refer to environmental assessments related to
school construction or to poverty assessments that might elucidate the extent to which the
very poor would be served by a secondary project.

5.6     Quality of supervision is rated moderately satisfactory. The project changed five
task managers, and the lack of continuity may have hurt the pace of implementation,
particularly given the lack of continuity among government officials (see next section).
Implementation proved challenging to Bank staff, who struggled to keep the project in
progress despite government limitations. Some difficult decisions had to be made, for
example on the employment of marginal performers in the project implementation unit.

5.7     The donor and government staff interviewed by the IEG mission expressed a high
regard for the Bank's financial management policies and interest in efficient civil works
construction. They also stated that specialist consultants who visited the country on
supervision missions were knowledgeable and satisfactorily discussed the state of various
components. A concern was expressed, however, that the Bank mainly focused on
implementation logistics and paid little attention to the effects of education. Overall,
Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory.
                                             23


Borrower Performance
5.8     Overall, Borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory. Government performance
is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Initially the government demonstrated commitment to
secondary education through the design and implementation of the project. The
government also developed a plan for secondary education that has remained under
implementation. Subsequent governments, however, offered limited leadership and
attention. Steering committees met rarely, and MOE had little guidance to provide.
Multiple ministers and permanent Secretaries were changed during the project.
Counterpart funding was often unavailable.

5.9     Implementing agency performance is rated unsatisfactory. The project
implementation unit failed to supervise the private contractors building civil works, and
thefts of materials occurred along with incidences of school vandalism. The
implementing agency hired private consultants to supervise the works but did not
supervise the consultants, so it did not detect early on the substandard materials that some
contractors were using. In 2000 the MOE dismissed the project implementation unit for
poor performance and hired new team that pushed the project forward. Also MOE staff
were seconded to the project implementation unit to ensure adequate linkage with the
Ministry. However, considerable time had been lost in the process.

Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation, and Utilization
5.10 Monitoring and evaluation design is rated modest. The project was appraised
before monitoring indicators were required in the Bank, so limited baseline data for
monitoring and evaluation were collected before project initiation. A monitoring and
evaluation system that would be used to monitor progress and outcome of the project was
retrofitted after 2002. Essential information was missing, and baseline data had been
poorly estimated on project effectiveness. Thus, project documents do not show the
development of an evaluation design to establish cause-effect relationships, and no
systematic means was put in place for data collection during the project.

5.11 Evaluation implementation and utilization are also rated modest. A monitoring
committee was established in the PIU, but meetings were irregular (ICR p. 11), and
monitoring was weak. For example, data on HIV infections were unavailable. The
Ministry's Management Information System improved in 2004-5 following donor
technical assistance (notably USAID), but the lack of reliable baselines in earlier years
hampers estimation of numerical project effects. These limitations have caused
difficulties in assessing implementation progress and outcomes of the project. Overall,
monitoring and evaluation are rated modest.

     6. Issues: An educational system with a very
     restricted knowledge base
6.1     The donors and government are preparing a sector-wide approach (SWAp) as the
next instrument of support for Malawian education. Below are some policy issues that
this operation could consider.

6.2      The efforts of the government to expand secondary education have been
conducted within a system that makes very little knowledge available to students.
Students attending secondary schools, universities, and teachers' colleges go through
their studies without structured and available sources of knowledge. If an educational
institution is run without textbooks, class time has to be spent in transcription. There is
not enough time to cover the curriculum or to contemplate its contents in class. Optional
readings in libraries are likely to be carried out mainly by the few better students.
Furthermore, students cannot consult multiple texts and authors when they barely can
read and have insufficient vocabulary; just reading a page may take five minutes, and
short-term memory is overwhelmed by the volume of slowly processed words.

6.3     As a result, a number of secondary students in Malawi (as in other sub-Saharan
Africa countries) read at third-grade level and may be unable to learn material from
complex secondary-level textbooks. Many teachers reportedly also have limited
knowledge and may give insufficient explanations. Because knowledge is cumulative
and instructional time is poorly used, students may learn little additional material in
school. Learning outcomes may be minimal, and certificates may have mainly social
value rather than attest to preparation for higher-level work

6.4    Sustainable textbooks at all levels. Educational institutions must have ample
sources of information, and since computers are not broadly available, textbooks must be
acquired. The provision of feasible and affordable sources of information must drive the
design and supervision of future lending. The IEG mission heard from headmasters and
publishers alike that textbooks are simply too expensive to procure; textbooks in Malawi
may cost US$10-20 each, whereas comparable textbooks in east Asia or Latin America
may only cost US$2-5. The reasons for price disparities are unclear. Nevertheless,
schools have proved their ability to manage textbook rental schemes, and if affordable
textbooks became available, the schools would obtain them.

6.5     Overall, concerted efforts should be undertaken to obtain English-language
textbooks at affordable prices for all levels through rentals, cheap international editions,
and potentially local printing. Up-to-date textbooks of broad international circulation are
likely to have material organized in ways that students understand and retain. Efforts to
acquire affordable textbooks could be expanded to teacher training colleges and the
university. For example, a nonprofit subsidiary could be set up to manage textbook
rentals at the university. Malawi is fortunate because students learn English in school,
although many may have poor command of the language. It would be advisable to
conduct a study similar to an expenditure tracking survey and find out what factors result
in price increases at various levels of the procurement process. Also, a consultation
conference could be held on textbook availability for all levels with local and
                                            25


international publishers as well as with authorities from the MOE, universities, and
private schools.

6.6      Improvement of reading skills and time use in primary school should result in
improved performance in secondary schools. Investment and supervision are needed for
grades 1-2 at least, where students are numerous, lack preschool experience, and learn
little. The possibility would be considered of hiring additional (and better teachers) for
these two grades and dividing students so that literacy can be better managed. Grants to
schools could pay for advanced primary or secondary students to tutor the young ones in
basic skills for a small fee, so that fluency can be acquired early.


      7. Lessons
7.1    This assessment provides a number of lessons for the education sector:

  Civil works have procurement issues that may exceed the supervisory capacity of the
  implementing units in low-income countries. Private-sector contractors may be able to
  execute civil works, but a lack of supervision may result in fraud, vandalism, and
  poor-quality buildings. The complexities of civil-works procurement may become the
  focus of education projects at the expense of learning issues. Governments should
  make efforts to employ staff with continuity and expertise that would ensure efficient
  execution of civil works and allow managers time to focus on learning-related
  improvements.

  Textbooks or systematically reproduced materials are a prerequisite for knowledge
  management at all levels of education. Their sustained availability should be a policy
  priority, particularly in countries where they are expensive. Without textbooks and
  training of teachers in their use, class time is spent in transcription; knowledge
  becomes constricted and systemic efficiency is low. Because of their crucial role,
  decisions on textbook purchases might best not be left to the discretion and financial
  strength of individual schools. A national strategy of sustainable and affordable
  secondary education textbooks is needed in low-income countries.

  Often projects provide inputs to educational institutions and expect improved learning
  outcomes as a result of these. To help students process information and retain it,
  however, instructionally oriented interventions are needed. Project designs lacking
  specific elements for improving the learning conditions of schools may not obtain the
  needed learning and subsequent educational outcomes.

  Large-scale curricular reforms will only have a positive effect if curricula are
  realistically implementable in classrooms. The Bank should be more proactive in
  advising governments on realistic curricular structures. Since curricular revisions often
  necessitate new textbooks, it is important to ensure that there is sufficient rationale for
  the revisions.

Project Activities

The follow-on project mainly centered on primary education. The Education Sector
Policy Framework and other policy documents outlined the specific policy targets for the
sector until 2012. The framework addressed both the need for improving the quality of
basic education and the need to improve quality and access to post-primary levels. For
basic education, the focus was on providing a sufficient supply of qualified teachers and
essential teaching and learning resources to achieve improved learning outcomes and
reduce dropout and repetition rates. At post-primary levels, the objective was to produce
more graduates in order to provide the number of teachers required at other levels o f the
education system and to meet the demand for qualified labor from other sectors o f the
economy (PAD 2005). Indicators included:

       improving the student-teacher ratio in Standards 1-8 from 123:l in 2000 to a
       maximum of 80 by closing date (67:l by 2012);
       In community day secondary schools, the student-teacher ratio was to improve
       from 102:l in 2000 to a maximum of 65:l by closing date (58:l by 2012)
       Effective school health and nutrition intervention to at least 80 percent of primary
       school pupils under the age of 10 by closing date (none to secondary students)
       Direct support to schools grants would be provided to primary schools: (a) within
       the first quarter of the school calendar year to some primary schools by March 3 1
       , 2007; and (b) to at least 2,000 primary schools by closing date. (Most secondary
       schools receive a budget ranging according to IEG mission estimates, from 11m
       kwacha to 0.5 m kwacha).
       A few selected dilapidated conventional secondary schools would be rehabilitated
       on the condition of piloting new financing and management interventions.

Overall, the project provided few additional investments on secondary education. There
has been expansion of the education faculty in Chancellor College, notably with
professors' offices. Four secondary schools have also gotten rehabilitated. However, the
cost of construction by far exceeded appraisal estimates, so much less work has been
done than was planned.

   Internal efficiency coefficient ratio between the number of pupil-years theoretically required to produce the
number of pupils reaching grade 6 (without counting repeaters) in a system without repetition or dropout and
the actual number of pupil-years spent to produce the same number of pupils, expressed in percentage. This
coefficient ranges theoretically between 0 (school system where no child reaches grade 6) and 1 (system
without repetition or drop-out).
