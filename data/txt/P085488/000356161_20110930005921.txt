                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY
1. This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors for a level one
   restructuring to the Nicaragua/Honduras Corazón Transboundary Biosphere Reserve
   Project P085488, GEF TF Grant No. 056599 and the accompanying amendments to
   the Project’s legal documents. The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to
   improve the national and binational management of the area of the proposed Corazón
   Transboundary Biosphere Reserve (CTBR), respecting the rights of traditional
   populations. A recent Mid-Term Review concluded that the Project is not likely to
   achieve the binational management focus of the PDO, and therefore a level one
   restructuring is required to modify the PDO. The following sections briefly
   summarize the Project objectives, the challenges that exist in meeting those
   objectives, the motivation for restructuring and the additional risks involved. A short
   summary of Project status and the proposed modifications are also included.
2. Global Environmental Objective (GEO) - The Project’s GEO is the conservation of
   the globally critical biodiversity of the Corazón Reserve, the largest and most
   important remaining area of natural habitat in Central America, through more
   effective protection, and improved, sustainable use of natural resources within the
   project area. Given that the Reserve lies along the border between Nicaragua and
   Honduras, and that there is a continuity of ecosystems and populations across the
   region, a promising element of the Project’s original design was a binational approach
   that aimed at promoting a better coordinated, more consistent and thus more effective
   management and conservation of cross-boundary natural resources. Although the
   complexity and inherent risks of this approach were deemed high at appraisal, the
   potential benefits were correspondingly higher.
3. Project Development Objective (PDO) - The PDO is to improve the national and
   binational management of the area of the proposed Corazón Transboundary
   Biosphere Reserve (CTBR), respecting the rights of traditional populations. The
   Project’s recent mid-term review (MTR), conducted in October 2010 concluded that
   the Project has significantly contributed to improving the management effectiveness
   in the area of the CTBR in both countries. Conclusive evidence was found that the
   Project is supporting national efforts to improve the management of the Reserve, and
   furthermore that it is contributing to the conservation of this global resource,
   consistent with the GEO. However, in terms of binational, coordinated management
   efforts, the MTR concluded that the Project will likely not achieve its original PDO.
4. Challenges in achieving PDO - This situation results from a combination of the
   following factors:
       a. Project design - The original Project design was complex and overly
          ambitious. The Project is a two-country initiative, which includes six
          components, 17 sub-components and 52 individual activities. The scope of
          these components includes topics as complex and diverse as: (i) institutional
                                            1
          strengthening at the national and provincial levels, involving autonomous
          regions in Nicaragua and indigenous territories in Honduras; (ii) support to
          government titling programs in indigenous areas of the CTBR; (iii)
          establishment of environment conservation funds in each country for the
          sustainable, long-term management of the Reserve; and (iv) financing (with
          roughly half of the grant) community-driven efforts towards participatory
          management of protected areas and natural resources in the CTBR. Adding to
          this thematic complexity, the scope in terms of target area of the Project is
          roughly 20,000 km2 and 14,000 km2 in Nicaragua and Honduras, respectively,
          in very remote areas with very limited access, where implementation and
          monitoring of activities is difficult (e.g. some of the target areas are so remote
          that access during the rainy season is only possible via helicopter). The
          implementation of a single-country project under these circumstances, and
          involving such diverse ethnic and political groups is a challenge in itself, and
          it is therefore not surprising that in this context, both Honduras and Nicaragua
          focused primarily in addressing their national agendas.
    Political context - Strained political relations between Honduras and Nicaragua
   following the removal of the Honduran President in June 2009 had a significant
impact on the Project. Diplomatic tensions between the two countries resulted in major
       setbacks to all activities with a binational scope. As a result, inter-country
  coordination has been complicated to date, and it is currently not possible to predict
whether an improvement in the situation can be expected before the closing date of the
 Project. It is important to note that some progress has been made recently in terms of
 coordination of activities and transfer of experiences between the two countries at the
                                       technical level.
       b. Capacity of executing agencies – The experience and the capacity of
          MARENA and SERNA to implement a highly complex Project were rated
          low at appraisal, but corresponding efforts to strengthen this capacity were not
          built into the Project design. The capacity of both agencies has improved.
          Strong, technical teams are in place in both countries and the administrative
          framework is in place. Evidence of this is clear from the improvement in the
          performance over the past year. However, the delays caused by more than two
          years of insufficient capacity in MARENA and more than three years in
          SERNA have negatively impacted the Project’s results to date and the ability
          to achieve its various objectives.
       c. Role of CCAD – Adding to the level of coordination complexity of the Project,
          the recipient of the Grant is the Comisión Centroamericana para el Ambiente
          y el Desarrollo (CCAD). The mandate and the strong political position of the
          CCAD in the region were considered in the design of the Project, and the
          agency was given the mandate to lead all coordination efforts between the two
          countries, including the presentation of the CTBR as a Biosphere Reserve to
          UNESCO. However, the role of CCAD, particularly during the first three
          years of Project implementation was primarily administrative, and little was
          done in terms of policy dialogue at a high political level.
5. Project’s historical performance – The Project has been under implementation
   since 2006. Its implementation was rated satisfactory in early 2007, moderately
                                            2
    unsatisfactory by the end of 2007 and unsatisfactory in December 2008. The Project
    has maintained an unsatisfactory rating until today.
6. Restructuring proposal - Given the difficulties experienced with implementation of
   this Project, and given results to date, approval is being requested for a level one
   restructuring, which would involve: (i) a change in the PDO that would eliminate
   binational commitments, which are not achievable under the current political climate
   and in the Project timeframe, while maintaining the overarching goal of preserving
   the cross-boundary Corazón Reserve; (ii) simplification of Project design to focus on
   activities and components that are progressing well and where results have been
   achieved; (iii) reallocation of funds, within original executing agency allocation, from
   non-performing components to those under which implementation mechanisms are
   functional, and where momentum to complete the proposed objectives has been built;
   and (iv) revision of the results framework and monitoring arrangements to better
   capture and monitor the impacts of the Project on conservation objectives of the
   CTBR. The restructuring proposal does not include an extension of the Project’s
   closing date.
7. Motivation for restructuring – In spite of the problems faced by the Project and of
   the limited time remaining until its closure, the Project has in fact made some
   important achievements, both in Nicaragua and in Honduras, which merit support
   until they are fully completed. There is strong commitment and good capacity at the
   level of the executing agencies to carry out activities under implementation to the end
   of the Project, and processes are in place that will make it possible to complete them
   by the closing date of the Project. Specifically:
         a. Significant results have been achieved - There is quantitative evidence1 to
            demonstrate that the Project has positively contributed to improving the
            management effectiveness of the CTBR, and thus that it is contributing to the
            preservation of the heart of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, the largest
            contiguous area of natural habitat remaining in Mesoamerica. A restructuring
            of the Project that involves simplification of its design to eliminate non-
            performing activities and focus on those where results are being achieved will
            support Nicaragua and Honduras in their efforts to conserve this globally
            critical Reserve;
         b. Remaining funding is considerable and can probably be disbursed before the
            closing date – As of December 31, the balance of funds remaining in
            Nicaragua was 57% and that in Honduras was 67%. This has since improved;
            as of July 31, 2011 the balance of funds remaining in Nicaragua was 40% and
            the estimated balance of funds remaining in Honduras will be 31% by the end
            of 2011. Notwithstanding the issues identified above that led to
            implementation delays, a significant amount of time was needed in each
            country to establish a framework that would allow the provision of funds to
            beneficiary communities in the Reserve, via subprojects that were identified,
            prepared, presented and approved through participatory mechanisms.
            Approximately two years were spent in awareness raising, consultations, and
            training. These mechanisms have been set up with full endorsement from the

1
 Through the use of the PROARCA and of the GEF tracking tools for measurement of management effectiveness
                                                      3
           communities, and they are currently functional. Roughly 150 sub-projects for
           participatory management of natural resources and protected areas have been
           approved (in total for both countries), and proposals are still being evaluated.
           Therefore, the latest assessments (e.g. mid-term review, supervision missions)
           indicate that, by reallocating resources consistent with the original objectives
           of the Project, there is a good likelihood of disbursing the majority of the
           funds by the closing date of the Project. In fact, as an indication of an upswing
           the pace of implementation, an increase of over 15% in cumulative project
           disbursements was achieved during the first semester of 2011;
       c. Primary beneficiaries of the Project are poor communities – An important co-
          benefit of the Project is its potential to improve the socio-economic conditions
          of poor communities in the target area of the Reserve, at least half of which
          are indigenous. A Project restructuring that focuses on components financing
          sub-projects would contribute to improving the livelihood of these remote
          communities, while promoting sustainable initiatives that support the
          conservation objectives of the Project.

B. PROJECT STATUS
8. Since the project became effective in November 2006, overall implementation has
   been slow. Disbursement levels only reached approximately 40% percent of the total
   budget as of December 31, 2010. However, implementation has since improved and
   total disbursement levels have increased to approximately 64% of the total budget as
   of June 30, 2011. The Project’s closing date is August 1, 2012. Implementation
   progress varies by component and by country. However, in general terms, activities
   are more advanced in Nicaragua than Honduras. The main results achieved under
   each component include:
          Component 1 – Consolidation of the Corazón Transboundary Reserve is
           currently progressing, however this component is significantly delayed given
           that very little progress was made on binational coordination arrangements for
           the project between June of 2009 and December of 2010 given the difficult
           political situation. Coordination has recently improved and the application to
           UNESCO for Biosphere Reserve status of the area is moving forward. In July,
           2011 participatory workshops were held in Honduras with local communities
           and indigenous peoples with the aim to raise awareness on the application to
           UNESCO. Similar workshops are planned to take place in Nicaragua in
           September, 2011.
           In Nicaragua, the Project has successfully contributed to Government titling
           programs in indigenous territories within the Reserve, supporting training,
           consultation and diagnostic activities. In Honduras, where land titling of
           indigenous communities by the Government is not as advanced, the Project
           has primarily supported coordination, and capacity building of representatives
           from indigenous Federations.
          Component 2 – Strengthening of the National Protected Areas System is
           underway in Honduras, where the Government has presented documentation
           to the Bank, in compliance with pre-conditions specified in the Grant

                                             4
                Agreement for the transfer of GEF resources to the National Protected Areas
                Fund2. This Fund is being set up as a sustainable source of resources for the
                management of protected areas in the CTBR. In Nicaragua, little progress has
                been achieved under this component, and only the conceptual design of a
                Protected Areas Fund has been completed. No financial commitment has yet
                been made by the Government towards this Fund.
               Component 3 – Implementation of Protected Area Management Plans is
                progressing in both countries. Significant delays relative to the original
                timetable for this component are partially due to the extensive consultations
                needed for each step of the process (terms of reference, proposal and
                implementation), which were not accounted for in the design. In Honduras,
                the update of the management plan for the Patuca National Park is underway,
                and terms of reference for the update of management plans of the Tawahka
                and Rio Platano National Parks have been approved by all stakeholders.
                Thirty six sub-projects that promote community participation in protected area
                co-management have been approved. In Nicaragua, the update of the
                management plan for the Bosawas Reserve will be completed by September
                2011, and 33 sub-projects promoting participative management of protected
                areas are under implementation. In both countries, evaluations of management
                effectiveness have been made every year since the beginning of the Project,
                and results show improvement as a result of Project-financed activities.
               Component 4 – Community-based Natural Resource Management is
                advancing well and both countries are on track to exceed original expected
                targets in terms of number of communities and individual families benefitting
                from sub-projects. Sixty four (64) proposals for community driven
                management of natural resources have been approved in Nicaragua and 29 in
                Honduras. Most of these sub-projects are expected to be completed before the
                end of 2011. In both countries, scholarships on natural resource management
                have been awarded to members of indigenous communities in the CTBR.
               Component 5 - Monitoring and Information Management is progressing well
                in Nicaragua, where socioeconomic and biological indicators for the CTBR
                have been integrated into the National Environmental Information System
                SINIA (a leading information network in Central America). In Honduras,
                progress under this component has been very slow, and a strategy for the
                establishment of an information system is only being discussed.
               Component 6 - Project Administration has not been satisfactory for the past
                two years, although new personnel in both countries have made a significant
                difference in recent months and both countries have committed to improving
                this performance.

   Results/indicators
    The MTR concluded that a major problem associated with the design of the Project
    involved the framework for monitoring and evaluation, including the monitoring
    arrangements presented in the PAD, which made it challenging to quantify the
    progress under the various components towards the global objectives of the Project.
    Accordingly, modifications are thus being proposed to the monitoring and evaluation
    matrix, summarized below and presented in detail in Annex 1 (Tables 1 and 2):
       i) Improved consistency between intermediate indicators and scope of
            components – Only six intermediate indicators were originally defined to
            monitor progress under the Project’s 17 sub-components. To correct for this
            situation, additional indicators have been defined, which adequately track the
            results achieved under the various activities financed by the Project;
      ii) Disaggregated indicators – The Project has been implemented differently in
            the two countries, with parts of the project advancing more than others
            depending on the specific component (e.g. Honduras’ progress under
            component 2 and Nicaragua’s progress under component 5, in both cases
            unmatched by the other country). However, the original indicators were
            defined in an aggregated basis, which made it difficult to report on individual
            progress relative to existing targets. In order to avoid future reporting of the
            lowest common achievement per component, which has resulted in under-
            reporting over the past three years, all the revised indicators proposed are
            disaggregated, with individual targets for each country;
     iii) Baselines – Baselines and annual targets included in the original monitoring
            matrix were estimated during Project preparation, and were expected to be
            confirmed/revised during the first year of implementation. This validation
            never took place. As a result, some of the current targets are excessively
            ambitious and/or indicators were never adequately defined to quantify
            progress towards those targets (e.g. increase in indigenous peoples’
            participation by 75% and decrease in deforestation rate of at least 25%). Some
            of the new, proposed baselines are being retroactively established based on
            existing data, and others have been set on the basis of the most current
            available information;
     iv) Establishment of monitoring framework for sub-projects – One of the most
            successful aspects of the Project, which are contributing to the global
            environmental indicators while promoting local development and sustainable
            natural resource management practices, are the participatory management sub-
            projects financed under components 3 and 4. The MTR showed the extent of
            the benefits achieved through these interventions, in both countries. A
            monitoring and evaluation framework for sub-projects has been defined and is
                                              6
           already in use to track the progress to date under these components, which has
           been only marginally documented to date;
     v)    Monitoring arrangements – No methodology was ever defined or
           implemented to collect, track, report, standardize, and/or compile monitoring
           data collected under the Project. No chain of responsibility or accountability
           was established. SERNA and MARENA have been collecting data, although
           mostly qualitative, and these were aggregated periodically without a pre-
           established methodology. A new methodology for data collection has been
           designed and agreed to by all parties, which will be used until Project closure.
           CCAD has been assigned the role of training, supervision and quality control,
           and they will be responsible for centralizing, standardizing and preparing
           reports for the Bank (one every six months);
    vi)    Budget for monitoring and evaluation – The original design of the Project did
           not include a budget line for monitoring and evaluation. The number and
           complexity of the financed activities, compounded with the remoteness and
           logistical difficulties associated with field supervision of sub-projects, require
           a significant amount of budget for monitoring and evaluation of results (for
           sub-projects and for global Project indicators), as is being proposed under the
           restructuring.

   Components
    Simplifications of the Project’s design are being proposed, in line with the
    recommendations of the MTR. Accordingly, budget reallocations are being proposed
    from under-performing components to those where quantifiable results have been
    achieved. These reallocations will not be the same for both countries. The proposed
    simplifications involve the following:
              i) Elimination of Component 1 – The overall objective of this
                   component, namely the consolidation of the CTBR, can no longer be
                   guaranteed under this Project, given the delay in binational
                   coordination on the project and the remaining time of execution. It is
                   thus proposed to relocate the original sub-components to other
                   components, as illustrated in Table 1;
             ii) Component 2 further focusing on strengthening of National Protected
                   Areas Systems – The original Component 2 will now be the new
                   Component 1 and will include two sub-components: (a) the first
                   focusing on updating and developing policy instruments for the
                   management of protected areas, including updates of management
                   plans for protected areas. This sub-component will also promote joint
                   binational coordination activities at a technical level, and will support
                   joint efforts to submit the application for Biosphere Reserve
                   certification to UNESCO; and (b) strengthening financial mechanisms,
                   i.e. endowment fund for protected areas, which is a reality in
                   Honduras, but will only entail the development of a strategy in
                   Nicaragua. Accordingly, most of the resources originally approved for
                   the creation of the Fund in Nicaragua will be reallocated to the new
                   component 2, where they will finance additional sub-projects;
                                             7
              iii)    Merging of components 3 and 4 – The original Components 3 and 4
                      will now be merged together in the new Component 2 which will focus
                      on: (a) implementation of sub-projects (without distinction between
                      protective area management and natural resource management); and
                      (b) local governance initiatives including scholarships, limited
                      research, knowledge management and support to the governments of
                      Nicaragua and Honduras on matters related to land regularization in
                      indigenous communities within the CTBR (still limited to capacity and
                      participatory building initiatives and excluding land titling activities);
              iv)     Component 5 – The original Component 5 is now the new Component
                      3 and will be reduced in scope in Honduras, where it will focus on the
                      development and dissemination of a strategy for the creation of a
                      national environmental information system. In Nicaragua, no budget
                      changes or changes in scope will be requested for the information
                      management sub-component. In both countries, the revised component
                      will include a new budget line for monitoring and evaluation of global
                      indicators.
               v)     Component 6 – The original Component 6 is now the new Component
                      4; the activities planned for this Component remains unchanged from
                      the original design.

        Other changes
           i) CCAD’s role - The overall role of the CCAD has been redefined as part of
                the restructuring. CCAD’s performance to date has not contributed to
                improving binational coordination, as originally expected. However, as a
                regional institution, CCAD has been maintained at the request of the
                governments of Nicaragua and Honduras. While its role will no longer be
                expected to support regional planning and coordination activities, it is
                expected to still play a useful role, drawing on the management capacity it
                has established. CCAD is expected to be responsible for managing its own
                activities on the project, including financial management and procurement,
                rather than managing political, project, and fiduciary activities in
                Nicaragua and Honduras. CCAD’s revised objectives, now include: (i)
                coordinating meetings and information exchanges between the Honduras
                and Nicaragua technical teams; (ii) processing the application to UNESCO
                for Biosphere Reserve Status; (iii) monitoring results from sub-project
                implementation and compiling overall global indicators; (iv) capacity
                building (i.e. providing training to field personnel and to sub-project
                beneficiaries on monitoring, co-financing training of local representatives
                under CCAD SICA training programs); (v) knowledge management (e.g.
                providing support with the publication and dissemination of manuals,
                research studies, management plans); and (vi) administrative/reporting
                responsibilities (e.g. compiling monitoring and financial reports). Clear
                                               12
                 performance indicators and accountability mechanisms have been
                 developed and built into the revised Project’s monitoring arrangements to
                 monitor CCAD’s future performance;
         ii)     Fiduciary responsibilities of executing agencies in Honduras and
                 Nicaragua – The Project’s Grant Agreement assigns CCAD the
                 responsibility for ensuring that executing agencies in Honduras and
                 Nicaragua follow the Bank’s fiduciary and procurement guidelines.
                 However, since the beginning of the project, both SERNA and MARENA
                 have taken the responsibility of applying the Bank’s guidelines, without
                 assistance from CCAD. Moreover, the Bank has been supervising and
                 holding SERNA and MARENA accountable for the use of its guidelines.
                 CCAD will compile, consolidate, review and present financial
                 management reports to the Bank. The Bank will continue to closely
                 monitor the fiduciary responsibilities and related performance of all
                 executing agencies.

            PROARCA Monitoring System

        At a 1997 workshop of Central American experts, the Regional Environmental Program for Central America (PROARCA, for its acronym in Spanish) developed a comprehensive
        methodology for measuring the management effectiveness of protected areas. Honduras developed its national version of this system in 2000; Nicaragua followed suit in 2001. The




                                                                                                  31
seven Central American countries have maintained common indicators and standards which allow them to contribute comparable data to the Central American Protected Areas System
(SICAP, also for its acronym in Spanish).

The PROARCA methodology involves the identification of objects to be conserved. Information is then compiled for indicators that measure how well each object is conserved, and a
final score category is assigned. Categories range from Poor to Very good.

                                                                 Indicator values           Category
                                                                 >=3.75                     Very Good
                                                                 3.0-3.74                   Good
                                                                 1.75-2.99                  Average
                                                                 <1.75                      Poor


Each evaluated protected area is then assigned a value from 1 to 5, based on a system that weights the different indicators.

A full description of the PROARCA methodology and rating system can be found at http://www.proarca.org/p_apm10.html.

As each country has adapted the PROARCA monitoring system for their own use, CCAD has developed an equivalency scale to compare the effectiveness ratings in both Nicaragua
and Honduras. This scale is shown below.

GEF Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT)

The METT tool was developed by the World Bank and the WWF to monitor progress in achieving goals for management effectiveness of protected areas. The tool is used to monitor
progress in implementing activities under the Biological Diversity Agreement and the Ramsar Agreement.

The tool consists of 30 questions, which one evaluates using a scoring system from poor (0) to excellent (3). The maximum score that can be obtained is 99, and is converted into a
percentage.

In December of 2010, the technical teams in Honduras and Nicaragua applied the METT to the four protected areas in the Corazón Project. These results were then compared with the
baseline data collected for METT in 2006. The results are shown below.
