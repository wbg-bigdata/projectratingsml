                         This ISR is being prepared after having completed supervision missions to Honduras and Nicaragua, and after having reviewed the consolidated matrix of indicators for the Project,
                         which finally captures actual results in both countries as per the Results Framework approved as part of the Level 1 restructuring of the project. The team is pleased to report
                         progress on all indicators, specifically:
Public Disclosure Copy




                            a) Disbursement levels doubled over the past year reaching almost 80 % as of today, and 100% of the funds are committed to ongoing activities.

                            b) Co-financing commitments have already been met in Honduras and will be met by Nicaragua when all the data are consolidated.

                             c) The monitoring matrix (attached to this ISR) shows that all of the revised Project targets will be met, and in fact, that the majority of them will be significantly exceeded. The
                         reason for this is not that the targets were underestimated at the time of the restructuring, but rather that, as was stated at the time, in spite of the issues, the countries had managed
                         to put in place frameworks to implement the key components (i.e. participative resource management and protected area management community subprojects), and that the
                         restructuring enabled them to move those components forward. Some of the most impressive indicators include: (i) over 5,000 hectares of deforested land currently undergoing
                         rehabilitation; (ii) 100 and 85 percent of the indigenous communities that live within the Corazon Reserve in HN and NI, respectively, benefiting directly from subprojects and training
                         provided by the Project; (iii) over 10,000 families living in the Reserve benefited from roughly 250 sub-projects in HN and NI; (iv) more than 30 percent of the beneficiaries are women;
                         (v) approximately 30 protective area management tools (e.g. manuals, measurement toolkits) developed, tested and mainstreamed in MARENA and SERNA; (vi) biodiversity
                         indicators and information management systems in place and under monitoring; (vii) capacity and accountability developed at the national level and across the Reserve, at the level
                         of the communities, to prepare projects, manage funds, and report results; and (viii) quantified economic benefits to sub-project beneficiaries from the productive systems established
                         through sub-projects.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         In light of the progress achieved and the meeting of all the agreed conditions, the TT is proposing to upgrade the rating of the project to Satisfactory.

                         This ISR is being drafted as the TT is preparing to request an extension of the closing date of the project, to December 15, 2012. The purpose of the extension is not to complete the
                         project financially, but rather to ensure that the results are adequately measured, and that the lessons learned are captured and disseminated. As per Annual Operation Plans
                         approved earlier this year, both countries are set up to complete all of their planned activities and to disburse practically all funds by the August closing date, in line with the
                         commitments made during the restructuring. However, doing so will involve a rushed closure of activities, which will not allow them to reflect on the final impacts, and to capture
                         results through the management effectiveness tools that were set up for the project.
