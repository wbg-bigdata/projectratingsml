F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The major development objectives of the project are to (i) strengthen and restructure selected research &
development institutions to achieve higher levels of applied research, while maintaining their scientific
excellence; and (ii) to increase the ability of enterprises to develop, use, adapt and commercialize
technology. This would contribute to improving the competitiveness of the Croatian industry both in the
domestic and foreign markets. An increased technological base and strengthened linkages between RDIs,
scientific community and industry will help enterprises compete more effectively and facilitate Croatia‟s
economic integration with the global markets. Moreover, upgrading the technological capabilities of firms
would be an important step for Croatia‟s access per se, but also in view of its EU accession.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The revised development objectives of the project are to (i) enable research and development institutions
to commercialize research outputs; and (ii) to increase the ability of enterprises, particularly small and
medium sized companies to invest in research and development activities (Project Paper July 2009).

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Croatia‟s scientific and innovative performance deteriorated significantly during the 1990s.
Public investments in R&D had substantially declined; a large number of scientists had moved
abroad; research infrastructure had deteriorated and the country‟s overall scientific performance
had worsened. Business R&D and the link between business and research organizations almost
disappeared with the privatization of large state owned enterprises in the manufacturing sector.
More broadly, Croatia lacked a coherent science and technology (S&T) policy and the
appropriate funding mechanisms to implement it. In 2003, the Government submitted its
application for EU membership and decided to prioritize R&D and innovation as sources of
competitiveness in order to fully benefit from economic integration with the EU. 1 By 2004,
Croatia indicated that it can accept the EU acquis on R&D and committed to adoption and
implementation by accession.2

The Science and Technology Project (STP) aimed to help Croatia establish and develop the
institutions and programs inherent to modern R&D and innovation systems. The rationale for
Bank involvement was well grounded in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) program for
FY05-09, which aimed to support the Government‟s growth and reform strategy for successful
EU accession. STP was therefore expected to support Croatia‟s innovation-driven growth and
competitiveness objectives.3 The Bank had been involved in a number of similar projects in the
ECA region, including Russia and Turkey, and in other middle-income countries such as Brazil.
The Bank‟s Operations Evaluation Department reviews concurred that the Bank had an
important role to play in the area of S&T given its previous experience in the field.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The original PDO was two-fold: (A) strengthening and restructuring selected R&D institutions to
promote applied research, while maintaining their scientific excellence; and (B) increasing the
ability of enterprises to develop, use, adapt and commercialize technology. Key outcome
indicators were:
(i)      Improved orientation of R&D towards industry needs, measured by number of joint
         projects of research and development institutes (RDIs) with industry;
(ii)     Increase in the self-sufficiency ratio of selected RDIs, measured by revenues earned from
         contractual research and services;
(iii)    Increase in the number of R&D projects commercialized (refined during implementation
         to measure the number of projects, not the percent);


1
  Several important strategic documents were developed in order to drive Croatia towards this direction, such as the “Croatian
Program for Innovative Technological Development? (2001), “Croatia in the Twenty-First Century-Science? (2003) and “Science
and Education Act? (2003).
2
  Due to its specificity, the EU acquis chapter on R&D did not require any transposition in national legislation, but rather
existence of appropriate R&D policy, capable institutions, and conditions for effective participation in EU Framework Programs.
3
  The contribution of the project to CAS objectives is explicitly presented in Chapter III of the CAS FY 05-09, in Table 5 on CAS
and EU Accession Agenda Synergies, as well as in Annex B3a and Annex B3b.


                                                               1
(iv)      Improved access to financing for R&D activities measured by the number and value of
          such financing provided;
(v)       Increase in firm-level productivity, market share, profitability, new products to market,
          and exports among beneficiary firms; and
(vi)      Increased collaboration between Croatian industry and research community with Croatian
          scientific Diaspora measured by number of joint ventures and applied research projects.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority), Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification4

The revised development objectives were to: (A) enable RDIs to commercialize research outputs;
and (B) increase the ability of enterprises, particularly SMEs, to invest in R&D activities.
Revised PDO, key indicators and targets aimed to reflect more accurately what could be
achieved with the funds available, given the prevailing institutional conditions in the country,
namely, limited appetite for RDI restructuring (as defined by the self-sufficiency indicator
targets) and a commitment to increased research capacity and commercialization results of
publicly-funded research that surpassed original expectations. In addition, the revised PDO
aimed to refine the objective of upgrading the technological capacity of SMEs by focusing on the
goal of increasing their private R&D capabilities (economic literature shows a close relationship
between firm investments in R&D and innovation and productivity growth). As a result:
      The corresponding key indicators (i) to (iii) described in the previous section were revised to
       reflect more relevant measures, key indicator (ii) was dropped since the objective of
       restructuring RDIs was removed, and key indicator (iv) was moved to a component indicator.
      The corresponding original key indicators (v) and (vi) were dropped and (vi) became a
       component indicator; two new key indicators were introduced to reflect the revised PDO (b),
       namely the percentage of SMEs that introduced new and improved products to the market
       and the volume of private R&D mobilized through the programs supported by the project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

Primary beneficiaries of the project were the Ministry of Science, Education and Sports (MSES);
public RDIs – namely Brodarski Institute Ltd 5 (BI) and Rudjer Boskovic Institute (RBI);
University of Zagreb, the largest in the country, and University Rijeka (both joining after the
start of the project). MSES benefited from development and implementation of innovation
programs by the Business Innovation Centre of Croatia (BICRO) – an agency focused on
promoting R&D in SMEs and fostering emergence of technology based start-ups – and from the
design and implementation of the Unity through Knowledge Fund (UKF) – a program supporting
cooperation between local researchers and Croatian researchers living abroad. Knowledge-based
SMEs and startups were direct project beneficiaries of programs run by BICRO. UKF programs
mainly targeted research groups from national and foreign R&D institutions, while encouraging
collaboration with the business sector through research contracts. By including RBI and
University of Zagreb, the project covered approximately 75 percent of research in the country.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)6

Component A: RDIs (EUR 11.5 million, of which EUR 10.5 million from the Loan). This
component aimed at assisting with restructuring of RDIs. Activity areas included governance and
strategic planning, human resources policies, business processes and information management,
upgrade of physical infrastructure, as well as commercialization and intellectual property
management. Subcomponents for at least two participating RDIs (BI and RBI) were envisaged.

Component B: BICRO (EUR 17.1 million, of which from the Loan EUR 14 million). The
component aimed to upgrade firms‟ technological capabilities by providing financing for
development, use and adaptation of new technologies, and improving quality of products,
ultimately contributing to the competitiveness of Croatian firms.

Component C: UKF (EUR 5 million of which EUR 3.7 million from the Loan). This component
was developed to attract Croatian scientists and researchers living abroad to nurture, cooperate
and contribute to the development of R&D activities in Croatia.

Component D: Project Implementation and National Innovation Support Group (EUR 1.8
million, of which EUR 1.64 million from the Loan).

1.6 Revised Components

The component objectives, activities and results indicators were revised as part of the
restructuring approved by the Board on July 9, 2009, as follows:

Component A (revised): Encouraging commercialization of publicly-funded research. The
objective was revised to foster commercialization of publicly funded research in place of
implementing RDI restructuring. Two other RDIs joined the project in 2009: the Technology
Transfer Office (TTO) of University of Zagreb and the TTO of University of Rijeka, with the
objective of commercializing parent universities‟ research results.

Component B (revised): R&D financing program for enterprises. This component was revised
to increase the ability of SMEs to invest in R&D activities, by implementing publicly supported
innovation-financing programs, with competent management and a transparent application
process. The result framework by project components was also revised as part of the July 2009
restructuring (details presented in Annex 2).

1.7 Other significant changes

Other changes resulting from the revised objectives and activities included funding reallocations;
cancellations of loan funds; and extension of the closing date. These changes were formally
approved at different stages in the period 2007-2011 (details on amendment documents included
in Annex 2). Key changes included: (i) savings from cancelling sub-component B (iii) (creation
of a venture capital fund) were reallocated to BICRO‟s programs – RAZUM and SPREAD (or

IRCRO) – and to UKF;7 (ii) the loan amount was reduced from EUR 31 million to EUR 30
million, by cancelling EUR 1 million from the venture capital category to support BI‟s
restructuring; and (iii) the project closing date was extended from November 30, 2009 to May 31,
2011 to allow full implementation of the envisaged project activities.

Additional changes were approved in the July 2009 project restructuring: a) cancellation of BI‟s
implementation covenant for maintaining an Institutional Renewal Account (IRA); 8 and (b)
cancellation of BI‟s sustainability clause (project agreement with BI, Article IV, Section 4.02a).
Amendments during project implementation and measures adopted to simplify Bank‟s sub-
financing approvals and procedures were also integrated to the project‟s legal documents.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project background analysis was sound in most aspects and was based on lessons from
international best practices.9 Envisaging a full range of interventions across the entire spectrum
of the Croatian innovation chain – including policy and institutional reforms, capacity building,
and innovation-financing programs management – STP was conceived as the backbone of the
Science and Technology Policy. In this regard, the ambitious and integrated project design was
appropriate for the many needs of the S&T sector in Croatia, and its complexity was to some
extent inevitable. The overall institutional and implementation arrangements, and the
procurement and financial management capacity, as envisaged in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD), was appropriate to the complexity of the project design. The project had been
correctly identified as a Substantial-Risk operation, with a number of risks identified in the PAD.
Some of them, originally identified as substantial or moderate, turned out to cause major
difficulties during implementation, while some of the proposed mitigation measures proved to be
futile (details provided in section 2.2 and section 5).

Aspects related to assessment of institutional quality at entry were too optimistic, however,
affecting project implementation. First, institutional and capacity building requirements inherent
to the project seem to have been underestimated. The adoption of a new Science and Technology
Policy, for instance, delayed the effectiveness of the project for about twelve months – as
stakeholder consultations proved longer than expected. Also, the level of capacity building
required of beneficiary agencies – BICRO, UKF and RI – was greater than originally conceived.
BICRO counted with a team of about five persons and a single program in the beginning – as
compared to about thirty people, at least four programs and a portfolio of beneficiaries that
increased tenfold at the end of the project. Fine-tuning the program manuals, having them

  A revised result for the UKF component (operational on a sustainable basis), was motivated by a highly satisfactory
performance of this component, though the restructuring did not envisage particular activities supporting this goal. With respect
to the introduced result for the National Innovation System (consolidation), it was meant to acknowledge in retrospect the
technical assistance provided to NIS over the life of the project.
8
  BI was required to set up an internal revolving fund account and to make quarterly replenishments from its revenues to the
account totaling EUR 1.5 million by 2010 (not done) and to use the amounts on deposit in said institutional renewal account for
the purpose of financing its institutional renewal requirements, under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.

  Most studies were funded by TAL 2 (Croatia Second Technical Assistance Loan). Annex 2 lists inputs for project preparation.


                                                               4
approved by government bodies, training personnel and developing the pipeline of applicants
took longer than originally expected. As a result, implementation of sub-financing components –
the BICRO and UKF programs – was delayed. There is no evidence that those circumstances
have affected project outcomes. Rather, as they started disbursing heavily after the initial years,
the programs received funds reallocated from underperforming components and ended the
project with larger than originally planned investment levels.

A factor affecting project implementation and outcomes is related to conditions to restructure
RDIs in Croatia. This was evident when RBI, the largest research institute in the country and the
second to be restructured, joined the project several months after its effectiveness and under a
limited goal of promoting commercialization. The limited support for restructuring BI became
evident when key restructuring milestones – related to cost reductions and revisions of human
resource and management policies – were systematically missed during the first years of
implementation. This, in turn, contrasted with a satisfactory performance in terms of diversifying
research areas (away from shipbuilding) and clients (towards private sector and international
research funds) for which project support was instrumental. 10 It did not help that the
Government‟s obligation to provide state budget support to BI to finance costs associated with its
Hydrodynamics Laboratory, an integral part of the restructuring program, and another project
covenant never materialized.11 Those circumstances affected one of the original PDOs (and thus
the outcome, namely restructuring RDIs).

2.2 Implementation

As the following pages will demonstrate, the project was implemented successfully (the overall
rating is satisfactory): despite the difficulties during the first phase of implementation, the project
achieved its objectives, with good results. There was a range of factors contributing to this
outcome, all of them indicating solid Government support to the project and to the broader R&D
and innovation policy agenda in Croatia, within the context of completing the EU accession
process. The global economic crisis forced the project to review one of its original components,
namely development of a venture capital fund, but did not affect is overall results.12

Despite fiscal constraints imposed by the global economic crisis and the related uncertainties, the
Government managed to provide sufficient fiscal space and counter-part funds for project
implementation. 13 It adopted policies and proposed laws and regulations, when necessary, to
support the PDO and specific project activities; improved policy framework conditions for
innovation (as reflected by a lessened tax base for R&D spending and harmonization of the
intellectual property (IP) regime with EU and international legislation). A new science law aimed


10
   This deficiency was identified in mid-term and 2009 Joint Portfolio reviews. After using more than half of its original
allocation, BI was lagging behind in achieving the self sustainability ratio needed for successful restructuring. Interestingly
enough, BI access to direct subsidy had been close to null and most of its revenues were obtained through a competitive process
or contract research. Yet, the institute had systematically showed slightly positive financial results. Meanwhile, RBI‟s interest in
joining STP was de facto limited to improving management and commercialization.

12
   The issue was addressed in the 2009 restructuring.
13
   The risk of insufficient counterpart funding required careful management of the Government‟s contribution, in order to avoid
major delays in BICRO‟s activities. Once the agreement was reached with the State Treasury on budget allocation adjustments at
the end of 2009, the issue of counterpart funding was resolved.


                                                                 5
at improving conditions for management of public research was publicly debated. In addition,
the Government appointed a capable and committed staff for the corresponding project agencies
and the Project Management Unit (PMU). Downsides in performance were manifested by
occasional fluctuations in attention to project issues, due to government reorganizations.

At implementing agency level, MSES adopted streamlined procedures to delegate responsibility
to agencies and reviewed project documents in the initial phase of the project. BICRO, for
instance, introduced a new program, the Proof of Concept, to better fit the needs of small scale
early-stage financing in the country – complementing the RAZUM and SPREAD programs
originally planned by the project. UKF‟s team successfully tailored the programs initially
conceived, adjusting them to local reality and to the need to foster integration to the European
Research Area (ERA) through higher participation rates in EU programs such as the Seventh
Framework Program (FP7), EU‟s main instrument for funding research. Both teams were
actively pursuing the development of a solid pipeline of project proposals by SMEs and
academic sectors and were fully committed to the establishment of transparent, meritocratic and
relatively simple selection processes, contributing to an increased number of potential applicants.
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) schemes were established at inception of those programs,
helping the management team to adjust their regulations based on timely feedback from
applicants (both institutions commissioned an independent assessment of their programs).

The global economic and financial crisis eliminated the chances of developing a local venture
capital fund. After several attempts to identify private investors willing to match the funds made
available by the project, it became clear that the global deleveraging of financial markets had
affected Croatia significantly with less liquidity available in the market and more risk-averse
investors. It also became clear that international investors were not willing to invest in the
country as venture funds, also affected by the global crisis, were concentrating resources in their
previous investments rather than considering options for expanding their portfolios.

2. 3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

Institutional arrangements for M&E were put in place during project preparation and were
appropriately carried out during implementation. The original results framework had clear
objectives, with all but one of the outcome indicators being realistically set. The results
framework had coherent linkages between outputs and outcomes, measurable indicators and
clear data collecting methods. Moreover, the results framework was incorporated in relevant
project documents, as required. MSES/PMU regularly provided reports on project
implementation, including updated information on outcome and output indicators.

Regular monitoring based on the M&E framework and risk assessment allowed the Government
and the Bank to take informed decisions during implementation, including on project
restructuring and reallocation of funds to better performing activities. The Government also used
the M&E framework for internal accountability purposes, such as reporting on progress made in
implementing the Science and Technology Policy as part of EU accession talks, and having
better insight of R&D programs and policy making. Most of the indicators were formally
introduced by the Government in the “Action Plan for increasing the level of investment in
research and development.? Finally, a first assessment of the BICRO and UKF programs and the



                                                6
existing tax-breaks for R&D activities was commissioned by the Government to the Zagreb
Institute of Economics.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

FM arrangements were rated Satisfactory during the project‟s life, with supervision missions
routinely monitoring fiduciary compliance and with annual audits performed by external auditors.
On one occasion, the rating was downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory due to delays in
submitting 2006 audit reports and poor result of BICRO‟s, BI‟s and RBI‟s financial statements.
The corrective measures recommended by the Bank were implemented in a timely fashion.

Although counterpart funding was mostly rated as moderately satisfactory, implementation was
not constrained, as the Government was taking corrective measures during the State Budget
rectification. In 2009, given the country‟s continuous fiscal constraints and following the request
of the Government, the Bank increased financing from the loan proceeds for the RAZUM
program, from EUR 3 million at appraisal to EUR 7.5 million as the final amount.

In regards to procurement, the PMU procurement staff benefitted from support of the Bank‟s
procurement specialist based in the field office, enhancing their knowledge of Bank procedures
and increasing overall capacity to support beneficiaries.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The lack of sustainability of the programs developed through STP has been and remains a major
issue for the project. The public innovation policies and programs developed under the project,
and the improved interaction between companies and research institutes in S&T are jeopardized
by the fiscal limitations and lack of flexibility of MSES to reallocate funds internally. In the
period 2014-2020, Croatia will have an annual amount of approximately EUR 150 million
available for R&D from EU Structural and Cohesion Funds, available upon EU accession.
Access to EU funds after 2013 could help mitigate the constraints to a sustained increase in
public R&D expenditures imposed by the country‟s fiscal consolidation needs.

In this context, the Government requested the Bank to prepare a follow-up project to STP, with
the primary objective to ensure a high absorption rate of EU funds, by strengthening the policy
and institutional frameworks and further consolidating the institutional project management
capacity. At the same time, to address the funding gap, the project would support firm-level
R&D for the period ahead of EU accession and prepare a pipeline of project proposals for the use
of EU funds.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project development objective remains highly relevant for Croatia‟s economic development
and is central to the Europe 2020 Strategy‟s Innovation Union flagship – one of the seven
flagships aimed at improving conditions and access to finance for R&D and innovation. A recent



                                                7
calculation estimates the social rate of return on R&D investments in Croatia to 73 percent –
more than twice, for instance, the rate of return for infrastructure.14 Yet Croatia‟s aggregate R&D
investments are at a relatively low level (0.9 percent of GDP in 2011, as compared to 3-5 percent
in innovation-driven economies such as Finland, Sweden and Israel). R&D and innovation
continues to hold the key to boosting productivity and securing long term development.

Project objectives are aligned with the objectives of the current CPS for FY09-FY12, particularly
with its second pillar of strengthened private sector led growth and accelerated EU convergence.
In response to country needs in view of EU accession, these objectives have been further
calibrated by the CPS Progress Report to gain more focus towards EU 2020 strategic objectives
and accelerate absorption of EU funds. 15 More broadly, the PDO is aligned with EU‟s
development priorities as articulated in the Europe 2020 Strategy and its “smart growth? pillar –
aimed at boosting EU‟s performance in R&D and innovation.

Project design was appropriate for achieving the development objectives: (i) a mix of
instruments to alleviate market failures and boost innovation was envisaged; (ii) different stages
of the innovation process (from basic and applied research to product development and
commercialization) were targeted; and (iii) partnership between business and academia and
collaboration between local scientists and Croatian Diaspora were encouraged. Meanwhile, the
national innovation policy supported by the project ensured coherence and integration of the
different STP components. The flexibility built into the project design proved to be beneficial in
balancing the different components and to respond to country needs. Through restructurings,
project funds were directed to project activities with most additionality benefits. Also, in
response to the fiscal constraints faced by the country, the financing ratio from the loan was
increased, particularly in the case of sub-financing categories (RAZUM).

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The project enabled R&D institutions to commercialize research outputs. It also increased the
ability of enterprises to develop, use and adapt technology by addressing and correcting the
market failures of programs focusing on R&D financing for enterprises (RAZUM and SPREAD).
The project also contributed to the higher-level objectives of increasing competiveness of
Croatian firms and integration with the EU. Competitiveness derives from the creation of
differentiated capabilities, created through innovation and needed to sustain growth. 16 The
project outcome indicators were met or exceeded in all but two cases (the number of concluded
spillovers and the value of licensing agreements where the performance was slightly lower than
the estimated target). Key achievements included: (i) more research outputs and research
capacity commercialized by RDIs; (ii) improved scientific and technological cooperation; and
(iii) more firms investing in R&D activities, as illustrated below by the following results:17

   A more detailed explanation of the project achievements for all of its four components are presented in Annex 2.


                                                            8
       69 new research contracts (target was 55) with industry were concluded by BI and UKF,
with a total value of EUR 10.9 million (against the target of EUR 9.8 million).
     Rudjer Innovations (RI) (RBI‟s TTO) established five spillover companies (two new
companies to be completed within the next 12-24 months). Total value of the five spillovers
amounts to EUR 3.1 million (target was EUR 2.9 million for eight spillovers).
      RI signed 12 licensing agreements (exceeding the target of eight agreements), including
with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Brown University, reaching about EUR
800,000 (falling short of the target EUR 1.0 million).
        UKF‟s cooperation program established collaboration with 133 foreign research
institutions including Mack-Planck Institute, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, and Johns
Hopkins University.
      Increased volume of private funding for R&D activities mobilized by firms: EUR 13.7
million, 30 percent higher than the initially envisaged target of EUR 9.2 million.18

3.3 Efficiency

The project is assessed to have achieved a high level of efficiency.

The PAD justified the efficiency of STP based on (i) results from developed countries showing
that the rate of return on R&D investments is around 20 percent, and (ii) the public good nature
of the intervention (but not automatically to the project). Cost-benefit analyses are however not
easily applicable to evaluating efficiency of the project for a number of reasons, most notably
due to the positive externalities related to R&D and the gap between social (economic) and
private rates of return – the latter measured by internal rates of return (IRR). IRR in the present
case would also be highly dependent on the values assigned to the results of commercialization
activities and to the intangible benefits related to capacity building.

In the absence of standard cost-benefit analysis, and following ICR Guidelines, project efficiency
is evaluated through estimates of (i) social opportunity costs and (ii) cost effectiveness. To
estimate social opportunity cost of R&D investments, we compare the rate of return on R&D
with other possible public investments in Croatia.19 Our findings show that the estimated rate of
return on R&D (73 percent) is at least twice the value for infrastructure and seven times higher
than for education. To assess the project‟s cost effectiveness (i.e. whether it represents the least-
cost solution to attain identified results), we consider whether the development objectives would
have been achieved without STP support (see Annex 3). 20

    Research Commercialization. It is unlikely that the observed volume of commercialization
     would have been achieved without the technical assistance and financing provided through
     STP to the TTOs and BI. SPREAD, in particular, subsidized collaboration between the public


18
   This amount reflects only the direct contribution of firms participating in the project programs (at least 30% of RAZUM
projects; at least 50% of SPREAD projects; 20% of UKF contracts).
19
   For practical reasons, we chose to limit the comparison to investments in education and infrastructure – the bulk of the projects
of the country‟s 2010 Economic Recovery Program (see Annex 3 for details).
20
   We consider the initiative to be a least-cost option if the results cannot be achieved otherwise.


                                                                 9
     and private sector. In a survey prepared by the Zagreb Institute of Economics (ZIE) SPREAD
     beneficiaries agreed on average that collaboration with academia would not exist without
     funding. Firms also believe that without such collaboration, it would have taken longer to
     achieve the same results, while the research scope would be significantly reduced. 21

    Business R&D spending. The ZIE survey also indicates that a large share of RAZUM-
     mobilized business R&D spending would not have occurred in the absence of the program.
     Smaller budgets would have resulted in longer duration and smaller scope of the activity,
     lower R&D capacity, and a lower innovativeness level. 22 Data also showed that R&D
     intensity increased after start of the RAZUM program in 9 out of 15 companies. RAZUM
     also generated new employment (54 new jobs), most of which has been in R&D (48 jobs).
     The companies expressed their intention to keep the new staff after the project is over, while
     more than half of the companies would have been unable to hire new staff for the project.

    Research Excellence. A similar result was achieved for UKF, where the survey indicated
     that absence of funding would have resulted in lower quality of scientific output; fewer
     papers published in top ranked journals; and more difficulties for researchers to cooperate
     with Croatian Diaspora and foreign scientists, as well as to educate young researchers abroad.
     Another important result that helps to understand the impact of UKF in terms of research
     excellence is that projects supported by UKF were twice as likely to obtain additional
     funding from FP7 as the average Croatian project application.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome of the project is Satisfactory based on a moderately satisfactory outcome
before the 2009 restructuring and a satisfactory outcome after restructuring.23 If assessed against
the original development objectives the project outcomes would have been rated moderately
satisfactory.24 However, the project restructuring that included the revision of the original PDOs
was done at an early stage with 37 percent of the loan funds disbursed, leaving enough space for
achievement of the new objectives. By project closing date, all but two of the project outcome
indicators (the number of spin-off companies and the value of licensing agreements with the
business sector) were met. The project objectives, design and implementation remained highly
relevant for the current country context.




21
   Before the project, the mindset of researchers was unfavorable to the concept of commercialization resources (financing and
knowledge) were not available. In the project period, there were no other similar activities being implemented in Croatia.
22
   While the “additionality effect? of public support to business R&D has been a topic of debate for the last decades, the more
rigorous evaluations of recent years have consistently found slightly positive (but significant) effects of public support to R&D
(see Andres, Luis, Borja C. and Correa P. (2012) “R&D Interventions: Where do we stand? A meta-analysis of impact evaluation
studies,? mimeo)
23
   Rating is weighted in proportion to the share of disbursement before and after restructuring, according to the "Joint Guidelines
for ICRs and IEG assessments" (Appendix B of ICR Guidelines).
24
   (i) Although the self sufficiency ratio of BI reached 95 percent by end project (instead of targeted 100 percent), this outcome is
still volatile as the institute needs further reductions of costs and a more stable revenue base. (ii) RBI did not join the project as
restructuring candidate and limited its participation to improved commercialization.


                                                                 10
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development                               NA

(b) Institutional Strengthening

The project had a substantial impact on institutional development across the science and
innovation system in Croatia, as indicated by such achievements as: (i) UKF selected as “Best
Practice? by the European Regional Economic Forum (EREF) on the topic ?Developing human
capital and managing migration for more competitive European regions;? (ii) UKF selected as
“Good Practice? by the International Labor Organization (ILO) on the topic “Promoting linkages
between migration and development;? (iii) BI and RI becoming members of EARTO and
participated in FP8 Task Force meetings; (iv) BI strengthening cooperation with the innovation
network PERA/iNET for preparation of projects to be financed from FP7; and (v) BICRO being
awarded “Development of Innovative Business Parks to Foster Innovation and Entrepreneurship
in the SEE Area,? and becoming member of the European Enterprise Network and the European
Business and Innovation Network.

 (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The project components were aligned with the Europe 2020 Innovation Union initiative and
contributed to the dialogue related to Croatia‟s EU integration. The average innovation
performance (AIP) indicator measures countries‟ progress towards the EU2020 Innovation
Union.25 Incremental changes of this indicator that could be attributable to the project cannot be
quantified at this stage given insufficient comparable data. However, a qualitative assessment
could be safely done as the project outcomes/outputs and the additionality benefits have an
impact on 20 of the 24 sub-indicators that compose the AIP (Table A.3.3 presented in Annex 3).
Overall, by meeting/exceeding its objectives, the project had impact on establishing and
improving the channels that lead to a more knowledge-based society.

Through the UKF program, the project supported participation in the EU Framework Programs
and ERA objectives. FP7 funds awarded to UKF projects represent 34 percent of all FP7 funds
attracted by Croatian scientists in 2007-2010, demonstrating high competitiveness of UKF-
supported research groups. In addition, UKF and MSES were invited in December 2011 to
negotiate a COFUND project within FP7 for fellowship, training and career development. The
project would help integrate Croatian scientists in ERA and foster incoming mobility to Croatia.

As part of the UKF “Across the Borders Program,? the project resulted in publication of 54
academic papers in journals and 73 papers in conference proceedings. Beneficiaries also
submitted 30 applications to the FP7 European research program and 19 applications to other
international research programs. They established long-term cooperation with Croatian Diaspora
scientists and with scientific/research institutions from abroad.



25
  The average performance is measured using a composite indicator building on data for 24 indicators going from a lowest
possible performance of 0 to a maximum possible performance of 1.


                                                          11
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

The risk to the development outcome is rated as Substantial given the probability of occurrence
and likely threats to the described outcomes. A first risk relates to the sustainability of key
institutions/programs since elections in December 2011. A second risk is the availability of
innovation financing mechanisms. As a mitigating factor, the Government has started to prepare
with the Bank a Second Science and Technology Project focused on preparing Croatia‟s R&D
and innovation sector to efficiently absorb EU funds expected to be available from July 2013.

The new Government is currently considering a merger of UKF with the National Science
Foundation – an option that could seriously affect the transparency and merit-based approach to
selection of scientific projects to be funded and thus the excellence of its research results, given
NSF‟s constraining regulations and governance structure. BICRO‟s transition from a private
liability company to a government agency, initiated by the previous administration and not yet
completed, is likely to have at least two negative implications: (i) salary cuts of up to 40 percent,
which create a severe risk of losing the cadre of highly trained professionals; and (ii) and a more
restrained capacity to manage multiyear budgets, which increases BICRO‟s dependence to the
budget cycle, contributing to the volatility of public financing for business R&D.

The availability of budgetary resources to existing BICRO early-stage financing programs
remains uncertain in the context of currently severe fiscal constraints, even though the MSES
2012 budget for R&D increased relative to 2011.26 Moreover, markets are unlikely to provide
angel/venture financing to the pipeline of innovation projects and technology-based startups that
were generated by STP – a rare pipeline of potentially viable projects as evaluated by
international experts (see the STP Aide Memoire of February 14-21, 2011). Developing a
venture capital industry remains a mid-term challenge for Croatia and resources of the Economic
Cooperation Funds program to support the equity industry are likely to trickle down, benefiting
technology based projects. The risk related to the existing funding gap has been recognized by
the European Investment Fund in the study “Western Balkans Venture Capital Market
Assessment? (Nov. 2010).27

The Second Science and Technology Project (STP II), currently under preparation as a follow-up
operation, aims to further strengthen Croatia‟s R&D sector in order to maximize absorption of
future EU funds, estimated at about EUR 150 million annually (2014-2020) – an amount
sufficient to efficiently address Croatia innovation financing needs in the near future. Among
other initiatives, STP II will assist the Government in adjusting current programs (BICRO and
UKF) to EU regulations and preparing submissions to EU Structural and Cohesion funds. In



26
   Planned MSES budget for R&D is KUN 687.5 million in 2012 (7.7% percent increase from 2012). Excluding technology, this
ratio, relative to 2011, is even higher (+10.6%). When adding planned spending on public institutes, the corresponding value is
KUN 968.2 million in 2012 (6.42 % increase from 2011).
27
   In the referred report, EIF conclude that: “(…) In Croatia, TT [technology transfer] financing is significantly developed
because of the World Bank sponsored Science and Technology Project (STP). Yet, TT financing is in pioneering stage with
potential to increase from current EUR 5 million per annum to EUR 20 million per annum in 2013-2014. The most serious lack
of TT funding is between STP end-date (May 2011) and the EU Accession. Current estimate of unsatisfied expressed demand is
between EUR 6-9 million, unexpressed demand is larger.? (p.7)


                                                             12
parallel, the Government and BICRO, under leadership of Croatia‟s Development Bank (HBOR)
are forcefully pursuing strategies to foster the creation of sound venture financing instruments.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The project was prepared with extensive consultations and stakeholder discussions and with
significant funding support from TAL 2. The project design was complex and was grounded on
both theoretical concepts derived from the relevant economic literature and on lessons from
international best practices. The project responded well to the Government‟s innovation led
growth strategy and to EU accession goals.

Significant efforts were made to ensure effective implementation arrangements, given the
number of agencies involved and diversity of instruments utilized. Important project documents
and frameworks were developed and efforts were made to strengthen the institutional capacity.
The Operational Manual, business plans of participating agencies, M&E frameworks, financial
management and procurement arrangements were thus developed and training courses for
procurement delivered. Although project readiness was achieved to a large extent, as it turned
out during the first years of implementation, incomplete project readiness and weak design
caused delays and affected timely achievement of PDOs. Despite the high risks and uncertainties
identified at project appraisal and negotiations, project objectives were not narrowed down, nor
were the problematic aspects of the project design addressed. Thus, some project design issues
which were not entirely resolved at preparation had to be addressed during implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank provided consistent and timely implementation support with regular missions and a
comprehensive mid-term review (MTR) mission in 2008. The Implementation Status Reports
(ISRs) were realistic and informative and addressed promptly the project‟s problems. The Aide
Memoires were regularly prepared and focused the Government and Project agencies‟ attention
to resolving project execution issues by suggesting remedies in a timely manner. Besides the
regular supervision mission, close contacts with project agencies were kept through frequent
communications and interactions with the local project officer and the decentralized procurement
and financial management specialists.

The appointment in 2007 of a new TTL and a local project officer in Zagreb gave new impetus to
project implementation and reinforced the focus on PDOs. Actions were taken by the new
project team to streamline project implementation and decentralize some of the project decisions
at local level. The MTR constituted the cornerstone for the satisfactory turnaround of project
implementation, by proactively addressing the structural weaknesses of the project. The
opportunistic project restructurings approved in 2010 and 2011 directed project funds towards



                                               13
activities with most additionality benefits. The Joint Portfolio Reviews of the Bank and the
Government were also instrumental in proactively signaling the project issues, particularly
during the first years of project implementation. Moreover, the Bank team provided technical
assistance to national policy issues in S&T, among others through input to the Science and
Technology Policy and the draft Science Act.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall Bank performance was moderately satisfactory due to shortcomings in project
preparation and appraisal, in spite of the satisfactory Bank performance during implementation
and the satisfactory outcome of the project. The flaws in design and weaknesses in project
preparation hindered smooth project implementation and jeopardized project outcomes. The
sustained efforts made during implementation led to partial recovery of the initial delays in
project implementation, while the proactive project restructuring allowed for satisfactory
achievement of the project outcomes.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Performance of the Government/MSES is rated moderately satisfactory, mainly due to weak
ownership during the first years of implementation. Commitment to S&T goals was reflected by
the adoption of strategic research policy documents, primarily the “Science and Technology
Policy 2006-2010,? the “Action Plan 2007-2010? and the “Action Plan for increasing the level of
investment in research and development,? but public consultations on these documents did delay
project effectiveness by twelve months. Other delays in the initial phases were related to
fluctuations in attention to project issues due to Government reorganizations and bureaucratic red
tape. Moreover, the risk of insufficient counterpart funding required careful management of the
Government‟s contribution in order to avoid major delays in BICRO programs. This risk was
addressed through an increase of the loan contribution for RAZUM and agreement with the state
treasury on adjustment of budget allocations to project needs.

In later project stages, MSES took the necessary actions for resolution of project implementation
issues, including: (i) adequate staffing throughout the project, with a well-performing PMU; (ii)
adoption of streamlined procedures to delegate project implementation responsibilities to project
agencies; (iii) timely revision/adoption of project documents, thus departing from the slow
performance in the initial phase; (iv) engagement in project coordination at state secretary level;
(v) readiness to foster commercialization by allocating funds to the TTOs of Universities of
Zagreb and Rijeka; and (vi) active participation in Joint Portfolio Reviews with the Ministry of
Finance. Meanwhile, MSES commitment to the revised project objectives led to timely execution
of the revised project schedule and disbursement of 60 percent of loan funds within 18 months.




                                                14
(b) Implementing Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

BICRO and BI were ready for implementation as they benefitted from TAL 2 financing for
training, equipment, and expert assistance. Once MSES had addressed the necessary legal
arrangements, the agencies engaged with full intensity and remained highly committed
throughout the project. The BICRO component has been rated moderately satisfactory for a
certain time given the slow start of its SPREAD program. This was addressed at mid-term with
adjustments that led to a high interest from the business sector and an increase in the program‟s
allocation. BICRO‟s proactive approach to fostering private R&D activities was demonstrated by
their development of the Proof of Concept program (within TechCro), which was a missing link
in the innovation financing chain. UKF performance was rated highly satisfactory throughout the
project. The Bank delegated management of funds to a small and highly efficient team of
executives and representatives of academia and private sector. UKF‟s good performance resulted
in international recognition of their practices by the ILO. The RBI subcomponent was delayed
due to the need to adjust project financing to go through RI (a newly established TTO) as well as
the time needed to identify a team with unique skills to foster technology transfer, which were
not readily available on the labor market. Upon setting the full team at RI, the activities picked
up and RI had its first spill-over companies established in line with annual project targets.
Though the views of BI for the restructuring goals varied throughout the project, its management
remained eager to continue the dialogue with the Bank until a set of interventions was agreed
that helped BI increase its competitiveness. This resulted in increasing the innovation capacity of
BI, as indicated by awards of UKF grants to BI research; awards of competitive funds from FP7
with foreign partners; and increased networking and membership in the international network of
European R&D institutions.

Coordination was established among the agencies, which efficiently developed a good practice
of sharing data on beneficiaries, including a referencing system for particular R&D programs.
The agencies also benefitted mutually from the respective programs – generating added value to
the final beneficiaries, both among SMEs and research groups. For instance, BICRO‟s pipeline
for SPREAD benefitted from companies that were identified by RI, while BI benefitted from
BICRO and UKF programs. Universities of Zagreb and Rijeka shared documents and
experiences and participated in UKF programs together with researchers from RBI and BI.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The ICR rates the overall Borrower performance as moderately satisfactory. Government and
MSES actions demonstrated their commitment to foster closer links between knowledge
institutions and the business sector, with renewed ownership of MSES, as of mid-term review,
with integration of the project within sector priorities. The agencies‟ commitment was equally
demonstrated by their responsiveness to project obligations, and initiatives in adjusting and
developing R&D programs that were conducive to generating innovation, and using the
knowledge for economic benefits to the society. Nevertheless, there were still various
bottlenecks encountered in the first two years of the project. These include a lack of progress on
BI and RBI restructuring, as envisaged in the original PDO, which prompted project



                                                15
restructuring; conditional loans imposed on SPREAD (as opposed to agreement on providing
matching grants); and the issue of counterpart financing. While these have been resolved thanks
to commitments of MSES and the agencies, they did contribute to implementation delays.

6. Lessons Learned

A first lesson learned from the Science and Technology Project is that innovation related projects
may achieve tangible results within a relative short time. STP achievements indicate that
Croatia‟s innovation performance was not constrained by a lack of ideas, as sometimes argued,
but by the availability of appropriate institutions – such as TTOs, early-stage financing and
mentoring services. By the end of the project, BICRO‟s pipeline of projects was large, exceeding
many times the amount of annually available funding. A change in mindset within the scientific
community gradually unfolded, as initial results showed that academic excellence and research
commercialization were not contradictory activities. A lesson potentially valid to several middle-
income countries, therefore, is that untapped sources of innovation could be unleashed provided
that an adequate institutional environment is in place.

A second lesson derives from factors seemingly critical for STP achievement: (i) focus on well
defined, quantifiable targets (enabling commercialization of publicly funded research and
supporting SME investments in R&D); (ii) design of a comprehensive set of instruments
targeting informational and financial bottlenecks inherent to innovation processes (TTOs and
BICRO programs); (iii) a transparent and meritocratic governance regime of the support
programs; and (iv) monitoring schemes put in place in the beginning, allowing the necessary
adjustments to materialize. More specific lessons in terms of the instruments used are:
    BICRO‟s pro-active role in nurturing and developing ideas into financeable projects was
     critical for the development of a sound pipeline – a result that countries without equivalent
     organizations often fail to achieve. This role, combined with provision of different financing
     instruments to different stages of the innovation chain, may represent the main advantage of
     organizations dedicated to promotion of knowledge-driven startups and R&D in SMEs.
    The UKF Cooperability Program shows that it is possible to mobilize scientific Diaspora in
     order to significantly contribute to the excellence of local research. One reason for the
     program‟s success is the focus on promoting collaboration rather than “bringing back?
     scientists living abroad – as is often the case of efforts to reverse "brain drain.?

A third lesson can be learned from what STP could not achieve, namely: restructuring research
institutes and promoting a venture capital industry. The failure in fostering restructuring of
research organizations was caused by a combination of political and technical difficulties. While
a complex political economy is to some extent inherent to any restructuring process, a technical
difficulty found in STP was related to definition of the own concept of restructuring, as BI did
not count with direct government support and was financially self-sustained. Moreover, the
appropriate combination of public and private funding will depend on the role of the research
organization within the country‟s S&T policy and can hardly be defined ex-ante.28 The lesson

  Unlike privatization of state-owned enterprises, where the goal is to transfer potentially viable firms and close down non-
sustainable ones, there might be a rationale for supporting research organizations that are not commercially sustainable due to the


                                                               16
therefore seems to be that restructuring public research organization would be better undertaken
as a result of the consensus built around their role in Croatia‟s S&T policy and the corresponding
research infrastructure strategy.

STP seems also to have underestimated the complexities in developing market-driven venture
funds in the country. The request for the managing firm to mobilize additional EUR 10 million
during the financial crisis was per se a challenging task, as indicated by the dramatic drop in
venture capital financing worldwide. The lack of a clear portfolio of prospective investments at
the time the program was implemented (half way through project implementation) imposed
additional difficulties and did not contribute to attractiveness of the investment. In addition,
Croatia‟s investors have shown to be unprepared to take (and manage) this type of risk of
technological (rather than commercial) nature and with longer maturity periods (7-10 years). The
lessons in this case seem related to the importance of a tangible portfolio of investment
opportunities and of technical assistance (in the form of “on the job training?) to jump-start the
private market for venture financing in middle-income economies.

A fourth lesson relates to sustainability of achieved results. By the end of the project, funds for
continuation of the newly created programs had not been secured. The legal status of BICRO and
UKF is currently being reviewed by the new administration. TTOs still have to fully integrate
with their parent organizations (RBI and Universities of Zagreb and Rijeka) and are currently
struggling to finance operating costs. Solutions, however, are envisaged. The Government plans
to use EU funds (available as of mid 2013) to expand and stabilize the funding gap. The Science
and Innovation Investment Fund (an IPA funded program) has been established to partially
finance TTO activities. A follow up operation to STP (STP II), focused on preparing the R&D
sector to efficiently absorb EU funds has been requested from the Bank and is under preparation.
Yet, facing severe fiscal constraints and a relatively rigid budget structure, the Government
failed to prioritize the support for R&D programs – despite the explicit recognition of the
importance of innovation for Croatia‟s economic development in the coming years. This in turn
reflects challenges faced by transition economies in mainstreaming innovation policies.

In order to support client countries in mainstreaming innovation policies, a programmatic
approach may be needed – combining different Bank instruments (development policy loans;
technical assistance and program for results loans) in order to sequentially address the different
challenges in designing, managing and evaluating innovation policies. A full-fledged country
strategy aimed at increasing the contribution of knowledge to development as part of the CPS
could help establish a framework for Bank support. This would also allow for adjustment of
policy instruments to evolving country conditions, thus increasing Bank support effectiveness.
This approach cannot be achieved in one, but a series of projects. In the case of Croatia, the
World Bank Second Technical Assistance Loan (TAL 2) tried de facto to provide for the key
reforms and capacity building while the envisaged STP II would build on the achievement and
lessons derived from STP and respond to new country challenges and opportunities related to full
EU integration.



positive externalities of noncommercial research. The problem looks like much more of a public-private partnership; in other
words, how much public support is really needed for those organizations that lie between pure basic research (full support) and
pure marketable research (zero support).

Component A (revised): Encouraging Commercialization of Publicly-Funded Research.
Rating: Satisfactory

Brodarski Institute:

The objective of this component was to strengthen the BIs to promote applied research and
commercialize results. BI was supported by the project through assistance in corporate
governance, business processes, human resource development, upgrading physical infrastructure
and commercialization. The project financed equipment for research projects, consulting services
and training, and on a selective basis, incremental operating costs and severance payments for
staff downsizing in certain areas.

Achievements:
       Brodarski Institute was successful in broadening the collaboration with the industry and
increasing its share of revenues from private contracts. It concluded 41 research contracts with
industry of over EUR 9 million and doubled its share of revenues from private companies from
22% in 2006 to 45 % by end 2010. The share of revenues from new activities increased from 1
percent in 2006 to 48 %. Additional revenues were generated from the participation in four FP7
programs and from international contracts. BI established the Competence Centre Eco
Technologies that received support from TEHCRO program.
       The initial project objective of restructuring was partially achieved. Although BI reported
a self sufficiency ratio of 96% by end project (100% target), the sustainability is still volatile and
jeopardized by high costs with the labor force and for maintenance, particularly heating (which
in turn is associated to the costs of maintenance of the hydrodynamic laboratory). BI' domestic
revenues dropped due to the reduction of contracts with the shipyard industry, itself undergoing
major restructurings. Central to restructuring efforts was the governance structure that impeded
its transformation into an efficient market-oriented organization that could survive without
public funding.
       BI‟s infrastructure benefited from investment in new equipments for research, its IT
network was established, and new management methods (strategic management, change

management, business development, annual business planning and budgetary procedures, and
cost accounting) were introduced. BI obtained ISO 14001 certification and it‟s preparing for the
implementation of ISO 18001 standards for health and safety management.
       BI broadened the cooperation and networking activities on European level. The project
contributed to improving project management skills and to changing the behaviors of the
researchers towards a more competitive approach to cooperation. As a spillover of BI‟s
cooperation agreement with PERA, a UK-based innovation and business support organization,
BI participated in four EC‟s FP7 projects with Croatian SME partners. BI became member of
European Association of Research Technology Organization (EARTO). In this capacity
participated to the FP8 Task force meetings and applied for the EARTO innovation Prize with
Fire Rob (autonomous fire fighter robot vehicle).
       Lastly, significant cultural and capacity changes occurred in the BI as result of the
project. Besides their technical competences, the BI staff acquired project management abilities
enabling them to prepare and submit projects for EU funding. More significantly, the need for a
deeper restructuring of the institute is now better understood by both management and staff and
the boundaries of the needed changes better identified.

Rudjer Innovations:

The objective of Rudjer Innovations inclusion in the project was to facilitate commercialization
of knowledge generated by RBI. RI expended its role and made the necessary outreach strategy,
which enabled it also to act as technology transfer intermediary outside the Institute.

   Box I: Spin-offs funded by Rudjer Innovations:
     Rudjer Medikol Diagnostics and Rudjer Medicol Cyclotron are two joint ventures between a private
     health-care provider, Medicol Polyclinic, and the Rudjer Boskovic Institute/Rudjer Innovations.
     Medicol Cyclotron JP provides highly sophisticated nuclear medicine services for diagnostics of cancer
     – PET/CT – which has not been available in Croatia. The Croatian Health Insurance Fund committed to
     co-finance PET tests for the general population, based on international standard criteria. The knowledge
     of the IRB scientists will be used to operate the cyclotron, which is needed to create radionuclides for
     the PET. At the same time, researchers will be able to use cyclotron, purchased by Medicol, to do the
     research work on creating new radionuclides.
     Rudjer Medicol Diagnostics is a JV with the RBI‟s Department for molecular medicine and is aimed at
     running genetic testing of hereditary breast cancer. Research studies have proved that certain gene
     mutations increase the chance of developing cancer, depending on family history. Voluntary screening
     of persons whose close relatives have developed cancer could establish whether the persons have the
     gene mutations and possibly increased risk of developing the disease. IRB has already been certified
     with the European protocol for breast cancer screening.
     Initium futuri was founded by a group of four undergraduates from the Faculty of Organization and
     Informatics (University of Zagreb) to provide innovative ICT solutions in telemedicine. Funding
     provided by RI of EUR 154.000 has enabled establishing the spin off and operational costs of one year.
     In less than one year the spin off has already signed interesting business contracts and employed an
     additional staff. The innovations the group generated were successfully presented at European and
     international trade shows, including at the Microsoft annual Imagine Cup Innovation Program, while in
     October they were invited to the finals of the 2008 International Federation of Inventors‟ Associations
     in China.




                                                       22
Achievements:
       RI was successful in establishing spillover companies and concluding licensing
agreements, including with prestigious international institutions. Five spin-off companies were
established with project contribution of about EUR 1.5 million: Rudjer Medikol Cyclotron
(RMC), Rudjer Medikol Diagnostics (RMD), Intium Futuri, BioZyne and Artes Calculi. Two of
these companies are already sustainable, one is in incubation period and the remaining two made
initial steps towards sustainability. Four other innovations from RBI where assessed with
promising commercial value, however need further development and financing for the pre-
commercial phase. 12 licensing agreements, amounting to EUR 750,000 were concluded with
clients such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Brown University. In addition five
patents were granted and 37 patent applications were filed.
       The future sustainability of RI is a concern. Such technology transfer institutions need on
average 10-15 years to become sustainable, provided that there is solid inflow of innovations
coming from the parent research institution. Given its legal status RI is not a state budget user,
except through RBI, and could not directly apply for EU IPA grant schemes, only as a partner.

University of Zagreb (UoZ) and University of Rijeka (UoR)

The objective of UoZ and UoR inclusion in the project in 2008 was to support the
commercialization efforts of the two universities, following the establishment of the UoZ
Technology Transfer Office (UoZ TTO) and University of Rijeka Technology Office (UoR
TTO), respectively.. The TTOs had as objective the development and commercialization of the
results generated from the scientific and research activities conducted in the universities.

Achievements:
       University of Zagreb developed and formally adopted the Intellectual Property Rules
TTO book, after broad consultations with component faculties, R&D Committee and various
scientific councils.     This document defined the procedure for IP protection and
commercialization and the revenue-share scheme for licensing. The procedures were tested in
about 60 cases that entered into the TTO pipeline. As result, 18 IPs were transferred to the TTO
and eight were finally applied for patent protection. In addition, two contracts with the industry
were signed.
       Four other commercialization policy documents were prepared and are in different stages
of consultations before their formal adoption: (i) Guidelines on University Intellectual Property
Management; (ii) Guidelines on University spinouts; (iii) Center for Research, Development and
Technology Transfer (CRDTT) Rule book; and (iv) Knowledge Exchange Regulations.
       UoZ TTO became an important resource for supporting researchers to prepare
applications for the Proof of Concept program, managed by BICRO. As result of the services
provided to researchers in preparing the project applications, 50 projects were submitted for
approval and 20 were approved by BICRO, amounting to about EUR 400,000.
       UoZ TTO was successful in promoting commercialization and in raising awareness: it
organized more than 60 workshops and other events where about 3,000 researchers participated.
The workshops covered topics as IP management, knowledge exchange and entrepreneurship.




                                                23
       UoZ TTO launched efforts in establishing the Office as one-stop shop for consultants for
various fields and created a database of IPs. It also started a Technology and Expertise mapping
exercise, finalized so far for two faculties of the UoZ.
       University of Rijeka developed and adopted formally the IPR Rule book for IPs transfer
to the TTO UoR. Thus, the mission of the TTO would be to extract the fair market value of the
University‟s intellectual property and stimulate the creation of future commercially viable IP
using best practices for the benefit of the University and its component faculties. The TTO will
closely collaborate with STeP, the University‟s Research Office and Science Managers at key
faculties in screening, evaluating and protecting commercially viable innovative projects,
technologies, products and services and facilitating the transfer of R&D and new technologies to
the business sector. As result, one patent application was filed and two prior art searches were
done. In addition, two research contracts were concluded with industry.
       UoR TTO was successful in the cooperation with the City Council of Rijeka, which
approved the Sustainable Energy Action Plan. This opens further opportunities for collaboration
between the university and small companies in the field of renewable energy.
       UoR was successful in attracting young researchers in cross faculty knowledge sharing
and commercialization of the research results; 97 students submitted 17 projects as result of the
competition organized by UoR TTO. Five projects were publicly promoted and presented in
media. through the organization of student competition

Component B. BICRO: R&D financing program for enterprises (EUR 17.8 mln):
Rating: Satisfactory

The objective of this component was to increase the abilities of SMEs to invest in R&D, by
providing means and appropriate financing mechanisms to support development, use and
adaptation of new technologies, promote growth of technology-rich companies, improve quality
of the products by industry, which ultimately, will contribute to the improvement of
competitiveness of Croatian firms. Financial support was provided through a mix of financial
instruments, including matching grants and loans. STP supported the development of one
previously-existing BICRO program, RAZUM, and of two additional programs: TEHCRO, and
SPREAD. A third new program was initially envisaged in STP, aiming to promote technology
commercialization by stimulating the development of venture capital in Croatia (VenCRO). This
program was dropped as part of the July 2009 project restructuring. STP also supported
BICRO‟s institutional development through direct co-financing of the different industry support
instruments and by helping it upgrade its institutional capabilities, including managerial and
technical skills, HR system, marketing, business development, MIS, financial management and
planning, and monitoring and evaluation functions.

RAZUM Program (EUR 8.03 million):

The objective of the RAZUM program was to support the development of knowledge-based
SMEs with a potential to have a positive impact on economic development. The program
provided loans covering up to 70 percent of new product development costs, with maximum
support of EUR 1.5 million per project and duration of up to three years. Award decisions were
taken by BICRO based on candidates‟ business plans and on the viability of projects. Thus,

    applications (135 outline applications):

    Box II: Innovative projects funded by RAZUM
        Service & Resource Management Architecture Software (SRMA) responded to a growing demand for an
        effective management IT solution for service-oriented businesses operating in highly labour-intensive and
        knowledge-intensive business environments. With RAZUM support, the Company designed a fully integrated
        management IT solution which encompasses three platforms:
-       Knowledge Management System (KMS)
-       Business Process Management System (BMPS)
-       Program Management Office (PMO)
        Not only is the resulting SRMA platform the only product in the market which solves the system integration
        issue, it is also more cost-effective than combining three separate systems. The importance of such software
        tools are shown by the fact that Gartner, a leading consulting service, in its regular annual report noted that the
        development of such tools, as well as their applications in business practices, have recorded permanent growth.
        The first copy of the solution was sold to NEXE group.
        SYSTEMCOM (Chip-input Interface for Nanotechnology Biosensors) responded to a growing demand for
        electronic equipments, particularly for nanotechnology biosensors. The chip developed provides an IP module
        and/or ASIC solution for the analogue front-end (AFE) function, optimized for current-input, low power & high
        resolution applications. This chip provides a complete signal path between sensor system and microcontroller,
        generating a digital output proportional to the input current. It is ideally suited for a broad range of devices with
        the sensor system - where the generic information about the phenomenon under detection (light or other
        physical or chemical or electrochemical appearance) - passes the first electrical conversion to the current. This
        is usually the case in biomedical electronic devices, including battery-powered operation, but also in other “bio?
        fields as well as in energy & process control / instrumentation / automotive & security / aircraft & military, etc.
        The IP module implementation enables easy further System on Chip (SoC) integration of follow-up functions.
        Company Pet minuta Ltd. benefited from RAZUM financing to develop a personal software platform for
        mobile phones named ShoutEm, which allows social networks to communicate over mobile phones, through
        high-quality solutions. It requires minimal hardware expense and IT knowledge and is therefore both easy to
        use and affordable. The product showed such commercial potential after its test phase that Slovenian venture
        capital fund, RSG Capital, invested $1.2 million to develop ShoutEm into a global product. Five Minutes
        founders now run ShoutEm in UK too. The company has been operating successfully in Croatia for the past four
        years and in the past year earned 90 percent of its revenues from exports. Its recent international contacts
        include the cooperation with major American companies such as Real Network. (www.real.com)
        Altpro Ltd. is an innovative exporting company whose main business is the development and production of
        high-technology signaling and safety equipment for railway infrastructure and vehicles. The company used
        RAZUM financing to develop a product based on so-called axle counters applied in road crossings. The product
        is based on innovative, security intelligence center-designed modular units. These units satify the so-called SIL4
        security level, which is the higest level of security stipulated by the European Committee for Electrotechnical
        Standardisation (CENELEC). This level of security, combined with the detection system in once single device
        represents an optimal solution for safe, reliable crossings.

    working on the project, but did not have enough capacity to work on other innovations and to
    engage in additional R&D activities and 35 percent managed to work on additional R&D
    activities in parallel with the project itself.
   R&D human capacity increase appeared to be sustainable: 80 percent of the firms intend to
    keep the newly hired staff after the project closure.

SPREAD (IrCRO) - Sponsored Research and Development) Program (EUR 2 million)

The objective of the SPREAD program was to encourage SMEs to invest in R&D, facilitate ties
with R&D institutes (RDIs) and universities and help the latter expand their industry network
and outreach. The SPREAD program was in essence a risk sharing scheme designed to address
the market failure of underinvestment in R&D and the lack of trust and collaboration between
industry and the knowledge community. The program funded up to 50 percent of the cost of joint
projects through non-reimbursable matching grants to develop or adapt new products or
processes, with a maximum contribution of EUR 80,000.

    Box III: Innovative projects funded by SPREAD (IrCRO)
     INTECO - Robot for hydrodynamic treatment of cement and metal surfaces. The project financed the
     development of an advanced prototype of a robot for hydrodynamic processing of concrete and metal
     surfaces and of additional, attachable tools. While the basic prototype of the robot was developed prior to the
     project, the development of the advance prototype required a close cooperation with the scientists from the
     Laboratory for Robotics and Intelligent Control Systems of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and
     Computing, University of Zagreb. The utilization of the robot is mainly in construction (the restoration and
     preparation of cement surfaces) and shipbuilding (preparation of metal surfaces) activities. The advantages of
     the solution lie in its electrical propulsion and its small and dismountable, lightweight and user-friendly
     design. It can function autonomously once placed on site with its built-in system for self-guidance.
     Racuni.hr Ltd is specialized in the field of the development and implementation of e-bills and e-file
     systems. Through their system, users can easily manage creating and sending digital bills for efficient
     payments. More than 10 million bills are delivered in Croatia alone, and most of these are delivered
     physically, on paper. SPREAD financing allowed the company to develop data processing platform for e-
     bills with ability of hosting services and frames. The project end-result would allow facilitating the invoicing
     procedure, minimize mistakes, provide better overview of cash flows, while being environmentally fiendly
     for citizens and public institutions.

    Box V: Innovative projects funded by Proof of Concept
     Azonprinter Ltd received financing for its project „ProChecking the innovative concept of the machine for
     digital printing on all materials for industry“. It is about a new technology that enables printing with different
     types of inks on objects of various sizes and functionalities with different kinds of surfaces, such as heating
     cells or photocells for solar power generation. The project helped developed a prototype machine for digital
     printing that by using environmentally friendly inks enables print on all materials, without any preparatory and
     coatings. This is an improved technological solution because it allows the printing of very high quality, small
     series, a large number of mutations, environmentally friendly inks with no preparations object to which the
     press. After this phase, Azonprinter will go into commercial production and sales of technical solutions through
     a network of existing international dealers. The above technology has a great application in the glass industry,
     aluminum, and other designs.
     Veski Ltd benefited from PoC financing for its project „Device for continuous monitoring of wind turbines
     with integrated control functions of mechanical and electrical parameters“. The concept of this product is based
     on the implementation of an algorithm for continuous monitoring of the drive generator status (measurements
     of electrical parameters), in combination with conventional measurements of mechanical parameters. The
     innovation consists of an application and linking of information on one single device (as compared to a more
     expensive and complex solution of two or more devices). This represents an improved technology of
     monitoring the wind gernerator and incorporating the wind energy with different measurements. The project
     developed the algorithm that can provide concise information management systems and facilitate the
     management of aggregate, increased security and efficiency. After successful testing of the model, the company
     completed the prototype device, filed a patent, and is developing its commercialisation plan.

    Applied Neuro-Fuzzy Control of Turbine Governors and Ship Rudder Systems. Goals of the project
    were to establish laboratories for advanced industrial regulation systems in Brodarski Institute, transfer of
    knowledge from the field of advanced regulation systems and development of regulation algorithms with
    neuron networks and fuzzy control algorithms for turbine governor and ship rudder systems. The laboratory
    has been established and is being used regularly, for scientific research and commercial projects. It has been
    used in projects in HE Lešće and HE Čakovec, which was created by the Brodarski Institute. The knowledge
    gained with the use of the laboratory equipment has been used in the development and activation of the
    wave generator regulator, a device that creates waves in test pools for testing ship models for sailing
    conditions in wavy waters or for testing port profiles in wavy waters.
    Physiology of SCUBA diving (Young Researchers and Professionals Program). The project collaborated
    with Diving Alert Network, Norwegian University of Science and Technology and other partners. The
    results of this project were partially used for the application to the EU Framework 7 programme in the Marie
    Curie Initial training network category with Split group as partners. Other participants include several
    partners from industry and SME, including one large international company, MARES. Based on the results
    collected as part of the UKF project, a grant application was submitted to the US Navy (Office for Naval
    Research) and based on the first evaluation, a one year funding is to be awarded. This way, the group from
    the Department of Physiology at Split School of Medicine will become the second research team (besides
    investigators from Israel) outside of the United States that is funded by the US Navy.
    Study and development of ultrasonic non-destructive examination systems (SONDE). The aim of the
    project is to set up an ultrasonic applications research group focused on design, development, production and
    testing of "made in Croatia" customized ultrasound probes for non-destructive evaluation of structural health
    in nuclear and fossil fuel power plants. At present, several prototypes have been finalized and tested. One set
    of the final products is planned to be sent to Slovenia for performance demonstration purposes, and another
    to be used in an inspection in Hungary. The project leader returned to Croatia upon receiving the UKF
    project. The project collaborates with several local and international institutions including the Swiss Federal
    Institute of Technology, Georgia Institute of Technology, and University of Zagreb. Other results include
    publications, training of PhD students, and several patent applications.
    Research, Development and Construction of portable micro X-Ray Fluorescence Device
    The goal of the project was development of a prototype of a portable instrument for the microanalysis of x-
    ray fluorescence (micro-XRF), which in many aspects would be superior to similar high-quality devices
    currently available on the market. The potential use of such a versatile instrument covers a wide field of use
    in archaeometry, museology, the chemical industry, environmental research, forensics, metallurgy, etc. The
    original design developed within the project was a transfer of a combination of scientific and technological
    knowledge, which was acquired by the team leader abroad, and the mutual efforts of the team of Croatian
    professionals, who are prepared to transform their theoretical and practical knowledge into a unique, high-

earmarked to RI. These changes were not considered as requiring project restructuring and were
approved as reallocation of loan proceeds.


Box VII. Benchmarking of BICRO and RBI components
    Project instruments were tested by benchmarking eleven BICRO financed companies and RBI
start-ups with their U.S. counterparts. A set of U.S. companies that are recipients of public funds
through Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer
were compared to recipients of BICRO funds and RBI start-ups. Comparison showed that all
entities demonstrated a market and business vision, and product/service status comparable to their
U.S. counterparts, given their stage of development. Both institutes were employing a good
quality screening mechanism to solicit, assess, and deploy funding support to high technology,
innovative companies of merit that have the potential to grow.
   The funding provided by these programs was instrumental in advancing the development of
these enterprises and sustaining their businesses during the critical periods inherent to early stage
enterprises.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The project is assessed to have achieved a high level of efficiency. The PAD justified the
efficiency of the project based on (i) results from developed countries that showed that the rate of
return on R&D investments is around 20% and on (ii) the public good nature of the intervention.
Cost-benefit analyses are however not easily applicable to evaluating efficiency of the project for
a number of reasons:
i. The gap between social (economic) and private rates of return – the latter measured by
   internal rates of return (IRR).
ii. IRR in the present case would also be highly dependent on the values assigned to the results
    of commercialization activities (especially the value of patents and of spinoff companies)
iii. Intangible benefits related to capacity building (corresponding to a non-negligible share of
     the project), as for instance in the case of UKF‟s invitation to start negotiations for the FP7
     COFUND project (EUR 7 million would be available in next five years).

In the absence of standard cost-benefit analyses, we follow ICR Guidelines 38 and use two
different methods to evaluate project efficiency, through estimates of (a) social opportunity costs,
(b) cost effectiveness. A third method assessing the outcomes of the RAZUM program (in terms
of research capability and job creation) is presented in Box A.3.3.

Estimating social opportunity costs

To estimate the social opportunity cost of investments in R&D, we compare the rate of return on
R&D with other possible public investments in Croatia. For practical reasons, we chose to limit
the comparison to investments in education and infrastructure – the bulk of the projects of the
country‟s 2010 Economic Recovery Program. Using standard techniques, we computed the rate
of return on R&D and infrastructure investments in the country and used results of the literature
for the returns on education in middle income countries (Box A.3.1). Our findings show that
estimated rates of returns on R&D in Croatia (73 percent) are at least double the value of returns
of infrastructure (around 24-34 percent) and seven times higher than in education (around 10
percent – or ten times higher if the rate of return for schooling for high income countries (7.4
percent) is used). Results for R&D and infrastructure are consistent with the findings of the
economic research. Higher returns for R&D in Croatia are consistent with the relatively lower
stock of R&D capital vis-à-vis the stock of infrastructure and human capital in the country. 39

Box A.3.1. Macro Level Analysis on Social Returns to R&D, Infrastructure, and Human Capital
Using World Development Indicators macro level data, we compute the rate of return on gross R&D investment.
Following the methodologies used in Coe and Helpman (1995), Jones and Williams (1998), and Lederman and
Maloney (2003), we first construct R&D capital stock and then find the elasticity of various output measures with
respect to R&D capital and computed gross rate of return (see table below). Rate of return on R&D investment for
GDP measured in constant LCU is 73%. Based on these findings, optimal amount of R&D investment can be
estimated. In Croatia this amounts to 9.23% of GDP. Real interest rate in Croatia between 1997 and 2010 is around

7.3%. Current gross rate of return is 0.73% which is close to 10 times less than real interest rate. As a result, optimal
amount of R&D expenditure would be 0.92*10=9.2% where 0.92 is the average R&D expenditure (as a % of GDP).
Using macro level data, there are several studies that estimate the rates of return to R&D. Among these studies,
Lederman and Maloney (2003) use cross-country data for 1975-2000 period and find that returns to R&D
investment is around 78%. They group countries according to their income levels and find: 20-40% as OECD
average, 60% for medium-income countries, and around 100% for poor countries. Returns to R&D in developing
countries are higher than the values for industrialized countries. Coe and Helpman (1995) estimate rates of return to
R&D for the period 1991-1990 and find 123% for the G7 and 85% for the remaining 15 OECD countries.
Lichtenberg (1994) works with a cross section of 53 countries and argues that the return to private R&D investment
is seven times larger than to fixed investments. The result for rate of return obtained for Croatia is in accordance
with the studies in the literature.

Canning and Bennathan (2003) compute the rate of return to infrastructure (electricity generation and paved
roads). They find that return to electricity generation capacity is 50% where the values vary significantly across
countries. To give some examples, in Turkey, rate of return is 32%, in Yugoslavia 24%, Portugal 7%, Mexico 51%,
and Brazil 10%. They find the rate of return to paved roads as 30%. In their study, elasticities of GDP per worker
with respect to electricity services is 9% for a country at median income level and 6% for a country at the lower
quartile. Elasticity of GDP per worker with respect to paved roads is 9% for a median income level country and 5%
for a lower income level country. In a recent study Drezgic (2008) estimates the elasticity of GDP across Croatian
counties with respect to transport and electricity sectors. The elasticity varies around 4.7% and 4.6% for transport
and electricity sectors, respectively. In another specification where he combines transport, electricity, and
construction sectors, elasticity of GDP with respect to this combined sector is 6%. Based on these estimates, rate of
return on infrastructure in Croatia can be estimated using the methodology used in Canning and Bennathan (2000).

Consider Y  AK L X as the Cobb-Douglas production function where K is physical capital, L is labor and X is
infrastructure capital. Solving the aggregate production function, we get the following first order conditions
       rK     p X            Where px is rate of return to infrastructure capital and r is the rate of return to physical capital.
?        ,?  x

Drezgic (2008) compute net capital stocks for each industry in Croatia from 1996 to 2006. He shows that electricity
sector makes around 19% of total private capital stock (X=zK where z is a multiplier). Transportation sector makes
21% of total private capital stock. Return to private capital stock which is the real interest rate is around 7.3%.
Using this information average rate of return on electricity and transportation sectors can be calibrated as follows.
       ?Y       ?Y       ?Y   ?r
px                       
       X        zK       ?Y z?
                         z
             r   According to this formula and using the estimates obtained from Drezgic (2008) rate of return to
infrastructure is 34% for electricity and 32% for transportation, and 24% when electricity, transport, and
construction sectors are combined.
The literature on rates of return to human capital is much older. Psacharopoulos (1994) estimate the social returns
to investment in education level for a large number of countries. An updated study which presents results for the
same countries in Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2004) find that average rate of return to an additional year of
schooling is 9.7%. Returns for low, middle, and high income countries are 10.9%, 10.7%, and 7.4% in respective
order. The value for Croatia is likely to be around 10.7%.
These findings on rates of returns on R&D, infrastructure, and human capital show that the returns to R&D
(73%) are quite significant and higher than the returns of infrastructure (around 24-34%) or human capital
(around 10%).

Assessing cost effectiveness

We also analyze project efficiency using the notion of cost effectiveness to determine whether
the project represented the expected least-cost solution to attain identified and measurable
benefits. In order to assess the efficiency of the projects, one must ask a hypothetical counter-
factual question, namely: Would the two development objectives be achieved without the project
support? The idea is that a negative response to this question would imply a high level of
efficiency of the project for it generates an outcome otherwise inexistent with a finite budget
(total cost of the project).

By providing technical assistance to TTOs fostering collaboration with the business sector, the
project enabled research institutions to commercialize research outputs that would otherwise be
idle. Research commercialization is one of the central challenges for increasing the impact of
R&D investments on economic development in Croatia and other transition economies and was
essentially non-existing prior to implementation of STP, according to the opinion of local experts
and scientists. By subsidizing the collaboration between enterprises and public research
organization, the SPREAD program (a classical matching grant scheme) contributes to reduce
the risk of the partnership, perceived by both parties as high due to reputational factors – a
supposed poor quality of research in public research organizations and supposed irrelevance of
research proposed by the private sector.

The results of the program may be preliminarily inferred from a survey implemented by the
Zagreb Institute of Economics (ZIE) (Box A.3.2): enterprises beneficiary of SPREAD programs
seem to, on average, agree with the statement that the collaboration would not exist otherwise
(average score: 3.5).40 Firms also believe that without such collaboration, the same results would
be achieved within a longer period and the scope of the research would be significantly reduced
(Table A.3.1). While other factors may affect the likelihood of research commercialization, no
other relevant events strong enough to alter the behavior of scientists and businessmen are
known and the overall incentive regime remained the same.

Similarly, by providing financing for business related R&D through Proof of Concept (small
grants to finance early stage financing) and RAZUM (a conditional loan for later stage
innovation) the project seems to have generated positive additional effects on SMEs‟ ability to
invest in R&D – rather than substituting for private investments that would have occurred in the
absence of the public intervention. BICRO‟s programs target the so-called “Valley of Death? –
an early stage development phase of startup companies for which financing is known to be less
available.41 In addition to overcoming this structural factor, BICRO‟s program helped to mitigate

   The market failure for funding early stage ventures is related to information asymmetry and moral hazard problems that are
classical in financial markets but particularly relevant in the case of early stage financing (see Lerner, J. and Hall, B. (2009) “The
Financing of R&D and Innovation,? NBER Working Paper No. 15325). Since the innovator has the information on the success of
its project which the investor lacks, a financial gap is formed between the two parties. The funds provided by BICRO and
research institutes alleviated these market failures and led to successful spin-offs and commercialization of innovative ideas.


                                                                 36
 the liquidity constraints for business investments in R&D generated by deleveraging of financial
 markets and increased risk aversion of investors in the wake of the global crisis.42

 The results of RAZUM may also be preliminarily inferred from the ZIE survey: In the absence of
 program funding, a third of companies would not have been able to start activities, while others
 would have tried to plough on mostly relying on their own resources. Consequently, product
 development would be slower and most likely scaled down. Potential market advantage would be
 diminished or lost. Smaller budget would have affected the duration of the project (would have
 been longer), scope of the project (smaller), R&D capacity through additional employment of
 R&D staff (lower), and innovativeness level of the project (also lower). A similar evaluation was
 made by OECD for EU and Austria programs, reaching comparable results (Table A.3.2).

 A similar result was achieved for the UKF Cooperability Program. The absence of funding
 would have lowered the level and quality of scientific and/or technological output, would have
 resulted in fewer papers published in top ranked international scientific journals, and would have
 precluded access to necessary research equipment. Furthermore, it would have been harder for
 researchers to develop cooperation with researchers of the Croatian Diaspora and with foreign
 scientists, as well as to educate young researchers abroad (Table A.3.1). Another important result
 that helps to understand the impact of UKF in terms of research excellence: projects supported
 by UKF were two times more likely to obtain additional funding from FP7 than the average
 Croatian project application.

   One important effect of the crisis is that cash deprived firms had to use more internal funds to finance working capital thereby
 reducing the availability of internal funds for new investments, including for R&D (see Correa and Iootty (2010)).

   Box A.3.2. STP Assessment by the Zagreb Institute of Economics – Key Methodological Aspects
       The assessment of STP is based on the surveys conducted to beneficiaries of three programs, RAZUM and
   SPREAD (from BICRO) and UKF‟s Cooperability Grants. Based on preliminary interviews with some of the
   beneficiaries of these programs a survey was designed and implemented on a large sample of firms/scientists.
   For RAZUM program the survey-participants included both recipients of funds and firms that are either still in
   the evaluation process or are approved and waiting for financing. For SPREAD program firms that are
   recipients of SPREAD and have begun to work on the project were included (there were no pending projects
   for SPREAD). For UKF program both successful and unsuccessful applicants were surveyed.
       The goal of these questionnaires was to find out to what extent the recipients benefited from program
   funding and in case of UKF it also intended to show to what extent did the non-recipients “suffered? because
   they were turned down for the funding. They were sent to the entire populations of recipients of RAZUM,
   SPREAD and UKF Across the Borders Grant. Population of RAZUM recipients consisted of 22 firms of which
   20 responded to the questionnaire. Out of 24 firms waiting for RAZUM funding, 14 responded to the survey.
   18 out of 20 recipients of a SPREAD grant participated in the study. UKF Cooperability Grant financed 26
   projects and 20 successful applicants responded to the survey. Among unsuccessful applicants to UKF, 15 out
   of 79 responded to the questionnaire. Questionnaires were sent to managers/scientists that participated directly
   in the projects.
       The study measured input, output, and behavioral additionality created by the programs. Output
   additionality deals with the extent to which the firm‟s output has changed as a result of having received a
   subsidy. It also captures the increments to firm‟s stock of knowledge capital resulting from the R&D project
   and the benefits derived from commercial application of R&D results. On the other hand, behavioural
   additionality deals with changes in firm behaviour that resulted from having received public support. It
   includes the changes in the breadth of innovation activities and changes in both technological and business
   strategies of the firms. To get the complete picture of subsidy effectiveness, three components of additionality
   were used together to determine whether the R&D would have been carried out without public support,
   whether the public funding changed the scale and scope of the R&D, or whether the R&D would have been
   done differently. To explore each of the three components of the concept, responses were collected on five-
   point Likert scale and multiple choices questions. To assess the additionality, questions were asked involving a
   “counterfactual scenario?, i.e. a hypothetical situation where recipients had to imagine they had been denied
   the grant.

Box A.3.3. Assessing outcomes - research capability job creation: The case of RAZUM
Methodology:
In a 2011 study, Radas and Anic apply qualitative research as well as quantitative analysis based on a survey of
selected RAZUM beneficiaries, following the methodology of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
program in the U.S, and assessing input, output and behavioral additionality. The additionality concept in this study
was adopted from Georghiou (1994), while treatment of particular aspects of additionality was adopted from
Clarysse et al. (2009) and Hsu et al. (2009). Following the long history of subjective measures of the effects of R&D
and innovation grants, the data on additionality was collected through self-assessment: such measures are widely
used and accepted in the field of evaluation research (Clarysse et al., 2009). Following extensive literature survey in
Hsu et al. (2009), and taking into account specificities of the RAZUM program Radas and Anic (2011) defined how
to measure the three dimensions of additionality (Table A.3.1). As in Hsu et al (2009), assessment of additionality
was made through questions involving a “counterfactual scenario?, i.e. a hypothetical situation where recipients had
to imagine being denied the grant.
                   Items used to assess input, output and behavioral additionality
                     Input             -   Scope and scale of the project
                     additionality     -   R&D intensity before and after the grant
                     Output            -   Number of new products/services introduced to the market
                     additionality     -   Number of new products/services under development
                     Behavioral        -   Innovation development process
                     additionality     -   New employment
                                       -   Collaboration
Findings:
In terms of input additionality, data showed that in absence of RAZUM funds, companies would have received a
lower budget, whereas activities would have been conducted on a smaller scale as well as in a slower pace.
Meanwhile, R&D intensity increased after start of the RAZUM program. By comparing firm‟s R&D intensity
before and after the start of the RAZUM grant, in 9 out of 15 companies, an increase in own R&D intensity was
observed after start of the grant (on average from 0.41 in the year before RAZUM grant to 0.44 in the year after the
beginning of the RAZUM grant).
The effect of RAZUM on output additionality can be seen in firms‟ innovation stock. The observed increase
indicates positive effect of the grant on firms‟ innovation pipeline. An interesting question is whether this increase
results from spillover of ideas from RAZUM to other projects. Majority of firms (17 out of 20 firms) reported that
they indeed generated ideas for new product/services during the RAZUM grant, although mostly they did not have
capacity to work on them. This indicates that the increase in the innovation pipeline reported in table 5 was not
caused by spillover ideas from RAZUM. Considering the magnitude of the increase, it is most likely caused by the
RAZUM product itself.
RAZUM also generated new employment (54 new jobs), most of which has been in R&D (48 jobs). The firms
expressed their intention to keep the new staff after closing of the grant, which suggests that firms anticipate
permanent increase in cash flow as a result of RAZUM (Wallstein, 2000). Moreover, without RAZUM funds, firms
would have been unable to hire new staff for the project and no new collaboration would have been established.
Since collaboration and employment of skilled staff raise R&D capacity of the firm, without RAZUM the
companies would have been unable to increase their R&D capabilities in the same way. The influx of knowledge
coming through collaborative networks would have also decreased. As expected, collaboration with firms would
have been affected less than collaboration with research institutions.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

The development impact of the project was assessed through qualitative and quantitative
research undertaken by the Zagreb Institute of Economics (ZIE), particularly related to
Innovation programs financed by the project. The overall effectiveness and efficiency of the
project, as perceived by actual and potential beneficiaries were investigated along two
dimensions. First, the effectiveness and efficiency of the program, i.e. the efficacy of the
programs to achieve its objectives as perceived by the private sector using project support and,
second, the administrative or institutional efficiency, i.e. the efficient management practices in
the organizations that implemented the program.

Overall assessment shows that project supported programs received very favorably:

(i) The evidence suggests the project had a positive impact on the Croat firms in terms
    additionalities in terms of technological effort and R&D spending, productivity and
    profitability, competitiveness (export intensity), employment generation. The program
    achieved to a large extent the intended outcomes in the Croatia‟s economy. Technological
    activities are expected to have long term impact on firms‟ performance. Since the program
    was just completed, only its short term impact was evaluated, and, in this sense, its real
    impact will extend over the long term only.

(ii) The conclusions regarding the efficiency of the management practices of the implementing
     agencies, particularly BICRO and UKF:
   a. RAZUM program. All companies that applied to RAZUM program rated it highly on
   most features. However, they pointed out weaknesses of RAZUM program that need to be
   improved. The procedure of project application should be simplified, and the evaluation
   process should be faster. Companies also believe that Croatian enterprises in general are not
   sufficiently acquainted with RAZUM program, signaling the need for stronger promotion in
   order to increase the awareness of the program. This finding was confirmed in the survey of
   potential users (high tech SMEs). The results of the survey show that companies that are not
   familiar with RAZUM rate the benefits of the program lower that RAZUM applicants. This
   result indicates that RAZUM could increase the number of applications if companies were
   better informed about possibility to realize benefits (for example from case studies of
   successful program graduates).
   b. SPREAD. Beneficiaries had a positive opinion about the program, with most of them
   claiming that would definitely or probably re apply with other projects. The general attitude
   was that financial support received was very beneficial to them. Companies also expressed
   positive attitude towards SPREAD‟s procedures of evaluation, application and granting the
   funds. However, they indicated a low level of acquaintance with the program, indicating the
   need for improvements in communication strategy for SPREAD. Generally, co-financing
   principle was judged as acceptable for entrepreneurs although some changes would be
   welcomed. Some entrepreneurs considered that their contribution should have been lower,
   and others considered that it should have been “in-kind?. The lack of awareness of SPREAD
   was confirmed in the survey of potential users (high tech SMEs). The results of the survey
   showed that companies that were not familiar with SPREAD rated the benefits of the
   program lower that SPREAD applicants. While this testifies to the quality of the program, it


                                               43
also suggests that raising awareness about possibility to realize benefits would increase the
number of applications to SPREAD.
c. UKF: Researchers were satisfied with UKF program, and 95 percent of them would
probably or definitely apply again to UKF with another similar project. They rated UKF
program high on all its features. However, researchers considered that the Croatian
community was not as well acquainted with UKF program, and thus more effort should be
made to promote UKF program in the Croatian academic community. Furthermore
researchers pointed out that UKF should invest more money in the research. Since the largest
numbers of UKF projects were directed at basic research, interest for commercialization of
UKF research results was rather low. While the cooperation with academic community was
excellent, the cooperation between researchers and business community was not so
successful. The scientists that applied but had not received the UKF funding showed not
significant disappointment about the negative outcome: more than a half of them would
apply again to the UKF program. Those that would not apply again expressed their doubts
about the fairness of evaluation process and the choice of referees. A significant share of all
surveyed researchers considered difficult to meet the co-financing principle, especially from
the business sector, and/or proposed that the required contribution be lower. UKF non-
recipients agreed that the UKF application procedure was well explained and that Croatian
scientists were well acquainted with the UKF program, but they had less positive opinion of
the transparency of the UKF program, evaluation process and feedback received from the
evaluators. Respondents seemed to be relatively confident about the quality of their
proposals: they plan to continue working on them and turn to other sources of funding. They
admitted that their ability to carry out the collaboration with the chosen foreign institution
could be damaged to some degree, but not too much. However, most affected could be the
young researchers and PhD students.

1. Project background and development

The Science and Technology Project (STP), financed through a World Bank (WB) Loan of 30
million EUR, with counterpart funding from the state budget of the Republic of Croatia in the
amount of 5.4 million EUR, was designed in line with the technology and innovation supporting
program of the Republic of Croatia. The Project beneficiary was the Ministry of Science,
Education and Sports (MSES). The primary objective of the Project was providing support to
companies based on knowledge and innovations and restructuring selected Croatian Research
and Development institutes (RDIs). The second goal had been shifted (after a Mid-term Review)
to supporting technology transfer and commercialization of innovation. The end beneficiaries
were the Project Agencies (PAs): (a) Brodarski Institute (BI), Rudjer Boskovic Institute
(RBI)/Rudjer Innovations (RI) and Business-Innovation Centre of Croatia (BICRO) which
received a combination of grants/soft loans from the Loan proceeds, according to pre-agreed
formulas and (b) Technology Transfer Offices (TTO‟s) of the University of Zagreb and
University of Rijeka, and Unity Through Knowledge Fund (UKF) (within MSES) which received
grants from the Loan proceeds. Ultimately, the final beneficiaries were also knowledge-intensive
SMEs, researchers and research groups eligible to benefit from sub-financing and innovation
financing programs under BICRO, UKF and RBI/RI in accordance with their agreed conditions.

The Project, due to its complexity and some external factors (consensus on strategic issues, the
government change, etc), went through an somewhat longer preparation period. From as early as
2003, funding under the Project TAL 2 in the amount of 1.6 million USD was utilized, primarily
for initial consulting services ranging from studies on the commercial potential of departments at
BI funding of two pilot R&D projects towards commercialization at RBI, study tours and
education of the PAs management staff, an attempt at mapping business processes at the two
institutes, etc.

In May 2005 the final Project Implementation Plan (PIP) was drafted. According to the PIP, the
initially planned STP implementation period was from November 2005 – November 2009. The
expected effectiveness date was set at October 31, 2005, and WB funding agreed in the amount
of 31 million EUR. The initial objectives were set as: i) Restructuring of RDI institutions; ii)
BICRO component – upgrading technological capabilities of enterprises; iii) implementing the
UKF. The Loan Agreement was signed on September 16, 2005, and ratified in the Croatian
Parliament in December 2005. However, the effectiveness date was moved to May 11, 2006.
This initial delay was due to a combination of unresolved issues: the Loan ratification took
longer than expected, due to the various legal procedures, and, most importantly, a crucial
document to be adopted by the Government, the Science and Technology Policy, could not be
finalized earlier due to a prolonged public debate and consensus building involving all
stakeholders in Croatian research and innovation system.

The main STP components were:
I. Restructuring of RDIs (8.2 million EUR from the Loan). This component includes
   institution building of selected RDIs (Brodarski institute, Ruder Boskovic Institute and
   others) through assistance in corporate management, development of business processes and


                                               46
   human resources, upgrading of infrastructure, and commercialization of research projects and
   technology transfer. Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) from two public Universities, the
   University of Zagreb (UoZ) and University of Rijeka (UoR) joined the project during
   implementation.
II. The Business Innovation Centre of Croatia (BICRO) component (15,8 million EUR from
    the Loan) supported several programs conducted by BICRO, a state owned company, whose
    role is focused on financing technology development in SMEs. These programs were:
    RAZUM - development of innovative technologies in SME‟s), TEHCRO - upgrading
    technology infrastructure, encompassing incubators and R&D centers, and IRCRO
    (SPREAD) - providing grants for financing collaborative research projects between SMEs
    and public sector RDIs.
III. The Unity through Knowledge Fund (UKF) (4.5 million EUR from the Loan) is a facility
     to attract Croatian scientists and researchers living abroad. The program financed
     collaborative projects of domestic and diaspora scientists, visits of eminent Croatian
     scientists and establishing cooperations between domestic and foreign RDIs.
IV. Other activities - (1.5 million EUR from the Loan) for support and building of the National
    Innovation System (NIS) and project implementation.

The two initial RDIs participating under 1st component were: RBI and BI. Following prolonged
negotiations and the fact that at RBI the research topics are predominantly in basic science (life
sciences, physics and chemistry), and at BI‟s research is within engineering and shipbuilding
technology, it has been agreed the following:
- RBI, as public research institute, mainly funded by the state budget, is going to found a
daughter company, Rudjer Innovations (RI), under RBI ownership as the direct participant in the
STP, acting as the Technology Transfer Office of RBI;
- the BI, as state-owned corporation, re-structuring agenda was agreed, with precondition of
stable state subsidy.

A Mid-term review of the Project conducted during 2008, led to the Project‟s restructuring which
was approved in July 2009 by the WB Board. The Project‟s focus was shifted from the
restructuring of RDIs to the objectives of enabling the commercialization of public research and
fostering private sector R&D. These aims reflected more accurately what could be achieved with
the available funds and given the prevailing institutional conditions and legal framework for in
the country. It was agreed on that the precondition for further progress towards the objective of
restructuring public RDIs was legislation change, in order to impose better governance within
RDI‟s and in order to implement the output-based funding. On the other side results achieved in
commercialization of publicly funded research and the generated spillover effects surpassed
original expectations.

The Project implementation was extended until May 31, 2011, due to accumulated delays in the
beginning of the Project, the restructuring undertaken at Mid-term, and to allow for capacity
growth of the later-included PAs, which were non-existent at Project outset.

2. Project Management

The overall responsibility for implementation and coordination of the Project was delegated by
the Government of Croatia to the MSES. The Project management structure included a
professional independent Project Management Unit (PMU) responsible for day-to-day project
management on behalf of the MSES, as defined in a formal Delegation of Authority. These
responsibilities included project management, procurement, disbursement, financial
management, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) for the entire project. The PMU reported to
a State Secretary (later Director of the Science Directorate), nominated as Project Coordinator.
The PMU consisted of a Director, Financial Expert, and Procurement Expert (initially engaged at
50% work time, later two full-time consultants as the volume of procurement grew). A Project
Council, consisting of the Project Coordinator, PMU, Directors of the PAs and a representative
of the MoF, was held annually when project-wide issues were discussed. Issues were also
discussed with all stakeholders at the annual Joint Portfolio Reviews (JPRs) held at the MoF.

On the WB side, the Task Team was led by a Task Team Leader (TTL), with permanent support
from finance and procurement specialists. Other experts were consulted on an as-needed basis
(mostly concerning RDI issues, and later focusing on M&E). Mutual obligations and
responsibilities were setup through a three-tier set of legal documents: following the Loan
Agreement, Project Agreements (PAs) were signed between the WB and PAs (BI and BICRO),
and Subsidiary Financial Agreements (SFAs) regulated financial obligations of the PAs (BI, RBI
and BICRO) towards the Government (represented by both the MoF and MSES).

The PAs were given responsibility for implementation of the activities related to their
components. The implementation was organized on the basis of annual Business Plans, which
required prior approval by both MSES and WB. The UKF Program, as a fund with no legal
entity to support it, was operated by consultants directly from the MSES with logistic support
from BICRO.

The comprehensive set of project documents created prior to effectiveness, including the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) and Project Implementation Plan (PIP) provided a general
framework for project implementation, defining Project Management responsibilities (as outlined
above), costs and financing, procurement and financial management arrangements, M&E
procedures, down to pre-agreed formats for reporting and drafting Terms of Reference (TORs)
for tenders. The Operational Manual was revised during implementation, whereby the
PMU/MSES and TT/WB jointly addressed procedural issues and provided guidelines for them.

The funds-flow agreement included an understanding on the usage of both Bank funds and
counterpart funding from the State budget. A Special account was opened for the duration of the
project in a commercial bank, and managed by the PMU. The PAs were provided funding
according to annual procurement plans, which passed approval both from the MSES and WB.
Procurement for the Project was carried out in accordance with the WB‟s “Guidelines:
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits?, and “Guidelines: Selection and Employment
of Consultants by WB Borrowers?. Guidelines for Sub-Financing (SF) and Innovation Financing
(IF) categories were set in the Operational Manual. Supervision of the goods and services under
SF/IF was delegated to BICRO/UKF/RI, respectively, as the implementing agencies.



                                              48
Overall responsibility for financial management issues was assigned to the PMU, whose
fiduciary responsibilities included ensuring that project activities were carried out in accordance
with agreed project objectives and performance targets. Disbursement was based on
replenishment of the Special Account or occasional direct payments. A Financial Management
System (software) was procured at the outset, and utilized throughout the Project life. FMRs
were issued quarterly as well as the reports on used STP funds for each PA. Financial statements
of the Project, as well as individual PAs, were audited annually by an Independent Auditor,
approved by the WB. STP and individual PAs were also occasionally supervised by the MSES
internal audit, and MoF. Regular procurement and financial supervisions were conducted by WB
procurement and financial experts and the State Audit. M&E arrangements were outlined in the
PIP, and an early set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) was established. During Project
implementation the KPI monitoring was significantly enhanced, following expert input and
empirical knowledge gained.

3. Key Stakeholders

The Ministry of Science, Education and Sports (MSES) acted as the main project beneficiary
and had overall responsibility for implementation of the STP.

The MSES is also the central authority in charge of implementing the National Innovation
System (NIS), comprising activities and instruments for fostering the development of Croatia as
a knowledge-intensive economy, based on innovation. The NIS supports whole innovation cycle,
from basic research, technology transfer from RDI‟s to the private sector, stimulating
innovations in the private sector, and improved positioning of the national economy in view of
the expected EU-accession in the near future.

The MSES provided direct support for the Unity through Knowledge Fund (UKF). This
program was aimed at: (i) encouraging Croatian scientists and professionals working abroad
(Diaspora) to connect with local scientists; (ii) fostering Croatian institutions and researchers to
utilize potentials of the Croatian scientific and professional Diaspora. UKF‟s mission remains to
unify the scientific and professional potentials in Croatia and the Diaspora for the development
of a society based on knowledge. In order to achieve this task, UKF set the following goals:
fostering internationally competitive research, research that provides added values to the
Croatian economy and supporting the projects that develop research infrastructure. The projects
financed by UKF were chosen on a competitive basis through an unbiased peer-review process
based on excellence.

Rudjer Boskovic Institute (RBI) is the largest Croatian research institute, owned by the
Government of Croatia. The fields of activities of the divisions are primarily in basic and applied
research in natural sciences (physics, chemistry, and biology), but also in oceanography,
biomedicine, genetics and computing. RBI was founded in 1950 in Zagreb, as a center for
advanced scientific research, with oceanographic facilities in Rovinj. From its inception, RBI has
been dedicated to fundamental research. In parallel, RBI has engaged in a limited amount of
applied research, jointly with industrial companies, both within Croatia and internationally,
collaborating with other institutes and industries, and cooperating with governmental institutions



                                                49
related to national defense, health care, food production and environmental protection.
Additionally, RBI offers expert advice and serves as a quality control reference for some
products, standards and measures. RBI has a well-organized infrastructure, which includes a
computing center, animal facilities and a large number of valuable experimental devices
(Tandem Van der Graaff, EPR, X-ray and NMR, core facility for molecular genetics, MS, IR,
Raman spectrometers, a cyclotrone, PET-camera etc), which were further enhanced through
procurement under STP. The Institute has over 900 employees with over 500 PhD researchers.

In terms of high science and innovative capacity, RBI is a national asset. RBI could contribute
tremendously towards elevating the scientific and technological content of Croatian industry by
focusing its scientific talent to creating technological advancement, while maintaining its
scientific excellence. A preliminary review of RBI by international scientific experts confirmed
that the quality of research across a range of areas has been maintained at a high level and
outputs in these fields have the potential for technological breakthroughs and commercial
applications.

The Agency for Innovation and Technology Transfer of the RBI, Rudjer Innovations (RI), was
registered as a limited-liability company in 2007, for the purpose of protection and placement of
the know-how, innovations, patents, technology transfer, incorporation of spin-off and joint-
venture companies and connecting RBI with other scientific, technological or industrial entities
at home and abroad, aiming at production of new technological high-value products that are
competitive in the world market. The mission of RI is to be the main facilitator in connecting
scientific institutions in Croatia (primarily RBI) with financial and investment entities at home
and abroad.

Brodarski Institute (BI) was founded in 1948 as an R&D institution of special interest to the
Republic of Croatia in the field of marine industry, science and technical systems. Between 1991
and 1993 BI was transformed from a budgetary financed institution into a limited liability
company fully owned by the Government. Since then BI has been financed from commercial
contracts with both the public and private sector. During the 90-ies BI significantly reduced
operating costs as well as non-marketable activities. Knowledge acquired in defense related work
was directed towards development of R&D projects for the needs of the national market. Over
this period the number of employees was reduced from 450 (in 1991) to 160.

Among the 7 public universities in Croatia, the University of Zagreb (UoZ) is the largest in
every aspect. With its 63,000 students studying for Bachelor and Masters Degrees, as well as
2,000 PhD students, 5,500 members of academic staff, and 8,000 employees distributed in 29
faculties, 3 academies and 1 University center. University of Zagreb, as the backbone of Croatia
research system, in the field of natural sciences, biomedicine and several areas of engineering
and applied biosciences provide significant potential for innovation and technology transfer. The
establishment of the UoZ Technology Transfer Office (UoZ TTO) in 2008 was the first
necessary step towards improving IP protection and technology transfer. The TTO was created as
a university infrastructure that serves to promote development and commercialization of
innovations and discoveries resulting from scientific research conducted at the UoZ.




                                               50
The University of Rijeka (UoR) is situated in the coastal industrial city of Rijeka, with several
faculties located in neighboring towns. Like other Croatian public universities, it is a state-
funded institution. With its 17000 students, 1000 researchers, 250 PhD students, 350 academic
staff, and a total of 1600 employees, it provides a sound research base. The University of Rijeka
Technology Transfer Office (UoR TTO) was founded in 2008. Its mission is to extract fair
market value of the University's intellectual property and stimulate creation of future
commercially viable IP, using best business practices for the benefit of the University and the
community.

The Business Innovation Centre of Croatia (BICRO) is an innovation and investment limited
liability company established by the Croatian Government in 1998, with the goal to facilitate
technology transfer and commercialization activities primarily in the sector of technology driven
small and medium-sized (SMEs) companies, contribute to the creation and development of a
private equity industry, and promote the establishment and development of science and
technology parks/centers and related institutions. The primary objective of BICRO is to promote
the competitiveness of Croatian industry and the service sector by assisting in the creation of
world-class technology and technological know-how. This objective is pursued through the
following programs:
The RAZUM Program (Development of knowledge-based companies) is a seed capital
program and its focus is on co-financing development costs of new products. It offers financial
support to technologically advanced firms based on knowledge, where the level of technological
innovation, quality of management, commercial potential, competitive advantages and quality of
the Business plan are assessed through a transparent pre-determined procedure.
The Research and Development Program (IRCRO) aims at encouraging SMEs to engage in
R&D. The program envisages utilization of extensive facilities available within the universities
and other independent technology institutions in the country. Each project under the IRCRO
Program involves cooperation between an industrial firm and an RDI. The resulting project is
carried out together with the RDI and is jointly funded by BICRO and the company, through a
matching-grant scheme.
The Technology Infrastructure Development (TehCRO) program is focused on developing
efficient and self-sustaining technology transfer facilities and business support infrastructure to
meet the needs of private entrepreneurs, as well as researchers and academia. The Program
provides 3-5 years financing to projects aimed at the establishment, upgrading and/or
development of Technology Business Centers, Technology Incubators and Science &
Technology Parks.
Researchers from Croatia's universities and research institutes, as well as entrepreneurs, can
receive funding to turn their ideas into a global business with the help of the Proof of Concept
Grant Fund (PoC). This Fund is administered by the network located at the Universities of
Zagreb, Split, Rijeka and Osijek, as well as in Varaždin and Čakovec techno-parks, with BICRO
responsible for the selection process and financing.

4. Assessment of operation’s objective, design, implementation and operational experience

The role of the STP in last several years‟ development of Croatian R&D system has been very
significant. Generally, the STP acted as an important catalyzer for structuring and improvement


                                                51
of the Croatian national innovation system, as a precondition for increasing research and
development (R&D) activities, as a basis for high technology and innovation-based economic
development, both in private and public sector. It helped creation of an infrastructure for
increasing the level and quality of commercialization processes at universities, institutes and
private companies.

The STP programs triggered investments from EU pre-accession programs in R&D sector.;
improvement of technology transfer process and intellectual property protection on research
institutions and increasing of awareness of the importance of research commercialization for
economic development.

The STP acted as a valuable and complementary instrument for implementation of national
research and technology policy. The Project has proved itself as an essential facility over the last
5 years for strengthening of included R&D institutions and SME‟s who received financing as end
beneficiaries, their increased orientation towards commercialization of research.

However, the PAs participating were very diverse, because of the various starting position and
framework of each PA: RBI as the largest public RDI in the country, BI as a company of applied
technology orientation surviving on the market with little public funding, BICRO - a newly
formed state agency for financing technology-oriented SMEs, the Unity through Knowledge
Fund created as a Ministry‟s program for supporting excellent researchers‟ international
cooperation, and the newly formed TTOs at the University of Zagreb and at the University of
Rijeka, which joined during the implementation. The Project was heavily dealing with institution
building, with raising awareness of the importance of intellectual property protection and
knowledge and technology transfer to the private sector.

As previously explained, the revised Development Objective (DO) was to enable RDIs to
commercialize research outputs, as well as to increase the ability of enterprises,
particularly SMEs, to invest in R&D activities. The need for revision of DO indicates that
initial goals have been set not taking into account boundaries of overall legal framework of
Croatian public sector. The built-in flexibility allowed for Project restructuring during
implementation: based on lessons learned some goals were changed, restructuring of public
institutions was abandoned, and more emphasis was placed on technology transfer and
commercialization of knowledge. Some components that could not be launched due to objective
circumstances were cancelled (the Venture Capital Fund prepared by BICRO, due to lack of
available funding coinciding with the global crisis reflecting on Croatian economic and fiscal
situation).

The WB was justified in postponing the Effectiveness date pending on the adoption of the
Science and Technology Policy for the Republic of Croatia 2006-2010 (S&T Policy). The
document provided a valuable framework for the implementation of the Project. The S&T
Policy was a strategic document stating goals and instruments in the mid-term period. The S&T
Policy's overall aim was to stimulate scientific excellence and enable the transfer of knowledge
and results of scientific discoveries to industry and business, in order to increase competitiveness
and generate sustainable growth and productivity. The document listed a set of specific
objectives for promoting business innovation and technology development. It included a brief



                                                52
analysis of how the objectives were to be met, including a Policy Matrix where policy measures
aimed at encouraging science and industry cooperation were related to strategic objectives,
critical challenges, and target groups, followed by policy measures linked to groups responsible
for their implementation. The Action Plan: Science and Technology Policy of the Republic of
Croatia 2007-2010 (Action Plan), was adopted by the Croatian Government on April 18, 2008.
The Action Plan built on a basic gap analysis of the prevailing NIS challenges, set progress
indicators for monitoring R&D supply and absorption capacity and demand, and listed priority
actions for individual Policy elements including: improving the legislative framework, educating
the S&T community towards commercial exploitation of R&D, improving financing of the S&T
sector, facilitation of innovation-based start-ups, integration with the EU and international
environment and intensifying R&D in industry.

The biggest lesson learned during Project implementation was that it is easier to undertake
institution building, rather than reforming existing institutions, due to the limited timeframe of
implementation. The key factor for success remain high-skilled people: dedicated experienced
professionals with appropriate additional training.

The ultimate factor underlying implementation success remains the prolonged preparation,
governance setup and overall design of this very complex Project.

The described setup and acquired implementation experience enabled total disbursement above
99% of the available funds, in line with the Project development objectives, and under strict
enforcement of all applicable operational procedures.

5. Assessment of the outcome of the implementation against agreed objectives

The most important outcomes achieved during STP implementation are as follows:
Rudjer Innovations, the commercialization agency of RBI, concluded 12 licensing agreements
valued at over 750,000 EUR, with customers including prestigious institutions such as MIT and
Brown University; five patents were granted and 37 patent applications were filed. Five spin-off
(science-based) companies were launched (eight planned) surpassing the target set for market
value generated, of which two are already self-sustainable and one (RMC) promising even higher
returns in the near future. Several other potential spin-offs are under development in the pre-
commercial phase. Despite numerous activities aimed at enhancing the commercialization of
research, including adoption of an IP Policy, the industry/business sector is still not fully aware
of the existing innovation potential at RBI, leaving space for future improvement.

Brodarski Institute concluded 41 research and service contracts with industry valued at 9
MEUR, and increased its share of revenue from the private sector to 45% at project closure
(compared to a baseline of 22% in 2006). STP funds were utilized to enhance facilities with
proven market potential and upgrade infrastructure in the core hydrodynamics laboratories.

BICRO directly supported 89 SMEs qualified for its programs through the rigorous application
process. The STP, specifically, through its component of supporting R&D in private companies,
has helped to restructuring and developing Croatian innovation agency – BICRO. The RAZUM
program for development of knowledge-based companies approved 31 projects for funding (out



                                                53
of 135 applications received) and contracted 22 projects, with a total value of 21.9 million Euros
- 66% of that financed by the Project funds and 34% directly contributed by the private sector.
Those companies employ a total of 576 people, and their total income in 2010 was 33.83 million
Euros. SPREAD/IRCRO, program for supporting cooperation between SME‟s and public
research institutions financed in total 17 cooperative projects and attracted 1.35 EUR of private
funding per 1 EUR of public funding provided. The Proof-of-Innovative-Concept program
supported 46 projects with a total value of 1.86 million Euros - 34% is contributed by the private
sector. The projects generated 29 patent applications, 19 technical feasibility demonstrations and
40 prototypes. Finally, the technology infrastructure development program TEHCRO financed
totally 12 projects, with a total value of 8.93 million EUR, where 1 EUR invested attracted 1.43
EUR from other funding sources. In 2010 there were a total of 52 high-tech companies housed
within 6 incubator centers, employing a total of 494 people, and 217 new jobs were created in
tenant companies between the years 2008 – 2010. Participation of BICRO in the STP was a key
reason that BICRO is successfully benefited from the IPA-funded project (16 million EUR) of
building a new biotechnology incubator BioCentar.

While difficult to single-out any particular success story, the MariBIC Center of Excellence for
mariculture providing services to the traditional Ston bay fish and shellfish hatcheries promises
interesting developments, both due to its unique position and natural resources, solid scientific
base and prudent oversight provided by BICRO.

The UKF facility financed 91 projects (target: 50), of which 59 successfully concluded by STP
closing date. Of these, 28 contracts were with industry estimated at 2.7MEUR, and attracting
further investments of 650 KEUR from the partners. The cooperative projects with foreign RDIs
attracted 1.1 MEUR of additional investments. The target set for the number and value of
contracts was easily exceeded. 544 researchers participating in the UKF program from over 100
public research organizations (70 from abroad) published 180 articles in the most prestigious
international scientific journals. Another unpredicted spillover effect was the high success-rate of
the UKF projects which went on to apply for highly competitive 7th Framework Programme
funding (30% compared to the national average of 16%), bringing additional funding valued at
6.9 MEUR to domestic researchers.

The historical lack of „patenting culture‟ and reluctance to academic entrepreneurship among
university researchers was challenged by the establishment of the University of Zagreb TTO in
2008. The University Senate accepted in 2008 an IPR Policy, which was the first of its kind in
Croatia, denoting a significant paradigm shift among University researchers. The UoZ TTO
achieved 8 patent filings and 18 IP transfers within its 2 years involvement on the Project. More
significantly, it set a standard of highly trained individuals who were quick to embark on EU-
funded projects, thus creating a realistic basis for future self-sustainability.

Due to its late start in the STP, the University of Rijeka achieved limited results. However, the
IP protection culture has been implanted, and IP Policy and Rulebook adopted by the University
Senate in 2010.

Altogether, within the STP, three major Croatian academic institutions established the fully
functional technology transfer offices (Institute Rudjer Boskovic, University of Zagreb and



                                                54
University of Rijeka), and introduced best practices in technology transfer previously missing in
Croatia. All three institutions, because of the experiences achieved through implementation of
the Project, were successful in obtaining projects for further development of technology transfer
from the Science and Innovation Investment Fund (near 1 million Euros), which is activity under
IPA Regional Development Program.

At the end of STP the Zagreb Institute of Economics made an independent evaluation of the
impact of RAZUM, IRCRO and UKF programs, supported under STP. Among others, the
assessment showed that the STP programs RAZUM and SPREAD have enabled companies to
invest more in R&D, and helped them carry out more innovative projects and in a shorter period
of time (the “additionality,? as opposed to “full substitution? effect). From 2006 to 2008, the
share of Croatian SMEs that have new or significantly improved products new to the market
raised from 7.2 percent to 10.8 percent (EU Community Innovation Survey).

6. Evaluation of the Borrower’s and Bank’s performance

The STP was primarily an institution-building experience, resulting in the development of the
National Innovation System. Looking back after Project completion on May 31, 2011, it is safe
to say that the STP has profoundly influenced all the involved institutions, achieving
unprecedented institution-building and capacity growth, most visibly highlighted in BICRO‟s
achievements. Setting up RI and the TTO at the University of Zagreb has changed the way
technology transfer is conducted in Croatian research institutions, and the UKF operation have
set-up new standard for transparent competitive grant schemes in the R&D sector. Moreover, the
STP influenced numerous SME partners from the private sector (confirmed by an in-depth study
performed towards the end of the Project by the Economics Institute), and has set managerial and
financial-control standards which remain a firm reference for future projects. The PAs supported
form the core of the NIS, whose framework was defined and enhanced during the Project
implementation, making it the most advanced in the region.

The MSES as the Project‟s initiator and implementation entity had the vision of Project‟s goals
which had to be achieved. The complexity of the Project involving many different stakeholders /
project agencies (institutes, companies, entities within universities and the Ministry) was a big
challenge and required intensive coordination and cooperation. The Project Management Unit
(PMU) was the right solution to over-bridge numerous expectations from the Project Agencies
and to steer them, with the MSES‟s support, towards the Project‟s goals. The STP Steering
Committee significantly contributed to identifying the problems, finding solutions and focusing
to the main goals. However, there is always space for improvements in the area of Project
Agencies‟ understanding WB procedures, efficient responses to the MSES‟s, WB‟s and PMU‟s
requests and requirements, getting all entities informed on relevant issues within PA‟s etc.

The World Bank had very important and positive role as partner, controller and advisor in the
Project implementation. It contributed in project designing, budgeting, defining the measurable
project indicators, setting proper procedures etc. WB shared international experiences in the
similar projects, intermediate with the relevant international institutions and provided relevant
resources regarding bench marking. There is still room for improvement the efficiency of
response to the problem resolution in the everyday running of the Project, because of its



                                               55
complexity and in the communication with Project Agencies. As suggested by the Bank, the
Project allowed certain autonomy of the Project Agencies. However, this left insufficient space
for later interventions of MSES as the actual responsible body.

7. Proposed arrangements for future operation of the Project Agencies

The critical issue following successful implementation of STP remains the lack of available
funding within the country, due to fiscal constraints, for stimulating research, development and
innovation commercialization across the public and private sectors. Currently only 0.7% of the
GDP is invested in R&D (compared to 1.2% several years ago when the Project was starting.
Since EU-accession can now realistically be planned at mid-2013, the biggest short-term danger
lies in a lack of funding over the following 2-3 year period for the NIS and its key institutions.

Besides setting up National Innovation Policy, legislative customization in science and research,
R&D tax incentives and other initiatives, the Croatian Government is strongly committed to
continue the positive trends in innovation and technology transfer development by promoting
usage of EU pre-accession funds. R&D Policy is one of the priorities in the Government
Economic Recovery Program.

STP also contributed to increase the capacity of Croatia‟s institutions to absorb EU pre-accession
funds and prepare for a better use of EU structural funds in the future. MSES has designed IPA-
financed Science and Innovation Investment Fund (6 MEUR) for technology transfer based on
STP model. BICRO was awarded 18 MEUR from EU IPA (Instrument for Pre-Accession
Assistance) for a Biotechnology Incubation Center (project preparation funded by STP). By
increasing the participation of local researchers in FP7, UKF program contributed to further
integrating Croatia‟s research to the European Research Area (ERA).

There have been extensive contacts between the MSES and MoF from the Croatian Government
side and high-level WB officials, regarding the launch of a “repeater project? which could
smooth the transition and prepare key institutions within the Croatian NIS for absorption of EU
funding.

RBI, in partnership with the University of Rijeka, is currently participating in an IPA project to
promote continuing education in the area of IP, stronger support in evaluation of IP and its
protection, as well as providing support in the process of negotiating contracts with
industry/business, creating a database of scientific infrastructure and expertise, in order to
provide both RBI researchers and partners from the industrial/business sector better insight into
the potential in scientific research, measurements and other available services.

The sustainability of RI and is functions became unquestionable by RBI management, which is
currently implementing institutional restructuring process of whole institution, in order to reach
higher competitiveness of research performance and technology transfer.

Projects and services in the marine technology sector are influenced by the global crisis and the
situation is the same in the shipbuilding industry. BI has recognized this volatility and has
successfully switched marketing and sales activities to international markets. Projects in the

advanced technologies sector show promise, especially expertise gained in Municipal Waste
Management. The BI group for EU projects is currently engaged in four contracted FP7 projects
(with leader status in two of them). The ultimate goal is to transform BI into the leading Croatian
RTO organization in the field of advanced technology and applied sciences, thus setting the
foundation for long-term sustainability.

BICRO has undertaken organizational changes converting its legal status to a Government
Agency in 2010 and in parallel assumed a role in programming and implementation of future EU
structural funds in the area of innovation and technology, on behalf of the MSES. However, EU
funds shall become available in 2013, leaving uncertainty in funding for the transition period.
Through the involvement in Pre, BICRO secured an 18 MEUR investment for establishing a
biosciences innovation and commercialization center (BIOCenter), as an important part of the
research and business infrastructure for the build-up of the biotechnology sector in Croatia, from
the IPA fund.

The UoZ TTO has achieved significant results during its short lifespan. A strong procedural
framework has been established for IPR. A framework for knowledge exchange and spinout is
still under development and making strong progress. The fund raising and support to University
management function has been successfully developed. Currently funding is available from the
TEMPUS OPUS project, and under 2 IPA/SIIF projects; the latter is financing technology and
expertise mapping. A strategic roadmap discussing short-to mid-long term activities concerning
sustainability has been developed.

UKF sustainability was considered high-risk from the outset, due to the ad-hoc institutional
setup as a MSES program. But UKF undisputed success makes the good foundation for securing
future funding from budgetary resources and FP7 projects.
