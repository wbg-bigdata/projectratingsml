to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.
2.
Except as the Administrator shall otherwise agree, payments out of the Special 
Account shall be made exclusively for Eligible Expenditures in accordance with the 
provisions of this Schedule.
3.
After the Administrator has received evidence satisfactory to the Administrator 
that the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized 
Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the Special Account may be made as 
follows:
(a)
On the basis of a request or requests by the Grantee for a deposit or 
deposits which add up to the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation, the 
Administrator shall, on behalf of the Grantee, deposit into the Special Account such 
amount or amounts out of the proceeds of the Grant as the Grantee shall have 
requested.
(b)
The Grantee shall furnish to the Administrator requests for replenishment 
of the Special Account at such intervals as the Administrator shall specify. On the 
Page  7
basis of such requests, the Administrator shall deposit into the Special Account such 
amounts out of the proceeds of the Grant as shall be required to replenish the Special 
Account with amounts not exceeding the amount of payments made out of the Special 
Account for Eligible Expenditures. Each such deposit shall be made by the 
Administrator in the respective equivalent amount, as shall have been justified by the 
evidence supporting the request for such deposit furnished pursuant to paragraph 4 of 
this Schedule.
4.
For each payment made by the Grantee out of the Special Account for which the 
Grantee requests replenishment pursuant to paragraph 3 (b) of this Schedule, the 
Grantee shall furnish to the Administrator, prior to or at the time of such request, 
such documents and other evidence as the Administrator shall reasonably request, 
showing that such payment was made for Eligible Expenditures.
5.
(a)
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, no 
further deposit into the Special Account shall be made by the Administrator when 
either of the following situations first arises:
(i)
the Administrator shall have determined that all further 
withdrawals of the Grant proceeds should be made directly to the 
Grantee; or
     (ii)
the total unwithdrawn amount of the Grant shall be equal to the 
equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
(b)
Thereafter, withdrawals of the Grant proceeds remaining unwithdrawn shall 
follow such procedures as the Administrator shall specify by notice to the Grantee. 
Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the 
Administrator shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in 
the Special Account as of the date of such notice have been or will be utilized in 
making payments for Eligible Expenditures.
6.
If the Administrator shall have determined at any time that any payment out of 
the Special Account: (i) was made for any expenditure or in any amount not eligible 
pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence 
furnished pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule, the Grantee shall, promptly upon 
notice from the Administrator, deposit into the Special Account (or, if the 
Administrator shall so request, refund to the Administrator) an amount equal to the 
amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. No further 
deposit by the Administrator into the Special Account shall be made until the Grantee 
has made such deposit or refund.
7.
If the Administrator shall have determined at any time that any amount 
outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for 
Eligible Expenditures, the Grantee shall, promptly upon notice from the Administrator, 
refund to the Administrator such outstanding amount which will be added to the 
unwithdrawn amount of the Grant.
