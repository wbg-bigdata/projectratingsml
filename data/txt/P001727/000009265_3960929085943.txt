MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TIE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALI
FOR A SECOND HEALTH. POPULATION AND RURAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1. The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Republie of Mali for SDR 19.2 million (US$ 26.6 million) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years' maturity and would help finance a Second health, population
and Rural Water Supply project. The project would be cofinanced by the
European Development Fund (EDF) for SDR8.8 (US$12.3 million), United States
Agency for International Development (USAID) for SDR7.2 million (US$10.1
million), the Republic of Germany for SDR4.4 million (US$6.2 million) and the
French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) for SDR1.2 million (US$1.7
million).
2.   Background. With a per capita income of US$230 in 1989, Mali is one of
the poorest countries in the world. Its public heslth services are among the
least developed in terms of access, quality and utilization, and have been
further deteriorating over the past 10 years. The health indicators of the
7.7 million population (1987 Census) compare unfavorably with the sub-Saharan
African averag-¶ the crude death rate is 19.5 per 1,000, over one fourth of
the children d2., before age 5, and lif expectancy at birth is oaly 45 years.
Water-borne diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, as only
352 of the rural and 55% of the urban population have access to a safe and
clean vater supply. Despite the high mortality rates, the crude birth rate
of 49.6 per 1,000 causes the population to increase at 2.7% per year, reduced
to 2.5% by out-migration. The modern contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) is
only 1.2%, due to demand and supply constraints. At the present growth rate,
Mali's population would double in 28 years, making it increasingly difficult
to meet basic needs and improve living conditions, especially if further
reductions in mortality are not accompanied by a fertility decline.
3.        This situation can be explained by a number of factorss  public
funding for health has been declining; drugs have been in short supply, due
to an inefficient monopoly import and distribution system; staff are
demotivated and unsupervised; facility planning and service delivery have
followed a top-down, administrative instead of an active public health
approach.   On the other hand, a large aumber of NGOs or donor-supported
operations, including the first IDA-financed Health Development Project
(Cr.1422-MLI) approved in 1983, have successfully pioneered innovative
approaches such as the provision of essential drugs (EDs), cost-recovery, and
community-based management of health services.
4.        Recogniting its inability to respond to the basic health needs of
the population, the Government is adopting a new approach for the provision
of health and family planning (FP) services that builds on these experiments.
A partnership is being developed between the public sector (at the central
and local levels), NGOs, local communities and private practitioners. The
Government has begun to refoeus its role away from direct service delivery
and has taken far-reaching steps to make EDs available and affordable,
including the opening of a multiple channel Import system, and privatisation

of distribution. The management of health services is being decentralized;
local communities are being assisted to open their own health facilities,
offering integrated services (preventive, curative, FP); and a cost-sharing
system combining an increase in the national recurrent health budget (from
6.6% in 1990 to 9% in'l995), the local development tax and cost-recovery is
being introduced. A Populat'on policy integrating demographic variables into
socioeconomic planning has just been formulated, and a FP strategy has been
adopted, under which an all-out information effort la being launched and FP
is being integrated into maternal and child care.  In rural vater supply,
Mali's policy of moderate expansion of the vater points network, coupled with
systematic maintenance of ex'sting vater points involving villagers'
financial and technical partic.pation, vas successfully supported by the
ongoing Rural Water Supply Project (Cr.1431-MLI and SF7) approved in December
1983.
5.        Rationale for IDA's involvement.  Socioeconomic indicators place
Mali among the f ive lowest ranking countries in the vor;d, making human
resource development a top priority in IDA's country strategy.    Rapid
population growth is also a source of serious concern, gîven the country's
limited natural resource base and harsh environment.  Broadening accesa to
quality, affordable health and PP services vill contribute to achieving
growth, while helping to meet the basic needs of some of the poorest and most
vulnerable groups. This requires drastic sectoral reforms, some of which
(cost-recovery, ED policy) have been initiated under the first IDA-financed
health project. IDA is therefore vell positioned to play a catalytic role in
ensuring that the reforms are carried through, especially as the strategy
developed wvth the Government is being used as a vehicle to coordinate the
sharply increasing donor support. The rural vater supply component will not
only reinforce the impact of the health component, but also cover parts of
Hali which are most deficient in access to safe water and for which external
financing might not be forthcoming.   Finally, the project's emphasis on the
efficient management of public resources, the mobilisation of private
funding, and private sector promotion will contribute importantly to IDA's
macro objectives for Mali.
6.        Prolect objectives.  Through a set of policy/institutional reforms
and investments, the project aime to assist the Government in its efforts to
improve the haalth status of the Malian people, especially women and
children, to bagin implementing its emerging population policy and to improve
access to safe vater for rural communities lacking such access.
7.        Prolect description.  The project comprises thrae components: The
health component vill (a) increase the coverage and quality of health care
directly in four Regions and the capital area of Bamako through the
development of a dacentralized District-based health development program
involving the construction/rehabilitation of about 120 primary and 52
raferral care centers and management strengthening at the District and
Regional levels, as vell as active community, NGO and private sector
participation; and (b). improve the planning and management of the sector's
personnel, physical and financial resources, as vell as the provision of EDs.
The population component vill, countrywide, (a) strengthen the institutions
in charge of implementing the national population policy and of managing FP



programs; and (b) stimulate demand for FP through IEC and increase the
availability and quality of FP services, using a core investment program and
a population fund (POPFUND).   The rural water supply component will (a)
increase the rural population's supply of safe drinking water in the four
project Regions by constructing/rehabilitating about 885 water points; and
(b) implement an iodination program in areas where iodine deficiency is
prevalent. The project, to be carried out over six years, provides funds for
civîl works; vehicles, furniture, equipment and supplies, including drugs and
contraceptives; training and specialist services; a population fund; and
incremental operating costs. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$61.4 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$41.7
million (68%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methode of procurement are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Mali are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is
alseo  attached.      The  Staff  Appraisal  Report,   No.   8683,   dated
Pebruary 22, 1991, is also attached.
8.        Agreed actions. Agreements reached with the Government include the
followings (a) selection of the project-supported Districts and communities
in accordance with the agreed criteria; (b) discussion with IDA of aitudies on
the hospital sub-sector and the labor market for health graduates by
September 30, 1991, for im?lementation vithin six months thereafter; (c)
compliance with agreed indicators to monitor (1) procurement of EDs in
generic form at the most competitive price (as published by UNIPAC), (ii) the
margin applied by the Goverrment's restructured pharmaceutical procurement
agency (PPM), to be agreed with IDA and spec'hfied in a Contrat-Plan between
Government and PPM; and (ILL) availability of the most critical EDs at the
District level; (c) an annual Government-IDA review of the draft investment
budget and three-year rolling inv«tment program of the Health Ministry
(MSPAS); (d) the signing of contracts between villages and the National Rural
Water Supply Directorate and payment of villagers' cash contribution (US$400)
prior to arrival of the borehole siting team; (e) for the Project
Coordination Unit, employment of key personnel with. qualifications and
experience acceptable to IDA; and (f) organization, by November 30 of each
year beginning in 1991, of an annual joint Government-IDA review of project
implementation.   Effectiveness will be conditional upon (a) signing between
the Government and PPM of a Contrat-Plan satisfactory to IDA; (b) the signing
of the grant agreements with the EDF and with USAID; and (c) issuance of new
drug  import  regulations.    Disbursements  against  the POPFUND will be
conditional upon (a) creation of the National Bureau for Coordination of
Population activities; and (b) establishment of management and staffing
arrangements fully satisfactory to IDA.
9.        Benefits.  The health component has been designed to provide by
1997 accesa to quality health services for about 312 of Malils population.
For this target population, quantified health-care indicators have been
defined and will be monitored. Improvements in the planning and management
of sectoral resources will also benef it the ontire country, allowing further
expansion of the District-based health system. The population component aims
to increase the modern CPR from 1.2 to 8.5% countrywide and to 10% In the
Regions of project concentration by 1997; by that date, about 75% of urban



women and half of rural women will be fully informed about the existence,
availability and benefits of modern contraceptive methods. The water supply
component will provide access to a source of safe water for about 180,000
people and will eliminate iodine deficiency among a population of 240,000,
one third of whom suffer from goiter.
10.       Risks.  Possible riska include slow tmplementation of the proposed
phaimaceutical reform; slower than expected changes in health personnel
attitudes;   insufficient   institutional   coordination;   and   possible
disappointing results of the community sensitization and participation effort
(including cost-recovery performance).   These riska are expected to be
minimized by the gradual development of alternative, well-regulated sources
of drug supply; the Goverrment's strong comn itment to decentralization; and
the project design, which provides for carefully phased and monitored
implementation based on a clearly defined but flexible institutional and
financing framework.
11.       Recommendation.    I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
