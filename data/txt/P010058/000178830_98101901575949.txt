SIuPEARY
i.        The! Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC) was established
by legislation in 1955, folloving the recommendation of a Bank survey mission
in 1951. It is empowered to carry on the usual finctions of a development
finance company. The Bank made a loan of $4 million to DF°C in November 1967.
ii.       DFCCts share capital of Rs. 8 million is presently held 39.5% by
private domestic investors, 35.5% by foreign investors and 25% by Government-
owned institutions, including the Bank of Ceylon, which is the largest single
shareholder.
iii.      Other than the Bank loan, DFCC's resources comprise a subordinated
Government loan of Rs. 16 million, refinancing from the Central Bank and a
borrowing facility from the Bank of Ceylon, presently unused. Total resources
amounted to Rs. 64.5 million equivalent as of March 31, 1969.
iv.       DFCC's nine-member Board makes all investment decisions and guides its
policies, which have been appropriate. DFCCts chief executive is its General
Manager.  Since December 1967 DFCC has had an Advisor to its Board and management.
v.        From July 1. 1969. DFCC's General Manager wil:L be Mr. C. Loganathan,
an aggressive and experienced banker well known to the ]3ank. Although DFCC's
staff has been increased, further recruitment will be necessarv to cone with
the rapid growth of DFCC's business.
vi.       DFCCts lending operations have increased significantly since it
obtained the first Bnnk loan.   That followed improYvements in +he Geylo e-n C-rnOm%r
a rapid rise in industrial production, and the introduction of monetary reforms

with debt recovery. DFCC's pre-tax income in fiscal years 1967, 1968 and 1969
was 18, 1:-9 and 1o.1% of average equit-y respectively.    neserves are adequate.
VLLL.     Considering the amount oI iinancing applications under or awaiting
examination, DFCC is likely to be able to commit in foreign exchange an amount
of between Rs. 65 and 70 million in fiscal years 1970 and 19T1. Tne correspond-
ing estimates for rupee lending and share investment commitments are Rs. :31



- ii -
million and Rls. 7 million, respectively. DFCC will need about $8 million,, in
addition to funds in hand or in sight, (a proposed loan from KfW,) to meelt its
estLmated foreign currency loan commitments over the two-year period.
ix.       DFC3C is a suitable recipient of a second Bank loan.  The proposed loan
should be on the Bank's usual terms for recent loans to development finance
companies. All subprojects needing Bank finance in excess of $100,000 each
shoald require the Bank's prior approval.
x.        On the basis of estimates of operations and resources likely to be
av2ilahlej MCC's assets and portfolio are both e_e_pted to increase substantiali.y
during the next two years. Its profitability in relation to net worth should
increase. iteserves as a prportion of outstandina port;folio are nrojected to
decline unti:L fiscal year 1971 , and DFCC has been urgedl to minimize that decline.
DFOC proposes to increase its share capital as early as practicable, in view of
the prospective increase in the size of both individual and aggregate operations.

DvMOPEWRMT FINBANCE COFT-GRATION OFr--C^YLuN
Introduction
1.        In 191 a Bank general survey mission recommended the establishment of
three institutions to accelerate the economic development of Ceylon, one of the-em a
private developmnent finance company.  Subsequently, the Bank provided advice and
technical assistance in the formation in 1955 of such a company, the Development
Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC). In its early years, DFCC did not need any
loan, and for about four years from 1961, Ceylon's economic policies precluded any
lending by the ]ank or IDA in the country. During that period, in 1963, DFCC asked
the Bank to consider a loan, but the request wa; not then pursued.
2.        The request was revived in 1965, following the election of a new Govern-
ment and the establishment by it of conditions considered favorable for Bank
operations in Ceylon. DFCC was appraised in late 1965. The Government and DIFCC
thereafter took steps to reorganize and strengthen the Corporation, by appropriately
amending its charter, reducing the Government-held portion of DFCC's share capital,
adopting a policy statement and appointing an Advisor to DFCC's management. In
.Aovember 1967 the Bank approved a loan of $4 million to DFCC. As of June 30
1969, $2.32 million of the loan had been committed. A mission visited Cevlon in
early 1969 to appraise DFCC for a further Sank loan, negotiations for wfhich wrere
held in June.
I.  THE ENVIROTMENT
3.        The economy has made substantial progress since 1965.  This is described
i-n t.he Pn.-d  roIs i+t recent econ. omni report enti-,tle d-.- 1-1 11'iiY-ra+. "ur -nntTnin PoititArm and
Prospects of Ceylon" (in two volumes), No. SA-2a dated February 7. The rate of
no-rTj.h of +.the (rP accelerated +-n o7r 8%  , 1Q6J.  Th. rlvRrnrmt-nmt has marie a number
of desirable changes in policy since 1965. Most notable have been the 50%
reductio. ir. the subsidized rice ration in late 1966, and the devaluation of
liovember 1967 followed by the exchange reform of May 1968.
Industrial Deve-lopment
4.        There has been a rapid increase in industrial output both in the public
and pri-vat-e sectors. Lo Ulm extoe .nt thIaLU tLhe OLJa..L V.L 1iCLl 4fL.LI ULtuAc.LlA LAL UiLJr 4D A iAs-
from 8% to 12% between 1965 and 1968. In 1968 the gain in industrial production
was pheinomenA, -viz. arl eU nimUad 4i,)a  Then uui.k Uo U'"e fijcCdea  W.Os thLIW  lt of
fuller use of excisting capacity.
5.        Among the existing factors supporting the above development were the
Governmentis genlerous incentives to industrial investment, and the considerable
administrative restrictions on imports. The more immediate reasons were increased



- 2 -
allocations of foreign exchange for industrial purposes (including the provision,
for the first time in three years, of $10 million to private sector industry for
importing capital goods), the possibility of larger imports of industrial rawT
materials and certain types of machinery, on which import controls were elimJnated
following the eKchange reform of May 1968, and the running down of stocks. The new,
procedures require, however, the payment of a premium for purchasing the exchange.-Y
As a partial o:ffset. import duties on most raw materials were reduced and the 10%o
import license fee abolished. Recipients of foreign currency loans from DFCCt have
been exempted from payment of the premium on exchange, but; are subject to a 20%
license fee, thus giving them a price advantage over thoseb who have to imporlt
against FEEC's.
6.        Profit,hility in private indiuistry in Ceylon- has heen generally hign; and
in certain branches very high, with the acute scarcity of manufactured goods and
the existence of a sellers' mrket.   men where there are seve-ral nrodiicers of a
similar product, the previous shortage of imported raw materials in effect meant
the sharing of the ma Drkcet at low outputs.  The recent liberalization of imports of
production materials should create an element of competition in many fields, since

7.        The upsurge in industry was partly the result of pent up demand, but more
stable growth trends are erieging. The increase in the general level of inc.mes
has created a strong demand for a wider variety of consumer goods.
Government Policies and Practice
8.        Since a policy paper in mid 1966, inviting private foreign investment in
a wide range of industries, the Government has not made any policy prono-unlcelinernts
on industry, e.g. on its attitude towards the private sector and on the criteria
for approving creation of new capacity. In the past the Government was inhibited
from doing so partly because of the stringent rationing oi foreign exchange, but is
less likely to be so in the future, with the recent steps towards a more realistic
exchange rate and a more liberal import policy.  Moreover, despite the lack of
definite statements, the Governmentis practices have been generating confidence
among entrepreneurs. Bccept for a proposed fertilizer plant, the other projects
1/ The Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate (FEEC) Scheme was a measure of
selective devaluation. Certificates are issued against exports of "non-traditional"
products and certain inward remittances; these "earned" certificates are supple-
mented by the CJentral Bank. Certificates are available for purchase at a premium
(which is presently fixed by the Government at 55%, givingr an effective exchange
rate of US$1 = Rs. 9.22), and can in turn be used to obtain foreign exchange for
certain specified purposes.



contiplCLLd nv J-t  jLhe pubLic sector are a.l expansions of existing concerrs.  e
previous imbalance in the growth of the public and private sectors is being
gradually redr-esed.  In 1966 the uovernment decided to al]ow new private sector
investments in textiles.  The production of new products is going ahead in the
private rather thar public sector.
9.        Tne Development Division of the lviinistry of Industry and Fisheries
(whiich is responsible for approving individual projects requiring foreign exchange,
and registering other projects) has had certain formal guidlelines for the selection
of projects, listing "saturated" areas and fields of priority, such as agricultural
processing, products using local raw materials, textiles, :Light engineering, import
substitution and exports. These guidelines provide some rationale for investment
priorities, but are very broad, and thus open to varying interpretations,
occasionally arbitrary. As a result, the implementation of the Government's policy
has shown inconsistencies. By the time the Government was ready to approve projects
in 1967, after a lapse of almost 31 years, the number of applicants had grown to a
few thousand so that the selection process was of necessity somewhat cursory. When
that backlog had been disposed of, a smaller number of projects was examined towards
the end of 1968, and the Development Division claims to have applied the prescribed
priorities more carefully for large or "strategic" projects. It does not profess
to appraise in any depth the financial or economic viability of projects nor does
it consider this to be its job.
10.       The level of import duties on goods such as those locally manufactured is
not high, usually from 15% to 50%.  Of more effect are administrative controls on
ir.ports, which are widespread. Such controls are used not so much to give
protection to specific products, but as a necessary measure to conserve foreign
exchange. Thus, import tariffs have little relevance to protection or development
of products.  On the other hand, there is an overwhelming need to conserve foreign
exchange, and the Bank has concurred in the Government's policy of fostering
production for the growing domestic market, which is needed to replace imports of
finished goods in areas where domestic nroduction can be reaSoriablv efJficJient.  In
aadition, Ceylon's success in increasing food production has permitted more foreign
exchange to be used for jimports of producer goods, therehv alleviating severe
_______ __                            -_     -  __
shortages of these items.  The recent exchange reform has increased the prices of
imports and thuts redi-ced many nf the distortione which arose out of aPn over-valued
currency. Under these conditions industry should become more competitive and
etficie.nrt,, with m  4M+x1   o  incre.asoingly good ir.dicator of the economic
Justification of industrial projects.
11.       The Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs (which is also responsible
for overall sector allocation. of foreign eXchMnge, and  or approvg     Ip  s
involving foreign collaboration and investment) is drawing up a five-year develop-
ment plan, using a co.mprehersive input-output matrix. Preliminar   indications are
that rapid industrial expansion will be envisaged.
Industrial Investment
12.       Investment activity in manufacturing is gathering momentum in the wake of
the remirkable increases in production, and the availability of foreign exchange.



Statistics on recent gross investment in private industry are not available but, on
the basis of the Government's approvals and other developments, may be very roughly
estimated at Rs. 30-40 ml uion in 1967 and Rs. 70-80 ml l-ion in 1468, with larger
amounts committed.
13.       In 196,7 the group of projects approved by the Government required foreign
exchange totaling $20 million, of which $10 million was financed by rupee purchases
of foreign exchange; DFCC, through its Bank loan, and suppliers' credits were
expected to finance part of the balance. Projects approved in 1968 call for total
investment estimated at about Rs. 220 million ($37 million equivalent of which about
$21 million equivalent is in foreign exchange), most of them with foreign
ccllaboration, indicating that overseas investors are beginning to be attracted.
Seven or eight of those projects (four in textiles) are reLatively large, of more
than Rs. 5 million each. Although some of the projects may fail to materialize,
the above figures suggest a significant expansion of investment in future.
14.       Given the accumulation of investment proposals in the past few years and
the recent changes in the investment climate, the rate of gross private investment
in industry and allied sectors is likely to rise sharply in the near future,
decline thereafter for a year or twvo, anid then probably stabilize when it reaches a
level of around Rs. 150-170 million per annum.
lr.       Hitherto, very strong demand for foreign exchange existed side by side
with large accunulations of runee fuinds.. rendered idl e hyr the ahqpnrt of'
complementary foreign exchange.  According to Government estimates, 70o to 75'%0 of
the industrial pro iPnts approved in 1967 needie rnl-r fWroigcn exchange, and their
sponsors had rupee funds with which to buy the exchange. lIowever, that situation
is ehangingr.  The availabilit   of forergn excange for purchase a     t         has
been partly meeting the demand for foreign exchange per se.   Rupee funds are bleing
br-ought into proiducti= use.  Wi   increLased production, the, working capital  eeds
of industry are rising, thus reducing thie quantum of self-generated funds, which
were partly ussed to fin.ace f.eOId asset.  1lI-.4s 4the d,z.  forL XL Le f. l   :Fr.

Tinancing and Institutions
16.       Self financing has been predominant in private industry.   Evidently, its
relative importance is declining, but it will probably continue to be tne largrest
source of investment funds in the near future. Long-run trends will be set by the
needs of the larger wand muore sop histicated manufacturing proposals now emerging,
increasingly frorn entrepreneurs whose own resources are more limited as compared to
those Who started business in previous years.
17 -      OI the few institutions wnicn proviae meaium- and long-term finance to
private industry and allied sectors, only the Bank of Ceylon and DFCC are
significant. in connection with the Bank loan to DFCC, the Government indicated
that the term finance of private industry in Ceylon was primarily the
responsibility of DFCC. In any event, the Bank of Ceylon does not have foreign



exchange resources. Apparently, it has established the practice of giving DFCC the
option of first refusal of proposals. However, DFCC has often been unable to
examine such proposals because of its limited staff and a long list of pending
applications. The Bank of Ceylon's approvals of term loans to industry are
estimated at Rs. 25 million and Rs. hO million in 1967 and 1968 respectively, i.e.
a considerably higher volume than DFCC's. One significant development has been the
establishment by the Bank of Cevlon of a subsidiarv firm. Industrial and Financial
Consultants (Ceylon) Limited (IFCC), whose functions are to develop and appraise
investment proposals. and to nrovide mTanagement and technical ronsultancv services
to industry and allied sectors. It has made a successful start with several
competent iobs f'or the Bank of Ceylon as well as for outs i de clients   Tt is staffed
by well-paid and qualified specialists (in management, production, finance, market-
ing, personnel), many with relevnnt expenrienc   in other cnitries.    Tt is thus a
valuable addition to Ceylon's investment and management expertise. The services of
FCCr are anvailable to DFCC, which howev.er has not yet r v.ailed itself of them..
18.       During the past year the Government has been pwvsuing al to set
up another financial institution, to be called the National Development Bank of
Ceylonr  (DMBr)  A".; w- s ' be a               --'-""  - subsidi  of 'be Central  - k.  Th

institution is needed to fill a gap in the structure of term financing facilities,
which will finaLL ce proJects too large for DFCC tvo hanlLe alone or projects whilch do
not meet normal bancing criteria but are thought to ha-ve high priority.    The
Guoverrmentu thue believes that the proposed institution would cgmplement rather than
compete with existing financial institutions.
19.        However, the need for the proposed IDBC is not clear.    Its establishment
will add one more to the existing financing institutions in a small country, and
may lead to the dissipation of scarce resources. Although the Government has
indicated that NFDBC will be run on a business-like basis, there is a possibility
that it might be used to finance Government approved projects without much regard
to economic criteria. in any case, it seems unnecessary to set up an institutlon
like NDBC on the ground that all of the capital required for the largest projects
in prospect should be available from one source. The Government has teen made
aware of these views.
20.       The NIDBC proposal will probably be presented for legislation in early
1970. Its acutal operations and staffing are under consideration and NDBC is
unlikely to commence business for at least another year. If it is established its
operations will need to be watched closely, not only for their potential impact on
DFCC but more importantly, for the quality of its use of scare capital.



II. THE CORPORATION AND ITS PERFORMANCE
21._L,    DF1CC!tts poulicy sta-teent aria partiLcuilars of its sIare1odUer'S
organization and management and resources are given in Annex 1.
Objectives and Powers
22.       DE2C was established by legislation, the DFCCO Act of 1955 (hereafter
referred to as the Act), which empowDers it to undertake the usual functions of a
development finance company, viz. lending, investing in shares, underwritLng,
guaranteeing financial obligations and providing technical assistance.  Thae Act
was amended In March 1967 to increase DFCC's authorized capital and broaden its
powers. In April 1967 DFCO adopted a statement of policy. Its field of
operations is defined as limited liability companies, privately owned (in which
the Government shareholding, if any, must not exceed 20%), in industry, agricul-
ture and comrerc'e, including hotels, transportation, ccnstruction and engIneering.
Ohnership
23.       As of March 31, 1969 DFCC's subscribed and paid-in share capita:L of
Rs. 8 million was held 39.5% by private Ceylonese investors, 35.5% by foreign
investors anl 25% by Govermment-owned institutions.  The latter formerly owned
40% of the share capital, but early in 1967 the Bank of' Ceylon (a Government-
owned commercial bank) sold a part of its holdings to private investors in
Ceylon. Since then there have been no significant changes in the share owner-
ship, which is relatively broad-based.
Management and Organization
24.       Board of Directors.  The general suDervision and control of DFCC is
vested in a nine-member Board of Directors (present strength eight) of whom
six, including the Chairman, are elected by the shareholders. One is a
Government nominee and the two others (including the General Manager of DECOC)
are ex-officio non-voting members. Mr. George Gomes, a Director, was appointed
Chairman in 1968 following the death of the previous Chairman, Mr. Richardi Pieris,
Mr. Gomes is a well respected businessman, and chief executive of the lar:2est
newspaper pu'blishing group in Ceylon. He has been active in DFCC's affairs,
having been .3 Board member for ten vers- and is alive 1-n its problems and nrosnects,
25.       renpral Mannagr   flDiClst chiesf recntiyve offricar is the ren-eral Mnnnager
From 1963 to June 1969 this position was held by Mr. L. A. Weerasinghe, formerly
a senior civil servant and Auiditor General of Ceylon.  From. Ju ly 1 he wilL' be
succeeded by Mr. C. Loganathan, formerly General Manager of the Bank of Ceylon,
an emnerienced anA agriaTosivo banker  4-h ar. tt,+n.at+or.al epu+vtr
Mr. Loganathan has been an active member of DFCC's Board since 1957 and is thus
thoroughly conversant w..ith the Corporation's affairs.* The Bank ezssed its
satisfaction with the appointment when it was consulted by DFCO on this m)tter.



- 7 -
26.       Advisor. At the time of the first Bank loan, the Bank emphasized the
need for DFCC to strengthen its management, and DFCC agreed to obtain the
services of an Advisor. It engaged Mr. G.J.M. Dyer in that capacity in
December 1967 for a twio-year term.
27.       Other Staff.  DFCC has two Assistant General Managers and five other
professional staff members. The professional staff of seven is greater by five
than it was when the first Bank loan was made. The staff as a whole is competent,
but the relative inexperience of the recently recruited throws a considerable
burden on the few, more senior members.
28.       Project Appraisal. All investments require Board approval.    DFCC
considers only projects approved or registered by the Government. Project
appraisal work is supervised by one of the Assistant General Managers, who has
a staff of two professionals and four others, supplemented from time to time by
temporary transfers of staff from other departments.
29.       The approval by the Government of a large batch of projects in 1967,
after a considerable period of inactivity, created heavy pressure on DFCC's small
staff just when it was getting ready to handle projects involving foreign
exchange finmnce for the first time. The appraisal work proceeded steadily but
slowly; only a handful of projects had been processed by mid-1968, by which time
the, list of pending spplieations had grown considerably.  Thus, although DFCC
has been processing more applications than before, its performance has been less
than adequate in relation to what needed to be done.   The delays were partly due
to the lack of basic information on many of the proposals and the uncertainties
inrlmd by t.hep exchange rate changes.  However, the delays were also aggravated
by the lack of effective executive gaidance and by staff limitations. The
organization of this work has been delegated almost entirely to one of the
Assistant General Managers, who also had to carry out most of the detailed tasks.
30.       The slowness in processing applications was also partly duLe to DFCC's
unwillingness to sacrifice qualit.y to speed. The standard of nroiect evaluation
has been improving since the Bank loan was made.   The appraisal reports received
by the Barnk have been of fair quuality, and the DFCC staff has shown a readiness
to take advice.
31.       DR,C has been conservative in its investment decisions.   It makes a
careful evaluation of the financisl viaility of projects, and prouides a form
of "economic justification" for the proposals, which is usually an analysis of
the foreign exchange savings, cost of production and price comparison with
similar local products; it does not usually deal with the international competi-
tiveness of production costs.  However, because of the factors cited in paragraph
10, which provide some safeguards that only the relatively more efficient domest'
urarldhes of Lndustry are developed and that importers of c8ap4tal equn.im.en;- are
paying its real cost, most of the financially viable projects appraised by DFCC
are likely to be also econormicaUly justifed.  Nevertheless, DFCC hs been
requested to strengthen its economic assessment of investment proposals before
it.



32.       End-use Supervision.  DFCUC's end-use supervision has been very limited
in scope, confined almost entirely to annual reviews of its clients' financial
statements. DFCC is more closely in touch with the 14 of its client companies
on whose boardcs it is represented, than with the others.  Inadequate  end-use
supervision has not so far had any ill effects on DFCC's operations, because its
choice of projects has been very conservative, and shortages in the econom   have,
in general, tended to make manufacturing enterprises very profitable. DFCC is
preparing to introduce a more comprehensive follow-up system. One of its staff
members recently received training with the Industrial Credit and Investmernt
Corporation of' Indio in this field.  The Bank has taken up with DFCC, and will
continue to press, the question of improving its end-use supervision.
Resources
33.       A summary of DFCC's resources as of March 31, 1969-/is given below:
Local Currency     Foreign Curre-ncy
Rs.'O0O             $ million
Share capital                         8,000
Reserves and surplus                  2,475
Government loan. subordinated        16.000

Total ~  ~    )n l.798             )l-n sf.2
million
Total resources were thus of the order of $10.85 million equivalent.   DFCC has made-
little 1se of thle 7nik of Ceylon credit facilijty since the second half of I965, but
hias refinanced all its rupee lending with the Central 9ankc, under a scheme wThich
provides to institutions 100% refinancing for approved loans, for terms up to 15
years at 4% interest subject to relending at not more than 7% interest.   The
only new type of resource since 1967 has been the Bank loan.
operations
34.       Particulars of DFCC's operations are CiVen in Annex 2.   As of March 31,
1969 total financial assistance approved nmounted to Rs. 82.8 million (about $14
million equivalent), consisting of 142 loans for Rs. 72.79 million, 30 share
investments for Rs. 9.09 million and two underwriting operations for Rs. 0.95
million. The underwritings were done in DFCC's early years.
1/ DECO's fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31. Thus fiscal 1969 ref'ers
to the period April 1, 1968 - March 31, 1969.

Lending
35.       DFUC's loan operations in the past five years were as follows:
Rs. '000
Fiscal Year              l0o)    iyoo    9yo7    1±Du     Lyuy
Loans approved (and committed)   3,935   3,o65   2,350   9,2h4   ?I,lu0-
Prior to fiscal year 1968 the highest annual volume of loans approved was less
than Rs. 7 million.  The level of lending has increased remarkably in the past
two years, due largely to the availability of foreign exchange resources and to
the upsurge in industry. Rupee lending also increased, and the average size of
loans has gone up.
36.       The average duation of loans has increased considerably in the past two
years, with amiortization periods of around 15 years predominating for foreign
currency loans. This long term appears to have been prompted mainly by DFCC' s
wish to ease Ceylon's foreign exchange repayment burden. The matter was discussed
during the loan negotiations, when DFCC confirmed that in future, in using the
Bank's funds, it will set the terms of its loans in accordance with sound banking
principles, in the light of the nature of the project, the condition of the
borrower, and its own interests.
37.       DFCC;'s current interest rates are 9-1/25 and 79 on foreign currency
and rupee loans, respectively.   The other financial institutions charge between
7% and 105 on most of their term loans.
38.       nFCCGfs Rnard hns set, as a guideline, limits on sector investments in
textiles (20%- of total portfolio) and hotels (151), after receiving applications
from relatively large pn ieets from those two sectors,   These limits reflect
an attitude of caution. DFCC's loans and investments have been reasonably well
diversified over a wi-.de range of consumer goods induistriAs. but geographically
are concentrated in and around Colombo,, which is characteristic of industry
in Ceylon.

1L2.   Capital Structure.   The current position changed from negative to pnoitive
in 1968, owing to an increase in bank deposits following greater use of Central
Bank refinancing.  The true debt/,qoiitv ratio h;s been around 2.1 in recent yars!
representing a relatively low leverage. Because of the relatively high propor-
tion of DFf.' s resourre!  rprented by thr Gnoere-rent?s subordinated loan, DnC1i G
debt/equity ratio as defined in the Bank loan agreement (including the GoveiTzaent
loan in enMi t1T And pyxn'1 - ing it from debt) has heen low, orly  1  as of the er.d
of fiscal 1969.

Government loan in the long-term resources (excluding equity) enployed in fiscal
1969, the c-s' of the resoUurces was L.3% as against the O.U8o earned on its pot--
folio, giving a "spread" of 5.5%.
44.    Earnings Results.   Although this "spread" has been high, DFCC's profit-
au LUy   as bDeen modest because of its low leverage and increasing auministrative
costs. Profitability increased gradually through 1967 (an exceptional year, when
certain dividends previously in arrears were received), declined in 1968, but
increased again in 1969.   The decline in 1968 was partly due to a proporticnately
higher tax provision.   in 1968 and 1969 salary expenses increased appreciably
from those of 1967, mainly because of new recruitment to deal with the additional
workload following receipt of the Bank loan on which, however, very little interest
has so far been received.   Administrative expenses, as a percentage of outstanding
portfolio, increased from 0.9 in 1965 to 1.5 in 1969. Moreover, the ratio of the
no-cost Goverinment loan to total resources used has been declining.
45.    Distribution of Earmings.   The Act requires DFCC to set aside at least
20% of its annual net profits (as defined) in a special reserve until this
reserve equalS the outstanding Government loan. The dividend-payout in the
past three years has been an average of 65% of net profits. DFCC has paid a
dividend everyr year since 1960, the rates in the past three years being 8%.
46.    As of the end of 1969, the special and general reserves together amounted
to about Rs. 2.3 million, equivalent to 6.3% of outstanding loan and share
investment portfolio.   In addition, DFCC has made provisions for bad debts and
investments, wThose cumulative total (net of write offs) is now Rs. 800,000.
Reserves and provisions taken together amounted to 9.0% of the 1969 year-end
portfolio; this proportion increased every year between 1965-1968, but declined
slightly in 1969.
Portfolio
47.    Because DFCC has been conservative in its investment decisions, and since
profitability in manufacturing has been high, DFCC's loan and investment port-
folio is financially sound.   The portfolio is diversified and well seasoned.
The share investment portfolio is not overvalued at the balance sheet figure.
The delinquency record (Annex 3E) has been verv satisfactorv. with the write-offs
so far amounting to less than 1% of cumulative approvals, and the current
arrearages insianificant.   Thus; the reserves and pr-rvisinrs are adequmte.

Relations with the Government

brought -n+   '  -g r contact -w,ith t    hee TDer-lopM..+  TDivis-or of the  A.-T)i +Uy of

consultation between the Ministry of Industry and DFCC. The committee has proved
tvo  e use'^LU' ,Ar maO Ling `UL- bwO parLLes appreciatvve of  i each oUtheris probULeiis anu
thus in evolving a better mutual understanding.
III.  Dr-C's PROSPECTS
50.    The growth of the private sector in Ceylon appears to be gathering
morer,um, and with it the  low of fiinancing opportunities for ]FCC. DFCC has
the prospect of becoming an institution of increasing imp)ortance to Ceylon's
economic development. wnether that opportunity is seized will depend as much
on DFCC's future leadership and management, as on the general environment for
productive private investment.
Management and Staff
,1.    Mr. Gomas, who became DFCC's Chairman in late 1968$, and Mr. Loganathan,
General Manager from July 1, 1969, are likely to provide DFCC with competenl;
and aggressive leadership and management.
52.    Mr. Loganathan intends to expand DFCC's staff capacity to the extent
necessary to enable DFCC to take full advantage of the opportunities available
to it.  His plans have not yet taken final shape, but they will involve additional
recruitment of experienced men to strengthen DFCC's present staff, the use of
consultants such as IFCC and the procurement of technical assistance from sources
abroad. It is likely that over the next two years DFCC's capacity to seek and
handle busines-s will be greatly strengthened.
Prospects for Operations
53.    As already indicated, the prospects for the growth of Ceylon's economy
and of the private sector are good. In view of the expected variations in the
growth rate of private industrial investment in Ceylon, mentioned in paragraph 14,
and taking intco account pending applications (see below), it is likely that
DFCC's operations will increase substantially in the next two years or so; there-
after the rate of increase may slow down. At least for the next two or three
years, DFCC need expect no difficulty in raising the additional resources it will
need. One source of rupee funds on which DFCC counts is an issue of share capital



soon, referred to in paragraph 67 below. DFOC also counts on continuing Central
Bank refin-anig4-, and on. other dor.es%c I A-r^ ."^  TT +the la+ern rs of th

The forecast of operations for 1972-:L974 is therefore deliberately conservative.
Policy Limits

enterprise an.Ud to t'he aggrega-te 01 Is sihiar- invo uLnAti U See paragraph 10 UL
DFCC's StatemLent of Policy, Annex 1, Page 2.)
55.    DFCC'S normal limit on maximum exposure in an individual enterprise is
presently the equivalent of l5% of tne sum or its equity and tne subordinated
Government loan. The manner in which that limit has been publicized in Ceylon
has contributed to an impression, harmful to DFICC, in business and Government
circles that DFCC's operations are invariably restricted to the small-scale.
DFCC proposed that the normal Limit be rai6od to 205' of the sum of DFCC's equity
and subordinated Government loan. The Bank agreed, considering 20% not ixrprudent
in view of the experience of DCCI's management and because of the opportunities
opening up for DFCC.
56.    DFCC has two policy limits on share investments:   one applies to the
aggregate of such outstanding investments, the limit being an amount equivalent
to DFCC's equity; the other applies to share investments in an individual enter-
prise, to which the limit is 10% of DFCC's equity. Those two limits represented
about Rs. 10..48 million and Rs. 1.05 million respectively, as of March 31, 1969.
57.    DFCC intends in future to pursue investments in share capital more
actively. Accordingly,during the negotiations, DPCC said it wishes to relax
these two restrictions on such investments, by applying the percentages to the
sum of DFCC'E; equity and the outstanding amount of the subordinated GoverTment
loan, rather than to DFCC's equity alone. For reasons similar to those mentioned
above, and having in mind the fact that the Government loan is subordinate to
share capital and will call for only small annual payments, the Bank indicated
its willingness to approve such increases.
Fbrecasts
58.    Estimate of Cperations, 1970 and 1971.   Of relevance to the estimate is
the volume of applications in the pipeline. DFCC is presently processing applica--
tions totalling about Rs. 20 million, of which Rs. 5 million is in local currency.
As against the uncredited balance of the first Bank loan of about $1.68 million
(as of June 30, 1969) there were two pending applications for $1.33 million.
The loan is exDected to be fully committed by Au.;jst 1969.
59.    After examininL the information available with the Ministrv of TnduLstrv
on the recently approved projects, DFCC has made a preliminary selection of what
annpear tn be ths more prcnisina among them.  These. together with a few. ni;her

DFCC would do well to achieve a steady increase in the annual level of such
in-vestments. MAoreover, DrCC 9 endeavors are expected t0o be directed towards
making a higher proportion of real equity investments (Eas distinct from redeemable,
fixed-interest preference shares) than it had done in the past.

Future Resour-es
63.      Foreign Currency Resources, 1970 and 1971. The resources in hand or in
sight are the uncredited balance of $1.6bmillion of the Bank loan (as of Jume 30,
1969) and a proposed loan from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) of DId 6
million ($1.5 million equivalent).  'hat leaves a balance of about $8 million
required to maet forecast commitments of just over $11 million.
64.      The proposed loan from KfW has been under consideration since the end
of calendar year 1968, and is likely to be signed in July or August, 1969. Of
the proposed amount, DM 2 million is intended to be earnmarked for tourism
projects. The loan would carry interest at 5-1/2!. of which only 3% would be
payable to KtW and the other 2-1/2% retained in Ceylon as a training fund. It
would have a fixed amortization extending over 25 years with seven years' grace.
The loan is t) be guaranteed by the Central Bank.

65.      Anotier loan, from the Canadian Government, is in a very prelimincry
stage of consWderation. The proposals under examination envisage a low interest,
long-term loan, tied to Canadian procurement, for an amount of Can$4 millicin, to
be committed at the rate of Can$l million a year for four years.    The initial
amount at DFOCCs disposal would probably be Can$1 million, in 1971.
66.      Rupee Resources, 1970 and 1971.   For most of its rupee needs (estimated
to total about Rs. 38 million ovAr the two vyar.s) DFCM is eountinL7 on usinr
Central Bank refinancing; loan collections, estimated at Rs. 10 million, are
exAnc.ted8 to nrovide +he balance. DnECOs outstanding borrowings fromm thp CGntral

other sources of rupee funds, especially from the capita:L market, and will be

Projections and Financial Results
69.      Projections of DFCC's financial statements through 1974 are given in
Annex 4. For those through 1971, it is assumed that the gap in foreign exchange
resources lwill, be filled by a Bank loan of up to $8 million, which is recommended
in a later section.

71.      The forecast shows sharp increases in total assets and portfolio.   The
leverage on resources will increase, but the "spread" wrill decline because of the
rapid increase irn the p.ronortionn of' t.he higcher intrerst;-herinF BRnk funds in
total resources used. Frofitability in relation to assets will naturally decline,
hit. profitt as a prnportion- of Pniiity1 will increase to a monr  satisfctonrv level
than the present.
72.      Through 1971, reserves and provisions as a proportion of outstanding
port-folio are expected to decline.  Although they shord increase somewhnt
after 1973 and DFCO will have a larger equity base, the decline is undesirable,
especially s:Ler±  irrP. is expec+d to beh mnre ventarrsome in f)ituire and m. ore

TV. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOM      AENTAIlONS
Conclusions
7h.      DFCC remaLned from its inception until 1967 an unambitious comPany.
with modest growth and profitability.    The contribution it made to Ceylon's
economy wss uefifl. hbut too sm01I to have any real imnact. DFCCO s resources
were small, the economic environment was not favorable and its management was
relativel-' inactire.  T.he character and prospects of DnCrO began to change in 1968.
Buoyant conditions in industry and the availability of foreign exchange resources
have radically crhanged the scale ea r  character eof l DI's lendin.g operations.
Recent levels of lending substantially exceed the highest achieved in the past.
The financing has beer b ased                 -onr4a. fro-. ;ng aprial s+ndards. Some
staff has been recruited and training is proceeding.    On the basis of applications

prev-ious levelLs of bUsi4ness    II, hit   'o9eer. less so AM relatGion to thle le..d-ing oppor-

and its staff has been inadequate.    However, the quality of the management is
e+ected w  p urve  LnfcnlX          eCasfa      n       new Guerier-al M-anager of
DFCC are likely to provide dynamism to the institution, enabling it to progress
rapidly in corventional as well as new fields of business.
76.      Tne prospects for industry and allied sectors in Ceylon are bright.,
and the Government's actions have encouraged a large and growing number of
investment proposals in those sectors. In consequence, there will be an
increasing denand for finance from external, institutional sources, especially
from DEUC.   Ithe Bank of Ceylon (the only other significant long-term financing
institution) and DFCC have a satisfactory arrangement, providing for the former
to refer projects to DPcC first.   A new factor will be the proposed Nationai
Development Bank, whose stated purpose is to complement existing financial institu-
tions; what course it will actually take will need to be closely watched.     In
the near future, at least, there is great scope for DFCC and, in recognition not
only of its prudent past performance but also of the prospect that DFCO is on the
threshold of significant developments, the Bank has agreed to the suggested.
increases in the limits on the size of DFCC's individual operations and of its
aggregate share investments.
77.      On the basis of applications being processed and in sight, DFCC is
likely to be able to commit about $11 million equivalent in foreign exchange
over the next two years, DECO had about $1.7 million uncommitted against the
first Bank loan (as of June 30, 1969), and is likely to get a $1.5 million loan
from Kfl. DPCC would thus need another $8 million to meet anticipated foreign
exchange loan commitments in the next two years. Its rupee resources are likely
to be adequate.



Recommndations
78.      DFCC is a suitable borrower for a second Bank loan of up to $8 mi}.lion.
79.      It is recommended that the "free limit" for DFCC be increased to

B.  Shareholders
1.   A list of DFCC's Shareholders, as of December 31, 1968, is given in
Table 1 to this annex, and may be summarized as follows:
Amount of 'hores Held     Percent of Total
(Rs. 100 each)
GSovernment                          20.012                 25.0

2.   DFOC's authorized share capital is Rs. 24 million, increased from
RS. 8 mil1on byr the amentdingAct of 1967.   The subscribed and paid-
in capital is presently Rs. 8 million, which is held as above. The
Bank of CeTylon is the 1-axrest  i      hnlholdr T.T it.h nahut. 2nfl of

thereby  making the Governmeint a significant shareholder.    Sub-
sequentiy, tt'here were further increases in the Governmunient share-
holding, following the nationalization of life insurance business
in January 1964 and sales by foreign insurance companies to the
state-owned Insurance Corporation of Ceylon.    As a result, the
propDrtion of total share capital held by Governm-ent-owned corpora-
tions increased to over 45%.    The proportion was reduced to 40%
following the September 1966 issue.    Early in i.967 tne Bank of
Ceylon sold over Rs. 1.2 million worth of shares to private
investors in Ceylon, thereby reducing to 25%t the Government-held
proportion of total capital.
4.   Since the above transactions, there have not been any major or
significant changes in the shareholding.    Tne ownership of MFCC
is fairly broadbased, by Ceylon standards.

C. Organization and Management
1.   The Corporation's organization chart is given as Table 2 to this annex.
2.   Board of Directors.  As of June 1969, the Board ccnsisted of the eight
followinmg Directors:
Affiliation
G,B.S. G)mes                      Chairman of the Board, since 1968 (a
Director since 19,59). Managing Director,
The Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd.
IW.L. Gash                       MIanager, Colombo Branch, National anid
Grindlays Bank Ltd.
C. Loganathan                     General Manager, Bank of Ceylon
C. Nadesam                        Head Shroff, Colombo Branch,
Indian Overseas Bank Ltd.
N.E. Weerasooria, Q.C.            Barrister
P.V.M. Fernando                   Assistant to the Governor, Central
Bank of Ceylon (Government nominee,
statutory)
Dr. G. Ponnamperuma               Director, Ceylon Institute of Scientific
and Industrial Research (ex-officio)
L.A. Weerasinghe, F.C.A.          General Tanager. DFCC (ex-officio)
3.   The DFGC Act permits a maximum of eight "shareholder-directors",
against which DFCC had had six.  One of those is vacant now, due to
the annointment of Mr. Gomes, a former Director, as Chairman; the
Board intends to fill it soon. As of July 1, 1969, Mr. Loganathian will
assume office as General Manager of DFCC and ex-officio member of the
Board. There will thus be a second vacancy on the Board. The Ceylon
Instituhpte of Scientific and Industrial Research (CISIR) was established
simultaneously with DFCC, and was intended to provide it with technical
assistanceo

h.   Management and Staff.  The -;dvisor's (Mr. Dyer's) contract will expire
in DecembDer 1969, but can be extended by mutual agreement. His salary
and expenses are financed mainly by the British Government under the
Colombo Plan, and partly by DFCC.
5.   The Assistant General Manager (.4dainistration), Mr. Kanagaratnam, is an
accountant by training.  He is in charge of accounts, administration,
legal work and end-use supervision.  Mr. de Fonseka, the other assistant
General Manager, is in charge of all phases of project appraisal work,
He was previously an official of the Bank of Ceylon for some years, and
attended an EDI course in Washirngton in 1966.
6.   At the tLme the Bank loan was made, DFCC had only the above two professional
staff members, apart from the General NTkna-er. There are now seven
professionals, a result of the upgrading of oxisting staff (the Senior, Loans
Officer and the Accountant) and new recruitment.  Ihere are seven other
junior staff members (four of them working on project appraisal), some of
whom are expected to reach professional standards after training.
7.   Procedunrs. All of DECC's loans and investment proposals require the
approval of its Board, which meets once a month. The Board does not
involve Ltself in the initial stages of project appraisal or in
organizing appraisal work.
8. DFCC considers applications for only those projects which have been
approved or registered by the Government. In their' work of project
evaluation, the staff try to make the most use of information available
with the Government, especially the Ministry of Industry and Fisheries.
Other than the report of consultants engaged by sponsors, in recent years
DFCC has used little outside assistance (including that from CISIR) in
proiect appraisal.
9.   Proiect :unnprvision is the responsibility of Mr. Kanagaratnam. It
consists chiefly of a study of audited annual accounts submitted by
clients. It is the practice to submit an annual progress report to
the Board for each project. Efforts are made to visit projects once
every year, but in practice visits have been less freauent. As of
June 1969, DFCC was represented on the boards of 14 client companies,
with whose affairs it vyqs thus in closer touch.

D. Resources
1.   A summary, of DFCC's resources is given in paragraph 33 of the main
text.
2.   Government loan. An interest-free Government loan of Rs. 16 million was
made to DFC in 1956 under the provisions of the Act. It is subordinate
to the share capital and to other debt in the event of liquidation.   In
accordance with the Act., as amended, the loan is repayable in 15 equal
annual installments beginning in 1982, after a grace period of 25 years.
3.   Bank of Ceylon facility.  By an agreement in August 1964, DFUC obtained
an overdraft facility with the Bank of Ceylon up to a maximum limit of
Rs. 4.5 rillion.  Overdrafts were convertible at DFCC's option into 1C-
year loans, at 41hI interest through June 1965 and at 5% interest there-
after.  DFCC had made use of this facility until the latter half of 1566,
since when it has been using instead the refinance facilities available
from the Central Bank of Ceylon. In April 1967 a revised agreement was
entered into, to provide for an overdraft limit of Rs. 1 millicn, with
the right of conversion of any part of the overdraft into 10-year loans,
such loans and the outstanding overdraft together not to exceed Rs. 4.5
million, and to be secured by mortgage of DFCC's share investments;
the interest wzas 5%. The agreement was amended further in Say 1969, to
provide for an overdraft limit of Rs. 2 million, and a higher interest
rate of 6,. During fiscal year 1969 DFCC had occasion to use a small
amount of this facility.
4.   Central Bank refinance.   The refinance scheme of the Central Bank of
Ceylon, as revised in April 1966 and recently, makes available finance
up to 15 years, at 4% interest to DFCC, subject to a lending rate of
not mo^ than 7%~ Fainds are provided up to 100% of the face value of
the Corporation's loans, provided they are offered as security.
5.   The Bank Loan of $4 million was approved in November 1967 and became
effeoc'tilr in FebrLmar9. 6 I8 .4 Tts. renauvmAnt is 1inker to the amortization
schedules of sub-loans made by DFCC, not to extend beyond February 1985
in any case.  The rte of inrest paable on the ioan is variabe1e      being
the Bank's prevailing rates at the time credits are made for individual
sub-loans .  Th.e Covem.Ment bears the exchange risk on tha Loan, in terms
of the DFCC Act.
