MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF MALAWI FOR AN
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and reconmendation on a proposed
development credit to Malawi for SDR8.8 million (US$11.3 million equivalent)
is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity and would help finance an institutional development
project. Cofinancing of US$6.0 million equivalent would be provided by UNDP.
2.          Background.  Malawi has been experiencing significant economic
difficulties as a result of adverse internal and external developments, in
particular the closure of traditional transport routes through Mozambique, the
influx of large numbers of refugees, and a further decline in the terms of
trade. The Government has been in a program of structural adjustment since
the early 1980s designed to stabil4ze the economy and establish the foundation
for renewed economic growth. The Bank has supported Malawi's adjustment
efforts through three SALs, two TA projects, and, most recently, an Industrial
and Trade Policy Adjustment Credit. The SALs and TA projects supported
improvements in public sector management; however, some of these reforms,
e.g., in areas of forward budgeting and debt management, have not been
sustained, as was noted in the PPAR on SALs I and II and TA I (No. 6833, June
12, 1987). The PPAR also noted that the institutional capacity to sustain
reform in Malawi was fragile and required a longer time frame than that
provided by the three operations. In retrospect, SALs, with their emphasis on
immediate actions and tranche releases, and TA projects, which generally had a
short-term perspective, were not the appropriate vehicles in which to
introduce and nurture institutional change.
3.          The Government has adopted a medium term development strategy for
the period 1987-1996, which supports the need for strengthening national
economic management.  The Government seeks to accomplish its goal by providing
an internal capability to train Malawian managers in the skills and techniques
needed to run a sophisticated, modern economy. It also realizes that
management and systems in the central government should operate more
efficiently, and that it requires a long-term program of institutional
strengthening to accomplish these objectives. The Government has requested
IDA assistance for such a program.
4.          Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Through adjustment operations and
TA projects, IDA has been supporting Malawi's efforts to strengthen its
capacity for economic management. However, the experience of the previous
operations has demonstrated that a long-term, measured approach is necessary
for institutional change to take root and grow. Having learned from its
previous experiences, IDA is well-placed to coordinate a long-term program of
institutional development, one which focuses on a limited number of high
priority areas and provides technical assistance designed to enhance existing
capacity rather than replace it.
5.          Project Obiective.  The project's objective is to strengthen
national economic management. The proposed management institute would offer a



- 2 -
wide range of truining programs and seminars aimed at improving the capacity
of Malawian managers in the public and private sectors. The strengthening
program in the Ministry of Finance would improve the Ministry's capability to
manage public resources through upgrading processes for budgeting, accounting
and auditing, debt management and claims, and would improve revenue flows
through modernization of the tax system.
6.          Protect Description.  The project would establish and operate the
Malawi Institute of Management (MIM) to train managers in the public and
private sectors in management techniques. In addition to its own campus, KIM
would work closely with the University of Malawi, sharing facilities with two
of the University's affiliates, Chancellor College and the Polytechnic. An
endowment fund would be established to receive all the fees MIM generates
during the five year project investment period. Income from its endowment,
along with annual fees, would help MIM cover its operating expenses in the
post-project period. The project would fund MIM's civil works, furniture,
equipment and operating costs. A Canadian consortium has been selected to
provide initial technical services under a twinning arrangement. If its
performance is satisfactory after a one year period, the consortium will be
offered a multi-year contract.
7.          The project would also assist the Ministry of Finance (XOF) with
the implementation of its Development Plan and its ongoing tax modernization
program. MOF would be reorganized to strengthen its forward budgeting
capability, to improve government accounting and auditing, and to strengthen
claims processing and debt management. The project would also continue
support for the ongoing tax modernization begun under SAL III. The tax
program is supporting reforms in trade taxes, more efficient collection of
corporate taxes and an improved duty-drawback scheme to promote export growth.
The project would provide the technical assistance, equipment and training
required to help MOP carry out its Development Plan and tax modernization
program. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
UNDP would provide US$6.0 million equivalent in parallel financing. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group Operations in Malawi are given in Schedules C-E. A map
is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7642-MAI dated May 5, 1989,
is being distributed separately.
8.          Actions Agreed.  During negotiations it was agreed that MIM woulds
(i) be established through an Act of Parliament (condition of effectiveness);
(ii) review the initial twinning relationship with the external consortium and
advise IDA, prior to the end of the current one-year contract with the
consortium, on its decision to either enter into a new contract for a three-
year period with the same consortium, or to make alternative arrangements
satisfactory to IDA; (iii) consult with IDA on the qualifications and
experience of future candidates for Principal; (iv) develop a comprehensive
plan for its consulting program, including a schedule of fees to be charged
and arrangements for fee sharing with staff, to be reviewed with IDA by
December 31, 1989; (v) establish an endowment fund by December 31, 1989, and
prepare a strategy for the use of endowment resources for discussion with IDA



- 3 -
by December 31, 1992; and (vi) undertake a review of MIM's technical
assistance reqairements after 1992, and prepare a report on its findings and
recommenuations for discussion with IDA by December 31, 1992. It was also
agreed that MOF would, by December 31, 1989, take the following measures to
carry out its comprehensive Development Plan: (i) restructure its organization
in accordance with the Plan, with the assistance of consultants as necessary;
(ii) prepare a plan for introducing a forward budget system, develop terms of
reference for a user needs study of computerization requirements and prepare a
plan for improving its audit services; and (iii) prepare a human resources
development plan, including a timetable for filling vacancies for professional
positions in MOF.
9.          Benefits.  The project would continue the process begun u'.ier
previous adjustment operations of strengthening Malawi's capacity for national
economic management. Establishing MIM would provide the country with an in-
service management training capability for middl- level and senior officials
in the civil service, parastatals and private sector. This would remove the
economy's dependence on external training sources and would enable a much
larger group of managers, from 200 per annum at present to almost 1,000 per
annum at the end of the project, to receive management training. The proposed
program for strengthening MOF would enable it to provide better economic
management. Under MOF's Development Plan, forward budgeting, accounting and
auditing, and financial management would be reorganized to operate more
efficiently. The tax modernization program would improve the tax structure
and modes of collection, resulting in greater incentives for local production
and increased public revenues.
10.         Risks.  The project risks are: (i) that MIM would be slow to
develop into a credible training institute and that it would be financially
dependent on the Government; and (ii) that the strengthening program in MOF
would not be sustained over the time required for reforms to be fully
internalized. The programs for both components have been designed to minimize
these risks. MIM's twinning arrangement with an external consortium and its
close association with the University of Malawi would enable it to operate
initially at a high level while local staff gradually assume control. The
probability of MIM's financial independence would be increased through its
proposed endowment, though ultimately the best assurance would be its
recognition as a center of excellence in management training which would
ensure demand for its courses and enable it to market its consulting services.
For MOF, the programs have been designed against modest targets and would be
introduced slowly with the full participation of Malawian staff.
11.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

The study was not undertaken until 1986, and it is from this date that
project preparation is considered to have officially begun, although the
concept was discussed with the Government much earlier.
