1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design  

The Parana Biodiversity Project (PBP) was a five year project aimed at the consolidation of existing
biodiversity corridors in globally important forest eco-regions that occur in the state of Parana, Brazil
(Brazilian Atlantic Forest and Araucaria Forest). The two eco-regions are internationally recognized as
unique and important repositories of biodiversity, but severely threatened by deforestation and forest
fragmentation. The PBP also intended to establish biodiversity management models that would assist
stakeholders in organizing conservation activities throughout the State.

The PBP was supported by a US$8.0 million grant from the Global Environmental Facility Trust Fund
(GEF). The Grant Agreement between the State of Parana and IBRD was approved by the Board of
Executive Directors on May 21, 2002. The project became effective on August 27, 2002. The project
was extended once for a period of 24 months and closed on January 31, 2009.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

a. Country and Sector Background: Parana harbors significant, pristine tracts of important ecoregions,
including Araucaria Forest and Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, or "Mata Atlantica." The global
importance of these ecoregions' is based upon their extraordinary biodiversity and the fact that they are
threatened by agricultural expansion, deforestation, forest fragmentation, and habitat degradation for
many species. Both the Federal and State governments faced the ever growing challenge of balancing
development priorities and conservation. Another limitation affecting conservation was the lack of
efficiency and coordination between agencies that characterized most public bodies in charge with
biodiversity conservation. Due to the financial crisis that had affected Federal and State governments, the
tight budget constraints imposed by Federal debt renegotiations and legislation governing the size of
Government payrolls resulted in a freeze on hiring, and reduced resources for lower priority
environmental initiatives.

b. Federal Government Strategic Initiatives: Despite this scenario, considerable progress had been made
in reforming legislation and regulations bearing on environmental issues although implementation has
often lagged. Since 1998, the Federal Government had created over 1.2 million hectares of strict
conservation protected areas including four parks totaling about 50,000 ha in the Atlantic Forest. Major
institutional reforms included approval of the following legislations: the National Protected Areas System
Law (SNUC), a "Green Protocol" requiring banks and lending agencies to consider environmental criteria
in project finance, National Water Resources Law (1997), Environmental Crimes Law (1998), a
legislation allowing for forested lands to be considered to be "in productive use". Also an Agenda 21 for
Brazil and for the Amazon was prepared. Environmental management was decentralized to states and
municipalities. In addition, the Ministry of Environment was providing substantial support to individual
States for the implementation of environmental programs. This initiative was partially funded by the
Bank-financed Second National Environment Program (PNMA II), from which the State of Parana had
received funding.

c. c. State of Parana Strategic Initiatives: During the 1990s, the State of Parana became an
environmental leader in Brazil as evidenced by its groundbreaking work on fiscal incentives for
biodiversity conservation (ICMS-Ecologico) and tradable development rights (SISLEG). The State
launched the "Biodiversity Network Program" in 1997 that was intended to mainstream environmental
conservation throughout the State Government structure. The Government had used it own funds to
support project preparation and established a strong and well funded project preparation unit in the
Planning Secretariat. It was also committed to applying US$10 million of the Bank-funded "Parana Rural
Poverty Alleviation and Natural Resources Management Project" (Parana 12 Meses) as cofinancing for


1
the PBP to finance the implementation of alternative production systems in PBP targeted interstitial1
areas. Equally encouraging was its commitment to undertake significant environmental reforms,
including regulation of the cutting of natural stands of Araucaria, and certification of Araucaria and non-
timber forest products.


d. Country Assistance Strategy: The CAS (March 24, 2000) specifically cited the PBP and several
closely related pipeline operations which addressed and defined environmental program objectives.
These operations had in common (i) targeting of critical biodiversity rich areas, (ii) creation of unbroken
"corridors" which include interstitial areas to improve biodiversity maintenance and management, (iii)
institutional strengthening to ensure enforcement of appropriate laws, regulations, and adoption of
incentive based programs, (iv) stakeholder participation, and (v) strengthening of monitoring and
evaluation functions. The design of the PBP directly addressed each of these five points.

e. Rationale for Bank Assistance: The World Bank has a long-standing and productive partnership with
the State of Parana since the 1980s, mainly through the support to programs aimed at developing
environmentally sustainable agricultural production systems through improved land management. Based
on this, the Bank's involvement was a logical continuation of such partnership, and was instrumental to
the decision to launch an ambitious environmental project in rural areas. In addition to serving as a
catalyst to mobilize and reorient the Government's environmental programs, Bank participation in the
PBP would add value in the following ways:
    i.   The Bank would serve as an "independent broker" among competing government agencies and
         stakeholders which were especially important in a multi-sector operation.
   ii.   The Bank had successfully directed the inclusion of significant institutional and regulatory
         reforms cited above.
  iii.   The Bank had, in a parallel effort, supported a collaborative effort by Government, NGOs, and
         the private sector to identify important public and private land holdings and to develop proposals
         as to how they might be incorporated into protected areas.
  iv.    Bank experience with Brazilian, Latin American, and global environmental reform including
         corridor consolidation and management of Conservation Units (UC) could help to orient design
         work on these components.
   v.    Bank knowledge of Brazilian initiatives, including the RFPP program and GEF ARPA work
         would provide important input to project design.
  vi.    The interstitial area management component would draw upon the Bank's loan resources and
         experience. The loan's Task Manager was also responsible for the PBP project which would
         ensure close coordination.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

a. Global Environment Objectives: The primary objectives of the Paraná Biodiversity Project (PBP)
were (i) to support biodiversity conservation and sustainable natural resource management in two highly
threatened ecoregions in the State of Paraná, the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest and Araucaria Forest, and
to (ii) design and implement a model for improving biodiversity conservation in Paraná.

The project would achieve these objectives in three selected areas of the State through: (a) mainstreaming
biodiversity conservation among targeted Government agencies, rural communities and civil society
organizations; (b) mitigating threats to biodiversity through establishment of three ecological corridors
and consolidation of sustainable practices in target areas; (c) strengthening monitoring and enforcement

  Interstitial: at the landscape level, non-forested areas intermingled with native forest fragments. They are needed
to maintain or re-create connectivity among conservation units.

functions ; and (d) reviewing and developing relevant norms, legislation, regulation, enforcement and
incentive systems.

                              Figure 1. Map of Three Ecological Corridors




b. Target Areas: The PBP supported the consolidation of three ecological corridors: two in the inland
Atlantic Rainforest and one in the Araucária Forest.

        i.   Caiuá Ilha Grande Corridor. Located on the northwestern border of Paraná, the corridor
             generally follows the Rio Paraná which contributes to making this one of the Atlantic
             Rainforest's richest repositories of biodiversity. It included an archipelago of more than 300
             islands, várzeas (periodically flooded areas), alluvial forests and transitional areas between
             forest and savanna. The main State Parks targeted by the PBP for Management Plans and
             modernization are the Caiuá Ecological Station and the São Camilo State Biological Reserve.

        ii. Iguaçu-Paraná Corridor. Located in the southeastern corner of the State, this area was under
            pressure from agricultural expansion initiatives owing to the richness of its soils. It was
            important also because it linked the Federal Iguaçu National Park, the largest continuous area
            of inland Atlantic forest, with a major initiative to recuperate areas in and around the lake
            formed by the Itaipú hydroelectric dam. The PBP would target the State Park of Rio Guarani
            and the Cabeça do Cachorro Area of Relevant Ecological Interest for the development of
            management plans.

        iii. Araucária Corridor. Paraná has the largest Araucária (Araucária angustifolia) forests in
             Brazil, which at one time covered roughly 40 percent of the State's area. Less than 1 percent
             of the original forest survives in a highly fragmented pattern, exacerbating its fragility.
             Located in the Araucária ecoregion in the center-south of the State, the area chosen for the
             corridor represents among the most important surviving forests and those with the best
             chance of achieving sustainability through increased connectivity and corridor consolidation.

Together, the three Corridors cover an area of about two million hectares. In addition, they involve seven
state protected areas, 280 micro-catchments and 63 municipalities. The corridors comprise over 40
percent of the territory of the 63 municipalities. The rural population was estimated at about 300,000.

c. Key Indicators: The key performance indicators for the PBP were:

    i. Selection of species and environmental quality indicators.
    ii. Provide technical basis to promote any necessary institutional and legislative revisions.
    iii. Adoption of alternative production systems in 40% of targeted interstitial areas in
          microcatchments or roughly 336,000 ha of the total area of 840,000 ha.
    iv. Involvement of about 19,600 producers in the PBP interstitial area dissemination/training
          programs and adopting alternative production systems.
    v. An estimated 21,000 participants in the training program including; i) project management, ii)
          EMATER environmental advisors, iii) rural producers--basic concepts, agriculture modules, iv)
          UC-IAP staff, v) IAP-municipal inspectors, vi) local justices training.
    vi. Creation of a Central Macro-Planning Unit in IAP and development of strategic intervention
          plans for three Corridors.
    vii. Six prototype Management Plans including interstitial area programs under implementation
    viii. An estimated 20,000 ha of native species forest planted annually.
    ix. 15 municipalities with effective decentralized systems of fiscalization.
    x. Deforestation reduced in priority municipalities and interstitial areas.
    xi. Protection of threatened species; maintenance of abundance of targeted species within corridors.
    xii. Studies carried out to provide the technical basis and/or support for key policy aspects, including
          licensing, enforcement, fiscal incentives, and environmental legislation,:
    xiii. Development and use of a comprehensive biodiversity database

1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The original objective was not modified and the associated outcome targets remained unchanged
throughout the duration of the project, although, as part of the Mid Term Review, the Grant agreement
was amended on February 2, 2007, approving a Second-Order Restructuring and reallocation of funds,
and extending the closing date from January 31, 2007 to January 31, 2009. Additional details are provided
in Section 2.2 (Implementation).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries identified in the PAD were as follows:
    i. Farmers and other economic stakeholders in the Corridors' interstitial areas who would be offered
         training, technical assistance and funding to convert to environmentally benign agricultural
         activities and technologies;
    ii. Municipal governments, local NGOs, opinion makers, and teachers who would be given the
         opportunity to receive training, participate in PBP design and supervision, and, in the case of
         municipalities, assume responsibility for and obtain resources to implement biodiversity
         conservation programs including control; and
    iii. Parana State Government officials across a number of secretaries and agencies who were in some
         way involved in, or accountable for, environmental conservation.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1: Education and Capacity Building (Total US$1.58m: GEF $1.21m + State
$0.37m)
The objective of this component was to (i) sensitize the population of Parana State to the importance of
biodiversity conservation, mobilizing it to support the process of recuperating and maintaining the quality


4
of the State's principal ecosystems, and (ii) prepare project implementing agencies, beneficiaries and
stakeholders to take part in the Project. Specifically, this component aimed to:
          change attitudes and behaviors and broaden knowledge, skills and competencies required for
             biodiversity conservation among stakeholders and environmental agents;
          build the requisite capacity among PBP executors to successfully carry out the project;
          persuade rural populations to adopt agricultural and husbandry technologies that are
             environmentally benign, especially in targeted interstitial areas;
          improve the efficiency, effectiveness and dedication of public officials directly or indirectly
             involved in activities impacting upon biodiversity conservation;
          implement effective biodiversity monitoring and evaluation systems; and
          involve civil society and especially NGOs within the State in project implementation.

Component 2: Biodiversity Management (Total US$26.74m: GEF $4.93m + State $21.81m)
The objective of the largest component of the project was to work with targeted rural producers in
interstitial areas and UC officials to assure the production and conservation activities promoted by the
project would improve the environmental integrity of the three corridors and thereby safeguard
biodiversity.
Specifically, this component aimed to:
           improve administration of the seven protected areas that are the geographic core of the
              corridors;
           shift to alternative, environmentally more benign production systems in interstitial areas;
           incorporate fragments of natural vegetation into the corridors through establishment of
              RPPN, protected areas or other means;
           increase connectivity of existing fragments and protected areas through microcatchment
              management ; and,
           rehabilitate degraded areas in selected microcatchments and Protected Areas (UC).

Component 3: Control and Protection (Total US$2.49m: GEF $1.16m + State $1.33m)
This component would address reform of the state environmental monitoring and evaluation, licensing
and enforcement functions, and the protection of threatened species. The specific objectives of this
component were to:
         Establish parameters for monitoring and evaluating the quality of biodiversity conservation;
         Develop and refine norms for licensing of activities with environmental impact in support of
           the decentralization of this function to regions;
         Support the decentralization of monitoring and control functions to select municipalities in
           the corridors which would require changing of IAP roles, elaboration of protocols, procedures
           and standards, and intensive training of IAP and municipal officials; and,
         Conduct research to identify endangered species and develop appropriate programs to protect
           them.

Component 4: Project Administration (Total US$2.05m: GEF $0.71m + State $1.34m)
        4.1      Project Administration
The basic project structure and organization was based upon the establishment of a PMU headed by the
Planning Secretariat, and staffed with representatives of the main implementing agencies (EMATER, the
agricultural extension agency, and IAP, the Environmental Institute of Parana) and supporting a
successful and often used State model that ensures project coordination by forming central, regional and
municipal management committees comprising relevant state officials whose secretariats and agencies
were also organized according to the three government tiers.




5
         4.2     Strategic Studies
This subcomponent would carry out the following major studies: i) identification and consolidation of
legislative aspects and norms regarding environment legislation at different levels of government, ii)
environmental certification, iii) identification and characterization of priority areas for conservation, iv)
cost-benefit of environmental interventions, v) improvement of ICMS ecologico ("Green" Value Added
Tax).

1.6 Revised Components

The components were not modified during implementation.

1.7 Other significant changes

In light of the findings of the Technical Audit conducted as part of the Mid-Term Review process (as
described in section 1.3), the following changes were made: (i) an extension of the closing date until
January 31, 2009; (ii) support to local civil society organizations interested in conducting environmental
studies, education activities or to improve infrastructure in order to promote decentralized conservation of
biodiversity through a new subcomponent, (Biodiversity Subproject Grants)- under Component 2 of the
Project; (iii) a revision of procurement provisions of the Grant Agreement; and (iv) a reallocation of funds
mainly to provide strengthening of the activities of the Environmental Institute of Parana (IAP). The
strengthening of the Advisory Committee was also contemplated in the restructuring as an efficient means
to get all stakeholders involved as well as to get feedback from them on the progress achieved by the
Project.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes  

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their mitigations
identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

Strategic Approach. Bank and GEF involvement was supported by the correct assessment of the
importance of Parana in terms of its environmental assets, particularly biodiversity. The two key, highly
endangered ecoregions that are widely represented within its boundaries are the Brazilian Inland Atlantic
Rainforest and the Araucaria Forest. The project was designed under the assumption that increasing
fragmentation of the remaining forests was primarily located in private properties (i.e., outside the
protected areas) and had the highest relevance-priority among critical factors affecting forest conservation
in the state. Therefore, the main project focus was on the protection and restoration of forest fragments
that could provide connectivity for species presently isolated in protected areas (see "Strategic Approach"
section of Annex 2 of the PAD).

Lessons learned and reflected in the project design. The first lesson incorporated in this project is the
management implications of the concept of fragmentation and ecological isolation of forest fragments as
key factors for biodiversity conservation. Although well established in academic circles for more than
three decades, it was only since the beginning of the present century that it was widely incorporated in
large scale conservation projects as one step beyond the classical single conservation unit.

Another important lesson incorporated into the project design was the multiple-focus strategic approach,
which encompassed site protection, law enforcement, community and stakeholder involvement, including
a very valuable attempt at integrating conservation and agriculture-oriented agencies. Past experience
also influenced the wide set of resources and incentives that were considered including enforcement (e.g.,
Legal Reserves, SISLEG) and incentive structures (e.g., ICMS Ecologico).


6
Decentralization was another leading criterion that emerged from previous GEF experience. Available
expertise from GEF's PROBIO has been especially important in supporting the identification of priority,
high biodiversity areas throughout Brazil, which have been incorporated into ARPA, the Ecological
Corridors operations. Decentralized monitoring through the project's creation of Municipal Biodiversity
Chambers and Regional Councils was another innovative concept resulting from past experiences derived
of extension activities originated in the agriculture sector in Parana.

Consistency. The project was conceived as fully consistent with the priorities of the country with respect
to both its main objective of biodiversity conservation in highly threatened forests and its regional focus
in the Inland Atlantic Forest and Araucaria Forest.

Project design. A major positive aspect of project design was to emphasize inter-agency and inter-
community interaction, including capacity building, development of production systems compatible with
biodiversity conservation, and incorporation of the local community and stakeholders in management and
monitoring of local and regional issues. More specifically, achieving an effective collaboration in project
planning and implementation activities of agriculture and conservation agents working together under the
coordination of Parana State planning authority represents a valuable, foresighted initiative. It responds
to an obvious (but frequently ignored) need for the development of effective tools for achieving an
integrated approach in terms of land-use, development, and ecosystem preservation.

Risk assessment. Risk identification was comprehensive and objective. Some identified risks become
reality during project implementation, including: a) possibility of corridor implementation delays because
several factors such as mapping and identification of specific sites using satellite imagery; b) delays in the
implementation of decentralized conservation enforcement and monitoring , and c) continued fiscal
problems result in budgetary retrenchment that undercut PBP development.

Adequacy of participatory process. Integration with the local community at all levels was very adequate.
This was a necessary requisite, taking into consideration that project vision was based on a strong
participatory process, including local land-owners, local NGOs, and Government agencies (planning,
biodiversity conservation and agriculture sectors) involved in common projects.

The success of this component would depend greatly upon activities under other components such as
refinement of incentive systems (ICMS Ecologico and SISLEG) and enforcement of existing regulations
governing water sources, riparian2 galleries, exploitation of natural resources, strengthening of
fiscalization and licensing through decentralization and legal reserves

2.2 Implementation
 (including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions taken,
as applicable)

Project changes/restructuring. During the first half of the project implementation period (September
2002-early 2005) overall implementation progressed in a satisfactory manner, with most project activities
showing acceptable progress, and commendable participation of implementing agencies, both at the
central and field levels. Despite this, GEF-financed activities of the project were implemented at a slower
pace than the NRM activities financed by the ongoing loan. The relatively slower implementation of the
biodiversity conservation component was mainly caused by disagreements over procurement procedures

2
 A riparian zone or riparian gallery (known as "mata ciliar" in Brazil) is the interface between land and a stream.
Plant communities along the river margins are called riparian vegetation.



7
between the new state administration in Parana (which took office in January 2003) and the Bank. The
result was an 18 month delay in the GEF-financed activities, and different rates of progress under the two
parts of the project.

The impact of slower than anticipated implementation of the GEF-financed activities was noticeable.
Due to slow implementation of the GEF-financed activities, the task team downgraded the Development
Objective and Implementation Progress ratings of the Project in June 2005. Following the resolution of
the procurement issue, execution of the GEF-financed activities of the project accelerated gradually,
balancing overall implementation. In 2006, a local NGO on behalf of a network called Rede Mata
Atlantica submitted a Request for Inspection to the Bank's Inspection Panel in 2006, criticizing the way
the Project was being implemented. The Requester's complaint was centered on "methodological
changes" made to Project implementation after it was approved that compromised the project's
biodiversity goals, as they resulted in lack of adequate attention and emphasis on the protection of
remaining patches of mature native Araucaria forests, as compared with the effort and resources dedicated
to restoration of degraded areas along the planned corridors in between protected areas.

 In response to this important allegation, the Bank decided to conduct a comprehensive Technical Audit,
in the context of the scheduled mid-term Review of the project. The Technical Audit recommended that it
would be appropriate to make certain modifications and adjustments in order to make the project more
effective in achieving its global objective of conserving biodiversity. Based on these recommendations,
the Grant Agreement was amended on February 2, 2007, approving a Second-Order Restructuring and
reallocation of funds, extending the closing date from January 31, 2007 to January 31, 2009.
Complementing the amendment, the State of Parana proposed an Action Plan for the remaining period of
the project, which was approved by the Bank. In this new Plan, several of the concerns presented by the
local NGO were addressed, particularly those referred to the Araucaria forest corridor. In the Project
Paper dated March 2007, additional indicators were established in order to monitor these operational
changes.

In March 2007 the Inspection Panel produced a report recognizing that there were efforts on the part of
the Bank and the Parana State Authorities to redirect the activities and the allocation of funds to make the
implementation of the Project more consistent with the biodiversity conservation objectives of the Project.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The project's initial design included key performance indicators for outcomes and intermediate outcomes
for the main objectives of the project (Biodiversity Management, Education and Capacity Building,
Control and Protection, and Project Administration). Indicator information at this level is considered to
be satisfactory overall, particularly for the operational monitoring. For the second phase of the project
(January 2007 to March 2009) output indicators were listed in the approved Action Plan Phase 2 prepared
by the agencies involved in project implementation Selected indicators were adopted in the Second-order
Restructuring Project Paper (March 13, 2007) as the formally revised output indicators for 2007-2009.

With regards to environmental monitoring, information available on the selected indicators is lacking to a
large extent. This lack is due to a great extent to the nature of the project. A significant delay between
implementation of conservation measures and biodiversity response is to be expected because of the
natural forest successional process in managed areas. Moreover, the studies being funded that aimed at
developing adequate monitoring methods were also delayed, from satellite image analysis to specific
methodology to particular indicator species such as parrots, felids, tapirs, monkeys, and epiphytes.

It would be very desirable therefore that monitoring of the long-term results of the project (particularly
restoration of forest patches along corridors) would continue to be implemented after project finalization,


8
for periods long enough to include successional vegetation changes and other long-term effects on
biodiversity.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The project complied with World Bank safeguard policies indicated in the PAD: (i) Environmental
Assessment and (ii) OP 4.04 Natural Habitats. Although OP 4.36 Forestry (March 1993) was not
applicable to the PBP at the time of approval, the project has applied the principles of this safeguard.

a. Environmental Assessment. The PBP has complied with all requirements under OP/BP 4.01
including those for the methodology and content of the EA, the EA rating and timing, and the EA
consultation process. An in-depth consultation on project objectives and components was held on August
24, 2000 with the State of Parana Association of Environmental NGOs (UNIAP), additional four NGOs,
and eight different governmental institutions involved in biodiversity conservation issues. The final draft
of the EA was received by the Bank and disclosed in the InfoShop on April 8, 2002. The EA was widely
disseminated among stakeholders and project beneficiaries in local language via the project website and
four meetings in the project corridors (April-June, 2002). An EA summarized the procedures for
subproject eligibility and screening. The EA found positive effects of the PBP on the environment,
noting in particular the institutional factors that allow for efficient application of enforcement through
various incentive schemes. NGOs continued to be involved in the project in various ways: in subgrants to
improve conservation of the Araucaria Biome, as trainers in Component 1, as part of the surveillance
teams under Component 3, in municipal and regional advisory committees, and in local forums.

b. Natural Habitats. The PBP took proactive measures to support natural habitats. There were no
identified project interventions that could cause any harm to, or loss of, such habitats. The primary
purpose of the OP4.04 is to ensure that Bank-supported project cause no harm to natural habitats, and
prohibits support for projects that would lead to the significant loss or degradation of any critical natural
habitats as defined in the policy. It is worth noting that the Request for Inspection was based on claims
for areas systematically destroyed, some of them under licenses issued by the State environmental agency,
the IAP." As the Inspection Panel's final eligibility report noted, concrete steps, including the
amendment of the Grant Agreement, were taken to ensure full project compliance with Bank policies.

c. Forestry. The PBP did not fund any logging or deforestation activities, legal or illegal. It also did not
include any provision to support tree planting for commercial use, be it a monoculture or a mixed species
field. Although there were significant areas of plantation forest in the project corridors (forestry for pulp
and paper) where logging is taking place, this logging was not supported by the project. The project
supported the reforestation only of areas cleared before the project began. Such reforestation took place
in properties inside the corridor necessary to ensure the connectivity between natural areas. It also uses a
mix of more than 20 local species and created permanent forested areas, in which no harvesting was
permitted. The PBP supported the operation of state-managed nurseries that produced high quality
seedlings of local species, including Araucária. The PBP distributed to farmers sets of seedlings to ensure
the growth of balanced forests. It also provided farmers with technical assistance regarding planting,
spacing, and maintenance and protection of the field. Based on the recommendation of the Technical
Audit, the project implemented Biodiversity Subprojects which supported civil society organizations to
promote conservation of the Araucária Forest.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Integrated Environmental Management Program in Microcatchments. Formal collaboration agreement
between IAP and Emater was signed to continue working together through a new state program,
Integrated Environmental Management Program in Microcatchments (PGAIM). PGAIM adopts the


9
methodology of the Paraná Biodiversity Project, both planning of microcatchments as well as
environmental education in a cooperative model. It operates throughout the State and with the
participation of a greater number of institutions. This new program will be operationalized through an
executive secretariat, in which the Project Director of PBP continues as the executive secretary. They will
also work in Prodesus, the project currently under preparation, expected to be financed by the Bank.

Parana Social Inclusion & Sustainable Development Project in Rural Areas. The State of Parana is
preparing a US$50 million loan titled the Parana Social Inclusion & Sustainable Development Project in
Rural Areas ­ Prodesus (ID:P097305) with the IBRD. Its objective is to increase rural competitiveness in
Central Region of Parana which would contribute to the overall strategy of the Government for helping
this region to catch up socioeconomically with other parts of the State. The PBP and the associated Rural
Poverty Alleviation and Natural Resources Management Project (1998-2006) have helped introduce
environmentally sound agricultural practices and promote environmental awareness. The proposed loan
would continue mainstreaming of sound land and water management practices into agricultural systems
and for protection of remnant natural vegetation in the Central Region which remains fragile with a high
concentration of poverty. The implementing agency is State Secretariat of Agriculture and Supply
(SEAB). State Secretariat of Planning and General Coordination (SEPL) and Parana's Institute of
Technical Assistance and Rural Extension (Emater) will be participating in the project. Currently the loan
is projected to go to the Board in March 2010.

IDB Loan. The State Government is also negotiating a US$10 million loan from the Inter-
American Development Bank to support the Projeto de Arranjos Produtivos Locais which would finance
small, local investments state-wide.


3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

This project had significant relevance in terms of objectives, design, and implementation, in the following
aspects:
1. Implementation of forest restoration as an integrated component of production systems in key
    conservation areas.
2. Implementation of a novel and useful institutional framework by which conservation and agriculture
    agencies worked together under the coordination of a state planning organism in projects that
    integrate conservation with sustainable use of natural resources.
3. Decentralization of planning and operational activities with strong participation of stakeholders and
    local communities.
4. Adequate flexibility and capacity to respond effectively to recommendations of the Inspection Panel
    and MTR and other consultants and reviewers.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives

The project aimed i) to support biodiversity conservation and sustainable natural resource management in
the Biodiversity Corridors with a view to protect two highly threatened ecoregions in the Parana state, and
ii) to design and implement a management model for improving biodiversity conservation in the
recipient's territory. These objectives were achieved to a large extent (see Table 1). Being of a clear
innovative nature, outcomes of the project provided useful, lessons, particularly in the area of institutional
development and inter-agency collaboration. The handling of unexpected situations, particularly
criticisms from local NGOs and administrative delays in the utilization of funds were also managed in a
positive way and adequate responses were implemented. More specifically, the project made significant


10
contributions in the following areas:
 Restoration of degraded forest areas along the forest corridors;
 Support for protected areas in the project area, including both state and private;
 Implementation of an integrated approach to management, biodiversity conservation and sustainable
    use of protected areas that includes collaboration and complementary work between conservation and
    agriculture agencies, in close interaction with the local communities and stakeholders;
 Emphasis in environmental education and capacity building of local communities regarding
    biodiversity conservation and sustainable use of natural resources;
 Improvement of the existing biodiversity monitoring systems with participation of the local
    communities (Environmental Monitoring Network);
 Research and management projects aiming at key management needs;
 Support of conservation initiatives from local NGOs;
 Support for community-generated sustainable agriculture and forest conservation projects in key
    conservation areas.

A detailed analysis of the achievements of the regarding PDO and GEO, as well as each of the key
indicators is provided below.

Forest restoration

Conservation of existing native forests and expansion of forested areas, particularly along the corridors
connecting important protected areas was one of the primary objectives of the project. The project largely
accomplished this objective through several integrated, complementary activities, that benefitted a total of
251,000 hectares , representing 75% of the initial target of 336,000 hectares. (See Annex 11: Images of
Restored Forests.) A total of 48,000 hectares were directly supported through implementation of 67
ecological modules, and an additional 18,000 hectares of forests were planned for conservation, and
registered. Riparian forest restoration covered 35,000 ha along watercourses (area estimation based on
35,000 km of forest conservation in gallery forest conservation/ restoration). The project also covered the
buffer zones of conservation units and their preservation area, totaling an area of 150,000 hectares.
According to Emater extensionists, this activity has provided demonstration sites for local landholders,
encouraging them to adopt new conservation criteria and techniques.
In addition, the project provided the means to develop planning and regulations for the Reservas Privadas
do Patrimônio Natural (RPPNs) system within IAP and to implement RPPNs. Thirty-two RPPNs were
created during the implementation of the Project, 16 during the first four years and 16 during the last two
years. Their area totals 14,520 hectares. The project also supported the NGO "Preservação" to undertake
the processes for the creation of 51 new RPPNs totaling 8,293 hectares: eight of them under the process
of landowners' decision; ten preparing the documentation for their proposals; one effectively created; and
the remaining 32 being processed by IAP. Together with the RPPNs already created, these RPPNs in
process are expected to bring the total area of new protected areas under private domain supported by the
Project to almost 23,000 hectares.
Despite the difficulties in assessing the effects of the biodiversity conservation and management
implemented in the PBP inherent to the slow process of forest recovery, satellite images indicate a clear
recovery of fragment connectivity in the area, which results mostly to the restoration of riparian
vegetation, and also to the addition of new RPPN units. Recovery is particularly visible along the Iguaçu-
Paraná e Caiuá-Ilha Grande corridors, and to a lesser extent in the Araucaria corridor. The difference is
that the main problem in the latter was not fragmentation, but poverty and high rate of deforestation.




11
Mainstreaming Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity

The biodiversity component produced significant outputs in several areas, including support for existing
protected areas and creation of additional units, which resulted in improved connectivity along forest
corridors linking important protected areas. Moreover, the project also promoted integration of
conservation and resource use in specially designed production systems (agro-ecological projects),
protected areas, regional planning and development, institutional capacity building at the institutional
level, environmental education and extension, and conservation projects and research.
Agro-ecological modules. Development and implementation of 67 agro-ecological projects that showed
the feasibility and benefits of developing production systems amenable with the environment that at the
same time included protection or generation of permanent protected areas of native forest was one of the
most positive and innovative outcomes of the project. Modules were very effective in adding native forest
land cover (through riparian vegetation restoration and in some cases creation of private reserves (RRPN),
increasing connectivity along corridors. Moreover, the modules also showed economic feasibility thanks
to the technological investment that the project provided to land owners.

Despite this, during the initial phases of the project there was an apparent disconnection between the
proposed activities and the primary objective of restoring and integrating degraded forest fragments into
functional corridors. Although all the selected subprojects had a conservation component (use of
environmentally-friendly techniques and products, and protection of the forest), they did not relate
directly with the essential priority in corridor management: to ensure continuity of suitable habitat
fragments that allow dispersal of biodiversity between protected areas. This issue was signaled in the
Mid-term Review. Originally, the ecological modules were considered demonstration projects of
production systems with potential aptitude for replacing predominant, production systems aggressive to
the environment. Accordingly, they supported a wide range of productive activities (including sugar cane
production, organic agriculture, dairy production, etc.). Protection of native biodiversity was encouraged,
but corridor management and conservation were not the central focus these grants.

This approach changed in the second phase of the project, as a result of the Mid Term Review. The
criteria for evaluation of subprojects included a specific focus on promoting connectivity between forest
patches of significant size. Moreover, selection of the new modules started to follow the results of
ecological evaluations of the corridors carried out by IAP.
Protected areas. The project contribute to the support of existing areas, to the creation of new areas, to
the management of degraded areas leading to the restoration of the native forest, and to the integration of
protected areas and production systems in innovative agro-ecological systems.
Support for existing protected areas focused on six state conservation units, including design and initial
implementation of Management Plans, involvement of the local communities in the conservation buffer
zones, and provision of new infrastructure in three units.
In addition to the RPPNs noted above, the Project also contributed to the creation of eight private reserves
"Reservas Privadas do Patrimônio Natural (RPPN)" program, in association with RPPN Paraná, a local
NGO. Two of these RPPNs are already approved, and five more are in the final phase of the approval
process. The creation of 15 more private reserves was also supported by the project, by providing
documentation and mapping processing: ten in the mapping and documentation stage; three with
approved surveys; and two more waiting for survey approval.
Regional planning and development. Along the project implementation period, strategic plans for the
design, implementation and conservation of the biodiversity modules were developed in cooperation by
State of Parana government agencies, particularly IAP and EMATER. They included detection of forest


12
fragments suitable for conservation (rapid assessment of corridors), as well as monitoring forest recovery
in restored areas and land-use planning in the protected areas buffer zones where agro-ecological modules
were implemented.
Moreover, Emater assessed the land-use present situation in the watershed basins selected by the Parana
Biodiversity Project, exploring opportunities for forest restoration as well as conflict areas. A land-use
map set for these basins is being developed and expected to be published during 2009.
Finally, the Paraná Biodiversity Project also supported the environmental restoration of micro-catchments
in the corridors area, which resulted in the protection of 3,500 km of riparian forest (35,000 hectares),
involving about 12,000 local residents. The technical assistance provided by Emater to help with planning
microcatchments also incorporated biodiversity contents and needs.
Capacity building at the institutional level. The Project provided significant benefits and incentives in
terms of capacity building at least to two Paraná government agencies: IAP and EMATER. IAP
Biodiversity Department developed a significant capacity for conservation planning, supported by
infrastructure, equipment, and human resources.
The same applies to Emater. With PBP support, a central planning unit and six satellite centers, fully
equipped, were implemented. Moreover, about 100 Emater professional and technical staff were trained
in remote sensing and geographic information system techniques. As a result, the State of Parana has in
place a regional planning system devoted to land-use planning, biodiversity conservation, and catchment
conservation.

Moreover the project also promoted and supported institutional capacity building at the state level, by
helping Instituto Ambiental do Paraná (IAP) to strengthen and expand its operational capacity,
particularly in terms of remote sensing and land-use planning area.
The project also benefited IAP by supporting activities at the state level, beyond the corridor areas. Of
particular relevance is the support provided to IAP to better implement and enforce the new federal
legislation on Mata Atlantica protection at the Parana state level.
Environmental education and extension. A wide range, intensive environmental education and
assistance scheme was implemented by Emater, with the coordination of one Corridor Manager for each
of the three corridors included in the project. A total of 65 Municipalities were benefited by the initiative.
The fact that Emater extensionists, specialized in agriculture, were trained to add environmental matters
in their work represents a very interesting and pioneering outcome of the Parana Biodiversity Project.
Conservation projects and research. During the second phase of the Project, several conservation and
research projects were funded. Consistent with the recommendations of the Mid Term Review, small
conservation projects were granted to local NGOs. A total of 41 subprojects were implemented, including
local awareness campaigns, carbon sequestration, analysis of legislation, and feasibility of introducing the
environmental services concept in the project, strategies for the conservation and monitoring of the 71
species for a wide and diverse group in different taxa have the commitment of the State to be
implemented. These action plans were developed for threatened birds and mammals, control of alien
invasive species, predation control by felids and domestic animals, meliponids, fish, and epiphytes.

Biodiversity monitoring: the project supported developing of a state biodiversity monitoring system,
which will contribute to the long-term conservation of biodiversity in the state. Activities included
biodiversity conservation in the long term including selection of indicator species (71) for baseline
evaluations, training of 150 field monitors, and training, extension and education activities. The 71
species identified as good monitoring units provided with the support of governmental, academic and
civil society contributions the establishment of baseline data base. To support this monitoring, 150
monitors were trained and adequately equipped, as well as staff of the Universidad Federal Parana,
Emater, NGOs, agro-ecological schools, local communities, IAP, SEMA and Municipalities.


13
    The project also funded activities for the SISFAUNA, a pioneering integrated information system based
    on the Pro-Fauna Network (on line database on wildlife).

    In addition , support to the meetings of the State Council for the Protection of Native Fauna -
    CONFAUNA (consultative and ruling body of the SISFAUNA) and the preparation of prioritized action
    plans for threatened species or particular issues dealing with specific biodiversity.
    Indicators. Despite the difficulties in assessing the effects of the biodiversity conservation and
    management implemented in the PBP inherent to the slow process of forest recovery, satellite images
    indicate a clear recovery of fragment connectivity in the area, which results mostly to the restoration of
    riparian vegetation, and also to the addition of new RPPN units. Recovery is particularly visible along the
    Iguaçu-Paraná e Caiuá-Ilha Grande corridors, and to a lesser extent in the Araucaria corridor.

                                      production systems

    3.3 Efficiency

    As required for a full-sized GEF project, an incremental cost analysis was done during the project
    preparation. No formal economic analysis was done over project implementation. Potentially the results
    of agro-ecological modules could be used for such economic analysis. However, the economic data of
    those modules could not be obtained at the time of this ICR, as they all combine tree plantation into the
    production system and they have not reached the maturity yet. It would take more than the time allowed
    under the PBP for the trees to produce benefits. The economic analysis of the modules will be done as
    part of the normal operation of Emater in a more established manner in the future.

    Agroecological modules. With respect to direct support to farmers, through the implementation of 67
    agroecological modules, the project granted an average of $ 1,620 per beneficiary (total invested:
    $2,322,511; total number of producers: 1,434). This level of direct support to producers through small
    grants is considered both acceptable and efficient (see Annex 3 for more details)

    Milk Production Module. While data from the project is very limited, this ICR attempts to demonstrate
    the valuation of outputs and inputs using the example of milk production in Boa Vista da Aparecida.
    Thirty local milk producers used to produce 2,390 liters/day, delivered to local merchants without quality
    control and sanitary treatment. Intermediary merchants would pay R$ 0.46/liter in average. If the
    producers sold directly to consumers, the price would have been R$ 0.75/liter. As a result, their
    association now produces 5,000 liter/day, commercializing at R$ 0.80/liter. The economic value of the
    milk production improved by the agro-ecological module is $ 1,534.00 (See Annex 3 for more details.)

    In addition to the productivity, the module brought about the environmental benefits from the
    revitalization of riparian forests and legal reserves on their lands. One producer is proud that groundwater
    returned to his 12 ha property which was converted to local natural attraction.

    It was noted that the gain obtained by organizing their productions through creation of associations and
    cooperatives was deemed significantly high. And it has already changed their attitude positively toward
    agro-ecological production. For example, milk producers observed that with the creation of the producers
    association the productivity went up, so did their negotiation power to obtain unified and adequate price.
    They have also eliminated the intermediary, distributing their own milk. Before, they did not even think
    about price. People paid whatever they wanted. Also the quality of their milk was considered low
    quality.

    Survey. The project also has conducted a survey to the environmental technical assistants of Emater who
    assisted the modules. According to the survey, there was an increase in productivity by 15% on average.
    For example, the annual production for livestock modules increased from R$15,142,888 to R$2,271,433.
    Some anecdotal examples are indicated below:

           i.     For honey agribusiness subprojects, there was an increase in income of up to 70% of the



    15
            producers, both by increase in average productivity from 12kg to 20kg per box per year, by
            the added value achieved from the industrialization of products, and by increased price from
            improved quality of honey (from R$2.00/kg to US$8.00/kg). A similar gain was repeated in
            Terra Roxa.

      ii.   The producers of medicinal plants of Inácio Martins have managed to diversify its production
            and to commercialize chamomile with significant gains.

     iii.   The carbon reduction producers, the Carbon Cooperative, have tentatively traded its first
            credits in the voluntary market. They are finalizing the legal arrangements of the cooperative
            and have good prospects of increasing its board membership with neighbors and producers in
            other regions.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Given the achievement or exceeding of two of the GEO outcome indicators and the reaching of a 75%
level of attainment for the indicator for sustainable use of biodiversity, the Parana Biodiversity Project's
overall outcome rating is deemed moderately satisfactory in achieving conservation of globally important
biodiversity

The key activity of agro-ecological modules was successfully implemented in a significant number of
sites along the corridors. Lack of completion of some objectives, particularly the Control and
Enforcement component and lower disbursement that affected significant infrastructure components such
as the Wildlife Management Center (CEMA) were to a large extent a consequence of unexpected
institutional and administrative problems, which were identified as potential risks in the initial PAD. The
project also achieved significant contributions to the protected areas in the Parana State, including support
to six State Conservation Units, as well as support for the creation of new, private reserves (RPPNs).

Moreover, changes introduced into the project after the Mid-Term Evaluation and Technical Audit and
their following implementation during the project's second phase demonstrated the project's capacity to
correct and improve its development course, as shown by a significant recovery of Phase I delays and the
introduction of new components, including the recruitment of consultants and services with strong
participation from local NGOs. Another significant merit of the project is the successful integration of
four state agencies working together under the coordination of the Planning authorities working as a
neutral management unit.

Finally, it is also worth mentioning that the Education Component has implemented a wide range of
activities reaching a large number of rural communities (both adults and children), which usually have
less opportunities of reaching this kind of innovative, updates information directly related with their
environment and way of living.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Making conservation compatible with agro-ecosystems

Implementation of agro-ecological modules represents a very valuable initiative and an important step
forward towards the important goal of making compatible intensive land use with biodiversity
conservation. Moreover, this kind of on-site projects gives preeminence to a problem-oriented vision, in
contrast with the traditional agency-oriented approach, opening a wide range of opportunities for multi-


16
disciplinary and transversal approaches at different scales, particularly within the regional context.

Moreover, it is also very significant the role played by PBP on working with small landholders in
conserving and organizing their lands, including the conservation of riparian forests.

Supporting existing protected areas versus restoring degraded land

One important outcome of the project was the complaint raised by local NGOs regarding the need to
prioritize existing mature forest patches of the native forests (Mata Atlantica and Araucaria Forest)
instead of focusing on the forest restoration in degraded land along the vegetation corridors between
important protected areas.

From a conceptual point of view, it is clear that both are clear priorities of a complementary nature.
Clearly, preserving large and mature patches of forest is key in terms of minimizing the risk of extinction
of many species that are exclusive of this forest successional stage and strongly related with the size of
the forest fragment At the same time, restoring degraded land with native vegetation is very significant in
terms of catchment and soil protection, in addition to the creation of stepping stones for biodiversity that
increases the effective area of the existing protected sites.
At the moment of the Parana Biodiversity Project design, it was assumed that existing protected areas and
remaining forest patches under private ownership were protected by the existing State regulations.
Accordingly, emphasis was given to a novel, complementary approach to biodiversity conservation based
on the need of increasing connectivity between isolated forest fragments, complementary of ongoing
existing catchment protection and riparian forest protection initiatives.

From a general perspective, the lesson to be incorporated is that implementation of future initiatives of
similar nature to the Parana Biodiversity Project should add to the initial diagnostic evaluation the real
conservation status and threats of both existing protected areas and fragments under private ownership,
and establish restoration priorities accordingly.

In summary, the valuable experience gained in the Parana Biodiversity Project indicates that management
planning of threatened ecoregions should be designed at a higher landscape level. In the case of the State
of Parana, this project has helped to raise the capacity level of two agencies (Emater and IAP) in terms of
both material and human resources. Both are now fully capable of dealing with the above mentioned
landscape planning challenge.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

As mentioned in the previous section, the fact that the Project achieved effective coordination and
collaboration between agencies within the Parana State Government represents a very significant step
towards institutionalization of transversal collaboration and interactions among government agencies, an
essential component of sound environmental policies and actions. As the process not only involved
institutions, but also staff that was benefited from training courses, it is likely the project will have a long
lasting influence on the government structures of the Parana State.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

Administrative issues
Differences in accounting criteria between the Bank and the Brazilian "Tribunal de Contas do Estado"
regarding financial procedures led to significant delays in the Project implementation leading to
undisbursement of some funds at the end of project. Moreover, consultancies of the State Fauna System
and biological monitoring were also cancelled.


17
Wildlife Management Center. The planned building of the proposed Wildlife Management Center in
Palotina was not contracted. This is probably the most critical negative result of the project in terms of
infrastructure. Cancellation of this plan was caused by restrictions imposed by the recipient
administrative authorities that delayed contracts to a point when construction was no longer feasible. In
contrast, technical equipment for another Management Center was purchased as scheduled. The IAP has
committed to budget the construction and to staff the Palotina Center during 2009-10.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

As part of the Mid-term Review of the project, two workshops were organized to analyze the Technical
Audit report, presented by their authors. Attendance was open to governments (State and Municipal),
NGOs, academia and other interested sectors of the civil society. Contributions and comments presented
by the attendants during these events helped to restructure the Project, define the main elements of the
second phase, and eventually to the extension of the closing date.

A second workshop was conducted in Curitiba on September 10, 2009 with the objective of disseminating
project's results and share with the general audience the impact and ongoing activities. This workshop
was chaired by high authorities of the Secretariats of Planning, Environment and Agriculture, as well as
EMATER and IAP. The Bank presented the main conclusions of the project´s final evaluation and
recommendation for future actions in favor of biodiversity conservation. The State authorities shared the
different mechanisms put in place and those to be developed to sustain the project's achievements. The
event was attended by over 120 participants, including technical staff of relevant government agencies,
academia and civil society and was well covered by the state press.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

Formal collaboration agreement of different state agencies and institutions has assured the continued
support for project objectives. IAP and Emater signed an agreement of cooperation to continue working
together through a new state program, Integrated Environmental Management Program in
Microcatchments (PGAIM). They will also work together in Prodesus, the loan currently in preparation
with the Bank. PGAIM adopts the methodology of the Paraná Biodiversity Project, both planning of
microcatchments as well as environmental education in a cooperative model. It operates throughout the
State and with the participation of a greater number of institutions. This new program will be
operationalized through an executive secretariat, in which the Project Director of PBP continues as the
executive secretary.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)
5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank preparation team and management provided adequate attention to the design of an innovative
and challenging project and made efforts to ensure the balanced project design in terms of strategic
approach, technical and financial aspects, components, implementation arrangements, fiduciary aspects,
and monitoring and evaluation arrangements. This also included the appropriate link and blend of project
design with the implementation of the Natural Resources Management Project.



18
Risk identification was comprehensive and objective. However, some identified risks became reality
during the project implementation, including: a) possibility of corridor implementation delays because
several factors such as mapping and identification of specific sites using satellite imagery; b) delays in the
implementation of decentralized conservation enforcement and monitoring , and c) continued fiscal
problems result in budgetary retrenchment that undercuts PBP development. And the mitigation measures
identified were not enough to overcome some of those risks.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank task team conducted a total of 17 supervision missions during the implementation of the
project, where the mission provided adequate inputs and processes to the recipient and beneficiaries.
Fifteen Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) were filed with straightforward reporting on the issues
focusing on the implementation progress and its impact on the achievement of project objectives.

When the Government's procurement issues were identified, the task team pressed the Government to
address the issues. After the issues were resolved in 2005, it conducted a full performance review and
developed and guided the project to implement a four-month plan (Sep-Dec `05) with a detailed budget
and targets for 42 indicators.

During the Inspection Panel process, the task team and Bank management worked swiftly to respond to
the Inspection Panel. The task team followed up the case by conducting a comprehensive technical audit,
as part of the mid-term review. The recommendations from these reviews were critical for preventing a
full investigation by the Panel and for the successful outcomes in the second half of the project
implementation.

However, the Bank did not make an effort to revise the target value for one of the outcome indicators
despite having identified the issue of substantially reduced co-financing from the IBRD loan (Parana 12
Meses) for farmers to adopt the alternative production systems to help protect or restore forested areas.
As a result, the overall achievement in terms of hectares on which alternative production systems were
adopted reached only75% of the target value, though the project provided the planned level of GEF
resources for direct support to producers through small grants. For this reason, the quality of supervision
is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

As per OPCS guidelines on ICRs, Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory because quality of
supervision has been rated Moderately Satisfactory while quality at entry has been rated Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Parana State Government has demonstrated their ability and commitment to achieve development
objectives in general. Adequate support by the Government has been provided throughout the preparation


19
and the implementation. It was reconfirmed through the restructuring exercise based on the
recommendations from the technical audit to adequately involve civil society organizations in the project
implementation.

However, when the project faced lack of co-financing from the Parana 12 Meses loan, the Government of
Parana failed to obtain an alternative source of funding to fill the gap. The low disbursement of the loan
from NRM Project (Parana 12 Meses) was due to three factors: 1) the requirement of the State Court of
Accounts (Tribunal de Contas do Estado) that all procurements were made in a centralized manner via
electronic bidding, a new system for both the project staff and service providers who were unprepared and
needed time to learn the system; 2) procurement procedures was affected by the interpretation of the
Tribunal de Contas do Estado that procedures should follow Law 8.666 instead of World Bank
procedures; and 3) the timing of the loan which closed in 2005. By the time the procurement issues
finally resolved in 2005, the loan was closed. The Government did not supplement it with other source of
funding when it was clear that lack of support from Parana 12 Meses was affecting the implementation of
the agro-ecological modules.

Also most activities requiring the recruitment of consultants had been delayed due to the administration's
requirement that all contracts have to be reviewed and authorized by the office of the Governor and, in
some cases, sent to the Procuradoria for further review. Especially, contracts of NGOs and consultancies
had to go through rigid review, which affected the conservation activities introduced after the
restructuring.

In the last twelve months, the state government made positive steps toward meeting their commitments.
The issue showed strong improvement as all consultancies and the granting scheme for NGO subprojects
were authorized and the UGP was able to process the contracts before the project execution period ended.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The inter-institutional arrangement among SEPL/SEAB/SEMA/IAP/Emater functioned well for the
implementation of the project, consequently for the achievement of the project objectives.

The agencies demonstrated their commitment and ability to adhere to the "Four-month Plan" (Sep-Dec
2005) which was developed following the full performance review by the Bank team. In May 2006,
compliance of 91% with the indicators was confirmed. Areas where further progress was required were
monitored closely and subsequently improved.

The State agencies together reacted swiftly and positively to the Inspection Panel case by holding
consultations with NGOs and presenting the Action Plan which incorporated the recommendations from
the consultations and the Technical Audit. As a result, the second half of the project implementation
contributed positively to the achievement of the project objectives, including: (i) stronger participation of
civil society, especially in the Araucaria area; (ii) biodiversity subprojects to be carried out by NGOs, and
(iii) structural changes in the State Secretariat of Environment to promote a stronger system of monitoring
and enforcement. In the last 12 months, all project components and subcomponents progressed
satisfactorily.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory



20
As per OPCS guidelines on ICRs, it is rated moderately satisfactory because government performance is
rated moderately satisfactory while implementing agencies performance is rated satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

The importance of a transversal, multi-sectorial approach to GEF projects. The success of the
Parana Biodiversity Project, even considering the difficulties that emerged along its development,
strongly suggests that there is an added value in trying to promote this innovative approach. Moreover, it
could be further expanded by including more government agencies, NGOs with different, complementary
profiles, the Academic and Research, as well as other relevant sectors of the civil society. Even if
challenging and difficult to implement, developing a better and wider coordination and integration
between government sectors and other non-governmental institutions is becoming an urgent need in face
of the growing environmental problems that affect the whole planet.

Given its innovative and somewhat experimental nature, it is important to bear in mind that even errors,
difficulties and unexpected outcomes resulting from this project provide very useful experience and
insight applicable to future projects of similar intersectoral and transversal nature.

Monitoring and indicators. Because of its long-term nature, adequate indicators for projects like the
Parana Biodiversity Program are very difficult to design and measure. However, it would be extremely
useful in case monitoring of the effects of the project is not continued. Otherwise, a great deal of useful
information may be lost. At least two critical questions need to be answered: a) to what extent the agro-
ecological projects resulted in a permanent, effective restoration of forest fragments?; and b) to what
extent interaction and coordination between conservation and agriculture agencies remained well
established after the end of the project? These are the two more sensitive, reliable and synthetic indicators
of the success of this project, as well as relatively easy to monitor. In both cases, understanding of the
factors influencing both success and failures will be of great importance for future projects.

It would be very desirable that monitoring of the long-term results of projects of this nature (particularly
restoration of forest patches along corridors) would continue to be implemented after project finalization,
for periods long enough to include successional vegetation changes and other long-term effects on
biodiversity.

Technical resources. From a technical perspective, some of the practices supported by the agro-
ecological modules and biodiversity evaluation and monitoring could be improved in future projects,
particularly in the following cases.

Agro-ecological Modules: It would be useful to explore (or develop) more advanced restoration models,
beyond the provision of pioneer and secondary tree species seedlings and the fencing of areas for natural
restoration through exclusion of productive activities, considering that the latter only proved effective
when appropriate genetic material was present. Effective forest restoration should mimic the natural
successional process, which requires a sequence of different plant species (from pioneer to climax
species) that allow soil and microclimatic factors to restore.  
Evaluation and monitoring: this activity may require a more sophisticated approach in the future, given
that detecting changes in biodiversity is usually difficult in tropical forests, where a sophisticated
statistical design is required, which can only be accomplished by specialists. Training of field assistants
for biodiversity monitoring is an important first step, but insufficient in most cases. Indeed, the fact that
some of the research projects granted in the second phase of the project focused on species monitoring
indicate that the need was perceived by project management.



21
Ecological services: Agro-ecological modules implicitly recognized the value of the native forest in terms
of biodiversity and river basin protection as a key reason for financing agro-ecological modules. A
possible missed opportunity is the explicit inclusion of the ecosystem services concept as a conservation
tool. Ecosystem services were excluded from the list of economic alternatives with potential to promote
river basin protection and forest corridor restoration. However, a more explicit recognition of the
ecological services concept could help local communities to better understand the value of their forests.
A study produced during the second phase of the project on economic incentives for conservation shows
that the ecosystem service concept is, among others, present in the Brazilian legislation.

Institutional integration and coordination. Problems related with Project Administration that emerged
along this project (particularly those related with financial administration and decentralization of wildlife
fiscalization and control) suggest that as projects become more complex and inter-sectoral, conflicts of
this nature are more likely to arise. Therefore, it would be important in future projects to resource to all
the available mechanisms that may contribute to eliminate beforehand as many potential difficulties of
this kind as possible.

Changes in government support. At the time when the Parana Biodiversity Project was planned, the
State Government of Parana had showed a strong commitment and support for environmental protection.
Accordingly, the project was designed under the assumption that the State authorities will support
innovative approaches and their effective implementation. After elections in 2002 the new authorities did
not embrace the government commitment with the same emphasis. As a result, project implementation
suffered both administrative delays and changes in priorities that affected the normal development of
planned activities in several components.

NGOs' request for Inspection

As described previously, a local NGO on behalf of a network called Rede Mata Atlantica submitted a
Request for Inspection to the Bank's Inspection Panel in 2006, criticizing the way the Project was being
implemented. The Requester's complaint was centered on "methodological changes" made to Project
implementation after it was approved that compromised project success, particularly in reference to the
following technical aspects.

     1)    A critical shift from the initial emphasis in the protection of the last well-preserved natural
          forests, such as the Araucaria Forest, to a higher priority (in terms of resource allocation) given to
          the recovery of degraded areas. This shift in priority was negative because could jeopardize the
          future of the most valuable, mature forest fragments, as compared with much lower chances of
          ensuring biodiversity protection by restoring degraded areas. This change in priority was
          considered a "serious strategic error" because it implied missing the last opportunity to preserve
          the region's biodiversity.

     2) The continued destruction of natural areas through illegal removal of timber, mismanagement,
        replacement of native forests with tree monocultures, and agriculture expansion after
        deforestation, in some cases with the endorsement the Paraná Environmental Institute (IAP).

An Inspection Panel was triggered to deal with the above mentioned complains. As part if it's response to
the allegations made, the Bank recommended an independent Technical Audit (TA), as suggested also by
the Requesters, which was conducted in 2006, in the context of the Mid-term Review of the project.

The overall conclusion of the TA was that "the project is a well-developed and advanced initiative, which
has achieved positive planned objectives". In addition, the TA proposed increased focus and attention on
actions to conserve the remaining forest remnants, especially for Araucaria forests, including financing of
activities to be carried out by local NGOs working in biodiversity conservation.

In March 2007, the Inspection Panel produced a report recognizing that there were efforts on the part of
the Bank and the Parana State Authorities to redirect the activities and the allocation of funds to make the
implementation of the Project more consistent with the objectives of the Project to conserve biodiversity.
Therefore, the Panel did not recommend a full investigation of whether the Bank has complied with its
operational policies and procedures. Subsequently, changes in the Grant Agreement and a reallocation of
funds were proposed and approved. Moreover, the closing date for disbursements under the Grant
Agreement was extended to January 31, 2009.

The second phase of the project (2007-2009) incorporated comments and suggestions of the Technical
Audit particularly by increasing support to the existing State protected areas, promotion of the private
reserve system (RRPN), a more focused emphasis of the agro-ecological models on forest restoration and
forest corridor continuity, and a small-grant program, aimed at financing NGO-proposed conservation and
research projects aiming at improving biodiversity conservation and sustainable management in the State
of Parana, particularly in the corridors .

The NGOs initiative had a strong influence on project outcomes during the last two years of the project.
It resulted in a corrective response from the Project Management leading to the successful incorporation
of new activities that improved the overall achievements of the project. In first place, the NGOs request
led to a detailed review of the project. In addition, the Bank initiative of conducting a Technical Audit in
place resulted in a comprehensive assessment and useful recommendations for change and improvement.
The Inspection Panel document provided, on top of its final conclusions, useful comments that help to
understand and evaluate the conflicting issues and their implications, which may be seen as useful lessons
for future projects of similar scope.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis  
As required for a full-sized GEF project, an incremental cost analysis was done during the project
preparation. No formal economic analysis was done over project implementation. Potentially the results
of agro-ecological modules could be used for such economic analysis. However, the economic data of
those modules could not be obtained at the time of this ICR, as they all combines tree plantation into the
production system and they have not reached the maturity yet. It would take more than the time allowed
under the PBP for the trees to produce benefits. The economic analysis of the modules will be done as
part of the normal operation of Emater in a more established manner in the future.

Agro-ecological Modules

The agro-ecological modules support community ventures to use agricultural and livestock technologies
that have low impact on the environment. The modules aim at demonstrating the environmental benefits
for the existing production systems. The PBP supported 67 agro-ecological modules, benefitting 1,434
rural producers with the total investments of $ 2,322,511 The counterpart funding provided by the
beneficiaries was calculated at $ 2,758,732.

     While data from the project is very limited, this ICR attempts to demonstrate the valuation of outputs and
     inputs using the example of milk production in Boa Vista da Aparecida. Thirty local milk producers used
     to produce 2,390 liters/day, delivered to local merchants without quality control and sanitary treatment.
     Intermediary merchants would pay R$ 0.46/liter in average. If the producers sold directly to consumers,
     the price would have been R$ 0.75/liter. The PBP invested R$ 120,000 for their participation in the agro-
     ecological module combining forestry/forest restoration with agro-industry. Equipments were purchased



     30
to increase productivity and technical assistance was provided by the State extensionists.

As a result, their association now produces 5,000 liter/day, commercializing at R$ 0.80/liter. In addition
to the productivity, the module brought about the environmental benefits from the revitalization of
riparian forests and legal reserves on their lands. One producer is proud that groundwater returned to his
12 ha property which was converted to local natural attraction.

The gross economic benefit of this module is given by the non-incremental output times the average
supply price plus the incremental output times the average demand price. The average supply price is
derived from the without module cost of R$ 0.46/liter and the with module cost of R$ 0.80/liter. The
average supply price is R$ 0.63/liter. The average demand price is the average cost of milk/liter without
and with the module. The price is R$ 0.75/liter without and R$ 0.80/liter with, giving an average demand
price of R$ 0.775.

The gross economic benefit for the Boa Vista da Aparecida agro-ecological module can be calculated
from the non-incremental and incremental outputs and the economic supply and demand prices. These
gross economic benefits can be compared with the revenue to the new milk producers, which will be
5,000 liter/day at R$ 0.80/liter, or R$ 4,000. The resulting conversion factor is 0.565, which can be
applied to the revenue accruing to the new milk producers to derive the economic value of the milk
production.

The economic value of the milk production improved by the agro-ecological module is R$ 3,528.45.

It was noted that the gain obtained by organizing their productions through creation of associations and
cooperatives marked significantly high. And it has already changed their attitude positively toward agro-
ecological production. For example, milk producers observed that with the creation of the producers
association the productivity went up, so did their negotiation power to obtain unified and adequate price.
They have also eliminated the intermediary, distributing their own milk. Before, they did not even think
about price. People paid whatever they wanted. Also the quality of their milk was considered low
quality.

The project also has conducted a survey to the environmental technical assistants of Emater who assisted
the modules. According to the survey, there was an increase in productivity by 15% on average. For
example, the annual production for livestock modules increased from R$15,142,888 to R$2,271,433.

Some anecdotal examples are indicated below:


31
       i.   For honey agribusiness subprojects, there was an increase in income of up to 70% of the
            producers, both by increase in average productivity from 12kg to 20kg per box per year,
            by the added value achieved from the industrialization of products, and by increased price
            from improved quality of honey (from R$2.00/kg to US$8.00/kg). A similar gain was
            repeated in Terra Roxa.

      ii.   The producers of medicinal plants of Inácio Martins have managed to diversify its
            production and to commercialize chamomile with significant gains.

     iii.   The carbon reduction producers, the Carbon Cooperative,, have tentatively traded its first
            credits in the voluntary market. They are finalizing the legal arrangements of the
            cooperative and have good prospects of increasing its board membership with neighbors
            and producers in other regions.
