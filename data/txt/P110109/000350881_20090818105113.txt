                 GRANT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
             LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
PROPOSED FIFTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT OPERATION


    Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR)
    Ministry o f Finance

     IDA Grant
     Terms: Standard IDA grant terms
    Amount: SDR 12.9 million (US$20 million equivalent).
     The proposed Fifth Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO-5) i s the second
     operation o f the second programmatic series o f four operations (PRSOs 4-7). PRSO-5 i s a
     single tranche operation and has been processed under IDA Financial Crisis Response
     Fast-Track Facility .
     PRSO-5 focuses on two broad policy areas which are consistent with the goals anc
     strategies identified by the Government in the National Socio-Economic Development Plar
     2006-10 (NSEDP). The NSEDP successfully incorporated the key principles o f ar
     effective Poverty Reduction Strategy. The priorities o f the NSEDP are reflected in IDA':
     Country Assistance Strategy and focus on:
          0      sustaining growth through improvement o f the investment climate, facilitating
                 trade and management o f natural resources;
          0      improving social outcomes through better public financial management system and
                 service delivery.
    In addition, the PRSO-5 i s based on continued adequacy o f the macroeconomic
    framework, reflective o f the Government's effort to manage the impacts o f the global
    economic crisis and i t s commitment to macroeconomic stability. The operation has been
    jointly prepared by the Government and IDA, in close collaboration with AusAID, the
    European Commission and Japan.
    Within the NSEDP framework, the PRSO-5 aims to support Lao PDR in two key focus
    areas:
         0       Improving the investment climate, competitiveness, and business development in
                 order to establish an environment conducive to sustainable export- and private
                 sector-driven growth;
         0       Strengthening the overall public finance management framework to enable the
                 Government to increase efficiency o f the public resource allocation system,
                 strengthen fiduciary controls, and improve service delivery.
    Reforms in these areas have improved the Government's ability to manage the impact of
    the economic crisis, particularly on the financial sector, and to cushion to some extent the
    shortfalls in budgetary revenues resulting from it. The PRSO series expects to contribute
    to a l i s t o f outcomes and indicators as follows: (i) streamlining o f regulations for setting
    up and operating business as measured by the number o f days it takes to start up a
    business; (ii) streamlining o f cross-border procedures to reduce trade barriers;
    (iii) reduction in SOE losses, greater transparency and commercial viability; more modern
    and better performing banking sector; (iv) improved credibility o f budget planning,
    transparency and comprehensiveness o f budget reporting; and faster budget execution;
    (v) timeliness and quality o f external audits; (vi) improving service delivery and
    management, allocation, and monitoring o f education expenditures; and (vii) improved
    access to health care and financial protection; effective performance monitoring for health
    sector policy.
Program          PRSO-5 aims to support the Government's priorities as outlined in i t s NSEDP and
Development      supported by the CAS, namely by: (i)sustaining growth through improved investment
Objectives and   climate and competiveness; and (ii) improving social outcomes by improving the quality of
Contributionto   the public finance management framework and service delivery mechanism in the health
CAS.             and education sectors. PRSO-5 will contribute to the achievement o f these objectives
                 through improving management o f key areas (regional integration, private sector
                 development, and quality of investment in natural resource sector) and through
                 strengthening of public financial management and service delivery capacities and targeted
                 poverty reduction programs.

                 The PRSO policy reform program i s supported by complementary technical assistance
                 from the World Bank and other development partners, in order to ensure that the
                 Government receives comprehensive policy and implementing support to execute i t s
                 reform program effectively. The European Commission, Japan and Australia will also
                 provide parallel financing to the Government within the PRSO-5 framework.

                 The grant amount for this operation i s increased by US$10 million from the volume
                 programmed in the CAS on the basis o f government's need for additional financing to
                 bridge the financing gap that has emerged in the FY2008/09 budget on account of a
                 shortfall in revenues due to the impact o f the global financial crisis.
                 There are four main risks that could affect the proposed operation:

                 High fiduciary risk due to a weak public financial management system. The weak financial
                 management and monitoring system could result in PRSO fund diversion away from
                 NSEDP priorities, and coverage o f losses of SOCBs and SOEs. This risk i s mitigated by a
                 strong PFM program and complemented by a monitoring regime of SOE and SOCB
                 performance embedded in the PRSO program matrix.

                 Capacity constraints, skills shortage in the civil service. I t i s mitigated by additional
                 resources made available for the PRSO via the FMCBP, and analytical work led by the
                 World Bank to improve the pay and compensation structure. The UNDP i s providing
                 assistance to the Government on strengthening civil service performance management
                 system.

                 Provincial autonomy without adequate monitoring and accountability mechanisms
                 hampers implementation of national policies and equitable distribution of resources. This
                 risk i s mitigated through a TA on public financial management focusing on
                 implementation o f the new Budget Law that mandates increased central government
                 oversight on expenditure execution and revenue collection.

                 Potential deterioration o the macroeconomic situation in the wake o the global financial
                                          f                                            f
                 crisis, may lead to a sharp increase in contingent liabilities in the state-ownedfinancial
                 sector, arrears to utility companies and private contractors, as well as pressures on
                 expenditures. The PRSO operation and Lao PDR country program mitigate this risk by the
                 following avenues: (i) through strengthened macroeconomic monitoring; (ii) providing
                                                                                                by
                 direct general budget support to fill the financing gap created as a result of the financial
                 crisis; (iii)assisting government put in place appropriate policies and institutional
                 mechanism for improved expenditure management; (iv) policy actions that limit the
                 accumulation o f arrears to the electricity utility; (v) a financial sector component that
                 includes SOCB monitoring and strengthens bank supervision.

 .
I INTRODUCTION

1.       A combination o f the global financial crisis and expenditure commitments due to the South
East Asian games to be held in December 2009 have created a challenging macroeconomic
environment for Lao PDR. The impact o f the global financial crisis i s felt through declining commodity
export prices, reduced FDI inflows and remittance income, as well as a decline in non-resource exports,
especially agriculture. Tourism and manufacturing (garments) have been less affected by the crisis but
remain vulnerable. Real GDP growth in 2009 i s projected to slow to about 5 percent, as the impacts o f the
global financial crisis are felt in the domestic economy. Macroeconomic conditions remain relatively
stable, although trends in credit growth and quasi-fiscal operations raise concerns regarding a change in the
Government's past policy o f monetary and fiscal discipline. As noted in the Government's Letter o f
Development Policy (See Annex l), Government i s planning to rein in credit growth and phase out
                                       the
quasi-fiscal operations by end-2009, as well as maintain sustainable budgets for FY2008/09 and
FY2009/10, (see below).

2.       I t will be important for Lao PDR to continue the financial sector and public financial
management reforms. There i s a need for intensifying monitoring o f the banking sector in order to detect
early signs o f financial distress and take corrective measures in a timely manner. At the same time reforms
aimed at deepening the financial sector will be important to ensure appropriate financial intermediation
continues. The importance o f continuing public financial management reforms i s reinforced by the fact
that: (i)there will be fewer resources available for some time to come and therefore available resources
would need to be deployed more efficiently and managed effectively; and (ii)       improved resource allocation
and use o f public resources will be key to maintaining aggregate demand, production, and employment, as
well as ensuring that the poor are protected from the worst effects o f the crisis.

3.      The I M F ' s recent Article I V Consultations' noted that the medium-term outlook is positive
provided that macroeconomic stability i s maintained and structural reforms continue. The following
external and domestic risks to the macroeconomic outlook were also highlighted: (1) on the external side, a
slower than expected global recovery would mean more delays in construction o f power plants, and further
depress demand for tourism, garments and other exports, (2) on the domestic side, excessively
expansionary monetary and fiscal policies may jeopardize macroeconomic stability, and (3) significant
delays in implementation o f reforms to improve the investment climate could hinder the broader
development o f the economy.

4.       The World Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Lao PDR, discussed by the
Executive Directors on May 4,2007, builds on the Government's NSEDP, with the PRSO program
being the center piece o f the strategy. The PRSO program squarely supports the four pillars o f the CAS:
(i) sustain growth through improved management o f key drivers - regional integration and private sector
development, rural development, and natural resource management; (ii)     improve social outcomes and
reduce vulnerability through strengthened public financial management and service delivery capacities and
targeted poverty reduction programs; (iii)adopt a strategic approach to capacity development and
partnership in support o f better NSEDP results; and (iv) support the implementation o f N a m Theun 2
(NT2) hydro-power project, focusing on the revenue management arrangements. PRSO-supported reforms

are timely for improving the public financial management framework, as significant resources will accrue
to the Government fiom the NT2 project and other natural resource sector developments.

5.      The proposed PRSO-5 i s the second operation o f the second programmatic series o f PRSOs
in the Lao PDR, which was approved by the Board o f Executive Directors of ID A on June 17,2008.
The PRSO-5 seeks to continue the focus on the areas consistent with the goals and strategies identified by
the Government in the NSEDP. A Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) was discussed by the I M F and World
Bank Boards in June 2008. The PRSO-5 has been jointly prepared by the Government and IDA, in close
collaboration with AusAID, the European Commission and Japan.

6.       Lao PDR has demonstrated significant progress in reducing poverty, however the global
financial crisis i s likely to slow progress. The poverty headcount f e l l from almost half the population in
 1997/98 to one-third in 2002103 while the share o f the population in poverty was reduced by 30 percent,
lifting one-eighth o f the total population out o f poverty. Even though the population grew by one million
people over this period, the absolute number o f the poor declined from about 2.1 million to 1.9 million.
The Lao PDR Poverty Assessment showed that the greatest reductions in poverty headcount happened in
the areas that were selected by the Poverty Reduction Strategy (NSEDP) as priority districts for poverty
reduction efforts, including targeted interventiom2 Preliminary results from the fourth round o f the Lao
Expenditure Consumption Survey (LECS) indicate that poverty has continued to decline (to approximately
27 percent in 2007/08) - see Section I1 for progress with poverty reduction). The impact o f the global
financial crisis will challenge the poverty reduction record o f the country and there will be need for
proactive monitoring o f poverty incidence as the impact of the global crisis continues to unfold.

7.      Policy dialogue under PRSO-5 i s focused on two broad areas: (i)    sustaining growth through
improvement o f the investment climate, facilitating trade and management o f natural resources;
(ii)improving social outcomes through better public financial management systems and service delivery,
as detailed in Section V. Progress in the past 12 months shows that the Government's commitment to
reform has been sustained in the two areas supported by PRSO-5 strategy:

        0   sustaining growth through improvement o the investment climate, facilitating trade and
                                                         f
            management o natural resources - improving the legislative framework for the minerals
                          f
            sector, formulation o f the first ever trade facilitation action plan, finalization o f a
            comprehensive financial sector strategy, implementation o f the customs law, improving
            monitoring o f the SOEs, including the state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs), and
            formulating actionable restructuring plans for the four largest SOEs.

            improving social outcomes through better public financial management systems and service
            delivery - supporting ongoing implementation o f the Public Financial Management
            Strengthening Program (PFMSP) and associated capacity building measures; supporting
            centralization o f the Treasury, Customs, and Tax Departments; implementation o f the Treasury
            Single Account (TSA), transforming the government financial information system for timely
            budget reporting and monitoring, mandating binding minimum spending on health and
            education sectors by provinces and introducing a system o f Budget Norms in the 2009/10
            Budget, completion o f the audit peer review o f the State Audit Organization (SAO) and
            development o f a focused capacity building plan, and formulating a costed and prioritized
            budget plan for the Education Sector Development Framework.

8.     I n accordance with standard practice for PRSOs, progress in implementing this PRSO i s
monitored through a Program Matrix, updated annually as part o f PRSO preparations. The

Program Matrix for PRSO-5 (Annex 2) records the 7 prior actions and 25 policy actions completed by the
Government within PRSO-5. Progress with implementation o f the policy framework for PRSO-5 has been
appropriate and the momentum o f reform has been sustained during the current global financial crisis. The
status o f each prior action i s presented in Table 5 on Page 4 1. The Government has achieved all seven
PRSO-5 prior actions.

9.      The PRSO-5 i s underpinned by a strong program o f analytical and advisory activities
(AAA), both completed and ongoing, and reinforced by the satisfactory implementation o f the N T 2
projecta3The design o f the PRSO program was based on several key pieces o f analytical work done by the
World Bank and other donor^.^ These reports are summarized in Section I V on Analytical Underpinnings.

 10.    The PRSO-5 continues to pay careful attention to the criticality principle for budget support
operations and capacity constraints in Government in the design o f the operation. It incorporates
lessons learned from the previous series (Section I V on Lessons Learned), especially with respect to
addressing risks related to capacity constraints. In addition, as programmatic budget support, the operation
seeks to increase funding predictability and the associated dialogue between the Government and donors,
sharper policy prioritization and strengthened donor coordination. The operation also takes into account
the good practice lessons learned on application o f conditionality (see B o x 4).

 11.     The proposed operation i s processed under the I D A Financial Crisis Response Fast-Track
Facility. The impact o f the financial crisis has been a significant widening o f the budget deficit because o f
a fall in revenues and expenditure pressures (See Section 11). In order to assist the government in bridging
this budgetary gap, the PRSO-5 financing volume i s being raised to US$20 million.

1.       COUNTRY CONTEXT

BACKGROUND

 12.       The Lao PDR i s among the world's poorest countries, according to the Bank's Atlas estimates.
It i s a land-locked nation o f 236,000 square km with a population o f around 6.0 million (2008). With an
estimated per capita income o f US$740 in 2008, Lao PDR i s one o f the poorest countries in East Asia and
i s classified by the UN as a Least Developed Country (LDC). Based on the World Bank's new
international poverty line o f $1.25 a day in 2005 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) terms, poverty incidence
was 44 percent in 2002/03. The country has significant natural resources including forestry, minerals and
terrain suited to hydro-electric power with enormous trade potential.

 13.    Agriculture remains a mainstay o f the economy, albeit with declining importance. I t
contributes around 33 percent o f GDP (2008) and employs nearly 70 percent o f the labor force; the
industry sector accounts for a little over 29 percent o f GDP, and services for nearly 39 percent. In terms o f
value at 2008 prices, Lao PDR exports mostly minerals; other large exports are electricity, garments,
agricultural goods, and wood and wood products. Most o f the country's exports are destined for Thailand,
Vietnam, China and Europe, as well as Australia and Taiwan. Imports consist mostly o f industrial and
capital goods, petroleum, food and other consumer products, coming for the most part from Thailand,
followed by Vietnam, India, Japan, China, and South Korea. The economy has also been experiencing a
surge in project investment imports and FDI, following the successful launch o f the N T 2 project.

         Implementationo f the NT2 project i s assessed in six-monthly performance reviews to the Board.

         These include the Investment Climate Assessment (ICA), the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS), the Public
Expenditure Review & IntegratedFiduciary Assessment (PERIFA), the Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS), the Financial
Sector Assessment, periodic Lao Economic Monitors, as well as ongoing work, such as the Country Economic Memorandum on
Natural Resource Management, the Pay and Compensation Review, and the Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA).

14.       Lao PDR has made good progress in the transition from a planned to a market economy,
initially with the introduction o f the New Economic Mechanism (NEM) in 1986. The NEM removed price
controls, abandoned socialist cooperative farming as farmers were allowed to work on their plots and
asserted ownership; the multiple exchange rate system was unified, government's monopoly on trade
removed, the number o f state-owned enterprises reduced, and the establishment o f private f i r m s allowed.
Over the past ten years (1998-2007), real GDP grew at an annual average rate o f 6.4 percent - despite the
sharp fall-off in growth during the regional crisis o f 1997-1999. Reforms stalled during the Asian regional
crisis, as Lao PDR struggled to reestablish macroeconomic stability.

15.     A significant decline in poverty has been achieved during the last decade. Relative to Lao
PDR's national poverty line (based on minimum calorie intake), the incidence o f poverty has fallen to
around 33.5 percent in 2002/03 from 46 percent in 1992/93; or from 49 percent in 1997/98 to 44 percent in
2002/03 based on the World Bank's new international poverty line o f $1.25 a day in 2005 PPP terms.
Social indicators have been improving as well, however, they s t i l l remain among the worst in the region,
and the quality o f measurement remains low.


RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL
CRISIS

16.       The impact o f the global financial crisis on Lao PDR are all due to second round effects
transmitted through the real economy. The financial sector i s not integrated with global banking
institutions, and i s not exposed to foreign borrowing and lending. The slowdown in economic growth i s
therefore due to the impact o f the global financial crisis on demand for Laos exports and foreign
direct investment. The brunt o f the impact o f the crisis i s expected in 2009 and has already emerged
early in the year, with the mining sector, tourism and garments affected. The latter are important for
employment and household incomes.

17.      Real GDP growth in 2008 i s estimated to have decelerated to 7 percent, from 7.5 percent in
2007 ( Figure 1). The resource sectors (most ly new hydro and mining projects) contributed a round
2.0 percentage points to this growth in 2008 (Figure l),   including the construction o f four hydro-power
dams and an extension o f a large copper plant. The remaining 5 percentage points came from non-
resource sectors -- investments in plantations for agricultural crops and industrial forestry, light
manufacturing (including garments), steadily rising tourism revenues, growing retail and construction, and
newly emerging food and nonfood processing industries. Despite declining commodity prices in the
second half o f 2008, export growth was robust, recording an increase o f 21 percent in nominal terms. This
compares well to the preceding five years when exports increased at an annual average rate o f 29 percent.
For 2009, however, export performance i s expected to falter due to both a decline in demand and lower
commodity prices. This, together with a reduction in foreign direct investment inflows i s expected to
result in sharply lower growth for 2009.

18.     Inflation increased to 7.6 percent in 2008, driven by the global food and fuel price increases.
Lao PDR's inflation stayed at or below 10 percent throughout the 2008 food and o i l prices increases.
Average annual inflation (as measured by the Consumer Price Index) was recorded at 4.5 percent in 2007,
a historic low. In 2008, inflation spiked at 10.3 percent in M a y before moderating to 3.2 percent by
December. Food prices nearly doubled early in the year with the food CPI exceeding 10 percent by April.
These levels were sustained until November when food prices slowly began to decline. Since January
2009 the food CPI has continued to decline, albeit at a more rapid pace than earlier (Figure 2).

19.     The collapse in copper prices combined with slowing economic activity led to shortfall in
revenues of approximately 1 percent of GDP in FY2008/09. In addition to lower profit and royalties
from mining companies, the government was faced with lower dividends from state owned enterprises.
Further, declining o i l prices reduced revenues from fuel consumption taxes. The revenue to GDP ratio i s
projected to decline from 14.3 percent o f GDP in 2007/8 to 13 percent in 2008/9. However, overseas
development assistance i s expected to rise from 1.3 percent o f GDP to 2.1 percent in 2008/09,
compensating slightly the reduction in domestic revenue collection.

20.     Expenditure commitments for the South-East Asian Games scheduled for December 2009
coupled with a shortfall in revenues significantly worsened the budget deficit. In order to prepare for

21.      The global financial crisis has affected Lao PDR primarily through a decline in Foreign
Direct Investment. In the last two years, economic growth has been heavily dependent on FDI inflows,
most o'f which has been to the natural resource sector. Disbursements o f foreign investment doubled in
U.S. dollar terms between 2006 and 2008 (to about US$900 million); with 85 percent o f this FDI in the
resource industry. FDI in non-resource sectors, such as agriculture, light manufacturing, processing
industries and services also grew rapidly in recent years but i s s t i l l small in value terms and in comparison
to that in the resource sector<Figure 3).

22.       With exports representing about 30 percent o f GDP, Lao PDR i s relatively less exposed to
the collapse in industrial country demand. Lao PDR has been exporting mostly metals and hydro-
electricity, but also other products, such as garments, wood and wood products, and - most recently -
agricultural produce (Figure 4). The hydropower sector's contribution to exports i s expected to continue
growing in the near future, with N T 2 and other dams coming on stream in and after 2010 but upcoming
projects will remain dependent on sustained and rapid economic recovery in those neighboring countries
which plan to purchase electricity from Lao. Lao PDR has diversified export partners, with a majority o f
exports going to countries in the region (Thailand, China, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Australia). The garment
industry, which experienced rapid growth in 2008, exports mostly to Europe (about US$230 million in
2008) and more recently to the United States (around U S $ 3 0 million in 2008). Recent Developments in the
Lao PDR Garment Sector are summarized in B o x 1.

      Box 1: Recent Developments in the Lao Garment Sector
                                            n
   Industry leaders anticipated a drop i demand following the expiration o f the Agreement on Textiles and
   Clothing, but through early 2009 garment producers in Laos were s t i l l reporting strong fulfillment o f orders
   until the end o f 2009. The value o f exports in 2008 was estimated at US$260 million - a more than 50 percent
   increase in nominal terms from 2007. Through early 2009, there has been no retrenchment o f employees in
   this sector. Despite these positive developments early in the year, from April 2009, the garment industry
   association i s expecting a decline o f 20-30 percent in exports due to declining external demand.

   The slow impact o f the global crisis on Lao garment exports could be partly explained by the fact that Lao
   mainly supplies low-end products and i t s market share in the global clothing market i s so small. For example,
   while the EU market accounts for about 90 percent o f total Lao exports, the penetration o f the Lao garment
   exports into the E U market only accounted for 0.1 percent o f market share in 2006. In addition, the following
   factors have contributed: (1) Demand for imported clothing in Europe appears less affected by the crisis as
   evidenced by the fact that EU clothing imports did not show a decline, as o f January this year. In contrast, U.S.
   imports f e l l sharply in the first two months o f the year, being negatively affected by the economic recession. A t
   the same time shipments from China to the U.S. surged while other suppliers were confronted with a dramatic
   decline in U.S. orders because o f the elimination o f U.S. limits on imports from China; (2) Strong market
   position o f Lao garment products in Europe. Over the past few years, Lao has successfully retained i t s market
   share o f 0.1 percent despite strong growth o f exports from China; and fmally (3) Lao garment producers have
   also indirectly benefited from strong performance o f Thai clothing exports in Europe because o f i t s close
   integration with the Thai textile industry, (a significant number o f Lao producers are operating as
   subcontractors for Thai exporters). W h i l e US. imports o f clothing products from Thailand drastically declined
   last year, Thai exports o f garment to Europe rose by 1 1 percent in 2008.

   As part o f the overall crisis package, GOL has recently harmonized profit tax rates in the garment industry.
   This w i l l amount to a reduction o f tax rates from 35 to 20 percent for all f i r m s .

   Clothing exports began declining from a number o f emerging market countries in the first two months o f the
   year. Shipments fell 12 percent from Vietnam, 27 percent from Turkey and even 41 percent from Brazil (if
   including textiles). Clothing exports however rose nearly 6 percent in January from China and 5 percent from
   India. Textile bailout programs are being prepared or already implemented in a large number o f countries.
   China may fully exempt exporters from the V A T while Vietnam may even offer export subsidies.



23.     The current account recorded a deficit equivalent to 16.5 percent o f GDP in 2008. The
current account deficit was mostly the result o f imports for the construction o f large resource sector
projects and also high prices o n imported fuel, though there were some compensating effects from high
copper prices which boosted export receipts. On the capital account side, there was a surplus equivalent to
18.6 percent o f GDP, driven by FDI inflows for the large projects. Hence, overall there was an increase in
reserves o f 2.1 percent o f GDP. Indications for early 2009 are o f a reduction in the current account deficit
compared t o 2008, due t o lower imports, coupled with lower capital inflows.

24.     Before the crisis, BOL allowed the kip to appreciate in order to manage pressures arising
from exports o f natural resources and commodity price increases. Between January and December
2008, the kip appreciated by about 9.7 percent against the U.S. dollar. Reserves continued to accumulate,
to US$636 million by end-2008 (compared to $530 million at end-2007) and reached nearly 6 months o f
non-resource imports in 2008.

25.     There has been a fall in reserves in the first few months o f 2009 as the Bank o f Lao PDR has
intervened in the foreign exchange market to ward off depreciation pressures on the kip (Figure 6).
Since end-2008 there has been pressure on the kip to depreciate. However the Bank o f Lao PDR has been
intervening to keep the kip from depreciating. This has resulted in a gradual reduction in international
reserves since the beginning o f 2009. In June 2009 international reserves increased slightly as min'ing
companies remitted taxes to the government in U S dollars. Figure 6 shows the evolution o f international
reserves from December 2007 to June 2009.

26.     Credit grew by 84 percent in 2008, including accelerated lending to SOEs, raising concern
about increasing contingent liabilities due to poor capacity o f SOCBs to screen borrowers. The economy
has been historically starved for credit against a background o f high liquidity in the banking system, and
therefore a time-bound growth in credit was warranted in 2008. The SOCBs increased their loan portfolios
during this period by approximately 53 percent (in kip nominal terms). The private and joint-stock banks

increased their loan portfolios by approximately 109 percent, however f r o m a near zero base. Total lending
as percent o f GDP increased from 9 percent in 2007 to 11.8 percent in 2008, while lending t o SOEs
increased from 1.2 t o 2.5 percent o f GDP (Table 1).

Box 2: Actions in the Banking Sector under PRSO 1-4

During PRSO 1-4, the BOL and SOCBs conducted a number of reforms to improve oversight and monitoring
of the SOCBs by BOL, to reduce the stock and flow of NPLs, and to increase MOF's ownership o f its
financial SOEs. Total NPLs were reduced from 21.2 percent in 2006 to 3.06 percent in June 2008, mainly through
write-offs. Governance Agreements were introduced for BCEL and LDB, containing four groups o f financial and
operational criteria, including (1) financial component, (2) credit policy component, (3) operational policies
component and (4) reporting and exceptions disclosure components, upon completion o f which the recapitalization
tranches were disbursed. The banks have been regularly audited by international accounting fi rms , and MOF
recapitalized them to balance their balance sheets (in 2006 and 2007, BCEL received total capital o f kip 227 billion
($26.7 million), and LDB received kip 123 billion ($14.5 million), in the form o f bonds). Efforts were made,
supported by ADB and IFC, to improve the ability o f the SOCBs to screen borrowers. The third large APB bank
was split in two to better account for and to distinguish between policy interventions and commercial transactions.
In 2008, performance o f APB was successful and met the performance target for the year 2008, so that MOF
recapitalized the APB in the amount o f kip 87.50 billion ($10.3 million).

27.      The new momentum in donor support for policy reform implementation continues. Budget
support i s o n the rise, with EC, Australia, and Japan j o i n i n g t o co-finance the PRSO. The establishment o f
two multi-donor trust funds (MDTFs) in public financial management and trade development contributes
further t o the existing technical assistance support and donor harmonization. The Government i s also
seeking greater donor coordination and harmonization o f foreign assistance through more organized j o i n t
Government-donor working groups, in support o f policy reform as w e l l as investments in health,
education, infrastructure and agriculture. Some concerns arise, however, as some development partners
m a y decrease their aid t o LICs in the face o f the global financial crisis.

           The budget classification of the Government differs from that based on the GFS because o f inclusion o f debt payments
above the line, instead o f below the line (into financing). In addition, Government's projections o f the revenues are slightly more
optimistic than those of WB and the IMF. As a result, the targets committed to by the Government in Annex 1 and presented in the
Government's classification, correspond to different deficit in the fiscal framework that i s done according to the GFS
classification. The deficit in FY208109 and FY2009/10, including measures, in this table correspond to the Annex 1 targets in the
Government's classification.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK

28.       GDP growth i s expected to slow to around 5 percent in 2009, increasing to 6.5 percent in
2010. Economic growth will continue to be driven by increases in agricultural output (by 2.6 percent),
volume o f copper production from 90,000 in 2008 to about 120,000 ton in 2009, and by the services sector.
O f the overall 5 percent growth forecast for 2009, agriculture i s expected to contribute 0.8 percentage
points, mining 1.5 percentage points, hydropower 0.4 percentage points, and services 1.9 percentage points
(wage bill 1.4 percentage points and credit growth 0.2 percentage points), see Figure . The Rapid
Enterprise Survey conducted recently to monitor the impacts o f the crisis confirms these projections (see
B o x 3). The coming on stream o f N T 2 in early 2010 i s expected to contribute to an increase in GDP to
6.5 percent (Table 2 and Figure ).

29.     I n the medium-term, the growth is projected to stay at about 6.5 on average for 2009-2013
and will be driven by the resource sector (hydropower and mining), agriculture, and services; the
contribution from manufacturing and construction i s also expected to increase. The medium-term growth
rate could however be affected due to the possible postponement in large project start-ups, deferred
expansion in the mining sector, as well as sluggish growth in non-resource industry due to reduced
external demand, lower tourism receipts, and changes in demand from neighboring countries (especially
Thailand, China and Vietnam) and the EU.

sector, a Rapid Enterprise Survey was conducted during April 20-24, 2009. In total 140 f i r m s located in four urban
districts o f Vientiane Capital were interviewed, including 53 f i r m s from retail and whole sale trade, 40 from general
manufacturing and 33 and 14 f m s from hotels/guesthousesand travel agents.
44 percent o f f m s reported higher revenue for the first quarter o f 2009, compared to that in the first three months o f
2008. Only 32 percent o f f m s experienced a decline in their revenue for the first three months o f 2009 (see Q1
performance by sector i Box Figure below). W h i l e about 62 percent o f f m s responded that their business may be
                        n
affected by the global economic crisis, this response was not f i l l y supported by the more detailed financial and
employment information received from the same firms.

In terms o f impact on employment, the survey shows that only 14 percent o f all respondents reduced number o f their
staff during the first quarter o f 2009, 3 percent reduced number o f working hours and 1 and 3 percent o f f m s '
surveyed reduced average wage and number o f work-shifts, respectively. The majority o f f i r m s interviewed during
the survey were positive about the f i t u r e o f their businesses. About 44 percent o f f m s are s t i l l projecting higher
revenues for 2009 compared to 2008 and about 40 percent are still planning to increase their investment during
2009.
The interviews with industry leaders also c o n f m that domestic consumption remains strong as evidenced by more
than 10 percent increase in number o f vehicles and about 90 percent growth o f number o f construction permits
issued in Vientiane capital during the first three months o f 2009. The key fmdings o f the Rapid Survey are also
consistent with the results o f Retail Confidence Survey conducted by Indochina Research (an independent regional
think tank) according to which, most retailers in Indochina Region have been hard hit by the crisis with the
exception o f Laos, where retailer conditions have actually improved.

31.         I t i s projected that FDI will decline by nearly 25 percent in 2009, through deferred
hydropower projects and new investments in the mining sector, as well as sluggish growth in the
non-resource industries. The large FDI projects in the pipeline and expansions o f existing projects
(which drove sector growth in the last two years) will be affected by the global economic slowdown, the
f a l l in commodity prices, and credit constraints, thereby causing a fall in FDI.

32.       The medium terms balance o f payments outlook i s favorable. The current account i s expected
to remain in deficit due t o high level o f imports o f capital goods in the minerals sector. However, this
deficit i s expected to be self correcting, since it depends on matching capital inflows, consistent with the
projected increase in international reserves over the medium term (see Table 2).

33.     After increasing by 84 percent in 2008, credit growth i s expected to slow down significantly
in 2009, following the Government's commitment to maintain macroeconomic stability, as reflected
in Annex 1. The relative increase in lending to SOEs in 2008 (see Table 1) and in directed lending by the
BOL (quasi-fiscal operations) raises concerns about possible future contingent liabilities, and a possible
deterioration o f the balance sheets o f the B O L and the SOCBs, through a potential increase in NPLs. These
risks are highlighted by a history o f a lack o f appropriate capacity for screening o f borrowers and high
concentration o f credit.

34.      The budget deficit (including the fiscal measures outlined in Annex 1) i s expected to increase
to 6.7 percent o f GDP in FY2008/09 and i s projected at 4.4 percent in FY2009/10. The fiscal
framework in Table 2 summarizes the projected fiscal deficit with and without the measures outlined in the
next section and Annex 1. Without measures, the deficit would increase to 7.6 percent o f GDP in
FY2008/09 and to 5.6 percent o f GDP in FY2009/10. The increase in deficit i s due to the revenue shortfall
due to the crisis, as well as to an increase in off-budget activities conducted recently by the BOL. The
revenue short-fall i s projected to come from: (i)     profit tax and royalties from mining companies;
(ii)dividends from SOEs and commercial banks; (iii)        reductions in profit tax collection due to the
slowdown in economic activities; and (iv) reductions in petroleum tax collections. The proposed measures
are discussed in the next section.

    GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE, FINANCING NEEDS, AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

    35.      Expansionary measures were taken in response to the crisis, but the Government has
    committed to maintain stability by phasing out quasi-fiscal activities, containing credit growth, and
    introducing additional fiscal measures to contain the fiscal deficit (see Annex 1). The Government has
    issued a response plan to the financial crisis and i s planning to discuss additional measures during the
    upcoming National Assembly session. The plan consists o f 80 actions, among which are: (i)           adjusting
    revenue and growth projections for the FY2009/10 budget; (ii)       some concessions to the main export
    sectors, such as tax cuts for the garment industry and postponement o f tax payments for the mining
    industry; and (iii)  seeking additional financial support from development partners. Credit growth and
    quasi-fiscal activities have served as a stimulus contributing to an increase in domestic demand, thus
    mitigating the potential crisis impacts; however it i s important that they are phased out, to avoid
    overheating. The National Assembly will discuss the results o f these activities during i t s upcoming session
    in late June 2009, and has already publicly indicated concerns that these measures may not be consistent
    with macroeconomic stability.

    36.      Based on the revenue and expenditures projections that include the impact o f the global
    crisis, as well as taking into account additional measures and fiscal targets proposed in Annex 1, the
                                                                -
    budget deficit i s expected to remain high in FY2008 2010. The measures aimed at reducing the
    projected total deficit from nearly 8 percent o f GDP to 6.8 in FY2008/09 and from 5.6 to 4.4 percent in
    FY2009/10 (see Table 2) will include: (1) revenue measures, in the amount o f 0.4 percent o f GDP,
    including the imposition o f additional alcohol, cigarette, and fuel excises, as well as the restructuring o f
    taxes and fees on luxury goods; (2) expenditure measures, in the amount o f 0.5 percent o f GDP, including
    short-term savings from delayed procurement o f supplies and office equipment; deferred hiring o f new
    staff; reduced fuel allowances resulting from fuel price drop; compressing other current expenditures such
    as travel and operational costs; and rationalizing domestically financed capital expenditure, as needed. On
    the financing side, additional pledge o f donor financing (including the additional $10m for the PRSOS)
    will contribute 0.5 percent o f GDP.

    37.      A considerable increase in domestic financing will be needed to cover this budget deficit
    (Table 2). The quasi-fiscal activities conducted by the B O L contribute a sizeable increase to the total
'
    deficit, and are financed via asset sales (land concession equivalent to around 1.2 percent o f GDP) as well
    as via domestic lending by BOL (including a draw-down o f the Government reserves at the B O L as well as
    borrowing through the issuance o f BOL's own bonds amounting to 0.6 percent o f GDP). The total amount
    o f such financing i s projected at 2.4 percent o f GDP. The remaining 1.4 percent o f GDP in the domestic
    financing needed i s expected to come from savings (government deposits) as well as further domestic
    borrowing from the SOCBs, which are relatively liquid due to l o w loan-to-deposit ratios.

    38.      Additional budget support from development partners i s also needed to finance the budget
    deficit. Lao PDR i s an ODA-dependent country that benefits mostly from project-related foreign
    assistance in the form o f concessional loans and relatively modest budget support. Apart from IDA'S
    PRSO series (co-financed by EC, Australia and -- in the past -- Japan), ADB, Japan and Australia provide
    other budget support while some other donors are contemplating co-financing with the PRSO. I t i s
    expected that the European Commission and Australia will continue to provide additional yearly support
    through the PRSO vehicle, bringing the total financing under PRSOs to around US$25-30 million this
    year. I t would be critically important that Japan resumes budget support in the face o f the global crisis
    which i s now affecting the Lao PDR.

    39.      There are a number of risks associated with the economic outlook. Upside risks include a
    shorter than expected global recession, and fast recovery o f key trading partners like Thailand, as well as
    maintained momentum o f the recent recovery in copper prices. Downside risks include (1) another round


                                                         14
o f declines in copper prices, (2) a slower than expected global recovery that would mean more delays in
construction o f the power plants, (3) a reversal o f the currently planned measures to contain the fiscal
deficit, quasi-fiscal activities and credit growth may jeopardize macroeconomic stability, or (4) significant
delays in implementation o f the structural reform agenda.

40.       These risks have been partially addressed through the PRSO program and the measures
proposed by the Government in its Letter o f Development Policy are expected to ensure that the
macro-economic framework remains adequate for the purpose of this proposed operation. PRSO-5
includes actions to: (i)  reduce the accumulation o f arrears to Electricite du Laos (EDL) and binding
mechanisms have been put in place in the FY2008/2009 budget to ensure that arrears are not generated on
other utilities, (ii)improve debt reporting and debt management, and (iii)       enhance the efficiency o f the
public financial management system and strengthen fiduciary controls. The current restructuring o f some
key SOEs under financial distress, led by the Prime Minister's Office, has resulted in a reduction in related
liabilities. The current stock o f arrears on electricity i s being repaid through a combination o f budgetary
outlays and balance sheet operations between MOF and EDL. The financial sector strategy and other
policy actions to improve the supervisory functions o f the BOL if implemented well, will reduce NPLs and
improve oversight. The policy actions aimed at improved debt management and a strong focus on
comprehensive reform o f the public financial management system are central to mitigating macroeconomic
risks.

41.     According to the most recent debt sustainability analysis @SA), Lao PDR continues to face a
high risk o f debt distress.6 External public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt stocks remain elevated,
but the high level o f concessionality o f official borrowing, which comprises most o f Lao's debt, keeps debt
service ratios relatively contained. Public external debt stock indicators are expected to remain at or above
policy-dependant indicative thresholds throughout half o f the projection period under the baseline
scenario, and could increase further in the event o f weaker macroeconomic performance or greater
accumulation o f non-concessional debt. Debt servicing ratios, however, remain below the relevant
thresholds even under alternative assumptions.

42.     The debt profile has improved in recent years, in part because the government has generally
followed a prudent strategy o f avoiding the accumulation o f non-concessional debt. Strong economic
growth, currency appreciation, and prudent debt management contributed to a decline in the debt ratio over
the past few years-the stock o f external PPG debt in nominal terms was US$2.9 billion at end-2008, or
53 percent of GDP, down from 81 percent at end-2005. The corresponding net present value (NPV) o f debt
at end-2008 was 35 percent o f GDP or 91 percent o f exports o f goods and non-factor services. In terms o f
composition, nearly 70 percent o f PPG debt i s held by multilateral creditors, mainly the Asian
Development Bank and IDA. About 29 percent i s held by bilateral creditors, including a large Soviet-era
debt to Russia that i s currently under negotiation. Only 2 percent comprises external debt incurred by
public entities on nonconcessional terms, mainly for hydropower development and electricity generation.
The size o f domestic public debt i s currently small, and comprises mainly treasury bills and bank
recapitalization bonds. At end-2008, the stock o f recorded domestic public debt amounted to 2.1 percent o f
GDP.

43.      Under the baseline scenario, external debt stock indicators remain at elevated levels over the
medium term, but decline below the relevant indicative thresholds toward the middle o f the
projection period. The net present value (NPV) o f public external debt increases slightly over the short-
term as the pipeline o f IDA and ADB move from grants to credits, before declining steadily to 20 percent
o f GDP over the longer term. Debt service ratios (both as a share o f exports and government revenues) fall
continually and remain below indicative thresholds throughout, despite falling concessionality as Lao PDR
i s assumed to assess more commercial borrowing as the country develops.

44.      External debt sustainability i s most vulnerable to a depreciation o f the nominal exchange
rate.' In the same way that the sustained strong appreciation o f the kip over the past couple o f years served
to bring the debt ratio down considerably, a 30 percent depreciation kip would lead to a sharp jump in the
NPV of debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue ratios which would remain above the respective debt stock
thresholds through most or all o f the projection period. Under this shock, debt levels (both related to GDP
and revenue) would only decline below the thresholds over the very long term. Lower export growth (by
one standard deviation in 2010-1 1) would push the NPV o f debt-to-exports up to double i t s baseline level
over the first half o f the projection period and in excess o f indicative thresholds throughout.

45.      External borrowing should be obtained on concessional terms and fiscal and quasi-fiscal
liabilities should be carefully managed, to guard against external vulnerabilities and to ensure debt
ratios remain on a declining path. Continued prudent debt management as well as cautious assessment
and monitoring o f large-scale projects will be required to mitigate the risks posed to external and public
debt sustainability. Given the number o f potentially profitable projects in the resource sector, availability
o f non-concessional finance i s likely to increase once the financial crisis subsides, and fiscal risks could
arise if these projects fail to generate the expected returns, including to the government's own equity
stakes. This highlights the importance o f improving debt management capacity and developing a medium-
term borrowing strategy for the government, including for resource sector activity, as well as greater
disclosure o f borrowing plans.

46.      Lao PDR chose not to avail itself of debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country
(HIPC) Initiative o r the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Because Lao PDR i s classified as
having a high risk o f debt distress, under the debt sustainability framework Lao PDR receives a l l IDA
assistance on grant terms (PRSO 2-4, and the proposed PRSO-5 are IDA grants). Lao PDR i s also eligible
for up to 50 percent o f grants within i t s performance based allocation from the ADB.

PROGRESS W I T H POVERTY REDUCTION

47.      Lao PDR has achieved significant progress in poverty reduction, however the global
financial crisis will affect this performance. The poverty headcount * has declined from almost half the
population to one third within a decade. In 1992/93, basic needs were not met for 46 percent o f people,
but this number f e l l to 39 percent in 1997/78 and to 33 percent by 2002/03. The share o f poverty was
reduced by 30 percent in one decade, lifting one eighth o f the total population out o f poverty. Even though
the population grew by one million between 1992/93 and 2002/03, the absolute number o f the poor
declined to less than 2 million. Preliminary results from the fourth round o f the Lao Expenditure and
Consumption Survey indicate that poverty has continued to decline (to approximately 27 per cent in
2007/08). However, there are significant disparities across regions and provinces, both in the level o f
poverty and rate o f change relative to 2002/03. As the impact o f the global financial crisis i s felt on the
real sector the poverty situation may be exacerbated by: (i)  increase in unemployment and fall in incomes;
(ii)reduction in remittances from Lao workers in neighboring countries; (iii)   reverse migration from urban
to rural areas.

48.      The incidence o f poverty has strong geographic features and therefore the geographical
focus of the NSEDP's poverty reduction effort i s appropriate. Poverty i s lower in cities than in
villages; in areas with roads than those without; along the Thai border than along the Vietnamese border;
and in the lowlands than in the uplands. The priority districts are on average much poorer than non-
priority districts. Indeed, the Lao Poverty Assessment shows that the largest decline in poverty happened
in the priority districts, which are a focus o f the intervention by the Government and development partners.
However, it should be noted that, due to the small population share in the priority districts, the majority o f
the poor live in areas with higher population density, including in urban centers and the provinces along
the Mekong. These are also the areas that will most likely experience the direct impact o f the global
financial crisis.

        The poverty headcount shows the share o f the poor in total population, or the share o f population whose per capita
consumption i s below the national poverty line (a complex estimate approximately equivalent to US$1.50 per day).



                                                                  17
49.     Liberalization o f private sector, trade and expansion o f the road network (financed by the
public sector) were major drivers o f poverty reduction during the period o f 1997/98-2002/03? Other
major entry points for poverty reduction include road access to market, farming productivity, lack of
ownership o f land and livestock, limited access to credit and weak marketing chains. In addition to the
geographical factors, major causes o f poverty include the legacy o f physical devastation during the
Vietnam War, with unexploded ordnance (UXO) s t i l l affecting half o f the country's territory; weak public
service delivery, especially in the health and education sectors; inadequate communications infrastructure;
and shortcomings and weaknesses in the management o f public resources.

TOWARDS ACHIEVING MDGs

50.     Lao PDR faces multiple challenges in meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
by 2015, which are expected to be further challenged by the global financial crisis. The second
national report on the implementation o f the MDGs in the Lao PDR has been prepared by the Government
and UNDP. The MDG report sets the goals to be met by 2015, in accordance with the national priorities
and through the implementation o f the NGPES (Figure 4). Lao PDR lags behind the regional and low-
income country's averages on many key social indicators (Table 2). Overall, the Lao PDR's mixed record
on social indicators reflects a difficult transition process in the 1990s, a l o w tax collection effort at less
than 11-12 percent o f GDP until the last 2 years and significant decentralization with lack o f adequate
central oversight. Available data suggest that the Lao PDR i s o f f track on a number o f the MDGs,
including malnutrition, measles immunization, skilled birth attendance, and some dimensions o f gender
equality (girl's equal enrollment in tertiary education).

51.      Education i s among the better performing sectors in Laos, at about the halfway point
between the 1990 benchmark and the 2015 target date. The literacy rate for young adults (15 to
24 year-olds) i s roughly on target (showing progress from the 71 percent in 1995 to 84 percent in 2005).
Although this represents good progress, literacy rates are well below regional averages: an adult literacy
rate at 84 percent continues to represent a considerable distance with the regional average at 98 percent.
Enrolment rates data also show a steady progress, from 58 percent in 1991 to 84 percent in 2005, but s t i l l
behind Cambodia and Thailand. Finally, the primary school completion rate shows an increase from
48 percent in 2001 to 60 percent in 2004, but s t i l l making the MDG target o f 90 percent look beyond
reach, and below regional averages.

52.     Progress towards the health MDGs has been mixed. The under-5 mortality rate has declined
from 170 to 98 between 1995 and 2005. While child mortality i s s t i l l high, the MDG target i s within
reach. There has been less progress on other health indicators, in particular malnutrition, skilled birth
attendance, and immunization coverage. The need for progress in these areas represents a considerable
challenge for the coming years.

11               THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

53.      The Government's medium-term strategy i s to achieve rapid economic growth with the goal
o f graduating from the status o f least-developed country (LDC) by 2020. This strategy has been
articulated consistently in several national strategy documents, including the NGPES, 2004, and i t s
successor, the NSEDP, 2006-10. The Government i s cognizant that the global financial crisis will provide
a significant challenge to achieving the objective o f graduating from L D C status, and as a response the
Government i s redoubling i t s efforts to push through reforms aimed at improving public financial
management framework as well as strengthening the monitoring o f SOCBs.

54.      The NGPES and NSEDP were developed through an increasingly participatory process,
established a framework for future reforms and made Government development priorities more
explicit and transparent. These priorities are consistent with the multi-dimensional nature o f poverty
alleviation and seek, in particular, to: (i) deepen structural reforms in areas including public expenditure
management, financial sector, SOEs, private sector development, trade and legal development;
(ii)maintain macroeconomic stability by increasing revenue and ensuring appropriate monetary and fiscal
policy; (iii)invest in the social sectors to expand access and improve social sector outcomes; (iv) invest in
infrastructure such as roads, power and water supply, and expand access to these services; (v) invest in
rural development and natural resource management - including support for agricultural, mining, forestry



                                                                               20
and hydropower development; and (vi) strengthen national capacity and institutions. The Poverty
Reduction Strategy underpins both the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and the PRSO program.

55.     The sixth NSEDP 2006-10 and the Progress Report are viewed as a Poverty Reduction
Strategy that fulfills the main criteria: poverty focus, broad participation, results ,orientation, and
donor harmonization. The NSEDP 2006-10 integrates the NGPES and builds on i t s participatory
approach, poverty focus and to some extent results orientation. I t complies with the key features o f a
successful Poverty Reduction Strategy. In particular, it went through a transparent and accountable
drafting process, and contained a small but functional monitoring and evaluation framework. I t also
addresses donor harmonization issues. International non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and donors
active in the Lao PDR endorsed the final NSEDP at the 9th Round Table Meeting (RTM) on November
28", 2006, and reconfirmed their commitment at the two subsequent Round Table Implementation
Meetings in November 2007 and 2008.

56.       The NSEDP envisages the reduction o f poverty through a combination o f broad-based
economic growth and focused and policy interventions. The four strategic intervention areas o f the plan
are i)human development and private sector driven economic growth; ii)competitiveness, trade and
regional integration; iii)social development and targeted poverty reduction interventions; and iv) good
governance. Through these key priority intervention areas, the NSEDP enables the evolution o f the Lao
PDR's economy towards a private sector led system with modern governance, while keeping a strong
focus on human and social development. The geographical targeting o f NSEDP's interventions reflects
the empirical evidence provided by the most recent household survey and the Lao PDR Poverty
Assessment. The PRSO considers focused interventions on the first two pillars under Component 1 and
the last two pillars under Component 2 o f the Policy Action Matrix.

57.      The Government has established a mechanism for monitoring the impact o f the global
economic crisis and considering how this program focus needs to change due to the global financial
crisis. The Prime Minister has established a cross-sector task force comprising o f economic, social, and
infrastructure ministries to monitor the impact o f the global financial crisis on a monthly basis and
consider measures to mitigate i t s impact, including how the overall reform program focus areas could be
re-prioritized in this regard.

REVIEW OF KEY POLICY REFORMS UNDER THE FIRST FOUR PRSOs

58.      The economy has been buoyant, with growth averaging around 7 percent o f GDP during the
past decade, supported by prudent macroeconomic management and ongoing progress in fiscal and
structural reforms. Macroeconomic stability has been maintained through compatible monetary-fiscal
controls and strict cash management on the. budget side; at the same time revenue policies were put in
place to reduce fiscal risks. These efforts have resulted in a successful reduction o f the budget deficit and
meeting o f revenue targets in the last three fiscal years (FY2005/06-FY2007/08).              Without these
continuing structural reforms, it would be difficult for the Government to maintain macroeconomic
stability.

59.     Substantial progress i s being made in the overall public financial management reform
program. Within the Government's Public Finance Management Strengthening Program (PFMSP), the
PRSOs 1-4 concentrated on assisting the Government in putting in place an appropriate legislative
framework for managing budgetary resources and starting implementation o f the Budget L a w o f 2007
which focus on centralization o f the Treasury Department, Customs Department, and the Tax Department,
along with development o f a new revenue sharing framework. Some o f the key P F M reforms implemented
to-date by the government are: (i)    establishing centralized control over all provincial and ministerial
spending accounts, representing about 80 percent of total budgetary resources; (ii)   revising the budget


                                                     21
classification system to be consistent the I M F GFS statistics, and implementing it for FY2008/09 budget
(iii)published, with expanding coverage and improved timeliness, the annual budget and outturn reports;
(iv) mandated minimum spending on health and education sectors by provincial governments starting
FY2008/09; and (v) improved the legislative framework governing public financial management and
external audit. The PRSO program has been instrumental in supporting the government's policy reform
framework in these areas.

60.      Notwithstanding the progress achieved, some areas within the PFM reforms have
experienced delays due to technical capacity constraints, difficult institutional change management,
and the political context. The development o f the new intergovernmental fiscal transfer mechanism has
been slower than anticipated because o f technical capacity constraints at MOF to devise the transfer
mechanism, significant institutional changes needed in establishing a transparent and rules based central-
local resource allocation framework to replace the established ad-hoc bargaining process, and political
support needed to transfer resource allocation powers from provinces to the center. However, the
Government has been moving in the right direction, with significant consultations with provinces and the
political establishment, and in this regard has managed to mandate minimum spending by provinces on
social sectors, agreeing to sharing rates for shared taxes, as well as MOF developing a phased strategy for
implementing the budget norms. The PRSO continues to support this difficult but high value reform
program progressively over the current series. Another area where limited progress has been achieved i s
on developing sectoral medium term expenditure frameworks. This i s again due to a lack o f
implementation capacity and coordination between sectors and MOF. However, the ADB continues to
lead efforts on developing the MTEFs over time.

61.      Revenue effort has been increasing but the global financial crisis will pose a challenge to
maintaining this improvements. The Government has succeeded in improving revenue forecasting and
collections, as demonstrated by the achievement o f i t s revenue target for the past three years. lo The
revenue to GDP ratio increased from 12.6 percent in 2005/06 to 14.2 by 2007/08. This increase in revenue
effort i s a combination o f public financial management reforms as well as high commodity prices.
However the global financial crisis will cause significant revenue shortfall in FY2008/09 mostly from the
resource sector. Improvements in revenue collection and enhanced expenditure controls have allowed the
Government to fully fund budget expenditures and to start settling arrears on utilities, and these controls
will be an important tool for managing expenditures appropriately as the financial crisis unfolds further.
The Government has also started presenting budget reports and consolidated financial statements to the
Parliament's June session. By bringing forward the time for budget submission to the National Assembly
from October to June, there i s now more time for deliberations on the overall budget strategy and for
sector ministries and provinces to prepare detailed budgets proposals and allocate them to spending units
earlier in the budget year, thereby improving budget planning and execution.

62.      The PFMSP has gained momentum and i s being implemented, albeit with some delays. The
PFMSP interventions and the new provisions on centralization in the Budget Law together constitute a
very robust and internally consistent plan for improving public finance management in Lao PDR. Ongoing
efforts in the context o f the PFMSP aim to improve public financial management in time for the coming on
stream o f the NT2 revenues in 20 10. Progress i s being made with identifying eligible expenditures against
NT2 resources, albeit delays have been recently experienced in this regard due to personnel changes at the
MOF. However, the management o f the MOF has given assurance that programs will be identified by June
2009, as agreed earlier. Progress with putting in place the core systems to manage NT2 revenues has been
on-track. Government has made efforts to improve the monitoring and evaluation framework through the
Public Expenditure Review (PER) and Public Expenditures Tracking Survey (PETS), and international

10
          The Lao PDR Public Expenditure Review and Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (2007) highlighted shortfalls in revenue
collection a central issue and the main reason for cash rationing and arrear accumulation.



                                                            22
advisory services have been engaged to assist the Government improve the results framework for PFMSP
and conduct the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment from April 2009.

63.      Several steps were taken in the PRSP priority sectors (health, education, and infrastructure).
During PRSOs 1-4, the Government improved monitoring and timeliness o f payment o f salaries to
teachers and health workers. In addition, it launched pilots o f school grants program and equity funds
pilots for hospitals. In infrastructure, it increased financing o f the road maintenance fund to near financial
sustainability through fuel levy increases; and updated road preservation fund.

64.      The Government has achieved progress in bringing state-owned utilities towards cost
recovery levels, especially Electricity du Laos (EDL) and it will be important to ensure that this
achievement i s not affected by the global financial crisis. Regular and on-schedule electricity and water
tariff increases took place during PRSOs 1-4, moving state-owned utilities to cost recovery levels. The
Government i s following the Power Sector Action Plan to ensure financial viability o f EDL, an SOE.
Financial viability o f the power sector has four key aspects: (i)
                                                                 settle electricity arrears o f Government for
the year ending September 2005; (ii)    implement an arrangement for ensuring that future government bills
for electricity consumption are paid in full, and on time, so that the receivables from government
departments do not exceed 90 days; (iii)  annual tariff adjustment for EDL to achieve financial performance
targets; and (iv) reduction o f technical and commercial losses by EDL. Government has implemented
tariff adjustment measure since 2005, and in 2007 EDL posted a profit for the first time in recent years.
However, the revenue shortfall in FY2008/09 may cause arrear accumulation in utilities, and this needs to
be monitored closely. The Government also established a Rural Electrification Fund, and drafted new
Water Supply Law. It also introduced a forestry sector monitoring system, and Forestry Industry
Restructuring plan.

65.      The Lao financial sector has gradually moved toward commercialization, transparency and
sustainability. The PRSO 1-4 concentrated on the restructuring o f the SOCBs. Independent international
auditors have regularly performed audits based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and
are giving an impartial assessment o f the real banking situation o f SOCBs albeit with qualified audits. The
performance o f two SOCBs, namely B C E L and LDB, has met the operational and financial target set in
the ADB -BOL agreed Governance Agreement (GA) and thus both were eligible to be recapitalized by
M O F in 2006 and 2007 respectively. Within PRSOs 1-4, B O L made progress on drafting several
regulations. The new Accounting L a w supporting the International Accounting Standard (IAS) and the
Regulation on Micro-Finance concerning all deposit-taking and non deposit-taking Micro-Finance
Institutions (MFIs) were enacted in 2007 and 2008 respectively. The Law on Commercial Banks was
prepared for Government's approval in order to create a more leveled playing field in the banking sector.
The BOL, as Central Bank, acting on behalf o f the Government, finalized the first Financial Sector
Strategy (FSS) which aim to develop a strong, efficient, well-recognized and competitive financial system.

66.    These financial sector reforms are helping the Lao PDR financial sector navigate through
the global financial crisis better. Improved monitoring o f SOCBs and external audits have helped to
improve financial management o f these institutions, and these improvements have to some extent mitigate
and manage the impacts o f the global financial crisis to-date.

67.      The Government implemented measures aimed at improving performance and financial
position o f SOEs. The PRSOs 1-4 supported restructuring o f SOEs that account for about 85 percent o f
total revenues o f the whole state owned sector. Within the PRSOs 1-4 timeframe, international audits were
undertaken by GOL for the largest loss-making SOEs and for SOCBs, restructuring plans for the four
largest loss-making SOEs were also developed and started implementation, and the Government i s now
developing restructuring plans for additional four SOEs. The Government has also established regular




                                                     23
monitoring o f the progress against the restructuring plans o f SOEs and against financial targets established
for the SOCBs.

68.     Progress has been slower on implementation of restructuring plans for SOEs. The
implementation o f restructuring plans has been slower than anticipated, due to the business process re-
engineering required to address issues o f performance and financial management. However, with support
from Japan and the World Bank, the Government has continued to implement the restructuring plans that
are consistent with the implementation possibility frontier in Lao PDR.

69.      The shift in the approach to the private sector has taken place during PRSOs 1-4 that marks
an important step in transition from a planned to a market economy. The Enterprise Law, approved
in late 2005, i s based on international best practice, and relevant implementing regulations are gradually
developed and new simplified business registration system was introduced in August 2008. At the Round
Table Meeting in November 2006, the Government presented a comprehensive strategy for private sector
development and trade that focuses on improving the investment climate including reduction in
cumbersome regulations and procedures at and behind the border. The Government hosted four Lao
Business Forums for private-public dialogue and has made tangible progress in resolving key regulatory
issues raised by the private sector. The Government has also committed to an S M E strategy encompassing
reform measures in many investment climate components, such as regulatory environment for businesses,
access to finance, enterprise taxation, and accounting. In the financial sector, several laws and regulations
have been developed in order to level the playing field and provide services for domestic and foreign,
small and large businesses; these include adoption o f Law on Commercial Banks, Secure Transactions
Law, revision of Presidential Decree on precious metals and foreign exchange, and regulations on deposit
taking and non-deposit taking micro-finance institutions.

70.     The government has entered regional and international agreements that require increased
transparency and commitments to specific economic policies by member states. Lao PDR has joined
ASEAN/AFTA, and i s committed to accessing the WTO. I t has also a member o f the World Customs
Organization (WCO). In 2005/6, Lao PDR undertook a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) in
order to identify the main constraints to improved trade performance. Based on the DTIS "Action Matrix",
the Government i s now working to systematically address these constraints, build institutional capacity and
to simplify and streamline the regulatory environment for trade. Lao PDR has also made progress on i t s
commitments to reduce tariffs under regional agreements and other related reforms.

IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

LINK TO CAS

71.          The PRSO program i s an integral component of the CAS, supporting its pillars, achieving
the outcomes, and contributing to its risk management strategy. The CAS Progress Report discussed
in May 2007 includes a provision o f US$10 million for each o f the PRSOs 4-7 operations. Component 1
o f PRSO and i t s subcomponents support the first pillar o f the Bank's CAS objective - to sustain growth       ,

through managing key growth drivers. Component 2 o f PRSO and i t s subcomponents support the second
pillar o f the CAS, especially where it concerns strengthening public financial management to improve the
social outcomes. PRSO also helps to manage risks identified in the CAS, especially those related to weak
implementation capacity and to fluctuating political environment. The second series o f PRSOs will
continue i t s strong contribution to the third pillar o f the CAS and to establishing and implementing a
capacity building strategy and partnerships, though identifying capacity constraints in all sectors o f
operation, addressing them though TA and an extensive PRSO dialogue, and through attracting strong




                                                    24
partnerships under PRSO umbrella. The latter reflects the recent co-financing o f the PRSOs by the
European Commission, Japan, and Australia.

72.        The amount o f grant allocated to PRSO-5 i s US$20 million equivalent (including the
US$10 million increase on the basis o f need for assisting Lao PDR manage the impact o f the global
financial crisis). A higher amount for PRSO-5 i s not linked to performance against reforms set out in the
agreed policy matrix, but justified on the basis o f higher financing gap, as the government faces a prospect
o f higher f iscal deficits in 2009-10 due to projected shortfalls in revenues due to the slowdown in
economic growth on account o f the global financial crisis. Future decisions on the amounts o f PRSOs
remaining in this series (PRSO-6 to PRSO-7) will be taken based on performance relative to agreed policy
reforms to be supported by these operations, and possibly the Lao PDR's budget support needs at the time
in the context o f the global economic crisis.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

73.     The PRSO program plays a focal role in supporting the policy reform dimensions o f other
Bank operations, both ongoing and as envisaged in the CAS, and i s in turn supported by other Bank
operations. The PRSO framework provides a platform for policy reforms that complements interventions
within other sectoral investment operations. Inter alia, this means that PRSO supports key policy reforms
that are then implemented with support from other Bank operations. Over time, a satisfactory policy-based
operation aims to provide IDA with convincing evidence that the country's policies and institutions are
improving and thus allow more resources to be made available for both sectoral investment operations and
budget support.

74.     PRSOs are a critical element o f the Bank's support for NT2. The World Bank support for the
N T 2 project was based on a decision framework with three key elements: (i) PDR establishing and
                                                                                 Lao
implementing viable development policies, characterized by concrete performance, and national programs
for poverty reduction and social and environmental protection; (ii)  sound technical, financial, economic
and implementation aspects o f the proposed project, as well as the design and implementation o f
safeguards policies; and (iii) wider understanding and broader support from the international donor
community and global and local civil society for Lao PDR's development framework and the proposed
project. The PRSOs support the implementation o f development policies, and national programs for
poverty reduction and social and environmental protection, as referenced in the first element o f the N T 2
decision framework. The links to N T 2 entail a high degree o f scrutiny o f the reform program, including
the PRSO program, through annual consultations with N T 2 partners, the International Advisory Group and
ultimately through dissemination o f information to the donor community and the wider public.

75.     A key component o f the series supports the Government's program for improvement in
transparency and effectiveness in public expenditure management, as laid out in its Public Finance
Management Strengthening Program (PFMSP). The PFMSP inter alia supports the implementation o f
the N T 2 revenues management arrangements which are aimed at providing additional resources in support
o f poverty reduction and environmental protection programs, to be selected according to an agreed set o f
eligibility criteria.

76.    The Financial Management Capacity Building Project (FMCBP) i s designed to finance
technical assistance and capacity building needs to support the implementation o f the Government's
structural reform programs in public financial management, SOCB reform, SOE reform and enterprise
development, FMCBP has already been used to finance various PRSO-related activities, including
independent audits o f SOEs and SOCBs under PRSOs 1 to 4; provision o f technical assistance for revising
the chart o f accounts and realigning the budget nomenclature, training o f staff, procurement o f hardware to
improve management o f state assets, and the recruitment o f technical assistance under the PEMSP.


                                                     25
FMCBP has recently been restructured to provide additional financing on grant terms, to assist the
Government in scaling up the capacity building needs for the PFMSP, implementation of the revised
Budget Law, and reforms envisaged under the PRSOs. The FMCBP i s also supporting capacity
strengthening at the SAO, in close coordination with on-going T A from ADB.

77.   AusAID, the EC, SIDA, and SDC have also established a multi-donor trust fund managed by
the World Bank to support the implementation o f the PFMSP. This multi-donor trust fund will be an
important vehicle for providing untied additional resources to the Government for implementation o f the
PFMSP, including support for implementation o f the new Budget Law. The MDTF will also be an
appropriate vehicle for improving donor coordination and harmonization.

78.    The Lao Customs and Trade Facilitation Project (LCTFP) which was approved in June 2008
contributes to the Government's reform and modernization o f Customs. The project facilitates trade
by improving the efficiency and effectiveness o f customs administration. I t i s expected to simplify
customs procedures, eliminate duplication and redundancy, reduce transaction costs and time to clear
goods, and increase transparency and accountability. The project was built on the results o f A A A work
including DTIS and ICA and supports the reform agenda to sustain fast export-driven growth in the
medium- and long- term. The major reforms in trade facilitation and other trade-related areas are
supported through the PRSO program, Component 1. The Multi-Donor Trust Fund for a Trade
Development Facility managed by the World Bank with contributions from EC and Australia i s also
supporting this program and provides technical assistance to improve competitiveness, business
environment, standards, information technology for border operations and inter-agency coordination, and
implementation support for a sector-wide approach in trade.

79.    The M O F and the World Bank are also preparing the Treasury Modernization Project which
aims to deploy an integrated Treasury Information Management System across the Government.
This proposed project, expected to be presented to the Executive Board in November 2009, builds on the
support provided by the FMCBP and the PFMSP multi-donor trust fund towards modernization o f the
Government budget execution system and put in place procedures on budget execution that would further
tighten fiduciary controls and increase speed o f budget execution.

LESSONS LEARNED

80.     The World Bank has a long track record in policy lending to the Lao PDR since 1989. For
the period o f 1989 to 2001 however, the experience was uneven. The outcome o f the first three Structural
                              ''
Adjustment Credits (SAC) was rated by the Bank's Operations Evaluation Department (OED) - now
renamed Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) - as unsatisfactory, mainly due to feeble Government
commitment to the reform program and weak implementation capacity. OED recommended that future
policy-based operations in the Lao PDR incorporate key lessons from these operations.

81.     These lessons were taken into account in the design o f the programmatic PRSO program for
the first series (PRSOs Nos. 1-3) and the current second programmatic series (PRSOs Nos. 4-7) as
follows:

           Greater inter-ministerial coordination needs to be fostered. The Government has made
           special effort to institute and ensure inter-ministerial coordination through the PRSO Steering
           Committee and i t s Technical Secretariat, with representation across ministries and frequent
           meetings to align implementation strategies and discuss cross-cutting issues. This process i s
           led by the Ministry o f Finance, and the operations processing schedule i s determined by the

I1
                                                                                             1
       The three operations are: SAC I(approved in 1989), SAC I1 (approved in 1991) and SAC 1 1 (approved in 1996).



                                                         26
                Ministry o f Finance. In order to ensure appropriate coordination o f monetary and fiscal policy
                during the financial crisis, the PRSO Steering Committee also includes the Deputy Governor
                o f the Bank o f Lao PDR.

           0    Adequate and appropriate technical assistance and implementation support should be
                provided. In order to assist in effective implementation o f the policy reforms, complementary
                technical assistance i s being provided through the FMCBP and other resources such as the
                PHRD, the MDTF for PEMSP, the Trade Development Facility, and coordinated technical
                support by other development partners.

           0    Take into consideration capacity limitations. The PRSO program was designed as a
                programmatic series to take into account the need to manage reforms in a series o f steps with
                focus on medium-term outcomes and monitorable impacts.

82.        These efforts have contributed to the successful implementation o f the first PRSO series
and a promising beginning o f the second series. Inter-ministerial agency coordination has been vastly
improved through the PRSO process and related dialogues; resulting in real ownership among agencies
and ministries and efficiency in coordination. The impact o f technical assistance provision in selected
areas has been clearly noted. l2 The PRSO program was built upon the Government's own poverty
reduction strategy rather than on an externally imposed framework.

83.          Capacity constraints remain, however. The Government's ability to implement reforms may
have been overestimated during the design o f the first programmatic series. Structural reforms during
transition from a planned to a market economy, such as SOE reform and banking sector reform, need to be
accompanied by several parallel processes before they can be implemented. These require building
understanding o f the meaning o f these reforms, and creating support blocks within the Government. This
suggests the following necessary sequence: improved monitoring, setting targets and monitoring
achievements o f such targets, building incentives system to achieve targets within the public sector, and
finally implementable actions. Building capacity to perform in such complex reforms during this sequence
i s key to'success o f these reforms.

84.      Other concerns about the coverage of PRSO had emerged from the implementation o f the
first series. l3 They include: (i)   recognizing benefits o f greater focus; (ii)identifying and addressing
critical capacity constraints; (iii)fostering ownership by aligning reforms with national development
objectives; (iv) shifting the focus to outcomes; (v) maintaining flexibility in order to achieve these
outcomes; and (vi) aligning the Bank's AAA work with PRSO objectives.

85.     Based on these lessons, the following criteria for triggers and actions have been incorporated
in the current second PRSO series and especially PRSOd. Acceptable triggers should meet the
following criteria that are consistent with good practice on conditionality (see Box 4).

          (a)        Reinforce ownership and be consistent with NSEDPPRS and cover four years (PRSOs 4-
                     7);
          (b)        N o t attempt to fully cover all NSEDP agenda; on the contrary, PRSOs shall help the
                     Government to prioritize the reform agenda in NSEDP;



l2
          For example the public financial management component has showed faster and more profound progress in comparison
to others areas that did not have or have little o f such support, Le., banking reform.
13
          The World Bank and the Government teams have taken stock o f the lessons learned from the implementation of the first
series o f operations, PRSOs Nos. 1-3, during the dialogue on PRSO Nos. 1-3 and during the retreat in Houayxay, Bokeo province.



                                                                   27
        (c)      B e flexibly formulated and be leading t o achievement o f monitorable outcomes based o n
                 programmatic approach. Focus should be more o n a four-year program detiverables rather
                 than o n particular year-by-year actions;

        (d)      B e critical to the achievement o f the series outcomes (growth, poverty reduction, and
                 macro stability);

        (e)      Have lasting effect in improving mechanisms and incentive systems;

        (f)      B e accompanied by TA o n a principle o f mutual accountability.


Box 4: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality Applied in Lao PDR

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
    Ownership o f the PRSO series i s reinforced through program design and participatory and transparent PRS
    process. Recent track record o f Lao PDR indicates continued commitment and ownership o f the program
    supported by PRSOs. The analytical work i s being undertaken by the GOL in close collaboration with
    development partners and i s used in policy and decision making process.
    In order to adjust to a more realistic assessment o f the political commitment to SOE and banking sector agenda,
    during PRS04 the focus o f PRSOS was rightly shifted in direction o f monitoring these sectors while s t i l l trying
    to push forward reforms.
Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework
    Under PRSO series, there i s an agreed accountability framework including a well-defined policy matrix for
    measuring progress under the program.
    This framework however i s not yet harmonized across the donor community, but significant steps are being
    taken to improve aid coordination and harmonization across the board, reflected in signing the Vientiane
    declaration on aid effectiveness (by GOL and 22 development partners). Importantly, cooperation o f the donor
    community behind the current PRS04-7 series has intensified during PRSOS, including joint missions,
    monitoring and evaluation, and strategic planning for PRS06-7.
Principle 3: Customize the accountabilityframework and modalities o Bank support to country circumstances
                                                                   f
    The modalities o f the operation are meeting country needs and encourage public financial management reform.
    However, some adjustments need to be made in the future on the timing o f reforms, particularly in sectors related
    to structural adjustment to a market economy, such as SOEs and banking sector.
    Ownership o f some sensitive policy reforms has been strong (like on trade and public financial management),
    however it was weaker on other issues (such as SOE reform and state-owned banks reform).
    The evidence amounts that policies supported under PRSOs reflect Government's expressed policy intentions
    and are aligned with the NSEDP.
Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement and supported with
Technical Assistance
    Prior actions and conditions chosen from the agreed accountability framework are focused on critical actions for
    achieving the objectives o f the program. Country circumstances and advancement o f structural reforms however
    dictate specific approach to achieving the objectives o f the program.
    Ensure that corresponding technical assistance i s identified up-front where development partners commit to
    providing assistance to implement the reforms, and mechanisms exist for reinforcing the principle o f mutual
    accountability.




                                                          28
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support
0    The PRSOs support i s aligned with the budget cycle and i s disbursed prior to the end of the Government's fiscal
     year in September. Regular reviews are done through frequent assessment missions and RTM and annual plan
     processes are incorporated into the routine monitoring of progress on actions and triggers. Result focus o f these
     reviews should however be strengthened i the future.
                                                 n
0    For the proposed PRSOS, the size and coverage o f the policy matrix has been set ensuring that the interventions
     are at the reform frontier, whilst ensuring that implementation capacity i s there
     I t i s hoped that for PRS05-7, analytic work will be fed more upstream into the policy dialogue, building on the
     achievements o f the analytical work during recent years that has been participatory and increasingly owned by
     the Government.




ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

86.     The analytical under innings the PRSO series were extensively reviewed in the Program
Document for the PRSO-4!          The review discussed the series o f AAA completed and ongoing,
including the Budget L a w Implementation Plan (2007), the first Public Expenditure Tracking Survey
(PETS, 2007), a Public Expenditure Review and Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (PER-IFA 2007), Lao
Financial Sector Study (2006), Country Economic Memorandum (2004), a Poverty-Environment Nexus
Study (2002), Lao Poverty Assessment Country Procurement Assessment Review (2002), a Poverty
Study (2002), a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (2002), and a Public Expenditure Review
(2002). More recently, the analytical work includes the Lao Poverty Assessment, PSIA; the Diagnostic
Trade Integration Study (DTIS); and an Investment Climate Assessment (ICA). As part o f the N T 2
revenue management arrangements, the Government has undertaken to conduct a PER and a PETS every
two years, building on those currently under way. These studies have been prepared by Bank staff in
collaboration with the Government.

87.     As noted in the Program Document for PRSO-4, the strategy underpinning the Bank's AAA
program i s to identify and fill key knowledge-gaps with an emphasis on joint work with the
Government and other development agencies to bring about a buy-in on the diagnosis from all
stakeholders. The results o f this AAA process were used to build consensus on policy reform, sector
investments, and harmonization o f donor assistance in key areas. These are reflected in the NSEDP as
well as i t s implementation. Several o f these studies have been prepared in collaboration with other
donors including the IMF, ADB, UN, and EC, as well as other agencies.

88.     The World Bank has been providing significant technical support to the Government for
implementation of the public finance management strengthening program and the N T 2 Revenue
Management Arrangements (RMA). This support has permitted policy dialogue and close. collaboration
on central-local fiscal relations and the revenue sharing framework as well as on revision o f the chart o f
accounts along with budget nomenclatures. This activity has been instrumental in ensuring appropriate
implementation support be provided to the Government on complex public finance management reforms.

89.      The Government and development partners are preparing the PER-IFA for FY2009, and
the PEFA Performance Measurement Framework. The results from this analytical work will provide
further insight into the design o f the upcoming PRSO operations. This will include focus on the fiduciary
framework o f the Government. This PER-IFA would analyze progress o f the P F M reform program since
2004, including implementation o f the N T 2 RMA, and considers the challenges and priorities for the

14
         World Bank, Program Document for PRSO-4, May 15,2008, pp. 26-29.



                                                         29
reform program looking ahead. In this regard, the PER-IFA would recommend any re-prioritization
within the reform program. The PEFA assessment will present a snap shot o f the status o f the P F M
system in Lao PDR and will help refine the Government's PFMSP program accordingly.

90.     A Report on the Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC) i s under way at the request
from MOF. The main purpose i s to provide findings and recommendations to strengthen enterprises
accounting and auditing practices, in order to foster the quality and reliability o f enterprises financial
reporting, thereby contributing to improved business environment and investment climate in the country.
The ROSC will specifically address the systemic and governance requirements that are necessary for
improved competitiveness in world markets, an enhanced financial sector, and a strengthened enterprise
accounting and auditing practice in the country. It aims to provide policy recommendations for necessary
actions towards implementation o f international corporate accounting and auditing standards;
strengthening the profession and improving the capacity o f professional bodies; introducing appropriate
mechanisms for ensuring compliance with enterprises accounting and auditing requirements; and
developing arrangements for high quality accounting and auditing education and training. The policy
recommendations from the ROSC review will provide a framework for preparing an Action Plan for the
reform o f accounting and auditing practices in Lao PDR.

91.      The upcoming AAA work will help to refine the design o f subsequent operations. In
particular, the PRSOs will build upon findings o f the Country Economic Memorandum on natural
resource management (scheduled for delivery in FY2009), Financial Sector Strategy (FY2009), Health
Financing Policy Note (FY2009), Teachers Study (FYOS), Education for All Assessment (FY09), C i v i l
Service Pay and Compensation Review (FY2009), Study on Trade in Services (FY09), Uplands
Livelihood Typology and I C A (FY2009), subsequent PER (FY2009), the update o f the Investment
Climate Assessment (FY2010), next PETS (FY2010), next Poverty Assessment (2010), and other studies.
Regular policy notes and small AAAs will also contribute to the overall program and allow for mid-term
corrections where needed, including Environmental Monitors and Economic Monitors.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

92.     Since April 2005, the Fund has conducted an annual Article I V consultation as well as
prepared half-yearly macroeconomic assessment letters. The Bank and the Fund staff collaborate
closely during these annual consultations in the context o f the PRSO program. The IMF's last Article I V
consultation was completed in M a y 2009. The next consultations activity i s scheduled for M a y 2010.
Findings o f the latest mission have been reflected in the Program Document. The IMF will provide an
assessment letter for PRSO-5.

93.     PRSOs in Lao PDR are characterized by a framework o f evolving partnership between
Government and donors, and have become an important new aid modality and a vehicle for donor
harmonization and policy coordination. During the preparation o f PRSC- 1 through PRSO-4, and the
current PRSO-5, discussions were held with major development partners including the IMF, EC, Japan,
and the ADB. For PRSOs 4-7, the matrix was appraised jointly by the three donors co-financing the
program: Japan, European Commission, and Australia. The World Bank and donor team inform the
donor community on the progress with PRSOs and encourage other donors' participation.

94.      Australia, represented by AusAID, has decided to co-finance PRSO-5 and future operations
and i s also providing complementary TA support via two World Bank-managed multi-donor trust
funds for public finance management strengthening program and the Trade Development Facility.
Australia has been actively participating in the PRSO series, as well as in the PFMSP and trade
development. Australia's special focus i s on ensuring that P F M reforms lead to enhanced resources for
social sectors, delivered in a timely manner to service delivery units, as well as in implementation o f the


                                                    30
trade facilitation action plan. Australia i s very active in the social sectors, especially in education, where
it i s supporting the Government in developing the Education Sector Development Plan and corresponding
annual prioritized and costed action plan. Australia continues to participate actively in PRSO
preparations. The Policy Action Matrix (Annex 2) incorporates AusAID's focus areas.

95.      The European Commission's participation in the joint PRSO-5 preparation missions
focused on PRSO discussions as well as on additional support to the Government's NSEDP reform
agenda in the Public Finance Management, Private Sector Development and Trade sectors, with a special
focus on channeling resources to pro-poor priorities o f the Government in Education and Health sectors.
The Financing Agreement with the Government o f Lao PDR to support the PRS04 to 7 implementation
o f Euro13 million, was signed at end-2008. This agreement includes the use o f indicators to measure
Government's performance in the health and education sectors. The achievement o f the agreed targets will
result in the disbursement o f an annual variable tranche, starting from PRSO-5. The set o f three indicators
per sector for the variable tranche are already incorporated into the Policy Action Matrix (Annex 2).

96.      The Government o f Japan has participated in the policy dialogue in PRSOs 4-7, however it
has not yet decided whether o r not to provide financial support to Government in this regard.
Japan's interests in policy dialog l i e in the following areas. In Component 1 (Investment Climate,

Management, including monitoring o f external debt and periodical publication. Japan's interests also
include Improving Service Delivery (Education and Health) as another important sector. These interests
have been included in the Policy Action Matrix, as reflected in Annex 2. However, the Government o f
Japan has not decided whether or not to provide financing to Lao PDR for PRSO-4 and PRSO-5.

97.     Other donors provide grants for technical assistance in support o f policy reforms and
capacity building. The PRSO program has an ambitious agenda, and grant-based technical assistance
plays an important role. Several donors have already provided this assistance. JBIC financed consulting
services to the Business Promotion Office (BPO) in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) to support the
development o f SOE restructuring plans under the PRSO-2 and PRSO-4, and will provide similar support
under PRSO-5. The Government o f Japan provided a PHRD grant for technical assistance to the Lao
PDR under PRSO-3, and an application i s being made for a similar grant for PRSO-5. The EC, ADB and
Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) financed technical assistance to support the PRSO-
linked Public Expenditure Review (PER) and are supporting the Public Expenditure Management
Strengthening Program (PEMSP). The PRSO process has involved close collaboration with many other
donor-supported initiatives - notably, the ADB's work on banking reform, SIDA's work on tax reform
and the United Nations Development Program's work on governance and public administration reform.

V.      THE PROPOSED OPERATION

OPERATION DESCRIPTION
98.                   --
         The PRSO-5 which i s jointly prepared by the Government and I D A and in collaboration
with co-financing donors -- i s the second operation o f the second PRSO series (PRSOs 4-7) in
support the implementation of Lao PDR's Poverty Reduction Strategy which i s articulated in the
Sixth NSEDP. In particular, the PRSO-5 w i l l assist the government to continue cross-cutting reforms in a
consistent framework, while the financial support provided will contribute to reduce the gap between the
costs o f implementing key elements o f this strategy and the resources available from the Government's
own revenues and other donors' support. In addition, the financing mobilized through this operation will
be particularly u s e h l in combating the negative effects o f the global financial crisis.

99.     The PRSO-5 seeks to support policies that ensure sustained growth and improved revenue
mobilization in the medium term, thereby increasing resources available to be used for
implementing the poverty reduction strategy. PRSO-5 focuses on two broad policy areas consistent
with the goals and strategies identified by the Government in i t s PRS, and reflected in the World Bank's
CAS in the following way: (1) sustainable growth; and (2) public resource management and public
expenditure management. Increased growth and improved management o f public resources will ensure
that additional resources are available for implementing the poverty reduction strategy, and that these
resources are deployed more effectively and efficiently towards improving social outcomes.
100. Progress in these policy areas enables a continuation o f the good macroeconomic
performance, continued progress with poverty reduction, as well as managing the impact of the
global financial crisis. As programmatic budget support, the PRSO program will contribute to funding
predictability, and the associated dialogue between the Government and donors to ensure sensible policy
prioritization and good donor coordination. At the same time the reforms supported by the PRSO will
ensures that scare available resources, which have been falling due to the onset o f the global financial
crisis, are deployed more strategically and effectively.

101. Building on the track record o f the PRSOs 1-4 and increased implementation capacity, the
PRSO-5 continues to focus on frontier and cross-cutting reforms in each o f the PRSO focus area.
PRSOs 1-4 have put in place a strong platform for programmatic policy reform, an appropriate legislative
and institutional framework (especially in the public finance management framework), strengthened
capacity o f government, and helped put in place a robust foundation o f these reforms. The collaboration
between the Government and development partners has also been significantly strengthened. The PRSO-
5 i s expected to take the policy reform program to a higher technical level and focuses on implementation
o f the laws and institutional restructuring.

 102. The policy reform framework o f the PRSO seeks to balance ambition with ownership, by
focusing on institutionallychallenging high value reforms which are at the implementation capacity
frontier of Lao PDR. The PRSO policy reform framework has been developed by analyzing the binding
institutional and policy level reforms tin each sector, and then jointly identifying with the Government
those reforms that are at the frontier o f the capacity and political economy frontier. In doing so, the
PRSO builds on the reform momentum achieved during PRSOs 1-4 and supports binding reforms at a
pace that i s consistent with the implementation capacity o f Lao PDR. For example, in the public financial
management component, the implementation of the Treasury Single Account framework i s a high value
reform for establishing improved controls over public finances, requires significant technical capacity to
implement, and high level political commitment to drive through. Similarly, putting in place a framework
for trade facilitation action plan requires high level coordination between government agencies that i s
very difficult technically to achieve in a fragmented responsibility framework such as that in Lao PDR.



                                                   32
COMPONENT 1: INVESTMENT CLIMATE, COMPETITIVENESS, AND BUSINESS
DEVELOPMENT

103.      The NSEDP estimates that the necessary level of investment to achieve targeted economic
growth rate will be around 26-28 percent o f GDP, from which 16-17 percent i s expected to be
mobilized from the private sector, including FDI. Recently, the country had enjoyed similar volumes of
FDI, but this has fallen (and expected to remain at lower level) due t o the global financial crisis and i s
also directed toward the natural resource sector, and investment in other sectors would be needed to
achieve targeted growth. As discussed above, the NSEDP sets an ambitious growth target o f 7 percent
per year for 2006-2010, with the objective to graduate from the least developed country (LDC) status by
2020.

 104.     Notwithstandingthe achievements o f PRSOs 1-4, significant constraints to doing business
remain for the private sector, including poor infrastructure, cumbersome regulations, discretionary
taxation, limited access to finance, and limited access to essential information and business support
services. These need to be improved so that when the global economy recovers, Lao i s much better
positioned to attract FDI.

 105.       Exporters face a higher regulatory burden than non-exporters. Analytical studies,
conducted by the World Bank in close cooperation with other development partners, identify and
prioritize key constraints to a strong investment climate and export competitiveness in Lao PDR. The
Joint W B / A D B Investment Climate Assessment concludes that the priorities in improving the investment
climate should be to improve infrastructure, especially electricity transmission lines, streamline
regulations, eliminate discretion in taxation, improve access to formal sources o f finance, and to improve
regulations and processes specific to exporting and importing goods. Studies have also highlighted the
differences between the investment climate for exporters and non-exporters and identified trade-related
regulations and processes as key constraints. As the Lao PDR faces an increasingly challenging external
trade environment in 2009/10, it i s important to maintain momentum in efforts to streamline and simplify
the regulatory environment for trade as a means to improve competitiveness and partly to mitigate the
effects o f lower world demand for Lao exports.

 106.      Lao PDR has an underdeveloped financial sector with little intermediation which i s
struggling to provide services to a growing private sector. Based on data from the BOL, the formal
banking sector lending only accounted for 8 percent o f GDP in 2007 and increased to around 10 percent
by the end o f 2008. The sector has remained highly liquid, with a l o w share o f loans to deposits ratio. In
2008 the ratio o f loans to deposits at year end was 36.7 percent, and rose to 50.4 percent at end-2008. At
the same time, physical penetration o f bank branches i s among the lowest in the world, with
approximately 1 branch per 100,000 people at the end o f September 2008. The recent effort o f the
Government to improve legal and regulatory environment, in particular promulgation o f the new law on
commercial banks, has brought about the establishment o f the new privately Lao-owned Phongsavanh
Bank, which continues to open new branches and the entry o f Acleda Bank o f Cambodia which has
recently established a subsidiary, Acleda Bank Lao. In addition, the action has encouraged foreign
investment such as that o f Australia and New Zealand Bank (ANZ) and the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) jointly invested and formed ANZ Vientiane Commercial Bank Limited. Most recently,
the I C B Bank (Lao) and Indo China Bank officially opened in October 2008 and January 2009
respectively. The SOCBs have suffered from high N P L ratios, directed policy lending, and high loans
concentration. Recently, two major SOCBs have significantly improved their operating performance, and
B C E L has significantly reduced i t s NPLs by a balance sheet operation and strengthened monitoring o f
new loans (using an international banking adviser). During PRSOs 1-4, the supervision function o f the
BOL and M O F was strengthened. The three major banks signed Governance Agreements to comply with



                                                     33
prudential regulations and committed to keeping to the operational and financial targets outlined in these
agreements.

107.       The SOEs under the restructuring programs supported by PRSO account for 85 percent
o f the total revenues generated by the whole state-owned sector. This sector i s relatively small with
less than 10,000 employees. Hence the potential risk associated with it in comparison to an average
transition economy i s small. Reforms implemented in the early 1990s reduced the number o f SOE sector
substantially. Total losses b y SOEs represent 0.5 percent o f GDP in 2006 and have been declining fast
during the recent years, while profits have also been growing.

 108.   Seven SOEs under restructuring programs generated profits in 2006, however the impact of
the global financial crisis will affect profitability o f SOE's negatively. T o assist the SOE restructuring
process with support from the World Bank, BPO under the P M O conducted independent financial audits
for FY2005 and FY2006 for 4 Phase I1 SOEs and 3 Phase ISOEs. At present, BPO i s working with
4 Phase I1 SOEs to develop restructuring plans, which are ex ected to be completed in early 2009.
Analysis o f available financial information from various source$ indicated that 7 out o f 13 SOEs under
restructuring generated profit during 2006, with profit margin ranging from 0.68 - 16.95 percent o f total
sales. Key findings o f the independent audits include: i)  weak control over fixed assets, cash, purchases,
trade and other payables; ii)absence or inadequate documentary support for the cost and revaluation o f
fixed assets, trade payables; iii)lack o f comprehensive accounting policies and procedural manuals; lack
o f proper budget plans and projected cash flow; iv) some o f the audited SOEs had negative equity and
high liquidity risk. The global financial crisis and the consequent fall in economic activity will affect the
profitability o f SOE's negatively, and in order to mitigate this impact, it i s important for the Government
to move on addressing the aforementioned weaknesses.

109.     I n order to make significant progress in SOE reform, it i s essential to adopt far-reaching
policy decisions to improve performance o f SOE sector through defining strategic and non-strategic
SOEs; withdrawing from non-strategic ones; clarifying the role o f BPO; corporatizing strategic SOEs;
strengthening state-assets value management; and.enhancing shareholder functions o f the MOF. This will
be the focus o f this and subsequent PRSOs, however due to the global financial crisis and the credit
crunch, it may be: (i)  politically difficult to corporatize SOEs; and (ii)
                                                                          difficult to attract foreigdlocal
private sector stakeholders to play an active role in SOEs.

110.        The Government has reduced the stock and accumulation o f arrears between government
agencies and Electricite` du Laos (EDL), and there i s need to ensure arrears are eliminated and a
mechanism i s put in place that ensures any in-year arrears are promptly reconciled and settled. In
order to stay on track with the "Action Plan for Financial Sustainability o f the Power Sector" (Action
Plan), EDL has increased tariffs and operational efficiency, while the Government has endorsed the EDL
tariff increase annually and significantly reduced the stock o f arrears accumulated up to FY2005/06 and
stayed on track with mutual clearances o f arrears. Budget allocations for electricity consumption have
been increased and accumulation o f arrears has slowed down significantly as a result. The Government
has set up a high-level committee chaired by the Minister o f Finance and two sub-committees to deal with
clearance o f the accumulated arrears, as well as with elimination o f arrears in the future. EDL has
conducted a study on energy savings to assist the Government in appropriate budget allocations by
ministry. There will be need to ensure that arrears are not accumulated due to the current revenue
shortfall being experienced in the FY2008/09 Budget.

111.      The Government continues to create a level playing field in the banking sector by opening
up the sector to domestic and international private sector stakeholders, develop a financial sector
strategy, and improve business environment. Measures included enhancing commercialization of
SOCBs, and revising legal basis for promoting private participationin the banking sector, promoting non-
banking financial products and developing favorable environment for developing sustainable micro-
finance; as well as by improving state owned entities efficiency, strengthening SOE monitoring capacity,
improving regulatory environment for SOEs, and developing and implementing strategic plan for SOE
reform.

 112.      Several important legislative and regulatory instruments have recently been issued to
enhance an enabling business environment. These include the Enterprise Law, the Law on
Commercial Banks, regulations to improve trade facilitation and more streamlined import and export
procedures. The Government has also begun the process of reviewing existing legal framework for
investment promotion and the existing mining law. Progress has also been made in the trade reform
agenda, including international and regional integration. Th ese include such milestones as: (i)      the
adoption of the first SME Development Strategy, which outlines specific measures for improving the
business environment; (ii)    establishment of high level National Steering Committee for Economic
Integrationto oversee efforts to integrate with regional and internationaltrading systems to harmonize the
trade related aid; and (iv) development o f the National Trade Facilitation Master Plan to streamline and
subsequently automate procedures for import and export..

113.       The triggers and policy actions for PRSO-5 and subsequent operations are designed to
foster productive long-term investment through an enabling environment for regional integration,
private sector development, and natural resource management, based on findings o f a range o f AAA
work done by the World Bank and other development partners during the past several years. I n
particular, the agenda o f PRSO 5-7 serves the following purposes, and take the following actions to
achieve them:

        Create and sustain an enabling business environment and attract quality investment. This
        subcomponent supports Government's efforts to develop two important laws, namely the
        Investment Promotion Law and Mining law; implement business registration and licensing
        reform in non-resource sectors. 16

        Proceed with implementation o f trade facilitation reforms through revising the Customs Law
        and developing relevant implementingregulations and guidelines; developing and implementing
        a national trade facilitation action plan to promote simplification, harmonization, transparency
        and automation in customs and other border procedures; implementing customs modernization
        and preparing for the introduction of the national single window in the future; increasing
        compatibility with internationaland best practice standards by complying with ASEAN and WTO
        standards;

        Improve the performance and monitoring o f SOEs. The PRSOs 5-7 policy framework builds
        on the successes of PRSOs 1-4 and aims to assist the government's effort in improving efficiency
        and effectiveness of strategic SOEs; transforming non-strategic SOEs and liquidating non-
        commercially viable businesses, and strengthening the role of MOF as the designated share
        holder of SOEs; developing and implementing strategic plan for SOE reform; and settlement of
        past electricity arrears and setting up a system that would preclude future arrears;



16
       Agriculture, light manufacturing, processing industries and services.



                                                            35
    0   Enhance commercializationand transparency o f SOCBs. The sub-components seek to further
        improve the depth and outreach o f the financial sector through the following key areas: (i)taking
        an integrated approach to financial sector reform through developing and implementing
        comprehensive financial sector strategy; (ii) strengthening the banking sector through
        concentrating on the transformation o f the SOCBs; (iii)     enhancing banking supervision and
        regulation; and (iv) developing sustainable microfinance regulatory and institutional framework.

 114. Among PRSO actions, those related to natural resource management are also important for
mitigating macroeconomic and fiscal risks. The policy actions within the PRSO aim to improve the
overall legal framework o f the extractive industries, with the World Bank Group providing technical
assistance to the Government for developing a new Minerals Law. At the same time the on-going work in
the P F M programs aims to strengthen the overall financial management system to better account for, plan,
and report resources from the extractive industries. The PRSO i s also supporting the Government on
consultations on the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI). These measures are important
steps in ensuring poverty reduction through channeling resource revenues to the poor.

COMPONENT 2: PUBLIC FINANCE MANAGEMENT AND IMPROVING SERVICE
DELIVERY

Public Finance Management

115.     The PFM component o f the PRSOs 5-7 focuses on key cross-cutting PFM reforms, and
balances policy reforms with implementation capacity. Component elements are a logical extension
o f the achievements and program direction set out in PRSOs 1-4, and support implementation o f the N T 2
RMA. The thrust o f the public financial management reforms continues on deepening them whilst
focusing on implementation o f policy reforms undertaken by the Government to strengthen the central-
local fiscal framework, improving budget planning and execution, implementation o f the legislative acts
adopted under PRSOs 1-4, and focus on improving service delivery in health and education.

116. PRSOs 5-7 continue to support the broader program o f reform in public financial
management. The PRSOs 4-7 components are integral and critical policy milestones o f a larger public
finance management strengthening program (PFMSP) which i s also supporting implementation o f the
N T - 2 R M A s , where the Bank i s providing significant staff time support and financial resources. In this
regard the Bank and development partners have established a multi-donor trust fund to support PFMSP
implementation. Triggers and policy actions for the Public Finance Management component under
PRSOs 5-7 were reached at by applying the following filters to PFMSP elements:

        Central and critical to achieving PFMSP outcomes. Each trigger and policy action represents
        policy milestones and decisions at the center o f the core PFMSP. The PRSO incorporates key
        milestones in the centralization and revenue sharing aspects under a logical program
        implementation framework such as the development o f a new revenue sharing framework, and
        clarification o f expenditure assignments by different levels o f government for health and
        education sectors represents policy-heavy actions requiring significant analytical work,
        implementation capacity, and political support;

        Aimed at addressing high value cross-sectoral policy bottlenecks and not related to day-to-
        day business processes o f government. Program elements, especially triggers, should focus on
        implementation o f cross-sectoral P F M issues that are o f critical and central nature for improving
        the fiduciary environment and strengthening service delivery. In this regard for example, the
        development and implementation o f the Treasury Single Account gets into the core o f financial



                                                     36
         management in a fiduciary sensitive area requiring significant high level and technical level
         coordination and business process re-engineering;

     0   Elements should be part of on-going Government reform elements with technical assistance
         being provided to implementation. Each element of the PRSOs 5-7 policy matrix i s derived
         from on-going government reform program and also introduces pay and compensation reforms
         (starting in PRSO-6)17. A key aspect that the PRSOs 4-7 reinforces i s that o f mutual
         accountability, i.e., Government has undertaken to carry out wide ranging reforms, and in this
         regard development partners have pledged to provide technical assistance with implementation.
         All stakeholders will be accountable for delivering on promised actions.

 117. M O F adopted and commenced implementationo f the Treasury Single Account framework,
by consolidating all revenue accounts into Treasury-managed accounts. Since the promulgation of
the Budget Law in 2007, the Government has put in place the necessary legislative framework for
centralizing the Treasury Department, including transferring the control o f bank accounts from ministries
and provincial finance departments to MOF, within a Treasury Single Account framework. The
implementation of this policy has been progressing in a systematic manner. To date, MOF has managed
to gain control over all provincial treasury accounts, extra-budgetary funds like the road fund, and bank
accounts of line ministries. Revenues collected by the tax and customs departments are deposited into
these bank accounts. Approximately 80 percent of total public finances flow through these accounts. The
remaining 20 percent represent bank accounts held by spending agencies collecting technical revenues.
This i s a major achievement in terms of establishingcentralized control and oversight over public monies.
However, the Treasury Department i s now strengthening to monitor those accounts held by spending
agencies collecting technical revenues and to gradually bring them into the budget, thereby broadening
the budget coverage.

118.    Improving operational effectiveness o f the Government's budget monitoring system and
migration to an integrated Treasury Information Management System (TIMS) i s important for
improved expenditure management and disclosure o f key fiscal information. Assistance has been
provided to ensure real-time connectivity o f GFIS to provinces and line ministries and central agencies,
and the reprogramming of core GFIS system to manage the new Chart o f Accounts (COA), and to
produce consolidated budget execution reports. This has meant that for FY2008/09 the Government will
be able to provide quarterly budget execution reports, as well as reduce the lead time on publication o f
budget appropriations information. At the same time, the Government i s conducting a technical needs
assessment for deployment of an integrated financial management information system and a countrywide
payment settlements system to enable better control over government financial resources, provision of
more accurate, comprehensive and timely information for decision making and accountability and thus
improving the overall fiduciary environment. The World Bank i s working with the ADB to provide
coordinated assistance for improving operational effectiveness o f GFIS, as well as preparing a new
Treasury ModernizationProject for TIMS deployment.

119. The PRSO-5 supports the efforts o f the State Audit Organization (SAO) in improving the
quality and timeliness o f financial audit. SA0 completed an Audit Peer Review with SA0 New
Zealand. This Audit Peer Review has capacity gaps for strengthening the quality and timeliness of
financial audits and progressively moving towards performance audits. In order to ensure that capacity
building support i s provided in a consistent and coherent manner, the PRSO program i s supporting the
development o f a capacity building plan reflecting the findings o f the Audit Peer Review report. The
World Bank, ADB and other development partners will provide support to the SA0 to implement this

17
          The Government and World Bank are undertaking a Comprehensive Pay and Compensation Review which will be
finalized by June 2009, and provide the analytical underpinningsfor developing t h i s component further from PRSO-6 onwards.



                                                            37
plan, with the aim o f improving the quality and timeliness o f financial audits in the f i r s t instance, and
developing capacity for conducting performance audits in the future. Improving financial audit i s also a
key aspect o f the N T 2 RMA.

120.     The central-local relations reforms envisaged in PRSOs 4-7 are progressing and positive
developments have emerged. Since the promulgation o f the Budget L a w 2007, the Government has
been taking steps towards making the budget allocation system more transparent and rules based. In this
regard, the MOF's Budget Department has been leading the work on developing a new revenue sharing
model and a system o f budget norms for the education and health sector. Since 2008/09 the Government
has managed to mandate minimum spending on health and education sector by provinces. Additionally,
the revenue sharing model has been discussed and approved by the Government for application to the
FY2010/11. M O F has also developed a strategy for implementation o f the budget norms from
FY2010/11. This work will entail: (i)  clarification o f expenditure assignments between central and local
government levels in the health and education sectors; (ii) and scenario analysis from introduction o f
                                                            data
high level norms initially and progressively detailed ones in latter years; (iii)
                                                                                significant political support
and implementation capacity. The PRSOs 5-7 will support these elements for developing the new
revenue sharing framework in Lao PDR.

Improving Service Delivery

Education

121.      Lao PDR has seen substantial growth in primary and secondary enrollment in the last
10 years. Recent data indicate that net primary school enrollment now stands at around 83 percent.
Improvements in net enrollment in recent years have to a significant degree been driven by growth in
female enrollment. Notwithstanding these achievements, enrollment i s often late, a low proportion o f
students complete the full cycle o f primary and secondary school, repetition rates remain high, and there
are concerns about the quality o f education. Moreover, the poorest districts in Lao PDR are experiencing
systematic disadvantages in a range o f educational indicators. While public expenditure on education has
recovered from the financial crisis o f the late 1990s, the level o f spending remains low and heavily reliant
on external financing.

 122.      The Government's education policy focuses on primary education and i s set out in the
NGPES, the NSEDP, and the forthcoming Education Sector Development Framework. The
Government has established the achievement o f universal primary education by 2015 as a primary goal,
with reductions in gender and geographic disparities in access, improvement in the quality and relevance
o f education, and improved education management as key strategies for achieving this goal. While the
policy framework for the education sector emphasizes primary education, it also establishes priorities in
lower secondary education, non-formal and adult education, teacher training, upper secondary, preschool,
tertiary education, and technical education and vocational training. Taken together, the Government's
policy priorities in education signify a substantial financing gap relative to current financing levels.

123.     The actions in the education sector envisioned under PRSOs 5-7 aim to create conditions
for improved strategic prioritization in the allocation of resources and more effective performance
management. The PRSO actions include the following:

    0   Identify strategic direction and resource requirements. The completion o f the Education for
        All Mid-Decade Assessment (EFA MDA) -- in the context o f the development o f a broader
        Education Sector Development Framework -- provides an opportunity for the Ministry o f
        Education (MOE) to take stock o f achievements and challenges in the sector and to identify
        future strategic direction and resource needs.



                                                     38
         Ensure that strategic priorities are reflected in the annual budget process (and eventual
         budget allocations), and that key components o f recurrent spending are increasingly financed
         from domestic sources. These actions are envisioned to complete in the later years o f the
         Program.

    0    Improve the comprehensiveness and reliability o f education information and integrate it
         into the planning and budgeting process. A second set o f actions focus on the Education
         Management Information System (EMIS). Improvement o f the EMIS i s a fundamental step to
         improve performance monitoring and management in the sector, and one o f the requirements for
         the M O E to have access to N T 2 revenues from FY2009/10.

Health

124.      Health outcomes in Lao PDR are improving, but significant challenges remain. According
to available data, under-five mortality f e l l from 170 per 1,000 live births in 1995 to 98 in 2005,
suggesting that Lao PDR i s on track to meet the MDG target related to child mortality. However,
important health challenges remain. Mortality and morbidity remain very high, especially among the
rural population. At least in part, this reflects low levels o f utilization o f health services (including o f key
preventive services such as immunization). Financial barriers and a lack o f qualified personnel in rural
and remote areas comprise key constraints to increasing utilization.

125.      The Government's policy framework for the health sector emphasizes equity and
improved access to primary care. NSEDP endorses the MDGs, establishing improved health outcomes
and enhanced equity in access to basic curative and preventive health services (in terms o f gender,
economic situation, religion, ethnicity, and geography) as key goals for the sector. The Plan recognizes
that a growing reliance on external financing and user fees entails risks in terms o f sustainability and
equity. NSEDP calls for increased government spending, but also for more diversified health financing
arrangements, including piloting and expansion of, inter alia, compulsory health insurance, equity funds,
and community based health insurance. The NSEDP also emphasizes the need to strengthen human
resource management and target attention to priority districts. These goals and priorities resonate well
with the CAS outcomes, which concern government spending on health and access to health services.

 126.      The PRSOs 5-7 supports the Government's policy framework by focusing on key
constraints to improving the performance o f the health system. A first set o f actions focus on health
financing arrangements, including the establishment o f a forum and process for developing a health
financing strategy; piloting o f equity funds to promote access for the poor; routine monitoring o f key
performance indicators in the main health financing schemes; and strengthened evaluation o f health
financing reforms to support policy making. These actions are expected to contribute to a consensus
among key stakeholders about the merits and demerits o f different health financing reform options, and,
in the longer term, to a health financing system that effectively promotes equitable access and financial
protection. A second set o f actions focus on the Health Management Information System (HMIS), with
the aim o f establishing an institutionalized process for routine reporting on key health indicators by 20 11.

127. The Table below summarizes triggers for PRSO5 and progress made by appraisal and
negotiations.

                             Table 5: Summary o f Prior Actions for PRSO-5

Prior Action 1: The Government submitted for approval to the National Assembly a Law on Promotion
o f Investment consistent with Law on Enterprise.

Rationale: With the intention to further improve the overall investment climate in the country, the
Government decided to make further improvement in two existing investment Laws by developing a
new unified Investment Law to promote domestic and foreign investment. Among others, the new draft
law i s expected to provide a level-playing field to both domestic and foreign investors by giving equal
treatment for business entry consistent with the Enterprise Law (2005) and access to unified investment
incentives. This Law was submitted to the National Assembly on November 15, 2008.
Prior Action 2: Ministry o f Industry and Commerce, Ministry o f Finance, and related agencies prepared
detailed draft Trade Facilitation Master Plan, including the Action Plan to implement such master plan.

Rationale: The main objective o f this trigger i s to identify a strategic agenda for improving trade
facilitation in the country. Along with clearly defined vision and priority actions, the Master Plan i s also
expected to outline appropriate implementation structure and clear performance indicators.
Prior Action 3: Bank o f Lao PDR finalized Financial Sector Strategy.

Rationale: The rationale was to ensure that Laos has a comprehensive vision for the future o f i t s entire
financial sector (banking, capital markets, insurance, private pension and supporting financial sector
infrastructure). The strategy while broad based will identify priorities which can be translated into
action plans.

The Bank o f Lao PDR finalized the FSS and under letter o f the Governor transmitted the same to the
Government for approval on February 23,2009.
Prior Action 4: Ministry o f Finance, in collaboration with Ministry o f Health, Ministry o f Education
and 17 provinces, approved a new revenue sharing formula and aggregate budget allocation norms to
guide preparation o f FY2009/10 budget, and finalized a strategy and implementation plan for developing
a sector budget norm-based revenue sharing system for implementation from the FY2010/11 budget.

Rationale: The intention i s to develop and adopt a system o f budget allocation norms to guide the
allocation o f provincial budget for health and education. The norms would serve as mandatory
requirements for minimum spending per capita that provinces will have to follow in allocating their
fiscal resource for education and health spending within the province in FY2009/10 Budget.

Following consultations within the Government and with the provinces, draft Minister o f Finance
Decisions on Revenue sharing and non-salary aggregate budget norms have been finalized and ready to
be signed. In addition, a strategy and implementation plan for developing a sector budget norm-based
revenue sharing system for implementation from the FY2010/11 budget has been finalized and ready for




                                                     40
Prior Action 5: MOF adopted the Treasury Single Account framework by consolidating all revenue
accounts into Treasury managed accounts and started implementation o f this framework.

Rationale: The rationale for this trigger was to ensure that the Treasury Department o f the Ministry of
Finance gains centralized control over spending accounts across the country in order to enhance
fiduciary control over public finances and to improve cash management.

The government has adopted the TSA framework requiring a l l spending agencies to transfer control of
their bank accounts to the centralized national treasury. To date, the Ministry o f Finance has managed to
gain control over a l l provincial treasury accounts, extra-budgetary funds like the road fund, and
budgetary accounts o f line ministries. Budget revenues collected by the tax and customs departments are
deposited into these bank accounts. Approximately 80 percent o f total public finances flow through
these accounts. The remaining 20 percent represent bank accounts held by spending agencies collecting
technical revenues. The MOF plans to continue implementation o f the TSA framework next year by
consolidating these accounts into the Treasury managed accounts. This will be the focus o f the PRSO-6.
Prior Action 6: State Audit Office approved audit strengthening plan based on the Audit Peer Review.

Rationale: The intention o f this action was to assist the SA0 in developing a comprehensive Audit Peer
Review based capacity building and audit strengthening plan. This would help the S A 0 embark on a
well articulated capacity development plan that could be supported by development partners. Improving
financial audit quality and timeliness i s a necessary pillar o f a well functioning public finance
management system. Efforts will in the first instance focus on improving financial audits, while at the
same time work will start on developing capacity performance auditing.


The SA0 has prepared the capacity building plan based on the audit peer review, and shared the same
with the World Bank. I t i s expected that the approval letter by the President o f the SA0 to this capacity
building plan will be obtained by April 29,2009.
Prior Action 7: Ministry o f Education presented annual work plan to Education Sector Working Group,
including costs and priorities, identifying resources needed in FY2009/10 budget.

Rationale: The costed and prioritized annual work plan i s an important tool to enhance the strategic
focus o f the annual planning and budgeting process, and to ensure that both domestic and external
financing sources are considered in the process. The development o f the work plan, as well as detailed
budget preparation process, i s expected to be guided by the ongoing work to develop a comprehensive
education sector strategic framework for the medium to long term.

The MOE presentedthe costed and prioritized annual work plan to ESWG in April 2009.




                                                    41
  128.    The appraisal mission also proposes a l i s t o f prior actions for the PRSO-6.

                       Table 6: Proposed Prior Actions (Triggers) For PRSO-6
Prior Action 1: M P I abolishes investment license for general investment activities outside the Negative L i s t
as part o f the implementation o f the unified Investment Promotion L a w

Prior Action 2: Government approves Prime Minister's Decree o n Import-Export Management and Ministry
o f Industry and Commerce issues implementingregulations based o n this Decree

Prior Action 3: M O F and EDL remain current on settlement o f arrears for FY2004/05 - FY2007/08 and
reconcile any arrears for FY2008/09; MOF provides adequate budgetary allocation for current electricity
consumptions for FY2009/10; MOF and EDL clarify financial arrangements for electricity provision to the
irrigation sector.

Prior Action 4: Bank o f Lao PDR approves the Action Plan for the Financial Sector Strategy

Prior Action 5: Bank o f Lao PDR completes and submits to Ministry o f Finance the Annual On-Site and
Quarterly Off-Site Examination Reports o f Banque du Commerce Exterieur Lao, Lao Development Bank and
Agricultural Promotion Bank.

Prior Action 6: M O F completes centralization o f the National Treasury and consolidates spending unit
technical revenue accounts into Treasury managed accounts.

Prior Action 7: Ministry o f Health finalizes draft Health Financing Strategy after due consultation with
Ministry o f Labor and Social Welfare, Ministry o f Finance, Ministry o f Planning and Investment and other
stakeholders.


  VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

  POVERTY AND S O C I A L IMPACT

   129. Policy actions supported under PRSO-5 are expected to have positive social impacts, and no
  significantly negative impacts are envisaged. On the business development and investment climate
  component, the proposed operation supports measures aimed at improving the financial management o f
  SOE's so that the quality o f their services improves and leakage o f resources i s curtailed. By supporting
  policies to reduce government arrears to EDL, it i s envisaged that EDL will be able to investment more
  resources in improving services and maintain i t s countrywide electricity system better. In addition, clarity
  in the financial arrangements for electricity provision in the agriculture sector would enhance
  transparency in roles and responsibilities o f M O F and EDL, improvement in coordination between these
  two entities to serve users better. This would mean that all users would benefit from better service
  provision. With regards to investment climate reforms, the operation supports greater clarity and
  consistency in the legislative framework relating to investment and doing business, and together with
  supporting the development o f the trade facilitation action plan, aims to improve coordination across
  different agencies so that citizens can engage more easily in trade and commerce. These reforms are
  expected to have a positive impact on employment and incomes generally.

  130. Public financial management reforms aim to improve fiduciary controls and enhance
 quality o f service delivery. By supporting the development o f rules based and transparent budget norms,
 the operation aims to assist the government in addressing the horizontal inequities between rich and poor



                                                       42
provinces on spending on health and education. The operation i s also supporting the government's efforts
at centralizing the Treasury department. This reform will significantly: (i)       reduce fiduciary risks
associated with fragmentation o f government bank accounts across the country; and (ii) ensure that funds
are transferred to service delivery units in a timelier manner. The operation i s also supporting the
publication o f budget execution reports as well as budget plans.

 131.    Several beneficiary-related outcomes o f the undertaken reforms stand out based on the
results o f recent AAA work done by the country team. Overall, economic growth and improvements
in infrastructure and social sphere have benefited the poor the most. Poverty was reduced the most within
the poorest districts. Impact incidence shows that minorities, while s t i l l remaining disadvantaged, have
benefited on average more than other groups. The ongoing studies, including the PSIA, uplands study
and social inclusion work, will further elaborate in this area.

132. The Lao Poverty Assessment (LAOPA), based on household survey data for 2002103 and
completed in 2006, established a strong evidence o f a relationship between poverty and the following
characteristics. It found a strong correlation between poverty and rural infrastructure: the poor are more
likely to live in a village without electricity (45 percent) or a primary school (7 percent). I t also found
that the education o f the household head and spouse are strongly correlated with poverty. For example, in
poor households the share o f heads o f household without any schooling i s 75 percent larger than for the
non-poor. L A O P A also confirmed the poverty reduction benefits o f priority sectors such as basic
education and rural electrification, as i s done in the PRSP. Hence the proposed Operation focuses on:
(a) improving costing and prioritization o f annual work plans by the Ministry o f Education for aligning
more closely education policy and budget allocations; (b) addressing the electricity arrears issues for
improving the financial position o f EDL, and thereby ensuring that the company has fiscal space,
including for expansion o f i t s rural electrification program.

133. A qualitative Poverty and Social Impact Analysis on how the Government's poverty
reduction strategies are translated into implementation at community level was conducted in
FY2008. The PSIA concluded that the government's policy to target poverty reduction efforts on the
poorest districts provides a good basis for a sound, socially inclusive, poverty reduction policy. The study
also found that there was active implementation o f policies to stabilize shifting cultivation, consolidate
villages, and develop focal areas, and that while some people benefited from these policies, others,
including the more vulnerable groups, suffered some negative impacts. However, the evidence and data in
the study were not enough to provide conclusive evidence o f the public or other funds causing these
negative impacts. The PSIA focused on the degree to which they are effective in closing poverty gaps
between ethnic groups, and between men and women. The study looked at the Government's strategy to
focus poverty reduction efforts at the 47 poorest districts where these gaps are also the greatest, and at
how public expenditure allocations have been reformed in response to this strategy and at how it
translates into inclusive actions at the community level. I t was anticipated that a better understanding o f
how this strategy manifested itself in activities on the ground would contribute to information on the
potential social impacts o f policy based lending, and provide recommendations for management o f NT2
revenues, as well as providing information on the nexus o f sectoral strategies and investment projects,
with geographic targeting.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

134.   This operation i s not likely to have significant negative effects on environment, natural
resources, and forestry. Nevertheless, certain environmental impacts might arise since the PRSO series
supports a wide range o f policy areas and interventions. While some PRSO supported actions may have
potential environmental implications (such as SOE restructuring), given that SOE sector i s small, impacts
will be l o w (the program only covers nine enterprises directly, and no massive lay-offs or construction are


                                                     43
envisioned). While trade liberalization may potentially have an impact on the environment, this operation
covers only first steps and regulatory reform aimed directly at easing cross-border movements o f goods,
rather than at major trade reforms. In fact, the investment climate improvement program would not touch
upon environmentally-sensitive sectors, such as forestry or mining since these sectors are regulated by
separate legislation. The impacts therefore are expected to be low or minimal.

135.    PRSO-5 continues to support policy and institutional reform in natural resources
management. Regarding infrastructure, the PRSO program provides support to EDL to implement the
Action Plan for the Financial Sustainability o f the Power Sector. Since the major source o f power comes
from hydropower with potentially high environment and social impacts, the Government i s working
toward ensuring compliance with environmental and social safeguards. Support from international
partners i s available through the N a m Theun 2 Hydroelectric Project, N a m Theun Social and
Environment Project, and the Lao Environment and Social Project. In the context o f NT2, the
Government has enacted the National Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability o f the
Hydropower Sector to ensure that future development o f the hydropower projects complies with
environment and social safeguards.

136.   The PRSO program i s supported by the Poverty and Environment Nexus (PEN) study; the Lao
Environmental and Social (LEnS) project; N T 2 environmental, economic and social work; the Poverty
and Environment Nexus study series and the Lao Environment Monitor. With respect to the relationship
between budgeting and environmental impacts, the 2005/06 Public Expenditure Review had a chapter
devoted to environmental issues.

 137.   The Lao Environmental and Social Project i s supporting the development o f the regulatory
framework for the hydropower sector, and in relation to other large development projects. Sub-grants to
support implementation o f the National Policy on the Environmental and Social Sustainability o f the
Hydropower Sector and the Resettlement Policy have been implemented and their phase Ireports are
ready. Based on the findings and stakeholders dialogues, the Environment and Social Impact Assessment
(ESIA) Practice and Proposed N e w ESIA regulation in Lao PDR has been revised and has been sent to
the Minister for signature. Similarly, the Technical Guidelines on Compensation and Resettlement has
been updated and i s expected to be disseminated in coming months. A sub-grant to develop a river basin
organization to manage water resources in the N a m TheudNam Kading basin, has contributed to the
development o f a national river basin management model, alongside ABD/AFD efforts in the N a m Ngum
basin.

138.    The Nam Them 2 Project remains the primary vehicle for on-the-ground implementation o f
social and environmental safeguards related to hydropower development, and i s providing considerable
practical experience and potential for capacity building in relation to a broad range o f social and
environmental activities, including detailed and long-term village consultations, protected area
management, community forestry, community fisheries, development o f market-based agriculture, and
development o f links between micro-credit schemes and the formal financial sector.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

 139.   The implementation o f the PRSO program i s led by the PRSO Steering Committee. The
Steering Committee has been established by Order o f the Prime Minister, i s chaired by the Minister o f
Finance and supported by a PRSO Secretariat chaired by the Vice Minister o f Finance; both bodies
include senior level representation from relevant ministries. In particular, the Ministry o f Foreign Affairs,
the Ministry for Planning and Investment and i t s National Statistics Center, Ministries o f Education and
Health, Energy and Mining, Industry and Commerce, Agriculture and Forestry, MTCPC, BOL, Prime
Minister's Office and i t s Business Promotion Office, PACSA, and other agencies are represented. The



                                                     44
PRSO Secretariat covers the program implementation and coordinates with all relevant ministries and
agencies.

140. Progress with the PRSO program implementation i s monitored by the PRSO Secretariat
with reference to the PRSO Program Matrix, updated annually as part o f PRSO negotiations.
Accordingly, this Program Document for the second series o f four PRSOs includes a policy reform matrix
designed and updated jointly by the Government, the World Bank and co-financing donors to reflect
evolving policies and the pace of implementation of the NSEDP and the current status of progress. I n
addition to monitoring o f progress against policy actions, there i s close monitoring of macroeconomic
developments, as well as poverty and social indicators.

141. As i s standard practice for PRSOs, the impact of this PRSO series i s evaluated in
accordance with a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework covering all four operations in the
series and established by the Government and IDA at the time of PRSO-5. The end-of-series outcomes
expected under each sub-component o f the PRSO program are recorded in the PRSO matrix (Annex 2).
The baseline indicators for the PFM component are being developed jointly by the Government and
Development Partners in context o f the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
performance measurement framework. I t i s expected that i s report will be prepared by end-2009 and will
have the baseline o f the PFM systems for 2008.

142. The Ministry o f Planning and Investment (MPI) i s leading the preparation o f an action-plan
to strengthen the Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (M&E) for the NSEDP. This framework
however i s not yet strong enough to be fully transferred into the PRSO. Nevertheless, the two monitoring
systems share the majority of the outcome indicators and their sectoral focus i s fully aligned. In
cooperation with the WBI-EG the Bank i s supporting the progress in strengthening the M&E framework
for the NSEDP, by providing capacity building to the MPI, key line ministries, pilot provinces, and to the
National Assembly staff. An essential part of these capacity-building activities includes support for the
sector monitoring plans under the NSEDP. As far as possible, outcome indicators listed in the PRSO
matrix are identical with the outcome indicators o f the NSEDP monitoring plans drafted by the line
ministries, including ministries o f Health and Education.

143. M&E activities are coordinated by the PRSO Steering Committee and Technical
Secretariat, supported by the NSC, with participation o f other development partners. However, the
World Bank and other donors monitor progress via continuous dialogue throughout the year, including
periodic missions. The IMF continues to conduct enhanced supervision, supplementing annual Article I V
missions with mid-year assessments. Regular discussions also take place with the donor community
within the Macroeconomic, Private Sector Development and Trade Working Group as part o f the RTM
process, as well as separate and more detailed discussions on each part of the PRSO in other RTM
working groups. Donors, especially co-financing donors, participate in missions and retreats. The World
Bank drive for joint AAA work has also contributed to consensus building among the donor community
and led to more efficient use o f resources.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

144. The 2005/06 Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (IFA) found that the overall fiduciary risk i s
considered to be high due to weakness in the basic financial management systems o f government
and slow implementationo f the improved public procurement framework. Despite the fact that there
are some built-in controls within the Government's financial management system, there i s s t i l l
insufficient transparency related to public finances, systems of internal control are not functioning
adequately, and reporting systems do not provide accurate or timely information. The Government's
decentralization initiative needs to be supported with a sufficiently robust institutional framework that


                                                   45
clearly defines the new responsibilities at lower levels. The oversight functions and the SA0 need to be
strengthened. The accounting and auditing profession and related institutions need to be developed. To
address these deficiencies, the Government i s actively implementing a program o f reforms under i t s
PFMSP. Progress made under PRSOs 1-4 and planned under PRSOs 5-7 i s contributing to reducing the
fiduciary risk, but this s t i l l remains high. Major recommendations aimed at improving the public
financial management systems, including the efficiency and transparency o f use o f public resources, are
reflected in the PFMSP and supported by the PRSO program. The challenge will be in effectively
implementing the PFMSP, and active monitoring o f the strengthening program initiatives by the
Government i s critical. Strengthening external audit functions and public financial management systems
i s a medium- to long-term process monitored under this series. Implementation o f the legislative
framework for public procurement needs to be improved and immediate priorities are to ensure country-
wide usage o f the recently approved standard procurement documents by all procuring agencies and
strengthening the capacity for monitoring procurement performance and outcomes.

 145.    The last IMF Safeguard Assessment o f the BOL, conducted in 2003, classified the risk as
being medium-high in all five categories on which the assessment was based (external audit mechanism,
legal structure and independence, financial reporting framework, internal audit mechanism and internal
control system). Progress on the safeguard recommendations has been slow, and the agreed joint audit of
the BOL 2003 and 2004 accounts by the State Auditor and an international audit firm have not been done.
The authorities have indicated that they are not in a position to implement this agreement on the audits.

146.    I n view o f the high fiduciary risks, it i s recommended that the Recipient will maintain a
dedicated deposit account for the proceeds o f the Grant, and will report on the funds flow of the
dedicated deposit account. The Government will, if considered necessary by IDA, allow an independent
external audit o f the dedicated foreign currency deposit account.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

 147.   A single tranche grant o f SDR 13.0 million (US$20 million equivalent) will be made available
upon grant effectiveness, anticipated for July 2009. The recipient i s the Lao PDR. The closing date of
the operation will be February 2010.

148. The Grant proceeds will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation o f the
development policy program and the stipulated release conditions o f PRSOd. The grant proceeds
will not be tied to any specific purchases. However, such proceeds will not be used for ineligible
expenditures. As was practice under PRSOs 1-4, the Recipient will maintain a dedicated Deposit
Account in U S dollars at the BOL (which i s the Central Bank o f the Government), as part o f the general
foreign currency reserves o f the Government, and the Grant proceeds will be deposited by IDA into that
Deposit Account. An equivalent amount will be converted into local currency and credited to a Central
Treasury account that i s used to finance budget expenditures.

 149.    Through the MOF, the Government will report to I D A the amount received into the
U S Dollar Deposit Account at the BOL, and the amounts withdrawn from the Deposit Account and
the equivalent amounts credited in local currency to the Central Treasury Account available to finance
budgeted expenditures. The report on the amounts withdrawn will include the date and namehumber o f
the Government's bank account into which the local currency amounts have been deposited. The report
on receipts and disbursements from the Deposit Accounts i s to be submitted to IDA within 45 days o f the
final disbursement o f the grant proceeds from the Deposit Account.

150.  The Government will ensure that the grant proceeds are used for budgeted public
expenditures except for purposes or items on IDA'S "negative list" as agreed during negotiations


                                                   46
and specified in the Financing Agreement. If the proceeds o f the Grant or any part o f the Grant
proceeds are used for ineligible purposes, as defined in the Financing Agreement, the Bank will require
the Government, upon notification from IDA, to refund the amount directly to IDA. Amounts refunded to
IDA upon such requests shall be cancelled. Upon request by IDA, the dedicated account and related fund
flows to and from this account will be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA and in
accordance with terms o f reference acceptable to IDA, and the audit report will be provided to IDA within
four months after IDA'Srequest for such an audit. The processes and controls described above reflect the
findings o f the IMF's safeguard assessment as regards the central bank control environment in making use
o f a dedicated deposit account for the foreign exchange proceeds o f the Bank's disbursement.

R I S K S AND RISK MITIGATION

151.    Many risks highlighted in the first series have not materialized and importance o f the
highest ranked o f these risks has substantially diminished during and because o f the
implementation o f the PRSOs 1-4. In particular, the risks related to commitment to reform and inter-
agency coordination have declined in their probability and importance, while capacity constraints have
increased and became a possible binding constraint. This was due to the extensive dialogue on PRSO
issues and work conducted on improving inter-agency coordination, as well as targeted technical
assistance that has been provided during the previous series of operations. The quality o f macroeconomic
management and commitment to reforms has also improved during the last series, indicating better
capacity and openness.

152.    Nevertheless, the Lao PDR PRSO series remains a high risk program. The potential payoff
- Lao PDR remaining on i t s current growth and poverty reduction trajectory and making progress
towards the MDGs - i s substantial enough to justify this risk. However, significant risk mitigation will
be necessary. Four main risks have been identified which could affect the impact o f the proposed
operation and PRSO program. These are set out below together with mitigating factors:

        The weak public financial management system does not allow for timely reconciliation and
        reporting o f public finances indicates a high fiduciary risk o f possible leakages o f funds. This
        risk i s mitigated by the fact that the Government i s now in the process o f recentralizing budget
        execution at the National Treasury and established the Treasury Single Account, and revenue
        administration functions (Customs and Tax Departments), and the PRSO i s supporting this
        program frontally. Continuing fiscal risks could result in the diversion o f PRSO funds away from
        PRS priorities, and to cover losses o f SOCBs and SOEs. This risk i s partially mitigated by a
        program o f monitoring o f SOE and SOCB performance embedded in PRSO program matrix and
        closer implementation support by Bank staff on PFM issues. To date the PRSOs 1-4 have
        contributed to the following: (i) National Treasury centralization process has already resulted
                                          the
        in the MOF taking control o f provincial government bank accounts; (ii)   deployment o f e-Revenue
        facilities at the Vientiane Capital Tax office; (iii)
                                                            EDL has stopped making losses; and (iv) budget
        monitoring system being strengthened. Therefore, over the course o f the PRSOs 1-4, these risks
        have been reduced. PRSO-5 and beyond are further proposing to mitigate this risk by assisting
        BOL to establish a real time payment settlement system across the country.
        Severe capacity constraints in the civil servicearedue to the lack o f adequate qualified
        personnel, and low pay and incentives. This risk i s partially mitigated by working with the
        Government to outsource non-core functions like ICT connectivity for GFIS, supporting the
        Government in formulating an appropriate pay and compensation policy, and provision of
        additional resources for PRSOs 4-7 implementation through a World Bank project (FMCBP),
        Mining and Energy Sectoral TA, and TA provided by other donors. Consistent with the lessons
        learned from the previous series, the team ensures that TA be available for each sub-component



                                                   47
        and action in the action matrix, and donors work together to identify capacity building needs:
        additional resources made available to PRSO include bilateral aid from Japan, Australia, and EC,
        and aligned TA provided through multi-donor trust funds administered by the World Bank on
        behalf o f other donors. The CAS includes a pillar on capacity building and the World Bank i s
        leading donor efforts in this area.
    (c) Provincial autonomy without adequate monitoring and accountability mechanisms hampers
        implementation o f national policies and an equitable distribution o f resources. This risk i s
        mitigated through a technical assistance on public financial management that focuses on building
        systems for better central-local relations management and increased central control over
        expenditure execution and revenue collection.
    (d) Potential deterioration o r reversal o f the current adjustment measures of the
        macroeconomic situation in the wake o f the global financial crisis may lead to a sharp
        increase in contingent liabilities in the state-owned financial sector, arrears to utility companies
        and private contractors, as well as pressures on expenditures. The PRSO operation and the Lao
        PDR country program mitigate this risk by the following avenues: (i)          through strengthened
        macroeconomic monitoring; (ii) providing direct general budget support to fill in the financing
                                           by
        gap created as a result o f the financial crisis; (iii)
                                                              assisting Government put in place appropriate
        policies and institutional mechanism for improved expenditure and SOEs management;
        (iv) policy actions that limit the level and speed o f accumulation o f arrears to electricity
        company; (v) a financial sector component that includes SOCBs monitoring and strengthens bank
        supervision.

 153.   While these risks will continue to persist, mitigation measures have proven successful in the
past and it i s believed that further reduction in importance o f the P F M and capacity constraints
will be realized. The risks associated with the macroeconomic outlook., such as - on the upside -- shorter
than expected global recession, as well as maintained momentum o f the recent recovery in copper prices;
and - on the downside -- (1) another round o f declines in copper prices, (2) a slower than expected global
recovery that would mean more delays in construction o f the power plants, (3) a reversal o f the currently
planned measures to contain fiscal deficit, quasi-fiscal activities and credit growth may jeopardize
macroeconomic stability, or (4) significant delays in implementation o f the structural reform agendaare
being addressed through in-country measures to mitigate external vulnerabilities stemming from the
outside; the Government i s working on improvement o f i t s fiscal and monetary policy responses and on
exchange rate risks mitigation.

9.        Tlic iiiipact of the on-going global crisis i s being felt in J,ao PDR through i     i
slowdown in ccoiioinic growth, reduction in govci*i1mcnt revenues, lower exports, and
riecliiiiiig foreign direct investtncnt. At the saiiic time, F,ao YI3R will host tlic South East
Asian Games in Decetnber 2009, nticl has undertaken expenditiires towards that end.

 10.         Ttie budget dcficit hi FY2008109 wilt bc tiiglier than previously plantied, due lo
the expected rcvciiiie shortfall following the falling global cnminodity piices (especially
copper), atid the impact o f weaker ccoiiotnic pei.farinaiice on tax receipts and divideiids.
T responsc to the iticraased budgct deficit, the Governmetit has iatroduced revmile
  n
IIICBSIII'~~,   requested increascd donor support, and increased iisc o f domestic fitxincing. If
these Ineasures arc not sufficient to maintain iwmoeeonomiC stability, the Government
will cut dotncstionlly financed capital expenditures, as needed, We recognize that cuts in
tlie priority social sector expenditures could jeopardizc future growth, and T ain tlicrcore
requesting IDA to contribute toward filling the reiiiairiing fiiiaricitig gap by raising its
total fhamcing in PRSO-5 from TJS$lO i d l i o n t o US$20 million.

11.       Tfje tnonetary policy in 2008 took advantage of the stable niacroeconomic
cotitlitions (ittcluding low inflation arid an appreciation of the excliange rak) to stitnulate
doinestic deinand tlwotrgli an iticrcasc in doinestic credit to the economy by 84 peixxtit, In
2003, the Goverritnent is plaritiiiig to significantly slow crcdit growth, as well as intensify
the monitoring o f thc coirtmcrcial hnitks operations, for the sake o f macroeconnmic
stability.

 12.     It1 addition, the Dank o f Laos provided a sltort-term stimulus to the ecouoiiiy in
the for111 of credit to public and private entities for the iiiipleiiientation o f tlie pirblic

          The low-income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) recognizes that better policies and
institutions allow countries to manage higher levels o f debt, and thus the threshold levels for debt indicators are
policy-dependent. In the LIC-DSF, the quality o f a country's policies and institutions i s measured by the World
Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index and classified into three categories: strong,
medium, and weak. Lao P.D.R.'s policies and institutions, as measured by the CPIA, averaged 3.17 percent
over the past three years, placing it in a "weak performer" category. The relevant indicative thresholds for this
category are: 30 percent for the NPV o f debt-to-GDP ratio, 100 percent for the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio,
200 percent for the NPV o f debt-to-revenue ratio, 15 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio, and
25 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. These thresholds are applicable to public and publicly-
guaranteed external debt.

                                         2.        INTRODUCTION
1.     The L I C DSA for Lao P.D.R. indicates that the country continues to face a high risk of
debt distress. The high level o f concessionality o f official borrowing keeps debt service ratios
relatively contained. However, public external debt stock indicators are expected to remain at or
above policy-dependant indicative thresholds throughout half o f the projection period under the
baseline, and could increase further in the event o f weaker macroeconomic performance or greater
accumulation o f nonconcessional debt. The global financial crisis has lowered growth prospects due
to delays in investment projects and softer external demand, and the external position has weakened.38
The fiscal position i s under strain, as are international reserves.

                 3.           BACKGROUND AND ASSUMPTIONS
2.      Lao P.D.R.'s external public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt stock remains
elevated. Strong economic growth, appreciation o f the kip, and favorable external conditions
contributed to a decline in the debt ratio over the past few years-the stock o f external PPG debt in
nominal terms was US$2.9 billion at end-2008, or 53 percent o f GDP, down from 81 percent at end-
2005. Nominal debt stocks also declined as share o f exports o f goods and nonfactor services, from an
estimated 241 percent at end-2005 to around 143 percent currently. The corresponding net present
value (NPV) o f debt at end-2008 was 35 percent o f GDP or 91 percent o f exports. Despite these
improvements, Lao P.D.R.'s debt stock indicators are generally above the policy-based indicative
thresholds (Figure 1). Debt service ratios, however, are below the indicative thresholds, reflecting the
high degree o f concessionality o f existing debt.

3.      Around 69 percent of PPG debt in Lao P.D.R. i s held by multilateral creditors, mainly
the Asian Development Bank (AsDB-39 percent) and International Development Association
(IDA-23   percent). About 29 percent i s held by bilateral creditors-mainly Russia, China, Thailand,
and Japan.39The remaining 2 percent o f PPG external debt comprises external debt incurred by public


38
         Compared to the 2008 DSA, growth projections for 2009-1 1 have been reduced by about 2 percentage
points on average and the primary deficit in the near term i s now projected to be nearly 3 percentage points o f GDP
larger. Long-term growth i s also assumed to be lower (by 0.5 percentage points on average), although foreign direct
investment (FDI) projections have been revised upward based on updated data on resource projects. Debt dynamics
are comparable, but somewhat less benign: debt levels are higher in the near term and decline more slowly.
39
         The Soviet-era debt owed to the Russian Federation i s currently under negotiation. The DSA makes no
assumptions regarding the outcome of the negotiations, maintaining the present value o f the debt at its nominal
value throughout the projection period.

entities on nonconcessional terms and guaranteed by the government, mainly for hydropower
development and electricity generation, including to finance equity stakes. As new emerging market
creditors increase their presence in Lao P.D.R., the government should ensure appropriate
concessionality from these lenders, given its current indebtedness. This further underlines the need for
the authorities to strengthen the capacity in debt management and develop a borrowing strategy to
ensure that new debt i s contracted with a view to maintaining debt sustainability.

                        11 Includes direct borrowing by state-owned enterprises on
                    nonconcessional terms.


4.       The size o f domestic public debt i s currently small, and comprises mainly treasury bills
and bank recapitalization bonds. At end-2008, the stock o f recorded domestic public debt
amounted to 2.1 percent o f GDP. Total public debt, including both domestic and external, stood at
55.2 percent o f GDP. Increasing off-budget public investment by lower levels o f government and
quasi-fiscal operations will lead to a significant increase in the domestic debt this year. Over the
medium term, in the absence o f an increase in external donor assistance and/or fiscal adjustment,
domestic debt i s set to rise substantially. The baseline scenario assumes that sizeable budgetary
deficits over the next few years will put an upward pressure on domestic debt, until fiscal adjustment
leads to a stabilization o f the domestic debt stock at around 8-9 percent o f GDP in the medium and
long term.

5.       The baseline scenario i s based on current policies. I t incorporates the most recent outlook
for global growth in the face o f the ongoing global crisis. In 2009-1 1, growth would remain robust
(averaging 6 percent), supported by large resource projects already under construction as well as the
loose fiscal and credit conditions. Over the medium term, growth accelerates-some resource-related
projects which had been placed on hold enter the construction phase, and structural reforms aimed at
fostering greater private sector participation begin to take hold. As the transition to a market economy
advances, private sector-led growth i s enabled by a restructured and vibrant domestic financial sector
and an improved business climate. External vulnerability i s reduced as large resource sector projects
start generating export receipts (Box 1).

      4.      EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
6.      Under the baseline scenario, public external debt stock indicators remain at elevated
levels over the medium term, declining to the indicative thresholds only toward the middle o f
the projection period (Figure 1 and Table la). The net present value (NPV) o f public external debt
picks up slightly over the medium term before declining steadily to 20 percent o f GDP over the
                                                          77

    longer term. Debt service ratios (both as a share o f exports and government revenues) fall continually
    and remain below indicative thresholds throughout, despite falling concessionality.

    7.       External debt sustainability i s most vulnerable to a depreciation o f the nominal
    exchange rate (Table lb).40In the same way that the sustained strong appreciation o f the kip over the
    past couple of years served to bring the debt ratio down considerably, a 30 percent depreciation of the
    kip would lead to a sharp jump in the NPV o f debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue ratios, which would
    remain above the respective debt stock thresholds through most or all o f the projection period.
    Indicative thresholds (both related to GDP and revenue) would be reached only over the very long
    term. Lower export growth (by one standard deviation in 2010-1 1) would push the NPV o f debt-to-
    exports up to double i t s baseline level over the first half o f the projection period and in excess o f
    indicative thresholds throughout.

    8.        Debt dynamics are considerably worse under an alternative scenario in which key
    variables are at their historical averages. This i s largely driven by the fact that this scenario
    assumes that FDI remains at the historical average (2.7 percent o f GDP), compared to the medium-
    t e r m baseline assumption (8.1 percent o f GDP between 2009-14), implying substantial additional
    debt financing. In case o f a significant decline o f FDI, all debt indicators would rise steadily over the
    projection period and remain more than 50 percentage points above indicative thresholds. However,
    the comparatively optimistic baseline scenario i s justified by the positive structural changes to the
    economy and significant improvements in policy achieved over recent years.

    9.      Lao P.D.R.'s external debt dynamics are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding
    investment and performance o f the resource sector. Large resource-related projects now account for
    some 10 percent o f GDP, with this share expected to nearly double over the medium term. Under the
    baseline, the global crisis i s assumed to delay the near-term investment pipeline by two years, but leave
    unaffected construction o f future planned projects. In addition, profitability i s expected to rebound in the
    medium term as global demand and prices strengthen. Under a less positive scenario, lower growth
    would lead to a deterioration in debt dynamics.

                5.       PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
     10.    Under the baseline, PPG debt i s expected to rise over the medium term reflecting a
    deterioration o f the fiscal position and rising quasi-fiscal liabilities (Figure 2 and Table 2a). In the
    absence o f fiscal' measures, revenue shortfalls-resulting from the global slowdown and the impact of
    the global crisis on mining profits-and higher expenditure (both on- and off-budget) lead to a large
    domestic financing requirement which cannot be met through a drawdown in government deposits.
'
    Domestic debt rises from 2 percent o f GDP in 2008 to around 8-9 percent o f GDP in the medium term
    and stabilizes at that level in the long term. As fiscal adjustment i s pursued over the longer term-in
    part by constraining domestically financed development expenditure in the face o f rising domestic
    debt-PPG debt declines to around 35 percent o f GDP.

    11.     The NPV o f the public debt-to-GDP ratio rises over the medium term before tapering
    off over the remainder o f the projection period. The impact o f the global crisis on growth and

    40
             The most extreme stress test i s defined as the bound test resulting in the most extreme deterioration o f
    the debt burden indicator after 10 years.
                                                78

fiscal revenues drives the near-term debt dynamics. The impact of expiring grace periods and falling
concessionality are offset by assumed fiscal adjustment, leading the NPV o f debt service-to-revenue
lower over the projection period.

12.     Public debt ratios are particularly sensitive to a real kip depreciation over the medium
term (Figure 2 and Table 2b). The impact i s somewhat less over the longer term. A one-time 30
percent real depreciation o f the kip exchange rate would raise the NPV of public debt-to-GDP and
public debt-to-revenue ratios to 58 and 370 percent, respectively. The impact on the debt service-to-
revenue ratio i s relatively mild, leading to an increase to around 22 percent; however, this impact i s
more sustained over the longer term.

13.     Alternative scenarios point to less positive debt dynamics, especially over the longer
term. With key variables at historical averages, the NPV of the public debt-to-GDP ratio remains
elevated over the longer term. Assuming that the primary balance from 2009 i s maintained throughout
the projection period would lead to a severe increase in debt ratios-however, this alternative
scenario i s likely to overstate risks given the sharp deterioration of the primary balance in 2009.


                                   6.      CONCLUSION
14.      While Lao P.D.R. has made progress in reducing its external and public debt burden, it
still faces a high risk o f debt distress. Near-term debt dynamics deteriorate as a result of the global
crisis. Longer-term debt dynamics reflect current and planned large-scale investments in hydropower
and mining projects that will only deliver returns over the medium term. The outlook i s particularly
sensitive to large swings of the exchange rate, highlighting the importance of maintaining
macroeconomic stability and deepening structural reforms.

15.       External borrowing should be obtained on concessional terms and fiscal and quasi-fiscal
liabilities should be carefully managed, to further guard against the vulnerabilities. Continued
prudent debt management as well as cautious assessment and monitoring of large-scale projects will be
required to mitigate the risks posed to external and public debt sustainability. Fiscal risk could arise if
these projects f a i l to generate the expected returns, including to the government's own equity stakes.
Improving, debt management capacity and developing a medium-term borrowing strategy for the
government, including for resource sector activity, as well as greater disclosure of borrowing plans,
would substantially enhance the assessment o f debt sustainability.

   BOX 1: BASELINE SCENARIO-UNDERLYING                                   ASSUMPTIONS (2009-29)
Real GDP growth i s projected to average 6 percent during 2009-1 1 as the global crisis delays new resource
sector-related projects, and falling rural incomes and weak external demand weigh on growth. Support i s
provided by large resource projects already under construction. Over the medium term, growth picks up
(6% percent average) as construction o f new large projects resumes, rising incomes (domestic and foreign)
boost consumption, and nonresource sector growth (mainly from agriculture, light manufactures, and tourism
and other services) picks up. Overall growth i s relatively volatile as resource sector output i s subject to
discrete changes as new projects come online or existing mines are exhausted. Over the longer term, assumed
structural changes and reforms would create an enabling environment, broadening the sources o f growth.
Growth in the resource sector i s expected to level o f f (about 6 percent), while nonresource sector growth
would rise to a sustained level o f about 7.5 percent over the second half o f the projection period. Over time,
the share o f agriculture in GDP declines, as the transition to a market-based economy leads to an increasing
share o f industry and services. Graduation from low-income status could be achieved in the second half of the
projection period.
The external current account deficit i s projected to narrow considerably in the long run. The nonresource
current account would deteriorate over the next decade reflecting the increasing cost o f industrialization,
before moderating over the longer term. This would increasingly be offset by a shift to surplus in the resource
current account as large projects transition from construction to operation phase. The assumed pick up in
nonresource export and services i s driven by strengthened competitiveness and regional integration, supported
by improvements in the investment climate, a streamlining o f business regulations, and meeting trade
commitments. Notwithstanding i t s recent weakening, the overall external position i s expected to strengthen
over time reflecting strong private capital and official inflows, and increasing international reserve
accumulation in the outer years as the resource sector matures and industrialization takes hold. Exports are
highly volatile due to the timing o f production in the mining and electricity sectors, which respond for the
majority o f exports. For example, exports decline by 21 percent in 2009 mainly because o f lower prices for
copper before increasing by 29 percent in 2010 due to the coming online o f Nam Theun 11. Imports in the
resource sector are closely linked to the development o f new resource projects. In the near term, F D I i s in line
with the 2006-08 average as resource sector investments remain robust. Over the long term, resource F D I
declines, while nonresource F D I i s assumed to grow at the same rate as the nonresource economy.
External financing i s assumed to remain largely on concessional terms. Over the long term, grant financing
decreases with economic development.
k Multilateral creditors: Projected loan disbursements in the medium term are relatively low since IDA and
   the AsDB have a pipeline o f operations financed on grant terms. Over the longer term, grant financing
   decreases with economic development, leading once again to a moderate increase in project loans.
k Bilateral creditors: For 2009-10, projected loan disbursements increase as donors provide support to the
   government's development agenda. Over the medium and longer term, greater participation by new
   emerging market creditors leads bilateral finance to take on an increasing role, including for on-lending
   purposes to state-owned enterprises.
k Commercial creditors: Over the medium term, commercial disbursements are relatively small, principally
   used to finance a portion o f the government's equity stake participation in new hydropower projects. This
   includes the planned US$70 million bond issue backed by royalties from the Theun-Hinboun and Houay
   Ho projects. Over time, as development continues and market access increases, commercial borrowing
   takes on a larger role but disbursements remain below those o f official creditors.
Fiscal policy i s expansionary in the near term-the public sector balance i s expected to post a deficit o f nearly
8 percent o f GDP in 2008109 (including off-budget operations), and remain elevated over the next few years.
The nonresource current balance turns negative, implying that resource revenues are used to fund current
expenditures. Under such a scenario, government deposits would quickly be depleted and domestic borrowing
would increase. Financing constraints and the rising domestic debt stock provide an impetus for adjustment-
in addition to a sizable revenue effort, a reduction in domestically financed capital expenditure leads to a
lower deficit in the second half o f the medium term. Over the longer term, vulnerability to resource-related
revenue i s decreased, as shown by a return o f the nonresource current balance to positive territory.
Domestic debt increases over the medium term. Domestic debt i s initially assumed to be composed o f mainly
short-term debt (treasury bills) given the undeveloped nature o f the domestic market for government debt. In
the medium term, the role o f medium- and long-term debt i s assumed to increase, comprising about half of
domestic debt.

Recent Developments and Outlook

 I.     While Lao P.D.R. hus weathered the global crisis well relative to neigbboring
countries, its impact has become evident. Previously strong foreign currency inflows (into
both the current and capital accounts) have slowed. The decline in copper prices together
with tighter global financing conditions has affected the mining sector. lowering export
revenue, depressing financial pert(xmance. and delaying expansion plans. \lew hydropower
investments have also been delayed. In addition, expansionary policies have placed the
external position under strain. Despite the recent appreciation of the kip in real effective
terms. however, the exchange rate is broadly in line with its medium-term equilibrium level.

2.     The fiscal position has deteriorated, with expenditure rising as revenue
performance weakens. On current policies, the fiscal deficit, including olf-budget
operations, is projected to widen from 2.0 percent ofGDP in 2007/08 to 7.8 percent ofGDP
in 2008/09 (the tiscal year ends September 30).

3.      Monetary conditions remain overly accommodative, even relative to the cycle.
Credit growth has stabilized at over 80 percent. including sizeable Bank or Lao P.D.R. (BoL)
direct lending in support of off..budget investment expenditure.

4.       Nonetheless, the ncar-term growth outlook is broadly positive. I:conomic activity
is projected to grow by 4Y2 percent in 2009 supported by projects already in train and public
investment, with modest drag from somewhat weaker tourism and declining rural incomes.
Inflation would remain low and stable. With new large-scale investment projects taking off at
the earl iest in late 20 I 0, growth is expected to increase modestly in 20 I 0 as Naill Theun If
hydropower project comes on stream. with continued softness in other sectors.

5.      Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. On the external n'ollL a weaker
global economic recovery could further depress external demand. Foreign direct investment
in the mining and hydropower sectors could also be adversely aflected. On the domestic
side. the main risk is that excessively expansionary economic policies may jeopardize
macroeconomic stability.

Policy Challenges

6.     An immediate policy priority is to safeguard macroeconomic stability while
supporting growth. In pal1:icular. fiscal and monetary policies need to be tightened to
support exchange rate stability, which will continue to serve as a nominal anchor until
market-based monetary policy instruments can be put in place.

    Reducing the domestic fiscal financing requirement would ease the downward pressure
     011international reserves and avoid undue crowding out of the private sector. This will
     also help address the country's high risk of debt distress. While planned revenue
     measures, such as amend ing the structure of fuel taxes and strengtheni ng customs
     cullection. are a welcome step toward reducing the domestic financing requirement their
     impact is estimated to be lairl)' modest. A reduction in expenditure v,ill also be necessary.
    Off-budget operations should be placed on budget, and BoL fInancing of quasi-fiscal
     operations should be curtailed. More broadly, policy implementation should be aligned
     with institutional mandates.

    A clear signal needs to be sent to commercial banks to rein in credit growth, including
     through a sizeable increase in the required reserve ratio.

7.      Steps should also he taken to strengthen financial sector soundness. The state-
owned commercial banks (SOCB) remain undercapitalized and have weak risk management
capacity-rapid credit growth and a slowing economy point to a possible surge in non-
performing loans and a build lip ofcontingent liabilities. The financial position of SOCBs
should be further strengthencd. and risk management and banking practices guided by
international standards put ill place. BoL oversight capacity should be reinforced, and
conflicts of interests related to SOCBs minimized.

~.      Bold structural reforms are key to achieving sustained growth. Priorities in this
area include improving the investment climate, reducing regulatory uncertainty. and
advancing trade integration.
