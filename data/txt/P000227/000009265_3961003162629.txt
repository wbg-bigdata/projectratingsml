MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDEN"T
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCATION
TO TH  EECU            DIlECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
FOR A SOCL  ACTION PROlECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following meuaorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Burundi for SDR 7.5 million, the equivalent of
US$10.4 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a social
action project.
2.    Backgro. Per capita GNP in Burundi was about $210 in 1990, one of the lowest in
the world. The degree of monetaron of the economy is still low. Since the inception of its
structul adjus_tm  program in 1986, the government of Burundi has made important progress
in improving its macro-economic fiamework and in iteraizing the need for adjustment.
Equaly important, it has increased public spei'ding in health and education, from 26% of the
current budget in 1982 to 36% in 1991. Neverthtless, the combined effects of a high population
growth rate (3.1%) in an already densely inhabited country and inrnal inefficiencies in the
management of these sectors, make it Increasingly difficult to maintain a satisctory level of
delivery of essential services. Because Burundi has one of the lowest urbanization rates in the
world, poverty in Buundi is primarily a rural phenomenon, cha    by high childhood
morbidity and mortality rates, high level of illiteracy Cm line with the sub-Saharan averages),
and a lack of non-farm rura employment opportunities.  Sector  programs in health and
education are not designd to direcdy target those who cannot participate directly in productive
activities nor do they attempt to addrs acute poverty problems. In particular, no comprehensive
program has been implemented to aid women in rural areas who face acute problems because of
lack of access to land, or cohorts of youth who enter the labor force without employment
perspectives.
3.    IDA supports an overaU poverty alleW;ation strateg  which follows a four-pronged
approach: (a) growth, to be fostered by measures being taken under the on-going third
adjustment credit (SAC I) which reinforce the goverament's effbrt to rationalize the
management of public expenditures and encourage private sector initiatives; (b) employment
geneon, through the removal of ecnomic and legal bottlenec, the promotion of micro-
enterprise development, and an emphasis on off-firm employment and labor-intensive public
works programs; (c) improvement in the provision of essential serices to the poor, through
cpacity building, adequate public speqding and increased efficiency, and (d) improved knowledge
and monitoring of poverty. The Social Action Project (BURSAP or in the local language
Twlezimbere) will cut across al four areas and will address structura constaints which gready
hibit induals from realizing their economic potenial (eg. low level of monetaiizatlon, lack
of off-farm productive activities, fagile community capacty). Ihe BURSAP aims more
specificaly at encouraging bottom-up initiatives and involving the poor in productive and social
activities to trigger growth. In support of the goverment's decenalization efforts, BURSAP
would also help local comm ties to improve their management capaci  and to shift more
responsibilits to local authorites In the design of development activities.
4.         Objectves. Within the global goal of poverty alleviation, the primary objectives
of the project are to: (a) encourage a larger participadon of the populadon In small-scale
productive activities (and hence economic growth), as well as to assist beneficiaries through the
provision of basic social services aNi rehabilitation of infrastructure; (b) foster local and non-



-2 -
governmental pardtiipation In the development process; and (c) monitor the county's social
situation as. a means to Improve goveranmt economic and socia policy formulaion and
implementation.
5.      P    Descndoa. The project consists of two components: a poverty alleviation
program, and a monitoring poverty program.
(a)    Rv=  Alleviation. This component aims at supporting poor populations to
participate direcdy in activities conducive to growth and to improve living
standads in selected regons. This component will finance grass-root sub-
projects In the following areas: (O) income generating activities such as training,
start-up equipment, markeedng support, and-on a pilot basis-easier access to
credit; (ii) enhancement of light economic infastructure needed to facilitae
crafsmanship and trade channels for inputs and products (bridges, feeder
roads...); (ii) rehabilitation of basic socil inastructure for essential services
especially in primary education and basic health; and (v) high priority social
actives (flmily planning, literacy programs and food sulemention) with
high externalities. In addition, the development of local NGOs will be
encouraged through advise, training and limited financial support.
(b)    M    onitorp. This component aims to improve the governmens capacity
to implement a global social strategy by allowing an  sessmnt of relatve social
conditions, to improve knowledge of poverty within the country, and to reinforce
the government's ability to incorporate povery and social concerns into its
sectoral and macroeconomic strategies, and to allocate more efficiently minimal
resources to a core program of sena  social services. The project will also
implemeat surveys to follow up the Impact of adjustment measures at both the
household and the sectoral/macroeconomic levels. A targeting system wil be
organized first, followed by the devehpment of a long-term monitoring
mecansm.
6.      I    Eianig. The two components will be financed tbroujh an autonomous agency
which would serve as a mechanism to chanel IDA's and government's fund. Other donors are
likely to contribute through, imtearia, import-generated counterpart funds. The WFP and UNDP
intend to contributechnicaly and operationally.
7.    &roectlW1eldo. The project management will be contacted to wTwtezimbere",
a nonprofit organizaton with whkh the Govermment of Burundi has signed a framework
agreement. The management unit (MU) of Twitezibere is already in place. Sub-projects will
be idendfied and developed by communities and submitted to the MU for appraisal based on
well-defined cteria (imcluded In the Opations Manual which has been finalized). Ihe MU will
select sub-projects and an a c&wor control system will be set up with the partdcipaon of
outsiders to the MU. Implementaton wil be contracted out to NGOs, small scale pfivate sucor
enterpMes, local government and other developmet agencies. Local communities will be closely
associated In the ImplemeItation of the subprojects. A strg follow-p and monitoring system
will be instted, based on a ce   management information system and the use of
benefiaries    _m    The poverty monitoring component wil be funded by the MU and will
be implemented by the Nioal Staiical Institute (ISTEEBU).



8.    Project SustainaiHJl. Beneficiary contribution (in cash, material or labor) will be a
prerequisite for any sub-project to be considered for financing under the poverty alleviation
component.  In addition, participation of communities in designing, implementing, and
maintaiing sub-projects will also be required. Strengthening local NGOs who are involved in
many of these projects will also improve sustainability of sub-projects. Regarding the
sustainabiity of the Twitezimbere istinttion itself, the mid-term review will determ;ne the
desirability of its sustainability in light of its implementation record. For this reason, incremental
operating expenditures are not financed on a declining basis. Should the project be successful
in efficiently implementing micro-projects which have a good record of improving the living
standards of the populstion, past experience with Social Funds has shown that It should have no
problem in raising the money from extsrnal donors, organizations, and the government to cover
these expenditures. The poverty monitoring component of the project contains a strong capacity
building element and significant traning which will allow long-term effects.
9.    Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. The PCR for the First and Second
Strucural Adjustment Credits pointed out weak micro and sectoral linkages as one of the reasons
for the mitigated performance of the adjustment program. These operations did not include any
measures aiming directly at promoting community participation in rj;al areas. Past and ongoing
projects in social sectors (education and health) show that community participation in basic
infrastructure (schools and health centers) is critical, but delicate to achieve in the absence of a
bottom-up approach. The project will rely on intermediary agencies-irrespective of their
institutional settings-with strong local interest to implement projects. Earlier involvement in
poverty areas was hindered by lack of reliable statistics, a drawback to be addressed by the
second component of the proposed project. The design of the project draws from lessons learned
from other projects in the region (i.e., the Zambia Social Recovery Projedt) or elsewhere (i.e.,
the Bolivia Emergency Sotial Fund -PPAR no. 8449).
10.   Rationale for TDA          . The project is an integral part of the counrSy strategy
presented to the Board in June 1992 which supports achieving sustained economic growth while
reducing poverty and increasing the access of the poor to basic social services. In addition to
being an essential element of the poverty alleviation strategy, the project is a key complement of
the reform program undertaken under the Third Structral Adjustment Credit. IDA's
involvement is also justified because IDA can play a unique catalytic function and help mobilize
other donors' resources into these poverty alleviation efforts in a coherent framework. Finally,
the project will be an opportunity for IDA to enhance both government decentralization efforts
and NGOs' capacity to participate in local development activities.
11. Agre Actions. Agreement has been reached on the following: (a) management of the
project will be undertaken by an autonomous institutional stucture and staffing independent from
the adminitraion (three staff, including the MU director have been already recruited after a
highly selective screening); (b) an Operational Manual will detail a set of clear procedures for
project implementation and precise criteria to evaluate and select sub-projects, as well as
mehanisms to assure strong involvement of beneficiaries in sub-project identificadon and of
NGOs and decentralized agencies in project execution and supervision; (c) audit wiUl be
undertaken three times a year during the first year of project implementation and twice a year
thereafter - one audit per year wil also include a technical as well as financial audit; (d) annual
replenishments of the project account will be programmed into the PEP; (e) any change to the
statute of the implementing agency, the Agreement between i * implementing agency and the
govenment, or to the Operational Mamua will require approval by IDA; and (t) the
implementing agency will be staffed at all dmes by competent persomnnel with terms of reference,



experience, and qualiflcations acceptable to IDA. Conditions of credit effectiveness include: (P)
the MU has selected 25 sub-projects for finacing and IDA has approved the selection of at least
10 of those sub-projects; (i) the Project Account has been opened  d t  Iitil Deposit of
US$100,000 has been dted by the Borrower; ad (ii) a MIS aceptable to IDA has been
installed In the MU and Is operational.
12.   E                      Environmeentl category is B. Enironmly beneficial
sub-projects wil be weighted positively by the MU and sub-projects with potentia
effects will have to comply with the fotthcoming ewnironen  framework being developed under
the National Environment Straeg.
13.   Progam Obetive Qorj. The project wold coribute to the Bank Program
Objective of poverty reduction through: 0) employment creato and income generatin in
private, small scale actvities; (ii) enhanced access to basic social Infastrucure (educadon and
health) and essental social servic  (iteracy, family planning and nuitonal status); and (c)
improved poverty monitoring.
14.   Benehts. The main benefits will be to improve the living coons of selected
categories of poor and vulnerable (especy women and youth) through higher productivty,
enhanced access to essent  socia infstructure and poteniay mcreased employmet
opportunitie. The communities where target groups live wil beft both from the products of
the work pe,-.ormed and from better education, health and sanitation serices, and other collecdve
goods to the production of which they wfll be associated. Ihe project wiUl also provide an
opportunity for existng loWal NGOs to expand, and for new ones to be cread. Finally, thrugh
its survey component, the project will alow the govenmen to improve its knowledge of poverty
and thus its frmulation of both social and maconmic policy.
15.   Ridk. Main risks associated with the social action program componet of the project
relate to the low management caacity of local NGOs, and to the lack of entrpneuria
experience of the target populations, which could lead to inefficient and low project
mpolementation. To avert these risks, objective and carefully designed sets of sub-project
selecion criteria have been defined. Additionally, an emphasis will be put on basic training for
beneficiaries and execudng agencies and tecal assitance will be provided for sub-project
appraisal. Strong sub-project suapevision, a tanparent magement iono n system, and
random auditng of accounts will enhanc management efficiency. Pcuement mechaisms wil
be similar to those successfuly used under eistin projects such as the European Community
micro-realization project. Local NGOs wil be assisted by expedenced intrin  NGOs, so
as to upgrade their still low ppr    and managg capacites. The risk that some parts of the
poverty monitorg component be too difficult a task for STEEBU will be reduced through
capacity building of dtis instfttion and a mid-term  of the progam. The risk that fte
govement will atempt to limit the autonomy of the MU has been addressed through the
insttutional setp agreed upon befbre negotain.

NOTE ON PROJECTS W1TH SIGNIFICANT DISBURSEMfENT LAGS
1.    Of 15 curently active projects in Burundi, four have disbursement lags above 50 percent. They
are distributed in the (1) financial and telecommunications sectors; and (2) the agricultural sector. The
slow pace of policy reform, poor project management and procurement difficulties are factors contributing
to slow disbursements. The following are the specific reasons affecting disbursements on the four projects
with the greatest lags:
(a)    Agricultural Services Sector Credit (2024-BU): Delays in effectiveness, slow recruitment
of project technical assistance, complexity of the institutional setup of the project, slow
implementation of the coopeative development component contributed to slow
disbursement. Implementation issues are being addressed by the recruitment and training
of local consultants and the redesign of the cooperative component.
(b)   MuyngaAgriculturalDelopment Credit (1857-BU): The geographical isolation of the
project site has aggravated the recruitment and maintenance of qualified financial staff.
In addition, the disbursement on works has been delayed by the difficulty to attract
contractors to this part of the country. Disbursements are picking up.
(c)    Small Eneiprise/APEX Credi (1889-BU): Disbursement was slow at the beginning of
the project due to the delay in credit effectiveness and low ceilings for eligible
investments which excluded a significant segment of the market. Commitments have
since accelerated significantly following revision of the sub-project eligibility criteria and
increased Interest from investors and participating financial intmediaries.
(d)    Telecmmuncadons II (1805-BU): Major delays in procurement and an initial inadequate
design have greatly hampered disbursements on this project.
2.    To improve disbursements and implementation of projects, the resident mission has been
reinforced through the recruitment of a long term local consultant. A country Implementation review was
carried out in March 1993. A steady improvement in Burundi's absorptive capacity is expected as the
result of reforms undertaken under the adjustment program and greater familiarization of project
managers with the Bank's procedures.
