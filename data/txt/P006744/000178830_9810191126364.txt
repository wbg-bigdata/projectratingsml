SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises an agricultural credit project for which a
Bank loan of US$64.0 million equivalent is proposed. The loan would support
a three-year lending program for medium- and long-term investments in agricul-
ture (including livestock) by small-, medium- and large-scale commercial
farmers and machinery contractors and in related agro-industries.
ii.       The agricultural sector in 1975 contributed about 27% of the Colombian
Gross Domestic Product and about 59% of the value of all exports of goods and
services. From 1971 to 1975, agricultural output grew on average 4.6% per
annum in real terms. This is well above the historical average and is prin-
cipally a result of substantially increased production of crops other than
coffee, although the livestock sub-sector has also increased its output,
mainly through a 3 to 4% annual expansion of the national herd. With the
exception of wheat, oilseeds and cocoa, Colombia is self-sufficient in food
production in terms of quantity, but, although the volume of food production
over the past decade has kept pace with population growth, there has been
little, if any, improvement in dietary standards. Production could be substan-
tially increased by practicing more intensive farming in the highlands and by
bringing into production unused areas in the lowlands. The territory east of
the Andes, which represents 57% of the total land area of Colombia, is in-
habited by only 3% of the total population. Within the 1.2 million existing
farms of Colombia, about 7.7 million ha is used for crop production. In
addition, there are some 17.5 million ha of grassland and 5.9 million ha of
unused land on the 1.2 million farms. The rural population of 9 million
constitutes about 37% of the total population, and the economically active
population in the rural areas is also about 37% of the total economically
active population.
iii.      Although unemployment in rural areas is still high, the rural employ-
ment situation appears to have improved in recent years, particularly in the
season of peak labor needs. Average annual income per capita in 1974 was
estimated to be about US$260 in the rural areas and US$525 in the urban areas.
However, in 1975 about 63% of the rural population lived below the poverty
income level as defined by the Bank (US$148 per capita in 1975) including
almost all farmers with less than 20 ha.
iv.       The Government has formulated a long-term development strategy in
which key elements are the expansion of agricultural output, the raising of
nutritional standards and the improvement of income distribution, thereby
raising the living standards of the poorest segment of the community. A vital
component of the National Food and Nutrition Plan, which has high priority in



- ii -
Government policy, is an increase in production of carbohydrate and protein-
rich foods, such as maize, wheat, soybeans and milk. Attention is also being
focused on the possibilities of manufacturing formulated and fortified foods
using locally produced inputs. This proposed Second Agricultural Credit Loan
and a proposed loan for a rural development project would both contribute to
attaining these objectives.
v.        The Bank has made eight loans for agricultural development in
Colombia since 1966 totalling US$114.6 million. These loans, of which five
were smallholder oriented, have been restricted to specific subsectors or
geographical areas. Credit has been channeled through the Colombian Institute
for Agrarian Reform (INCORA), the Banco Ganadero (BG), and the Caja de Credito
Agrario, Industrial y Minero (CAJA AGRARIA).
vi.       The proposed Second Agricultural Credit Project would be production
oriented and would be in line with the Government's development strategy in
that, by financing investments for crop and livestock production and for
related agro-industries, it would help strengthen the Government's efforts to
raise the total output and employment levels of the agricultural sector. It
would also help narrow the income disparities between urban and rural areas
by providing employment for rural labor and by increasing the incomes of the
small commercial farmers. Small commercial farmers are defined as those
having gross assets not exceeding the equivalent of US$25,000, including land,
the greater part of which is invested in farming activities, and who derive at
least 75% of their income from farming. The project would contribute to the
implementation of the National Food and Nutrition Plan by increasing the pro-
duction of carbohydrate and protein-rich foodstuffs. The proposed Integrated
Rural Development Project would focus on the economic and social development
of subsistence farmers who are currently mainly outside the market economy,
and another project is under preparation which would set out to improve
nutritional standards and family health.
vii.      Total Project cost would be about US$174.1 million equivalent which
would be financed as follows: (a) the Bank loan of US$64.0 million, or 37% of
total Project costs, would finance all the foreign exchange costs; (b) the
Banco de la Republica (BOR) and participating agencies would contribute
US$73.8 million, or 42% of Project cost; and (d) sub-borrowers would finance
US$36.3 million, or 21% of Project cost.
viii.     The proposed Project would be country-wide and sector-wide in scope
(except for coffee production and fisheries). BOR would be responsible for
overall administration of the Project and would channel credit to sub-borrowers
via participating agencies (PAs). A PA could be any financial institution
entitled to BOR's rediscount facilities. BOR would be responsible for ensuring
that Project investments are technically, financially and economically sound.
To discharge this responsibility, BOR would require PAs to enter into subsi-
diary loan agreements under which they would undertake to provide complementary
working capital requirements of sub-borrowers and qualified technical staff to
evaluate subloan applications and ensure the provision of adequate technical
assistance to sub-borrowers. In addition, BOR would carry out random checks
of subloan investments.



- iii -
ix.       The basic interest rate for farmers would be not less than 15% per
annum, with compulsory charges and fees this would be equivalent to an
effective cost of credit of between 17% and 19% per annum. In addition, all
farm sub-borrowers, except the smiall commercial farmers, would be required to
expend annually on private technical assistance the equivalent of aL least 2%
of the outstanding balance of subloans. For agro-industries the interest
rates would be between 18% and 26% per annum depending upon the locality and.
size of the investment being financed. BOR would rediscount not less than 37%
of subloans made by PAs to farmers and machinery contractors and not less than
60% of subloans for agro-industrial enterprises. Rediscount rates would be
not more than 13% per annum for subloans to farmers and machinery contractors,
and for agro-industry subloans rediscount rates would be between 14% and 23%
per annum depending upon the locality and size of the investment being financed.
x.         Since the items to be financed by subloans are varied and scattered
over a wide geographic area, they would not be suitable for international com-
petitive bidding. Therefore, local trade channels would be used. There are
many suppliers of the required inputs in Colombia, competition is keen among
them and repair and service facilities are widespread and adequate. At least
three bids would be required, however, whenever the cost of machinery and
equipment for agro-industries in a single investment exceeds US$150,000.
xi.       Estimated financial rates of return would range from 16% to 40%, and
the overall economic rate of return would be 28%.
xii.      During negotiations appropriate assurances were obtained that pro-
vide a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$64.0 million for a term of 15
years, including a 3-1/2-year grace period. The borrower would be BOR, which
would assume the foreign exchange risk.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Colombia has requested a Bank loan to help finance
a three-year lending program for medium- and long-term investments in agricul-
ture (including livestock) by small-, medium- and large-scale commercial
farmers and machinery contractors and in related agro-industries. The Bank
loan would be to BOR with the guarantee of the Republic of Colombia for the
equivalent of US$64.0 million. The proceeds of the loan would be relent by
BOR to both public and private financial intermediaries for the purposes
requested. The Bank has made eight loans for agricultural development in
Colombia since 1966 totalling US$114.6 million of which five were smallholder
oriented.
1.02      The proposed Second Agricultural Credit Project was prepared by
various official entities in Colombia under the guidance and coordination of
BOR and with the assistance of a Bank/FAO Cooperative Program mission which
visited the country in November/December 1974.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Agricultural Sector
2.01      Out of a total estimated population of about 24.5 million in 1976,
nearly nine million, or 37%, live in rural areas. Some 85% of rural families
are exclusively involved in farming. Migration to urban areas has been con-
siderable and the rural population has been increasing only by 0.5% per year
between 1964 and 1973, as compared with 2.8% for total population and 4.7% for
urban areas. The agricultural sector supports 37% of a total labor force of
about seven million and, in 1975, contributed 27% of GDP and 59% of the value
of all exports of goods and services. With the exception of wheat, cocoa,
oilseeds, pulses and barley, Colombia is self-sufficient in food. In 1975,
following considerable Government efforts at diversification, coffee, grown
in the Andes by small- and medium-scale farmers, provided about 62% of
earnings from agricultural exports and about 44% of total merchandise export
value. Other main export crops are sugar, cotton, rice and bananas (Annex 1).
2.02      From 1971 to 1975, agricultural output grew on an average of 4.6%
in real terms. However, this good overall performance conceals important
differences between rural areas. Most of the rural population live in



- 2 -
conditions of poverty, where unemployment and under-employment are serious
problems. The main reasons for this situation are:
(a) poor distribution of land, associated with a high concentration
of small farmers on the poor and deteriorating soils of the
Andean mountains;
(b) the lack of coordinated production support services (research,
extension, credit and marketing) adapted to their production
systems and socio-economic condition; and
(c) the inadequate physical infrastructure (roads and electricity)
and social services (education and health).
Land Tenure and Type of Farming
2.03      An exceptional regional diversity in altitudes (from sea level to
5,800 m), soils and climates (from tropical to alpine) enables Colombia to
produce a wide range of agricultural commodities. Out of a total area of 114
million ha, the agricultural census of 1970/71 showed that only 31 million
ha were occupied by the existing 1.2 million farm units--7.7 million ha were
cropped (2.1 million ha in seasonal crops, 2.3 million ha in permanent crops
and 3.3 million ha in fallow); 17.5 million ha were in grassland; and 5.9
million ha were unused.
2.04      There are six main types of farming in Colombia:
(a) large-scale extensive ranching on the lowlands of the Caribbean
and Andean valleys; 80% of the 22.5 million head of cattle in
1974 were found in those regions;
(b) medium- and large-scale mechanized farming in the inter-Andean
valleys, which has been expanding steadily and which mainly
produces cotton, soybeans, oil palm, rice and sugarcane;
(c) small- and medium-scale farming at intermediate altitudes in
the highlands, with coffee as the main cash crop;
(d)  organized resettlements of small farmers on land acquired and
reclaimed by the Government, mainly in the Caribbean lowlands
but also in the Amazon basin;
(e) spontaneous colonization of up to 1 million ha a year in the
areas of tropical rainforest and in the Eastern Plains; and
(f) high altitude, small-scale farming (less than 20 ha) in the
Andean highlands. In such densely populated areas, the
average farm size is 4 ha. These farms are often on poor
soil and steep slopes and produce mostly for family sub-
sistence, although surpluses are marketed. Production



- 3 -
diversification is a hedge against risk, and farming
system characteristics are essentially low input, low risk,
and low output. Overgrazing and cropping steep slopes
without soil conservation practices have resulted in
substantial erosion. Insufficient technical assistance
and lack of access to institutional credit and to markets
are among the major obstacles to improvement.
Land Distribution and Income Structure
2.05      The 1970/71 agricultural census showed that the largest 8% of farms
(50 ha and above) accounted for 80% of the total farmland, while 60% of all
farms occupied only 4% of all farmland in small holdings with less than 5 ha,
of which 270,000 units had less than 1 ha.  Some 83% of all farmers had less
than 20 ha and operated only 13% of the farmland.  In addition, 200,000 rural
families, dependent on agriculture, were landless.  The distribution of rural
income is consequently very skewed, with half going to 10% of the rural popu-
lation. In 1975, 63% of the rural population had incomes below the poverty
income level as defined by the Bank (US$148 per capita for 1975), including
almost all farmers with less than 20 ha.
2.06      Rural unemployment and underemployment are high, estimated at an
average of 20% of total available labor. Nevertheless, the situation appears
to have improved in recent years, particularly in the season of peak labor
needs. Migration to cities is significant especially from the populated
highlands where the labor force is decreasing.
2.07      Since 1961, the Instituto Colombiano de la Reforma Agraria
(Colombian Institute for Agrarian Reform - INCORA) has been involved in pro-
grams of distribution of public land (4.1 million ha up to the end of 1974)
and redistribution of private land (0.4 million ha) associated, to varying
degrees, with investments in land reclamation and infrastructure and the
provision of supervised credit and technical assistance. However, accom-
plishments have been limited in view of the magnitude of the task. Most of
the land distributed so far has been assigned to families already occupying
the land. INCORA's land titling activities are limited mostly to distributing
to small-scale farmers titles on public land in colonization areas.
Agro-industries
2.08      The facilities for processing and storage of crop and animal products
have not improved as fast as the expansion of production from the commercial
segment of the agricultural sector. Processing of agricultural products
traditionally has been concentrated in sugarcane processing plants, cotton
ginneries, rice and wheat mills, oil extraction plants and a few other indus-
tries such as milk, vegetable and fruit processing plants. Considerable
additional investment is required to expand and modernize existing agro-
industries and to establish new facilities in areas in which production is
expected to increase.



-4-
Government Policy
2.09      The Government's principal objectives in the agricultural sector
are (i) to increase agricultural production as rapidly as possible; (ii) to
raise nutritional standards; and (iii) to improve income distribution. The
main strategies for achieving these objectives are contained in the National
Food and Nutrition Plan prepared by the Colombian administration, which
assumed office in August 1974. This Plan identifies the following five main
components for the stimulation of food production and for raising the income
of the rural poor;
(a) investments in research and the adaptation of new varieties
for production on small farms;
(b) an integrated rural development program;
(c) a national agricultural credit program in which high priority
is to be given to the production of cereals, legumes, starch
crops, and animal products;
(d) investment in agro-industries; and
(e) investment in the development and marketing of fishery
products.
The investments envisaged under the proposed Project form part of items (c)
and (d) of this Plan, and, consequently, would help the Government to achieve
its objectives. The proposed Integrated Rural Development Project would
include parts of items (a) and (b) of the Plan.
2.10      The modern agricultural sector receives Government attention in two
important respects--as the main source of foreign exchange earnings and as a
source of foodstuffs not produced by the traditional sector but essential to
the implementation of the National Food and Nutrition Plan. Additional credit
resources and export incentives will be directed at products in which Colombia
is believed to have a comparative advantage (particularly livestock products,
cotton, rice, sugar, bananas, tobacco and flowers) on international markets.
Institutions and Technical Assistance
2.11      The Institute of Colombian Agriculture (ICA) and the Institute for
Renewable Natural Resources and the Environment (INDERENA) are responsible for
research, quality control and technological development in the sector. In
addition they train extension agents and check the quality of advice provided
by private consultants. ICA also has a special responsibility for advisory
services for farmers with less than 10 ha. The Institute for Agricultural
Marketing (IDEMA) is charged with stabilizing prices and ensuring adequate
supplies of agricultural products by storage and importation. Each of the
institutions has experienced serious financial and managerial problems,



but the difficulties have been recognized by the Government, which is com-
mitted to strengthening these key entities in the agricultural sector.
The financial condition of ICA has been improved by instituting charges
for many of its services while the activities of IDEMA have been brought
more closely into line with its financial capacity.
2.12      Associations of producers have formed important institutions in
Colombia and have assumed many of the functions undertaken by public agencies
elsewhere. In addition, banks also have technical staff for credit evaluation
and supervision and the provision of technical assistance. The private sector
has about 1,000 professionals and 700 assistants engaged in advisory work,
while the public sector has about 900 professionals and 1,500 assistants con-
cerned exclusively with technical assistance.
B. Banking and Credit
2.13      Monetary and banking policy is determined by the Monetary Board
(MB), chaired by the Minister of Finance and Public Credit, which regulates
loans and deposits, compulsory investment, and rediscounting., The Minister
of Agriculture and the General Mlanager of BOR are members of MB (Annex 2).
2.14      The policies of MB are implemented by BOR, which, in addition to
performing the functions of a Central Bank, administers the special funds
which have been established by the Government, with both internal and external
resources, to channel credit to specific sectors according to Government prior-
ities. Of particular importance to the agricultural and agro-industry sectors
are Fondo Financiero Agropecuario (FFAP), Fondo para Inversiones Privadas (FIP),
and Fondo Financiero Industrial (FFI). The FFAP is managed by BOR's Agricul-
tural Credit Department, while FIP and FFI are managed by the Development
Credit Department.
2.15      The major financial intermediaries in the private sector are 21
commercial banks and 15 development finance companies, the latter specializing
in medium- and long-term loans and equity financing. In the public sector,
Banco Popular (BP) and its subsidiary, the Corporacion Financiera Popular
(CFP), specialize in financing for small- and medium-scale industry; and the
Banco Central Hipotecario (BCH) is engaged in housing finance. There are also
institutions of mixed ownership: the Caja de Credito Agrario, Industrial y
Minero (CAJA AGRARIA) which provides the largest share of the country's total
credit for crop and livestock production; the Corporacion Financiera de
Fomento Agropecuario y Exportaciones (COFIAGRO), which finances agricultural
development, processing and exports; Banco Ganadero (BG), which is engaged
principally in livestock finance, and the Banco Cafetero (BC). Although not a
bank, INCORA has in recent years been a significant agent in channeling credit
to agriculture, particularly to small farmers.



-6-
2.16      Institutional credit (including INCORA's) to the agricultural sector
in 1974 totalled US$400 million and the credit outstanding to the sector at
the end of 1974 was about US$500 million. This agricultural credit portfolio
was shared by CAJA AGRARIA, 39%; commercial banks, 37%; BG, 5%; INCORA, 9%;
and others, 10%. Total loan commitments to the agricultural sector from
various sources rose to US$491 million in 1975.
2.17      With the object of directing substantially larger credit resources
to the agricultural sector, the Colombian Congress, in 1973, enacted Ley
Quinta (Law 5) under which banks (except CAJA AGRARIA, BG and BC) are required
to invest an amount equivalent to a variable percentage of their portfolios
(regulated by MB and currently 17%) in agricultural bonds issued by BOR which
carry 8% per annum interest. Funds raised through this compulsory system are
used to finance the FFAP from which banks, including those exempted from com-
pulsory bond purchase, are permitted to rediscount loans made to the agricul-
tural sector. In 1974, FFAP approved 23,000 rediscounts, amounting to US$213
of which US$80 million was for medium- and long-term credit. In 1975 the
total credit financed by FFAP dropped slightly to US$202 million, while during
the first nine months of 1976 FFAP provided about US$169 million. Some two-
thirds of the resources are used for short-term credit and one-third for
refinancing medium- and long-term loans in the sector.
2.18      Interest rates for agriculture range from 14% to 30% per annum al-
though there are only limited funds available at lower rates and only to small-
scale subsistence farmers; the latter funds are provided by CAJA AGRARIA and
INCORA. During 1974, MB issued regulations which simplified rates payable for
rediscounts from FFAP and the rates chargeable to sub-borrowers for most loans.
Currently, the basic FFAP interest rate through official and commercial banks
is 15% per annum payable quarterly. Interest is collected at the beginning of
each quarter, unless the term of the loan includes a grace period, in which
case it is collected at the end of each quarter throughout the term of the
loan. Development finance companies are permitted to charge up to 20% interest,
including all commissions and charges for studies. On all agricultural loans,
individual borrowers are required to pay an annual amount equivalent to 1% of
their outstanding loan balance for life insurance while large agricultural
borrowers (assets, including land, in excess of Col$ 500,000) have to pay a
levy of 1% per annum on their outstanding loan balance towards a national
small farmer technical assistance fund. The current FFAP rates and rediscount
margins are as follows:

Individual borrowers using FFAP funds channeled through official or commercial
banks are effectively charged the following annual rates for medium- or long-
term loans with grace periods which may range from 1-1/2 to 4 years, according
to the characteristics of the investments. No grace periods are allowed for
investments in farm machinery, floriculture for the export market, the develop-
ment of farm water supplies or labor housing; thus, for these categories the
effective interest rate is slightly higher as the interest is collected
quarterly in advance. The effective cost of credit is therefore as follows:

In addition, borrowers with gross assets over Col$ 500,000 are required to
contract private technical assistance, the cost of which is generally no less
than the equivalent of 2% of the outstanding balance of the loans financed by
FFAP.
2.19      The rates charged by CAJA AGRARIA since May 1976 for loans financed
from its own resources range from 14% to 18% per annum. Prior to that date
the rate did not exceed 15%. Borrowers are almost invariably required to pay
an annual amount equivalent to 1% of their outstanding loan balance for life
insurance. Since the CAJA AGRARIA requires prepayment of interest charges,
except in rural development project areas, its effective interest rates for
most farmers with total assets over Col$ 100,000 (US$3,333 equivalent) are
between 21% and 23% per annum, the lower rate applying to most loans under
Col$ 150,000.
C. Previous Agricultural Credit Projects
2.20      Since 1966, the Bank has made eight loans for agricultural develop-
ment in Colombia, totalling US$114.6 million. These loans have been limited
either to specific sub-sectors or to defined geographic areas. Out of the
eight, only two had no credit components--Loan 502-CO for Atlantico 3
Irrigation Project and Loan 849-CO for the Second Atlantico Development
Project (Annex 3).
2.21      The six projects that did include financing for on-farm investments
were the Livestock Development Project (Loan 448-CO) for US$16.7 million;
Second Livestock Development Project (Loan 651-CO) for US$18.3 million; Agri-
cultural Credit Project (Loan 624-CO) for US$17 million; Caqueta Land Coloni-
zation Project - Phase I (Loan 739-CO) for US$8.1 million; Caqueta Rural
Settlement Project - Phase II (Loan 1118-CO) for US$19.5 million; and Cordoba
2 Agricultural Development Project (Loan 1163-CO) for US$21.0 million. In
five projects, credit has been channeled through CAJA AGRARIA for livestock
and INCORA for land development and settlement.



- 9 -
2.22      Under Loan 448-CO, appraisal estimates called for 1,175 subloans to
farmers, 890 of which were expected to go for beef production, 250 for milk
production and 35 for sheep. A total of 1,100 subloans were actually made,
with 880 going for beef, eight for sheep, and the rest for dairy. In January
1972, US$3.3 million of the loan was cancelled because of a failure to resolve
outstanding issues stemming mainly from inadequate Government support, which,
in turn, was partly due to the limited geographic coverage of the Project.
2.23      The Second Livestock Development Project (Loan 651-CO) was completed
on time with final disbursement on June 6, 1975. At its outset in 1970/71,
the Project suffered from managerial, technical and economic problems, but,
following changes introduced in 1972 and with better market conditions, it
then progressed well. A total of 1,601 development subloans were made--1,239
for beef production and 362 for dairy production--which was 68% more than the
950 expected at appraisal because, as the Project advanced, higher priority
was given to smaller enterprises. The Project has been successful in building
up the capacity of the lending institution, CAJA AGRARIA, to handle loans for
medium- and long-term livestock development. The audit report of the Opera-
tions Evaluation Department (OED) on the Second Livestock Project was taken
into consideration in finalizing the proposed Second Agricultural Credit
Project.
2.24      Under Loan 624-CO, disbursements after three years of effectiveness
were only US$2 million, but, when INCORA and the Government increased their
support of the project and some modifications were made to the project itself,
such as enlarging the project area and allowing participation by farmers with
less than 10 ha, activity speeded up and the remaining US$14 million was dis-
bursed in 18 months. At appraisal, it was estimated that about 2,500 farmers
would participate. The actual number was 3,500. A draft OED audit report on
this Project drew attention to the special problems associated with financing
incremental short-term credit from a Bank loan, and emphasized the need for
a project monitoring system. The proposed Second Agricultural Credit Project
does not include the financing of short-term credit, but does include a require-
ment for a monitoring system (para 3.26).
2.25      Project objectives under Loan 739-CO were dropped 70% as a result of
cost increases and problems in implementation. Revised goals in the US$3.7
million farm credit program were 1,600 subloans for breeding cattle and 270
for fattening cattle. Actually, 1,887 subloans have been made for breeding
cattle and 141 for fattening cattle. The closing date was extended from
April 30, 1975 to June 30, 1976, by which time all project components had been
completed, including the construction of 200 km of roads, six health centers,
and 60 schools. The loan has now been fully disbursed. Loan 1118--CO is a
continuation of the Caqueta colonization project and about 2,850 small farmers
are expected to receive sub-loans from the US$7.3 million allocated for farm
credit. Loan 1163-CO includes medium- and long-term credit to small farmers
for on-farm development of 20,000 ha, and purchase of machinery and livestock.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Brief Descriptionr
3.01      The Project would s,pport a three-year lending program to help
finance on-farm investment and agro-industries. The Project would be pro-
duction oriented and would be in line with the Government's development
strategy in that, by financing investments for crop and livestock production
by commercial farmers and for related agro-industries, it would help strength-
en the Government's efforts to raise the productivity and employment capacity
of the agricultural sector.
3.02      The objectives of the Project would be to:
(a)  expand food production to enable Colombia to continue meeting
nearly all her domestic food requirements from local resources,
and, particularly, to increase the domestic sup;> y of carbo-
hydrate and protein-rich foods in support of the Governiment's
efforts to improve dietary standards through the National Food
and Nutrition Plan;
(b)  increase the availability of inputs for industry from the
agricultural sector;
(c) continue agriculture's substan.tial contribution to the
balance of payments; and
(d)  increase employment opportunities, particularly in rural
areas, by creating jobs on farms and in agro-industries.
3.03      Under the Project US$14 million would be reserved out of the proposed
Bank loan for small commercial farmers (as derfined in para 3.29) who would be
entitled to borrow a higher proportion (85%) of investment costs than would be
permitted for other sub-borrowers (75%).
3.04      The Project would be administered by BOR which would establish a
Project account through which PAs would rediscount their subloans. Credit to
sub-borrowers would be channeled thr-ough financial intermediaries as described
in paragraph 3.23.
3.05      Loans would be made to sub-borrowers on the basis of technically
and financially evaluated investment plans. The participating agencies (PAs)
would make these evaluations and would be resporisible for ensuring that sub-
borrowers would receive adequate technical assistance.
3.06      The main components of the lending program are summarized in the
following section.



- 11 -
B. Detailed Features
Project Area and Scope
3.07      The Project would be country-wide and would provide investment
finance for the whole agricultural sector with the exception of coffee and
fisheries. The major crop production areas are shown on Map IBRD 11689 and
the livestock production areas on Map IBRD 11690. The on-farm land improve-
ments for annual crop production would be principally within and near exist-
ing irrigation districts. The establishment of perennial crops, for example,
cocoa and citrus, the rehabilitation of sugarcane mainly for non-centrifuged
sugar (panela) production, and farm forestry sub-projects would be primarily
within or close to the coffee growing regions.
Annual Crops
3.08      Under the Project, about 3,700 farmers, either as individuals or
groups, would be financed to prepare land for irrigation by clearing about
16,400 ha, leveling about 49,200 ha, and providing minor drainage and irri-
gation canals for about 46,000 ha, and also to purchase farm machinery (500
tractors and sets of equipment and 125 combine harvesters). A limited number
of farmers is expected to require subloans for pumps and sprinkler equipment,
mainly to irrigate horticultural crops on land (15,000 ha) unsuitable for
flood irrigation. In the highlands, the production of potatoes, wheat and
barley on small farms would be particularly encouraged through the provision
of subloans for minor farm investments, including the purchase of work oxen
and associated equipment. Purchases of fertilizer and other inputs of a
seasonal nature used in the production of annual crops would not be eligible
for long-term financing under the Project.
Farm Machinery Contractors
3.09      Under the Project, subloans would be made to help finance the pur-
chase of about 400 tractors and sets of implements and 100 combine harvesters
by about 100 contractors, cooperative societies and other associations of
farmers. Small-scale farmers who are not members of organized groups would
need to hire land preparation equipment and crop harvesting machinery in order
to exploit fully the investments in land improvement. Two crops a year can be
produced under irrigation, provided that harvesting is completed on time and
the land is rapidly prepared between crops. Several machinery contractors
already operate in the irrigation districts and some cooperative societies
have organized pools of machinery for use by their members.
Perennial Crops
3.10      Under the Project, subloans would be made to help finance the
replanting of 6,000 ha of sugarcane to be grown under intensive methods.



- 12 -
Processing facilities for sugarcane would also be improved on 600 farms.
Average yields would be expected to increase from the present 3 m ton of
panela/ha to about 6 m ton/ha, which should be sufficient to meet the steadily
rising domestic demand without devoting additional land to its production.
Subloans would also be made to help finance the establishment of such peren-
nial crops as cocoa, 6,000 ha; plantain, about 3,000 ha; citrus, some 1,500
ha; and also some bananas and oil palm. About 900 subloans would be made for
perennial crops. It is also envisaged that the farm forestry schemes in the
areas above the main coffee zone would be further expanded. Expenditures on
all inputs used in the establishment of perennial crops (in the years before
the crops start to produce) would be regarded as investments and consequently
would be eligible for long-term finance. Other related on-farm investment such
as storage facilities and drying equipment would, of course, also be eligible
for financing under the Project (Annex 4).
Small Farm Livestock Development
3.11      Under the Project, subloans would be made to help finance develop-
ment on about 2,600 farms, most of them devoted to beef production, but where
cows are also milked. While participating farms could be located anywhere in
the country, most are expected to be on the Caribbean coastal plains, upper
and middle Magdalena basin, and the Andean foothills, where about 70% of the
cattle population is grazed and most of the small dual-purpose livestock enter-
prises are found. Some 400 operations involving small animals such as sheep,
goats, pigs, poultry, and rabbits would also be financed, either as indepen-
dent enterprises or run jointly with cattle. The average farm participating
would have about 40 ha of grassland, of which about 15 ha (38%) would be im-
proved, constituting the main physical investment category. Other invest-
ments would be fencing, mainly internal fences to subdivide paddocks and make
better use of the forage; water supply; and handling facilities for cattle;
machinery; and equipment. It was assured during negotiations that livestock
investments financed under the Project on small commercial farms (para 3.29)
would be confined to breeding stock and that purchase of breeding stock would
not be permitted to exceed 75% of sub-project investment cost. Purchases of
fattening animals would not be included in investment plans (Annex 5).
Medium and Large Livestock Farm Development
3.12      Under the Project, subloans would be made to help finance about
1,000 dairy farms located mainly in the temperate and cool zones of the
Andes. The average size of the farms would be about 60 ha of grazing land,
about one-half of which would be replanted with a legume-grass combination
and fertilized. The existing better pastures would be improved by weeding
and phosphatic fertilization to help establish legumes. Investments would
also be made in fencing, water supply, machinery and equipment, and construc-
tion or repair of milking sheds and roads.  It was assured during negotia-
tions that investments for dairy cattle financed under the Project would be
confined to breeding stock and that purchase of such breeding stock would
not be permitted to exceed 75% of sub-project investment cost. Purchases
of fattening animals would not be included in investment plans (Annex 5).



- 13 -
3.13      About 500 beef breeding/fattening operations would be financed under
the Project. The average farm for beef breeding/fattening enterprises would
have about 2,000 ha and be located in the Orinoco plains and Amazon basin.
Only about 120 ha on each farm would be put under improved pasture and it is
expected that little or no machinery would be purchased. Fences, mostly
perimeter; water points; corrals; and other facilities for cattle handling
would be built, but breeding stock would be the highest single investment in
most sub-projects. It was assured during negotiations that livestock invest-
ments (other than in dairying) financed under the Project on other than small
commercial farms would be confined to breeding stock and that purchase of such
breeding stock would not be permitted to exceed 60% of sub-project investment
cost. Purchases of fattening animals would not be included in investment plans
(Annex 5).
Agro-industrial Investment
3.14      Increasing production from commercial farming will create a need for
investments in processing facilities for agricultural products. The Project
would be primarily aimed at financing small companies (defined as those having
total assets not exceeding US$750,000) but larger companies would not be ex-
cluded from participation within the maximum aggregate borrowing per individual
undertaking of US$500,000 to be permitted under the Project (para 3.29). Some
15 types of agro-industrial enterprises are expected to generate about 190
sub-loan applications (Annex 6).

3.15      It is expected that the bulk of the investment would be for plants
processing staples (rice, sugar, poultry products), associated inputs (animal
feed processing), service industries (grain storage, cold storage, seed pro-
cessing), and export industries (flowers, fruits and vegetables). Representa-
tive models have been developed for a grain drying and storage plant and for
a small feedmill (Annex 6). The two models show that working capital needs
for small agro-industry in Colombia vary greatly, and it is estimated that an
amount equivalent to 150% of investment costs would be required to finance
incremental working capital over the four-year Project disbursement period
(para 3.17). The main investment items would be machinery and equipment.
C. Cost Estimates
3.16      The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$174.1 million, of
which US$64.0 million, or 37%, represents foreign exchange requirements.
Costs have been estimated at 1975 end-of-year prices, and a weighted average
price contingency of 37% of baseline costs for the foreign exchange require-
ments and 76% for the local costs have been added for all items to take into
consideration anticipated local and international price changes from 1975 to
1980. These price contingencies are based on the inflation index for exports
of manufactured goods from developed countries and the projected Colombian
domestic price index as estimated by the Bank. To correct for the differ-
ences between international and domestic inflation, and in view of the Govern-
ment's policy to encourage exports, the exchange rate has been projected to
average Col$ 44.1 = US$1 during the investment period.

D. Financing
3.17      Financing would be shared in the following amounts and proportions:
Sub-        Banking
borrowers       System          Bank         Total
US$ mil  %    US$ mil  %    US$ mil  %  US$ mil   %

Baseline costs        30.3   22    61.9   44         46.6   34   138.8  100
Contingencies          6.0   17    11.9   35         17.4   48    35.3  100
Total Project cost   36.3   21    73.8   42          64.0   37   174.1  100
As shown above, the Project would be financed as follows:  (a) the Bank loan
of US$64.0 million, or 37% of Project cost, would cover all the foreign ex-
change costs; (b) BOR and PAs would contribute US$73.8 million, or 42% of
Project cost; and (c) sub-borrowers would finance US$36.3 million, or 21% of
Project cost. In addition, small farmers are expected to provide, in kind,
family labor estimated at about US$1.5 million. Small farmer sub-borrowers
would be required to contribute at least 15% and other farmers, machinery
contractors and agro-industry sub-borrowers at least 25% of the cost of their
investment. Assurances on the above cost sharing were obtained during the
negotiations. In addition, it was assured during negotiations that the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement (para 3.23) to be entered into by BOR and each PA
would contain a commitment by the PA to provide the necessary complementary
short-term loan funds to Project beneficiaries to cover their working capital
requirements and a corresponding commitment by BOR to provide rediscount
facilities as required.
E. Procurement
3.18      The on-farm investment items to be financed for the approximately
9,300 sub-borrowers (about 12,000 farm families) throughout Colombia over the
four-year investment period are varied and would not be suitable for bulk
procurement through international competitive bidding. Land development would



- 18 -
be undertaken on contract by small local contractors or by the sub-borrowers
themselves. Goods required for such development would be obtained through
existing commercial channels, which are satisfactory. Most international
suppliers of the imported items are well represented in Colombia, competition
is keen and service facilities are widespread and adequate.
3.19      The farm machinery and agro-industrial units to be financed would
vary in nature, size, capacity and number. Grouping of contracts would,
therefore, not be practicable and individual contracts would not be expected
to attract any response through international competitive bidding. However,
BOR would ensure that at least three bids would be obtained by sub-borrowers
whenever the cost of machinery and equipment in a single investment exceeded
US$150,000. BOR would make available to sub-borrowers, at its offices and
at the offices of PAs, a catalog of suppliers of agro-industrial machinery,
including in it those from Bank member countries and Switzerland, as well as
their agents or representatives in Colombia. Moreover, after the Bank loan
is signed, BOR would write to all the embassies in Colombia of Bank member
countries and Switzerland, informing them of the details of the agro-
industrial component of the Project and giving the broad particulars of the
types of machinery likely to be required by sub-borrowers. During negotia-
tions, assurances were obtained that procurement would be in accordance with
the above procedures.
F. Disbursement
3.20      Investments by sub-borrowers, and thus disbursements of subloans,
would be spread over four years. Of the proposed loan of US$64 million, an
amount of US$14 million would be reserved for small commercial farmers.
Bank loan disbursements would take about four-and-a-half years and would be
made against certificates of expenditure for the appropriate percentage of
Project subloan values rediscounted by BOR as follows:
Percentage of Subloan Values
Subloan Category                               Reimbursed by Bank
Small commercial farmers                                39
Other farmers and machinery contractors                 37
Agro-industries                                         60
The supporting documentation for such expenditures would be retained by BOR
and made available for examination by Bank supervision missions. Bank dis-
bursements on the proposed loan of US$64.0 million are expected to be about
US$3.0 million in FY77, US$14.5 million in FY78, US$21.5 million in FY79,
US$14.0 million in FY80 and US$11.0 million in FY81 (Annex 7).



- 19 -
G. Organization and Management
3.21      BOR would administer the Project through the office of the Sub-
Manager for Credit, who supervises the two specialized departments that would
be involved--the Agricultural C;edit Department and the Development Credit
Department (Chart). Lending for on-farm development, machinery contractors
and agro-industries would be handled through an account to be established for
the Project. An assurance to this effect was obtained during negotiations.
3.22      During 1975 the Agricultural Credit Department strengthened its staff
to meet the increasing volume of work. The Development Credit Department has
been the channel for seven Bank loans which have been made since 1964 to fi-
nance industrial development. It has been hampered in the past by loss of
staff to private industry but has recently regained its strength. Moreover,
under the Sixth DFC Loan, signed in March 1976, BOR committed itself to
maintaining a staff in the Development Credit Department adequate in numbers
and quality for carrying out Bank-financed projects. A Bank-assisted training
program for the Department's staff, begun under the Fifth DFC project, will be
continued under the Sixth DFC project.
3.23      The BOR would onlend through Subsidiary Loan Agreements to PAs.
Such agreements would specify the type of subloans eligible; the types and
proportion of investment to be financed; the proportion of the financing to be
rediscounted by BOR; the rates of interest and terms to be approved; procedures
for procurement, accounting and auditing; and the provision of technical
assistance. The signing of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement, acceptable to the
Bank, between BOR and CAJA AGRARIA would be a condition of effectiveness. For
agro-industry, a PA could be any financial institution entitled to use the
rediscount facilities operated by the Development Credit Department.
3.24      It would be the responsibility of BOR to ensure that investments
financed by subloans under the Project are for the purposes authorized and
that they are technically, financially and economically sound. During
negotiations, assurances to this effect were obtained. In order to discharge
this responsibility, BOR would require all PAs to follow evaluation procedures
for subloans satisfactory to it.
3.25      All subloans would be based on detailed investment plans, which
would include cash flow projections and estimates of expected changes in key
production coefficients. Small commercial farmers would be assisted by the
technical staff of the PAs or ICA in the preparation of farm development
plans, while applications for subloans from larger farmers and for agro-
industrial development would be supported by feasibility studies prepared to
the satisfaction of the PA concerned. In all subloans, the development plav
or feasibility study would form part of the subloan application. It was
assured during negotiations that it would be a condition of participation in
the Project that each PA has a technical staff that, in the opinion of BOR, is
of sufficient size and training to ensure that the investments financed by
subloans granted by the PA are for the purposes authorized and that they are
technically and financially sound.



- 20 -
3.26      In order to assist BOR to discharge its responsibility for the
quality of Project investments, BOR would establish within six months of loan
signing a monitoring system, satisfactory to the Bank, including at least 5%
of sub-borrower farms to collect technical and financial data of sufficient
quantity and quality to enable an evaluation to be made of the overall success
of the Project in achieving its objectives. Assurances to this effect were
obtained during negotiations.
H. Lending Operations
3.27      PAs would make medium- and long-term subloans for crop and livestock
development and machinery contractors, and these would be rediscounted by BOR
in accordance with FFAP rates and rediscount margins currently in force
(para. 2.18). Subloans for agro-industry investments would be rediscounted
by BOR in accordance with FF1 and FIP rates and rediscount margins currently
in force. The BOR would be permitted to vary the rediscount margins between
the percentages of the subloans to be financed by the Bank (para. 3.20) and
100% in the light of Government policy and the demand for funds by the banking
system. It is expected that lending to small commercial farmers and small
agro-industrial enterprises would be promoted by providing more favorable
rediscounting terms for this category of subloan. For the purpose of estimat-
ing the project cash flows for BOR and the PAs it has been projected that over
the period of the project BOR would rediscount 90% of subloans to small com-
mercial farmers, 85% of subloans to other farmers and machinery contractors,
and 60% of subloans for agro-industries (Annexes 8 and 9). The initial rates
would be as follows:
Minimum
Category of         Interest Rates    Percent of Subloan          Rediscount Rates to
Sub-borrower        to Sub-borrower        Rediscounted       Participating Agencies (%)
%         Minimum  Initial Range Initial Range   Maximum
Small commercial           15           39        65-85           12.25-13.00    13
farmers
Other farmers and          15           37         65-85          12.25-13.00    13
machinery
contractors
Agro-industries            18 /1        60         60-85          14.00-23.00    23
/1   As of November 30, 1976, FFI rates ranged between 22% and 24% per annum
in Bogota, Medellin and Cali and from 18% to 20% per annum elsewhere;
FIP rates ranged between 23.5% and 26% per annum in Bogota, Medellin and
Cali and from 20% to 23% per annum elsewhere. Within each locality for
FFI interest rates vary according to whether the assets of the borrowers
are greater or less than Col$ 5 million (US$167,000) and fo- FTP' .ro-ding
to the term of the loan.



- 21 -
3.28      For farmers, costs in addition to interest, such as premiums for
life insurance, and prepayment of interest, would raise the effective cost of
capital to between 17%,' and 19% per annum. In addition, all farm sub-borrowers
except small commercial farmers would be required to expend annually on private
technical assistance the equivalent of at least 2% of the outstanding balance
of the subloan. The Bank would initiate with the Government and BOR a review
of subloan interest rates and other lending and rediscount terms whenever, in
the opinion of the Bank, changes in economic conditions make it advisable to
do so. If, within 60 days of the initiation of the review, agreement could
not be reached between the Government, the Bank and BOR on any of the lending
or rediscount terms, BOR would cause PAs to suspend commitment of subloans
until agreement had been achieved. Assurances were obtained on this matter
at negotiations.
3.29      The proposed Project would be focussed particularly on channeling
credit to commercial farmers, US$14 million of the proposed Bank loan being
reserved for those having gross assets not exceeding the equivalent of
US$25,000, including land, the greater part of which is invested in farming
activities, and who derive at least 75% of their income from farming. For the
purpose of the Project, farmers with gross assets less than US$25,000 equivalent
are described as small commercial farmers. Borrowing under this category
would be limited to an aggregate US$10,000 per individual sub-borrower during
the life of the Project. Groups of small farmers would be permitted to borrow
up to an aggregate of US$10,000 multiplied by the number of members of the
group. The maximum aggregate borrowing for other farmers and machinery con-
tractors would be US$100,000, and for agro-industries the maximum would be
US$500,000.
3.30      Repayment terms for subloans would be flexible and would reflect
the forecast cash flows of the enterprises to be financed. Terms would range
from two to 15 years and would include grace periods of one to five years.
3.31      The Subsidiary Loan Agreements between BOR and PAs (para 3.23) would
inter alia:
(a) incorporate the rediscount and sublending terms in accordance with
paragraphs 3.27, 3.29 and 3.30;
(b) provide that the rediscounts granted by BOR would be repayable
by the PA following the same repayment schedule provided by the
PA to its sub-borrowers;
(c) provide for the employment of technical staff by PAs as required
by BOR (para 3.25); and
(d) cover the obligations of BOR and the PAs for the provision of
complementary short-term loans to finance working capital
requirements of sub-borrowers (para 3.17).
It was assured during negotiations that the signing of a Subsidiary Loan
Agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, between BOR and a PA would be a condition
of disbursement by the Bank in respect of subloans made by that PA.



- 22 -
I.   Accounts and Auditing
3.32      The accounting procedures of BOR and other banks which may partici-
pate in the Project are acceptable. BOR's accounts are subject to a continuing
audit by its internal audit department and to an annual audit by the Superin-
tendent of Banks. Accounts of the other banks which would participate in the
Project are audited to satisfactory standards by external auditors approved by
BOR. CAJA AGRARIA's accounts are audited by the Superintendent of Banks.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that audited copies of BOR
Project accounts certified by independent auditors and copies of Project
accounts of PAs certified by auditors approved by BOR would be sent to the
Bank within four months of the end of the financial year.
IV. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, PRICES AND PRODUCER BENEFITS
Production
4.01      The financial net value of the overall incremental production by
farmers financed under the project would be Col$ 2,355 million (US$78.5
million) per annum at full development based on 1975 on-farm prices. This
is mainly because of the introduction of irrigation to areas previously
cropped under dry-land conditions, the introduction of new land into crop
production and the improvement of grazing land. Yield increases from the
Project are based on current yields on well managed farms. These are no
more than half of the level achieved under research conditions and are con-
sidered realistic. The projected incremental production arising from the
Project per annum at full development (compared to 1975 production levels)
is as follows:
Incremental Project Production

- 23 -
Marketing
4.02      Project production, except for cotton, rice and beef, should be
regarded as import substitutes. Sugarcane for non-centrifuged sugar (panela)
production is considered to be for the Colombian market, although Colombia is
a net exporter of sugar. None of the Project's commodities appear to face
market demand or structural constraints on the internal market. Colombia's
position as an exporter of cotton fibers is considered to be strong. Diffi-
culties in exporting beef are expected to be resolved when the European Common
Market lifts its ban on beef imports. During 1975, Colombia became a net
exporter of rice and experienced some initial difficulties in exporting rice
in large quantities. However, market prospects for rice are expected to be
good in this part of the world and, with relatively high yields, Colombian
rice producers are very competitive. The processing and marketing of the
incremental production of the Project is expected to be handled primarily by
the existing public and private enterprises. The Project's agro-industry
component will help to establish new agro-industries in regions with large
incremental production.
Prices
4.03      The price situation for Project commodities is expected to be favor-
able. In the domestic market, prices are expected to be high as a result of
inadequate supply, while international prices for exported beef in 1975 con-
stant terms are expected to increase over the next 10 years, but only by half
as much as prices for the better quality Argentine beef. Cotton prices on
the international market are predicted to be stable over the next 10 years in
constant 1975 terms while rice prices are projected to fall from the excep-
tionally high 1975 level but, over the next 10 years, they are not expected
to fall in constant 1975 terms below the prevailing financial price. The
rice farmer can therefore expect his income to remain high.

tion models (Annexes 4, 5 and 6), is given below:

5.01      The Project is of high priority because it would reduce constraints
imposed on the Colombian agricultural sector by the lack of resources for
medium- and long-term credit and a scarcity of savings by small farmers.
The reduction of these constraints through the availability of more credit
should increase output, which would lead to higher exports, increased employ-
ment and improvement in the incomes of the poorer classes in Colombia. Under
the assumptions made in Annex 10, the overall economic rate of return is
estimated at approximately 28%. If a shadow exchange rate 20% higher than the
existing exchange rate is assumed--a figure calculated from tariffs on imports
and subsidies on exports--the economic rate of return is about 49%. The use
of a shadow wage rate (0.7 times the nominal wage for unskilled labor and 0.8
times the nominal wage for semi-skilled labor) because of the unemployment
raises the economic rate of return to about 57%. A sensitivity analysis was
done with a lower shadow exchange rate, about 10% higher than the nominal
exchange rate, because the elimination of some export subsidies has reduced
the extent of overvaluation. Then with this shadow exchange rate and the
shadow wage rates, the economic rate of return was 54%. The economic rate of
return in the base case was estimated at 22% for livestock, 33% for crop farms
and 25% for agro-industries.

5.02      The value of the incremental output of rice, cocoa, soybeans,
sugarcane, cotton, fruits and vegetables, beef and milk would be US$86
million when fully developed and valued at 1975 international prices. In-
creased rice and beef produc-tion should lead to higher exports, as would
cotton, whether directly as cotton fiber or indirectly as cotton textiles.
This would help export diversification. Increased production of cocoa and
soybeans would save foreign exchange as these commodities are now imported.
The net foreign exchange savings of the Project at full development would
be about US$50 million a year. The other products are mainly for domestic
consumption, though panela production would substitute sugar which in turn
can be exported. The increase in production is necessary in order to meet
the increased demands forthcoming due to the expected rise in per capita
income. Furthermore, the expanded production of basic grains, fruits and
vegetables and milk should help to overcome the protein and calorie short-
ages of the deficient groups.
5.03      The Project would provide additional wage employment in agro-
industries and on the farms to roughly 8,000 people. It would also increase
the amount of family labor used on about 5,000 small farms, thus lowering
underemployment. Furthermore, it would provide employment in industries
supplying goods to the farms and agro-industries. The agricultural tool
producing industry is suffering from under-utilization of capacity as the
farmers demanding these tools cannot finance them. By providing the credit,
the Project would enable this demand to be realized and end the under-
utilization of capacity in the industry, providing additional employment
there.
5.04      The Project would help the poorer classes to the extent that small
commercial farmers receive subloans, and it would provide jobs for unskilled
labor both on the farm and in agro-industries.
VI.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      During negotiations, the following main assurances were obtained
from BOR that:
(i) livestock investments financed under the Project would be
confined to breeding stock and would not be permitted to
exceed 75% of sub-project investment cost in the case of
small farmers and dairy farmers and 60% in the case of beef
ranchers and that sub-project investment cost would be ex-
clusive of fattening animals (paras 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13);
(ii) the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between BOR and each PA would
contain a commitment by the PA to provide the necessary
complementary short-term loan funds to Project beneficiaries
to cover their working capital requirements and a corres-
ponding commitment by BOR to provide rediscount facilities
as required (para 3.17);



- 26 -
(iii) BOR would assume responsibility for ensuring that investments
financed by subloans under the Project are for the purposes
authorized and that they are technically, financially and
economically sound (para 3.24);
(iv) it would be a condition of participation in the Project that
each PA would have a technical staff that, in the opinion of BOR,
is of sufficient size and training to ensure that the invest-
ments financed by subloans granted by the PA are used for
the purposes authorized and that they are technically and finan-
cially sound (para 3.25);
(v) BOR would establish within six months of loan signing a
monitoring system, satisfactory to the Bank, including at
least 5% of sub-borrower farms to collect technical and
financial data of sufficient quantity and quality to enable
an evaluation to be made of the overall success of the
Project in achieving its objectives (para 3.26);
(vi) a review of sub-borrower lending terms and conditions would
be carried out with the Government and the Bank whenever, in
the opinion of any one of them, changes in the economic condi-
tions in Colombia make it advisable to do so (para 3.28); and
(vii) the signing of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement, satisfactory to
the Bank, between BOR and a PA would be a condition of dis-
bursement by the Bank in respect of subloans made by that
PA (para 3.32).
6.02      It would be a condition of loan effectiveness that BOR had signed
a Subsidiary Loan Agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, with CAJA AGRARIA
(para 3.23).
6.03      With the indicated assurances, the proposed Project constitutes a
suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$64.0 million for a term of 15 years, in-
cluding a 3-1/2-year grace period. The Borrower would be BOR, which would
assume the exchange risk.

COLOMBIA
SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
The Agricultural Sector
A. Resource Base
General Features
1.        Colombia covers an area of 114 million ha, distributed in four dis-
tinct regions as follows (IBRD Map 11689):
million ha     percentage
The Caribbean coastal plain               14             12
The Pacific coastal plain                  7              6
The Andean mountain ranges                28             25
The Orinoco and Amazon basins             65             57
114            100
2.        The Andean region, which is most important to the agricultural
sector, is formed by three mountain ranges within which most of the small-scale,
traditional agriculture is carried out and where all the coffee is grown,
usually on steep hillsides. The two major inter-Andean valleys of the Cauca
and the Magdalena rivers contain the majority of the large-scale farming
enterprises. The population of 24 million is distributed unevenly, with only
3% living on the plains east of the Andes, which constitute 57% of the total
land area.
Ecological Conditions
3.        The wide range of altitudes in Colombia, from sea level to 5,780 m
(Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta), provides a great diversity of ecological
circumstances in which conditions can be found for almost any type of farming
activity. Annual rainfall ranges from 190 mm in Bahia Honda near the Venezuelan
frontier in the North to about 10,000 mm in Lloro in the Pacific coastal plain.
In the principal farming areas, however, annual rainfall is usually between
1,500 and 3,000 mm. There are two wet seasons, the timing varying considerably
from the southern frontier, which extends to 4' south of the equator, to the
Caribbean Coast, between 8 and 12° north.
Land Use
4.        The agricultural census of 1970/71 included 1.2 million farm units,
covering a total of 31 million ha, or 27% of the surface area of Colombia.
Land use at that time was as follows:



ANNEX 1
Page 2
Cropland                  million ha            percentage
Permanent crops                2.3                    7
Seasonal crops                 2.1                    7
Fallow and grassland
cultivated within

Sub-total                      7.6                  24
Grassland                     17.5                   57
Unused land within
existing farms                5.9                   19
Total                         31.0                 100
5.        There is evidence in several parts of the country that raising
such crops as cotton, rice and sugarcane is replacing livestock operations
in the rich or flat soils, while cattle production is moving further up the
hills and deep into the "llanos" savannahs of the Orinoco basin. Typical
areas where this change in land utilization is taking place are the Cauca
Valley, the Caribbean plains around Monteria and Valledupar, and the Andean
foothills near Villavicencio where it is estimated tnat about 200,000 ha of
grassland has been replaced by crops.
Farm_Size Distribution
6.        TI  1970/71, about 860,000 farms of less than 10 ha constituted 73%
of the total of 1.2 million farm units but covered only 7% of the area sur-
veyed. About 5,000 farms of over 100 ha represented only 4% of the total
number, but covered 68% of the area.
B. Role of Agriculture in the Economy
7.        The value added in the agricultural sector has grown rapidly since
1973 and it is estimated that, in 1974, it was 5% higher than in 1973.
Annual Percentage Increase in Value
Added in tVe Agricultural Sector
1953 to 1963                               3.0
1963 to 1973                               4.5
1973 to 1974                               5.0



ANNEX 1
Page 3
Fishing, forestry and miscellaneous components of agricultural output account
for less than a tenth of the total, but their combined rate of growth has been
greater than that of the crop and livestock sub-sectors.
8.        Livestock production has been an important socio-economic factor
for the development of Colombia since colonial times, although its economic
significance as a percentage of the GNP has slightly decreased during the last
15 years, due to the higher rate of growth of the industrial and commercial
sectors. Although the percentage has decreased, in absolute terms its value
nearly doubled from 1960 to 1974 (Table 1).
9.        In spite of the substantial growth of the agricultural sector, its
contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP) has declined because of the
faster rate of growth in the other sectors. In 1974, the agricultural sector
provided 26%' of the GDP and 65% of the foreign exchange earnings from merchan-
dise exports (excluding petroleum). In addition, in 1975, approximately 38%
of the economically active population lived in the rural areas.
10.       Growth of the agricultural sector has kept pace with the growth in
population (3.2%), principally as a result of the rapid development of commer-
cial farms, the productivity of which as a group has increased about 7% a year
since 1970. There has been little improvement, however, in the average diet
over the past decade. The traditional farming subsector provides 55% of the
national food sunplv. It has increased its outnut, but more slowlv than the
rate of population growth. Furthermore, in the nast decade there has been
no irprovement in the nualitv of the average diet.
C. Government Policy
I1.       The Colombian administration which assumed office in August 1974
has focused special attention on improving the levels of human nutrition,
particularly of the poorest sector of the population and to this end has
prepared a National Food and Nutrition Plan. This Plan identifies the
following five main components for the stimulation of food production:
(a) investment in research and the adaptation of new varieties
for production on small farms;
(b) an integrated rural development program;
(c) a national agricultural credit program to be channeled through
the Fondo Financiero Agropecuario - Agricultural Financing
Fund - (FFAP) in which high priority 1/ is to be given to the
production of cereals, legumes, starch crops, and animal products;
1/   Criteria for the selection of these foods are given on page 2 of "Plan
Nacional de Alimentacion y Nutricion - Seleccion de Alimentos" DNP-UPS-
D)PN-OLL October 18, 1974.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
(d) investment in agro-industries; and
(e) investment in the development and marketing of fishery products.
The investments envisaged under the proposed Project form part of items (c)
and (d) of this "'lan.
12.       The objectives for the agricultural sector are defined by the
Colombian authorities with reference to the National Food and Nutrition Plan,
the distribution of income and the need to conserve or earn foreign exchange.
There are seven elements to this general strategy:
(a) raising the general level of rural income through intensify-
ing the use of land for crop and livestock production and
increasing the number of breeding animals in the national
cattle herd;
(b) increasing the availability of foodstuffs for the domestic
market, including in particular (i) the supply of milk for
mothers and infants; (ii) maize, rice, sorghum and wheat;
(iii) beans, soybeans and other oilseed crops, including cotton;
(iv) potatoes and horticultural crops; (v) sugarcane for panela, 1/
cassava and plantains; and (vi) oil palm, coconuts and fruits,
including citrus and pineapples;
(c) assuring incomes for small-scale (campesino minifundistas) farmers
by establishing guaranteed minimum prices for their products;
(d) improving the market system for farm products to reduce transfer
and marketing costs and thereby to raise the margin of profit to
the producers;
(e) raising production to provide exportable surpluses of beef, maize,
rice sorghum and sovbeans, but with no promotion of additional
coffee production;
(f) raising production in order to reduce imports of barley and wheat,
vegetable oils, cotton and cocoa; and
(g) increasing the availabilitv of sisal for fiber, and forest products
for timber and pulp for the manufacture of paper.
D. Crop Subsector
Export Crops
13.       Coffee.  Coffee continues to be the principal export crop and in 1974
provided 44% of the foreign exchange earnings fromr merchandise exports. It
1/   "Panela" is non-centrifugal sugar which forms an important part of
the national diet.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
occupies about 1 million ha, which is an area greater than that used for any
othler crop.  In 197( about 207 of all farmLs in Colombia grew some coffee.
The average coffee farm size was 15 ha withl 3.5 ha of coffee. Coffee uprooting
is continuing in the less favorable areas and the productivity of the majority
of the old coffee is declining.  The sharp increase in the world market price
for coffee in the second half of 1975 may be expected to stimulate renewed
interest in this crop (Table 2).
14.       Banana.  Production is principally in the Caribbean coastal region.
Small farmer plantations are mostly centered on Santa Marta while tthe larger
holdings of over 50 hla are to the west in Uraba.  During the period 1970 to
1974, average annual production was just under 350,000 ton-s from 15,000 ha.
The Government had planned to increase the area to about 19,000 ha by 1976
and to raise thie annual production to 775,000 tons; however, it is unlikely
that this will be achieved. Since domestic consumption is little more than
60,000 tons a year, it is evident that a substantial increase in exports had
been expectecd. Long-term export constraints are currently under study; mean-
while, it would appear that a more modest expansion program would be prudent,
with the emphasis being principally on establishing a greater area of the
Cavendish variety In Uraba.
15.       Cotton.  The main production areas are in the Caribbean region, the
Andean piedmont area of Meta in the Orinoco basin and the inter-Andean valleys.
In the Caribbean and Meta regions, 50% of cotton farmers manage 75% of the
area (46 ha of cotton per farmer), while in the interior, 507 of the cotton
farmers cultivate 25% of the area of the crop (15 ha of cotton per farmer).
Over 907 of the area of cotton is on medium and large farms and, with the
notable exception of settlers within INCORA project areas, there is little
pro(duction of cotton by small-scale farmers. Production in 1974 reached a
record level of 146,000 tons of fiber from 259,000 ha (average production 1965
to 1969; 1(4,000 tons from 203,000 ha).  Provisional statistics for exports in
1974 are 50,800 tons valued at U1S$73 million. With effect from the 1975/76
season, the domestic price for seed cotton has been brought into line with the
equivaLent prevailing world market prices.  Thlis Is expected to provide an
Incentive to raise production to about 175,000 tons of fiber by 1976.
16.       Sugar_(Centrif ugal).  Cane for the production of centrifugal sugar
is grown mainly in tlhe Cauca valley. The harvested area has increased gra-
dually from 69,000 ha in 1970, producing 672,200 tons, to 79,400 ha in 1974,
producing 897,500 tons.  Registered exports In 1974 totalled 134,000 tons
valued provisionally at US$64 million, and, in addition, it is believed that
a considerable quantity was exported illegally. A vigorous expansion program
is under way to raise the harveste(d area to 83,800 ha by 1976, yielding, it
is hoped, over 1 million tons, of whicih the exportable surplus would he some
166,000 tons.
17.       Tobacco.  Bloth blond (Virginia and Blurley) and black tobaccos are
grown In Colombia; however, only the black tobacco of the Caribbean coast is
exported.  In 1973, production of black tobacco rose to an unprecedented level
of 37,800 tons (174% of 1972 productioni) for which tthe marketing system was



ANNEX 1
Page 6
totally inadequate to handle satisfactorily the 28,000 tons which was exported
for US$22 million. In 1974, the area planted dropped to 8,000 ha (56% of 1973
area); however, preliminary reports indicate that 10,800 tons was exported at
a satisfactory price, bringing in US$28 million. The export market will
probably be maintained at about this level, and future expansion of both
blond and black tobacco will be undertaken to satisfy the domestic market
and to reduce imports of blond tobacco and cigarettes.
18.       Flowers.  Flower exports have increased in value from less than
US$1 million in 1970 to just over US$16 million in 1974. The development of
flower production for export has been concentrated around Bogota where climatic
conditions are favorable, there is an international airport, and an ample
supply of labor is available. The rapid rate of growth was halted in 1975
as a result of the unfavorable international market situation, but it is
expected that expansion will resume, although at a more modest rate, as world
economic conditions improve.
Products for Domestic Consumption
19.       Barley.  Production has fluctuated about an average (1970-74) of
94,000 tons a year from 56,000 ha; however, the malting industry, in collabo-
ration with the Ministry of Agriculture, is aiming to raise production to
attain national self-sufficiency in this crop by 1976. In 1974, national
production totalled 97,000 tons, while imports of barley and malt amounted
to the equivalent of 72,200 tons of barley, making a total supply of 169,200
tons. The demand was estimated to have been only 150,000 tons; therefore,
there may have been some accumulation of stocks unless the excess was all
used for stock feed and seed.
20.       Maize.  Production of maize has been maintained at about 800,000
tons a year for the past two decades. Although the area has steadily declined,
the average yields have increased from 1 ton/ha to 1.4 tons/ha. In 1974, a
total of 570,100 ha of maize was harvested, of which over 80% was on small
holdings using traditional farming methods.
Area '000 ha   Yield kg/ha    Production '000 tons
Small holdings, tradi-
tional                        469.1         1,164                 546.0

Total                570.1          1,388                791.5
The national development plan projects an average yield of 1.6 tons/ha by
1976, but it seems improbable that this goal will be achieved so soon because
of the predominance of the small-scale farming sector in which maize is a
subsistence crop.



ANNEX 1
Page 7
21.        Rice.  Development of rice in Colombia has been remarkably rapid,
particularly since 1971, as a result of the successful introduction of superior
varieties and the increasing proportion of rice grown under irrigation. In
1974, of the total area of rice (354,000 ha), about two-thirds was under
irrigation and one-third was under dryland conditions. Production of paddy
rice in 1974 exceeded 1.5 million tons, which was one-third more than in the
previous year - the average for 1965 to 1969 was 0.7 million tons a year from
309,000 ha. Total domestic requirements amount to about 1.3 million tons;
therefore, in 1974 for the first time there was a significant exportable
surplus. Unfortunately, unfamiliarity with international market channels
led to delays in exports; however, it is expected that these organizational
problems will be resolved during 1975 and that thereafter it will be possible
to export about 200,000 tons of milled rice a year.
22.        Sorghum.  Sorghum has been promoted vigorously by the animal feed
stuffs industry and has rapidly increased in importance, with production being
doubled between 1970 and 1974 when 336,600 tons were produced from 151,200 ha
(2,226 kg/ha). Some 350,000 tons are expected to be produced in 1975, and by
1976 the Government expects that the harvest will total 442,000 tons. The
great majority of the production is from medium and large-scale farms using
improved seeds, agro-chemicals, and mechanization.
23.       Wheat.  Production has declined from 124,000 tons per annum (1960 to
1964) to 61,000 tons (1970 to 1974) as this crop has been progressively dis-
placed by other more lucrative crops and livestock enterprises. Some 70% of
wheat growers are small farmers located principally in the Department of
Narino. Larger, mechanized wheat farms are mainly in the Cundinamarca and
Boyaca Departments.  Production in 1974 was 54,800 tons, or 13% of the domes-
tic demand of 462,000 tons. Imports of wheat in 1974 totalled 418,000 tons,
or 154,100 more than in the previous year. The Government has taken a number
of steps to limit imports and to increase production in 1975 and subsequent
years; IDEMA is to purchase over half of the 1975 crop (48' of 1974 crop),
millers' subsidies have been abolished, and some wheat flour is to be extended
with rice flour and maize and soybean meals. The Ministry of Agriculture
projects figures for 1975 that imply that production of wheat is expected to
rise substantially in 1975 and that imports will be held to 95,000 tons less
than in 1974. The high price of fertilizers and disease problems - particu-
larly root rots - may restrict the rate of increase in local production. It
is clear that the production of this crop should have high priority in the
upland areas of Colombia; however, further technical and economic research
appears to be necessary before any major expansion may be expected.
24.        Cassava.  This forms a significant part of the diet in Colombia and
it is grown in all Departments, mainly on small farms. The crop is especially
important in the Departments of Valle, Cauca, Bolivar, Sucre and Magdalena
and where it is also grown intensivelv bv some medium-scale farmers. The
national production is estimated at about 1.3 million tons a year from some
163,000 ha. The low average yield of 8 tons/ha may be compared with the
annual production of 20 to 40 tons/ha obtained by farmers specializing in



ANNEX 1
Page 8
this crop. The market price for cassava in the early part of 1975 was parti-
cularly high (Col$3,000 or US$100/ton in the ground, with the buyer paying
for harvesting) and it was expected that this would provoke a surplus of
production and hence a much lower price by the end of the year.
25.       Plantains.  Plantains are of great importance in the domestic market,
and a small export market to the U.S. and neighboring countries has developed
since 1971. Statistics on the area under this crop are particularly unreliable
because it is commonly (25 to 30%) interplanted with coffee and among immature
cocoa trees. Annual production is believed to amount to about 1.4 million tons
from 280,000 ha (5 ton/ha or 33 bunches/ha). The domestic market demand is
strong and, at farmgate prices in the first half of 1975 of up to Col$ 30, or
US$1.00/bunch, there was a considerable incentive to increase production.
26.       Potatoes.  Potatoes are a basic part of the diet of the rural popula-
tion of the Andean highlands and are also important in the main urban centers.
The majority of the producers are small-scale farmers in the Departments of
Cundinamarca, Boyaca, and Narino. Usually, about 60X of the annual area of
potatoes is cultivated in the first semester (Jan./June), which supplies adequately,
and sometimes excessively, the market in the second half of the year. The second
semester crop (July/Dec.) (40%) is often insufficient, however, to meet the
market demand in the first half of the following year. Availability of
potatoes is therefore probably less than total potential demand. In 1974,
production was about 0.9 million tons from 88,000 ha, but by 1976 it is
estimated that the domestic market could absorb over 1 million tons a year.
There is no doubt that production could be increased rapidly if farmers had
more confidence in the marketing system. The principal requirement appears
to be the storage of some of the first semester crop to supplement the supply
to the market in the early part of the following year. The proposed project
would finance such investments.
27.       Common Bean.  Bean production has gradually fallen from 61,000 tons
(1955 to 1959) to about 43,100 tons (1970 to 1974). For many Colombians, the
common bean is a principal source of protein; therefore, the Government hopes
to raise total production in 1976 to 65,700 tons from some 98,000 ha (670
kg/ha); however, there is apparently no specific program to achieve this
objective. Bean yields have gradually increased from an average of 480 kg/ha
between 1955 to 1959 to 610 kg/ha over the last five years (1970 to 1974), but
considerable further improvements should follow the recent intensification of
research into grain legumes at Centro International de Agriculture Tropical
(CIAT).
28.       "Caraota." 1/ Production for export has become locally important in
the Cauca Valley and in parts of Magdalena and Cesar Departments where they
are grown in rotation with cotton. In 1974, the area of black grams, adzuki
1/   The term "caraotas" is used in Colombia to include black grams (Phaseolus
mungo), adzuki beans (P. angularis), and lentils (Lens esculenta).



ANNEX 1
Page 9
beans, and lentils totalled 10,700 ha with a production of 15,600 tons (1.5
tons/ha). The Government hopes for a massive expansion in production to
produce over 55,000 tons by 1976. For 1975 it was reported that there was a
substantial increase in the area sown to Caraotas in response to a continuing
strong external demand and because the yields attainable are over twice the
average yields of the common bean.
29.       Groundnuts.  Groundnuts are grown to a limited extent in Tolima,
Cauca, Boyaca, and Narino, but the total production (1,200 tons from 850 ha
in 1974) is not sufficient to satisfy the national demand for about 5,000 tons,
which is required mainly as comestible nuts.
30.       Soybeans.  Soybean production increased very rapidly during the
1960s to reach 132,000 tons from 67,000 ha (2 tons/ha) in 1970, but during
each of the next four years, production amounted to little more than 100,000
tons, while the level of demand in 1974 exceeded 160,000 tons. It is believed
that this was the consequence of the agricultural pricing policies in effect
at that time. The yields obtained in Colombia are among the highest in the
world and, since only small amounts of fertilizers are used on the crop, the
cost of production has risen less abruptly than for other crops, such as maize.
For the 1974/75 season, the IDEMA guaranteed price to producers was set at
Col$ 7,000/ton (US$233), which it was hoped would lead to the production of
167,400 tons of soybeans in 1975, sufficient to meet local demand.
31.       Sesame.  Sesame has been grown in rotation with cotton and increased in
popularity during the 1960s (1965 to 1969 average, 57,000 ha, 36,000 tons,
0.6 ton/ha). More recently, however, production has dropped, and, in 1974,
only 32,200 ha were harvested, producing 17,200 tons (0.5 ton/ha). Official
projections for 1976 suggest that in that year 30,000 tons should be produced
from 59,500 ha, but it seems unlikely that this target will be met in view of
the greater profitability of alternative crops such as soybeans.
32.       Oil Palm.  This has been developed as a new crop in several Depart-
ments of Colombia and, by the end of 1974, 23,000 ha had been established,
of which some 18,000 ha were bearing. The production of 51,000 tons of crude
oil covered about one-quarter of the national demand. Production is expected
to rise rapidly to about 70,000 tons in 1976 as more palms come into bearing.
33.       Cocoa.  Cocoa is consumed in Colombia principally as a beverage and the
annual per capita consumption is exceeded only by the U.K. and the Netherlands.
The annual requirements are about 34,000 tons, but production in 1974 was no
more than 23,000 tons from 57,900 ha (0.4 ton/ha), of which as much as about
3,000 tons was exported illegally through adjoining countries. There was,
therefore, a deficit of between 11,000 and 14,000 tons during 1974. The two
chocolate companies (Cia de Chocolates Luker and Nacional), two Federations
of farmers (Fedecacao and Prodesarrollo of Fedecafe), INCORA, and COFIAGRO are
all actively engaged in promoting cocoa production, and during 1974 these
various organizations, wlhich have 90 cocoa agronomists and 212 assistants,



ANNEX 1
Page 10
reported a total of 3,400 ha of new planting and an area of 25,000 ha of
mature cocoa. It is planned that 4,000 ha of new cocoa should be planted
annually from 1975 to 1979 and that each year about 1,200 ha of the old trees
should be rehabilitated.
34.       Citrus.  In 1974 the total area of all forms of citrus was about
12,000 ha, producing 285,000 tons of fruit (24 tons/ha). Although the national
citrus plan projected 1,100 ha to be planted in 1974, only 58 ha of new trees
were recorded during the year. This poor performance was attributed to the
relatively high price received for coffee, poor organization of the fruit
market, shortages of planting material, and uncertainties concerning the
operation of the new regulations for agricultural loans. During 1975, changes
took place affecting each of these factors which made it possible to plan a
moderate development program for citrus.
35.       Sisal.  Sisal is grown as a smallholder crop and as many as 90,000
families are involved, principally in the Departments of Antioquia, Cauca, Santan-
der, Narino, Boyaca, Cundinamarca, and Tolima. About 45,000 tons of sisal fiber
is required annually to produce some 70 million sacks, and additional quanti-
ties are required for coarse mats and some handicraft industries. In 1974,
production totalled about 44,000 tons from 31,400 ha and the Government
planned to raise this to 56,000 tons in 1975 by encouraging more severe
cutting. There are, however, many difficulties facing this industry, which
is the least organized of those of major importance to the national economy.
There are plans to form village-level decortication and sack weaving centers
in the main areas of production, but these schemes have not yet been elabo-
rated in detail.
36.       Sugar.  Non-centrifuged sugar, known as "panela" in Colombia, is
produced from cane grown on hillsides, mainly at about 1,300 m altitude.
It is grown throughout the country but it is estimated that over 65% of the
area is within the coffee zone. "Panela" forms an important part of the diet
in the rural areas, and even in Bogota the annual per capita consumption is
estimated to be over 12 kg. In 1974, production totalled 557,000 tons from
197,000 ha (2.8 tons/ha) and authorization was given to export up to 30,000
tons since the domestic consumption was estimated at 525,000 tons/year.
Prices in 1974 and 1975 were high, suggesting internal demand was not fully
met and that an expansion in production is required. It is therefore planned,
as part of the proposed project, to promote the renovation of old cane and to
raise the national average yield of "panela" by about 20%o, to 3.4 tons/ha by
1976, which would provide a total of about 670,000 tons. This yield would be
equivalent to an annual average production of 43 tons of cane/ha, with a
"panela" extraction rate of 8%. With moderately good management, it is usual
to obtain double this yield.
37.       Forestry.  Farm forestry development has been successfully promoted
by the National Federation of Coffee Growers in the upper parts (over 2,000 m)
of the Departments of Antioquia, Caldas, Quindio, Risaralda, and Valle. In
these areas, a total of 1,500 ha of coniferous forest has been planted bv



ANNEX 1
Page 11
groups of farmers associated in forestry corporations (Corporaciones Forestales).
It is planned that the rate of planting in these areas should rise to 1 ,000 ha
a year, and, in other parts of the country, various entities hope to establish
a further 7,800 ha of new forests annually. These schemes do not yet consti-
tute a coherent national forestry development program, but they do represent
an important initial step in the preservation of soil and water resources and
in the future will contribute to the national supply of posts, timber and
woodpulp.
E. Livestock Subsector
General
38.       Out of about 41 million ha of grassland (36% of Colombia's area),
only 48%, or 20 million ha, is utilized to support the national herd of 22.5
million cattle, 2 million sheep and goats, and about 1.5 million horses.
Since most of the unused grassland area is considered unsuitable for crops,
the country has good potential for expanding its livestock production.
39.       It is estimated that 19.4 million of the national herd are beef
cattle and 3.1 million are mainly for milk production. Nevertheless, a
large proportion of the beef herd is milked, especially in the smaller farms
where income from milk is very important.
40.       About 50% of the cattle graze in the fertile Caribbean Coastal
Plains; some 30% are scattered among the Andean foothills, inter-Andean
Valleys (mostly, for dairying), and the medium and high Magdalena Valley;
3% graze in the Pacific watershed; and about 17% are raised in the "llanos"
in the Amazon and Orinoco basins. Most of the unexploited grasslands are in
the "llanos", but constraints such as severe droughts for five to six months
each year, low fertility soils, flooding and drainage problems, and lack of
communications require an extensive grazing pattern. Table 3 shows area of
grassland by Departments and the distribution of cattle (Map IBRD 11690).
41.       The total number of cattle farms and ranches, according to the 1970
census, classified by average herd and property size, is shown in Table 4.
About 50% of the farmers had less than 10 ha with an average of about six head
at a stocking rate of over 2.76 animal units (AU/ha), while those with large
ranches over 1,000 ha had an average of 1,500 head at a stocking rate of about
0.65 AU/ha. The apparent overstocking on the small farms and understocking
on the largest farms could be responsible for the average nroduction coeffi-
cients shown in Table 5.



ANNEX 1
Page 12
Animal Health
42.       ICA, which has 23 centers throughout the country, is responsible for
animal health, including diagnostic services and control of disease and out-
breaks. Its most important programs now deal with foot and mouth disease
(FMD) and brucelosis, and both are well under control. The FMD campaign is
being carried out mainly in the Caribbean Coastal Plains but it is expected
that the whole country will be covered by 1978. In August 1973, the Ministry
of Agriculture of the Government of Colombia and the Department of Agriculture
of the United States agreed to cooperate the control and erradicate FMD in
certain portions of northwest Colombia and to prevent its spread from Colombia
as a result of construction of the Darien Gap Highway.
43.       Internal and external parasites are widespread and ICA and other
private and official institutions are working together to introduce control
practices among farmers (dipping, spraying, drenching). Upgrading with Zebu,
which are more parasite-resistant than the European breeds, is helping to
reduce the problem.
44.       Considerable work is being done to control and erradicate rabies,
which is a potential problem in those areas where only a 50% vaccination rate
is estimated. Cholera in pigs and encephalitis in horses are also present,
but under control.
Beef Cattle
45.       There are three main types of local "Criollo" cattle, the Romosinuano,
Blanco Orejinegro, and San Martinero, which were developed from the original
Spanish cattle by natural selection and crossbreeding with European breeds
such as the Durham, Angus, Holstein, and Normandy. During the last century,
crossbreeding with Zebu gained popularity and, today, mnst of the national
herd has some Zebu blood. There are a sriall herds of Santa Gertrudis,
Charolais, and other specialized breeds, but they are not nationally signi-
ficant.
46.       It has been estilmated that 16.9 million ha of pasture (85% of the
utilized grassland) is occupied by the 19.4 million head beef herd, most of it
under extensive management (Table 6). The improvement of beef production manage-
ment has a great potential since less than 20% of the national herd has been
effected by credit programs wiich provide some technical assistance. Further-
more, about 100,000 heifers which could otherwise be retained to increase the
"llanos" stock, are slaughtered annually. They are sold because of under
current low levels of management, the ranches are stocked to capacity, or
because of liquidity problems. There is little demand for breeding stock
because buvers lack capital, and contact between potential sellers and
buyers is practically non-existent.
47.       In 1974, the extraction rate from the beef herd was 13%.  About
2 million head, or 695,000 tons liveweight, were used for local consump-
tion (average per capita beef consumption was 21.6 kg) and about 500,000 head



AINEX 1
Page 13
were exported. The Government estimated the total value of beef exported in
1974 was US$89.9 million, out of which US$45.3 million was contraband.
Considering that the annual irncrease in the beef herd was an estimated
620,000 -n 1974, 3.2% per year, total productivity is about 16%.
48.       The closing of the European Common Market did not have a severe
detrimental impact on beef prices in Colombia, mainly because only 20% of the
production is exported. However, a law has been in effect since 1973 prohi-
biting the serving of beef in restaurants in 13 principal cities two days a
week to accustom the people to consume other meats so that more beef will be
available for export and the Government recently signed an agreement to sell
615,000 head to Venezuela over the next three years. Actual prices in the
Mtedellin Cattle Market, the largest in the country, range from US$0.42 to
US$0.62/kg liveweight, according to the sex, quality and fatness of the
animal, with an average of US$0.52/kg liveweight for fattened steers of 422 kg.
49.       Future market prospects are good.  Since it is unlikely that
Venezuela, Peru, and Ecuador will be able to increase meat production suffi-
ciently to meet all their needs for some years, they will continue to be good
markets for Colombian beef. Meanwhile, the projected population increase in
Colombia is expected to continue to exceed the rate of increase in beef pro-
duction, thus assuring a buoyant domestic market.
Dairy Cattle
50.       Because of its climate and topography, Colombia has a great poten-
tial for increasing dairy production. Dairy herds, mainly Holstein, Brown
Swiss, Ayrshire, Red Poll, and Normandy, thrive well in the temperate foothills,
Andean Valleys, and in the highlands and constitute a genetic pool for upgrad-
ing native cattle in the tropical areas. It has been estimated that about
46,000 purebred heifers are produced annually, in addition to some 230,000
good quality dairy crossbreds.
51.       Almost 3 million ha of pasture land are devoted to the dairy herd of
2.8 million cows and their followers, mostly in the tropical lowlands where
Criollo and milked beef cows (about 1.9 million) account for over 50% (about
1.1 million tons) of the milk produced nationwide. Some 900,000 purebred
and crossbre} cows produce the rest in the temperate areas (Table 5). The
hetero-enous composition of the national dairy herd makes average production
per lactation only 917 liters, compared with per lactation production of up
to 2,600 liters from some purebred herds (Table 7).
52.       Irrigation, hay, and silage are used on a very small-scale to help
overcome seasonal variations in climate, and use of concentrate feeds, given
only to 40%( of the best cows in 1973/74, has decreased even further since the
grain prices increased in 1974/75.



ANNEX 1
Page 14
53.       rTational milk production (2 million tons), affected by seasonal
changes, has been inadequate to meet local requirements and it has been
necessary to import powdered milk for reconstitution during periods of
shortage. Some 87% (1.7 million tons) of the milk produced is utilized for
human consumption, which gives a national average per capita consumption of
73.5 kg (75.5 kg per capita in the 13 main towns and only 47.7 per capita in
the rest of the rural areas). Per capita consumption has decreased in the
last few years due to fluctuating seasonal supply and a decrease in the
purchasing power of the lower income people, further aggravated by a price
increase in late 1974.
54.        In October 1974, the Ministry of Agriculture and the representatives
of both processors and producers of milk signed an agreement for the nricing
and distribution of milk for the next four years. Basically, both producers
and processors pay IDETIA one cent (Colombian) per unit of milk (varying from
720 cc to 1,000 cc) produced and processed, and also sell a percentage (revised
periodically up to a maximum of 20%) of total milk production to IDEMA at
reduced prices for distribution at below market price in designated poor areas.
The price established for liquid milk at the processing plant is Col$ 3.60/
liter (US$0.12/liter); however, in practice this price varies in relation to
the farm/plant distance and to the supply/demand situation in the area in
such a way that paid price may stand above or below the established prices.
Milk to the consumer ranges in price from Col$ 4.70 to Col$ 6.00/liter (US$0.16
to 0.20/liter).
55.       Only about 22% of the milk produced is pastei-rized and this is soldl
in 13 main cities. Including the pasteurzing plants, There are 43 processinig
plants which have an estimated unused installed capacity of about 600,000
tons, about 50% of capacity.
Sheep and Goats
56.       The estimated 2 million sheep and goats in the country are princi-
pally in the hands of small and traditional producers such as the campesinos
in the northeast and in the Sierras. Attempts to establish a relatively
modern sheep industry to supply a greater proportion of the national wool
requirements, in addition to meat, have not met with the hoped for degree of
success, mainly because of management, nutritional, and sanitary problems
and failure to provide adequate technical assistance to farmers. However, the
Government is conscious of the development potential for the sheep industry
and estimates that small producers would need credit assistance amounting to
US$0.5 million during 1975, particularly to achieve an increase in production
of wool and reduce present imports of 6,200 tons, valued at about US$8.5
million annually.
57.       The producer is assured of a ready market, at an attractive rate of
return, for any meat or wool produced. At present, the approximate cost of
producing a kilogram of meat is Col$ 9.30 and the Bogota market offers
Col$ 26.00 per kg liveweight. The estimated cost of producing 1 kg of wool
is Col$ 14.30, while that which is not used by the cottage industry and enters
the Bogota market presently finds a ready market at Col$ 32.00 per kg.



ANNEX 1
Page 15
Pigs
58.       According to official estimates, Colombia has about 1.8 million pigs.
In 1974, 67,500 tons of pork were produced, while there was a demand for over
100,0T0 tons. The estimated consumption is about 4 kg per capita, but
unregistered slaughterings may account for an additional 3 kg. About 90% are
in herds of less than 10 animals, owned by small farmers who let them forage
for their food. About 173,000 pigs are managed under more intensive conditions
and these provided the greater portion of the 71,070 tons of pig meat produced
in 1973. It is considered that 500,000 tons of meal containing 15% protein
would be required to adequately feed the present pig population. In view of
the general fee.g zain position, and the necessitv to import, it is not
prudent now to expand the pig population; however, pork production could be
increased through the introduction of higher grade animals for breeding, pens,
and handling facilities to imnrove management in rural areas.
Poultry
59.       The poultry industry has acquired special importance in recent
years through its contribution of eggs and meat to the national diet, thereby
releasing increasing quantities of beef for export. Over the past five years,
poultry meat consumption has doubled, reaching an average of 2.4 kg per capita
in 1974, but increases in egg production have been sufficient only to main-
tain per capita consumption at about 88 eggs per annum. The industry is
generally highly mechanized, with processing plants that utilize by-products
such as blood and feathers and also have ample cold storage facilities. The
National Commission of Agriculture, created in 1970 by Decree 2182, has
overall responsibility for the development of the industry, with sanitation
and disease control delegated to ICA. In 1973, the commercial production of
animal feed concentrates was 726,000 tons, 1/ an estimated 90% of which was
used by the poultry industry. The estimated total requirements for 1975 are
960,000 tons, requiring 480,000 tons of grain and 212,000 tons of sub-products,
much of which will be imported.
Rabbits
60.       Until recently, production remained at the family level.  Of the
present rabbit population of 264,000 an estimated 60% is in commercial
operations of between 20 and 50 breeding females. Production of meat from
these operations in 1974 was estimated at 996 tons for a value of Col$ 27.9
million, while family operations produced 577 tons, valued at ColS 16.2
million. Skins were valued at Col$ 18.6 million, representing about 70%
of the 1.2 million available. Skins presently find a ready market for use
as trim on women's clothing.
1/   An estimated additional 200,000 tons is home-produced.



ANNEX 1

F. Agro-Industries Sub-Sector
Background
61.       Estimates of the size and importance of agro-industry in Colombia
are complicated by the differing definitions of the term "agro-industry" as
understood by various agencies. The primary activity of agro-industry is the
processing of farm products, but some agricultural input industries are often
included, as well as those dealing with distribution, marketing, and storage.
A 1971 Study 1/ based on 1968 census figures showed that agricultural process-
ing industries in Colombia contributed a gross production of US$1 billion, or
43% of the value added by the manufacturing sector. However, when the indus-
tries outside the scope of this appraisal are excluded (coffee and fish pro-
cessing and large-scale agro-industry) these figures (for 1968) must be reduced
by 55%, to US$450 million and 19% of the value added by the manufacturing sector.
62.       Agro-industrial enterprises in Colombia are owned by private sector
companies, "mixed" companies having some Government share capital and Govern-
ment agencies such as Instituto de Mercadeo Agropecuario (IDEMA) which owns
and operates grain storage facilities and cotton gins. Farmer cooperatives
also operate some processing companies.
63.       Processing and storage capacity is not well balanced between regions,
there being evidence of surplus capacity of processing and storage in some
regions and deficits in others. The overall picture is not clear, however,
since determination of "surplus" capacity is complicated by such factors as
age of machinery and availability of working capital. Of the several thousand
enterprises in the Colombian agro-industry sector, the largest and most devel-
oped are sugar mills, vegetable oil plants, dairy plants, animal feed plants,
and maize processing plants.
64.       The technology employed differs greatly.  In grain drying, for
example, all types of systems are in use, from efficient continuous-flow
dryers to inadequate methods of passing heated air through tunnels of wet,
bagged grain. Handling methods rely largely on bagging the product rather
than on bulk shipping. Buildings, in many cases are cheaply constructed, and,
often, consist of merely an asbestos-cement compound roof supported on timber
framing, without walls.
65.       Colombia has considerable capability for manufacturing unsophisti-
cated nrocessing equipment such as rice mills, and these industries will
meet imnortant regional needs in Colombia over the next vears.
Specific Industry Classifications
66.       Cotton Ginning.  The principal credit demand for cotton ginning is
expected to be for replacement and upgrading of worn-out machinery. IDEMA,
which operates 93% of Colombia's cotton ginning capacity, estimates that 10%

Page 17
of their equipment should be replaced annually, and that this amounts to Col $30
million to Col$ 40 million per year. This modernization should provide for project-
ed `.ncreases in cotton production, together with additional warehousing.  How-
ever, seed cotton does not store well, and, in Colombia, 80% is ginned imne-
diately. Therefore, to take care of the projected 15,000 ton (lint equivalent),
per year increase in production machinery replacements should be high speed,
moderate size gins capable of processing eight bales per hour, or up to 2,000
tons per year, taking into account the limited usage due to time of harvest
receipts.
67.       Centrifuged Sugar.  Although the domestic milling margin was nega-
tive in May 1975, this industry is expected to have large demands for credit
over the next three years because of expectations of profitable operations
on exports. Several sources predict an almost 30% expansion of processing
facilities over the next three years, which would amount to between 80,000
and 100,000 tons of sugar per year. Colombia is favored by being one of
the few countries where cane can be cut year rounr.. This means, in terms of
plant capacity able to produce almost 100,000 tons of sugar per year, that a
3,000 ton/day cane intake plant working 300 days per year would suffice.
Such a sugar mill would need the output from approximately 7,500 ha of land
and the cost of such a plant (mid-1975) would be US$28 million, plus a fur-
ther US$2 million for refining equipment.
Panela (Non-centrifuged Sugar). This staple product is widely con-
ad in Colombia, being sold in the form of 500 gram blocks at a retail price
about Col$ 3.00. Production is from thousands of rural mills and the in-
dustry is an important rural employer. No estimates are available for the
value of Colombia's installed capacity of panela mills but the average extrac-
tion rate is only 8% as much of the equipment is old and inefficient. It is
estimated that credit demand to assist in the financing of replacement machinery
would be for about 150 subloans averaging Col$ 300,000 (US$10,000 equivalent)
each over the Project commitment period.
69.       Grain Drying and Storage.  The principal grain crops requiring stor-
age and drying facilities are rice, maize, and sorghum. IDEMA estimates that
of the 2 million tons of these crops currently traded, approximately 30% is
inadequately dried and stored, while provision must also be made for antici-
pated increases in production.
70.       It is estimated that 20 additional well-sited regional storage
facilities (of 2,000-ton capacity--both bagged and bulk product-- and. an es-
timated turnover of six times that tonnage) would be sufficient to dry, store,
and ship grain to terminal storage silos and processors' warehouses. In effect,
these are collecting points, and their economic benefits include (a) reducing
field losses by 10% through drying mechanically instead of fieia drying, (b)
reducing storage losses by 10% through correct handling and temperature and
humidity control, (c) reducing grain breakage--especially with rice--through
proper drying systems, and (d) providing a system of procurement on behalf of
distant processors, without which there might be no adequate,outlets for grain
in some regions and consequent depressed production.

71.       The merchandizing of grain in Colombia is becoming more efficient
,with increasing acceptance by farmers of the practice of bulking grain and
with the inauguration--at the end of 1974--of a grain exchange to buy and sell
futures (in mid-1975, volume was about Col$ 2n million weekly).
72.       Maize Milling.  The market for industrial starch is currently de-
pressed in Colombia because of low demand in the textile industry, but the
market for maize flour is growing rapidly. There are two major uses of maize
flour: (a) pre-cooked flour, mainly sold in 500 g consumer packs but also in
bulk to restaurants and other catering institutions, and (b) substitution of
wheat--up to 30%--in pasta products. National consumption of pre-cooked corn
flour in mid-1975 was 2,200 tons per month and of pasta products, 1,900 tons
per month. Both of these markets depend basically upon the relative price of
maize and wheat, and revocation of the wheat import subsidy in late 1974 caused
consumers to demand more maize-based products. Based upon the above consump-
tion and an estimated rate of growth of 20%, an investment of "S$3.5 million
would be adequate to cater to increased milling demand over the next three
years. The cost of a modern maize milling plant is relatively high, and the
economies of scale are significant, with resultant efficient use of by-products
and production of low unit cost flour in volume.
73.       Rice Milling.  Rice production is growing rapidly in Colombia and is
projected to increase at the rate of 100,000 tons per year over the next three
years. Taking into account the fact that there is little excess milling cap-
acity in Colombia, new investment is projected at US$9 million over the three
years (1976-78). The number of new mills that could be expected to be built
for this investment depends on the capacity of each, but it is estimated that
unit capacity would range between 5,000 tons and 20,000 tons of paddy per year.
The larger units could be expected to have lower operating costs, but local
conditions--with respect to the supply of raw materials as well as markets
available--might make smaller mills appropriate in some regions. Also, de-
pending on international markets, there may be demand for construction of
parboiled rice plants.
74.       Vegetable Oil Milling.  Important oil crops in Colombia include
African Palm, soybeans, and cotton seed, while other oil bearing crops are
corn, rice, sesame, and sorghum. There are large oil mills in Bogota, Medellin,
Barranquilla, and Buga. Taking into account processing capacity installed as
of mid-1975 and projected crop increases, it is estimated that US$5 million of
new investments would be required for the next three years. This would be
equivalent to one new plant of 100,000 tons capacity per year. Because of the
processes involved, the need to obtain high yields of by-products and to
achieve economies of scale, a fu-ll-process vegetable oil mill has to be large
and is a costly installation.  'owever, there is a place for small oil mills
of approximately 15,000 tons per year milling capacity without refining cap-
acity, but with the flexibility to process local surpluses and by-products.



ANNEX 1

75.       Tobacco.  Warehousing, curing, and sorting facilities are more than
sufficient to handle black tobacco production in the vicinity of Golfo de
Morrosquillo, but increasing production of blond tobacco for cigarettes would
need investments of US$10 million over t"e next three years. However, the
maximum aggregate borrowing limit of US$500,000 would place such an investment
outside the scope of the proposed Project.
76.       Sisal Bag Manufacturing.  Transportation in bag is still the most
widely-used system for moving agricultural produce in Colombia, and, while
bulk transport is increasing in importance, demand for bags will continue to
increase over t"e next few years, with production going from an estimated 73
million in 1975 to 88 million in 1977 (annual bag usage is higher because they
are used several times). However, some 38% are polypropylene bags, and, while
Col$ 30 million is projected for their production, no investment is apparently
needed for sisal bag production because the factories are working at only 80%
capacity, which is sufficient to handle projected increases in demand.
77.       Forestry.  Major industries linked to forest exploitation include
pulp and paper, saw mills and timber yards, and wood preserving. Ancillary
industries include the possibilities of producing eucalyptus oil. In recent
years, considerable investment has been made in the pulp and paper industries,
and it is foreseen that new investments would be in smaller industries such
as saw mills and wood preserving plants. A major output of the latter is for
the expanding use of fence posts and electric line poles in rural areas.
78.       Fruits and Vegetables.  Fruit and vegetable production in Colombia
is large in tonnage, land area usage and diversity of species. Most of the
production is consumed in the fresh market and a considerable portion is wasted
and spoiled. Opportunities for commercialization include storage, canning and
exports in frozen form. Storage is particularly needed for potatoes (1974
production, 900,000 tons), where seasonal price movements are severe. There
is a storage facility at Choconta, (near Bogota) but inadequate capacity and
funding and management problems have resulted in its ineffective operation.
79.       Growth of the canning industry in Colombia is inhibited by low con-
sumer purchasing power and year-round availability of fresh produce. A
multi-national company Frutera Colombiana S.A. (FRUCO) processes 15,000
tons of tomatoes per year into ketchup and paste and there have been attempts
by others to grow and can pineapples. As of mid-1975, pineapple commercial-
ization was being investigated by a multi-national firm, but no decision had
been made for implementation. Canned fruit juices for export, especially of
such exotic juices as Curuba, appear to be a possibility.
80.       A good market for frozen fruits and vegetables exists in Venezuela,
Ecuador, Puerto Rico and Caribbean markets as well as others farther away.
Colombia has climatic and labor cost advantages, but exports of fruits and
vegetables are still very low wh-ich may be attributed to a lack of knc4wledge
of the requirements of foreign markets. Exportable products include frozen
blackberries, strawberries, french fried potatoes, asparagus, peas, beets,
carrots, artichokes, onions, and melons.



ANNEX 1
Page 20
81.       Besides the lack of business experience, other handicaps are lack
of a supporting cold storage chain and high transport costs within Colombia.
Nevertheless, it can be expected that the industry will be developed within
the next few years. Investment needs for canning will be large because much
of the product would go to foreign markets and the product would have to meet
export standards. Preferred investments would be in products as listed above
which require a minimum of processing and rely on hand labor. The freezing
plant for such an operation would not be costly, but it must be appreciated
that procurement of sufficient raw materials of good quality could require
more management and investment than would the establishment and tunning of
the plant.
82.       Floriculture.  This industry has successfully exploited the climatic
advantages of the Savanna de Bogota and the ready availability of labor there.
Exports to the U.S. and Europe grew from US$300,000 in 1969 to almost US$16
million in 1974. In mid-1975, the industry worked 200 ha, with an investment
of US$67,000 per ha and employed 10,000 workers. The rate of growth has now
slowed due to marketing difficulties arising from actions by flower producers
in the importing countries and from a need on the part of the Colombian flower
industry to consolidate its financial position after a period of fast growth.
83.       Prepared Animal Feed and Allied Industries.  The annual production
of feed in Colombia is about 900,000 tons with a rate of growth in demand
exceeding 10% per year. Some 85% of this production is consumed by poultry
and the balance by pigs and dairy cattle. Inputs include 450,000 tons of
grain--of which over 75% is sorghum--as well as oil cakes, fish meal, syn-
thetic amino acids, drugs, and *itamins. The feed and poultry industries are
quite concentrated in Colombia, with a few companies dominating each segment,
i.e., feed, eggs, and broilers. Growth of the feed and poultry industries
has been in parallel with the production of grain sorghum, and future projec-
tions for each of these sectors should take this inter-relationship into
account.
84.       There is a place for both large feedmills (100,000 tons per year)
to serve the national market and small mills (7,000 tons -per year or 25 tons
per day). The small mill, serving perhaps one or two poultry plants, may be
built for much less than the large mill, not only because of the relative
capacities, but because the small mill is much less sophisticated. Further-
more, it can compete with the large mills, despite their higher quality prod-
uct, because of lower transportation costs on grain milled and final product
shipped.
85.       Seed Processing.  This industry has the important function of pro-
viding improved seeds to farmers, with resultant higher crop yields. Projec-
tions of increased investment in Colombia must take into account expected in-
creases in crop production, and the regions involved. It should be noted that,
while there is an overall shortage of seed processing capacity in Colombia,
a number of plants are closed or underuLilized due to poor location. The
basic functions of such an enterprise are to: (a) procure quality seed, (b)
clean and dry, (c) sort and grade, and (d) add insecticide and bag. Gross



ANNEX 1
Page 21
margins in this business expressed as a percentage of sales price are good
in Colombia, at 38% for rice, 49% for sorghum, and 30% for sesame at prices
prevailing in mid-1975.
86.       Milk Products.  The main dairy production areas are in Cundinamarca
and Boyaca, while other areas of importance include Valle, Tolima, and Narino.
Production is inhibited by controlled prices. There are 43 processing plants,
and their capacity is thought to be sufficient to meet demand over the next
three years. There is good opportunity to increase the sales of ice cream,
yogurt, and kumis. These products could be sold at popular prices and help
promote improved nutrition. The consumer appeal of ice cream is much higher
than that for some of the fortified foods, for example, Incaparina, which is
a fortified cottonseed-maize meal mixture--now discontinued in Colombia--with
protein quality comparable to milk.
87.       Cold Storage.  Most cold storage capacity in Colombia (5,000 tons
out of a total of 6,000 tons) is associated with meat slaughtering for export.
However, there is (mid-1975) considerable planning in both Government and
private sectors, directed at filling the need for public cold storage facil-
ities, and in the next three years these plans will probably be put into action.
The users of cold storage would be such businesses as (a) food processors that
wished to hold raw, semi-finished, and finished products when seasonal quanti-
ties exceeded their own storage capacity; (b) exporters of frozen fruits and
vegetables; (c) supermarket chains; and (d) provisioners supplying instito-
tional markets (hospitals, schools, and military). The experience of manage-
ment in operating this type of business should be carefully examined in credit
applications since the cost of building cold storage facilities is high and
the credit risk is principally associated with the quality of management.
88.       Meat Packing.  While Colombia has adequate export slaughter capacity,
that for domestic slaughter requires careful consideration. In terms of public
health, the Colombian slaughterhouses are frequently below standard, but up-
grading is more a function of public laws than of commercial advancement.
The popular demand for meat in Colombia is highly price elastic, and it cannot
afford the added value of packaging and processing. Furthermore, tastes are
such that many offals--which would be processed into by-products in some
countries--are consumed directly in Colombia. Provision should be made to
allow for some demand for credit for building municipal slaughterhouses where
present facilities must be relocated for reasons of city congestion and other
exigencies. Such credit applications must be examined with respect to the
proposed fees charged the wholesale butchers to amortize the facility in
relation to the present tariffs.
89.       Other Industries.  Provision should be made for credit demand for
miscellaneous agro-industries, such as tanneries, cassava industrialization,
dehydration plants, and others. Cassava products include flour, starch, and
animal feed, but the fresh price in mid-1975 discouraged the development of
any plans for this, though the price situation might change in the near future.
Several dehydration plants for alfalfa and ramie have recently gone into oper-
ation in Colombia, and the same opportunity exists for cassava to be processed
for the prepared animal feed industry.



ANNEX 1
Page 22
Financing of Agro-indusry
90.       Colombian agro-industry is generallv short of both equity and long-
term loan capital. With respect to equity funds, agro-industry must compete
with more attractive investments in industry and real estate. Agro-industry
needs working capital, frequently exceeding the value of fixed assets (average
is 150% of fixed assets (Table 8).
91.       This situation is aggravated in Colombia by the need on the part of
many processors to store their raw material inputs from harvest time because
of the inadequate public storage facilities, plus a need to extend trade
credit to customers. The effect of shortage of working capital may be that
plants work below capacity, even though unrealized demand may be high for
the product.
92.       Equity financing of agro-industry in Colombia is mostly by company
directors, and few firms have publicly traded stock. Long-term loans are
available from development finance and insurance companies and short-term
loans from commercial banks. Other sources of credit are machinery suppliers
and trade credit on semi-processed materials.
93.       Corporacion Financiera de Fomento Agropecuario y de Exportaciones
(COFIAGRO), a "Sociedad de Economia Mixta", is engaged in investing in and
lending to agro-industries. Equity investments outstanding on December 31,
1974 totalled Col$ 158 million and loans outstanding were Col$ 201 million.
COFIAGPRO's revenues come from dividends it receives on its investments and
in interest on outstanding loans. A principal source of income is its in-
vestment in INGRAL, the meat packing firm in Barranquilla.  CAJA AGRARIA also
lends to agro-industries for both fixed assets and working capital.
94.       The Fondo de Promocion de Exportaciones (PROEXPO) is engaged in
financing export industries. In the case of flower exports, this financing
is 18% funds for six monthls for 80% of the expected value of exports.
Projected Investment
95.       Investment in neTr and expanded agro-industrial enterprises (exclud-
ing coffee and fisheries) in Colombia is projected to exceeci ITSS150 (1975)
million from 1976-1978. The butlk of this projected investment is for staples
(sugar, rice, poultry products, corn flour products), associated inputs (pre-
pared animal feed processing), and service industries (grain storage and drying,
cold storage, seed processing), and some provision has been made for export
products (fruits and vegetables, flowers). About US$93 million is needed for
sugar production alone. These projections are based on stated intentions and
desires of potential investors, supplemented by the opinions of financial or-
ganizations, and correlated with projected increases in agricultural production.
Little provision has been made for discretionary type food products and the



ANNEX 1
Page 23
lack of investor interest in this sub-sector is because of the low popular
ptrchasing power of Colombian consumers.  About US$35 million without or
US$45 million with contingencies of the total projected investment could be
implemented by small companies (defined as having assets of less than Col$ 20
million). Typical project investments are shown in Table 9.
Sub-loan Criteria for Agro-industry
96.       In order for loan funds under the Project to have the maximum
beneficial effect, applications for subloans from agro-industries should
be evaluated in terms of social, economic, and technical criteria.
97.       Social
(a) Size of company applying. In order to foster the development of
small enterprises, financing should focus on enterprises with
assets not exceeding Col$ 20 million. These companies find it
difficult to secure financing, whereas larger companies have
better access to alternative sources of funds.
(b) Contribution to rural income. The impact of a sub-proiect on
improvin- rural inco;:.sc sijould be evaiuated in terms of itc
probable effect on (i) generating emplovment in rFvlation to
caDital cnmmittari- qn4 (;-i  r-        r'ar'-ets an' c'iannels of
distribution through storaae and milling facilities.
(c)  Improvement of the national diet.  Evaluation ill this regard
should consider a sub-project in terms of its probable effect
on improving the national diet:  (i) through reducing the price
of food by projects contributing to more efficient distribution,
or lower cost of production; (ii) through increasing the quantitv
of food available through projects reducing crop wasta-e (e.R.,
storage of grains and vegetables) or enabling better conserva-
tion of nerishables; and (iii) through projects improving the
qualitv (in terms of nourishment) of food.
98.       Economic
(a) Contribution to sectoral bala.nce. For example, development of
the grain sorghum production, prepared animal feed, and Doultrv
Droducts (chickens and egRs) have develoDed in parallel in
Colombia and, it is necessary to consider the input relation-
ships between industries in order to Dromote orderly development.
(b)  Import substitution.  Sub-projects such as those that would make
possible the substituting of corn flour for wheat-flour--should
be accorded Drioritv according to the weight given this factor
by the Colombian government in relation to other factors.



ANNEX 1
Page 24
(c) Ex-ort business. Sub-projects, especially where they exploit
Colombia's comparative advantages, should be given considera-
tion as mentioned in (b).  (For example, the export of
Colombian flowers has denended upon the climatic and labor
availability advantages of the Savanna de Bogota).
(d)  Contribution to efficient land use.  Sub-projects that promote
efficient land use are beneficial to the economy. An example
is reforestation of bare h'll sides and associated agro-
industrial activit-'es.
99.       Commercial and Technical Criteria.  Sub-projects should be evaluated
in terms of their envisioned success as commercial ventures. To do this, it is
recommended that:
(a) Particular attention should be given to the background and ex-
perience of the entrepreneur, and these two elements should
carry equal weight with Planning studies submitted with the
funding aoplication.
(b) A good "business nlan; should be the key component of the
application. It should be specific and comprehensive in its
tdentification of customers and channels of distribution as
%:ell as in justifying exnected prices to 'e paid and received
by the enternrise.
(c)  In the case of small enterDrises, either initiating or expanding
operations, provision should be made for technical assistance--
both business and technical.  Without such services, risk of
failure--e2peciallv during the first one or two years--will be
extremely high.  This is because there is a scarcity of entre-
preneurial talent in Colombia in the industrial field. Ideally,
assistance should commence at the stage of sub-loan application,
with an initial check by an experienced consultant to ensure
that the proposed technology and management is fully in line
with the scale of operations and that the plant will not he over
capitalized, thereby burdening the enterprise with high and in-
flexible fixed costs.
(d) Particular attention should be given to wqorking capital needs,
as the successful performance and operation of small enterprises
in Colombia is frequently handicapped by lack of short term
credit at reasonable interest rates.



ANNEX 1
Page 25
G. Institutions in the Agricultural Sector
100.      The formulation and execution of agricultural policies, programs
and projects in Colombia involves a large number of institutions and organiza-
tions. The following paragraphs provide brief descriptions of those most
relevant to the proposed project.
Entities Involved in Agricultural Policy Formulation
101.      The National Economic and Social Policy Council is a cabinet-level
group which considers overall public policy. Permanent membership comprises
the Ministers of Agriculture, Economic Development, Finance, Foreign Affairs,
Labor and Public Works; the Directors of the National Planning Department
and the Foreign Trade Institute; the Managers of the Bank of the Republic
and the National Federation of Coffee Growers and the Economic Secretary of
the Office of the President of the Republic. Other Ministers and public
officials may attend meetings at the invitation of the President of the
Republic.
102.      The National Agricultural Council is the senior body responsible
for agricultural policy formulation within the framework of overall national
policy. It is headed by the Minister of Agriculture and includes the prin-
cipals of Banco Ganadero, Caja de Credito Agrario, Industrial y Minero,
Federacion National de Cafeteros, Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario, Instituto
Colombiano de la Reforma Agraria, Instituto de Desarrollo de los Recursos
Naturales Renovables and Instituto de Mercadero Agropecuario together with
the Vice Minister and the Secretary General of the Ministry of Agriculture.
103.      The Advisory Council on Agricultural Policy was established under
Law 5 of 1973 to advise the Minister of Agriculture on the requirements of the
agricultural sector and, in particular, on the implementation of Law 5. It
has 14 members comprising the members of the National Agricultural Council
together with a representative of the National Planning Department and six
representatives from crop and livestock producers associations.
Research Technical and Marketing Institutions
104.      The Colombian Institute of Agriculture (ICA) is responsible for (a)
research concerning crop and livestock production; (b) monitoring the produc-
tion and quality of agricultural inputs; (c) registering all private advisors
in the agricultural sector and supervising their technical performance;
(d) training technical and professional personnel in agriculture and related
disciplines; (e) cooperating with other institutions and organizations in
matters of agricultural education; (f) providing advisory services for
small-holders (below 10 ha) who are principally dependent (over 80%) on
farm income. This latter service is becoming an increasingly important part
of ICA's functions occupying some 900 out of its total staff of about 6,000.
Law 5 of 1973 requires that all agricultural loans made to borrowers having
total assets exceeding Col$ 500,000 should be subject to a 1% surcharge which
is allocated to ICA to help finance its advisory service to small farmers.



ANNEX 1
Page 26
104.      The Institute for the Development of Renewable Natural Resources
(INDERENA) is responsible for the administration, conservation and development
of inland and marine fishing, river basins,'national parks, and forests except
where these are within the areas of influence of the Regional Development
Corporations of Magdalena, Sabana de Bogota, Choco, Irasa, Quindio and Coma
Valley. INDERENA supervises the technical performance of private advisors
engaged by investors in forestry and fishing who apply for loans under the
provisions of Law 5.
105.      The Colombian Meteorological and Hydrological Service (SCMH), collates
and publishes meteorological and hydrological records from all parts of Colombia.
However, in many areas the network of stations is sparse and the number of
years for which records have been maintained is limited. This service has
recently been incorporated in the new Colombian Institute of Hydrology,
Metereology and Land Reclamation (HIMAT).
106.      The "Augustin Codazzi" Geographical Institute (IGAC) prepares offi-
cial maps and geographical surveys. The institute is also responsible for
compiling and maintaining the national urban and rural cadastre.  Recent
extensive changes in the taxation system 1/ have made it particularly important
for the cadastral survey to be completed and regularly brought up to date.
107.      The Institute of Technological Research (IIT) carries out agro-
industrial research and development up to the pilot plant stage. It is
closely associated with a program for the production of cheap foods of high
nutritive value for the poorest section of the community.
108.      The Institute for Agricultural Marketing (IDE4A) is responsible for
ensuring the national marketing of farm products. 14here it is not achieved by
the appropriate Federation on Association of Producers, IDEMA purchases, stores,
exports or imports various products to ensure an adequate supply to the domes-
tic market and to regulate the prices received by producers and paid by con-
sumers. IDEMA has a staff of over 3,000 who operate 52 buying centers, seven
mobile purchasing units and 13 grain storage facilities with a total capacity
sufficient to hold 80% of the grain production of 1974.
109.      The Financial Corporation for the Promotion of Agriculture and
Exports (COFIAGRD) invests in, by way of equity participation, and lends to
agro-industries. Equity investments at Decembgr 31, 1974 totalled Col$ 158
million and loans outstanding amounted to Col$ 201 million. COFIAGRO's revenues
come from dividends on equity investments and interest on loans. A principal
source of income is its investment in INGRAL, the meat packing firm in
Barranquilla.
110.      The Fondo de Promocion de Exportaciones (PROEXPO) is engaged in the
promotion and financing of export industries. It is particularly acjive in
the financing of exports of flowers for which it provides six months' credits
at 18% per annum for up to 80% of the value of exports.

May 1975.



ANNEX 1
Page 27
Producers Associations and Federations
111.      Producers of each of the main crop and livestock items are linked in
associations or federations. These often play an important part in shaping
national agricultural policies and the major commodity groups are represented
on one or both of the National Agricultural Council and the Advisory Council
on Agricultural Policy.
112.      The Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia (FEDECAFE) is particu-
larly influential and has been the model followed by other groupings of produ-
cers. FEDECAFE undertakes all coffee research and provides technical assis-
tance, at a nominal charge, for coffee production and processing. It regu-
lates the domestic market and controls the pricing and flow of Colombian
coffee on the world market. Other federations and associations perform
similar functions except that technical research is now carried out exclu-
sively by ICA. A list of the principal associations and federations is given
in Table 10.
H. Technical Assistance and Training
Technical Assistance
113.      An important objective of Law 5 of 1973 was to improve the coordina-
tion, quality and effectiveness of various agencies, firms and individuals
providing technical advice to farmers. The Minister of Agriculture's Decree
No. 235 of 1975 deals in detail with the management and operation of technical
assistance which is now obligatory in association with all credit provided to
the sector under the provisions of Law 5 of 1973. The objectives of the
technical assistance are to assist producers to raise production and yields
by formulation of investment plans, the preparation of loan applications,
guidance on the most efficient use of resources and supervision of the most
appropriate technologies.
114.      There are two main categories of technical assistance in Colombia.
These are:
(a)  Official agencies of which the principal ones are ICA,
INDERENA, CAJA AGRARIA, BANCO GANADERO, and INCORA.
(b)  Non-government entities which include producers associations,
trade suppliers and processors, commercial banks and professional
advisory firms and individuals.
Government Agencies
115.      ICA is responsible for maintaining a register and monitoring the
performance of qualified crop and livestock specialists operating in the
country other than those employed by official agencies. All technical
advisors employed by farmers borrowing under the provisions of Law 5 of
1973 must be on the ICA register.



ANNEX 1
Page 28
116.      ICA is further responsible for ensuring the provision of advisory
services to small farmers (under 10 ha) where this is not provided by other
agencies such as CAJA AGRARIA and INCORA.  This is achieved by group instruc-
tion, the circulation of literature and via the radio. ICA's small farmer
advisory service is partly financed by the proceeds of a 1% surcharge on loans
made under the provisions of Law 5 of 1973 to borrowers having assets (includ-
ing land) in excess of Col$ 500,000. About one-sixth of ICA's staff of over
6,000 is engaged in the small farmer advisory service.
118.      INDERENA is charged, under Law 5 of 1973, with responsibility for
monitoring all technical assistance associated with loans issued under the
provisions of the Law for forestry, wildlife and fisheries development.
119.      CAJA AGRARIA includes a Development Unit responsible for livestock
projects, special crops and forestry development, seed production and rural
housing.  In 1975, the first 3 sections employed about 180 of the total 445
professional staff of CAJA; of these, nearly half were engaged in the imple-
mentation of the livestock project financed in part by Bank loan 651-CO.
120.      The CAJA makes full use of the services of ICA for technical assis-
tance for small-scale farmers and of INDERENA for fishing and forestry projects.
121.      BANCO GANADERO specializes in financing the livestock sub-sector
and its staff in 1975 included 74 veterinarians, 5 zoologists, and 3 agricul-
turalists who were engaged in providing technical assistance to the bank's
borrowers.
122.      INCORA provides technical assistance for farmers within and near
11 migration districts and 11 land settlement or colonization schemes.
In 1975, INCORA had a technical staff of 833 of whom 255 had received full
professional training.
Associations and Federations of Producers
123.      Each Association and Federation listed in Table 10 employs some
extension agents. In most instances the numbers are small but the coffee
growers federation, FEDECAFE, has a coffee extension staff of about 100
professionals and 400 technical assistants while its dependent agency
PRODESARROLLO 1/ has a further 66 professionals and 61 technical assistants.
PRODESARROLLO is responsible, in the coffee growing zones, for providing
technical assistance for all types of agricultural and forestry development
other than coffee.

Banks
124.      Banco Cafetero uses the services of FEDECAFE and PRODESARROLLO staff
to provide technical assistance to its borrowers. Other banks, such as Banco
de Bogota and Banco de Colombia, have small central technical supervisory units
and the banks enter into service contracts with private technical assistance
firms or individuals who, in turn, contract with farmers wishing to obtain
loans from the various banks.
Agriculture Trade Suppliers and Processors
125.      Several agriculture supply firms have their own farm advisory
services but these are normally linked to sales promotion and not to technical
assistance associated with farm credit. Several processing industries, however
- for example, the malt, chocolate, tobacco and canning industries - provide
supervised credit to the producers of their raw materials. The extent of this
type of technical assistance has not been documented but it is important in
localized areas.
Technical Assistance Firms and Individuals
126.      The ICA register indicated that, in 1975, there were about 3,000
professionally qualified Colombians in the private sector of whom about one-
third were working as individual advisors or as members of firms available
to be contracted by financial institutions and farmers. The remaining 2,000
professionally qualified Colombians on the register were not fully engaged
in the professions for which they had been trained.
127.      The following summary is not the result of a detailed study but is
indicative of the numbers and_distribution of personnel engaged in technical
assistance to the sector in 1975:

129.      Since 1960, about 6,400 Colombians have graduated in crop, live-
stock, fishery and forestry sciences and, during the three-year period
1972-1974, an average of 771 new graduates qualified each year.
130.      The National Apprenticeship Service (SENA) provides technical and
vocational training for all sectors of the economy. It has centers through-
out the country for training in the management and operation of farm machinery.
SENA is financed by a compulsory payroll surcharge payable by all employers.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Recent Developments in Agricultural Credit in Colombia
The Banking Framework
1.        The Colombian Government takes an active role in the management and
selective control of credit according to economic sector and purpose. The
M4onetary Board, on which are represented, among others, the Ministry of Agri-
culture and the Banco de la Republica (BOR), is responsible for regulating
the monetary and banking sectors. Policy instruments include a complex of
compulsory investment regimes, special rediscount facilities, reserve require-
ments and control over interest rates paid and charged by the banking sector.
2.        Monetary Board policy is implemented by BOR which is, in effect, the
central bank of the country. BOR, in addition to performing the normal
functions of a central bank, administers the special development funds which
have been set up to channel credit to specific sectors according to Government
priorities.
3.        The major financial intermediaries are the commercial banks, develop-
ment finance companies and two large official specialized banking institutions:
the Caja de Credito Agraria, Industrial y Minero (CAJA AGRARIA) and the Banco
Central Hipotecario (Central Mortgage Bank). CAJA AGRARIA constitutes the
principal source of bank finance for small farmers while the Central Mortgage
Bank is engaged mainly in housing finance. Among the 24 commercial banks in
the country four are semi-official: The Banco Ganadero, the Banco Cafetero,
the Banco Popular and the Banco Estado. The Banco Ganadero (BG), is engaged
principally in livestock finance while the Banco Cafetero (BC) provides
credit to all the major sectors ot the economy including agriculture and live-
stock; however, a substantial portion of its loan portfolio is directed towards
financing of coffee growers.
Agricultural Credit
4.        Institution credit (including INCORA) disbursed to the agricultural
sector during 1974 totalled Col$ 12 billion (US$400 million) and the credit
outstanding to the sector at the end of 1974 was about Col$ 15 billion
(US$500 million) representing about 25% of total institutional credit outstand-
ing. Details of intitutional credit outstanding by economic sectors are
shown in Table I.
5.        With the objective of directing substantially larger credit resources
to the agricultural sector, the Colombian Congress, in March 1973, enacted
Law 5, generally known as Ley Quinta. Under the provisions of Ley Quinta, all



ANNEX 2
Page 2
banks except those whose lending is principally directed to the agricultural
sector; namely CAJA AGRARIA, BG and BC, are required to invest an amount
equivalent to not less than 15% and not more than 25% of their placements
(subject to certain exemptions) in agricultural bonds issued by BOR. The
percentage of investment is determined by the Monetary Board and, since
January 1975, has been set at 17%. The agricultural bonds bear interest at
a rate also established by the Monetary Board and presently 8% per annum.
6.        Funds accruing from the sale of agricultural bonds are used to
finance Fondo Financiero Agropecuario (FFAP) which was established under Ley
Quinta to replace the earlier Fondo Financiero Agricola (FFA). Under FFAP,
rediscounts are made to banks, including those exempted from the compulsory
purchase of agriculture bonds, for short-term, medium-term and long-term loans
to the entire agricultural sector. This contrasts with the rediscount facilities
permitted under FFA which were restricted to short-term crop and livestock
loans.
7.        Rediscount facilities under FFAP are permitted for the following
terms and purposes:
(i) short-term credit (up to two years) for covering the
working capital needs of agricultural production,
cattle breeding and fattening of bovines;
(ii) medium-term credit (for more than two but not exceeding
eight years) for financing depreciable investments,
planting of late-yielding crops and acquisition of
capital goods; and
(iii) long-term credit (for more than eight and not exceeding
15 years) for financing slow maturing investments such
as farm infrastructure.
8.        The administrative regulations issued in August 1973 for the imple-
mentation of Ley Quinta established a complex system of interest rates for the
agricultural sector, ranging from 7 to 18%. The Monetary Board, in their
resolution 57 of 1974, simplified the system and the present rates of interest
charged to borrowers, rediscount rates charged by BOR in respect of rediscounts
under FFAP and the rediscount margins are as follows:

Thle total value of loans approved for rediscount under FFAP in 1974 was
ColS 6,378 million (1.S',213 million).  Short-term credit for crop Droduction
accounted for 52°% of the value of loans approved. These loans, however,
formed 70%/ of the total number of approved loans. Loans for livestock ranked
next in importance, accounting for nearly 33% of the value of approved 1( s.
The operations of FFAP in 1974 were as follows:

1.   Short-term for crop production          16,371        3,323.5    (US$110 million)

9.        The share of major financial intermediaries in the financing of loans
approved under FFAP in 1974 was as follows:

2.   Agriculture and

Commercial banks account for the bulk of loans approved under FFAP.  The share
of the CAJA AGRARIA is less as it had another line of credit with BOR on which
much lower interest is charged. The value of loans approved under FFAP does
not therefore reflect a correct position of CAJA AGRARIA'S lendinig opt-rations
in 1974.
10.       The use of technical assistance for the preparation and implementa-
tion of a borrower's farm investment plan is a pre-condition for rediscount
under FFAP. In fact, each anplication for rediscount with FFAP (for loans
other than for seasonal crops) has to be acconpanied by a farm investment
plan and the contract between the borrower and the professional technical
expert.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Performance Under Previous Agriculture Projects with Credit Components
1.        The Bank has made eight loans to the Republic of Colombia for agri-
cultural development over the last nine years (1966-75), six of which in-
cluded credit for on-farm investments: two were for livestock development
(Loans 448-CO and 651-CO), one was a credit operation (Loan 624-CO), two were
for land colonization (Loans 739-CO and 1118-CO) and one for the completion
of a land drainage system (1163-CO). With the exception of Loan 1118-CO,
which was only signed in May 1975, all the credit components of these loans
have been fully disbursed. None, however, has had a monitoring system to
permit study of the results of investments financed, but the Caja de Credito
Agraria, Industrial y Minero (CAJA AGRARIA), is presently studying the per-
formance of sub-loans made under Loan 448-CO and 651-CO.
Livestock Development Project (Loan 448-CO)
2.        This loan for US$16.7 million supported the first livestock develop-
ment project in Colombia. The executing agency was CAJA AGRARIA and the loan
became effective November 16, 1966. The total cost of the project was esti-
mated at US$28 million, of which US$25 million was expected to be for on-farm
investments; US$1 million for contractors machinery; -US$0.7 million for dairy
cooperatives; and US$1.3 million for hiring four foreign technicians. Finan-
cing was shared by the Bank, 60%; CAJA AGRARIA, 22%; and individual farmers
and cooperative sub-borrowers, 18%.
3.        The project proceeded very well during 1967/68 but progress deter-
iorated rapidly during 1969-71, coming at times almost to a halt. There were
various reasons for this, including lack of support for the project by CAJA
AGRARIA, the poor general investment climate, difficulties with non-Spanish
speaking technicians, shortage of complementary short-term lending funds,
limitation of the project area, rules that did not permit branch offices to
approve sub-loans, and the confining of lending to large ranchers.
4.        Sub-loans were made in specified areas, mainly along the north coast
and the eastern plains for beef production wlhile, those for dairy production
went mostly to the Department of Narino. The possibilities for sheep devel-
opment never attracted much interest and only eight sub-loans were made.
CAJA AGRARIA imported 5,000 sheep under the project, hoping to sell them to
large sheep farmers, but these sales did not materialize. The balance of
funds under this category was therefore cancelled.
5.        At the time of appraisal, it was estimated that 1,175 sub-loans
would be made to livestock producers, 890 of which would be for beef produc-
tion, 250 for milk, and 35 for sheep. In actual performance, however, some



ANNEX 3
Page 2
1,000 sub-loans were made, about 880 of which were for beef, eight for sheep,
and the remainder for dairy. No sub-loans were made to machinery contractors.
Disbursements, showing the distribution of funds among the project categories,
expected and actual, are shown below:

Second Livestock Development Project (Loan 651-CO)
6.        Initial progress in the first Livestock Development Project (para 3)
led to early appraisal of a second project, for which a loan for US$18.3 mil-
lion was signed on December 29, 1969. It did not become effective, however,
until March 19, 1971, mainly because of the slowdown in the first project.
The second project was similar to and in continuation of Loan 448-CO, finan-
cing investments for beef, dairy and sheep production, and technical assistance.
7.        Progress was very disappointing during 1971/72 but accelerated
rapidly during 1973/74 following changes recommended by a Bank supervision
mission. The project area was extended to cover the entire country, CAJA
AGRARIA agreed to supply the necessary short-term loan funds, reorganize its
project administration, and lending terms were altered. Technical appraisal
and supervision of sub-loans was good, but CAJA AGRARIA did not, initially,
apply appropriate financial analysis criteria to proposed farm investment
plans. However, this shortcoming was rectified towards the end of project
disbursements at the urging of Bank supervision missions.
8.        At appraisal it was estimated that 970 sub-loans would be made, 700
of which were expected to be for beef, 250 for dairy and 20 for sheep produc-
tion. Actually, CAJA AGRARIA made 1,445 sub-loans to beef and dairy farmers
and none to sheep producers. A comparison of actual disbursements with ex-
pected performance is shown below:

Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 624-CO)
9.         The loan for US$17 million supported the first agricultural credit
project.  The Instituto Colombiano de la Reforma Agraria (INCORA) was the
executing agency, using CAJA AGRARIA and three commercial banks (Banco de
Colombia, Banco Cafetero and Banco de Sogota) to disburse sub-loans.  The
project area was initially  confined to two regions (Valle and Tolima), and
lending was, from 1970 to 1972, limited to farmers with 10 to 100 ha. Farmers
received sub-loans for short-term seasonal production costs, machinery, and
on-farm improvements, mainly for irrigation and drainage and machinery con-
tractors received sub-loans for machinery purchase.  A team of INCORA farm
planners prepared and closely supervised farm plans.
10.        During the first three years (1970-72), progress was very disappoint-
ing. INCORA showed only half-hearted interest since the project did not in-
volve small farmers (less than 10 ha) who had received land from INCORA under
the land reform Drograms. This was because the Government had requested that
these farm.ers be excluded to ensure USAID had financed a special supervised
credit program for them. Also, INCORA allocated insufficient staff to run
the project and did not have enough funds to cover its contribution to sub-
loans since the Government was not providing resources for such a purpose.
11.        At the end of three years of effectiveness, only USS2 million had
been disbursed from the Bank loan for the credit program and another US$1
million was used for a feasibility study.  However, in early 1973, INCORA
agreed to increase its field staff and give full support to the project in
general; the Government provided funds; and the Bank agreed to enlarge the
project area and include farmers with less than 10 ha as project beneficiaries.
As a result, activity speeded up and the remaining US$14 million was disbursed
in 18 months.
12.        The impact of the project is difficult to measure, but agricultural
production in the area increased considerably during the Deriod of project
lending, mainly as a result of three activities: first, the project provided
additional short-term lendina ftnds, which made it Dossible for farmers to
purchase sufficient amounts of fertilizers and other seasonal requirements;
second, the project financed farm machinery essential for the type of inten-
sive apriculture now Prevailing in the Project areas: and, third, the project



ANNEX 3
Page 4
financed on-farm irrigation and drainage investments, including flood protec-
tion, which offered immediate as well as long-lasting benefits.
13.       At appraisal, it was estimated that about 2,500 farmers and con-
tractors would benefit from the project. Actually, however, 3,500 participated
and about 4.400 sub-loans were made since several sub-borrowers received more
than one sub-loan. By mid-1975, the project sub-loan portfolio amounted to
about Col$ 300 million, or US$10 million equivalent. Using funds collected
from farmers repayments, about 55 project technicians continue making new
sub-loans. Thus, since the proposed second credit project is expected to
become effective during 1976, there should be no interruption in lending
operations.
14.       At appraisal, it was estimated that US$5.5 million of the Bank loan
would be used for short-term credit; US$5.3 million for machinery; US$3.1 mil-
lion for on-farm investments; US$0.7 million for technical assistance, includ-
ing transport facilities; and US$0.9 million for a feasibility study; US$1.5
million was unallocated. The table below shows that machinery investments
were in fact higher than estimated during appraisal, while on-farm drainage
and irrigation investments, although gaining momentum at the latter part of
the project, were less than appraisal estimates:

queta Land Colonization Projsct (Phase I) (Loan 739-CO)
15.       The loan signed in May 1971 and effective in September of that year,
was for US$8.1 to help finance a colonization project in the Caqueta area of
the Amazon River Basin. Total cost of the project was estimated at US$21.6,
including US$3.7 millon for a farm credit program. INCORA is responsible
for project execution. Elements of the project area long-term credit program
for livestock; a cattle fattening program; construction of roads, schools,
and health centers: and improvement of INCORA's local administration.
16.       Physical objectives of the project were reduced to 70% of appraisal
estimates as a result of a study made by the Bank in 1973 of cost increases

and implementation problems. The revised goals called for 1,600 farm loans
for breeding cattle, 270 loans for fattening cattle, and construction of 200
km of roads, six health centers and 60 schools, and, in view of the 14-month
extension of the legal closing date - from April 30, 1975 to June 30, 1976-
realization of these goals seems reasonably well assured. Actually, the re-
vised goal for breeding cattle has been exceeded, with 1,887 sub-loans having
been made in that category as of June 30, 1975, benefitting some 1,658 families
in the project area, while 141 sub-loans have been made for fattening cattle
compared with a revised estimate of 270.
17.       Disbursements as of Julv 18, 1973 were US$7.5 million, and will be
fullv disbursed bv the end of 1976.
Cagueta Rural Settlement Project (Phase II) (Loan 1118-CO)
18.       This project, supported by a loan of US$19.5 million signed in June
1975, is a continuation of the ongoing Caqueta Land Colonization Project
(Phase I). About 2,850 small farms will receive credit under this loan, which
also financed construction of roads; improvement of social services; environ-
mental protection, technical assistance and training; and further strengthen-
ing of INCORA's project administration. The loan became effective in April
1976.
Cordoba 2 Agricultural Development Project (Loan 1163-CO)
19.       The project includes rehabilitation and completion of the drainage
system on 40,000 ha, on-farm development on 20,000 ha; medium- and long-term
credit to small farmers for farm development, machinery, and the purchase of
livestock; formation of an extension service; consultant services for farm
development and extension training and a program to improve social infrastruc-
ture for schools, health services, village water supply, rural electrification
and communication systems. The loan for US$21.0 million was signed at the end
of 1975 and became effective in April 1976.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Crop Models
Land Developmc.at for Seasonal Crops
1.        Annual Crop Development of a 10-ha Crop Farm.  This is a 10-ha farm on
whi-ch 3 ha was under flood irrigation for rice production before the Project
although half of the area irrigated was not completely levelled. The balance
of the farm area was utilized as follows: 2 ha of food crops for subsistence
and house area, 3 ha of poor quality grassland, and 2 ha of unused scrub or
forestland.
2.        Investments under the Project would:
(a)  clear all the scrub and forest (2 ha);
(b)  level half of the existing irrigated area (1.5 ha), all the
grassland area (3 ha) and three-quarters of the former scrub
and forestland (1.5 ha); total area improved, 6 ha;
(c)  prepare tertiary irrigation and drainage ditches for the
former area of Qrassland (3 ha) and three-quarters of the
former scrub and forestland (1.5 ha); total area improved,
4.5 ha;
(d)  prepare drainage ditches in one-quarter of former forest area
which is unsuitable for flood irrigation (0.5 ha); and
(e)  nurchase and install sDrinkler irrigation equipment for the
area described in (d) above (0.5 ha).
3.        As a result of these investments, totalling ColS 74,000 (US$2,500
equivalent), there would be 7.5 lha under flood irrigation, 0.5 ha under
sprinkler irrigation, and 2 ha for food crops for subsistence and house area.
4.        The sub-borrower would require a sub-loan of less than Col$ 120,000
(US$4,000 equivalent) for investment, and, unless his total assets exceeded
ColS 500,000 (USS16,667 equivalent), would contribute only 157, of the
investment costs and would not be required to pay for technical assistance.
The subloan would therefore be for Col$ 62,600 (USS2,100 equivalent).
5.        Annual Crop Dv_ loepment of a  20-ha Crop Farm.  This is a 120-ha farm
operated either as (a) an individual unit, or(b)by12 families as a group
farm. In each case, the initial position would be that 40 was under dryland
farming producing sorghum in the first semester and cotton in the second.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
House and food crops for subsistence would occupy 15 ha; poor quality grassland,
30 ha; and scrub and forest, the remaining 35 ha.
6.        Investments under the Project would:
(a) clear 20 ha of the unused scrub and forest;
(b) level the existing arable land (40 ha) and the newly cleared
land (20 ha); total area improved, 60 ha;
(c) prepare tertiary irrigation and drainage ditches for all the
area described in (b) above (60 ha);
(d) purchase one tractor with a complete set of implements; (one
tractor per 60 ha cultivation per semester); and
(e) contribute one-quarter to the cost of purchasing (one combine
harvester to be shared between four similar farms; one combine
per 240 ha to be harvested each semester).
7.        As a result of the investments, totalling Col$ 1,545,000 (US$51,500
equivalent), there would be 60 ha under flood irrigation; house sites and
food crops would occupy 15 ha: poor quality grassland, 30 ha; and scrub and
forest, the remaining 15 ha.
(a) A farmer operating a farm of this size individually would be
required to pay for technical assistance, which would cost 2%
of the total investment value, and to contribute 25% of the
total cost of investment and technical assistance (Col$
1,576,000 (USS2,500 equivalent). In this case, the sub-loan
would be Col$ 1,182,000 (US$39,400 equiva.lent);
(b)  If the farm were jointlv operated by 12 families, the sub-loan
requirement per family would be less than Col$ 120,000
(US$4,000 equivalent). The group would contribute only 15%
of the investment costs, totalling Col$ 1,545,000 (US$1,500
equivalent), and would not be required to pay for technical
assistance. The sub-loan would therefore be for Col$ 1,313,000
(US$43,800 equivalent), or Col$ 109,400 per family (US$3,650 per
family).
Medium and Long-term Crops
8.        Perennial Crop Development of a 30-ha Crop Farm.  This is a 30-ha
farm on which 10 ha was devoted to sugarcane grown for the production of
"oanela" (non-centrifuged sugar) under a low level of management. Of the
remaining 20 ha, buildings and food crops for subsistence occupied 5 ha and
15 ha were poor quality grasslands.

9.        The investment program would establish 10 ha of cocoa and maintain
it for two years and 5 ha of plantains, and replant 10 ha of sugarcane in
three years in the following sequence:
Year 1
Cocoa interplanted with plantains on                            5 ha
Plantains alone planted on                                      5 ha
Year 2
Cocoa interplanted with plantains on                            5 ha
Cocoa interplanted with plantains maintained on                 5 ha
Cocoa processing facilities constructed for                     5 ha
Sugarcane planted on                                            5 ha
Cane processing facilities constructed for                     10 ha
Year 3
Cocoa interplanted with plantains maintained on                 5 ha
Cocoa processing facilities constructed for                     5 ha
Sugarcane planted on                                            5 ha
Maintenance of plantains and sugarcane from the second year and cocoa from the
third year from planting is to be covered by seasonal short-term credit.
10.       The cost of the investments would amount to Col$ 495,000 (US$16,500
equivalent). The borrower would be required to contract for technical assist-
ance services costing about 2% of the investment value and contribute 25% to
the total costs of investment and technical assistance. The sub-loan would
therefore be for Col$ 371,000 (US$12,400 equivalent).
11.       Perennial Crop Development (Citrus) of a 10-ha Crop Farm.  This is
a 10-ha farm on which 3.5 ha of coffee provided the principal source of
income. Seasonal crops and the house site occupied 1.5 ha and the balance of
5 ha was of poor quality grassland.
12.       The investment program would establish and maintain for three years
5 ha of citrus in place of the grassland. Maize would be interplanted in the
citrus for three seasons of the first two years.
13.       The total investment would be Col$ 88,000 (US$2,900 equivalent) to
which the borrower would be required to contribute 15%. No charge would be
made for technical assistance. The sub-loan would be for Col$ 75,000 (US$2,500
equivalent).
14.       Loan terms assumed in the model are as follows:  amortization for
citrus planting and two years maintenance, 10 years, with five years' grace,
18Z interest, and a 1% compulsory life insurance premium.

Livestock Models
40-ha Dual-Purpose Cattle Farm
1.        This is a 40-ha dual-purpose farm (milk and beef production), which
might be situated in the Caribbean flatlands or in the Andean foothills. It
has 25 ha of pasture and 35 head of cattle, with a herd composition and stock-
ing rate (1.16 animal units per ha) close to the national average for this
kind of farm. The cattle are mostly "criollo", upgraded with Zebu and some
European breeds; the cows are milked and steers are sold for slaughter at an
advanced age (over 36 months).
2.        Investments under the Project would:
(a) clear bushes and forest and plant 15 ha of new pasture;
(b) construct 1.3 km of new fences to divide large pastures;
(c) build water facilities for the new pastures;
(d) provide six mineral troughs and repair the milking shed;
(e) purchase equipment for forage conservation; an
(f) purchase one bull and four heifers.
3.        As a result of these investments, totalling Col$ 120,000 (US$4,000
equivalent), the farm would be completely developed on smaller paddocks, which
facilitates management and improves efficiency of production. The herd would
increase up to 59 head of cattle at full development. The farmer would con-
tribute 15% of the investments cost and would get a loan for Col$ 102,000
(US$3,400 equivalent) to be repaid in nine years, with four years of grace.
60-ha Dairy Farm
4.        This is a specialized 60-ha dairy farm, which might be located in
the inter-Andean valleys or in the highlands. The 60 ha are in pasture of
poor and fair quality, and the herd, 24 lactating cows and their followers
(total 73 head), are specialized dairy breeds, Holsteins or Normandy, with
a good genetical potential.
5.        Investments under the Project would:
(a) replace 30 ha of the poorer pasture land with good grass-
legume association and improve the remaining 30 ha by
planting legumes, fertilizing and weeding;

(b)  repair 1 km of existing fencing and to construct an addi-
tional 3 km to divide the pasture land in very small paddocks
for an intensive grazing rotation;
(c) provide water supply for the paddock;
(d) repair the milk shed, pave the waiting patio and con-
struct 1 km of roads;
(e) purchase machinery and equipment for forage conservation
and milk handling; and
(f) purchase two bulls and 10 heifers.
6.        As a result of investments, totalling Col$ 520,000 (about
US$17,530 equivalent), the farm would improve its management and production,
increasing the herd up to 44 lactating cows per year at full development of
the Project. The farmer would contribute 25% of the investment costs and
would get a loan for Col$ 390,000 (US$13,000 equivalent) to be repaid in
eight years, with a grace period of three years.
2,000-ha Beef Ranch
7.        This is a 2000-ha beef ranch situated in the Orinoco or Amazonas
basin prairies, mostly on natural grassland. The herd, 400 head of cattle,
has very low productivity and is handled in an extensive way.
8.        Investments under the Project would:
(a) plant 120 ha of improved pasture to be used as a maternity
and hospital area and for finishing steers and cull cows and
bulls;
(b) build 10 km of new fences, mainly peripheral and repair
5.6 km of fencing;
(c) construct six water tanks;
(d) construct 20 mineral troughs, two corrals and one spray race; and
(e) purchase five Zebu bulls and 50 heifers.
9.        Total investment would amount to Col$ I million (about US$33,300
equivalent), permitting the herd to increase to 700 head and triple the
number to be sold per year. Farmers' contribution to investments would be
25% and the loan, Col$ 750,000, would be repaid in 12 years, with five years
of grace.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Agro-Industry Models
1.        The two models presented are the simplest and most economical plants
to do the job, bearing in mind that the operators would be small businessmen
with little capital.
Grain Drying and Storage
2.        This model illustrates the type of regional storage farilitv which
is required in Colombia to collect and condition grains and ship them to
terminal warehouse facilities. The business function of the regional storage
facility is to work for the account of the farmer or processor--usually it is
the latter--because Colombian law does not allow storage operators to finance
grain holdings through warehouse receipts. In this example, the storage func-
tion is secondary to procurement, conditioning, and expediting of grain to
metropolitan or processors' storage facilities.  Fees will be derived from
services rendered--chiefly to processors--and the latter will advance monies
for working capital. These services can include procurement, grading, cleaning,
drying, storage, fumigation, weight and volume control, and shipping.
3.        It is assumed that the following grains are grown within a 20-mile
radius of the storage facility: (i) irrigated rice harvested in January and
July, (ii) irrigated maize harvested in June and December, and (iii) rainfed
grain sorghum harvested in December. The assumptions made with respect to
the amount of these grains going to the model will determine the overall and
peak capacities to be provided for. These assumptions are that 700 ha of
each crop will move through the facility, i.e., 7,000 tons of rice (yield of
10 tons/ha), 3,500 tons of maize (yield of 5 tons/ha), and 2,100 tons of
grain sorghum (yield of 3 tons/ha).
Small Feed Mill
4.        This is a simple feed mill, consisting basicallv of a mixer and a
hammer mill, with no pellet mill. Capacity is 25 tons/day. In this example,
the mill sells its output to an egg plant feeding 100,000 laying hens and
35,000 chicks. The ratio is 0.174 kg per laying hen and the conversion rate
is 1.8 kg of feed per one dozen eggs. The ratio is based on grain sorghum
(47%), cottonseed meal (33%), rice bran (11%), fish meal (6%), and minerals

(3%). Drugs and synthetic amino acids should preferably be added, as well
as vitamin A, which grain sorghum lacks. This ration can be varied in com-
position, depending on least-cost formulas. Sorghum and maize are of approxi-
mately equal nutritional value, but sorghum is cheaper than maize (mid-1975).
Summary
5.        Major differences in the models are (a) working capital requirements --
the grain storage facility does not buy and sell for its own account, whereas
the feed mill must buy its raw materials twice a year, at harvest time, ne-
cessitating relatively large working capital requirements; and (b) the ratio
of sales to investment differs between the models because the grain storage
facility revenues are based on fees, which are only a percentage of the
total value of the grain handled.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.        The economic rate of return of the Project was calculated on the
basis of models given in Annexes 4 to 6. Key computations and adjustments
were as follows:
(a) the prices of investment and operating cost items in constant
December 1975 prices were assumed to remain unchanged throughout the
life of the Project, except for the price of fertilizer, which
was assumed to follow the projections given by the Bank's
Economic Analysis and Projections Department;
(b) the prices for beef, cotton, rice, soybeans, sugarcane, maize,
sorghum and cocoa were assumed to follow the projections of
the Bank's Economic Analysis and Projections Department. After
calculating the equivalent FOB or CIF prices, allowances were
made for local port expenses, transportation costs within
Colombia, and processing costs to arrive at the economic farm-
gate prices. For milk, citrus, plantain, and tomatoes, farmgate
prices as used in the financial analysis were taken as the basis
for economic farmgate prices. It was assumed that these prices
would follow the general inflation, which means that, in 1975
constant terms, would not change. The incremental beef, cotton,
and rice production is used for exports, and production of other
products financed under the Project is used to supply the expand-
ing domestic market.
(c) incremental herd values were credit to the project at the end
of the life of the investments (in 20 years see (h) below);
(d) administrative and technical services provided to sub-borrowers
to prepare investment plans were charged to the Project;
(e) since taxes and tariffs are transfer payments within the economy,
benefits and costs were adjusted to compensate for them. These
taxes and tariffs are the presumptive income tax for farmers,
which increases progressively with the presumptive farm income;
the capital gains tax for agro-industry is 20%; sales tax, 6%;
and import duty for agro-industry, 10%;



ANNEX 10
(f)  the Government policy to subsidize exports and impose controls,
combined with high taxes on imports results in an effective exchange
rate higher than the official one. On the basis of tariffs, subsi-
dies and trade, a shadow exchange rate of tile U.S. dollar 19.7%
higher than the official rate was calculated and used in the sensitivity
analysis. This adjustment offsets the existing export subsidy and is
considered conservative. Consequently, an exchange rate of Col$ 35.9
per U.S. dollar has been used to convert foreign currency into local
cjrrency in the computation of costs and benefits for the economic
analysis;
(g)  financial wages on ranches have been taken to eniual shadow wage
rates for the base estimate since unemployment is considered to
be low during land preparation and harvest time; and
(h)  in the economic analysis, the project life has been taken as
20 years for the livestock and crop component and 10 years for
the agro-industry component.
2.        The economic rate of return under these and alternative assumptions
are shown below:

2/ Because of the difficulties Colombia has been experiencing exporting beef, it was assumed
that price increase for Colombian beef would only be half as much as for
Argentine beef (EAPD - Projection).  Base beef price (1975) for Economic
Analysis are the same as for Financial Analysis for the same reason.
