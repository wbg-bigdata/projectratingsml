SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT (LOAN 1357-CO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (POR) of the Second
Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1357-CO). The total loan amount was
US$64.0 mzllion, as approved by the Board on December 28, 1976. The Loan and
Guarantee Agreements were signed on February 4, 1977. The total loan amount
was fully disbursed, with final disbursement on January 7, 1985.
The PCR was prepared by the Latin America and Caribbean Regional
Office, after a visit to Colombia in January 1985. The PCR is based on a
project completion report prepared by the Borrower, and draws on the
Appraisal Report (No. 1248-CO), 4sted November 15, 1976, the President's
Report (No. P-1961-CO) of DecembeT 16, 1976, and the Loan and Guarantee
Agreements. The minutes of the Board presentation, supervision reports,
correspondence with the Borrower and internal Bank memoranda on project
implementation were also reviewed. Finally, interviews were held with Bank
staff associated with the project.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments.
Comments received have been incorporated and are attached as Annex Dr
This project has not been subjected to an audit by OED.

COLOMBIA
SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT (Loan 1357-CO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
This was the ninth IBRD-supported project for agricultural
development in Colombia since 1966. The eighth previous loans totalled
US$114.6 million, of which five were smallholder oriented while the other
three supported credit programs for livestock ranchers and crop farmers
(para. 2.01). This project was production oriented and out of the total loan
amount (US$64.0 million), about 251 was earmarked for lending to small
farmers (para. 4.12).
Objectives
The objectives of the project were to assist the Government of
Colombia in expanding food production and in increasing the agricultural
sector's contribution to the rest of the economy in terms of balance of pay-
ments, value added and employment creation (para. 3.06). These objectives
were to be accomplished through a line of credit to support on-farm and agro-
industrial development. The project was to be administered by the Banco de
la Republica (BOR) and implemented through BOR's development funds for
agriculture (FFAP) and industry (FFI and FIP); credit would be chanelled to
beneficiaries through financial intermtdiaries.  This was the Bank's first
opportunity to become directly involved with FFAP (para. 2.02).
Implementation Experience
Project completion was delayed by two years (para. 4.02). Delays
in implementation were partly due to changes in regulations governing
interest rates. Partly however, they were due to problems related to proce-
dures for lending to small farmers (para. 4.09). Caja Agraria, one of the
major public sector banks, had experience with lending to small farmers, but
did not have access to FFAP rediscounting because its technical assistance
was not of a high enough level to meet FFAP requirements. Moreover, Caja
Agraria had difficulty in making long-term loans to farmers without adequate
guarantees. A scheme to allow lending to small farmers was devised in the
face of these difficulties and turned out to be one of the positive aspects
of the project: amallholders have gained access to FPAP rediscounting, and
this is now a permanent feature of FF#" lending (para. 4,11).
In connection with the difficulties mentioned in the preceding
paragraph, two points are of interest:



(a) the concern expressed by several Directors during Board presenta-
tion (para. 3.05) regarding interest rates, the level of inflation,
and the possibility of substitution/diversion of funds, was proven
correct (para. 4.06); and
(b) despite the implementation delays, the Bank's initiative in
earmarking 25% of the loan proceeds for small farmers was nonethe-
less timely and constructive, because it gave these farmers access
not only to Bank funds, but more generally to FFAP financing
(para. 4.11).
Results
The project's targets and objectives were met (paras. 5.07-5.09)
and the institutions responsible 'or the day-to-day operation of the project
performed satisfactorily (para. 6.01). In particular, the estimated
distzibution between subborrowers (small farmers and medium- and large-scale
farmers), between subsectors (agriculture and livestock), and between
components (agriculture and agro-industries) was achieved, and targets for
the numbers of beneficiaries and amount of subloane were largely met (para.
4.12). However, because no monitoring and evaluation system was established
under the project, the impact of the project is not precisely known (para.
4.20(a). Two sample surveys-on livestock development subloans for small
farmers and agro-industry subloans--give some indication of improvements
achieved through project lending, particularly the creation of employment
opportunities above the appraisal estimate. Technical improvements in
livestock farming have helped to achieve at least a threefold increase in the
production of milk and meat on the farms surveyed. Most of the
agro-industrial enterprises surveyed have increased their production and 75%
exceeded their projected increase in sales (para. 5.03-5.13).
Sustainability
The prospect for sustainability of benefits from BOR's development
funds for agriculture and industry appear uncertain at this stage. Credit
activities are expected to continue at a slower rate utilizing the recovery
of this and other project credit funds. However, there is a concern of
possible shortage of BOR's lines of credit. In order to support follow-up
projects for on-farm and agroindustrial development in the country, BOR would
need additional local or external funds. The Bank may play an important role
financing future BOR projects.
Findings and Lessons
Based on the difficulties encountered during project implementa-
tion, the following lessons (paras. 8.01-8.02) should be reflected in future
project objectives, design, and supervision:



.. vi -
(a) attempts to tackle macroeconomic issues (such as interest rate
policy) should not depend solely on relatively small projects, but
should also be pursued in a broader context such as policy-based
sector loans. This project attempted to deal with the interest
rate issue through BOR. However, interest rates are regulated by
the Monetary Board, and BOR is one of several institutions repre-
sented on the Board. A dialogue with all institutions involved in
regulating interest rates, based on a comprehensive knowledge of
both the agricultural and financial sectors, could make progress in
achieving a desirable interest rate policy;
(b) key policies and procedures for project implementation - in this
case for lending to small farmers - should be established and
agreed with tne Borrower prior to loan approval; and
(c) designing effective monitoring and evaluation systems should be an
integral part of project preparation, and obtaining the full
support of the implementing agencies is essential for success.
Furthermore, the inherent difficultiea in evaluating broad-based
credit operations should be kept in mind.



COLOMBIA
SECOND AGRICUL!URAL CREDIT PROJECT (Loan 1357-CO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Agriculture is a key sector in the Colombian economy.  From 1971 to
1975, agricultural output grew at an average of 4.6% p.a. in real terms. In
1975, the sector contributed 27% of GDP and 59% of the value of all exports
of goods and services. With the exception of wheat, cocoa, oilseeds and
pulses, Colombia was self-sufficient in food. Coffee is the main agricul-
tural export, providing about 62% of total agricultural exports and about 44%
of total merchandise export value; other important exports were sugar,
cotton, rice and bananas. Processing of agricultural production has
traditionally been limited to sugarcane processing plants, cotton gins, rice
and wheat mills, and oil extraction plants, with very few plants handling
milk, vegetables and fruit processing.
1.02      In the mid-1970s, 9 million people (37% of the total estimated
population of 24.5 million) lived in rural areas, and the agricultural sector
supported 37% of a total labor force of about 7 million. However, most of
the rural population lived in poverty due mainly to: poor distribution of
land, associated with a high concentration of small farmers on poor soils;
lack of coordinated production support services; and very poor physical
infrastructure and social services.
1.03      The Government's principal objectives in the agricultural sector
were to increase production as rapidly as possible, while raising nutritional
standards and improving income distribution. The main strategies for
achieving these objectives involved an integrated rural development program,
backed by investment in research and the adaptation of new varieties for
production on small farms, and a national agricultural credit program that
gave high priority to the production of cereals, legumes, starch crops, and
animal products. Priority was to be given to investment in agro-industries
and to the development and marketing of fishery products.
II. BACKGROUND
2.01      Between 1966 and 1976, when the Second Agricultural Credit Project
was presented to the Board, the Bank approved eight loans for agricultural
development, for a total of IJS$114.6 million. Five projects helped finance
land development and settlement, while the other three supported credit
programs for livestock ranchers (Loans 448-CO of 1966 and 651-CO of 1969,
which provided funds through Caja Agraria) and crop farmers (Loan 624-CO of
1969, which provided funds through the Colombian Institute for Agrarian
Reform, INCORA). With the approaching completion of the commitment periods
of Loans 624-CO and 651-CO in 1975, discussion of projects to continue
support for these two separate credit programs led ultimately to the concep-
tion of a single project.



-2-
2.02      The project was to be administered by the Central Bank (BOR). 1t
To provide affordable credit to priority sectors as an incentive to
investment,the Government had already established three financial funds in
BOR: FFAP (Fondo Financiero Agropecuario) dealing with agriculture, and FFI
(Fondo Financiero Industrial) and FIP (Fondo de Inversiones Privadas) dealing
with industry and administered by DCF (Departamento de Credito de Fomento).
These funds provided rediscount facilities to commercial banks and other
financial institutions for loans granted to farmers and farmer groups
involved in agriculture and/or agro-industries, and to industrial
enterprises. The interest rates on loans eligible for rediscounting were
substantially lower than the prevailing interest rates of the financial
markets and gave a rediscounting spread of about four points 1/. The rates
are established by the Monetary Board (Junta Monetaria), which is chaired by
the Minister of Finance and includes representatives of BOR and the Ministry
of Agriculture as members.
III.  PROJECT FORMULATION
A. Preparation and Appraisal
3.01      in early 1975, the Gover.ament of Colombia requested a Bank loan to
help finance a three-year lending program for medium- and long-term invest-
ments in agriculture (including livestock) by commercial farmers and
machinery contractors, and in related agro-industries. The project was
prepared by various official entities in Colombia under the guidance and
coordination of BOR, and with the assistance of a Bank/FAO Cooperative
Program mission that visited the country in November/December 1974. The
project was appraised in April/May 1975.
B. Negotiations and Board Approval
3.02      Negotiations began in Bogota under the direction of the Resident
Mission in February 1976, but were prolonged by difficulty in resolving the
interest rate issue. At the time of appraisal, FFAP rediscounted loans to
farmers carried rates of 15-20% and commercial bank loans financed from their
own resources, 25-30%; however, with inflation running at over 20%, FFAP's
rates were negative in real terms. Prior to negotiations, however, the
Government raised the ceiling on commercial bank loans financed from their
own resources to 28-32% (giving an effective interest rate of 35%). To
ensure positive interest rates and avoid substitution under the proposed
project, the Bank proposed an effective interest rate of 24% for both
agricultural and agro-industry subloans.
3.03      During negotiations in February 1976, the Colombian representatives
agreed to raise the issue of changing FFAP's interest rate with the Monetary
Board in early March 1976. No action was taken, however, and in April 1976,
in an effort to complete negotiations, the Bank proposed an effective
interest rate of 21% p.a. for agricultural lending. In May 1976, however,
the Bank was informed that the Monetary Board had decided to make no change
1/ See also comments from the BOR's Assistant Credit Manager in Annex D.



- 3 -
in FFAP's interest rates. During subsequent negotiations over five months,
the Bank proposed alternatives such as disbursing Bank funds through an
entity other than FFAP; none was acceptable to the Government.
3.04      in October 1976, the Bank accepted the Government's position that
disbursement must be through FFAP on its prevailing terms and conditions.
However, it proposed a yearly review of interest rates in the light of
changiag economic conditions, and in case of disagreement between the Bank
and the Government as a result of this review, the Bank could stop disburse-
ments until agreement was reached. The final wording of the legal covenant
was that the review could be held at the request of the Guarantor, the Bank
or the Borrower (Loan Agreement, Section 3.04). The Bank's remedy of
stopping disbursements was maintained. Schedule 5 on Lending and Operating
Policies and Procedures gives 15% p.a. as the minimum nominal interest rate
for subloans to farmers (i.e. FFAP's ongoing rate), while rates for agro-
industrial subloans would be in accordance with FFI and FIP rates in force at
November 30, 1976 (see Annex C, Table 1).
3.05      Board presentation took place on December 28, 1976.  While general-
ly supporting the project, several Directors expressed concern about
onlending rates, the rate of inflation, and in particular the strong
possibility of substitution and/or diversion of funds in view of the substan-
tially higher returns offered by financial investments in Colombia. I/ The
Board believed that interest rates should become positive in real terms as
quickly as possible and noted the provision for review of these rates.
C. Objectives and Description
3.06      The project was to support a three-year lending program of BOR to
help finance on-farm investments by commercial farmers and investments in
agro-industries. Specifically, this lending program was to contribute to:
(a) expanding food production, to enable Colombia to continue meeting
nearly all her domestic food requirements from local resources;
(b) increasing the availabil±ty of inputs for industry from the
agricultural sector;
(c) maintaining agriculture's substantial contribution to export
earnings; and
(d) increasing employment opportunities, particularly in rural areas,
by creating jobs on farms and in agro-industries.
3.07      BOR was to establish a Project Account through which participating
agencies would rediscount subloans. Participating agencies would carry out
technical and financial evaluation of proposed investment plans as the basis
for subloan approval and would be responsible for ensuring that subborrowers
received adequate technical assistance. The foreign exchange risk was
assumed by BOR. 1/

Do Project Cost and Financing
3.08      Total project cost was estimated at US$174.1 million.  The Bank
loan of US$64.0 million was to finance 37X of the total project cost, which
represented the estimated foreign exchange cost. BOR and the participating
financial intermediaries were to contribute US$73.8 million equivalent (42%
of the total) and subborrowers, US$36.3 million equivalent (21X).
IV.  PROJECT IMPLENENTATION
A. Key Events
4.01      Loan signing took place on February 4, 1977, with effectiveness
expected by June 6, 1977. The only project-specific condition of effective-
ness was the signing of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Borrower and
one of the main participating banks, the Caja Agraria. Delay in finalizing a
legally acceptable agreement caused two postponements in the expected date of
effectiveness--to July 6, 1977 and then to September 6, 1977, when the Loan
and Guarantee Agreements were finally declared effective, seven months after
loan signing.
4.02      During project implementation, there were two reallocations of
funds among categories and two one-year extensions of the original Closing
Date (December 31, 1981) to allow full disbursement. The reallocations
occurred because of faster disbursements under Categories 2 (subloans to
medium- and large-scale farmers) and 3 (agro-industry subloans) than under
Category 1 (subloans to small farmers). In 1980, the Bank agreed to reallo-
cate the US$8.0 million of unallocated funds to Category 2 (US$2.0 million)
and Category 3 (US$6.0 million), and in 1981 to reallocate US$3.7 million
f-om Category 1 to Category 3.  Towards the end of 1982, however, after
lending to small farmers had accelerated, BOR was reimbursed from available
funds for eligible expenditures from either Category 3 or Category I without
a further change to Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement (see Annex A). the
actual Closing Date was December 31, 1983.
B. Implementation Problems
Interest Rates
4.03      One of the Bank's major concerns--keeping interest rates positive
(see para. 3.02)--continued to cause problems during project implementation.
At the time of Board presentation, Bank staff predicted that with existing
interest levels, effective rates would be zero in real terms during the
commitment period (1977-79), and positive thereafter. However, inflationary
pressure was building as the project became effective (due to the sharp
increase in the coffee price and a serious drought in much of Colombia in
late 1976 and early 1977), and inflation reached 39% in 1971. I/ To
encourage increased production and investment, the Government iowered some of
FFAP's nominal interest rates to 12-13% in May 1977; these rates were below
the 15% stipulated in the Loan Agreement and would have excluded up to 40% of
1/ See also comments from the BOR's Assistant Credit Manager in Annex D.



- 5 -
lending anticipated under Loan 1357-CO (in p.rticular, livestock development
lending, which was to account for 341 of loan funds). Soon thereafter, dis-
bursements were suspended for categories that no longer seemed eligible under
Loan 1357-CO, pending clarification of the application of these rates; in
fact, the new regulations effectively established two windows, one for
lending under Loan 1357-CO and one lending only FFAP funds. This distinction
disappeared within a year, when the nominal interest rates of all FFAP sub-
loans were increased to 181, except livestock lending rates, which were
increased to 15-17%: all FFAP interest rates thus became eligible under
Loan 1357-CO.
4.04      The interest rate under the agriculture and livestock component
again became an issue in 1980, when a credit line established for the Fondo
Rotatorio Banco Ganadero-INCORA (FBGI), which supported the livestock activi-
ties of beneficiaries of agrarian reform, was the sole channel of lending to
small farmers (para. 4.10). At that time, the terms of amortization for FBGI
subloans were changed in a way unacceptable to the Bank under Loan 1357-CO.
The nominal interest rate remained at 15%, but interest was not paid on the
loan or capitalized during a grace period of up to four years, giving an
effective interest rate of only about 11.5x. This resulted in a halt in
commitments of Category 1 funds until September 1981, when the nominal
interest rate for FBGI lending was raised to 18%.
4.05      In February 1977, the Government had also introduced some modifica-
tions (Resolution No. 35 of the Junta Monetaria) in lending terms for agro-
industries. As a result, an estimated two-thirds of the agro-industrial com-
ponent, intended to provide long-term financing for new facilities, would now
be ineligible for financing under the loan. I/ Specifically, the new
lending rates would have excluded short-term agro-industrial subloans in the
three large cities and longer term subloans in the rest of the country (see
Annex C, Table 1, p.1). The Bank made suggestions for amending Resolu-
tion 35, and pending resolution of this issue, it was agreed that no
disbursement applications for agro-industry subloans would be submitted to
the Bank. In February 1978, the Junta Monetaria introduced lending terms and
rates for agro-industries in conformity with those in Schedule 5 of the Loan
Agreement. Within three months, however, it introduced n^-' rates for FFI/FIP
lending outside the project, some of which were 1-2 points below rates
applicable under Loan 1357-CO (see Annex C, Table 1, p.2).
Diversion/Substitution of Funds
4.06      Because of the level of inflation, the differential between
interest paid on savings instruments (which were increasing rapidly) and
interest rates for FFAP subloans had become substantial, thereby encouraging
fund substitution. The Bank requested a survey on the level of substitution
and diversion over the two preceding lending years, which preliminary statis-
tics had indicated occurred most frequently under loans to the livestock sub-
sector. This trend was confirmed by a review carried out by BOR in
Nov4mber-December 1977. In October 1978, the Bank also scheduled a special
supervision mission to make a comprehensive study of this problem. The
consultant, who analyzed loans FFAP had to recall or cancel because of non-
compliance with investment plans, found that diversion of credit was a
serious problem: from 1975 to mid-1977, farmers had to repay, either totally
1/ See also comments from the BOR's Assistant Credit Manager in Annex D.



- 6 -
or partially, 319 FFAP loans out of 860 credit operations surveyed, giving a
noncompliance rate of 37%. Most of these were livestock loans.
4.07      As the commercial banks were lending FFAP funds increasingly to
large-scale farmers (with practically none going to small farmers), substitu-
tion seemed very likely. The Bank's consultant recommended use of
non-subsidized interest rates to eliminate the incentive for substitution,
but, as discussed above, this was not acceptable to the Government. The
Government and BOR did share the Bank's concern about diversion and substitu-
tion of funds, however, and strengthened the supervision effort for subse-
quent subloans.
Lending to Small Farmers
4.08      Commitments for lending to small farmers were initially much slower
than commitments under other categories. By the end of 1978, all of
Category 2 funds (US$23 million) for medium- and large-scale farmers had been
committed, compared to only 1.8% of Category 1 funds (US$0.25 million) for
small farmers. This was largely because FFAP policies and procedures were
not geared to lending to small farmers.
4.09      The prob'.em of channeling funds to small farmers was complex.  The
key difficulties appeared to be:
(a) technical assistance requirements. Under ongoing FFAP regulations,
all subborrowers had to sign a technical assistance contract with
university-level technicians; up to 2% of the proceeds of the
subloan could be utilized to pay for such services. Because of the
relatively small amount of each subloan, these professionals had no
interest in assisting small farmers. The Instituto Colombiano
Agropecuario (ICA), which was responsible for providing assistance
to small farmers, had limited resources and staff, and was mainly
concerned with other tasks. Middle-level professionals, working
satisfactorily with credit entities such as Caja Agraria, did not
qualify under FFAP regulations;
(b) availability of counterpart funds in FFAP. Financial intermedi-
aries tended to give priority to the needs of their larger,
better-known clients, or those who offered the best guarantees; and
(c) Caja Agraria's collateral requirements. Caja Agraria's regulation
that loans over six years had to be backed by a guarantee actually
prevented small farmers without land title, and particularly the
beneficiaries of INCORA's agrarian reform program, from gaining
access through Caja Agraria to the rediscounting facility of FFAP.
4.10      The possibility of channelling funds to small farmers through
another intermediary already lending to this segment of the farming popula-
tion was explored. As a result, in the second half of 1979, FFAP modified
its credit procedures to establish a separate line of credit for the FBGI.
It was agreed that FBGI loans could be discounted up to 95% by FFAP under the
small farmer category, the remaining 5% being provided by Banco Ganadero
(BG). This change resulted in commitments to small farmers in 1979 and 1980



- 7 -
being about 20 times higher than in the previous two years. However, at the
end of 1980, further commitments to small farmers were halted due to
difficulties with FBGI's interest rate (see para. 4.04).
4.11      The decision to allow lending to small farmers through the FBGI
scheme implied a relaxation of FFAP's technical assistance requirements. The
terms allowed under the FBGI scheme were later extended to Caja Agraria.
These changes--together with resolution of the interest rate issue at the end
of 1981 and FFAP's acceptance of "pledges on security' as subloan
guarantees, 1/ pending granting of land titles--stimulated a rapid take-off
of lending to small farmers in 1982, and by the end of that year, Category 1
funds were fully committed. Actual disbursements exceeded funds available in
Category 1 (see Annex A) and reached 98% of the appraisal estimate.
C. Agriculture and Livestock Component
4.12      The following table summarizes appraisal estimates and actual
lending under the agriculture and livestock component:

4.13      The project achieved the appraisal targets in terms of number of
beneficiaries, investments and distribution among subsectors. However, the
distribution of loans between small farmers and medium- and large-scale
farmers registered substantial changes. Moreover, subloans granted to small
farmers for agriculture were equivalent to only 10% of the appraisal estimate
(5% of estimated investments), while lending for livestock activities reached
150% of the appraisal estimate (290% of estimated investments).
4.14      Lending to large- and medium-scale farmers for livestock reached
only 42% of estimated beneficiaries (44% of estimated investments), while
lending for agriculture soared to 373% of appraisal estimates (161% of
estimated investments). This is mainly because: (a) the Bank was reluctant
to finance livestock operations for medium- and large-scale farmers because
of the great risk of fund substitution (see para. 4.07); (b) the change in
some FFAP lending terms initially halted disbursements for livestock subloans
(para. 4.03); and (c) most of the lending to medium- and large-scale farmers
was channeled through ^ommercial banks, which prefer to lend short-term
credit.
4.15      An important feature of the agriculture and livestock component is
the role of the three public sector banks, Caja Agraria, Banco Ganadero and
Banco Cafetero, which processed 84% of subloans and 75% of total lending, as
shown in Table 2.

D. Agro-industrial Component
4.16      The following table compares appraisal estimates of the number and
value of investments with the actual outcome:

a!  Amounts were converted using the exchange rate at the time of Bank
disbursement (see footnote to Table 1).
4.17      The total number of investments and average value of investments
were about three times the appraisal estimates because the subprojects
financed were larger than estimated, and many included such items as working
capital (which could not be financed under Loan 1357-CO) and additional
financing from other sources. Bank funds were used in large financial
packages where its share averaged 18.5% of total investments, compared to the
45% estimated at appraisal. Total lending (i.e. minus the beneficiaries'
contribution of US$52.6 million) was US$83.4 million, giving an average of
about US$450,000 per subloan, which is within the limit of US$500,000 speci-
fied in the Loan Agreement. Details of the subsectors financed and the
performance of sample borrowers are given in Annex C, Tables 2 and 3.
4.18      The agro-industrial component was implemented over five years
(1978-82) rather than the three years expected at appraisal. Initial delays
were caused by changes to the interest rates provided for in the Loan Agree-
ment (para. 4.05). There were also protracted discussions about the limit on
BOR's subloan participation. Subloan financing had been estimated as
follows: intermediaries 17%, IBRD 60% and BOR 23%. However, BOR understood
that funds from Loan 1357-CO could be utilized to finance some larger invest-
ment projects jointly with other sources, including FFI and FIP funds. Since
some FFI and FIP interest rates for lending outside the project were lower
than those under Loan 1357-CO (para. 4.05), the Bank raised the ceiling on
BOR participation to 25%, and in January 1979, the Loan Agreement was amended
to allow the 25% limit to apply to the sum of subloans submitted for Bank
disbursement, and not to each particular investment or subloan. Subsequently
however, both FFI and FIP lending terms were increased in 1981 to an average
of 27% p.a., while Loan 1357-CO terms were increased to 24% p.a., so that the
weighted average cost of subloans under the project was higher than required
under the Loan Agreement.

E. Changes in Project Cost and Financing
4.19      The total project cost, estimated at US$174.1 million, increased by
57% to US$272.8 million. The cost of the agriculture and livestock
component (US$136.8 million) was close to the appraisal estimate of US$130.7
million. However, the cost of the agro-industrial component (US$136.0
million) was over three times greater than the appraisal estimate of US$43.8
million because of changes in the average size of investments (para. 4.17).
Table 4 compares actual financial contributions under the agro-industrial
component with the appraisal estimates.

F. Noncompliance with Covenants
4.20      The Borrower complied with all covenants of the Loan Agreement,
except the following:
(a) Monitoring and evaluation system. The Borrower was to set up a
system for monitoring at least 5% of project investments, and for
collecting technical and financial dita to allow an evaluation of
the effects of the project within six months of Loan Agreement
signing (Loan Agreement, Section 3.03). The Borrower failed to
comply within the time specified, but partial compliance was
achieved in March 1981 when such a system was established for the
agro-industrial component.
(b) Separate accounts for project entities. The Borrower was to cause
each project financial intermediary to establish and maintain
separate accounts for the project. These accounts were to be
audited and submitted via the Borrower to the Bank within four
months of the end of the fiscal year (Loan Agreement, Section
4.04). BOR did not insist on compliance with this covenant because
of the additional accounting and auditing burden it implied.
However, the portfolio balances of project financial intermediaries
were submitted to the Bank from time to time.

4.21      One covenant of the Loan Agreement (Section 3.04(a)), which allowed
the Borrower, the Guarantor or the Bank to call for a review of interest
rates, was never invoked. 1/ The Bank did not call for such a review, even
though interest rates were negative in real terms during part of tle
implementation period (see para. 7.03).
V. PROJECT IMPACT
A. Agriculture and Livestock Component
5.01      Lending for directly productive purposes (agriculture and
livestock) totaled about US$103 million, of which the Bank disbursed US$38.7
million. In current pesos, project lending in the six years of implementa-
tion totaled about Col$ 5,400 million, which was equivalent to 4.3% of total
lending by FFAP of Col$ 126,000 million during 1977-82. Bank disbursements
were equivalent to Col$ 2,050 million, or 1.6% of total lending by FFAP.
5.02      FFAP does not have an evaluation system, despite a legal covenant
to that effect (para. 4.20). No evaluation of the project's impact on
agricultural production was carried out for the completion report. However,
FFAP, with the assistance of BG and Caja Agraria, prepared an impact evalu-
ation report on smallholders who received subloans for livestock develop-
ment. Out of the 4,512 operations financed, 373 were selected (8.3%).
Income figures given in the report represent the gross value of production
valued on the basis of known production. The lack of data on production
costs prevents a rate of return calculation for the farms surveyed.
Performance of Sample Livestock Operations
5.03      Investments and Subloans.  Average investment in the 373 selected
farms was Col$ 643,200 (US$10,000), equal to the original appraisal estimate
(which had, however, been raised in 1981 to US$15,000 to allow for increases
in domestic prices) and somewhat larger than the Col$ 589,100 average for all
livestock lending. Subloans averaged Col$ 504,700 (US$7,900) and the
beneficiaries' contribution was thus about 22%, consistent with the FFAP
minimum of 20% then in force. Beneficiaries used about 20% of the subloans
for investments other than cattle (including the development of new pastures)
and 80% for animal purchases, both figures within FFAP parameters. Applied
to the total investment, the corresponding figures are 37% and 63%, respec-
tively, the latter being below the appraisal limit of 75% for cattle
purchases.
5.04      Type of Guarantee.  The following guarantees were given by the 361
borrowers for whom information was available:
Mortgage                    192       (53%)
Pledge on Security          124       (35%)
Institutional                26        (7%)
Co-signer                    19        (5%)
1/ See also comments from the BOR's Assistant Credit Manager in Annex D.



- 12 -
Although 93% of beneficiaries owned their land, only half could produce a
land title acceptable as a guarantee; in several instances, the value of the
land was not adequate to serve as collateral. Caja Agraria was legally
required to have any loan over six years (i.e. all livestock loans) secured
by a mortgage, which suggests the difficulty of lending to smallholders.
5.05      Recoveries.  The first repayments on subloans granted in 1981 were
due in 1984; so far, recoveries have been very good. Both BG and Caja
Agraria are satisfied with the quality of the borrowers and expect few bad
loans or e.elays in repayments. Outstanding payments not recovered in 1984
were 0.7% of Caja Agraria's total 1357-CO portfolio and 3.5% of Banco
Ganadero's (for comparison, the corresponding figure for FFAP at December 31,
1983, was 6.3% for all financial intermediarig's). 1,
5.06      Size of Holdings.  The report states that 52 beneficiaries (14% of
the sample) bought 1,307 ha to expand their holdings, giving an increase in
farm areas over the "before project" situation, as follows:
Before Project     With Project      Increase        z
............ ...... .. (a............. ..... .ha)
Average farm area            73.1               76.6             3.5        4.8
Pasture area                 52.5               57.8             5.3       10.1
The "with project" situation seems to be consistent with the appraisal
report's two typical cattle operations, one for a 40-ha dual-purpose farm and
the other for a 60-ha dairy farm.
5.07      Production.  Investments made under the project seem to have
resulted in improved farming practices and increased production. Of the
farms surveyed, three quarters practiced improved animal husbandry and
pasture rotatior.. The carrying capacity of pasture has increased, allowing
the herd size to grow by about 75%. Milk production has experienced a three-
fold increase and meat production, a fourfold increase (see Annex B). These
figures suggest a satisfactory return on the project investment in livestock
development.
5.08      Estimated Income.  Technical agents estimated the average income of
farmers surveyed at Col$ 711,800 (US$6,382) in 1984, i.e. about five times
the minimum salary in the rural sector. This tremendous improvement is
particularly significant for the 13% of beneficiaries who became livestock
farmers but were previously salaried workers. The estimated gross income for
year 3 is higher than the appraisal estimate.
5.09      Employment.  The number of farm workers permanently employed (i.e.
spending more than 250 days a year on the farm) increased from 1,147 when
subloans were approved, to 1,612 after the investment period-an increase of
465 jobs (40%). If these results are applied proportionally to the 4,512
smallholder livestock operations financed under the project, the creation of
new jobs would be about 5,000; however, part of this figure would account for

- 13 -
elimination of underemployment. Nonecheless, the smallholder livestock
operations may well have contributdd half of the appraisal employment target
of 8,000 new jobs.
B. Agro-Industrial Component
5.10      Overall, Bank funds represented 13% of FFI/FIP lending (Col$ 1,320
million out of Col$ 10,000 million) during the disbursement period. The
Appraisal Report did not set targets by type of enterprise, but the loan was
intended to benefit mainly small enterprises, i.e. those with total assets
not exceeding US$750,000. At least three quarters of subloans went to small-
and medium-size enterprises (despite the tendency of commercial institutions
to prefer lending to larger enterprises), as shown below:
Assets                   No. of Loans        X
Under US$750,000                         117           62.9
Between US$0.75-i.50 million              31           16.7

186          100.0
Performance of Sample Agro-industrial Borrowers
5.11      Thirty beneficiaries (16% of the total) were chosen as a sample to
evaluate the development of their investment plans financed under the
project. These included enterprises in 11 subsectors out of the 18 in which
loans were granted (see Annex C, Table 3). Only one borrower chose not to
utilize the loan granted to his enterprise; all the other borrowers carried
out the investments as planned, and in most cases implemented larger invest-
ments than originally proposed. Out of the 20 existing enterprises, eight
increased production over their base figures, four reached their projected
targets and six exceeded the projections; all 20 increased their sales, and
15 exceeded their projections on sales volume. Nine enterprises started new
activities with the investment under the project; most had not yet completed
their investments, but three had already achieved their projected volume of
sales.
5.12      Employment.  The 29 firms originally had 2,138 employees and
expected to reach 2,795 employees with the approved investments. Total
employment in 1983 reached 3,067, thus creating 929 new jobs instead of the
expected 'U57. If this result is applied proportionally to the remaining
investments, the increased employment for all 186 investments would reach
about 6,000 jobs, at an investment Gf about US$23,000 per job created. Taken
together with job creation under the agricultural component (para. 5.09), the
project appears to have exceeded its job creation target.

5.13      Economic Rates of Return.  Only 50 loan applicatious had ERR
calculations, with rates nf 22-139% and an average rate of 45%.  Information
from BOR for a small sample of subprojects comparing ex-ante ERR estimates
with actual figures reveals little change from previous estimates or, in some
cases, actual figures better than the estimates.
VI. ONSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.01      BOR, the Borrower, has implemented the project satisfactorily using
its three financial fitnds: FFAP, FFI, and FIP. Implementation took six
years--twice as long as estimated at appraisal--mainly because of difficul-
ties in agreeing with the Bank on the terms of lending and interest rates.
These are regulated by the Monetary Board, which made it difficult for BOR to
adhere to policies laid down in the Appraisal Report and the Loan Agreement,
and advocated by supervision missions. It took two years to agree on
interest rates and three years to devise a scheme that would give small
farmers access not only to Bank funds under Loan 1357-CO, but to FFAP funds
in general.
6.02      BOR was much more involved in supervising credit granted b
financial intermediaries than is usual from a rediscounting window.  /  It
has an efficient and thorough control unit, which selectively checks on
investments, together with the financial intermediary or alone, and flags any
discrepancies. This activity was strengthened at the start of project
implementation (para. 4.07) because of fears about diversion of funds.
Substitution may have occurred under the project, and could only have been
prevented by allowing interest rates to more closely reflect market rates.
6.03      BOR's main weakness lies in the failure of .he three funds (FFAP,
FIP and FFI) to evaluate the impact of operations financed. FFAP has yet to
establish a system to monitor the progress of investments financed with its
funds (para. 4.20). FFAP pointed out that as a rediscounting window, 1/ it
surrenders direct management of the project to the financial intermediaries
and the beneficiaries themselves. A more general difficulty in assessing the
impact of the project was its marginal contribution (4% of total FFAP lending
during implementation). Finally, FFAP has had no experience in ex-post
evaluation.

VII. BANK'S PERFORMANCE
7.01      Because small farmers had difficulty in obtaining FFAP funds, the
Bank's initiative in earmarking roughly 25% of the loan proceeds for
smallholders was timely and constructive. However, the Bank failed to
address several problems with this type of lending. First, the participating
financial agencies (other than public sector banks) were not, and are still
not geared to this kind of borrower. Second, FFAP was legally prevented from
rediscounting loans not supported by a technical assistance contract. The
only intermediary lending to smallholders was Caja Agraria, which did not
have access to FFAP rediscounting because its technical assistance was
provided by technicians (middle-level professionals) rather than the required
university-level supervisors. Finally, Caja Agraria had difficulty in making
long-term loans (over six years) to farmers without adequate guarantees, such
as land titles. These problems delayed implementation of the smallholder
component for three years. A scheme to allow lending to small livestock
farmers was devised in the face of these difficulties to permit disbursement
of this component. This scheme turned out to be one of the positive aspects
of the project; smallholders have gained access to FFAP rediscounting, and
this is now a permanent feature of PFAP lending.
7.02      The Bank's efforts to achieve a consistent interest rate policy,
with positive rates, were not successful.  BOR was unable to respond to the
Bank's suggestion of raising lending terms above those established by the
Monetary Board; in fact, BOR lent Bank funds at the rates agreed, but FFAP
and FJP/FFI funds at different (sometimes lower) rates. Thus FFAP retained a
multi-tier rate structure and its rates--which were positive in some years of
project implementation only because interest is collected quarterly in
advance--were on average two-thirds of the commercial rates.
7.03      These difficulties suggest that macroeconomic policy issues cannot
be resolved solely in the context of an individual project, but should also
be pursued in a broad context such as policy-based sector loans. Under this
particular project, the Bank had little leverage since its funds represented
only 1.6% of FFAP lending for agriculture and 13% of FFI and FIP agro-
industrial lending during the period of disbursement. The Bank never
requested a review of lending terms (Section 3.04 of the Loan Agreement). In
retrospect, inclusion of this covenant was not constructive, since by the
time of Board presentation, all indications were that no progress was being
made on the interest rate issue.
7.04      The number of Bank supervision missions was adequate (an average of
two per year). However, the missions were unable to address all outstanding
problems because a particular crisis always diverte'. attention from more
minor concerns. For example, few supervision missions raised the Borrower's
obligation to establish a monitoring and evaluation system, essentially
because there were other more immediate problems to resolve. Although one
mission was specificaily to review this topic and a detailed letter was sent
to the Borrower on how to establish such a system, future missions did not



- 16 -
strenuously follow up on the matter and the system was never established.
Another example was the submission of Progress Reports, which were
received--if somewhat irregularly--during the early years, but then stopped
coming. A greater effort by supervision missions to secure comprehensive
Progress Reports on time might have constituted the first step in building a
monitoring system within FFAP.
7.05      The Bank's impact on institution building was insignificant.  FFAP
is a reasonably well organized institution. One of its few weaknesses is the
absence of a monitoring and evaluation system. However, efforts in this
regard produced no results. In implementing the agro-industrial component
through FFI and FIP, the Bank's impact was greater, due to continuous
assistance under ongoing DFC projects.
VIII. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
8.01      The Second Agricultural Credit Project was the Bank's first direct
involvement with FFAP, the BOR's specialized financial fund for agriculture.
FFAP plays a useful role in agricultural development, a role that will be
enhanced by the introduction of an agricultural marketing line of credit.
FFAP should be supported by the Bank, provided that its onlending terms and
procedures, as decreed by the Monetary Board, are compatible with the Bank's
objectives. The Monetary Board guidelines for agricultural lending generally
take the agricultural development policies of the Ministry of Agriculture
into account. The Bank needs a comprehensive knowledge of the functioning of
both the agricultural and financial sectors to assess the appropriateness of
established interest rates for meeting their policy objectives. Based on
this kind of evaluation, the Bank might be able to make progress towards a
more desirable interest rate policy (including removal of the present
interest rate subsidy) through a dialogue with all the parties involved in
regulating interest rates.
8.02      Appraisal reports should include a full treatment of the interest
rate issue, which will affect project design. Furthermore, monitoring and
evaluation systems are important for both project implementation and
institution building, and they should be treated in more detail in appraisal
reports. Details of the systems should be developed and agreed upon during
preparation, and compliance with the covenant to establish such systems
should be actively pursued during supervision.

Technical Data from Smallholder Livestock Survey
Technical Assistance
1.        A total of 2,313 visits were made to the 373 borrowers during the
three years under review, with an average of about 5.6 months between
visits. FFAP found this acceptable, particularly in view of the cost
involved (estimated at US$40 per visit). Findings indicate adoption of
better farming and livestock technology: 97% of farmers carry out vaccina-
tion and vermifuge treatment, and 82% administer salt; in 87% of the farms,
pasture use is rotated and in 64%, weed control is carried out. Almost half
of the farmers have attended courses, field days or other forms of training.
Smallholders in Colombia, in general, do not keep books, and the fact that
one-third of the farms reviewed has some sort of accounts is credited to the
efforts of the technical assistance.
Technical Coefficients
2.        The carrying capacity of pasture increased from 0.36 AU/ha to 0.64
AU/ha during the investment period and now stands at 0.82 AU/ha. Total herd
size has increased from 8,650 head to i5,282 during the investment period,
and stands now at 21,998 head, roughly a threefold increase. The average
animal population per farm has progressed, respectively, from 23 to 41 and
59.
Milk and Meat Production
3.        Milk production by the farms under review increased from a low base
of 71 liter/ha to 225 liter/ha in three years, averaging an annual increase
of 70%, well above the national average growth rate of about 7% per year.
The average daily productivity of milk per cow milked reached 2.8 kg, in line
with appraisal estimates for year 3 of development. Meat production
increased fourfold, from 10.1 kg/ha/year to 46.3 kg/ha/year. The average
calving rate of the herd was 58%, compared to the present national average of
49%. The growth in the reproduction rate to 2.9% is considered very good in
relation to the national average of 2.2%.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT (Loan 1357-CO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Comments from the Borrower
Translation of incoming telex
14050 Bogota, April 30, 1987
INTBAFRAD
Graham Donaldson
Chief, Agriculture and Human Resources Division
Operations Evaluation Department
Washington, D.C.
Ref.: Completion Report, Loan IBRD 1357-CO
We give below the Banco de la RepuLblica's comments on the Spanish
version of the above report:
2.02 (p. 2): As the paragraph is written, it makes it appear that
FFAP is administered by DCF; it should therefore be specified that DCF comes
under the Departamento de Credito Agropecuario.  In addition, the term margen
de redescuento used to render the English "rediscounting spread" has a
different connotation from what is intended and should therefore be replaced
by margen de intermediaci6n.
3.05 (p. 4): The word represtamos should be replaced by
subprestamos.
3.07 (p. 4): The last sentence of the paragraph should be reworded
as follows:  El riesgo cambiario seria asumido por la cuenta especial de
cambios administrada por el Banco de la Repuiblica ("The exchange risk would
be assumed by the special exchange account administered by BOR").
4.03 (p. 5): Inflation at no time reached 39% in 1977; the figure
was 28.4X.
4.05 (p. 6): Resolution 35 of 1977 never established rate
differentiation by term, but only by asset levels and location of beneficiary
enterprises.

ANNEX D
Page 2 of 2
4.11 (p. 8): It is asserted that one of the reasons that caused
lending to small farmers to gather momentum, apart from the relaxing of the
technical assistance requirements and the resolving of the interest rate
issue, was "FFAP's acceptance of "pledges on security" as subloan guarantees
pending granting of land litles," concerning which it would be explained that
FFAP as a rediscount fund or second-tier facility does not require or lay down
any rules as to guarantees. Guarantees are exclusively a matter for the
financial intermediaries in their relations with the subborrowers. What
happened in this case was that by reducing the term of subloans to small
farmers, FFAP made it easier for Caja Agraria to accept pledges instead of
mortgage guarantees, in accordance with its internal regulations.
4.21 (P. 13): It is stated that the covenant allowing for review of
interest rates was never invoked. This statement requires clarification,
since one of the main points of difference arose from a disagreement between
IBRD and BOR on this matter. There was not in fact any need at that time to
resort to this covenant.
5.05 (p. 14): It should be explained that the figure of 6.3% for
outstanding payments or overdue portfolio of FFAP as of December 31, 1983
refers to the portfolio of the financial intermediaries using FFAP funds and
not FFAP's portfolio, since FFAP, as a second-tier facility, does not have an
overdue portfolio.
5.11 (p.16): The "thirteen beneficiaries" in the first sentence of
the Spanish should read "thirty beneficiaries."
6.02 and 6.03 (p. 17):  The term manipulaci6n de redescuento used
in the Spanish to render "rediscounting window" should be replaced by
operacion de redescuento.

Beatriz Marulanda de Garcia
