JORDAN
INDUSTRY AND TRADE POLICY ADJUSTMENT LOAN
LOAN SUMMARY
Borrower:                           The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
Amount:                             US$150 million
Terms:                              17 years, including a five-year grace
period, at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate.
Objectives and Description:         The proposed loan would suppurt the
Government's ongoing structural adjustment
program designed to lay the basis for
sustainable long-term growth, which is
supported by an IMF Stand-By Arrangement
and compensatory financing (of about
US$100 million over an 18-month period).
The proposed loan would include measures
to ensure a competitive and stable
macroeconomic environment; to improve the
competitiveness and efficiency of industry
and trade; to rationalize public
expenditure; and initiate a program to
protect the poor during the adjustment
period. It aims to strengthen the most
important sources of growth in the
Jordanian economy, i.e., the expansion and
diversification of industrial output and
exports. The proposed loan would support
policy reforms to create a more uniform,
non-distortionary set of incentives across
different sectors in the economy by (i)
rationalizing the trade regime and
replacing the current system of investment
incentives by one that is simpler and more
transparent; and (ii) strengthening the
institutions that support industry and
exports.
Benefits and Risks:                 The reforms supported by the proposed loan
are expected to reduce macroeconomic
imbalances and create a more favorable
environment for overall economic and
sectoral growth at a time of resource
constraints. In particular, reforms in
the trade regime and reforms of
institutions supporting export promotion,



-ii-
industrial infrastructure and standards
are expected to make the manufacturing
sector a more efficient producer of export
products and import substitutes. Risks
relate to the length and difficulty of the
adjustment process, possible social and
political pressuies, unpredictable
developments in the external environment,
and uncertainties in the response of the
private sector. These risks are mitigated
by the Government's strong commitment to
the objectives of the adjustment program,
as shown by the significant reforms
already taken. Fiaally, the proposed loan
includes measures to support the
Government's strategy for protecting the
poor during the adjustment period.
Estimated Disbursements:            Of the proposed loan of US$150 million,
US$148.5 million would be disbursed
against general imports (subject to a
negative list), US$0.5 million for the
technical assistance program for industry
and trade, and US$1.0 million towrards a
program to assist the poor by reorienting
and improving the efficiency of social
services delivery organizations. The
disbursement schedule is provided at Annex
X. The proceeds of the proposed loan to
be disbursed against general imports would
be disbursed in two tranches: US$75
million following loan effectiveness and
the balance of US$73.5 million subject to
the satisfactory implementation of agreed
policy measures. The remaining US$1.5
million would be disbursed against the
technical assistance programs in industry
and trade, and for assisting the poor.
Release of the second tranche is expected
eight months after effectiveness.
Cofinancing of up to US$150 million
equivalent is being sought from Japan and
US$17 million equivalent from the Federal
Republic of Germany.
Staff Appraisal Report:              This is a combined President's and Staff
Appraisal Report.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
INDUSTRY AND TRADE POLICY ADJUSTMENT LOAN TO
THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
for the equivalent of US$150 million to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to
support an industry and trade policy adjustment program. The proposed loan
would have a term of 17 years, including a grace period of five years, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate. Cofinancing of up to US$150 million
equivalent may be obtained from the Goverimnent of Japan and up to US$17
million equivalent from the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany.
PART 1. TH- ECONOMY
2.        "Jordan: Policies and Prospects for Small- and Medium-Scale
Manufacturing Industries" (Report No. 6848-Jo) was circulated to the
Executive Directors in January 1988. A mission to review major economic
trends visited Jordan in November 1988. The findings of this mission, as
well as those obtained at the time of appraisal of the proposed loan in May
1989, the subsequent mission in August 1989, and the IMF Article IV
consultation/use of Fund resources mission in March 1989, are reflected in
this section of the report and -in the country data in Annex I.
A. Economic DeveloDments 1982-88
3.        Economic trends in Jordan are an outcome of the country's proximity
to an oil-rich region and its unique structural features. Jordan has a very
large services sector, accounting for nearly 60% of GDP. By contrast, it has
an extremely narrow productive base. Apart from its educated and
hard-working people, its only natural resources are phosphate, potash and
limestone. Less than 5% of its agricultural land is arable, virtually all of
its oil has to be imported, and water is an increasingly scarce resource,
with competing demands fro:a irrigation, urbanization and industrialization.
4.        Conscious of the country's unique geographical situation and narrow
productive base, the Government pursued liberal, outward-looking policies in
Lrade, labor migration and foreign exchange transfers during the 1970s.
Incentive policies were increasingly geared to promoting private enterprise.
These policies enabled Jordan to respond to emerging opportunities .A
neighboring countries during the late seventies. Stimulated by large
remittances from Jordanians working abroad, the introduction of improved
agricultural technology, Lne rise of mining exports, the rising demand for
Jordanian manufactured products in neighboring countries, and increased grant
aid, the economy operated at full employment and grew by about 10% p.a. from
1978 to 1982. Jordan's productive base expanded and became increasingiy
diversified, and the standard of living improved. While both the current



-2-
account balance of payments and the budget showed substantial deficits, these
were largely covered by foreign grants. Foreign burrowing was not excessive
and inflation remained low.
5.        The rapid decline in the price of oil and the subsequent slowdown
in regional economies, which began in 1982, adversely affected the Jordanian
ecotlomy in three ways. First, there was a reduction in the demand for
Jordanian goods and services in neighboring countries, resulting in a decline
in the export of agricultural and manufactured goods which are sold almost
exclusively in regional markets. Second, there was a slowdown in the
out-migration of Jordanians; this caused a stagnation in remittances and
created unemployment within Jordan. Third, between 1982 and 1988, there was
a 30% reduction i1n grant aid.  Grant aid has traditionally financed about 30%
of Jordan's imports and amounted to about 80% of domeatic tax and non-tax
revenue. This decline put a severe strain on the Government's budgetary
operations, as well as on its balance of payments (Table 1).
6.        The regional recession not only affected the external demand for
Jordanian goods but domestic demand as well. Consequently, there has been a
drastic slowdown in growth, which has become more pronounced since 1984:
during 1984-88, real output growth slowed to about 2.5% p.a., and total
investment fell by about 5% p.a. Given the continuing high population growth
of about 3.8% p.a., Jordan experienced a sharp fall in per capita income and
a decline in its standard of living.
7.        Unemployment was another product of the recession.  In 1986, the
last year for which data are available, nearly 40% of the Jordanian work
force was employed in the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states.
Out-migration to the GCC, which had growr, by 2%-3% p.a. during 1975-82, has
since fallen to zero. Thus, after experiencing almost full employment during
1975-82, nearly 10% of Jordanian workers were unemployed oy 1986. The
unemployment situation is certain to have worsened since then, given
demographic trends, the increasing participation of women in the labor force,
and the continued presence of low-wage guest workers who constitute about 20%
of Jordan's labor force.
8.        Jordan's fiscal performance has also deteriorated since 1983, after
steadily improving during the previous five years. The overall budget
deficit (including grants) was brought down from over 17% of CDP in 1978 to
under 5% of GDP in 1983. It has increased steadily since then and in 1988
stood at 14.7% of GDP. This worsening trend reflects: (i) the increase in
public investments from 13% to 20% of GDP over 1983 to 1988; (ii) an increase
in current expenditures from 33% to 37% of GDP; and (iii) a decline in
budgetary grants from 14% to 8% of GDP. These three negative trends have
more than offset the steady increase in revenue from 28% of GDP in 1983 to
about 32% of GDP in 1988.
9.        Historically, Jordan's balance of payments (BOP) has shown a large
current account deficit (CAD), the result of a very high dependence on
imports and an extremely narrow base for exports. In 1984-88, the CAD
averaged about 20% of GDP. However, about 75% of this deficit had been
financed by grants, thus limiting commercial financing to only about 5% of
GDP.

-4-
10.       During the early 1980s, Jcrdan's BOP deteriorated as a result of
the increase in the price of oil and the decline in grants. The CAD
(including grants) increased from 2.5% of GDP during 1978-82 to 8.7% of GDP
during 1982-84, resulting in a substantial increase in foreign borrowing and
an accumulation of foreign debt. Since 1984, however, real imports have
grown by less than half the rate of real exports. In addition, import prices
have fallen by as much as 6% p.a., or, on average, two percentage points
faster than export prices. As a result of these developments, the CAD
(including grants) has fallen from 8.7% of GDP in 1982-84 to 5.2% of GDP in
1384-88. Despite this decline in CAD the overall balance of payments came
under severe strain after 1984, due to the buildup of military debt (see
para. 14 below).
11.       In 1988, notwithstanding some improvement in the CAD, the overall
BOP continued to deteriorate. There was a sharp increase in the debt service
payments due on civil and military debt. The trade credits owed to Jordan by
some of its neighbors (nearly US$450 million by the end of 1988) remained
unpaid. There was also political uncertainty regarding the status of the
Palestinians following King Hussein's announcement delinking Jordan from the
West Bank; this resulted in capital flight not captured in official
statistics. All of the above created speculative pressures on the JD and
reduced the reserves at the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) to less than two
weeks of imports towards the end of 1988.
12.       External Indebtedness:  Comprehensive statistics on Jordan's stock
of external debt are only available for end-1988, which forms the basis for
estimates of future debt service. For the past, data on civilian debt can be
obtained from the Bank's Debtor Reporting System (DRS). The data on the
remaining (largely military) debt are obtained from the Government.
13.       On the whole, the increase in Jordan's indebtedness can be traced
to the increase in the CAD after grants during 1982-84 and the rapid build up
of military debt after 1984. Jordan's civilian medium- and long-term (MLT)
debt outstanding and disbursed (DOD), about which there is detailed
information in the Debtor Reporting System (DRS), rose from 32% of GNP in
1980 to almost 70% of GNP by 1988. However, nearly 50% of this debt is
concessional. As a result, civilian debt service obligations, as a
proportion of exports of goods and services, remained low, despite rising
sharply from only 5.3% in 1980 to 18.9% in 1988. Since 1984, the rate at
which new civilian debt has been contracted has slowed down drastically as a
result of the reduction in the CAD after grants. Commitments have fallen
from a high of US$593 million in 1984 to about US$188 million in 1988.
14.       In addition to the civilian debt, Jordan has also contracted
substantial military debt mainly during the period after 1984, almost
doubling its civilian debt service ratios during 1980-87. In 1988, the
payments on known military and civilian debt rose sharply. In addition, the
estimates of total debt (outstanding and disbursed) were revised upwards by
US$2.7 billion. As a result, in 1988, Jordan's debt/GNP ratio increased to
about 144%, and the debt service ratio increased to 39%. By 1988 Jordan was
a highly indebted country which was not in a position to fully service its
debt. For the future, Jordan's solvency and creditworthiness depend upon the
strength and credibility of its adjustment program, the external environment,
and its success in obtaining concessional financing. These are discussed in
detail in Part II.D.

B.  Government's Policy Response and Its Impact
15.       Although fragmented, the response of the Jordanian Government
during the early 1980s to the economic slowdown was designed to protect the
existing productive enterprises. The response was perhaps based on the
optimistic assumption that the difficulties being experienced by the oil
surplus countries, and their consequences to the Jordanian economy, were
temporary. In the agricultural sector, a system of production licensing and
subsidies was introduced in 1985 to reduce the output of crops which faced
marketing difficulties abroad.  In addition, production was supported by
highly subsidized inputs, and self-sufficiency in cereals was encouraged by
offering high purchasing prices to farmers. In the industrial sector, in the
early 1980s, high import tariffs and bans on competitive imports were
introduced to protect domestic producers from falling demand. Although these
bans protected a large number of producers, their macroeconomic impact was
small. The banned imports amounted to only 3% of the total value of imports
before the ban was imposed, and, by and large, Jordan's trade and payments
system remained relatively open and free of non-tariff barriers. Finally,
tax concessions and other incentives were- offered to private investors, and
bilateral trade agreements were increasingly seen as an instrument for
expanding trade with neighboring countries.
16.       The first adverse consequence of the policy stance maintained by
the Government in the early 1980s was a steady erosion in the internation-I
competitiveness of goods and services produced within Jordan.  In the face  of
falling grants and remittances,-Jordan's nominal exchange rate was maintained
through expanded external borrowing and a drawdown of resources. Since 1984,
most of the export growth can be accounted for by phosphate and potash.
Exports of agricultural and manufactured products have fallen and remain
overwhelmingly concentrated in the Middle Eastern markets. At the same time,
falling wage rates in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, combined with the strong
Jordanian dinar, have considerably narrowed the wage differential between
Jordan and the regional labor market. This has eroded the incentive to
migrate, resulting in stagnating remittances. Finally, the high real wage in
Jordan has stifled the growth of commercial services, such as computer
software development, engineering consultancy, advertising and maintenance
contracting. All of these could be important sources of growth given
Jordan's skilled labor force and well-developed infrastructure.
17.       The second consequence of the Government's policy stance during the
early 1980s was growing macroeconomic imbalances which accentuated the
structural problems with the budget and balance of payments. During the
early 1980s, Jordan followed a budgetary policy of increasing the tax effort,
cutting back on capital expenditures, and financing the deficit by borrowing
from abroad. However, Jordan's tax base was narrow, i.e., excessively
dependent upon import duties without a broad-based consumption tax. Jordan's
expenditures, on the other hand, were ir.creasingly dominated by
non-discretionary expenditures, such as debt service payments, pension and
social security payments. Finally, the Government was overly dependent upon
grants and borrowing from abroad to finance the deficit which quickly became
constrained by the increased debt burden.
18.       By late 1987, the Government realized -that the regional recession
was not a temporary, cyclical phenomenon and that stronger and more permanent
measures were needed. The Government initiated some reforms in early 1988
and accelerated the process towards the end of 1988 and earlv 1989 in



-6-
response to the emerging balance of payments difficulties. The reform
process culminated in the adoption of a coiiiprehensive medium-term adjustment
program supported by an IMF Stand-By arrangement (approved by the IMF on July
12, 1989). The increase in prices associated with the Government's program
touched off social disturbances in April 1989 and led to the fall of the
Government in May 1989. The new Government has, nevertheless, indicated its
firm commitment to the reform program and has maintained the pace of the
reform set by the previous Government. The main elements of the reform
program implemented so far include: a series of measures to reduce the budget
deficit such as a hike in taxes and petroleum prices and more restraint in
public expenditure; a freeze on new external borrowing; a large devaluation
of the dinar; the deregulation of the financial sector, involving a freeing
up of interest rates and an increase in the ceiling on funds held abroad by
cimmercial banks; and a package of measures to stimulate industry and trade.
Most of these actions were recommended in the Bank's economic and sector work
and formed the core of the policy dialogue w,'ith the Government.  The measures
that have alr2ady been implemented are listed below and summarized in the
policy matrix attached as Auinex IV.
(i)  Exchange Rate:
19.       In October 1988, the CBJ withdrew its commitment to buy and sell
Jordanian dinars (JD) at the official exchange rate, thereby, effectively
floating the JD.  This led to an immediate deoreciation of the dinar from
0.33 JD per US dollar to about 0.50 JD per US dollar. This depreciation was
accompanied by the emergence of different, and highly fluctuating, exchange
rates for transactions carried out by the CBJ, commercial banks, and money
changers. To deal with the resulting volatility and speculation in the
foreign exchange market, the CBJ and the commercial bank rates were unified
at 0.54 JD/US$ on February 8, 1989.  All transactions were to be carried out
at this new rate, and the CBJ was to intervenc in the market to maintain
stability and to ensure balance between the demand and supply of foreign
exchange. At the same time, the money changers were closed down because the
Government believed that they were indulging in speculative and illegal
activities.
20.       The economy's underlying financial difficulties, however, continued
to create an excess demand for foreign exchange and exert a downward pressure
on the Jordanian dinar. Beginning in April/May 1989, the commercial banks
began to charge commissions on top of the official exchange rate set by the
CBJ, depreciating the JD by as much as 15% to 20% in commercial transactions
vis-a-vis the official CBJ rate. Recognizing that the CBJ was not in a
position to support the JD at the official rate, on July 31, 1989, the
Government announced that the exchange rate to be used for commercial
transactions (accounting for about 80% of the import of goods and services)
would be floated.  The exchange rate used for the import of fifteen essential
commodities, and to pay for the expenses of students studying abroad, would
be the official CBJ rate.  These rates are to be unified, at the latest, by
March 1990 in line with the IMF agreement. As soon as this policy was
adopted in August 1989, the official rate was set at JD 0.57/US$, and the
market rate dropped to JD 0.83/US$.  As of November 1989, these rates had
moved closer to each other and were JD 0.63/US$ and JD 0.69/US$,
respectively, indicating a substantial depreciation of the JD vis-a-vis the
exchange rate of 0.33 JD/US$ in early 1988. 1/
1/ The nominal exchange rate of 0.54 JD/US$ prevailing in April 1989
amounted to a real effective depreciation of 23% from its value in
April 1988. Since then a further real depreciation could be expected due to
the nominal depreciation in August 1989.



-7-
(u)  Interesit Rates:
21.       During most of the 1980s, Jordan's financial system operated under
a fixed interest rate structure set by the CBJ. Inflation in Jordan,
however, has been very low (less than 5% p.a. between 1982 and 1987),
resulting in positive real interest rates. In late September 1988, the CBJ
decontrolled interest rates on consumer credit balances, call deposits and
all types of time deposits. The base lending rates on direct credit
facilities for resident customers in JD are fixed at 9% and for non-residents
at 12%. Lending rates, however, were actually deregulaLed, as banks were
free to charge commissions over and above these interest rates. In keeping
with the IMF's Stand-By Arrangement, the Government is in the process of
completing the necessary legislative and administrative procedures to free
the base lending rate, which will be freely determined by market forces.
D) Budgetary Policies:
22.       The 1989 budget emphasized austerity.  On the revenue side, average
income taxes were raised; rental income deductions were reduced; interest on
deposits outside Jordan was made taxable; tax exemptions for education
expenditures were restricted; a 10% surcharge was placed on hotel bills; the
airport tax was increased from 10 to 25 JD; and a 3% surcharge was placed on
airline tickets. On the expenditure side, all purchases of furniture and
vehicles were halted, regardless of the source of financing. For any
purchase above JD 50,000, approval from the Council of Ministers was
required. All expenditures on new infrastructure and service projects were
halted, and military expenditures were maintained at the 1988 level, in
nominal terms. By April 1989, however, it was evident that the favorable
impact of the above measures was largely offset by other factors. Budgetary
subsidies on wheat, barley, sugar, rice and powdered milk were projected to
reach JD 60 million (3% of GDP) by year-end, due to the Government's decision
not to raise their prices following the devaluation of the JD. Similarly, in
the absence of a price pass-through of devaluation, the profits from the sale
of petroleum products were projected to decline to JD 20 million, compared
with JD 68 million in 1988, and the banning of luxury imports reduced custom
receipts by about JD 23 million. In addition, interest payments on external
loans rose sharply due to large payments falling due and the depreciation of
the exchange rate; transfers to pensions were also higher due to the early
retirement of Jordanian teachers in the West Bank.
23.       Recognizing that its target of medium-term budgetary viability
would be jeopardized, the Government implemented additional measures in
mid-1989. These measures, which involved ad hoc increases in taxes on a
number of goods, should be thought of as emergency, interim, actions which
will be reviewed in the context of the overall rationalization of the tax
system currently underway. Together, these measures will have a projected
budgetary impact equivalent to 4.5% of GDP on an annual basis. They
included: (i) increases in domestic petroleum product prices ranging from 11%
to 33%; (ii) an average increase of 25% in the tax rate on local and imported
cigarettes; (iii) a 40%-50% tax increase on alcoholic drinks and an 18% tax
on soft drinks and mineral water; (iv) a 25% tax increase on detergents; (v)
a 67% increase in taxes on steel bars; (vi) new telephone charges; (vii) the
doubling of water charges in the Jordan Valley; (viii) increases in fees on
car registrations and licenses; and (ix) new royalty taxes on phosphate and



-8-
potash production. These measures were complemented by: a reduction in
subsidies on barley, bran, olive oil, and powdered milk made possible by
raising domestic retail prices; a reduction in, or the elimination of,
subsidies for production and exports; and a reduction in capital
expenditures. The likely budgetary impact of the most recent (August 1989)
changes in the exchange rate (para. 20) is still unclear. Given that the
rate has not changed for food imports, subsidies would be unaffected. The
burden of debt service would increase, but this is expected to be more than
compensated for by the likely increase in revenue from customs. The
Government is observing the situation closely and stands ready to take quick
corrective fiscal action if needed.
(iv) Idustry:
24.       In August 1988, the Government announced a number of measures to
improve the operating environment for industry. These included the abolition
of investment licensing, the elimination of import bans, and the
strengthening of institutional support for production and exports (details at
para. 55).
25.       The measures described above were designed to achieve financial
stabilization, as well as to shift incentives to exports and efficient
import-substituting activities. Since these policies have been in place for
only a short time, the response of the economy has been limited. While there
has been no across-the-board expansion in output, there is evidence that
markets are responding to the depreciation of the exchange rate.  For
instance, since late 1988, Jordanian manufacturers have signed large
contracts to supply garmenFJ to the USA and Canada. Abolishing the old
licensing system has resulted in over 1200 applications for new industries;
so far, however, only a few of these have resulted in actual investments.
Since August 1988, the Sahab Industrial Estate has signed on almost 60 new
tenants, compared to an ainual average since 1981 of only 15. Finally, the
Industrial Development Bank has seen a sharp increase in the demand for
credit for new projects in the first quarter of 1989.
26.       In sum, the adjustment problems facing Jordan are considerable.
The productive base is small, and reliance on grants and remittances cannot
be sustained in the changing, resource-constrained environmen:. Jordan's
budgetary and balance of payments situation is fragile, containing a number
of structural problems, and its external debt burden is high. On the
positive side, Jordan's trade and payments system, and its capital markets,
are relatively free and open. Also, Jordan has a well-functioning
infrastructure and has avoided the expansion of the public sector into
manufacturing, agricultural production, and agro-processing.
27.       The Government has been quite responsive and courageous in taking
measures to correct the rapidly deteriorating economic situation, and the
pace of reform is being maintained in the face of severe social discontent.
The measures implemented so far--aimed at reducing the budget deficit,
curtailing public and private consumption, and shifting resources to exports
and efficient import-substitution activities--have been in the right
direction. However, given the magnitude of adjustment needed, the Government
needs to accelerate the pace of reform and broaden its scope to restore
sustainable growth.



-9-
Part II. A MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
28.       The Government's main objective is to accelerate growth while
maintaining financial stability and protecting the economically
disadvantaged. Acceleration of growth in the Jordanian economy is critical,
not only to stem the recent decline in per capita income, but also to provide
employment for the country's growing labor force. A medium-term reform
program designed to achieve the Government's objectives would involve:
(i) reducing macroeconomic imbalances; (ii) generating growth by expanding
and diversifying exports; and (iii) protecting the poor during the adjustment
period. The main features of these reforms are discussed below and will be
summarized in the Letter of Development Policy (Annex III).
A.  Policies for Reducing Macroeconomic Imbalances
29.       A precondition for sustainable growth in Jordan is a reduction in
the present imbalance between the supply and demand of domestic, as well as
external, resources. Restoring balance would require policies that further
reduce the budget deficit and improve the management of external resources.
The Government has initiated a stabilization program, which has been
supported by an IMF Stand-By Arrangement over an eighteen-month period, to
implement these policies. The measures included in the program, some of
which have already been implemented, are indicated below.
30.       (i)  Reducing the Budget Deficit:  Growing budget deficits have
been at the heart of the financial imbalances facing the economy. Continuing
Jordan's fiscal deficit (including grants) at the 1988 level of about 14.7%
of GDP is clearly incompatible with available resources, This deficit should
not be financed with external borrowing, given Jordan's increased external
indebtedness. At the same time, financing the deficit by domestic borrowing
would "crowd out" private sector investment, as well as increase the burden
of debt service on future budgets. The medium-term framework adopted by the
Government (Table 2) calls for the deficit (including grants) to be reduced
from 14.7% in 1988 to 6% of GDP by 1993. 1/
31.       The Government has already implemented a set of measures
(see para. 23) which will reduce the budget deficit to 11.4% of GDP by
end-1989, thereby making substantial progress towards achieving the
medium-term target. A further reduction in the deficit, however, will
require structural changes to Jordan's revenue base and to the pattern of
expenditures. Jordan's revenue base is excessively dependent on import
duties and on non-tax revenues such as transfers from the public sector
telephone company and refinery. On average, during 1984-87, import duties
amounted to 50% of tax revenues, and non-tax revenue amounted to nearly 50%
of total domestic revenue. Jordan has no broad-based consumption or sales
1/  These targets were developed in May 1989 and were estimated at the
prevailing exchange rate of 0.54 JD/US$. Hence, they do not take into
account the exchange rate changes of August 1989 (para. 20). The
deficits were estimated assuming a full repayment of the debt service
due. The targets will be reviewed during the course of the IMF's
mid-term review in November 1989.

tax, and its income tax system is replete with exemptions which vitiate its
efficiency and equity.  Over the short term, the measures formulated by the
Government to redress these problems include (i) a continuous adjustment of
the customs evaluation rate to reflect the official exchange rate; (ii) an
increase in excise duties and a change in tariff rates from specific to ad
valorem; and (iii) the elimination of exemptions and tax loopholes. Over the
medium term, the Government recognizes that the main source of additional tax
revenues would have to be a general sales tax with a value-added format.
Preliminary work has already been done in this area by the Government, with
the assistance of the EEC and the USAID.  In August 1989, an IMF mission from
the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) completed a review of Jordan's revenue
system and identified further revenue entiancing measures to be implemented
over the medium term.
32.       The scope for reducing current expenditures is becoming
increasingly limited given the increasing share of debt service, pension and
social security payments, and the transfers to decentralized agencies with no
independent revenue sources in total expenditures. Further, while public
sector employment has grown by about 5% p.a. during 1983-87, the real wage
stagnated till 1987 and has since fallen sharply. Nevertheless, the
Government recognizes that it must continue to limit wages and public sector
employment, avoid subsidies, keep the rate of growth of expenditure on goods
and services below the rate of inflation, and control extra-budgetary
expenditures.  In addition, savings can be generated from the elimination of
budgetary transfers, excluding pensions, social security anid emergency relief
operations.  In spite of the decline in capital expenditures (in real terms)
during the past five years, the-projects included in the public investment
program need to be reassessed in terms of their contribution to growth and
diversification of trade.
33.       (ii)  Improving the Management of External Resources:  Emerging
imbalances in the external sector show that, even if Jordan were to achieve
modest gro%.th targets, its financing requirements would be substantial,
amounting to almost US$4.3 billion, or US$1.4 billion, p.a. over the next
three years (discussed in detail in para. 46). Managing Jordan's external
resources thus involves actions to expand exports and reduce imports,
complemented by efforts to raise concessional resources while keeping
rescheduling to a minimum. A key policy in improving the trade account is
the exchange rate. In the context of the Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF,
the Government is committed to following a flexible exchange rate policy and
to a unification of rates by March 1990, as has been discussed in para. 20.
34.       Given these substantial financing requirements, a viable reform
program should also include a cautious borrowing and debt-management
strategy.  In view of Jordan's high debt service burden, the Government has
set fairly stringent limits on commercial borrowing. '1oreover, the
Government has concluded a successful rescheduling of external debt owed the
Paris and the London Clubs. The Government has also asked the Bank to
examine the usefulness of organizing a donors' conference to raise the
financing needed for the adjustment program. The details of a financing
strategy are presented in paras. 44-50.



- 11 -
B.   Policies for Growth and the Nature of the Supply Response
35.       Jordan's future pattern of growth is likely to be very different
from that in the past and will call for a restructuring of the economy.
While past growth in consumption and investment relied upon the growing
availability of external resources in the form of grants and remittances,
future growth will have to rely upon expanding the productive base. While
past growth was based on expanding regional export markets, future growth
will have to cope with sluggish regional markets and will require penetrating
new markets. Unlike in the past, prospects for expanding the production of
Jordan's natural resource-based industries such as potash and phosphate are
limited. Currently planned investments in this sector are mainly designed to
increase value-added by the downstream processing of minerals. Thus, future
growth will have to originate in small- and medium-scale industries, in
agriculture, and in commercial services and be based on exports to
non-regional markets. This is possible only if the international
competitiveness of these sectors is increased substantially.
36.       The most important policy to increase the international
competitiveness of Jordanian goods and services has been the substantial real
depreciation of the exchange rate, which the Government has done since late
1988. As indicated above, there is already evidence of a positive supply
response from both exports ar.d efficient import substitution industries.
This policy needs to be followed up by a further rationalization of Jordan's
trade regime, which involves reducing the range of variation in tariff rates,
simplifying customs procedures and substituting tariffs for quantitative
restrictions (QRs) on luxury goods. Investment incentives also need to be
more sharply focussed on exports and become less discretionary.  These
policies would restructure incentives, making the economy responsive to
changes in the external environment and allowing resources to flow to sectors
in line with their comparative advantage--thereby laying the basis for growth.
37.       A restructuring of incentives, in order to be effective, needs to
be complemented by a strengthening of the institutions which support exports
and industrial production. As explained in detail in Part III, the thrust of
institutioial reform would be to reduce overlapping responsibilities and
strengthen the focus of existing arrangements, rather than create new
institutions. Towards this end: (i) the institutional responsibility for
export promotion needs to be clarified; (ii) the present system of providing
export finance needs to be improved; (iii) the administration of industrial
standards, currently done by twelve organizations, needs to be simplified and
improved; and (iv) the new institution resulting from the merger of the
Industrial Estates Corporation and the Free Zones Corporation needs to be
strengthened to improve the provision of services to entrepreneurs, as well
as to provide a focal point for export promotion.
C. Policies for Protecting the Poor
38.       The nature of poverty in Jordan is very different from that in
Asian or African countries. A long period of high growth, full employment,
and substantial public expenditures on social services during the 1970s
helped Jordan significantly reduce absolute levels of poverty, as well as
improve the country's distribution of income. Jordan enjoys universal
primary education; 902 of the population has access to electricity and safe



- 12 -
water in their homes; and there is very little evidence of widespread
malnutrition. Since 1982, however, the incidence of poverty has increased,
as a result of sluggish growth, narrowing opportunities for employment at
home and abroad and the high cost of migrating away from established family
structures. The poor in Jordan are thus disproportionately concentrated in
rural areas such as Maan and Karak in the south rather than in Amman. Poor
households also tend to have large families and have low productivity/low
income occupations.
39.       Over the medium term, the proposed reform program can be expected
tc have a positive impact on the poor in Jordan. Reforms would restructure
the economy and expand the productive base, which in turn would increase
domestic employment. In addition, maintaining a competitive exchange rate
would help Jordanians expand their share of the regional labor market in
teachers, health workers, and public administration professionals. In the
short run, however, the adjustment program could adversely affect the poor.
The restructuring of production set in motion by the adjustment policies
could result in an increase in unemployment, unless retraining programs are
instituted in parallel. The growth in public sector employment will be
curtailed as a result of a compression in government spending, and
expenditures on critical social services could be jeopardized as a result of
cutbacks in public expenditures.
40.       The Government has adopted a comprehensive program to protect the
poor during the adjustment period. The first, and in some ways most
significant, element of the government program consists of reorienting and
improving the efficiency of existing government and non-government
organizations already engaged in helping the poor (discussed in detail in
Part III). The Bank would (i) assist in creating an apex agency to
coordinate and improve the efficiency of the existing network of
organizations; (ii) help the Government formulate a medium-term strategy for
helping the poor; and (iii) provide seed money to raise additional bilateral
resources. Second, the Public Expenditure Review, to be carried out with the
assistance of the Bank, would be designed to protect expenditures on basic
social services such as health, education and low income housing in addition
to rationalizing recurrent expenditures and improving the efficiency of
public investment. Third, the Government would strengthen the job search and
placement capacity of the Ministry of Labor and devise schemes for on-the-job
training to improve the employment prospects of Jordanians. The Government
is currently working with the Bank on a Human Resources Developmer,t Project,
recently approved by the Board, to enhance the quality, flexibility and,
hence, the employability of Jordan's workforce, as well as with the ILO and
the UNDP to create a labor market information system and to improve the
effectiveness of vocational training facilities.
D. Macroeconomic Framework
41.       Even with the successful implementation of the program described
above, Jordan's growth prospects are expected to be modest, as indicated in
Table 2. The real GDP growth rate would accelerate to about 4.0% p.a. by
1992, while the rate of domestic inflation is projected to decline roughly to
the same level as international inflation (6.5% p.a. by 1993). Manufacturing
is expected to be the lead sector, growing by nearly 5.5% p.a. by 1993;
agriculture would grow more slowly at 3.5% p.a.; and services would grow more
or less in line with the increase in population.



- 13 -
42.       Projections for the balance of payments are consistent with the
projections of the GDP. Exports are projected to grow by 4.5% p.a. ove-
1988-93, higher than the growth of GDP. The main sources of this growth,
fruits and vegetables and manufactured products, are expected to grow by 5%
and 7%, respectively. This pattern of growth reflects gains in
competitiveness and the outward orientation of the economy as a result of the
real depreciation of the exchange rate since late 1988. Imports are
projected to grow slowly during 1990-91. After this, growth accelerates to
about 3.6% p.a. During the initial period, the slow growth of imports can be
attributed to the substitution of imports by domestically produced goods in
consumption and production and the existence of excess capacity following a
period of negative or low output growth. The import intensity of production
during this period can generally be expected to be lower than during a period
in which capacity expansion is necessary to increase output. Beyond 1991,
the import elasticity with respect to GDP stabilizes at around 0.9, which is
lower than the 1.5 observed during 1984-88 and reflects the expected gains in
efficiency from the ieform program over the medium term. Workers'
remittances are linked to the Bank's projections for oil prices, and grants
are projected to grow by 3.1% p.a. in nominal terms. With these assumptions,
the projections indicate that the current account deficit (excluding grants)
could be gradually reduced from a very high initial level of 19.4% of GDP in
1989 to less than half this value by 1993, and reduced further still to 2.8%
of GDP by 1998 (Annex II).
43.       In spite of the steady decline in the current account deficit,
Jordan's financing requirements will be substantial and will have to be met,
as much as possible, on concessional terms. The gross financing required to
finance the current account deficit before grants, the debt service payments
on old and new debt, and a modest build up of external reserves to one and a
half months of imports is estimated to decline from about US$1.6 billion in
1989 to about US$1.1 billion by 1998 (Table 3). Of this amount,
disbursements on regular borrowing I/ could be expected to contribute about
US$460 million in 1989 increasing to about US$570 million in 1998, and
concessionary resources, including grants, could be expected to contribute
about US$600 million p.a. This would leave about US$1.3 billion to be
mobilized during 1989-92 as exceptional financing consisting of debt
rescheduling and resources from the Bank and the IMF. The interest and
amortization on all exceptional financing is included in the calculation of
the projected debt service payments. Creditworthiness and a detailed
three-year financing plan are discussed below.
44.       External Debt and Creditworthiness:  Despite the large debt burden
in 1988, the projections indicate that Jordan would be able to service its
debt and achieve a sustainable balance of payments. This would basically be
the result of a strong structural adjustment program which would lead to a
rapid correction of the present macroeconomic imbalances and, over the medium
term, result in an expansion of the production of exportables and import
substitutes.

45.       Although some of Jordan's current creditworthiness indicators
appear alarmingly high when compared to those of other highly indebted
countries, these indicators need to be interpreted in light of Jordan's
special circumstances. To begin with, Jordan's current high indebtedness
should be viewed in light of the rapid depreciation of the exchange rate that
has taken place during 1988/89.  In 1988 Jordan's debt/GNP and the
interest/GNP ratios were 1442 and 7%, respectively (Table 4).  By 1989 these
are projected to increase to 2462 and 12.5%. Almost all the increase in
these ratios can, however, be attributed to the downward adjustment of the
GNP in US dollar terms due to the change in the exchange rate (Annex II).
Such high ratios translate into unsustainably large debt servicing burdens in
other highly indebted countries. In Jordan, exports of goods and services
(including workers' remittances) are an unusually high proportion of GNP
compared to other countries. They amounted to 70% of GNP in 1988 and are
projected to be 120% of GNP in 1990, compared to 23% of GNP for Turkey, 30%
for Morocco and 10% for Brazil. Such a high exports/GNP ratio, combined with
the fact that a large proportion of Jordan's debt is contracted at
concessional terms, means that the debt service to exports ratios could
quickly return to a sustainable level in response to a strong adjustment
effort. As indicated in Table 4, the financing strategy involves limiting
the stock of debt to around US$8 billion which implies a reduction of
debt/GNP ratio from a maximum of about 260% in 1'90 to 98% by 1998. Jordan's
scheduled debt service ratios in 1989 and 1990 are unsustainably high
necessitating debt rescheduling. This situation, however, improves rapidly;
after only a short period of modest rescheduling, the debt service ratio
falls below 30X by 1993 and 20% by 1998, i.e., well below the levels which
triggered the accumulation of debt service arrears (Table 4).
46.       Three-Year Financing Plan: The Government is currently putting
together a three-year (1989-91) financing plan to mobilize an estimated
US$4.3 billion. Of this amount, regular borrowing could be expected to
contribute about US$1.4 billion, leaving about US$2.9 billion to be financed
by a mix of concessional resources including grants, rescheduling of external
debt and multilateral sources of finance.  1/
47.       Rescheduling:  The Government has already concluded an agreement to
resche'.ule the external debt owed to the members of the Paris Club and
reached a tentative agreement with the members of the London Club. At the
Paris Club, 100% of the principal falling due from July 1, 1989 through
December 31, 1990 and 50X of the interest falling due from July 1, 1989
through December 31, 1989 on MLT debts contracted before January 1, 1989 were
rescheduled. Also rescheduled were 1002 of the principal and interest
arrears, as of June 30, 1989, on the same obligations. The above amounts
were rescheduled on standard Paris Club terms: viz., 10-year maturity,
including 5 years of grace, at market interest rates. 2/ At the London Club,
1/   While the underlying projections are the same, a slightly different
presentation is found in the Letter of Development Policy, attached as
Annex III. The gross resources required are estimated at about US$4.3
billion (or US$1.43 billion p.a. over the three years 1989-91). Of this
amount, US$1.4 billion could be obtained from regular borrowing and
about US$1.0 billion from regular grants, which would leave a gap of
about US$1.9 billion that the Government proposes to raise from debt
rescheduling, multilateral institutions, and concessional resources from
traditional bilateral donors.
2/   Concessional loans are projected to be rescheduled at their original
interest rates.

only the principal payments falling due between January 1, 1989 and June 30,
1991 were rescheduled at 11.5 years maturity, including 5 years of grace.
48.      If Jordan makes a maximum utilization of its debt rescheduling
possibilities, its repayments would be reduced by about US$600 million
p.a. 1/ in 1989 and 1990, respectively, which, together with disbursements on
regular borrowing, and resources from the World Bank and the IMF, would be
sufficient to meet projected gross financing requirements in 1989 and 1990.
However, a decision to rely predominantly on debt rescheduling to finance the
balance of payments during the initial years would place a heavier burden of
debt service payments on Jordan's future balance of payments. As an
illustration: if full utilization of debt rescheduling on current terms
amounting to roughly US$600 million p.a. is made during the first four years
(1989-92) to finance the gaps, 2/ the debt service ratio would increase on
average between 2 to 3 percentage points every year beyond 1994 and would
result in a substantial weakening of the balance of payments. It would thus
be in the interest of Jordan's future growth prospects to minimize recourse
to rescheduling as much as possible and to rely increasingly on multilateral
and concessional sources of finance. The f.nancing strategy presented in
Table 3 assumes that only US$850 million (instead of about US$2 billion that
is possible over 1989-91), i.e, about 20% of Jordan's financing requirements
of US$4.3 billion over 1989-91, would be met by rescheduling its external
debt and the remainder by a mix of multilateral and concessional sources of
finance (see para. 50).
49.      Multilateral Sources:  First, Jordan has concluded a Stand-By
Arrangement with the IMF which,-together with the compensatory financing
facility, could amount to about US$100 million over a one and a half year
period. Second, the Bank's proposed adjustment loan (AL) would contribute
US$150 million (see para. 95 for the relationship of this loan to overall
Bank strategy). Given the magnitude of financing required and the potential
availability of assistance from other donors, a second Bank policy-based
quick-disbursing operation (of US$50 million) is envisaged. Assuming this
second Bank quick-disbursing loan and a repetition of the IMF Stand-By
Arrangement in the third year, the resources made available to Jordan by the
Bank (other than for project lending) and the IMF would amount to about
US$340 million over the next three years.
50.      Concessional Resources: As discussed in para. 48, if the Government
were to fully utilize its debt rescheduling possibilities, together with the
World Bank and the IMF, the projected balance of payment gaps in 1989-91
would be fully financed. However, in case the Government were to adopt for
1989-91 the financing strategy outlined in Table 3, i.e., reschedule US$850
million, obtain US$1.4 billion as regular borrowing and US$340 million from
the Bank and IMF, it would need to raise about US$1.7 billion, or about
US$570 million p.a. over the next three years at concessional terms. This,
while challenging, is a feasible assumption for the following reasons.
First, the Government has already succeeded in obtaining firm commitments for
grants amounting to about US$560 million in 1989 and has so far identified
US$340 million in 1990. Second, there are strong possibilities of
cofinancing for the proposed AL from the Governments of Japan (US$150 million
equivalent) and the Federal Republic of Germany (US$17 million equivalent).

PART III. THE PROPOSED INDUSTRY AND TRADE POLICY ADJUSTMENT LOAN (AL)
A.     Backround
51.      During the President's visit to Jordan in November 1988, the
Government requested Bank support for an adjustment program designed to
reverse the rapidly deteriorating economy. An exploratory mission in
December confirmed the Government's commitment to the program. A preparation
mission, which included two staff members from the IMF, visited Jordan in
February 1989. The mission assessed the macroeconomic situation and helped
the Government put various ongoing initiatives into a comprehensive reform
program. A Stand-By Arrangement was approved by the Fund's Board in July
1989 for an amount of SDR 60 million over an eighteen-month period,
equivalent to 55% of Jordan's quota on an annual basis.  In addition,
drawings under the Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facility of about
SDR 40 million were also approved. The proposed operation was appraised by
the Bank in June 1989, and negotiations were held between October 28 and
November 2, 1989.
B.     Description of the Proposed Operation
52.      The proposed loan is designed to support the Government's
medium-term adjustment program described in Part II; a number of elements of
the program have already been, or are being, implemented. The proposed loan
would help restructure public expenditures, improve the incentive framework
for exports and efficient import substitution, and strengthen institutions in
support of industry and trade (see the letter of Development Policy and
Policy Matrix in Annexes III and IV). The proposed loan also initiates an
immediate, as well as long-range, program of actions to protect the poor from
the adverse impact of adjustment policies. Moreover, as discussed in Part
II, the Bank's financial contribution is a critical component of the
Government's financing plan for 1989 and 1990. Finally, the Bank would, if
necessary, organize a consultative group to alert the participants to
Jordan's need for concessional resources to substitute for expensive debt
reschedulings. In sum, the measures included under the AL could be
classified as policies to:
ensure a competitive and stable macroeconomic environment;
improve the competitiveness and efficiency of industry and trade; and
protect the poor during the adjustment period.
(i)    Macroeconomic Policies
53.      Maintaining a competitive and stable macroeconomic environment over
the medium term is critical to the success of the reform program.  The IMF
Stand-By Arrangement is designed to establish a balance of payments and
fiscal framework necessary for improved macroeconomic performance. The
program supported by the Bank includes actions to complement the measures
taken under the IMF Stand-By Arrangement.
54.      An important element of the Bank's dialogue on macroeconomic issues
is a Public Expenditure Review (PER), to be carried out before the release of
the second tranche. This review will analyze trends in the economy's overall



- 19 -
resource balance, in addition to making a detailed analysis of different
components of public expenditures. As discussed in para. 30, a reduction in
the budget deficit is at the core of Jordan's adjustment efforts. While the
proposed macroeconomic framework included in the AL indicates the overall
budget reduction targets, further detailed analysis is needed to determine
how the burden of adjustment will be shared between revenues and
expenditures. The program agreed with the IMF includes an analysis of
Jordan's tax system to be carried out by the IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department
(FAD). The Bank will complement this review by carrying out a detailed
analysis of public expenditures. To provide a framework for this exercise
the Government has outlined the key elements of its expenditure reduction
strategy. These include (i) reduction of the wage bill, subsidies and
defense expenditures as a proportion of GDP; (ii) rationalization of the
public investment program by including only projects which meet well defined
criteria; and (iii) protection of critical expenditures on health, education
and social services. During the course of the PER, the strategy outlined
above will be developed further and agreed upon with the Government as a
condition of the second tranche release.
(u)   Policy Reforms in Industry and Trade
55.      The policy reforms in industry and trade included in the AL can be
seen as a continuation of a process that has been underway for the past year
and a half. The Bank has been an active participant in this process through
many years of economic and sector work, culminating in a recent report on
manufacturing industry (para. 2). The Government has already implemented a
number of measures, many of which are in keeping with the recommendations in
this report. In sum, it has:
abolished the investment licensing system;
 established a special unit in the Ministry of Industry to help
Jordanian and foreign investors set up enterprises within Jordan;
announced a policy that all requests for investment incentives would
be processed in less than one month;
replaced import bans on almost all competitive imports with tariffs;
anrd simultaneously abolished all price controls on domestically
produced items that were protected by import bans. (However, in
December 1988 import bans on 11 luxury items not produced in Jordan
were instituted for a period of one year, in order to save foreign
exchange);
allowed trading companies all the incentives and duty exemptions
granted to manufacturers (exporters); and
taken the decision to merge the Free Zones Corporation and the
Industrial Estates Corporation.
56.      The program supported by the AL would build upon the measures
already implemented to improve the competitiveness of industry and
trade---the two critical sources of growth in the Jordanian economy.  rhe
measures to be implemented under the AL could be classified as follows:



- 20 -
. Trade Reform
. Reform of the Encouragement of Investment (EI) Law
. Reform of Institutions in Support of Industry to include:
. Rationalizing Arrangements for Export Finance
. Fixing Institutional Responsibility for Export
Promotion
. Strengthening Industrial Infrastructure
. Strengthening Industrial Standards
(a) Trade Reform:
57.      A reform of the trade regime is needed to translate the gains in
competitiveness, resulting from the improved macro framework, into increased
output. QRs need to be removed; trading procedures, simplified; and the wide
variation in protection provided by existing tariff rates, reduced.
58.      Since the Government started its trade reform with the assistance of
the Baak, QRs on competitive imports have been largely eliminated. The
Government's plan to eliminate the existing QRs on 11 luxury items by
end-1989 will have reduced the percentage- of domestic manufacturing protected
by QRs from 40% in early 1988 to less than 7% in 1990. 1/
59.      The Government also intends to simplify the tariff system by the
introduction of the Harmonized System 2/, a shift from specific to ad valorem
rates, with these rates multiples of 5%.
60.      Under the proposed operation, the Government will address the major
item remaining on the trade reform agenda, i.e., the rationalization of the
tariff structure.  Even in this area, the Government has made considerable
progress by drastically reducing tariff exemptions. In 1988, when the Bank's
analysis was done, nearly 30 institutions were exempt from paying any import
duties; as a result, nearly 51% of total imports came into the country
without paying any tariffs. This created different retail prices for the
same good for different consumers, without any economic rationale, and placed
the domestic producers of goods imported tariff free at a disadvantage
vis-a-vis imports. During 1988, the Government removed a number of
institutions from the exempt status. The only institutions still exempt are
those with security considerations or those protected by international
agreements. In addition, the Government has developed a list of
domestically produced goods on which even exempted on institutions have to
pay the full tariff. As a result of these measures, the proportion of
imports coming into Jordan exempted from tariffs is expected to decline to
37% in 1989.
1/   The only import bans to remain in force after 1989 are on four basic
products (table salt, tomato paste, milk and mineral water) and amount
to less than 2% of the value of the manufacturing sector's production.
In addition, cigaret:e imports are restricted to 10% of domestic
produztion. Details in Annex V.
2/   The Harmonized System is the tariff nomenclature system established by
the international convention on the harmonized commodity coding and
description system, which entered into force on January 1, 1988.



- 21 -
61.       The Government will complemert these measures by reducing the
variation in tariffs by lowering the maximum and raising the minimum, as
shown in Table 5.  Jordan's present tariff structure shows a very high degree
of variability, with tariff rates between 0 and about 318%.  Such a high
degree of variation in tariff rates creates an even higher variation in
effective rates of protection and leads to a structure of production which is
not *in line with the country's comparative advantage. Moreover, it raises
the cost of production in Jordanian industries, which makes it difficult to
expand exports and promote efficient import substitution, and puts a cost
burden on consumers.
62.       In designing the tariff re.orm, the Government is as constrained by
the need to protect revenues from customs duties as it is handicapped by the
undeveloped nature of its domestic caxing capacity.  Therefore, the lowering
of high tariffs will be synchronized with the raising of low tariffs so that
the average tariff is unchanged. Threo groups of commodities will require
special treatment.  First, tariffs On d shortlist of goods, primarily mass
consumption items amounting tc f.5t of dutiable imports, would continue to
remain zero. The main items on this list are capital goods (3.6% of the
dutiable imports), cereals (1.8%), books and newspapers (0.6%), and gold for
financial transactions (0.5%) . The inclusion of capital goods in this list
is seen as an integral part of the recently announced liberalization of
investment controls: all investment licensing was removed and a cumbersome,
discretionary tariff exemption approval process was replaced by setting all
tariffs on capital goods to zero.  Second, the tariffs on a shortlist of
luxury goods, for which there are no similar domestically produced items,
will also remain unchanged (see Annex V). Third, for a list of luxury goods
for which there are similar domestically produced items (see Annex V), the
total tariff would be split into a basic tariff and a supplemental tax.  The
tariff would be subject to the same maximum as other goods.  The supplemental
tax on imports would be collected at customs while a tax on similar
domestically produced items would be introduced in conjunction with a
broad-based consumption tax, which is currently under discussion with the
IMF. We have obtained assurance from the Government that the objectives of
the trade reform will be protected as this consumption tax is introduced.
Before the release of the second tranche, the Government will furnish the
Bank with a program specifying the future steps and timing for the equal
taxation of imported and domestically produced items under the new tax regime.
63.       For the remaining 80% of the items subject to tariffs, the
Government plans to reduce the range between the maximum and minimum tariffs
to 45 percentage points over the next two years, as shown in Table 5. The
reduction in variation can be seen by the fall in stanidard deviation, while
the revenue effect using import elasticities in the projections is basically
neutral. The reform process will be sustained by further narrowing the
difference over the next two to three years, at a pace and to a level that

will be determined by the revenue and resource allocation impact of the
initial adjustment.
(b) Rationalizing Incentives for Investment:
64.     The Jordanian Government has traditionally provided incentives for
investment through the Encouragement of Investment (EI) Law. The EI Law,
along with the investment licensing system, has been used to direct
investment to specif> sectors. The EI Law provides income tax and customs
duty exemptions to selected investment projects. A rationalization of
investment incentives would involve a movement away from administratively
directing investments to specific sectors. The abolition of the investment
licensing system was the first big step in this direction. As a condition of
effectiveness of the Bank loan, the EI Law would be reformulated. The
present system of providing investment incentives would be replaced with a
simpler, less discretionary, system which would be more focussed on exports.
Under the revised system: (i) qualifying criteria to determine eligibility of
projects tor investment incentives would be reduced; (ii) a number of
discretionary elements in the EI Law would be eliminated and others made
automatic; and (iii) decision making would be streamlined in order to reduce
processing time.
(c) Reform of nstitutions in Support of Industry:
65.     Rationalizing Arrarngements for Export Finance:  For several years the
CBJ has operated an export rediscounting facility (EDF), which has financed
about 35% of the value of manufactured exports. Under this facility, funds
are made available to all exporters at an interest rate of between 3%-4%.
There are basically two problems with this system. First, the rate of
rediscount was fixed when the interest rates were between 7%-8%.  The
rediscount rate has remained at the same level while interest rates have
risen to above 11%, thus increasing the interest rate margin to above 7% and
resulting in a large subsidy co exporters. Second, the EDF has been used as
a passive instrument and is not regarded by the Government as a means to
diversify exports into difficult markets. As a condition of the
effectiveness of the Bank loan, the Government has agreed to redress these
shortcomings by taking the following steps:
The current average interest rate margin to exporters would be
reduced to about 5% and held constant by changing the rate of
discount to reflect the commercial lending rate. This would not only
bring the discount rate subsidy more in line with that of other
countries, it would also ensure that the cost of capital to exporters
reflects the cost of capital in the economy.
The EDF would be used to diversify exports by offering a lower
discount rate for exports destined for non-traditional markets
compared to those destined for regional markets.
66.     The CBJ is considering alternative forms of institutional
arrangements to finance exports over the medium term and is carrying out a
study with assistance from the USAID. Terms of reference for this study have
been prepared and reviewed by the Bank; a contract for consultants has been
signed and the study is underway. The Government has agreed to implement the
study's proposed recommendations by second tranche based on discussions with
the Bank.



- 23 -
6 7.    Fbding Institutional Responsibility for Export and ' nvestment Promotion: The
responsibility for export and investment promotion is currently shared by the
Ministry of Industry and Trade, the Jordan Commercial Centers Corporation
(JCCC), and the Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Recognizing the need for
stronger leadership, the Government has announced plans to create a "Higher
Export Council". An interministerial task force has also been established to
study export issues.
68.     Under the proposed AL, the Bank would assist the Government in
developing an overall export and investment strategy. The Bank would also
assist the Government in undertaking a study to determine the institutional
structure required to organize, coordinate and manage such a strategy. This
study would assess the capacity of existing organizations to implement the
strategy and would recommend an action program of effective export and
investment promotion. It would be carried out in conjunction with the study
on the merger of the Free Zones Corporation and Industrial Estates
Corporation described below.
69.     Strengthening Industrial Infrastructure Two institutions which play a
major role in supporting industry are the Industrial Estates Corporation
(IEC) and the Free Zones Corporation (FZC). The IEC runs industrial estates,
providing aspiring industrialists with a standard factory unit, electricity
and water. The IEC also helps with obtaining the necessary clearances from
the Government for proposed investments. The FZC basically provides a bonded
warehousing facility for transit trade. The Government has recently decided
to merge the IEC and FZC with a view to providing better service to domestic
and foreign investors. Draft legislation establishing a successor
organization has been prepared. The new legislation has a number of
shortcomings. It does not harmonize the two existing bye-laws governing IEC
and FZC or take into consideration possible changes in the operations of the
organization which would result from the merger.
70.     Before promulgating any new legislation, the Government needs to
decide on the future role, developmental strategy, and institutional
structure of the new organization in order to ensure that it is established
on a sound commercial basis and can provide improved services to
entrepreneurs. The Bank would assist the Government in carrying out a study
to review these issues. On the basis of this study, the Government would
develop an action plan with a timetable for the merger and the establishment
of an effective national investment and export promotion program. Terms of
reference for the study have been prepared in consultation with the Bank.
Conclusions and recommendations of the study would be discussed, and an
action program agreed upon with the Bank, prior to second tranche release.
71.     Improving Industrial Standards:  The absence of well-defined industrial
standards is another weakness of the Jordanian institutional infrastructure.
There are presently 10 organizations with laboratories engaged in
standards-related testing and 11 organizations which issue regulations in
their area of jurisdiction. This situation results in overlap and the
duplication of established metrology, standardization, testing and
quality-control (MSTQ) facilities. Furthermore, almost all these facilities
are in Amman, which leads to delays in the inspection, testing and clearance
of imports and exports.



- 24 -
72.     The Government has recently completed an analysis of the Jordanian
standards system with the assistance of the GTZ. It has also sought
assistance from the GTZ and the EEC to prepare proposals for building
institutional capability, as well as for preparing specifications. Under the
proposed AL, the Bank would evaluate ongoing efforts and assist in defining
an action program.
(HO)  Protecting the Poor Duwing Adjustment
73.      As discussed above, the proposed AL includes two ways to protect the
poor during adjustment. First, the public expenditure review would protect
critical expenditures on health, education and social services going to the
poor. Second, the AL would assist in formulating a phased program to improve
the coordination and efficiency of government and non-government
organizations engaged in assisting the poor.
74.      Jordan is fortunate in having a large network of government and
non-government organizations (NGOs) with a mandate to serve the poor. While
this network is extensive, it is beset with a number of problems. Taken as a
whole, the agencies exhibit a bias towards welfare rather than developmental
work. The system is thus more suited to taking care of orphans, widows and
handicapped persons, by direct or indirect financial support, than to
creating productive employment opportunities. There is also a lack of
developmental activities aimed at women. Daycare centers, kindergartens,
community based health care, education, school meals, etc. are crucial to
women's entrance into the job market and, in more general terms, to the
success of the health and education programs. In addition, welfare
organizations remain overwhelmingly concentrated in Amman, while the poor are
mainly in rural areas. The present system also suffers from a lack of
coordination. There is a great deal of duplication among institutions, and
the demarcation of responsibilities (even among Government agencies) is not
always clear. Finally, the agencies on the whole are underfunded.
75.      The problems described above point to the need for an apex agency to
increase efficiency by improving the coordination among existing agencies.
Emphasis needs to be shifted from welfare to developmental activities,
especially those related to women. The Government proposes to introduce such
an agency in two phases: phase one would be included under the proposed AL,
and phase two would be developed as a free-standing project expected to be
presented to the Board before the end of FY90. In phase one the proposed
institution would be established and would provide initial support to other
existing agencies; the following three studies would also be carried out.
The first study would address organizational and management issues
determining the detailed structure, procedures and staffing requirements for
the five directorates of the apex agency. The second would identify
marketing problems facing productive projects that are being planned and
implemented by the existing agencies and pro4ect sponsors. It would then
make recommendations on the capabilities and procedures that the apex agency
will need in order to address these problems. The third study would
conduct



- 25 -
an inventory of the geographical and functional coverage of agencies/projects
serving the poor: which kinds of projects are being operated in which
govrernorates and cities and, more particularly, where are the main gaps and
duplications in services. These findings would be used to set priorities for
new activities. In phase two, the apex institution would be fully
operational and would help the other existing agencies promote, appraise and
implement projects. For this phase, a project is being prepared with the
assistanLe of the Bank.
76.      An agreement has been reached on the terms of reference and dates of
completion for the studies included in phase one (para. 84) and on key
criteria, as indicated in Annex VIII, to be adhered to in establishing the
apex agency. On this basis, the Government has already prepared a draft
legislaticn to create the apex agency for consideration by the cabinet; a
decision on this issue is expected soon. We expect that the Government would
officially establish the apex agency and adopt an action plan in consultation
with the Bank by second tranche.
77.      Financing requirements for the first phase would be modest.  About
US$1.0 million would be set aside from the proposed AL for the development of
the apex agency and for financial and technical assistance to the existing
agencies and studies. There is interest among donors to cofinance this
component of the AL. Depending upon donor response, the Bank proceeds could
also be used in phase one for onlending to a set of projects to support a
first set of beneficiaries. Raising resources from bilateral donors (by the
Bank as well as the apex agency) to start full-scale onlending in phase two
would be a critical activity during the first phase. The financing for phase
two would mainly consist of bilateral funds for onlending amounting to a
total of about US$15 million, with a possible Bank contribution of up to a
maximum of about US$10 million depending on donor response.
C.  Administrative Arrangements
78.      Loan Amount and Borrower.  Of the proposed loan of US$150 million,
US$148.5 million would finance the foreign exchange cost of general imports;
US$0.5 million would finance the technical assistance (TA) program in
industry and trade (para. 84); and US$1.0 million, the program to protect the
poor (paras. 73-76). The proposed loan would be made to the Government of
Jordan, which would make US$148.5 million available to the Central Bank of
Jordan (CBJ) to administer and disburse the funds against eligible imports.
The remaining US$1.5 million would be administered by the Ministry of
Planning. The portion of the loan used to finance imports would be disbursed
in two tranches. The first tranche of US$75 million would be available upon
effectiveness; the second tranche of US$73.5 million, upcn fulfillment of the
second tranche release conditions, which is expected eight months after the
release of the first tranche. The remaining US$1.5 million would be
disbursed against the programs to be administered by the Ministry of Planning.
79.      Cofinancing.  As indicated above, the Government is putting together
a financing plan for the next three years. Towards this end, the Government
is seeking financing from the Governments of Japan and the Federal Republic
of Germany.



- 26 -
80.      Procurement.  The portion of the proposed loan to be administered by
CBJ (para. 78) would finance all goods to be imported except a list of
excluded goods, such as military or para-military items, luxury goods,
alcoholic beverages, tobacco, nuclear reactors and parts, and uranium.  Both
private and public sector imports would be eligible for financing if procured
through one of the following procedures:  (i) for large value contracts
(exceeding US$5 million) of public and private sectors, simplified
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures would be followed;
(ii) for public sector procurement valued below the ICB threshhold of US$5
mill.on, Jordanian public procurement procedures would be followed provided
they are consistent with Bank guidelines; (iii) for private sector purchases
valued between US$2 million and US$5 million, contracts would be awarded on
the basis of comparison of quotations obtained from two suppliers from two
countries; and (iv) for private sector purchases valued below US$2 million,
the established commercial practices would be followed, provided, whenever
possible, quotations from two suppliers from two countries are obtained. All
contracts would be subjezt to ex-post review.
Disbursements
81.      The use of the loan proceeds for the procurement of petroleum
products or foodstuffs would be limited to a maximum of US$30 million each.
Retroactive financing would be permitted up to US$29 million for expenditures
made after September 1, 1989, or about four months before the expected date
of signing.
82.      The CBJ would be responsible for collecting appropriate supporting
documentation, the preparation and submission of withdrawal applications, and
the maintenance of necessary accounts for the loan funds. In order to
facilitate disbursement, a Special Account would be established at the CBJ
under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The initial deposit
would be US$15 million.  Reimbursements for expenditures to be funded from
the Special Account would be accompanied by a Summary Statement and a copy of
the CBJ Summary of the Special Account since the previous application, with
the balance certified by the CBJ.  Contracts above US$2 million would be
fully documented. For contracts valued between US$100,000 and US$2 million,
withdrawal applications would be supported by statements of expenditures.
These would be submitted by CBJ detailing individual transactions by SITC
group and source, together with a certification of the amounts involved.
These documents would be retained by CBJ for one year after the closing date
for subsequent audit and review. Disbursements against existing licenses
(not to exceed 10% of the loan) for imports of small value items between
US$10,000 and US$100,000 would be reimbursed through separate statements of
expenditure. No reimbursements would be made for expenditures for goods
procured under contracts of less than US$10,000. The closing date for
disbursements would be 24 months after loan signature.
83.      Accounting and Auditing.  The operation's account, including the
Special Account, would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank and the annual audit report would be submitted to the Bank within six
months of the end of each fiscal year. The audit report would include a
statement verifying that amounts disbursed against statements of expenditure
were used for the purpose they were intended. The auditors' report would
include an opinion on whether satisfactory procedures were in operation at
the CBJ regarding the use of Statements of Expenditure.



- 27 -
84.      Technical Assistance.  A TA program is included in the proposed
operation to help the Government carry out the studies indicated below. The
terms of reference (TOR) for these studies and their timing have been agreed
upon. The program would encompass:
(i)    A study to merge the Industrial Estates Corporation (IEC) and the
Free Zones Corporation (FZC) and to prepare an export and
investment promotion strategy (para. 70);
(ii)   A review of Industrial Standards (para. 71);
(iii) A review of the institutional arrangements in export finance
(para. 66);
(iv)   An Organiza.ion and Management Study to determine the optimal
s.ructure and procedures of the apex agency for protecting the
poor  (para. 76);
(v)    A marketing study to identify productive project marketing needs
and possible bottlenecks for small-scale activities (para. 76);
and
(vi)   An inventory of the geographical and functional coverage of
agencies serving the poor (para. 76).
Studies (i) to (iii) are estimated to cost a maximum of US$0.5 million; cost
estimates for studies (iv) to (vi) are included in the costs of the social
impact component (details at Annex IX). The actual disbursements on this
component would, however, depend upon the funds the Government is able to
raise from bilateral sources on concessional terms. Procurement of
consulting services would be conducted according to Bank guidelines where
these are financed by the Bank.
8.5.     Implementation and Monitoring.  The Ministry of Planning will be
responsible for the implementation of the proposed operation. The Bank would
monitor the progress of program implementation through regular supervision
and consultations with the Government. As part of this process, the
Government would periodically prepare status reports. Prior to the release
of the second tranche, the Bank would carry out an overall assessment of the
progress on macroeconomic policies, as well as other actions supported by the
AL. The first status report of the Government and the PER would be used as
inputs to the mid-term review, which in turn would form the basis for the
release of the second tranche of the loan. Not later than six months after
the closing date of the Bank loan, the Government would prepare and furnish
to the Bank a project completion report.
D.       Loan Conditions
86.    In the past two months the Government has implemented a number of
policy measures that were originally expected to be implemented later on
during the course of the operation. The TOR for all the studies mentioned in
para. 84 have been finalized and preliminary work, such as identifying
consultants, is underway. The Government has also prepared a draft
legi3lation for creating the apex agency (para. 76) for consideration by the
cabinet and has completed the preliminary work for conducting a living
standard measurement survey.
87.    Proposed conditions of effectiveness of the Bank loan are:



- 28 -
(i)    agreement on Terms of Reference for the Public Expenditure Review
(PER) (para. 54);
(ii)   the Government announcement for the reduction of maximum tariffs to
60% and increase of the minimum tariff to 5X. A list consisting of
capital goods, cereals and a few other items presented in Annex V
will continue to have zero tariffs and a list consisting of luxury
import goods for which no similar goods are produced domestically
will continue to have high tariffs.   In addition, for a list of
luxury goods provided in Annex V, for which similar goods are
produced domestically, the total tariff would be split into a basic
tariff and a supplemental tax. The tariff would be subject to the
same maximum as ott,er goods. The supplemental tax on imports would
be collected at customs while a tax on similar domestically produced
items would be introduced in conjunction with a broad-based
consumption tax, which is currently under discussion with the IMF
(paras. 62-63);
(iii) revisions to the EI Law including: rationalizing the qualifying
criteria used to determine eligibility of projects for investment
incentives; eliminating a number of discretionary elements in the EI
Law and making others automatic; and streamlining decision-making
(para. 64);
(iv)   implementation *f a iiumber of measures to increase the effectiveness
of the export rediscounting facility (EDF): offering a lower
rediscount rate for exports destined for non-traditional markets
compared to those destined for regional markets; making the EDF
available to any exporter, whether manufacturer or selling agent;
and reducing the current interest rate margin between EDF credit
facilities and commercial bank interest rate to five percentage
points (para. 65) and holding it constant by changing the rediscount
rate in line with the commercial Bank lending rate.
88.      The proposed conditions for the release of the second tranche are:
(i)    finalization by the Government of its public expenditure program
based on discussions of the PER with the Bank (para. 54);
(ii)   reduction of maximum tariffs to 50% (para. 63); simplification of
tariff administration by introducing the Harmonized System
converting all rates to ad valorem; and only using multiples of 5%
in the new system (para. 59);
(iii)  provision by the Government to the Bank of a program specifying the
future steps and timing for the equal taxation of imports and
similar, domestically-produced luxury goods under the new tax regime
as mentioned above in para. 87, (ii) (para. 62);
(iv)   agreement on an action plan for the merger of the Free Zones
Corporation and Industrial Estates Corporation and the establishment
of an effective national investment and export promotion program,
based on a study undertaken by the Government (para. 70);
(v)    completion of an analysis of alternative forms of export credit and
agreement on the implementation of proposed recommendations based on
discussion of that analysis (para. 66); and



- 29 -
(vi)   official establishment of the apex agency and adoption of an action
plan in consultation with the Bank. (para. 76).
89.      Another important condition is the removal of import bans described
in Annex V, Category BI by January 1, 1990 and their replacement by tariffs,
except for six basic goods (para. 58).
E. Justification and Risks
90.         In the implementation of the adjustment program supported by the
proposed AL, Jordan faces two kinds of risks: those related to the internal
political economy of the adjustment program and those related to the external
environment. The Government responded promptly to the economic deterioration
in 1988. A number of policy measures were implemented and the Government
moved quickly to elicit support from the Fund and the Bank. The magnitude of
adjustment needed is large. A further reduction of the budget deficit, the
most difficult component of Jordan's adjustment program, will entail tough
and politically sensitive measures. The risk of policy slippage is therefore
high, particularly given the prevailing sensitive political and social
environment. Fortunately there are a number of factors limiting the extent
of this risk. There is a strong commitment to the program at the highest
levels in the Government. Furthermore, a large number of difficult and
unpopular measures (the exchange rate depreciation, the raising of petrol and
cereal prices; the removal of the investment licensing system, and the
elimination of QRs on competitive imports) have already been implemented.
Finally, the proposed operation includes a carefully designed program to
protect the poor during the adjustment period.
91.         In implementing the adjustment program, Jordan must contend with
an unpredictable and volatile regional political environment. While the
delinking with the West Bank was primarily a political move, it undoubtedly
led to capital flight. Fortunately, the situation proved to be temporary,
but continued adverse developments could lead to a shortfall in grants and
remittances, further endangering Jordan's fragile balance of payments.

PART IV. COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY AND BANK OPERATIONS
A. The Context of Bank Assistance: the Government's Own Development
Objectives
92.      The Government's objectives are reflected in its 1986-90 Five-Year
Plan which is designed to deal with the major medium-term challenges facing
Jordan. These include the need to accelerate growth and create employment
while sustaining viable budgetary and balance of payments positions.
Further, there is a need to deal with two long-term constraints recognized in
the Plan and deserving immediate attention: Jordan's rapidly growing
population and its increasing water scarcity. The Plan contains the key
elements of a strategy to deal with the problems stated above. It endorses
the continuation of an open and liberal trade environment and calls for a
conservative monetary policy, one designed to encourage domestic savings and
efficiency and a flexible interest rate poiicy. The Plan aims to restructure
the economy in favor of commodity producing sectors by developing labor
intensive small- and medium-scale industrial enterprises oriented towards
export. Other elements include the development of Jordan as a regional
center of banking, finance and technology; the promotion of tourism; and
continued efforts to strengthen Jordan's role as a supplier of skilled
manpower to the region.
93.      The assumptions behind the policy framework developed in the context
of the 1986-90 Five-Year Plan were not borne out. The economic situation
deteriorated rapidly during 1986-87, and a severe balance of payments crisis
developed in 1988. The Government's response has been broadly within the
framework provided by the Plan but has involved stronger measures, as
discussed before, to contain macroeconomic imbalances, to promote growth and
to help the poor.
B. Bank Strategy
94.      The Bank Group's strategy has been tailored to help the Government
respond to the fall in oil prices and the resulting slowdown in the regional
economies by (i) accelerating growth in the medium term. while maintaining a
viable budgetary and balance of payments position; (ii) minimizing the
emerging unemployment problem; and (iii) dealing with two critical long-term
constraints to future growth, a rapidly growing population and the increasing
scarcity of water. In view of the 1988 balance of payments crisis that
created the need to restructure the economy, the Bank is reorienting its
proposed lending program and refocussing its economic and sector work.
95.      Bank assistance to the Government's adjustment program is at the
center of our modified lending program. This program includes the proposed
ad-ustment loan to deepen reforms in industry trade and to help restructure
public expenditures. This operation, which is being undertaken in the
context of an agreed macroeconomic framework and in parallel with a Stand-By
Arrangement with the IMF, also includes measures to help the Government
protect the poor during the adjustment period.
96.      Subsequent adjustment operations could include possible support to
the agriculture sector (FY91). A recently completed sector report sets out a
policy framework and development strategy to increase agricultural efficiency
and accelerate growth. To help the Government diversify its export base an



- 31 -
Industrial Exports Project is envisaged as a follow-up to the adjustment
loan. This project would be aimed at helping the Government expand
traditional and non-traditional export-oriented industries. The Bank's
lending in the human resources area (para. 104 below) would be designed to
help the Government deal with the unemployment problem. Finally, by means of
the social impact component of the proposed Industry, Trade and Public
Expenditure Policy Adjustment Loan and the Social Development Project
(paras. 73-76), the Bank would help the Government establish and finance an
apex agency to improve the efficiency of existing non-governmental agencies.
97.      Bank Exposure and Creditworthiness.  The above lending strategy
would be implemented within the Bank's US$500 million, five-year lending
envelope for Jordan, which is expected to average US$100 million and three
projects a year and include other projects in the program (as discussed in
paras. 100 to 105 under sectoral composition of Bank lending). Based on this
program, Jordan's overall debt servicing capability and creditworthiness is
expected to improve quickly from a fragile initial position in 1989, as a
result of the strong adjustment program discussed in the section on
macroeconomic framework. In addition, Bank exposure would continue to be
moderate. At the end of 1988, the actuaL. Bank Group share in Jordan's total
external public debt was estimated at about 8.1%, and its share in debt
service was about 6.6X.  In 1989, the Bank Group share in debt outstanding
and disbursed and in debt service is expected to be about 7.0% and 11.17%,
respectively.
98.      The Bank's economic and sector work has been designed to provide the
necessary policy analysis to help the Government respond to a lower growth
and tighter balance of payments situation during the rest of the decade and
to support the Government's initiatives in the productive sectors, e.g.,
industry, trade and agriculture. The report on small- and medium-scale
industries sets out recommendations for improved protection and incentives
for investments and exports, and it also reviews several promising subsectors
for small- and medium-scale industrial development. In agriculture, the Bank
has reviewed the policy framework and development strategy for the sector and
made recommendations to increase agricultural growth and efficiency.
Finally, in the context of a country economic memorandum, the Bank has
reviewed major macroeconomic trends and policies in such areas as
competitiveness, unemployment and fiscal reform. The Bank's economic and
sector work has also examined employment issues and human resource
development, including health concerns. With regard to Jordan's long-term
constraints, the Bank's economic and sector work has paid particular
attention to the impact of Jordan's rapid population growth. The water
supply and sewerage sector has focussed on the other major long-term
constraint by helping the Government maximize scarce water resources,
strengthen sector institutions, and improve water resources management and
water systems operation and control.
99.      Our future economic work is designed to provide continued support
for Jordan's adjustment program and the intellectual underpinnings of a broad
policy dialogue. The public expenditure review (para. 54) would refine
existing analyses of trends in the overall resource balance and review the
different components of the public expenditure program in light of budget
constraints; a financial sector review would be designed to assist government
policy makers develop policies to improve the working of the financial sector
in Jordan.

C. Sectoral Composition of Bank Lending
100.     As of June 30, 1989, Jordan had received 29 Bank loans and 15 IDA
credits, totalling US$838 million (net of cancellations and terminations);
all the credits and the nine loans have been fully disbursed (Annex VII).
Project implementation and disbursement performance have been satisfactory.
Indeed, in recent years disbursements have amounted to more than 75% of
appraisal estimates, which is generally higher than the average for the EMENA
Region. The sectoral composition and some of the specifics of past lending,
as well as the design of major new lending operations, are discussed below.
101.     Agriculture: Jordan's agricultural potential is limited, given the
country's severe land and water constraints, and the role of the sector in
the economy has decreased over the past two decades. Nevertheless, there is
scope to improve the sector's efficiency in the medium term while helping the
Government adjust for the expected decline in long-term water availability.
Past Bank lending has been limited (only 2% of the Bank Group's program), as
the Government preferred that more concessionary sources of financing be used
for investments in this sector. The Bank is now discussing the feasibility
of a sector adjustment loan to address pressing issues of water productivity,
crop production/marketing, research/extension and credit institutions.
102.     Industry/Mining:  Some 97o of the Bank Group's lending has supported
industry and mining and has been designed to support high-priority projects
which utilize the country's limited resource base. Export-oriented projects
in the potash and phosphate mining subsectors are helping the Government
optimize existing investments and replace aging phosphate reserves with a
lower cost alternative. Given the importance of the industrial/mining sector
to overall Bank strategy, the Bank's lending program is expected to increase
substantially. Besides the proposed Industry, Trade, and Public Expenditure
Policy Adjustment Loan and the Industrial Exports Project already discussed
above, Bank lending would continue to assist Jordan's important
export-oriented, resource-based industries. The FY90 Integrated Phosphate
Project would help the Government implement an integrated development plan
for the subsector. A proposed Science and Technology Sector Investment Loan
would help the Government to (i) formulate and carry out a national science
and technology policy; and (ii) strengthen institutional support for
export oriented manufacturing based on science and technology development and
utilization.
103.     Infrastructure:  Past lending for transportation, energy/power and
water supply and sewerage (4X, 23% and 17%, respectively, of the Bank total)
has been designed to alleviate infrastructure con3traints and enhance
competitiveness in the productive sectors, as well as bring about
institutional improvements and increased efficiency in the sectors
themselves. Bank lending for water supply and sewerage has been designed to
help the Government (i) improve sanitary conditions; (ii) reduce groundwater
pollution and provide for effluent reuse; (iii) improve water resources
management and water systems operation and control; (iv) strengthen sector
institutions; and (v) develop appropriate cost recovery and other financial
policies. In line with the Government's changed investment priorities, less
emphasis will be placed on the development of new infrastructure, although
maintenance will continue to play a prominent role. Future lending for
transportation would include a possible second multimode transportation
project which, besides including institutional strengthening and a road
maintenance program, would meet the urgent transport requirements of the



- 33 -
important Shidiya phosphate mine. A possible Energy Sector Development
Project would build upon ongoing sector work and provide a vehicle for
addressing issues of planning, pricing, institutional reform and investment
priorities in the country's rapidly evolving energy sector.
104.     Human Resource Development:  The Bank has lent some 27% of its total
program for human resource development, which has included education and
vocational training, health services and population control. The Bank's
human resources strategy is designed to help the Government develop both the
quality of its labor supply to penetrate the higher-skill segment of the
external labor market and meet the labor demand in the domestic economy. The
recently approved Human Resources Development Sector Investment Project is
supporting a thorough reform of Jordan's education system to produce
graduates with a high quality general education and, hence, create a flexible
work force. The other leg of the human resources strategy would be supported
by the proposed Science and Technology Sector Project described above.
Recognizing that Jordan has limited natural resources but a relatively well
trained labor force, the Government plans to expand the country's existing
science and technology base as part of its efforts to develop a high quality,
high value-added export sector. Finally.,- our program includes further
assistance to the health sector, which would deal with issues such as the
quality of health care, and institutional and financial aspects of the
sector. Since high population growth is a key constraint for Jordan's future
economic development, Bank lending for health would also focus on this
crucial area.
105.     Municipal Development:- The Bank has been quite active in urban and
municipal development in Jordan--about 14% of past Bank lending has gone to
this sector. Projects have emphasized the development of more cost-effective
urban services and economic development patterns. They have also improved
shelter for low income groups under-served by existing programs and
strengthened the capabilities of local governments. For the future, a
proposed Municipal Finance Sector Loan would be based on ongoing sector work
that is examining the responsibilities of and services provided by
municipalities in Jordan.
106.     IFC Activities:  IFC has made ten investments in Jordan with gross
commitments totalling US$97 million. The largest investment has been in the
Jordan Fertilizer Industry Company (JFI); other investments have been made in
building materials and pharmaceutical companies, in the Jordan Securities
Corporation, and in a leasing company. IFC has also provided advice to the
Government on a number of issues, including the establishment of a stock
exchange/securities commission and most recently technical assistance, on the
feasibility of establishing a Jordan country fund as a vehicle for foreign
investment in Jordan.

The World Bank
1818 H Street, N.V.

U.S.A
Draft Letter Of Develovment Policy
Dear Mr. Conable.
1.    For the past several months the Government has been engaged in designing
and implementing a comprehensive reform program to recapture the growth momencum
of the economy while maintaining a viable budgetary and balance of payments
position. In this endeavour we have been working closely with the staff of your
institution as well as that of the International Monetary Fund(IMF).   I am
pleased to inform you that the IMF has supported our adjustment policies with
an eighteen month Stand-By arrangement, approved in July 1988.
2.    As spelled out below we fully intend to pursue and consolidate the
adjustment of our country's economy to enable it to grow in a sustained manner.
At the same time we are keen that the economically disadvantaged be protected
from the adverse impact of the adjustment policies. We trust that the World Bank
will support our adjustment program specifically by approving an Industry and
Trade Policy Adjustment Loan and by raising additional aid resources.
Measures Imnlemented To Date:
3.    After a period of rapid growth in the 1970s and early 1980s the Jordanian
economy has been suffering frum the effects of a fall in the price of oil and
the subsequent slowdown in the economies of its region.  Growth has stagnated
and the increasing disequilibrium in the central Government budget and the
balance of payments has resulted in a heavy external debt burden. Starting from
the middle of 1988 the Government's response to Jordan's economic difficulties
has accelerated, and a number of important policy measures have been implemented.
These could be classified into the following three areas: (i) exchange and
interest rate policies, (ii) budgetary policies and (iii) industry and trade
policies.
(i? Exchange and Interest Rate Policies:
4.    In response to the balance of payments difficulties being experienced by
the economy, in October 1988 the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) depreciated the
dinar from 0.33 JD per US dollar to about 0.50 JD per US dollar, corresponding



ANNEX III
Page 2 of 7
-2-
to a real effective devaluation of about 23% over one year. Since then, the JD
was further depreciated to 0.54 JD/US$ in February 1989 and by an additional 1'
percent to O.63JD/US$ in July 1989.   Beginning At xust 1989 the JD has been
floated except in a small number of transactions such as the purchase of
essential comodities. As a result of this move the price of the JD quoted by
the commercial banks depreciated to .80 JD/US$, before stabilizing at 0.69JD/US$.
5.     In late September 1988, the CBJ decontrolled interest rates on consumer
credit balances, call deposits and all types of time deposits. Lending rates
have been deregulated, and banks are free to set the cost of funds based on
market conditions.
(ii) Budgetarv Policies:
6.     The 1989 budget emphasized austerity.  On the revenue side, average income
taxes were raised, rental income deductions were reduced, interest on deposits
outside Jordan was made taxable, tax exemptions for education expenditures were
restricted, a 10% surcharge was placed on hotel bills,  the airport tax was
increased from 10 to 25 JD, and a 3% surcharge was placed on airline tickets.
On the expenditure side, all purchases of furniture and vehicles were halted
regardless of the source of financing.   For any purchase above JD 50,000,
approval from the Council of Ministers is required. All expenditures on new
infrastructure and service projects were halted.   While these measures were
substantial, a mid-year review indicated that further measures were needed to
restrict the budget deficit to about 20% of GDP (excluding grants). Accordingly,
further measures were implemented including: an increase in petroleum prices;
an increase in taxes on cigarettes and tobacco; an increase in taxes on steel
bars and soft drinks; and a reduction in subsidies on wheat, barley and milk
among other items.
(iii) Industry and Trade:
7.    In August 1988, the Government announced a number of measures to improve
the operating environment  for  industry.    These  included an abolition of
investment licensing, elimination of import bans on competitive imports and a
considerable narrowing of exemptions from paying import duties. The Government
also launched a program for strengthening institutional support for investment
and exports including issuing a guarantee that all requests for investment
incentives would be processed in less than a month and allowing the trading
companies all the incentives and duty exemptions granted to manufacturers.
Medium-Term AdJustment Program:
8.    The Government believes that a precondition for stimulating sustainable
growth in the Jordanian economy is the implementation of a macroeconomic
stabilization program, at the heart of which is the reduction of the budget
deficit.  This should be complemented by a set of policies and institutional
improvements for increasing the international competitiveness of the goods and
services produced in Jordan. A key policy in this.regard is the maintenance of
a competitive exchange rate as is the case now for all but a handful of strategic
commodities.   This must be supported by a reform of the trade regime and



ANNEX III
Page 3 of 7
-3-
institutional improvements in support of exports and investment. Such a package
of measures would stimulate potential sources of growth in the Jordanian economy
such as small and medium scale industries, high value agricultural products and
skill intensive commercial services such as computer programming. The measures
implemented so far have largely adhered to the principles stated above and are
already beginning to show some positive impact on exports.   The Government
however recognizes that the momentum of the reform must be sustained in order
to achieve an acceleration in growth while maintaining a sustainable budgetary
and balance of payments situation. Accordingly the Government has designed a
comprehensive medium-term adjustment program with the assistance from the Bank
and the IMF. The program involves measures to:
. Ensure a competitive and stable macroeconomic
environment.
Other policies to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of
industry and trade.
. Protect the poor during the adjustment period.
Macroeconomic Policies
9.    Maintenance of a competitive and stable macroeconomic environment over
the medium term is critical for the success of the reform program.   The
Government's efforts in this area have been supported by an IMF standby
arrangement which would establish a balance of payments and fiscal framework
necessary for improved macroeconomic performance.
10.   A reduction in the budget deficit (excluding grants) from  23.7% of GDP
in 1988 to 9% of GDP by 1993 is at the heart of the Government's program of
macroeconomic stabilization. This would involve measures to reduce expenditures
as well as enhance revenues.  Jordan's tax system suffers from the narrowness
of its tax base, heavy dependence on imports taxes, specificity of most rates,
absence of a generalized consumption tax, and a wide gap between effective and
statutory tax rates due to liberal import duty exemptions. The Government is,
therefore, formulating a comprehensive tax reform, with the objective of raising
the tax effort from 32% of GDP in 1988 to 36X of GDP in 1993. An IMF mission
has already completed background work in this area on the basis of which specific
proposals will be developed.
11.   The Government proposes to complement the measures on the revenue side
with measures to reduce the total expenditures from 53.7% of GDP in 1988 to 46%
of GDP in 1993. The key elements of the Governemnt's strategy include (i)
reduction of the wage bill, subsidies and defense expenditure as a proportion
of GDP, (ii) the rationalization of the public investment program and (iii) the
protection of critical expenditures on health, educatiLn and social services.
The Government will appreciate if the Bank could assist in carrying out a review
of the public expenditures, the terms of reference of which have been drawn up
in consultation with the Bank staff. We hope that such a review could identify
ways to reduce the public expenditures as a percentage of GDP without unduly
limiting the prospects for growth or equity.
12.   Achieving a sustainable balance of payments is a major objective of the



ANNEX III
Page 4 of 7
-4-
Government's adjustment program. A key policy in this regard is the exchange
rate.. In this area the Government has demonstrated its flexibility by the sharp
depreciations of the Dinar in 1988 and 1989 when the currency came under market
pressure.  For the future, the Government is committed to a flexible unitary
exchange rate policy reflecting market forces. Within this framework, in view
of the tight demand management policies put in place, the expected foreign
exchange inflows and debt relief the Government believes that exchange rate
stability could be maintained in the near future. Hownver, the Government is
prepared to respond to any unexpected pressures that may develop by adopting
appropriate remedial policies, in consultation with the staff of the IMF.  In
parallel, the Government is actively engaged in an effort to mobilize external
resources in support of the adjustment program.   The Government has already
rescheduled its official external debt with the members of the Paris and the
London Clubs.
Othe:g Policies to ImDrove the Comgetitiveness and Efficiency of Industry and
Trade:
13.     The policies to improve the competitiveness of industry and trade-the
two critical sources of growth in the Jordanian economy, being implemented by
the Government could be classified as follows:
. Trade Reform-
Reform of the Encouragement of Investment (EI) Law
. Institutional Reforms in Support of Industry
Trade Reform:
14.      A reform of the trade regime is needed to translate the gains in
competitiveness resulting from the improved macro framework into increased output
by simplifying the trading procedures and by reducing the wide variation in
protection resulting from the wide variation in tariff rates. The Government
intends to harmonize the tariff system by the introduction of the CCCN
classification system, a shift from specific to ad valorem rates, and those rates
becomlng multiples of 5%.   The Government will eliminate the quantitative
restrictions (QRs) on 11 of the 16 items on which they currently exist, thereby
reducing the percentage of domestic manufacturing protected by QRs from 40% in
early 1988 to less than 7% in 1990.   The Government will complement these
measures by reducing the range between the maximum and minimum tariffs to 45
percentage points over the next two years.   This process of reform will be
sustained by further narrowing the difference over the next two to three years,
at a pace and to a level that will be determined by the revenue and resource
allocation impact of the initial adjustment.
s 15.     In designing the tariff reform, given the constraints of revenue and
domestic taxing capacity, three groups of commodities will require special
treatment. First, tariffs on a short list of goods, primarily mass consumption
items amounting to 6.5% of dutiable imports, would continue to remain zero in
the face of the overall tariff reform. Second, for a list of luxury goods for
which there are no similar domestically produced goods, the tariffs will also
remain unchanged in the face of an overall tariff reform. Third, for a list of
luxury goods for which there are simlar domestically produced goods, the total
tariff would be split into a basic tariff and a consumption tax.  The tariff



ANNEX III
Page 5 of 7
-5-
would be subject to the same maximum as other goods.  The consumption tax on
impQrts would be collected at customs while a tax on a similar domestically
produced item would be introduced gradually, as Jordan's domestic taxing capacity
develops. Before the release of the second tranche, future steps and timing
towards the equal taxation of imports and domestically produced items would be
agreed upon with the Bank. After developing these lists in consultation with
your staff, the Government proposes to compress the tariff range as shown in
Table 1 below:
Table 
Jordan--Trade Refom Characteristics
Indicator        Present  situation          1st Tr.       2nd Tr.
Minimum Tariff             0                    5X           5Z
Maximum Tariff            318X                  60X          50X
Reform of the EI (Encouragement of Investment) Law:
16.   The Government is planning to offer the incentives made available by the
EI law by a less discretionary, more transparent and administratively simple
system. To this end, a revised points system for the approval process has been
designed and a number of discretionary elements in awarding benefits will be
replaced by automatic mechanisms.
Institutional Reforms In Support Of Industry:
17.   The Government intends to implement a series of institutional reforms in
support of industry and trade.   The net impact of this reform would be to
facilitate investment and exports.
18.   Meraer of Industrial Estates Cornoration (IEC) and Free Zones Corporation
(FZCL: The Government has decided to merge IEC and FZC. In consultation with



ANNEX III
Page 6 of 7
e6-
the Bank the Government has finalized the terms of reference of a study that will
assist the Government in defining an action program to support the merger and
to determine the role and strategy of the institution created after the merger.
The Government is also proposing to address the question of defining a broader
investment and export promotion strategy in the same study.
19.     Eiiort Finance:  The Government is planning to improve the institutional
arrangements for export finance in the short term by increasing the effectiveness
of the present Export Rediscount Facility. The measures include reducing the
discount rate subsidy, making the rediscount rate sensitive to the market rate
of interest, and introducing an interest rate differential in the favour of non-
traditional markets in order to promote export diversification.  For the long
term the Government is examining alternative forms of providing export finauce,
including the feasibility of creating a separate export credit insurance and
guarantee organization.   Draft terms of reference of a study to define these
alternatives have been drawn up in consultation with the Bank. staff.   The
Government expects to complete the study and reach agreement on the
implementation of the proposed recommendations based on the discussion of the
study with the Bank by the second tranche.
20.     Standards:  With the assistance of the EEC and Germany, the Government
is currently engaged in designing and implementing appropriate industrial
standards, the absence of which was identified as a serious bottleneck for
exports. A report prepared in 1988 with German assistance recommended a number
of changes in the legislative and administrative structure for setting and
implementing industrial standards. In May 1989 a temporary law on standards and
specifications was promulgated incorporating several of the changes proposed in
the GTZ study. The Government is seeking the Bank's assistance to review this
effort and suggest future direction.
Protectinu The Poor Durin4z the Adjustment:
21.     The Government is seeking the Bank's assistance in identifying a program
of actions to mitigate the impact of adjustment on the economically disadvantaged
in Jordan. This work, which is still ongoing, suggests that a fund to support
micro-level production activities targeted to the poorest in the country offers
the best instrument to deal with this issue.   In addition the Government is
working on the following areas: defining a scheme for improving the targeting
of food subsidies to the poor, ensuring that critical social expenditures are
protected in the process of reducing the budget deficit, and improving the
working of the Non-Goverrmental organizations in support of the poor.
22.     In summary the Government of Jordan is taking substantive and difficult
measures to tackle the economic problems facing the country.
Macroeconomic Prospects And Financing Requirements:
23.     On the basis of a successful implementation of the adjustment program
described above, real GDP growth which was negative in 1988, is expected to
accelerate to about 4Z p.a. by 1992 resulting in a modest increase in per capita
consw ption.  Projections for the balance of payments consistent with the growth



ANNEX III
Page 7 of 7
-7.
scenario show that the current account deficit (including grants) could be
gradually reduced to zero by 1992 and thereafter be in surplus. The financing
requirements of the economy to achieve a sustainable balance of payments would
nevertheless be substantial. The gross resources required to finance the current
account deficits before grants, debt service payments on old and new debt, and
a modest build up of external reserves to one and a half months of imports is
estimated at about US$4.3 billion, or US$1.43 billion p.a. over the three years
1989-91. Of this amount, US$1.4 billion could be obtained from regular borrowing
and about US$ 1.0 billion from regular grants, which would leave a gap of about
1.9 billion that the Government proposes to raise from debt rescheduling,
multilateral institutions and concessional resources from traditional bilateral
donors as Zollows. First, the Government has finalized the arrangements for a
rescheduling of its official external debt from the Paris Club for a portion of
the payments falling due till the end of 1990 and is concluding a similar
arrangement with the London Club. Although debt relief from all sources, over
the next three years, could amount to as much as US$2 billion, the Governmenc
is aware of the high cost of relying predominantly on debt rescheduling to
finance the emerging balance of payments gaps.   Therefore,  the Government's
financing plan aims to rely on a reasonable level of debt rescheduling and raises
the remaining amount from a mix of Multilateral and bilateral concessional
sources. Second, the standby arrangement concluded with the IMF together with
the compensatory financing facility, amounts to about US$100 million over a one
and a half year period. We hope that the Bank's proposed AL would contribute
US$150 million. Given the magnitude of exceptional financing required and the
potential availability of assistance from other donors, we hope that it would
be possible to obtain a second Bank policy based quick-disbursing operation (of
$50 million). Assuming this second Bank loan and a repetition of the IMF standby
arrangement in tt.e third year, the total resources made available co Jordan bv
the Bank and the IMF would amount to about US$340 million. This would leave the
Government with about US$0.7 billion or about US$230 million p.a. to be raised
from its traditional donors at concessional terms in addition to the regular
grants of about US$330 million p.a., which we believe is a reasonable assumption.
