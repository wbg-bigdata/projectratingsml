INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO SYRIA FOR A
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed de-
velopment credit to Syria for the equivalent of $15 million on standard IDA
terms to help finance a water supply project. The equivalent of US$ 14.2
million out of the proceeds of the credit would be relent to Etablissement
Public des Eaux de Figeh (EPEF) for 25 years, including 5 years of grace,
with interest at 6 percent per annum to help finance the expansion of water
supply in Damascus. The balance of $0.8 million would be retained by the
Government and help finance pollution control and sewerage studies.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Syria"
was distributed in February 1972 to the Executive Directors. An economic mis-
sion visited Syria in October-November 1972 and its report has been distributed
separately. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        Since the attainment of independence in 1946, Syria has had numerous
changes in regime which resulted in a shift of power from groups of landowners,
traders and industrialists to a rising class of technicians, officers, and
civil servants, and a shift of the economy from a laissez faire system
to a largely publicly owned and regulated one. The Baath Socialist Party --
the ruling party since 1963 -- has provided substantial continuity of emphasis
on economic and social development policies, which have prevailed in spite
of Government changes and external tensions. During the 1960's an agrarian
reform was completed, with redistribution of land to large numbers of formerly
landless peasants.   In November 1970 President Assad came to power.    His
regime has been characterized by a balance of firmness, political moderation
and economic pragmatism; search for a better defined role for the private
sector in the centrally regulated economy; and improved economic relations
with Western countries. Relaxation of administrative controls, decentralization
of administrative responsibilities, import liberalization measures and guar-
antees to those repatriating funds have resulted in a marked improvement
in the domestic political and business climate. In March 1973, a permanent
constitution was approved by referendum, which provides for general elections
of the legislature within 90 days and election of the President by national
referendum for a seven-year term.
4.        Syria's rapidly growing population requires accelerated develop-
ment of the country's land and water resources. Only about one third of the
country's 8.8 million ha of cultivable land is planted in any one year and
about one fourth of 2 million ha of irrigable land is irrigated. Apart from



- 2 -
some oil and low grade phosphates, no other significant and exploitable
mineral resources are known. Proven oil reserves are of the order of 300
million tons, not including recently discovered fields.
5.        In the last decade, diversification of production and rapid
growth were achieved under fairly stable prices. GDP increased in 1960-72
by about 7 percent per year in real terms, compared to 3.4 percent during
1953-60.  The most dynamic sectors were manufacturing, transport, communica-
tions and services during the whole decade, agriculture in the early 1960's,
.nd oil production and oil transit during the late 1960's. Industry has also
grown rapidly, its value added increasing by about 10 percent per year and
its share of GDP rising from 17 percent in 1966 to 19 percent in 1971. Agri-
culture, mainly rain-fed cotton and cereals, remains however the most impor-
tant sector of the economy. Although its share of GDP declined from 25 per-
cent in 1966 to 20 percent in 1971, it still employs nearly two-thirds of the
labor force and accounts for two-thirds of exports. Wide fluctuations in
agricultural production primarily caused by variations in rainfall are
a major unsettling factor in growth; agricultural production stagnated
in the second half of the nineteen-sixties and had a 26 percent increase
in 1972. A substantial increase in oil transit rates in 1971, new factories
entering into production in 1972, and an improved business climate, also
contributed to a GDP increase of about 13 percent annually in real terms
in 1971 and 1972.
6.        Apart from mil_.ary expenditures, which are related to the condi-
tions i-n the region, resource allocation has been consistent with the priority
needs of the economy, and a large public investment effort has been a main
factor of dynamism. Total investment grew by about 9 percent per year over
the last decade, rising to about 13 percent per year in the second half, with
public investment accelerating to 17.5 percent and compensating for the slow-
down of private investment after nationalizations. In 1971, private invest-
ment jumped by 30 percent as a result of import liberalization measures and
total investment increased by 19 percent, reaching 17 percent of GDP. Meas-
ures have been taken to strengthen the country's infrastructure, expand its
industrial basis, and develop its limited petroleum and mineral resources.
Agriculture, irrigation and land reclamation received about 18 percent of
public investment in 1960-1970, and the construction of a dam at Tabqa on
the Euphrates set the basis for lessening the dependence of agriculture on
weather conditions through irrigation.
7.        In spite of continued austerity of non-military current public
expend-ture, public revenues were insufficient to meet both the increasing
defense burden after 1967 and the requirements of a large investment program.
Taxes remained low, averaging about 10.2 percent of GDP in 1966-71. Constant
public salaries since the mid-sixties and redistribution of wealth have
lowered the taxable base. In 1969, the Government took several measures to
improve tax assessment and collection and increased somewhat the rates for
profit taxes.    There is still some scope for structural improvements in the



-3-
tax system.   Savings of public enterprises rose substantially, especially
in oil and banking, partly offsetting the increase in the current budget
deficit, and financed an increasing part of public investment. However, with
modest gross national savings and with low net external financing, domestic
borrowing from the banking system, mainly from the Central Bank, increased
considerably, to finance the current budget deficit as well as part of invest-
ments. Extensive and effective price controls, a preference for currency
hoarding since 1967, increasing monetization of the economy and some capital
flight, a fast growth of commodity imports and running down of foreign assets
contained the inflationary effects of high liquidity in the economy. The
retail price index increased by only 3 percent per year in the nineteen six-
tieEs. In 1970, the Government took measures to encourage private savings and
limit credit expansion, including higher interest on deposits, saving certif-
icate issues and restrictions on credit overdrafts. As a result, the growth
rate of money supply decelerated to 6.4 percent in 1971 (compared to 15 per-
cent per year during 1966-70) and demand deposits increased by 19 percent.
8.        After a period of small overall surpluses, the balance of payments
has been in deficit and net foreign assets declined every year since 1968.
In 1966-1971, imports grew at an average annual rate of about 9 percent and
exports by about 3.5 percent. In spite of rapidly growing exports of petro-
leum, the trade deficit increased due to the stagnation of other exports and
to a rapid increase of food imports, both due to particularly adverse weather
conditions, and to increase of import requirements of capital and intermedi-
ate goods. The increasing trade deficits were only partly offset by rising
receipts from services, mainly oil pipeline dues representing 28 percent of
total export earnings in 1971. Recent liberalization policies and devalua-
tion of the Syrian pound have resulted in capital repatriation and a better
investment climate in the private sector. In 1971, the Government liberal-
ized imports requirements, essentially by permitting their financing by use
of Syrian foreign exchange holdings abroad. Most external transactions were
shifted from the official rate (LS 3.82=US$ 1) to a free market rate (LS
4.32=US$ 1) and the earlier parity with the dollar was maintained after the
currency realignments of December 1971.1/ In 1972, exports increased sub-
stantially (particularly wheat, petroleum and textiles) due to a record
harvest and the 1971 currency realignment. There was also a marked increase
in official grants from Arab countries ($42 million during January-September
1972 compared with $21 million in 1971), and a jump in net private capital
inflow (from $1 million in 1970 to $75 million in 1971 and $23 million in
January-September 1972). However, because of fast growing imports due to
liberalization and delayed payments of oil transit dues after the 1972 national-
ization of the Iraq Petroleum Co. (IPC) pipeline, net reserves deteriorated.
1/   Since February 1973, the free rate has been LS4.05 = US$1.



- 4 -
9.        Employment problems remain serious, as growth of direct employment
opportunities has been limited by the low labor requirements of the oil sec-
tor and other industries and the long gestation of most public investments.
Emplcyment in industry stagnated between 1966 and 1971 and employment in Gov-
ernment and services increased by only 2 percent per year, compared with a
3.3 percent increase of population and 3 percent of active population. Emi-
gration, particularly to Lebanon, provided a limited relief and agriculture
-bsorbed most of the increase of active population. Although official esti-
mates indicate open unemployment at only 4.3 percent, a decrease of productivity
in agriculture during the last decade points to increzasing under-employment.
10.       Good export and production prospects indicate that it is possible
for Syria to achieve the Third Plan targets of 8.2 percent GDP growth per
year in 1971-75, and a total investment (LS 8 billion) double the amount of
the Second Plan. In the longer term, the Government's continued emphasis on
investment should make it possible to sustain a 7 percent annual growth.
Prospects for continuing fast growth in oil, manufacturing and electricity
are favorable and growth in private investment may well continue. The recent
liberalization measures and the ambitious investment program are likely to
result in 9 percent import growth per year. Following the devaluation of
the Syrian pound in 1971 and the agreement Syria has reached with Iraq in
1973 on increased oil transit dues, exports of goods and non-factor services
can be expected to grow e  over 10 percent per year.  Surpluses in public
enterprises can be expected at least to double over the Second Plan period,
mainly due to rising oil production, higher transit dues and the growing
contribution of banking. With the recent improvements in taxation and the
expected fast growth of production and exports, tax revenues should rise
above the low 1971 levels. Therefore, a substantial improvement of the sav-
ings rate is feasible, barring major crises.
11.       Syria, however, will require more external aid, technical assist-
ance and guidance on institution building than it can obtain from its present
sources, if it is to reach the above targets.  The bulk of Syria's external
borrowing was ccncentrated in 1965-67, with gross offi cial capital inflows
averaging some $55 millior. per year since 1965 and a peak of almost $80 mil-
lion in 1967. Reported external debt outstanding and disbursed increased
from an estimated $100 million in 1963 to about $230 million at the end of
1971. Debt including undisbursed has risen from about: $258 million at the
end of 1970 to $325 million at the end of 1971, of which debt outstanding to
Governments amounted to $273 million, mainly to USSR, East Germany, Kuwait,
Czechoslovakia and Saudi Arabia. Suppliers' credits dropped from 16.6 percent
of total debt outstanding (including undisbursed) in 1970 to 13.6 percent in
1971. IDA disbursements amounted to $7.2 million at the end of January,
19/3.  Commitments incceased substantially in 1971, mainly from East Germany,
Kitqait, USSR and Japan. Tne average borrowing terms have improved from 9.7
years maturity, 2.8 years grace and 3.3. percent interest in 1967 to 14.3
years maturity, 4.1 years grace and 3.1 percent interest in 1971. Owing to
the rel atively short maturity periods on earlier debts and concentration



- 5 -
of borrowing in the mid-sixties, debt repayments, fluctuating between $25
million in 1967 and $51 million in 1969, offset a large part of the gross
inflow, and over half of outstanding debt is to be repaid during 1972-76.
Debt service payments, excluding any possible military debts, about which
information is not available, amounted in 1971 to $49 million, or 13.3 per-
cent of exports of goods and services, and remained at about the same level
in 1972 but are expected to fall to around 10 percent by 1973.
12.       Requirements of gross official external assistance are expected to
rise from about $50 million in 1971 to about $80 million in 1975 and average
about $100 million a year thereafter. Existing sources of external assist-
ance are expected to continue lending at present levels, and the balance
will have to be found from multilateral and new bilateral sources. The debt
repayment burden appears manageable assuming that the recently improved
terms obtained from existing bilateral sources of lending continue to be
available and that substantal assistance will be on concessional terms, such
as Syria now receives from East Germany, China and IDA.
13.       Syria's recent growth with substantial price stability, improved
export prospects and generally favorable outlook for further growth, adequate
public investment planning and recent improvement in economic management with
the devaluation and liberalization measures, indicate satisfactory performance.
The projected debt service burden permits some additional borrowing on conven-
tional terms. However, production and foreign exchange earnings are still
dependent on widely fluctuating weather conditions, and prospects of receiDts
for oil transit after 1975, when the existing agreement with Iraq expires,
are unknown at this stage. Substantial inflows of private capital and Arab
grants are a recent phenomenon, and thei;- future level may fall with changing
political conditions. Given these uncertainties, a per capita income of only
about $270, growing underemployment problems and negative net foreign exchange
reserves, Syria should seek to obtain a substantial share of its external
capital on concessionary terms and qualifies for IDA assistance, as well as
for some Bank lending.
14.       Following Iraq's nationalization of the facilities of the Iraq
Petroleum Company (IPC), Syria nationalized the section of the pipeline
running through its territory, in June 1972, with a provision for compensa-
tion. However, no negotiations took place on this matter, pending the set-
tlement of the compensation issue between Iraq and the IPC. In January, 1973,
Syria and Iraq reached an agreement on new transit rates. On February 28,
1973, Iraq and IPC signed an agreement on compensation for the nationaliza-
tion of IPC facilities, and it should now be possible for compensation nego-
tiations between Syria and IPC to take place. We will follow developments
on this matter closely.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
15.       Syria has to date received two IDA credits, both for highways,
totalling $22.3 million. The first operation, amounting to $8.5 million,
w~-3 In 1963, and the second, amounting to $13.8 million, was signed in April
;972. The first highway project is about to be completed satisfactorily, al-
rhough it had a slow start. The credit for the second highways project
became effective in February 1973. Though Syria is a member of the corpo-
raticn, IFC has made no investments there in the past. Annex II contains
a summary statement of IDA credits as of April 30, 1973, and notes on the
execution of on-going projects.
16.       The Government's increased emphasis on sound economic management
provides the Bank Group with an appropriate setting to make a meaningful
contribution to economic development. Syria's relatively developed admin-
istrative structure, adequate public investment planning and increasing
interest in cooperating with the Bank Group should make it possible for it to
absorb larger amounts of IDA and Bank financing than in the past. In line
with the needs of the economy and the Third Plan investment strategy, the
Bank Group will focus on: (i) irrigation and soil improvement in the
Euphrates basin, to increase agricultural employment,production and exports
while reducing food imports, and the dependency on weather fluctuations; (ii)
water supply, sewerage, transportation and power projects of high priority;
and (iii) rural development and family planning schemes.
17.       Project preparation is well advanced for a power loan in FY74
following the proposed water supply credit. The Bank Group is participating
in the study of a first irrigation project in the Euphrates Valley and in
preparing urgently needed projects for drainage in the lower Euphrates,
which are likely to result in lending operations in FY 74 and FY 75,
respectively. The development of the Euphrates Valley over a forty-year
period is expected to quadruple the country's installed power capacity,
reduce the dependence of the economy on rainfall fluctuations by doubling
the area of the country's irrigated land, reduce underemployment and permit
the urgent resettlement of people displaced by the building of the Tabqa
Dam. In view of tne simultaneous construction of two large dams on the
Euphrates in Turkey and Syria, technical discussions have been taking place
in the last few months between Turkey, Syria and Iraq to regulate the flows
of the Euphrates during the filling period of the two dams.
PART III - WIATER SUPPLY AND POLLUTION CONTROL IN SYRIA
13.       About one-third of Syria's 6.2 million population live in the
four largest cities of Damascus, Aleppo, Homs and Hama, around which most
manufacturinc, plants are located. M-igration from rural areas, comparatively



- 7 -
higher fertility rates and lower mortality rates than in the rest of the
country have resulted in growth of urban population ranging between 4 and
6 per cent annually, substantially higher than the national average of about
3.3 percent. Damascus, the country's capital and one of the oldest contin-
uously inhabited cities in the world, has one million people and is experienc-
ing a population growth of 5 percent a year. While Aleppo, Homs and Hama
have recently embarked on expansion schemes to meet the growing demand for
water, Damascus has had no major water supply expansion over the last forty
years.
19.       Since the time of ancient Rome, Damascus has used an abundant sup-
ply of high quality water at low cost from a spring in the neighboring hills
(Figeh Springs).  The city's potable water system has a comparatively large
number        of individual water connections and serves 80 percent of the
population. The rest is served by public taps. Per capita consumption, at
about 110 litres per day, is not high. Demand for water is expected to grow
at about 6 percent per year until 1985 and 5 percent thereafter, mostly as
a result of population growth in the city and a modest increase of per capita
consumption. In recent years, the canacity of the transmission system has
been barely sufficient to meet peak demand, and dry season shortages and
restrictions were experienced in 1971 and 1972. In addition, the yield of
the Figeh Spring has fallen to alarmingly low levels during drought years.
Water shortages will become more serious, unless production and transmission
facilities are expanded.
20.       Urbanization and industrial activity have created serious pollution
problems affecting populated areas of Syria, and gastrointestinal diseases
related to polluted water resources and lack of sanitation are considered
the most prevalent causes of debility and morbidity. Fairly adequate sewer
networks exist in the major cities of Aleppo, Homs and Hama, but the centuries-
old system of Damascus is inadequate. None of these cities nor any large
industries have sewage treatment plants, and their discharge into rivers,
with relatively small dry weather flow, causes pollution of water used for
irrigation, industries and towns. Pollution problems are especially serious
in the Orontes river basin, where almost one million people live and where
the industrial towns of Homs and Hama are located, and in the basin of the
Barada River, which receives sewage from Damascus.
21.       The Government has become increasingly aware of these problems
and, in 1972, made a start towards creating a Pollution Control Department.
The Department has prepared draft legislation for regulating discharge
of industrial waste and is considering measures to control waste discharges,
however, progress is hampered by shortage of financial resources and scarce
engineering skills.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
22.       A report entitled "Syria:   Appraisal of the Damascus Water Supply
Project" (No. 106a - SYR dated May 14, 1973) is being distributed separately.
The main features of the project are summarized in Annex III.
23.       During the nineteen sixties Etablissement Public des Eax de Figeh
(EPEF) became increasingly aware that the demand for water was approaching
zhe capacity of the Damascus system, and commissioned studies for its ex-
pansion. SOGREAH--Societe Grenobloise d'Etudes et de Applications Hydrau-
liques (France)--prepared a study on the hydrology of the spring and its
possible development, as well as feasibility studies for source development,
transmission facilities and storage. SEURECA--Societe d'Etudes pour l'Urbanisme,
l'Equipement et les Canalisations (France)--prepared a master plan, based
on an urban plan for 1984, for the expansion of the distribution network
and a feasibility study for distribution works in 1973-77.
24.       In 1971 the Government requested assistance from IDA for a project
based on these studies to expand the water supply svstem of Damascus. A sec-
tor reconnaissance mission visited Syria in Au-gust 1971, and preappraisal
missions in March and September 1972. In the meantime, the Government also
requested assistance in financing studies on wastewater disposal for Damascus,
on sewage treatment plants for Homs and Hama, and on pollution control in the
basins of the Orontes and Barada rivers.
25.       The proposed project was aDpraised in November-December 1972. N
Negotiations for the proposed credit were held in Washington in April 1973.
The Syrian Government was represented by Mr. Abdel-Razzak Abdel-Baki,
Minister of Rural and MunicioalJ Affairs, and Mr. Mohamed Al Amir, Vice
Minister. EPEF was represented by 'Mr. Rida Mourtada, General Manager.
26.       The project, whose construction is scheduled from 1973 through
mid-1977, would (i) increase the quantitv of water available from the Figeh
Spring through construction of an underground cut-off wall and pumping;
(ii) increase transmission capacity by construction of a 15-km tunnel from
the spring to the city; (iii) expand the storage and distribution system and
replace the older parts of the distribution network; (iv) improve leak detec-
tion and metering; (v) train EPEF staff in management and engineering; and
(vi) finance water pollution and sewerage studies which include preliminary
engineering for treatment facilities in the Homs/Hama area, and engineering
for the first stage of construction of sewerage system and treatment facil-
ities at Damascus, as parts of master plans for pollution control in the
basins of the Orontes and Barada rivers. Appropriate safeguards are included
to protect the ground water source of Damascus from poLlution.



-9-
Project Maaagement
27.       EPEF was created as a governmental utility in 1958.    Although
administratively attached to the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs,
EPEF operates autonomously in day to day operations, has its own assets, and
prepares its budget. The General Manager, appointed by the Government, is
responsible for all managerial and administrative functions. Although it is
reasonably well managed, EPEF has not in the past felt pressed to husband the
supply of water, which was abundant compared to demand. As a result, flow
measurement and recording have been perfunctory, numerous leaking mains are
suspected, and meters are in disrepair.
28.       EPEF realizes that these matters now require improvement, and has
undertaken to (i) submit and carry out a program acceptable to IDA to reduce
water losses (ii) introduce immediate improvements in its accounting and
audit, and commission a study for the improvement of its organization and
operating procedures, in line with the expected expansion of its operations;
(iii) create a project unit to supervise implementation of the proposed pro-
gram; and (iv) engage consultants acceptable to IDA to assist in contract
administration and construction supervision for the source development, tunnel,
terminal reservoirs and telecommunications, and to finalize designs, prepare
tender documents and supervise construction for the distribution system.
29.       Concerning the water pollution studies, the Government will create
in the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs a special unit which would
work closely with the consultants in carrying out the studies to be financed
under the audit and maintain liaison with municipalities and industries in
the river basins. It might eventually be responsible for implementing the
recommendations resulting from the studies. The establishment of this unit
is a condition for disbursement of the portion of the proposed credit that
is to be used for pollution control studies.
Project Cost and Financial Results
30.       Total project cost is estimated at USS32.6 million equivalent,
including US$1.0 million equivalent for the pollution control studies. The
proposed credit for $15 million would finance most of the estimated foreign
exchange cost of $17.8 million. The rest of the foreign exchange cost is
represented by equipment previously purchased by EPEF without international
competitive bidding. The amount of the credit relent by the Government to
EPEF will finance about 45 percent of the cost of the water supply component.
About 30 percent of this cost would be financed from internally generated
funds of EPEF and 25 percent from a contribution from the Government's cen-
tral investment pool embodying the accumulated cash surpluses of state
agencies, toward which in past years EPEF has contributed a substantial part
of the funds now needed.



- 10 -
31.       EPEF's financial position is sound and is expected to remain so.
The rate of return on average net fixed assets in operation has increased
from 8.4 percent in 1969 to 12.7 percent in 1972.    The large, "lumpy" invest-
ments now required will, however, greatly inflate EPEF's presently small rate
base as well as increase    operating expenses considerably.   Annual deprecia-
tion, for example, will triple over the next ten years. If tariffs remained
unzhanged, operating expenses would overtake annual revenues by 1976. EPEF
has agreed to modify tariffs as necessarv, in order to: (i) ensure that
ordinary annual revenues cover operating expenses (including depreciation
and interest) at all times; and (ii) produce a rate of return gradually
rising during the years after project completion to reach 7-1/2 % in 1982
and thereafter.   These provisions are adequate to assure EPEF's financial
viability. They would on the basis of present financial projections require
a rate increase from LS 0.20/m3 to LS 0.27/r3 in 1975, and a further increase
to LS 0.30/m3 in 1982.
32.       EPEF's debt service coverage is projected to be satisfactory, at
2.1 when amortization of the Government loan begins in 1978 and 2.7 by 1982.
EPEF has agreed not to undertake any medium- or long-term debt without the
Bank's prior approval, unless EPEF's net revenues cover debt service at
least 1.5 times.
Procurement
33.       Goods financed by the proposed credit would be procured through in-
ternational competitive bidding, except for tools and equipment costing less
than $5,000 and limited in total to $50,000. It is expected that virtually
all large civil works contracts -- including most of those for the installa-
tion of distribution pipes -- and equipment supply contracts will be awarded
to foreign firms.
Disbursement
34.       Disbursement would be made against:
(i) The CIF cost of imported equipment and
the ex-factory cost of locally produced
equipment.
(ii)  The foreign exchange costs of consultants and train-
ing; and
(iii) Fifty-five percent of all civil works contracts,
representing the estimated foreign exchange
component.
It is proposed that up to $200,000 be reimbursed retroactively to the
EPEF from the proposed credit for expenditures on engineering consulting
services incurred from July 31, 1972 in preparing technical and feasibility
stud1c- for the water supply project. The estimated schedule of disburse-
ments is shown in Annex IIT.



Economic Justification
35.       The project is technically sound and economically justified.    The
proposed water supply component represents the least-cost solution. The rate
of return based on incremental water sales is 12 percent, but understates
the economic return on the project, because benefits to public health and
better fire protection are not fully reflected in the price paid by the con-
sumer. Without the project, EPEF would have to refuse to make new connections
and water shortages would increase. The proposed pollution control studies
are a necessary prerequisite to the reduction of health hazards and environ-
mental nuisances in densely populated areas, with a positive impact on reduc-
tion of morbidity and increase in work productivity.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
36.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Syrian Arab
Republic and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Asso-
ciation and the Etablissement Public des Eaux de Figeh, the Recommendation
of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Development
Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. Rati-
fication of the Development Credit Agreement by the legislature is required
under the laws of the Syrian Arab Republic and, owing to the lengthy legis-
lative process involved, a period of six months has been allowed after the
date of signature for the fulfillment of the conditions of effectiveness.
Otherwise, the draft agreements conform to the usual patterns for water
supply projects.
37.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
38.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

Credit No. 46 - First Highway Project
This project includes improvements of the 530 km Damascus-Homs-Hama-
Aleppo-Raqqa highway linking the capital city with the country's major
productive centers. Construction started only in 1968 because of inade-
quate engineering studies and the need for a complete redesign of the
highway. Works are now well underway and are expected to be completed
by late 1973. The original closing date (December 31, 1968) has been
postponed to December 31,1973.
Credit No. 298 - Second Highway Project
This project includes improvement and construction of 153 km of roads,
linking Damascus with the Lebanese and Jordanian borders. The credit
became effective in February 1973, after the establishment of a central
maintenance department in the Ministry of Communications. Project
preparation progressed as scheduled and construction is expected to
start by late 1973 as envisaged during appraisal.

PRCCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS:
All items financed by the Association, except for
minor items of equipment, will be subject to inter-
national competitive bidding. Up to $200,000 for
foreign exchange expenditures on consultants' ser-
vices for the Damascus water supply project, in-
curred since July 31, 1972 would be reimbursed
retroactively to EPEF.
CONSULTANTS:
Damascus Water Supply
- Societe Grenobloise d'Etudes et d'Applications
Hydrauliques. SOGREAK (France): feasibility
studies final designs and tender documents for
source development, tunnel between the source
and Damascus, and terminal reservoirs.
- Societe d'Etudes pour l'Urbanisme, l'Equipement
et les Canalisations. SEURECA (France): final
designs and tender documents for distribution
network.
- Contracts to be awarded: (i) design and con-
struction supervision of minor reservoirs;
(ii) supervision of construction for source
improvement, tunne' and terminal reservoirs;
(-ii) supervision of construction of distribu-
tion network.

Water Pollution Control Studies
Contract to be awarded: study of measures to
control pollution in the Barada and Orontes
rivers; engineering for treatment facilities in
the Homs/Hama area; and engineering for the
first stage of development of the sewerage
system and treatment facilities of Damascus.
ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN:
About 12 percent with respect to the water supply
component; this rate understates the economic return
on the project because benefits to public health are
not fully reflected in the price assumed for the
calculation.
