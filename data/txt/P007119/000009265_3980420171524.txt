MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR
FOR A FOURTH SMALL SCALE ENTERPRISE PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum, and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Ecuador for US$50.0 million equivalent, is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be repaid over 17 years, including 5 years of grace, at the
a        Bank's standard variable interest rate and charges.  It would help finance a Fourth
Small Scale Enterprise Project.
Background
2.       Macro Performance.  Ecuador has enjoyed average GDP growth of about 5? a
year over the past twenty-five years, a record exceeded only by Brazil among the
Latin American countries. This growth, more dyi.amic in the 1970s than ir. the 1980s,
was mainly associated with the rapid development of the petroleum sector during
1973-82. High oil revenues and external credit financed both the expansion of
domestic demand for manufactures and production capacity, while the expansion of the
Andean market provided the basis for growth in industrial exports from less than
US$50 million in 1975 to US$250 million in 1981. As a result, the manufacturing
sector increased its share of GDP from 16.22 in 1972 to a peak of 19.42 in 1983.
The expansion, however, could not be sustained when oil revenues dwindled, external
credit dried up and various other shocks (the 1983 floods, the 1987 earthquake, the
collapse of the Andean Market) hit the economy. As a result, GDP grew by an average
of only 0.6? p.a. from 1982-87.
3.       Ecuador's economic performance has been hampered by the country's misguided
development strategy during the 1973-82 oil boom phase. Oil export revenues and
large scale external borrowing led to an appreciation of the real exchange rate,
which undermined the development of agriculture and export-oriented manufacturing.
The stock of external debt expanded without a commensurate strengthening of
Ecuador's non-oil export capacity. Similarly, public sector finances were allowed
to become excessively dependent on petroleum revenues while tax concessions and
subsidies expanded. Under these conditions, adjuastment to reduced external credit
and oil price shocks of the 1980s has been particularly difficult.
4.       Sector Characteristics.  During the 1982-87 period, the average growth rate
of manufacturing output dropped to 0.3? p.a. compared to 8.42 p.a. over the
preceding five years. Consequently, Ecuador's level of industrialization fell from
a 19.3? share of GDP in 1983 to 16.8? in 1988. The share of small scale enterprises
(SSEs) in total industry value added increased, however, from about 36? in 1980 to
42? in 1987. SSEs' production is largely concentrated in labor-intensive goods,
which comprise much of the country's comparative advantage. SSEs, defined as
establishments with less than 50 employees, account for 742 of manufacturing
employment. Available statistics indicate that SSEs create employment at only a
sixth to a quarter of the costs in large firms of similar industries. Thus, because
the cost of SSE employment creation is low, SSEs have generated virtually all of the
additional manufacturing employment during the eighties. SSEs' larger share in
employment than in value added is due to the SSEs larger average labor intensity.
5.       Limited funding, coupled with t'.- high cost of credit delivery, high
perceived risk, inadequate collateral ana accounting information are the main
constraints in lendirg to SSEs; this situation has been aggravated by an ownership
structure of the financial sector which has shown a close relationship between
banks, development finance companies (DFCs), and large industrial/commercial groups.



- 2 -
The SSE share of the banking credit system has been declining from 7.72 in 1981 to
4.52 in 1987. The other sources of financing include the entrepreneurs' own
resources plus loans from suppliers and street-lenders. All these constraints have
resulted in a higher cost of credit for SSEs than for large industr;.
6.       Policy Framework. The industrial policy framework has been characterized by
a high level of import protection and by policies that subsidize the cost of capital
and raise the cost of labor. The tariff code and the industrial promotion law
(which grants tariff exemptions from import duties for industrial inputs and capital
goods, and gives income tax deductions for investment purposes), have resulted in
major deviations in the rates of effective protection among sectors. Subsidized
interest rates significantly lowered the cost of capital to business enterprises
and, coupled with high taxation of dixridends, encouraged these enterprises to become
highly leveraged. Labor costs have been raised by legislation that sets minimum
wages above market clearing levels ana that increases the cost of labor mobility,
thus exacerbating the factor price distortions implicit in financial and trade
policies.
7.       Ecuador traditionally has pursued strong protectionist policies.  However,
the various market distortions have a much greater impact on the larger industries
operating in the formal sector than on most SSEs which benefit less from protection,
are subject to a less restrictive labor market, and have less access to subsidized
credit. An Industrial Sector Study, currently under preparation by the Bank, has
concluded that key sectors with a high percentage of SSEs (food processing, textile
and leather products, wood and furniture, metal products) have relatively low
average rates of effective protection (between 202 and 302). The analysis also
indicates that SSEs do not obtain major benefits from the industrial promotion law
that exempts imports from tariffs because the majority of SSEs use few if any
imported inputs.  SSEs avoid labor stability regulations through temporary contracts
or outright neglect that the Government is unable to counteract and which the
employee is often unwilling to denounce. Minimum wages are lower for SSEs than for
large industry.
8.       The purformance of the financial sector in Ecuador from the point of view
of resource allocation, institutional strength, and mobilization of domestic
resources for long-term lending reveals several weaknesses. These date back to the
1970s, when the financial system grew rapidly, mainly because of the availability of
external financing which domestic banks intermediated charging high margins for
providing exchange rate guarantees for foreign loans to the private sector.
Additionally, negative real intereet rates charged to final borrowers and attractive
margins and commissions provided to intermediaries stimulated lending growth. This
environment provided little incentive for financial institutions to mobilize
domestic resources on their own, who became increasingly dependent on the Central
Bank (BCE) credits and foreign borrowings for resources. The ensuing structural
weaknesses of the financial system were compounded by easy granting of bank
licenses, which in turn led to the establishment of many small, undercapitalized
banks.
9.       In the mid-1980s, the Government initiated a far-reaching program of
financial reform to spur domestic resource mobilization and to strengthen financial
institutions by allowing them to intermediate a larger volume of financial resources
efficiently. Among the most important measures taken were: (i) creating a
Certificate of Deposit with a freely determined interest rate; (ii) introducing
adjustable rates on loans with resources from the BCE or internatio-al institutions;
(iii) subsequent freeing of the interest rate on all deposit instruments, and
freeing of interest rates on all lending instruments except BCE lines of credit and
adjustable rate lending; and (iv) increasing the interest rates on BCZ credit to
align them more closely with market interest rates.



10.      During the past two years. the Bank has supported a strengthening of the
banking system and a rationalization of the interest rate regime through the
Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (2897-EC, FSAL). The Bank approved the
US$100 million FSAL in December 1987, released the first tranche (US$50 million) in
January 1988, and the second tranche in (US$50 million) in September 1989. The
present Administration has demonstrated a strong commitment to the objectives of the
FSAL program, which is focussing on: (i) strengthening financial institutions (Fls)
through improvements in the regulatory framework, upgrading the performance of the
Superintendency of Banxs (EB) and gradually restoring the capital adequacy of these
institutions; (ii) more efficient intermediation by restraining the growth of BCE
rediscounts to FIs and by linking the interest rate on BCE funded credit to rv.rket-
determined rates; and (iii) development of the capital market by improving t :
conditions for variable interest rate lending, for the establishment of sho _-term
and long-term market-determined interest rates, and for promoting the issuirig of
equity finance by companies.
11.      Issues and Reform.  Facing an expected fiscal deficit of 102 of GDP in 1988
and inflation running at an annual rate of 80 to 902, the Government (which took
office in August 1988) acted quickly to introduce fiscal measures and restrict
monetary growth. These policy measures, aided by a rise in international oil prices
in late 1988, allowed the Government to cut the 1988 fiscal deficit to about 5.1Z of
GDP, about half of what had been projected at mid-year. Further measures on
interest rates and exchange rates have been taken during 1989; gasoline prices have
been raised monthly during the year. Indications are that the stabilization is
succeeding. Preliminary figures for 1989 show that the consolidated non-financial
public sector deficit was contained to about 32 of GDP in 1989. As a result of
stabilization, GDP growth slowed down to between 0 and 12 and inflation was reduced
to 541 in 1989 from 892 in 1988. Ot'ner performance criteria under the IMF standby
were also met in December.  For l99u, the targets are a fiscal deficit equivalent to
about 22 of GDP, growth of 3 to 3.52 of GDP p.a., and inflation at 40? p.a. or less.
12.      Ecuador's medium-term strategy calls for a more diversified structure of
production and exports to protect the country against fluctuations in the
international prices of oil and other traded commodities, and to establish a base
for the post-oil era. At the core of Ecuador's structural problems is the need to
shift resources from the production of non-tradeables, including public sector
activities, into the efficient production of exports and competitive import
substitutes. A step in this direction has already been taken with the substantial
increase in the real exchange rate of the last two years. By late 1989, the gap
between the official and free market rates had closed to within 5 percent. If
Ecuador's potential in the medium-term is to be achieved, a strong and permanent
trade reform, including basic industrial and labor policy changes, would be needed.
*     13.       To this end, the Government, after having addressed first fiscal and
financial issues, is now implementing an income tax reform (which would align the
cost of equity capital and the cost of debt capital) and preparing a trade and
industrial policy strategy. The Bank is assisting the Government in the design of
these reforms. The forthcoming Industrial Sector Study will provide the basis for
the policy dialogue.
14.      The changes in the interest rate regime, which the Government had
introduced in the context of the second tranche release of the PSAL, have resulted
in positive deposit and lending rates. The interest rates for certificates of
deposit (CD) have been positive since April 1989, when interest rate reforms were
introduced which increased the flexibility of the system and made it more responsive
to market forces. Real interest rates for CDs are 4? at present. Also, ceilings on
internationally funded loans to large scale industry have been removed--a measure



that goes beyond the requirements of the FSAL program. Furthermore, the Government
has committed itself in a letter to the Bank to move the various sector specific
interest rates, in uniform steps every six months, to the level of the market based
commercial bank lending rate within less thaa three years. These adjustments are
the result of a dialogue on financial matters between the Government of Ecuador and
the Bank which started in the early 1980s. The Government's commitment to raise the
interest rates for small scale industrial and agricultural lending to levels
determined by the market goes significantly beyond the understanding reached under
the FSAL.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
15.      The Bank is responding with this loan to the priority the Government is
attaching to the development of the SSE sector because of its contribution to the
medium-term strategy of diversification into non-traditional tradeable goods,
efficient industrial development and socio-economic objectives: entrepreneurial
development, upgrading of labor skills, and employment creation. Lending to SSEs
supports enterpri3es that absorb the less skilled segments of the manufacturing
labor force, a key source of the country's comparative advantage. The loan has been
designed, in the context of a broader adjustment program and complementary to the
interest rate progress, to further the productivity and competitiveness of small
industrial firms. It would build upon the success of three previous projects in
maintaining a Bank association with Ecuador's smll scale enterprise sector through
the Development Fund for SSEs and Artisans (FOPINAR) which has been ranked among the
very best apex institutions of its kind by a recent Bank study of seventy small and
medium industry (SMI) projects.  An analysis of SSE financing suggests that without
FOPINAR, SSEs' access to term financing would have been virtually non-existent.
SSEs have performed very well under three previous Bank loans. Lending has growr.
rapidly in FOPINAR's eight years of operation, reaching nearly 5,000 SSE
beneficiaries and maintaining a high repayment record, with only 3? in arrears at
the end of 1988, compare, with 10? for large industry. Continued Bank involvement
through this project, buttressed by a novel technical assistance program, would help
to provide the support the small entrepreneurs need to diversify and expand
production, while addressing the main constraints on the growth and development of
SSEs, namely a lack of term finance and the paucity of appropriate technical
assistance. The loan would have a catalytic function in demonstrating to the banking
sector and its clientele the profitability of lending to SSEs at market-determined
interest rates.
Project Objectives
16.      The proposed operation would help enhance the contribution of SSEs to
industrial development. Specifically, the loan would help modernize and expand
production by: (a) facilitating the access of SSEs to formal credit; (b) promoting
lending to SSEs by participating financial intermediaries (PFIs); (c) providing more
focused and integrated technical snd managerial assistance support to increase the
productivity of eligible SSEs and reinforce coordination among organizations that
provide technical and financial assistance to the small firms; and (d) further
strengthening the management and technical skills of participating financial
institutions that provide credit to SSEs. Efforts will also be made to promete
actions toward improving the environment and enhancing the role of women in business
activities. Environmental safeguards will be built into FOPINAR's Statement of
Policy and Operating Procedures. Specifically, approval of subprojects related to
wood processing with potentially damaging effects from deforestation would require a
satisfactory environmental assessment. With regard to the rcle of women, the Bank
will, during execution of the project, pay particular attention to identifying
barriers to women's opportunities to participate more fully in SSE activities, and
to developing action plans to improve their access to credit and to technical
assistance.



Prolect Description
17.      To achiLeve these objectives, the proposed project would comprise: (a) a
credit component of US$50 million to finance SSE fixed assets. permanent working
capital (both associated and free-standing), and subproject related technical and
managerial expenditures; and (b) a technical assistance program of US$1.6 million
equivalent, of which US$1 million would be financed by the Corporacion Financiera
Nacional (CFN) and by a grant from the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). and
US$600,000 by local counterpart funds.  Enterprises involved in manufacturing
(including agro-industry), industry-related services, fisheries, and tourism would
be eligible. The total project cost, estimated at about US$83 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$50 million (602), would be financed as
follows: SSEs 201, the PFIs 8?, Bank resources 602, and CFN--through FOPINAR--the
remaining 122. The Bank and CFN resources (FOPINAR loan) should finance a maximum
of 72? of total project cost. Of the FOPINAR loan, 85? would be financed by the
Bank and 15? by CFN. An amount not exceeding US$5 million (10? of the loan) would
be available retroactively for financing expenditures made after December 13, 1989.
A breakdown of costs ard the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank
Group Operations in Ecuador are shown in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 7691-EC, dated January 9, is also attached.
Onlending and Disbursement Procedures
18.      The Republic of Ecuador, using the Central Bai.k (BCE) as its agent, would
onlend the proposed loan resources in Sucres to CFN, on the same maturity as the
Bank's loan (17 year repayment period, including 5 years of grace). CFN, using
FOPINAR as a second-tier mechanism, would rediscount all subloans made by financial
intermediaries to eligible SSEs. The onlending rate has been set initially at the
90-day certificate of deposit rate. Beginning on July 1, 1990, it would be adjusted
in uniform steps every six months to reach the market-determined commercial bank
lending rate by June 30, 1992. The onlending rate would include a maximum spread of
6? p.a., for financial intermediaries, depending on the size of the subloans, and a
spread of 2.5?, for FOPINAR to cover its operating costs and part of the technical
assistance activities. CFN would pay in turn a service fee of .125? p.a. to BCE.
The spread is to remain fixed during the life of the subloan.
19.      While the onlending rate t, final beneficiaries of the loan would be
positive, there would initially be a difference of 11 percentage points compared to
the commercial bank lending rate for large industries. This difference will be
reduced in line with the schedule of adjustments towards the market-determined
commercial bank lending rate; it will be eliminated at the latest by June 30, 1992
and considerably earlier if the present trend of declining inflation, and consequent
decline in nominal interest rates, continue.1 The Central Bank would cover the
exchange risk; this is justified because the small scale entrepreneurs do not have
revenues in foreign exchange and because of the movement towards market oriented
interest rates under the loan in the context of a freely floating exchange rate.
1/ Lending at the CD rate will, under current circumstances, imply a
subsidy by the Central Bank if measured against its cost of funding and
the intermediation spreads. This subsidy cannot be calculated with
precision in view of uncertainties about future exchange rate
adjustments (inflationary expectations apparently are below present
rates of inflation). The subsidy will eventually be eliminated in line
with the adjustments towards a market-determined lending role.



-6-
Agreed Actions
20.      Agreement has been reached on the following: (a) beginning on July 1, 1990,
the onlending rate on all long term loans to small scale industry iv to be adjusted
in uniform steps every six months to reach the market-determined con.nercial bank
lending rate by June 30, 1992; (b) CFN is to oversee the implementation, by all
financial intermediaries, of an interest capitalization scheme acceptable to the
Bank that would be offered as an option to final beneficiaries. CFN's Board of
Directors will have approved the scheme by loan effectiveness. It will be
implemented by July 1, 1990; and (c) appropriate procedures and administrative
structures are to be established and a core team to be employed by loan
effectiveness for the strengthening of FOPINAR's Technical Cooperation Committee to
ensure efficient execution of the Technical Assistance Program.
Benefits
21.      The proposed project would help integrate the SSEs more effectively into
industrial development by increasing their productivity and competitiveness. The
coordinated package of financing and technical assistance would stimulate production
and provide the needed term financing. On the basis of experience under the
previous three SSE loans, the proposed project is expected to finance some 4,500
investment subprojects, costing about 11$83 million and generating about 14,500 new
jobs. It is also ;expected that about 402 of subprojects financed would be in the
industrial centers of Pichincha and Guayas, which contain a high concentration of
the urban poor in Ecuador. Better services to SSEs, as well as efficient subloan
and subproject implementation, would result from the institutional support provided
to FOPINAR. More than 1,000 enterprises would receive direct tecthnical and
managerial assistance. A further 1,500 firms would benefit from training and
extension activities.
Risks
22.      One main risk can be identified: that high inflation and continued
recession, coupled with the introduction of market-determined interest rates on
subloans, could reduce loan demand and cause a slower pace of commitments and
disbursements under the proposed operation than in the previous three SSE loans.
The Goverment's comriitment to stabilizing the economy and its success in reducing
the fiscal deficit and inflation augurs favorably for a resumption of economic
growth with relative price stability in the medium-term. The expected strengthening
of the economy combined with the favorable outlook for SSE development should
sustain strong demand for financing under the loan.
Recommendaticn
23.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would ccmply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.
