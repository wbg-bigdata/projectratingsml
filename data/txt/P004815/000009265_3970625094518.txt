Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:               Vanuatu
Amount:                 SDR 1.9 million (US$2.0 million) equivalent.
Terms:                  Standard IDA terms
Colmnders:              The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a loan
of SDR 2.8 million (US$3.0 million) equivalent from
its Special Fund Resources, and a technical assistance
grant of US$270,000 for the project. Under the
cofinancing arrangement with IDA, the ADB will take
the lead in subproject administration, monitoring and
supervision.
Project Description:    (i) Objectives:  The project would consist of a group
of high-priority public sector investment subprojects
in the transport and education sectors. The transport
sector subprojects, including rehabilitation and
upgrading of roads and construction of wharves in the
northern part of the country, would provide support to
agriculture and strengthen the economic base of the
country. Investments in the education sector would
help reconstruct nine cyclone-damaged primary schools.
(ii) Subprojects: The following subprojects have been
identified and appraised in general terms by a joint
ADB/IDA mission: (1) rehabilitation and upgrading of
roads on the islands of Vanuatu Lava, Ep, Poama, Maewo
and Ambae; (2) construction of six wharves along the
coasts of the islands where the road rehabilitation/
upgrading work will take place; (3) detailed engineer-
ing for Santo port development which handles a large
volume of the export and import trade for northern
Vanuatu; and (4) reconstruction of nine primary
schools in the islands of Espiritu Santo, Ambae, Maewo
and Pentecost which suffered heavy cyclone damage in
January 1985. While the suitability and viability of
these subprojects have been established during the
joint appraisal, each subproject would still be sub-
ject to more detailed analysis by the consultants (to
be hired with the ADB grant), using economic evalua-
tion guidelines/criteria which have been agreed among
the Covernment, ADB and IDA. IDA will be cofinancing
with the ADB the subprojects under (1) and (2) above.

Benefits and Risks:      (i) Benefits:  Rehabilitation and upgrading of roads
and construction of wharves will facilitate trade and
increase production and exports in the outer islands
where most of Vanuatu's agricultural exports origi-
nate. Reconstruction of the cyclone-damaged primary
schools will restore the physical facilities necessary
for effectiveness of the education programs in the
areas affected.
(ii) Risks:  The major risk associated with the
project is possible delays in the implementation of
subprojects. To minimize this risk, the Government
will engage consultants to support its Public Works
Department during the project execution.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO TEE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
FOR A PROPOSED MULTIPROJECT CREDIT
TO VANUATU
1.        I submit the following Report and Recommendation for a proposed
multiproject credit on standard IDA terms to the Republic of Vanuatu for the
equivalent of SDR 1.9 million (US$2.0 million) equivalent to help finance a
project consisting of several subprojects (multiproject). The project will be
cofinanced with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as the lead institution.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
The Setting
2.        The latest economic report, "Vanuatu: Selected Development Issues"
(No. 4489-VA), was issued on July 29, 1983. Specific economic issues have
also been examined in two subsequent sector reports: "Vanuatu: Education and
Training Sector Report" (No. 5217-VAN, dated February 1985); and "Vanuatu:
Issues and Options in the Energy Sector" (No. 5577-VA dated June 1985), a
report of the joint UNDP/World Bank Energy Sector Assessment Program. Basic
country data are presented in Annex 1.
3.        The Republic of Vanuatu has a population of 127,000.  The country
has a total land area of about 12,000 km which is spread over some 80 islands
and 850 km in the southwest Pacific Ocean (see map). From 1906 to November
1979, Vanuatu was an Anglo-French Condominium, an arrangement involving three
separate administrations: British, French and a joint administration. Since
the country became independent in July 1980, the Government has been promoting
the unification of the tripartite administration it inherited. Although
"localization" is a long-term objective, the country will continue to rely
heavily on expatriate staff for some time to come.
4.        The economy of Vanuatu is dualistic.  The modern sector, in which
expatriates have a substantial role, is highly service-oriented, consisting of
government services, tourism, and the Finance Center (banking and tax haven
activities), together with some small industries and plantation agriculture.
The traditional sector encompasses 80% of the population, but just 20-30X of
CDP. While the traditional sector is predominantly composed of subsistence
farmers, there is a growing segment of smallholders engaged in the production
of cash crops. Wide disparities exist between the income levels in the modern
sector and the traditional sector.
Recent Developments
5.        After an initial downturn experienced in 1980, resulting from
economic and political disturbances associated with the independence, economic
growth in Vanuatu has been steady. Rough estimates indicate that real GDP
rose by 2Z p.a. in 1981 and 1982, by 3Z in 1983, and by 5% in 1984. The



-2-
improved performance in 1983 and 1984 was largely the result of favorable
market conditions for the country's primary export commodity, copra.
Inflation, which was 27Z in 1981, had moderated to about 5% by 1984.
6.        In spite of this good recent record of economic growth, however, a
number of major constraints are likely to impede further development in the
near future. The economy is heavily dependent up3n revenues from two major
activities, copra exports and tourism, both susceptible to frequent
oscillations. Problems of land tenure and ownership that were inherited at
independence remain largely r solved.  There are severe shortages of skilled
and professional ni-Vanuatu.-  Insufficient infrastructure outside of the two
main urban areas, Port Vila and Santo, prevents the rapid assimilation of the
rural sector into the modern economy; and high transport costs, which impede
both domestic and international trade, add a further handicap to
development. While a number of these constraints are being addressed in the
First National Development Plan (FNDP) (1982-86), progress is unavoidably
slow.
7.        The economy's vulnerability was demonstrated in 1985, with a
reversal of the growth pattern established over the past few years. This
occurred for reasons outside the control of the Government:  two cyclones
severely damaged the export crops;- world prices for copra have plummeted
since mid-1984; and, the downturn in the Australian economy, coupled with the
political turbulence in New Caledonia, have depressed tourism receipts. As a
result of these developments, real GDP is estimated to have declined by 3Z in
1985, with inflation slowing to between 3% and 4Z.
8.        Merchandise exports amounted to an estimated total of US$17 million
in 1985, slightly above the annual average in 1971-83 of US$15 million.
However, this is a substantial decline from the US$32 million recorded in
1984. This volatility arises from copra exports, which constitute about 50Z
of total exports. Merchandise imports in 1985 are estimated to have remained
at their 1984 level of US$51 million; this is 19% higher than the annual
average of 1981-83. Food, beverages, and consumer goods account for over one
half of imports. This composition of imports reflects the importance of
tourism to the economy (as most of the food items consumed by tourists are
imported) and the consumption patterns of the large expatriate community.
9.        The deficit on the service account is expected to worsen to about
US$3 million in 1985, from an average of US$1 million during 1981-84, as a
result of the decline in tourism receipts (para. 7). In 1982 and 1983, the
current account deficit averaged about US$23 million or 28% of GDP. The
deficit declined to only US$13 million (14Z of GDP) in 1984. However, with
lower export earnings and depressed service receipts, the current account
deficit is estimated to have increased in 1985 above the 1982-83 average.
Throughout the period 1982-84, official grants have more than offset the
I/   ni-Vanuatu are the indigenous people of Vanuatu.
2/   In January 1985, two devastating cyclones hit the northern regions of
Vanuatu and caused damage estimated at US$5-6 million.



-3-
shortfalls in the current account and, therefore, the stock of public debt has
remained small. In fact, the debt service ratio averaged only 4Z during the
early eighties and fell to below 2Z in 1984.
Foreign Aid
10.       The operations of the public sector are characterized by a heavy,
though decreasing, dependence on foreign grants from France, the United
Kingdom and Australia. During the period 1981-83, the overall budget of the
Central Government was in surplus, but total expenditures remained high
relative to domestic revenues. In response to a 34Z decline in foreign grants
over this period, the Government instituted a number of new tax measures to
strengthen the domestic revenue base and to lessen the dependence on foreign
assistance. As a result of this effort, the percentage of total expenditures
financed by domestic revenues was raised from 29Z in 1981 to 42% in 1983.
Since Vanuatu's tax system is heavily dependent upon taxes on international
trade, i.e., commodity exports and imports of luxury items, total revenues and
grants increased by 28X in 1984. With total expenditures rising only 12%, the
overall surplus burgeoned to VT 453 million (US$4.6 million). The 1985
performance is likely to show a slight deficit on the overall budget balance,
because of increased expenditures on cyclone reconstruction and reduced tax
revenues from copra exports and tourism.
11.       The Government also depends heavily upon foreign aid for its
development expenditures, including a sizeable component of grant aid. France
and the United Kingdom have been the major bilateral donors for budgetary
support, as well as for development projects and other non-project
assistance. Australia's development assistance to Vanuatu has increased in
recent years. New Zealand and Japan have also provided financial aid for
projects and technical assistance.   Among multilateral aid agencies, ADB,
UNDP and EEC have been active in Vanuatu. ADB lent for two agricultural
extension and training projects and made several technical assistance grants
1982 through 1984.
Future Prospects
12.       Currently Vanuatu's external debt is negligible, but in the medium
term it may have to rely on overseas borrowing to maintain the tempo of
economic activity and bridge the gap created by a shortfall in foreign
exchange availability. Export earnings have been eroded by the decline in
copra prices and in tourist arrivals. The former are unlikely to recover for
sometime and the outlook for the latter remains uncertain. To avoid
persistent trade and current account deficits will require budgetary
discipline, especially control over the outlay on wages and salaries. The
recent devaluation of the vatu and the opening of the new hotel will
favourably influence the tourist trade, but a sustained effort will be
necessary to preserve Vanuatu competitiveness in the tourist market. Longer
term development will be closely linked to an expansion of the pool of skilled
ni-Vanuatu who can gradually displace expatriates. The establishment of
commercial centers to draw a larger segment of the rural population into the
monetized economy and increase the utilization of the country's natural
resources would also contribute substantially towards economic progress.



-4-
PART II - THE BANK CROUP OPERATIONS
Past IDA Lending
13.       Vanuatu joined the Bank Group in 1981.  So far, IDA has extended
only one credit of US$2.0 million, approved in August 1983, for an
agricultural extension and training project (Credit 1407-VA). The project,
which was cofinanced with the ADB in the lead role, was designed to strengthen
the Government's agricultural support services and to contribute to increased
cash incomes and improved living standards for the smallholder farmers. The
credit disbursements initially fell behind the appraisal schedule, mainly due
to delays in the Government's recruitment of key project personnel and to a
lack of experience with preparation of IDA wichdrawal applications. However,
disbursement performance is expected to improve shortly, as the Ltaff
recruitment has now been completed and arrangements have been made to expedite
preparation of withdrawal applications.
IDA Lending Objectives
14.       IDA assistance in Vanuatu, consistent with the Government's own
development strategy, focusses on the agricultural sector and related
infrastructure needs, and improved education and training facilities. In
agriculture, the Government aims at strengthening and diversifying the
economic base through development of cash crops and improved farming skills,
with increased agricultural production and incomes by the smallholders. To
complement these investments, provision has to be made to improve the basic
transport system, including roads and maritime infrastructure. In addition,
in view of the shortage of skilled mAnpower, there is need for investment in
the education sector, to improve the skills of the work force, as well as to
integrate the French and English medium curricula and adapt the system to the
socio-economic needs of the country. IDA staff are assisting the Government
in the development of an education sector investment program, with a view to
findncing items within the agreed program and assisting the Government with
donor coordination activities in the sector.   Within these general lending
objectives, the proposed project would help finance construction of wharfs and
landing stages and rehabilitate/upgrade access roads to the ports in the outer
islands, to link the agricultural areas to marketing and distribution centers,
and to facilitate export of agricultural products. The proposed project would
also help finance the reconstruction of some cyclone-damaged schools in
northern regions of the country. Wherever feasible and desired by the
Government as well as the ADB, co-financing of projects with the ADB in the
lead is undertaken, as is the case with this project.
Constraints for IDA Lending
15.       IDA lending operations in Vanuatu are constrained by the small size
of the projects and the limited absorbtive capacity, which make the use of
standard Bank Group project evaluation and monitoring procedures very costly
in terms of manpower deployment and financial costs. Similar constraints are
also encountered by the ADB which shares IDA's lending objectives related to a



-5-
broadening of the productive base of the Vanuatu economy through assistance to
the agricultural sector, upgrading the related infrastructure, and human
resource development. In addition, the Government has also explained its
limited capacity in dealing with missions from donors, and has expressed a
preference to handle a few well coordinated operations. To deal with the
constraints in lending, ADB has developed a "multiproject" approach for use in
small Pacific Islands where the scale of individual investment projects is
often too small for sectoral lending operations. Under the multiproject
approach, small projects are grouped together as a cost-effective method of
addressing the multisectoral developmental needs of such countries. This
approach has been adopted in the case of a multiproject in Western Samoa which
IDA and ADB are jointly financing and would also be followed in the case of
the proposed lending in Vanuatu (para. 27). As in the case of the Western
Samoa multiproject and the previous IDA lending operation in Vanuatu, IDA and
ADB would collaborate in processing and subsequent monitoring of execution of
the jointly-financed projects, with ADB in the lead. In the case of the
proposed lending to Vanuatu, the project components (the subprojects) have
been selected and appraised in general terms during a joint ADB and IDA
appraisal mission. Thereafter, the ADB is taking the lead in providing
technical assistance and support to the implementing agency and in detailed
evaluation and subsequent supervision of the subprojects. With its regional
office in Port Vila, ADB is well placed to handle the tasks in these areas.
PART III - THE SECTORS
A.   The Transport Sector
16.       Being an archipelagic nation, Vanuatu is critically dependent on
maritime transport to sustain and develop its domestic and international
trades, as an essential prerequisite for the country's economic growth. The
inter-island system of maritime transport has to be complemented by land
transport networks on the individual islands, and appropriate model interfaces
have to be developed in the form of ports and wharves. Effective transport
arrangements are also a basic requirement for improving the provision of
social services throughout the country. Finally, to increase the
attractiveness of Vanuatu for international tourism, reliability of transport
networks and quality of transport services in selected regions of the country
have to be improved.
17.       Present Infrastructure.  Among Vanuatu's 80 islands, only three have
relatively well-established transport infrastructure, i.e. Efate, Espiritu
Santo, and Tanna.  The councry's entire road system comprises some 1,300 km,
of which nearly 50% are concentrated on these three islands. Only about 1OZ
of all roads are paved, exclusively in and around the major urban areas. Road
densities on all other islands are very low; many parts of these islands have
no road infrastructure at all. Almost 70% of the road network consists of
fair weather earth tracks with poor geometrics, which are only passable by
four-wheel drive vehicles. As a consequence, road transport in Vanuatu is
very costly. In 1984, there were about 6,400 vehicles in the country, over
80% of which were operating on the islands of Efate and Espiritu Santo.



- 6 -        j
18.       Vanuatu has two international ports, Port Vila on the island of
Efate, and Santo on Espiritu Santo. Cargo throughputs in each of these two
ports was about 79,000 metric tons in 1984. Since Independence, the average
annual growth rate of import and export cargoes through these ports was
17.5Z. The inter-island fleet currently consists of 41 ships, with a total
capacity of about 3,600 gross registered tons (CRT). Most capacity (75X) is
owned and operated by the private sector. Government owned ships are used
mainly for administrative and health services, and to provide services to the
small and remote islands. Most inter-island ships are overaged and costLy to
operate. Port operations in Port Vila are complicated, because port facili-
ties are in three separate locations. The main wharf in Santo is earthquake-
damaged, vulnerable to complete collapse at any time. Most port facilities
are dilapidated. The majority of the islands has no loading/ unloading
facilities for inter-island ships. Comodities are collected and distributed
from over 150 anchorages throughout the country, using very small boats as
lighters. These boats usually have no fixed place to berth and hence they use
beaches to effect the transfer of cargo. This method of loading and unloading
is both slow and very costly.
19.       By comparison, air transport is the most effective mode of transport
in Vanuatu. The country has one international airport at Vila, which is
regularly serviced by five international carriers. However, due to runway
length restrictions, only medium-size jets can land and take-off at less than
full capacity load. Simple airstrips are scattered throughout the country,
the majority with unpaved runways, no navigation aids or passenger/cargo
facilities. Regularly scheduled and generally reliable air transport services
to all larger islands are provided by Air Melanesie, a private carrier.
20.       To sum up, the current less-than-satisfactory condition and limited
area coverage of the transport system in Vanuatu have been impeding national
economic and social development. A substantial part of Vanuatu's population
has at prese-r no access to basic transport services and amenities and
economic development in most regions is constrained o07ing to a lack of trans-
port infrastructure and services. Together with high costs of transporting
cargo elsewhere, these conditions have a serious dampening effect on the
country's development efforts.
21.       Development Effort.  Transport sector development planning in
Vanuatu is done in the National Planning and Statistics Office (NPSO). With
substantial expatriate assistance, NPSO is in the process of establishing
formalized procedures for planning, programming and budgeting of the required
improvements in transport infrastructure and services. Responsibility for
formulation and enforcement of transport sector regulations lie with the
Ministry of Transport (MOT). Construction and maintenance of most transport
infrastructure rests with the Public Works Department (PWD), which is part of
MOT. While MOT's organization is skeletal, and professional staff is scarce,
PWD is an effective, well-established and staffed organization, capable to
undertake civil works of significant scale. However, PWD's capability to deal
with construction and maintenance needs is constrained by a shortage of
required facilities and equipment.
22.       For transport sector development, the FNDP focuses essentially on
urgently required system rehabilitation and upgrading. For the period 1982 -



- 7 -
1986, Vt 2,089 million, or 181 of the total planned capital expenditures, are
allocated to transport. On average, 8% of annual current expenditures are
earmarked for the transport sector. Road user charges collected by the
Government in 1984 amounted to Vt 208 million, or equivalent to 365% of
current expenditures on roads during that year. With assistance by the ADB
the Government will consider changes in its current pricing policies related
to the use of maritime infrastructure, with a view to increased user
participation in operating and maintenance costs of these facilities.
The Education Sector
23.       Prior to Independence, the two distinct systems of education in
operation under the British and French administrations varied not only in
language but also in the curricula, cost of instruction, and access to post
seccndary educational facilities. The Government's task now is to develop a
homogeneous educational system to meet the country's future needs.
24.       At present, there are 244 primary schools and ten secondary schools
in the country. A significant feature of the education system is high access
to primary education; primary school enrollments in 1984 represented about 87%
of the school-age population, which compares favorably with other countr_es in
the region. At the secondary level, a shortage of student places limits the
enrollments to 10% of the age group, low by regional standards. Access to
higher education is also relatively restricted, equivalent to only 2% of the
relevant age group.
25.       As a follow-up to the Education and Training Sector Report (para. 2)
a number of more detailed studies have been carried out in preparation for the
formulation of the next Five-Year Development Plan. IDA staff are working
with the Government on the analysis of education sector investment priorities
in order to draw up a medium-term development program for the! sector.
26.       In early 1985, two cyclones severely damaged schools in the northern
region of the country, forcing the Government to relocate students in
temporary shelters or to transfer them to other schools with an overcrowding
of the facilities. The Government attaches very high priority to maintaining
adequate access to primary education throughout the country, for which these
school facilities are essential. The proposed multiproject makes provision to
meet urgent reconstruction needs of primary schools.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project Background
27.       In March 1985, the Government of Vanuatu approached the ADB for
assistance in financing of a program for urgently needed transport infrastruc-
ture improvements and reconstruction of cyclone-damaged schools on islands in
the northern part of the country. A pre-appraisal mission, which reviewed the
proposed program in July 1985, found that the components of the proposed
program were economically justified and constituted high priority invest-



-8-
ments. Agreement was, therefore, reached with the Government for the ADB to
process the loan request as a multiproject lending operation, involving the
transport and education sectors. A joint AD3/IDA mission, with ADB in the
lead (para. 15), visited Vanuatu thereafter, in September 1985, to appraise
the project for an ADB loan and an IDA credit. The ADB's multiproject
appraisal report, dated November 1985, is distributed separately. The ADB
Loan and Technical Assistance Credit were negotiated in Vanuatu in October
1985, and approved by the ADB's Board of Directors on December 5, 1985. The
IDA Credit was negotiated in January/February 1986. Supplementary credit and
project data is provided in Annex III.
Project Objectives
28.       The project would aim at improving road transport networks on five
islands with the highest growth potential in agriculture, and at establishing
effective interface between land and sea transport on each of these islands.
Improved transport infrastructure is expected to increase production of copra
and other cash crops and will lower the costs of transporting export commodi-
ties and distributing consumption goods within the local economy. The project
would also support the urgently required reconstruction of cyclone-damaged
schools on four islands in the same region. The proposed IDA credit would
help finance the proposed transport subproject; the ADB would cover financing
for both transport and education subprojects (para. 36).
Project Description
29.       Road rehabilitation and upgrading.  This component would comprise 62
km of roads on the islands of Vanuatu Lava, Epi, Paama, Maewo and Ambae.
Existing road networks on these islands are badly deteriorated. Most of the
roads are one-lane earth tracks with poor alignments, with no drainage and no
bridges for crossing watercourses. Under the project, these tracks would be
improved to two-lane standard with moderate alignments and a gravel surface,
allowing all weather traffic. Effective drainage would be installed and
simple structures of modest nature for bridging would be constructed. The
per-kilometer cost of these improvements would be comparatively low, at
US$20,000 equivalent on average.
30.       A 300 m long by-pass of Santo Port would be constructed with two-
lanes and a bituminous riding surface. At present, the main road between
Santo and the airport runs through the port area and causes severe impediments
to port operations.
31.       Wharves.  Six wharves would be constructed at suitable locations
aLong the coasts of the island where the road improvement works would take
place. The wharves would be the terminal point of the respective road net-
works on each of these islands, none of which has at present cargo handling
facilities for inter-island transport. The length of the wharves would range
between 12 and 50 m, depending on local conditions, to enable berthing of a
standard 100 GRT inter-island ship. The average width of all wharves would be
7m. The wharves would be composed of reinforced concrete superstructure,
supported by steel tube piles. The applied engineering standards would
reflect least-cost solutions in design, utilized materials, and construction



arrangements. The average cost per wharf of all associated construction works
would be about US$300,000 equivalent.
32.       Detailed Engineering for Santo Port Development.  Santo port is
important for maintenance of copra exports and imports of general cargo for
the northern part of Vanuatu. Under the project, detailed engineering work
would be carried out to establish remedial measures for the dilapidated port
facilities (para. 18) and to determine the extent of required construction
works and equipment needs which would be associated with port expansion needs
to meet projected future traffic. The Government is pursuing donor assistance
for the port expansion.
33.       School Reconstruction.  Out of the 34 primary schools on the islands
of Espiritu Santo, Ambae, Haewo and Pentecost (which suffered heavy cyclone
damage), nine main schools, including classrooms, dormitories and teacher
houses, would be reconstructed. The average reconstruction cost per school
complez would be around US$70,000 equivalent.
Status of Project Preparation
34.       The joint ADB/IDA project appraisal (para. 27) was carried out on
the basis of engineering assessments of construction/reconstruction needs and
associated costs; expected project benefits were determined on the basis of
available data regarding actual and projected traffic flows and transport
costs. Feasibility studies were available for all project wharves, prepared
by consultants (Posford, Pavry and Partners, U.K.) who were financed by the
Overseas Development Association (U.K.). While the cost and benefit data
established during appraisal were sufficient to determine the general suit-
ability of all project components for the proposed ADB and IDA financing, it
was agreed that detailed engineering and economic analyses will have to be
carried out by the Government, with the help of consultants to be engaged
under an ADB technical assistance grant of US$270,000. This grant would also
finance the Government's engaging of consultants for a review of the Govern-
ment' s pricing policies for use of its maritime infrastructures (para. 22).
During the ADB/IDA appraisal, the criteria and procedures to be adopted for
these detailed appraisals of the subprojects have been agreed with the Govern-
ment and include a cut-off rate of 10% for minimum economic rate of return for
wharves and road improvements. The results of these detailed designs and
analyses (subproject evaluations) would be submitted to ADB and IDA for their
approvals before loan/credit funds could be disbursed for the subprojects
concerned.
Project Cost and Financing
35.       The total estimated project cost (based on September 1985 prices) is
about US$6.4 million equivalent, including about US$5.0 million equivalent, or
78%, in direct and indirect foreign exchange coats. An average allowance of
12.5Z for physical contingencies (US$630,000) has been made for all project
components. Price contingencies would amount to US$540,000 (or 9.5% of the
total of base cost and physical contingencies), and have been calculated on
the basis of the current ADB and IDA estimates for domestic and international

36.       The proposed IDA Credit of SDR 1.9 million (US$2.0 million) equiva-
lent, together with the ADB loan of SDR 2.8 million (US$3.0 million) equiva-
lent, would finance 10OZ of the project's estimated direct and indirect
foreign exchange costs. The balance of US$1.4 million, representing the
project's estimated local costs, would be met by the Government. IDA and ADB
would jointly finance the estimated foreign exchange costs of the proposed
road rehabilitation/upgrading and wharves construction subprojects. In
addition, the ADB would finance 100X of the estimated foreign exchange costs
of the school reconstruction works, the detailed engineering for Santo port
development, as well as the ADB loan service charge. Under a Letter of Credit
Administration between IDA and ADB, IDA funds would be administered by the
ADB. A special condition for IDA credit effectiveness would be that all
conditions precedent to effectiveness of the ADB Loan have been fulfilled.
37.       While the subprojects indicated in para. 35 are of undoubted
priority and earmarked for financing by ADB and IDA, by way of abundant
caution it has been agreed that, if on completion of detailed engineering, any
of the subprojects is dropped, it may be replaced by a new subproject,
provided that it is accorded high priority by the Government; it is at a
relatively advanced stage of preparation and subject to similar detailed
economic evaluation procedures; it has an estimated acceptable economic rate
of return (para. 34); and its estimated cost can be accommodated within the
total amount of the IDA Credit and the ADB loan.
Project Implementation
38.       The executing agency for the project would be the Government's PWD.
PWD's Director would be the Project Coordinator, responsible for overall
coordination and execution of the project; he would also oversee the prepara-
tion of the detailed appraisals for each subproject to be presented to ADB and
IDA for their approvals (paras. 34 and 37). For day-to-day project adminis-
tration, the Government would appoint a suitably-qualified Project Manager who
would report to the Project Coordinator. In carrying out his responsibili-
ties, the Project Coordinator would be assisted by a Project Coordination
Committee (PCC), consisting of the Project Coordinator (chairman) and other
senior officials from IPSO, HOT, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of
Education, the Ports and Marine Department, and the Department of the Local
Government. PCC would provide general guidance in project implementation.
The appointment of the Project Manager, and the establishment of PCC are
conditions of effectiveness of the ADB loan and the IDA Credit.
39.       Preparation of the detailed engineering design for the Santo port
would be financed under the project, from the ADB loan proceeds (para. 36).
For this purpose, the Government would hire consultants. In addition, the
project will require hiring of consultants for detailed evaluation of the
roads, wharves and school reconstruction subprojects, and to advise the
Government on changes related to its maritime infrastructure pricing
polices. These consultants will be financed under an ADB technical assistance
grant.



- 12 -
40.       In view of the important role which Local Government Councils (LGCs)
play in the construction and maintenance of such projects, the Government has
to ensure that all necessary approvals and commitments of the concerned LGCs
have been obtained for the respective works. These approvals and commitments
pertain to rights-of-way and land acquisition, access to construction
materials sources, waiver of fishing claims, and the right to build temporary
construction facilities on public or private land. Substantial progress has
been made towards compliance with these requirements; three out of four
concerned LGCs have already submitted memoranda to the Department of Local
Government, confirming their agreements on most of the points noted above.
41.       The project implementation as a whole is expected to require about
four years. The Government would ensure that the submission of all detailed
appraisal reports on individual subprojects are provided to ADB and IDA in
sufficient time to allow for timely review and approval by them, and to allow
for physical completion of the subprojects in accordance with an agreed
project implementation schedule (Annex IV).
Procurement
42.       Equipment required for road works would be procured under interna-
tional competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for
Procurement which were modeled after those of the World Bank and IDA provided,
however, that suppliers and contractors of IDA members would be eligible to
bid on items to be funded under the proceeds of the IDA credit. Civil works
required for wharf construction would be grouped into one package, suitable
for ICB. Supply contracts for items expected to cost less than US$300,000
equivalent (minor equipment, tools, materials) would be awarded on the basis
of international shopping procedures (at least three price quotations are
obtained). Given the difficult local logistics and low construction standards
it is unlikely that the remaining civil works (contracts under $500,000) would
attract international contractors. They would therefore be carried out by PWD
under force account which will promote the institutional impact of the
project. Where competent local contractors are available and able to carry
out portions of the civil works required under the project, PWD may engage
local contractors in accordance with local competitive bidding procedures
acceptable to the ADB and IDA. A summary of the proposed procurement
arrangements under the project is given below:

proceeds.
/b   Does not include US$70,000 service charge on the ADB loan.
Disbursements
43.       Disbursement of IDA credit proceeds would be made on a joint basis
with ADB, for (a) 50Z of the foreign expenditures (c.i.f.) for directly
imported road construction equipment; (b) 25Z of the expenditures incurred in
road construction; and (c) 40X of total expenditures for wharf construction.
Disbursements for road reconstruction works to be carried out by force account
would be made on the basis of statements of expenditures which would be
reviewed by supervision missions.
Operation and Maintenance
44.       The Government would ensure that the equipment and facilities
provided, constructed or upgraded under the project would be properly
operated, managed, maintained and repaired. For this purpose, it would make
available sufficient financial resources.
45.       The Government would work with the concerned LGCs to establish
levies and tariffs for the use of wharves to be constructed under the project
at levels that are adequate to recover the cost of operation and maintenance
of such facilities (para. 22).



- 14 -
Accounts and Audits
46.       The PWD would maintain separate accounts for the multiproject and
each subproject. Such accounts would be audited annually in accordance with
sound auditing principles by auditors acceptable to ADS and IDA and submitted
to both as soon as available but in any event not more than nine months after
the end of the fiscal year.
Environmental Considerations
47.       None of the project works is expected to have significant adverse
environmental effects. The wharves would be constructed at sites which are
already used for lightering. Ecological values such as the presence of coral
reefs and other sensitive habitat would be taken into account during project
implementation. The effect of road works on physical resources would be kept
to a minimum level by improving existing tracks and by following appropriate
engineering and construction practices, such as the provision of drainage and
planting of vegetation over embankment slopes to prevent soil erosion.
Benefits and Risks
48.       Since Independence, the main economic aim of the Government of
Vanuatu has been to concentrate on developing the productive sectors to
increase exports and to substitute for certain imports. This strategy also
requires creating the necessary physical infrastructure to support the exports
development. Such infrastructure includes, among others, construction of
wharves, storage sheds (for collection of copra) and improvement of necessary
access roads (from inland areas to the coast). The proposed multiproject
provides for infrastructure investments in the outer islands where most of the
exports originate. The seven islands concerned account for about 502 of
Vanuatu's land area and about 402 of its total population. They are the main
areas of copra production and have good potential for further development not
only in copra but also in other export products such as forestry, beef cattle,
pepper and cocoa. High priority is, therefore, being given by the Government
to necessary investments in the transport sector in this area to promote
development and to increase exports.
49.       In the education sector, the immediate priority is to reconstruct
primary school buildings damaged or destroyed by the 1985 cyclones.
50.       A detailed assessment of the benefits from the project would be
available as the individual subprojects are fully evaluated. Qi-antifiable
benefits are expected to include increased copra collection and transport cost
savings through reduced road vehicle operating expenditures, and ship turn-
around times. Other benefits to be identified would include reduced damage
and loss of copra and benefits to other agricultural products and inward
general cargo. The proposed reconstruction of the cyclone-damaged primary
schools will enable the authorities to resume educational work without serious
impediments due to a lack of physical accommodations.



- 15 -
51.       The ADB/IDA appraisal mission made preliminary estimates of the
likely economic rates of return (ERR) for the wharves and road subprojects.
The ERR estimates range from 1OZ to 14Z.
52.       The major risk associated with the project would be delay in imple-
mentation of subprojects. To minimize such a risk, technical assistance is to
be provided by ADB to assist the Government in the preparation of the sub-
project evaluation reports and to support PWD through advisory services during
the physical implementation phase (para. 34). Regarding the approval and
comitment of the LGCs, substantial progress towards compliance with implemen-
tation arrangements has already been achieved (para. 40).
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Credit.
