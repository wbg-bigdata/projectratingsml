I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The Project aims to support the Government of Cameroon and the Urban Community of Douala
(UCD) to implement an urgent program of rehabilitation of the primary roads of Douala
connecting the port and the industrial areas among them and with their hinterlands; and strengthen
the urban road management and maintenance framework.

Since the economic and transport reforms launched in 1996 after the 1985-1995 recession, the
city of Douala is recovering its position as the nation capitale for industrial activities and services,
and the regional capitale for maritime traffic and trade. After the reforms of maritime transport
and port operations, and privatization of all land transports, the city of Douala needs to have an
efficient transport system and an excellent interface port/city and port/hinterland to complete the
improvement of the whole chain of transport. To this end, the UCD prepared in 2000 a
comprehensive traffic scheme and an urgent program of rehabilitation of the main roads to
address the most critical urban transport issues, and a City contract to improve the management
of the city and the performances of the UCD.

The project aims to support these activities.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The project would consist of three components:

(a)      Execution of an urgent urban road rehabilitation program in Douala.               The program
consists of about 38 km of existing primary roads connecting the port and the industrial areas
among them, to the other districts of the city and to the intercity road network; the pavement will
be rebuilt, sidewalks and drainage system rehabilitated and improved; parking places for buses and
taxis, traffic lights, road signs, and safety will be improved.

(b)      Consultant services for program implementation, audits and monitoring, and for capacity
building for urban road management and maintenance, and preparation of an urban development

program for Douala and other cities, included review of the waste management system in Douala.

(c)      Operating costs of the project unit and the environmental unit of the Ministry of Public
Works for project implementation and monitoring.

Components:

(a) Rehabilitation program
(b) Consultant services
(c) Operating costs




I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
DOUALA - Republic of Cameroon.


B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)

Comments: The environmental classification is justified, because this project involves only rehabilitation of
urban roads and will use the existing right of way. The latest study does not mention that land take or
compensation to potentially affected people will be an issue.

The latest designs of the road and drainage rehabilitations convincingly show that no people live or carry out
businesses along these roads. There are no structures that will be affected along these roads (total 38
kilometers). In case there are informal businesses (cigarette sellers, fruit stands, etc), these business people will
be able to take their stand to another place nearby while the constructions are going on.

Should a case present itself where any people would be affected negatively (for example due to unexpected
changes in road design or because of material deposits or the like), the project documentation, including the
contractor's contracts, will contain the provision for the Operational Directive (OD) 4.30 to be applicable.

When the markets will be rehabilitated they should include public toilets and water points.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The project is a straightforward infrastructure project of mainly repaving and rehabilitating the existing urban
   roads. For the rehabilitation of the roads, earth from quarries (existing or new) might be needed.
   Environmental standard operating procedures developed by the Environment Unit of the Ministry of Public
   Works, Roads Department, will be applied to the project, including the presence of an environmental
   specialist for work supervision. The consultant and contractor have to include an environmental
   management plan (EMP) in the final project design and in the program of works. This EMP should be
   approved by the Environmental Unit of the Roads Department. The issue of the discharge of waste oil from
   car engines is likely one of the major polluters in Douala.


II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.


II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.


II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
There are no feasible alternatives for existing urban road rehabilitation programs. Standard construction
   techniques will be used, as applied worldwide by road contractors.

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The quarries that would be used would be managed according to the rules established by the Direction
d'Environnement on the subject. The Environment Unit of the Ministry of Public Works of the Roads
Department will be fully involved in monitoring the environmental/social aspects of the rehabilitation
works. A pilot approach will be tested to minimize the pollution caused by the discharge of waste oil from
car engines through an analysis of feasible collection and recycling mechanisms and associated costs to
carry out such an operation.

The project will improve road safety by several means, i.e. traffic lights, special areas for bus stops and
taxi parking, improvement of side walks. The Unit in charge of the road maintenance will handle the
drainage network. In addition, the project will finance a study to review the solid and liquid waste
management system for the whole city. Implementation of a solid and liquid waste management plan will
be included in the upcoming urban development program.


II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders are people living and having their businesses along the roads to be rehabilitated and other
city roads users. Other key stakeholders include: transport unions, representatives of the industry sector, the
Port of Douala and traders. The roads to be rehabilitated are major urban arteries. The Environmental

Analysis for the project will be made available for comments to the people along the roads to be
rehabilitated and other stakeholders. The availability of the EA will be announced in the newspapers.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.

[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
         management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
         technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar
         projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
         issues.
