MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA
FOR A THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.      I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Independent State of Papua New Guinea for the equivalent of
US$17.2 million to help finance a third telecommunications project. The loan
would be repaid over 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.  Part of the proceeds of the loan (US$16.25 million)
would be on-lent by the Government to the Post and Telecommunicatio.a Corporation
(PTC) at 3% above IBRD interest rate for 15 years, including a five year grace
period.  The Borrower will bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.      Background.   Telecommunications  services  in Papua New Guinea are
inadequate to meet present and future needs of the economy. PNG has fewer than
one telephone line per hundred persons, a telephone density much lower than other
countries in the region (e.g., Fiji 4.4, Western Samoa 4.0, Vanuatu 3.0 lines
per hundred persons). Telephones are concentrated in urban areas, and the widely
dispersed rural population have fewer than one line per thousand persons.
3.      PTC is a commercial statutory authority (CSA).  It provides all public
telecommunications services in PNG. In 1987, in response to the Government's
request for assistance in developing strategies to improve sector performance,
the Bank prepared a Telecommunications Policy Options paper and funded (through
a PPF) a Network Development Plan and a Management Review of PTC. These three
studies identified major sector deficiencies including inappropriate sector
policies, limited institutional autonomy, inadequate tariff policy, inappropriate
strategy for providing access to service, low productivity due to the lack of
skilled staff and high turnover of expatriate staff, and inadequate investments.
The absence of performance targets (except rate of return) has acted as a
disincentive to PTC's management to expand facilities and increase access to
telecommunications services. The Government's control of PTC through detailed
approval  procedures  has  diluted  PTC  management's  responsibility  and
accountability. High operating costs, resulting from managerial inefficiency
and low productivity, have been passed on to subscribers through high tariffs.
4.      The country's geography makes physical communications difficult; wide
dispersion of its population in rural areas requires the Government to give high
priority to provision of adequate telecommunications facilities and manage them
efficiently to support the country's economic development.   The Government
recognizes the need to change its approach to management of its CSAs, includ-
ing PTC, to achieve its goals of sustained economic growth, creation of income-
earning opportunities in rural areas, and reduction of social and economic ine-
qualities. A Telecommunications Policy Paper was approved by the Government,
which would increase access to telephone service by installing public telephones
in urban and rural areas; improve network service quality; reduce tariffs in real
terms at least 2% p.a. and review its tariff structure with expert advice; and
increase PTC's productivity 3% p.a. while maintaining PTC's financial perform-
ance.



- 2 -
5.      Rationale  for BAnk  Involvement.    The Bank has had two previous
telecommunications sector operations in PNG, Loan 546-PNG for US$7 million in
1968 and Loan 852-PNG for US$10 million in 1972. Project Completion Reports for
these operations consider them to have met their objectives of building the basic
infrastructure of the telecommunications network under difficult physical condi-
tions and developing full commercial accounting in the Posts and Telegraph
r-epartment. Changing government sector priorities following independence in 1975
led to suspension of Bank involvement in the telecommunication sector in PNG.
The Government is now pursuing increased sector efficiency as a high priority
and has asked the Bank to renew support to the telecommunications sector. The
Bank's ongoing involvement over the medium term would help overcome current
sector deficiencies by assisting with policy reform, institution building and
network rehabilitation and expansion.
6.      Project Obiectives.   The proposed project aims to expand access to
service in urban and rural areas, reduce PTC's operating costs and improve
service for all subscribers. Specifically, the project would: (a) assist the
Government to prepare and implement appropriate sector policies, regulations and
procedures; (b) improve PTC's institutional efficiency through a training
program; and (c) rehabilitate and expand existing telecommunications facilities.
7.      Project Description.  The project components are:  (a) rehabilitate
about 27,000 existing subscriber lines, (b) expand local telephone service by
about 10,000 new subscriber lines, (c) install new transit exchanges, (d) expand
and rehabilitate the long-distance network, (e) replace the international earth
satellite station, (f) introduce data communications and improve telex services,
(g) replace obsolete HF radio communication stations with new stations,
(h) assist the Department of Finance and Planning to improve the performance
monitoring of PTC and train its staff, (i) train PTC's national engineers, (j)
second PTC national engineers and managers to appropriate telephone companies,
(k) introduce a modern management information system, (1) increase PTC's cus-
tomer focus by the creation of district offices, and (m) improve PTC's organi-
zational structure.
8.      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$76.0 million equivalent
with a foreign exchange component of US$64.1 million (84%). The proposed loan
would finance US$17.2 million or 23% of project costs, suppliers' and export
credits would finance US$16.4 million (21%), and PTC would finance $42.4 mil-
lion (56%, including local costs). The loan would include retroactive financing
of up to US$1.5 million for expenditures in technical assistance to prepare the
policy paper and MIS components and software made after May 31, 1989. PTC has
received financial offers from the Federal Republic of Germany, Belgium, France,
Japan and Australia for the exchanges. Contracts are expected to be awarded in
March 1990. PTC received financial offers from Japan, the United Kingdom and
Malaysia for the transmission equipment. Contracts are expected to be awarded
in May 1990.  These measures will complete the suppliers' and export credit
financing.
9.      A breakdown of the project costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A.   Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.  A timetable of key project
processing events and status of Bank Group operations in Paylna New Guinea are



- 3 -
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 8059-PNG, is being distributed separately.
10.     Actions Agreed.  The Government has approved a policy paper prior to
negotiations. During negotiations, agreement to the following was reached with
the Government and PTC: (a) the Government will not make any material changes
in its Policy Paper without prior consultation with the Bank; (b) PTC will submit
audited financial statements to the Bank within 9 months of the close of the
fiscal year; (c) project accounts including those for the Special Account will
be audited annually by an independent auditor satisfactory to the Bank. Copies
of the unaudited annual project accounts will be sent for review to the Bank
no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year, and copies of the
audit report not later than nine months after the end of each fiscal year; and
the auditor's report will include a statement that funds disbursed against
statements of expense (SOEs) were used for the purpose for which they are
provided; (d) the Government will appoint the consultants for the technical
assistance component of the project before August 31, 1990; (e) PTC will execute
an institutional action plan, according to the dates contained in the plan, which
includes measures to improve institutional performance, operational efficiency,
training and localization; (f) PTC will carry on its operations in accordance
with performance indicators acceptable to the Bank; (g) PTC will take the
necessary steps to ensure a debt-service coverage of 2.0 and an operating ratio
of 85% for the years 1990-92 and 80% for 1993 and following; (h) PTC will take
the necessary steps to ensure it obtains a rate of return of at least 13% on
average net fixed assets from 1990 onward; and (i) the Government and PTC will
take all measures necessary to secure the right to use all land needed for the
project at least 6 months before the date of commencement of construction at each
site. Effectiveness of the financing arrangements for the suppliers' and export
credits for the provision of the exchanges for the first two years (1990-91)
under the project will be a condition of disbursement of the transmission
equipment component. The execution of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement on behalf
of the Borrower and PTC under terms and conditions approved by the Bank is a
condition of loan effectiveness.
11.     Benefits.  The project would benefit all economic sectors in PNG.  In
particular, business subscribers would benefit from the better quality of service
resulting from modernization of the network, and rural subscribers from greater
access to telecommunication services.  sne direct benefit would be increased
efficiency and productivity of the telecommunications sector achieved through
revised sector policies and institutional improvement of the operating entity.
The economic rate of return is projected to be 26.0%.
12.     The main risks to the project are delays in  (a) implementing policy
changes, (b) institution building and (c) land acquisition. The first risk has
been minimized by Cabinet adoption of the Telecommunications Policy Paper prior
to negotiations. Technical assistance and adequate staffing of the CSA unit in
DOFP to monitor PTC's financial and operating performance will provide addi-
tional safeguards.   The second risk will be reduced by better management
information systems to assist the Board and senior management of PTC to monitor
the progress on staff training, localization, cost reduction and inicreased
efficiency. Finally, the risks associated with land acquisition have been
minimized since PTC has designed most of its network expansion program to use



. 4 -
existing repeater station sites. Only three new sites are required by 1992.3,
and the Government and PTC have made a commitment to acquire them in a timely
manner (para. 10i). The project is expected to have no adverse Impact on the
environment or public health.
13.     Recommenda1w. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply wlth
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and I recoamend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
