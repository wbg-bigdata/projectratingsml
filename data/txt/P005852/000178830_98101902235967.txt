INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY), for
the equivalent of US$15.5 million on standard terms, to help finance a high-
way project. The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development intends to
participate in financing the project with a loan of US$15.3 million equivalent.
The loan is expected to bear a 1 percent interest for a term of 40 years, in-
cluding 10 years of grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMIY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of the
People's Democratic Republic of Yemen" (189a-YDR), dated November 7, 1973,
was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 15, 1973 (R73-262).
A small mission visited the country in February 1975 and its findings are
reflected below. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        PDRY became independent in 1967. Building effective Government
administration in and outside Aden then became an immediate need. With a
sudden loss of expatriate administrators, and the subsequent emigration
(mainly to YAR) of a number of educated Yemenis following internal political
struggles, this was a difficult task in the short-term. However, consider-
able progress has been made in recent years. Government policies give a
leading role to the public sector. Nationalization of the banking and in-
surance sectors, of port services, of virtually all petroleum distribution,
and of office and residential buildings, combined with the establishment of
state trading companies, brought almost all service activities into the
public sector. Agrarian reform has also been introduced.
4.        Political and social change since independence coincided with an
economic recession. The withdrawal of British forces in 1967 and the closure
of the Suez Canal in the same year, left the modern service-oriented economy
in and around Aden with an approximately 30 percent smaller regional income
and roughly 20,000 people without employment. Total GDP dropped by perhaps
20 percent between 1966 and 1968 and virtually stagnated in subsequent years.
However, agriculture, the subsistence mainstay for over two-thirds of PDRY's
estimated population of 1.6 million, was little affected. GNP per capita
was probably about $100 in 1972.
5.        In the face of these difficulties, fiscal performance has been
remarkable. Budgetary policies have been conservative and effective. Rev-
enue increased from $15 million in 1968/69 to an average of $36 million in



1971/72 and 1972/73, following new taxes. Severe measures were taken to
reduce expenditures, which dropped by approximately one-third in 1968/69,
partly due to heavy salary cuts imposed on the civil service and the armed
and security forces. In recent years, however, the need for expansion of
education, health, social services and government administration outside Aden
has absorbed the rise in revenues; as a result, budget deficits have been wi-
dening. Budgetary deficit averaged about $9 million in 1969/70-1971/72 and
about $26 million in 1972/73-1974/75.
6.        The stoppage of British budgetary grants and the withdrawal of the
British forces immediately following the country's independence in 1967 put
the balance of payments under severe pressure. This pressure was subsequently
reduced by the substantial inflow of transfers from Yemenis working abroad,
some foreign aid, stringent import control measures, and the establishment of
small import substitution industries. However, the rise in oil prices and the
international inflation which affected the prices of imports in the last two
years have resulted in a worsening of the balance of payments. The current
account deficit for 1974 is estimated at $92 million, compared to $52 million
in 1973 and $29 million in 1972. Net inflows of non-monetary capital of about
$50 million and the utilization of the IMF Oil Facility could not fully offset
the current account deficit, and foreign exchange reserves of about $61 mil-
lion at the end of 1973 declined by an estimated $31 million in 1974.
7.        With its heavy dependence on imports, PDRY's economic difficulties
have been accentuated since 1973 by the international price rises, particu-
larly of imported fuels and foodstuffs. They have worsened domestic infla-
tionary pressure, affected the budgetary situation because of the increase
in subsidies for some mass consumption items and affected unfavorably the
feasibility of implementing essential development projects because their
foreign exchange costs increased sharply. Domestic prices rose 25 percent
in 1974, compared with 16 percent in 1973 and with 5 percent annually in
previous years. PDRY's net imports of petroleum were estimated to have in-
creased to about $33 million in 1974 from $9 million in 1973, despite the
Government's effort to keep the volume of imports in 1974 at the same level
as in the previous year. Measures to curb demand included increases in
gasoline prices, higher power rates and cutbacks in power supplies. The
PDRY has been included in the list of Most Seriously Affected Countries
and received from the IMF an Oil Credit Facility of $11 million in 1974.
OAPEC also provided another $11 million to finance oil imports.
8.        To lessen the country's dependence on the service sectors, the
Government has been making serious efforts to diversify the economy. In
view of the scarcity of known natural resources and inadequate infrastruc-
ture, particularly roads, the process has been both slow and difficult.
Agriculture, including the fisheries sub-sector, is one of the few areas
offering development -pportunities. There is also scope for small-scale
industrial activity, which would help broaden the productive sector of
PDRY's economy and reduce unemployment in urban areas.



- 3 -
9.        PDRY's first Three-Year Development Plan (1971/73-1973/74) and its
current Five-Year Plan (1974/75-1978/79) seek to expand agricultural pro-
duction (including fisheries) and establish light industries using local raw
materials. The Five-Year Plan allocates almost 40 percent of the total Plan
investment of $219 million for agricultural and fisheries development. It
also envisages the construction of roads to connect the various governorates
with Aden, as well as to link towns in the hinterland; about 21 percent has
been allocated for road construction. About 19 percent of planned capital
outlays are allocated to education, health and housing, 9 percent to public
utilities and 5 percent to industry. In view of the fiscal constraints and
rapid price changes, the Government has adopted a system of annual plans to
ensure flexibility in the implementation of the Five-Year Plan. The revised
allocation for the 1974/75 Plan is $80 million, i.e., about $26 million high-
er than in the Five-Year Plan. This increase reflects partly the rise in
cost, but largely the inclusion of externally financed, short gestation
period projects in fisheries and agriculture.
10.       Since domestic financial, as well as managerial and technical,
resources are extremely limited, much of the public investment has in the
past been financed and implemented with foreign assistance. The Kuwait Fund
for Economic Development is engaged in financing a project to increase pro-
duction, especially of cotton, in the Abyan Delta. The Arab Fund for Social
and Economic Development is also financing a fish processing project in Al
Mukalla. The People's Republic of China is constructing the Am Ayn-Mukalla
road, to be completed in 1977. The USSR has financed major irrigation works
in the Wadi Tuban area. A large textile factory has just been completed with
Chinese assistance and a flour mill with East German help. Oil exploration
with the collaboration of the Algerian company SONATRACH, and mineral explora-
tion witli help from the USSR, are underway. About 54 percent of the investment
under the current Five-Year Plan is to be financed by foreign sources. PDRY
has recently launched a number of initiatives to mobilize these resources.
Socialist coutntries, notably the People's Republic of China and the USSR, are
being urged to step up project support. Efforts have also been intensified to
obtain aid from Western Europe and Arab oil-producing countries under what is
officially termed "the new outlook" in PDRY's foreign relations. Diplomatic
relations with the Federal Republic of Germany, severed during the 1967 Mid-
dle East war, are being resumed, and contacts have already been made with
Arab oil-producing countries in the Gulf. However, these efforts are likely
to produce significant results only over time. Meanwhile, PDRY continues to
depend heavily on the aid flows provided by socialist countries and the Asso-
ciation.
11.       The rate of implementation of the first Three-Year Plan was slow.
Only 52 percent of the planned amount was actually spent. The lag in imple-
mentation reflected difficulties in project preparation and in negotiations
with bilateral aid donors, as well as scarcities of local skills for efficient
pro>ect execution. These difficulties are likely to be reduced only gradually.
12.       The sharp increase in international prices in the last two years,
led the Government to intensify its development efforts with emphiasis on



- 4 -
quick yielding projects. Investment in 1973/74 rose to $30 million, and in-
vestment allocation for 1974/75 was increased to $80 million. These expend-
itures have provided stimulus to the economy, created new capacity and in-
creased value added. In fisheries, the most dynamic sector, output has
expanded and its quality has improved, and the future is promising as a
number of projects (e.g., two fishmeal projects) have been recently completed.
Agriculture has benefited from the expansion of road network, and the comple-
tion of several projects to increase cultivated and irrigated areas, intensif-
ication of cropping pattern, and improvement of seed varieties. In industry
13 new, mostly import-substituting factories have been established (e.g., tex-
tile, plastic wares, aluminum housewares).
13.       The authiorities expect that in 1975/76 there will be a noticeable
pickup in economic activity with GDP increasing by about 5 percent in real
terms.  The ship tonnage in Aden Port is expected to rise fivefold in the
first two years after the reopening of the Suez Canal, and to rise furthier
thereafter.   This is expected to give considerable boost to the BP refinery,
which accounts for 2/3 of industrial output in PDRY, and which has been operat-
ing far below capacity largely due to depressed activities in Aden Port.     How-
ever, the balance of payments situation in 1975 would continue to be difficult.
A current account deficit of about $100 million is anticipated. On the basis
of the current level of foreign assistance, the expected level of capital
inflow will not be sufficient to offset the projected current account deficit.
Consequently, a further decline of about $15 million in the official foreign
reserves is expected.
14.       PDRY's total external debt at the end of 1974 was about $140 million
of which $94 million was disbursed. In addition about $109 million are in-
cluded in bilateral frame agreements but were not yet committed. All aid to
PDRY has been extended on concessionary terms and the debt service ratio on
bilateral and multilateral debt is estimated to be less than 8 percent. About
70 percent of foreign assistance is provided in the form of capital goods for
specific projects, about 15-20 percent is in the form of consumer goods and
the rest is advanced in cash. It is evident that in view of the extremely
limited resources of the country, low per capita income, and the severe
constraints on the Government budget and the balance of payments, Bank Group
assistance to PDRY should continue to be on IDA terms. For the same reason
local cost financing by IDA credits would be justified.
15.       In 1969, under the Nationalization Law No. 37, the Government na-
tionalized most of the foreign-owned enterprises (mainly banks, insurance
companies and port services but not the refinery). This Law provided for
compensation in the form of 20-year Government bonds bearing interest of 2
percent. Twenty-five percent of the net annual profits of all these na-
tionalized companies were to be used for servicing these bonds. In response,
some of the foreign banks which were nationalized froze substantial Yemeni
deposits which they had transferred abroad. Immediately after the promulga-
tion of Law No. 37, the Government appointed a British firm of accountants



- 5 -
of international repute to audit the accounts of all the nationalized com-
panies and evaluate their assets. The report was submitted to the Government
in September 1971. Settlements have since been reached with three of the for-
eign banks involved. Some claimants have not found the conditions offered by
the Government to be satisfactory, and yet others have made no response to the
Government's efforts to settle all claims. Nevertheless, the Government is
continuing its efforts to reach a mutually satisfactory solution with all
claimant companies. It has offered to negotiate with the governments of the
companies concerned on the understanding that all claims on and of the Govern-
ment on these companies are once and for all settled. It has also expressed
its willingness to consider such settlement outside the terms of the 1969 Na-
tionalization Law.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
16.       The proposed credit will be the Association's fifth operation in
PDRY, bringing the total IDA commitments to $27.7 million. PDRY joined the
Bank in 1969 and IDA in 1970. Assistance to PDRY commenced in 1971, under
the First Highway Project ($1.6 million) which provided funds for feasibility
studies, including detailed engineering, some maintenance equipment and tech-
nical assistance. A Highway Engineering Credit ($0.6 million) in 1972 fi-
nanced additional technical assistance to the Ministry of Public Works (MPW)
and the detailed engineering for about 110 km of roads. The Fisheries Proj-
ect ($3.5 million) in 1973 and the Education Project ($5.4 million) in 1974
were the Association's first investment projects in PDRY.    A Supplementary
Credit ($1.6 million) for the Fisheries Project to finance anticipated cost
overruns was approved by the Board in January 1975.    Annex II contains a
summary statement of IDA credits as of April 30, 1975, and notes on the
execution of ongoing projects.
17.       The Association's program in PDRY aims at supporting the Government's
long-range economic objective of broadening the base of a service-oriented and
geographically limited economy in and around Aden, by developing the produc-
tive potentials of the other parts of the country. In furtherance of this
objective, efforts have been directed towards projects in the transport sec-
tor, which would not only help to integrate the disparate regions of PDRY,
but more importantly, link production areas with regions providing markets.
Other sectors where the Association has assisted and will continue to assist,
are in the fields of human resource development and the exploitation of the
country's agricultural potential, including the key fisheries subsector.
Technical assistance and institution-building will continue to be an integral
feature in the Association's projects.
18.       As regards future operations, the Association assisted with the prep-
aration of, and has already appraised, the Aden Port Rehabilitation Project,
which will assist PDRY to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the
reopening of the Suez Canal to attract a portion of the Canal traffic to stop



- 6 -
in Aden for refuelling, bunkering and other related services. It is anti-
cipated that such a project would have sonme salutary effect in providing both
additional employment and foreign exchange earnings, which dropped substan-
tially after the Suez Canal closed in 1967. This project is expected to be
ready for Board consideration around July 1975. An agricultural project in
the Wadi Hadramaut region, prepared by the FAO-IBRD Cooperative Progranm, has
also been appraised and could be ready for presentation to the Board in the
first half of FY76. A second fisheries project (based in a less-developed
region of PDRY) is being studied for possible lending in future years. Since
the costs of these projects are likely to be substantially more than what the
Association can provide to PDRY, efforts are being made to have Arab donor
agencies join the Association in their financing. In this way IDA projects
would act as a catalyst for increasing the inflow7 of development aid to this
country.  PDRY is not a member of IFC.
PART III - TILE TRANSPORT SECTOR AND THE ROADS SUBSECTOR
19.       When PDRY became independent in 1967, the transport system consisted
of only a few good roads around the capital city of Aden, a well-developed
port in that city, and limited connections by coastal shipping and air to the
other centers of population and economic activity which are scattered along
the country's long coastline and in a few fertile--but remote--areas. The
Government regards the provision of an efficient country-wide land transport
system as essential to its efforts for national and economic integration of
the country. A start in building up such a system was made during the Three-
Year Plan (FY1971/72-1973/74), and efforts are continuing under the current
Five-Year Plan.
20.       Highways are the principal mode of internal transport in PDRY.
However, the present network of 710 km of engineered roads and 4,800 km of
motorable tracks is, both in terms of extent and quality, insufficient to
meet the demand for transport of goods and passengers. Excluding paved roads
in municipal areas, the asphalted network consists of only 350 km radiating
from Aden. A 500 km road from Aden to Al Mukalla, the second largest town,
is presently being constructed with bilateral assistance from the People's
Republic of China and is scheduled for completion in 1977. Other road
sections are being built by force account, partly assisted by UNDP personnel
and the World Food Program.
21.       At the beginning of the Three-Year Plan, MPW which is responsible
for all aspects of road planning, construction and maintenance, vas ill pre-
pared to fulfil the important role assigned to it for the country's develop-
ment. Its organizational structure was not suited to efficient construction
and maintenance operations on a country wide basis. The exodus of expatriate
staff after independence and the subsequent departure of many skilled Yemeni
staff to other Arab countries had deprived MPW of much of the technical and
management expertise. Road construction and maintenance equipment had become



- 7 -
largely inoperable, because of improper use and insufficient maintenance as
a result of inadequate workshop facilities and lack of spare parts. Satis-
factory plans for further road developments were not available.
22.       The Association therefore assisted the Government in its efforts to
overcome these difficulties by providing under the 1971 First Highway Project,
which was financed with Credit 240 and a grant from the United Nations Develop-
ment Program, for (i) technical assistance to MPW; (ii) procurement of urgently-
needed spare parts and workshop equipment; (iii) feasibility studies to select
priority roads and (iv) detailed engineering of those roads determined by such
studies to have the highest priority. An extension of technical assistance
and further road studies were included under the 1972 Highway Engineering
Credit (S12-YDR). As part of the technical assistance, the Swedish consult-
ants "Viak" carried out in 1971 a study of the organization and operations
of all departments of MPIW concerned with roads. As a result of thlis study,
Government reorganized this Ministry in 1972 and established a Highway
Department and an Equipment Department. "Viak" then provided advisory
assistance to these new bodies for the development of operational policies
and training of staff.
23.       An adequate institutional framework for the development of the road
subsector now exists, but full implementation of the "Viak" technical recom-
mendations is hampered by PDRY's overall fiscal and personnel constraints.
To fill key positions in the roads organization and to continue on-the-job
training--particularly in road maintenance and construction--the Government
recently obtained commitments for bilateral technical assistance from the
German Democratic Republic, Hungary and USSR. Complementary to this, further
advisory assistance and training in road planning as well as a road mainte-
nance equipment element have been included under the proposed project. With
the help of the experts provided under the proposed project, the Government
agreed to review its legislation governing vehicle weights and dimensions and
to introduce appropriate highway design standards for the development of the
national highway system. In line with the general recommendations of Viak for
road maintenance, the Government has allocated YD 700,000 for the repair and
maintenance of asphalted roads in the Five-Year Development Plan and YD 527,000
for the maintenance of the national highway system in its 1974/75 budget. The
Government has agreed to continue to provide resources required for adequate
road maintenance, and the equipment included under the proposed project would
help it achieve this goal.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
24.       The roads to be built under the project, were identified in 1972
under the Feasibility Study carried out as part of the First Highway Project.
Of the 800 kms of roads then studied by the consultants, the study assigned



- 8 -
highest priority to the Al Mukalla-Saywun Road. The PDRY agencies concurred
with this recommendation, and also proposed that a spur from Al Mukalla to
Ash Shihr along the coast--improvement of which was envisaged in the appraisal
of IDA's Fisheries Project (Credit 370-YDR)--be also considered as part of
the project. The preparation work was done by the Lebanese consultants,
Dar Al Handasah, who also had carried out the feasibility study, and was
reviewed by the Association's staff as part of the supervision of the ongoing
First Highway Project and the Highway Engineering Credit. The project was
appraised in October 1973. The Kuwait Fund did not participate in the mission,
but agreed to join the Association in the financing of the project, relying
on the Association's appraisal. Since international competitive bidding for
the road construction component did not lead to an acceptable bid (see para.
28 below), further missions were made in August and November 1974 to discuss
with the Government alternative methods of project execution, and to update
the appraisal report. Credit negotiations were held in Washington from April
7 to 11, 1975.  PDRY's negotiating team was led by His Excellency Haider Abu
Baker Al Attas, Minister of Public Works and included Messrs. Nasser of the
Ministry of Planning and Kader of the Ministry of Public Works. The Kuwait
Fund was represented by Messrs. Rida, Abdul-Aal and Al Shohati.
Project Description
-25.       The project provides for (i) the construction of 358 km of road
from Al Mukalla to Saywun via Al Riyan and Al Qatn with a branch from Al
Riyan to Ash Shihr; (ii) engineering and economic studies of the Nagabah-Ataq-
Beihan-Al Ayn road (320 km); (iii) purchase of highway maintenance equipment
and spares; (iv) technical assistance to the MPW, including fellowships for
MPW staff abroad; and (v) refinancing of the outstanding balance of Engineer-
ing Credit S-12. A Credit and Project Summary is attached as Annex III. The
appraisal report (No. 732-YDR), entitled "Appraisal of a Second Highway
Project", is being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
26.       The proposed 358 km of roads would have a 2-lane, 6 m wide bitu-
minous surface-treated carriageway, with 1 m wide shoulders. They will
replace three roughly parallel tracks between the Wadi Hadramawt--one of
PDRY's most promising agricultural areas--and the coast, and substandard
road sections in the Wadi and between Al Mukalla and Ash Shihr on the coast.
The town of Al Mukalla will in 1977 be connected to Aden by the aforementioned
road now being constructed with Chinese assistance (see para. 20 above). The
engineering and economic studies for the Nagabah-Al Ayn road would provide for
updating and revision of existing designs for the As Said-Beihan section of
this road in accordance with the feasibility study carried out under the First
Highway Project and for the preparation of the continuation of the road from
As Said to Nagabah and from Beihan to Al Ayn. These studies, involving about
80 man-months of expert time, would complete the preparation of this important
road link between the Wadi Beihan agricultural area and the main route from
Aden to Al Mukalla. The Government is likely to propose this road for inter-
national financing when its detailed engineering is substantially completed.
The technical assistance in planning to MPW, consisting of 48 man-months of
expert time and 96 man-months of fellowships, would be a continuation of



- 9 -
the institution building effort started under the First Highway Project and
the subsequent Highway Engineering Credit and would complement the advisory
assistance from bilateral sources in road engineering, project execution and
maintenance. The provision of highway maintenance equipment and spares, would
add to MPW's capacity to adequately maintain the existing road system and that
which is being developed, accordin to a maintenance program set up with the
help of consultants under the Firsc Highway Project. During the negotiations
of the Highway Engineering Credit (S-12-YDR), the possibility of its refinanc-
ing under a subsequent highway credit was envisaged, and refinancing of the
outstanding balance of that credit is included in the proposed credit.
Project Cost and Financing
27.       The total cost of the project, including contingencies, is estimated
at about $31.8 million, of which the foreign exchange component would be
about $20.8 million (66 percent). The proposed, IDA credit of $15.5 million,
and a loan of $15.3 million, equivalent, to be provided by the Kuwait Fund,
would jointly finance the entire foreign cost and about 91 percent of the
local cost of the project. The Government's contribution will be about $1
million toward the local cost of the project. Although this represents only
a small proportion (3 percent) of total cost, it represents a major effort
on the part of PDRY in view of the severe fiscal constraints. The Kuwait Fund
loan to PDRY is expected to bear an interest rate of 1 percent for a term of
40 years, including a grace period of 10 years. An amount of up to US$60,000
would be financed retroactively as from December 1974 (and disbursed as part
of the road construction cost), to meet some of the Government's costs in
the exploration for groundwater to facilitate construction in the arid plateau
area of the project road.
28.       A financing plan for the project has been discussed and agreed with
the Kuwait Fund and the Government. The Association, the Kuwait Fund and the
Government would jointly finance the construction element of the project; the
Association would finance the complete costs of the study element and the
technical assistance element, and would refinance the outstanding balance
of the Engineering Credit; and the Kuwait Fund would finance the complete
cost of the road maintenance equipment element of the project. Satisfactory
arrangements for project administration and coordination have been discussed
and agreed with the Kuwait Fund. The Association and the Kuwait Fund would
jointly approve all contracts pertaining to construction.
Project Execution
29.       Because there has been no history of road works executed by contract
in PDRY, and the Government, the Kuwait Fund, and the Association were un-
certain of contractors' response to bidding of the project roads, international
tenders were invited for the roads included under the proposed project and
bids were opened in July 1974. A contractor unqualified to do the work sub-
mitted the only bid, which, at US$51 million, was unacceptably high and was



- 10 -
rejected. An investigation by the design consultant, Dar Al Handasah, revealed
that contractors failed to respond partly because of their unfamiliarity with
conditions in PDRY and partly because of the volume of work being contracted
elsewhere in the region, where conditions were more familiar and continuity
of business appeared reasonably assured. After very careful consideration by
the Association and discussion with PDRY representatives, it was felt that
the only means of building the urgently needed project roads would be through
force account work by the Government.
30.       Agreement has been reached that it would be best to construct the
roads concerned through a special semi-autonomous project unit to be estab-
lished under the MPW. The unit would have the authority to hire staff at
competitive wage rates, import construction materials, equipment and spare
parts free of duty and import constraints, and could thus act as a contractor.
However, as the Government does not have sufficient management and technical
expertise to operate efficiently such a special project unit and to handle
road construction work of this magnitude, an agreement has also been reached
with the Government that such a capability should be provided by an external
agency. Because of their construction management expertise and their satis-
factory past and ongoing association with PDRY, including procurement in
connection with the First Highway Project, the Government invited the UK Crown
Agents (CA) to provide the necessary management and technical expertise
required for an efficient operation of this unit. Assurances were obtained
from the Government that it will (i) take the legal and administrative actions
needed to set up the unit, and (ii) enter into a contract satisfactory to the
Association with the Crown Agents or another competent management group
acceptable to the Association, as conditions of making the credit effective.
Construction supervision will be the responsibility of the NPW who will be
assisted by the design consultant, Dar Al Handasah.
31.       Special financial arrangements have been made to enable the Special
Unit to make the principal purchases of construction equipment and materials
prior to the actual start of construction and to obtain an advance payment to
meet its mobilization costs. Subsequent payments to the unit would relate to
the actual amount of work done and be made in accordance with the measurements
of work items performed.
32.       Under the proposed Credit, MPW intends to invite proposals from in-
ternational consultants for undertaking the engineering and economic studies
of the Nagabah-Al Ayn road link, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Association.
33.       Civil works are expected to begin in late 1975, and to be completed
about March 1979; studies of the Nagabah-Al Ayn road should commence about
late 1975 and be completed about December 1976. Technical assistance to MPW,
through individual experts recruited for the purpose, on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Association, should last for about two years from mobiliza-
tion of the needed experts. A schedule for project implementation was dis-
cussed and agreed with the Borrower.



Procurement
34.       Procurement of all major items of road construction equipment and
material will be through international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank Group's Guidelines. However, in order to save time, international
advertising may be limited to at least 3 major European newspapers which,
together with the regular notification procedures, is considered adequate to
alert the most likely suppliers. As the project is not of sufficient duration
to fully depreciate the larger and more expensive construction machinery,
quotations for used mechanical equipment will also be obtained. Items most
favorably priced and best suited to the type of construction work, will then
be purchased by the Special Unit. Upon completion of the proposed project,
any residual equipment life would be applied to road maintenance. The road
maintenance equipment to be financed by the Kuwait Fund (see para. 28) under
the project will be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding.
Disbursement
35.       Separate provision is made in the proposed credit for the purchase
of construction equipment and materials to enable disbursements from the
credit account to be made for this purpose soon after credit effectiveness.
In addition, an advance payment against the direct cost of construction is
expected. Disbursements from the credit account would be made on the basis of
47 percent of the costs of construction and related engineering services and
of construction equipment and material, and of 100 percent of the cost of the
study element and the technical assistance element. For road construction,
all requests for disbursement together with supporting documents would be
sent to the Association and the Kuwait Fund upon receipt of which each in-
stitution would disburse its respective share. A projected disbursement
schedule is given in Annex III.
iconomic Justification
36.       The proposed Al Mukalla-Saywun road is a major element in the Gov-
ernment's strategy for economic integration of PDRY. It would substantially
reduce transport cost and travel time between the Wadi Hadramaut and the pop-
ulation centers along the coast and thereby both improve export conditions
for existing and planned agricultural production in the Wadi and open up a
new and sizeable market for the coastal fishing industry. The project's
coastal road will initially improve the road connection between the fishing
town of Ash Shihr and Al Mukalla, from where a paved road to Aden will soon
be completed, and will ultimately become part of the main road connection to
the eastern part of the Republic. The Association is associated with the de-
velopment in the Wadi Hadramaut through an agricultural project, which was
prepared in 1973/74 by the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program and which was ap-
praised in February 1975, and with the development of the fishing industry
througlh the ongoing Fisheries Project. Quantifiable benefits of the proposed
investment which have been considered in the economic evaluation are savings



- 12 -
in vehicle operating costs to existing and generated traffic, reductions in
road maintenance and repair costs and the avoidance of spoilage of fish dur-
ing transport to the Wadi Hadramaut area. On this basis, the economic return
on the investment in road construction is estimated at about 15 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
37.       The drafts of the Development Credit Agreement between the People's
Democratic Republic of Yemen and the Association, the Recommendation of the
Committee provided for in Article V, Section I(d) of the Articles of Agree-
ment of the Association, and the text of the resolution approving the pro-
posed credit, are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
38.       The special features described in paragraphs 23 and 30 of this Re-
port are reflected in Sections 4.02, 4.03, 4.04, 3.03 and 3.04 of the draft
Credit Agreement. The special procurement features described in paragraphs
29 and 34 of this Report are reflected in Sections (A), (B) and (C) of Sched-
ule 3 to the draft Credit Agreement.
39.       An additional condition of effectiveness is that the Loan Agree-
ment between the Kuwait Fund and PDRY has, or will concurrently with the Credit
Agreement, become fully effective (Section 6.01(a) of the draft Credit Agree-
ment). The additional condition of effectiveness described in para. 30 of
this Report is reflected in Sections 6.01(b) and (c) of the draft Credit
Agreement.
40.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit Agreement
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
41.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

C.   Projects in Execution 1/
Cr. No. 240-YDR - Highway Project; US$1.6 Million Credit of April 21, 1971;
Closing Date: March 31, 1976
This project consists of (a) feasibility studies of selected roads;
(b) detailed engineering of about 240 km. of roads; (c) highway workshop and
communications equipment and spare parts for existing highway maintenance and
workshop equipment; (d) provision of technical assistance team to advise and
assist in improving the organization, operations and methods of the Public
Works Department (PWD); and (e) overseas fellowships for PWD local staff.
Technical assistance by consultants and overseas staff.training was financed
by UNDP with the Association acting as Executing Agency. The consultants'
services, the staff training and the feasibility studies have been satis-
factorily completed. Delays have occurred in equipment procuremnent, largely
due to the Government's cumbersome purchasing system.    To allow full utiliza-
tion of credit funds, the original closing date of June 30, 1974 has been
postponed to March 31, 1975. Spares for road maintenance equipment have been
delivered; the workshop equipment has been ordered and is being delivered.
However, since not all items arrived in time, the Association agreed to a
further extension of the closing date to March 31, 1976.
Cr. No. S-12-YDR - Highway Engineering Project: US$0.6 Million Credit of
November 17, 1972; Closing Date: March 31, 1975
This engineering credit was provided to help finance (a) detailed
engineering of about 110 km of roads, review and amend existing detailed
engineering of about 35 km; and (b) extension of technical assistance which
already started under the previous project. The detailed engineering has
been satisfactorily completed. The original closing date of June 30, 1974
was postponed to March 31, 1975, to accommodate a further extension of tech-
nical assistance by consultants to the Public Works Department. The credit
has been fully disbursed and the credit account was closed as of March 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 370-YDR - Fisheries Project: US$3.5 Million Credit of April 12,
1973 and $1.6 Million Supplementary Credit of February 6, 1975; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
Due to delays in finding a suitable Project Manager, the original
credit became effective only on February 12, 1974. Since then, project
implementation on the whole is proceeding satisfactorily. A supervision

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular, to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken

mission in June 1974 reported that price and physical contingencies included
in the project were insufficient to cover increases in project cost, which
were mainly due to both foreign and domestic inflation. Since the scope
of the project could not reasonably be reduced and no other sources of fi-
nancing were available, the Association agreed to a supplementary credit of
$1.6 million to cover the increased foreign cost of the project. This sup-
plementary credit became effective on April 29, 1975. Bid's for the shore
facilities in Al Mukalla and Ash Shihr were due on February 14, 1975, but no
bids were received. The design consultants investigated the reasons and their
proposals for modified procurement procedures were discussed during a supervi-
sion mission in March 1975. As a result, the Association recently agreed that
the original turnkey contract be split into several smaller contracts, of which
the larger ones would be tendered internationally. The Government's Public
Corporation for Fish Wealth, which is the main beneficiary of the project,
with the assistance of the consultants, will assume the overall responsibil-
ity for supervision and coordination of these contracts.
Cr. No. 494-YDR - Education Project; US$5.4 Million of July 12, 1974:
Closing Date: September 30, 1979
This credit, which will assist the Government in making qualita-
tive improvements in the educational system and to meet priority manpower
needs, became effective on February 5, 1975, after slight delays in setting
up the project unit. Project implementation has now commenced.
