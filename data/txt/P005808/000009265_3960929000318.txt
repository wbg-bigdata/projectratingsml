YOM   ARAB REPUBLIC
TAIZ FLOOD DISASTER PREVENTION AND MUNICIPAL
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:         Yemen Arab Republic
Beneficiary:      Ministry of Municipalities and Housing
Amount:           SDR 11.7 million (US$15 million equiv.)
Terms:            Standard IDA terms, with 40-year maturity
Project           The primary objective of the proposed project is to provide
Descrigtion:      in the city of Taiz essential flood control works for the
protection of public and private property from flood damage
and reduce the risk of loss of human life. Other objectives
are to implement a project cost recovery mechanism at a
municipal level and to promote implementation of a national
municipal resource mobilization policy, and to further
strengthen institutional capabilities of both MMNI and its main
branch offices.   The project includ-s: (i) flood control
structures consisting of open channels and box culverts,
sediment and boulder traps, at various places .n Wadis Seena,
Al Nassar, Madam and Al Kamet; (ii) the restoration of street
pavement; the conservation of soils through the terracing of
unstable slopes; surface drainage footpaths in narrow and steep
streets to control erosion; and land acquisition; (iii) the
purchase of equipment for the maintenance of roads and flood
control structures; (iv) the institutional strengthening of
MMH and its main branch offices through technical assistance;
technical  assistance  for  project  management;  (v)  the
introduction of a national municipal resource mobilization
policy and implementation of project cost recovery; (vi) the
hiring of consultants for the preparation of a future urban
development project; and (vii) the training of MMH's and its
main branch offices staff.
Benefits          The project will provide protection of public and private
and Risks:        properties against economic losses due to flood damage, and
reduce the risk of loss of human life. It will yield major
environmental improvements by eliminating the problems caused
by sediments and municipal refuse deposited by flood waters
on  major  street  intersections.    It will  also  provide
institutional strengthening to MMH and at its branch offices.
Although the project during its implementation would be exposed
to a flood damage risk, provisions have been taken, in both
project design and construction supervision, to minimize such
a risk.

YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
TAIZ FLOOD DISASTER PREVENTION AND MUNICIPAL
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE URBAN SECTOR
Country Background
1.01        The Yemen Arab Republic (YAR), situated on the southern corner of
the Arabian Peninsula, is bounded on the north and east by Saudi Arabia, on
the south by the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and on the west by the
Red Sea. Local estimates give its area as approximately 200,000 square
kilometers. Although it is known that such minerals as copper, iron, sulphur,
zinc, silver, gold and uranium exist, no thorough studies or research have
been done and none of the known minerals is being exploited with the exception
of salt and oil.
1.02        Following several years of rapid economic growth and balance of
payments surpluses in the early seventies, YAR economy slowed down in the late
seventies and early eighties, and the macro-financial situation deteriorated
sharply. The levelling-off in the flow of workers' remittances and official
aid and the drought were the main causes of the economic slowdown, while the
fast increase in public expenditures and the overvaluation of the local
currency were the chief factors of fiscal and external imbalances. The
Government started to correct those imbalances in 1983, mainly by reducing
expenditures (notably investment), adjusting the exchange rate, and
restricting imports.
1.03        However, considerable inflationary pressures remained in the
economy, and the stabilization effort had to be strengthened. Considerable
progress was made during the 1985-86 period towards reducing the fiscal and
external deficits. The period 1987-89, however, witnessed a considerable
relaxation of the stabilization program, largely in anticipation of oil
exports which started in late 1987, and a marked deterioration occurred in the
macro-financial position and in the incentive system.
1.04        While oil and gas revenues (discovered in 1984) and a continuation
at present levels of traditional foreign exchange receipts could improve the
country's economic prospects, the uncertainties about these key parameters and
the country's great need for more and better public services call for more
efficient use of oil revenues and caution in fixing growth targets and in
managing the external debt. Even with correct macro-economic policies, YAR's
development prospects are limited unless the Government addresses two long-
term issues; namely, the increasing water scarcity (particularly around
Sana'a) and the rapid urban population growth.



- 2-
PoDulation Growth and the Urban Sector
1.05        Urbanization in YAR is the lowest (16 percent of the total
population of 9.3 million) but fastest growing throughout the Middle East.
This rapid urbanization started in the early 1970s as a result of a high rate
of income increase, stagnation of agriculture, and growth of Government
services.
1.06        The urban population is quite widespread with a moderate
concentration in the three largest cities, as the regional differentiation of
economic functions has prevented the overwhelming primacy of one city. The
1986 populations of Sana'a, the capital, Taiz, the principal trading and
agricultural processing center, and Hodeidah, YAR's main port, were about
430,000, 180,000 and 150,000 respectively (about 60 percent of the urban
population), while the remaining 40 percent of the urban population lived in
towns of less than 50,000 inhabitants.  The populations of Sana'a and Taiz, on
the other hand, have more than doubled over the past 5 years, growing by more
than 15 percent per annum.
1.07        As personal incomes and urban population increased in the 1970s
and early 1980s, so did the uncontrolled sprawl of informal (but fairly well
built) housing on to urban areas. However,the provision of urban services
lagged behind, despite the Government's impressive efforts. Contributing
factors to th- growth in urban service deficiencies have been the absence of a
formal land .-gistration system, failure to fully recover the cost of services
thereby eroding the Government's capacity to finance such services, and the
use of unrealistic standards unaffordable to a large segment of the
population.
Government Strategy in the Urban Sector
1.08        Until 1979, Government intervention in the urban sector was on an
ad hoc basis with the various agencies implementing their own projects
independently. In 1976, the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) initiated the
preparation of master plans for the five major cities of YAR. Although these
represented an appropriate framework for directing urban growth, they proposed
standards inconsistent with the financial and implementation capacity of the
relevant urban agencies.
1.09        Concerned with the mounting urban problems and the lack of
coordination of the activities of the various ministries and agencies, the
Government, in 1979, vested to the newly established Ministry of
Municipalities and Housing (MMH) the responsibility for the physical planning
and urban administration of the five main cities and of the secondary towns,
while the Central Planning Organization (CPO) was charged ws.th ensuring that
the national urban development policy would be consistent with the broader
national development strategies. The Government's strategy in the urban
sector, therefore, focuses on providing essential municipal infrastructure
while strengthening the institutional capabilities at the central and local
levels. In Taiz, however, the provision of municipal infrastructure has been
hampered by the recurrent floods in the Old Taiz area; addressing this problem



- 3-
is the Government's priority in Taiz.
1.10        More recently, discussions have commenced between North and South
Yemen for the yurpose of unifying the two countries under a single
constitution. A target date of November 30, 1990 has been set for the
official start of the new government, and a new ministerial structure has
already been announced for that purpose. Unification, at least in the short
term, is likely to have a signifJcant impact on future Government strategy for
the urban sector. The outcome of this process will be monitored closely in
ensuing IDA missions.
Urban Sector Organization
1.11        Although short of funds as well as qualified technical,
administrative, and managerial manpower, YAR has endeavoured to establish the
basic institutional framework for urban development and related infrastructure
services. Provision of water and sewerage, for example, is carried out by the
National Water and Sewerage Authority (NWSA), electricity is provided by the
Yemen General Electricity Corporation (YGEC), while inter urban road
construction and maintenance works are carried out by the Highway Authority
which belongs to the Ministry of Public Works (MPW). YAR also has
institutions for land survey and registration, health and education services,
public transport, co-operatives and popular participation, and housing finance
(HCB).
1.12        Urban administration and housing development is the responsibility
of MMH. The Ministry is represented at the f'overnorate level through 11
branch offices, each headed by a General Director who is appointed by the
Minister but who is administratively responsible to the Governor. The branch
offices remain closely controlled by, and financially and technically
dependent upon, the Ministry. All capital projects and maintenance activities
are centrally prepared and approved. The budgets for recurrent expenditures
are prepared locally but are proposed to and approved by central level
officials.
1.13        The Ministry's mandate includes the preparation of master plans
and related legislation for the major cities; the creation of the requisite
administrative, technical and managerial manpower for their implementation;
the protection of the environment including the provision of sanitation,
garbage collection and disposal services; and the provision of cultural and
recreational amenities and services, such as public baths, parks and gardens,
including the planting of trees.
1.14        The Ministry is also responsible for the housing of municipal
workers and street cleaners (low-income groups); the naming of streets arrs
numbering of houses; the expansion of housing development programs, the
establishment and maintenance of markets, slaughterhouses and cemeteries; the
encouragement of housing cooperatives; and, the enforcement of a rent law.

1.15        Local Councils for Cooperative Development (LCCDs), established
under Law 12 of June 14, 1985 to replace the former Local Development
Associations (LDAs), operate at the local level with open ended
responsibilities; often these responsibilities overlap with those of MMH, N'JSA
and YGEC. LCCD's funds come from building permits and cleaning fees, both
collected by MMH branch offices, and their investment programs are set in
close response to perceived local needs. LCCDs are chaired by Governors and
are organized nationally under a Federation of Local Councils (FLCCD).
IDA Strategy in the Urban Sector
1.16        Given YAR's current difficult economic situation and the mounting
pressure of its urban problems, IDA's short-term strategy in the sector is
focused on well targeted project work requiring minimum and directly
recoverable investment with maximum use of existing resources. This project
work is aimed at enhancing IDA dialogue with the Yemeni authorities while at
the same time serving as a vehicle for addressing institutional and structural
weaknesses (urban infrastructure maintenance, municipal resource mobilization,
land registration and housing finance), by building on the achievements
already obtained from the first two ongoing urban projects (para 1.18).
1.17        This process is aimed at preparing the groundwork for broader
policy oriented sectoral involvement and to set the stage for the principal
element of urban development strategy for the long term, i.e., the creatien of
a viable administrative system which, as it develops, will delegate more
=esponsibility to the municipalities and, at the same time, maximize private
initiative. In the short run, however, it is expected that tne central
government will continue its policy of a highly centralized system.
IDA Involvement in the Urban Sector
1.18        IDA lending for urban infrastructure started in 1974 with , credit
to help the Government finance the first public water supply system in Sana'a
and to strengthen NWSA which had been established in 1973.  IDA involvement in
the sector was broadened in 1979 when YAR requested assistarnce for an urban
sector review. This review (Urban Sector Report No. 2699-YAR) identifi3d the
major urban development issues and its findings formed the basis of the Sana'a
Urban Development Project (Credit No. 1202-YAR) which was approved in January,
1982. This first demonstration project was aimed at assisting the Government
to address the issues identified by the sector review , tackling specific
shelter problems, introducing the concept of mortgage financing to low-income
groups for self-help construction, while strengthening the Housing Credit Bank
(HCB).

1.19        On the basis of the principles established under the Sana'a Urban
Development Project, IDA approved the Second Urban Development Project (CR.
1441-YAR) in February, 1984. The second project continued along the
principles established under the first one by applying the same standards ir.
Hodeidah (Yemen's third largest city) while expanding MMH activities.
1.20        Overall implementation progress of the first two urban projects
has been satisfactory, however, the institutional components have been
implementing slower than what was originally envisaged. Although these two
projects are not yet completed, the main lessons learned are that (a)
considerable time should be allowed for project implementation when several
government agencies are involved requiring close coordination of actions,
particularly when institutional and financial systems such as housing finance,
selection and qualification of beneficiaries for sale of plots and houses and
revenue collection are introduced for the first time; the projects provided
only four-and-a-half vears for implementation while eight years would have
been more appropriate; and (b) adequate compensation should be provided to
attract and retain qualified local professionals for key positions. These
lessons have been taken into account in the design of the proposed project by
providing eight years for project implementation and adequate compensation for
key staff positions.
Project Rationale
1.21        The proposed project is in full agreement with Government and IDA
strategy for the urban sector as it would address a major problem of flooding
in the City of Taiz, the second largest urban area in the country, financa the
implementation of recoverable infrastructure investments, and ad&ress
structural weaknesses at the central and local levels through technical
assistance and training and policy reforms.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
General
2.01        Taiz is the main gate for trade with South Yemen; its proximity to
both Hodeidah and Mokha, the two ports on the Red Sea, make it an important
trading center. Its location within the southern highlands, the area with the
highest rainfall in the country, makes the city a thriving agricultural area.
Moreover, the city experienced a rapid annual rate of population growth (7.6
percent) over the inter-census period of 1975-1986.



6-
Physical Setting
2.02        The project area comprises the "Old City" (Medina), an ui:a of
about 100 hectares on the valley and foot hills of Jebel Sabir, 'and tne
adjacent area to the north (about 80 hectares), (IBRD Map 22143). Three wadis
(drainage courses) pass through the area: Wadi Seena on the western boundary,
and Wadi Al Nassar and Wadi Madam i.. the central area. Wadis Al Nassar and
Madam discharge into Wadi Al Kamet to the north, which, togethot with Wadi
Seena, form Wadi Taiz. Surface materials comprise alluvium (s'ind and gr&vel)
to varying depths in the valley and rock outcrops in the south where ground
levels rise.
2.03        In general, the project area is dense, compact and encircled by
remnants of an old fortress wall including the two main city gates of Bab
Sheika Musa and Bab Al Kabir on the northern boundary.  The main residential
area of multi-story houses was built to the south on steeper slopes, while the
old market place occupies the flatter alluvial land of the "Old City" at the
northern edge.
xisting Flood Protection
2.04.       Because existing wadies are being used as roads and houses have
been built in the flood plains, there is very little protection against flood
hazards. For instance, the original drainage channels of Wadis Seena, Madam
and Al Nassar, for the most part, are now main streets of residential
neighborhoods which have sprung up over the last ten years. Furthermore,
high-income housing and road construction is extending on to steep hills,
thereby destabilizing the slopes and increasing soil erosion.  Although
attempts have been made to drain rain waters from some of the major streets by
providing drainage channels, these measures are it,sufficient, and authorities
often resort to using sanitary sewers to discharge water runoffs. These
conditions increase the health hazards caused by floods as sewers plug up with
sediment and refuse, causing sewage overflows on the streets.

Rainfall and Flood Characteristics
2.05.       The mean annual rainfall for Taiz is estimated at 610 mm, ranging
between 417 mm and 853 mm. The rainy season extends from April to October
with about 80 percent of the total annual precipitation falling during this
period. A summary of daily and annual rainfall in Taiz with return periods
ranging from 1:5 to 1:100 years is given in Table 2.1 below:
Table 2.1: Daily and Annual Rainfall in Taiz
Return Period     Daily Rainfall    Annual Rainfall
(Years)                 (mm)                (mm)
5                     72                  711
10                     81                   787

100                    113                 1000
2.06        It is the short duration storms (2 hrs) that are most dangerous,
as peak flows occur during these events. Moreover, a storm event with a
massive daily rainfall of 92 mm, most of which may occur over a period of two
to three hours, happens on average every twenty years. The data shows that
downpours of this intensity can generate a flow up to 158 cubic meters per
second at the con.luence of wadis Seena and Al Kamet (Wadi Taiz), which is
powerful enough to cause major flood damage. Peak flows at various wadi
confluences for storms with return periods of 1:20, 1:50 and 1:100 years are
given in Table 2.2 below:

Major Flood Events in Taiz
2.07        The existing data show that the last severe flood occurred in
March 1982 when three days of consecutive rain caused widespread private and
public property damage, and three people drowned. Events of this magnitude
are estimated to occur once every twenty years. Floods that cause moderate



- 8 -
property damage and interrupt traffic for two to three hours occur five to ten
times annually. During moderate flooding, sedimentary material (sand, gravel
and bvulders) will accumulate to depths of up to one meter at major road
intersections. Streets sustain substantial erosion, and, in many places,
underground utilities (water, sewerage, electricity and telephone) are exposed
to pedestrian anA vehicular traffic.
Flood Imgact
2.08        Although flooding directly affects the "Old Town" and the areas
immediately to the north, it also indirectly affects most of the city as most
vehicular traffic passes through this section. Al Gamal Street is part of the
highway system linking Taiz with Hodeidah to the west, Aden to the south and
Sana'a to the north. Since the project area offers employment to people
residing in other neighborhoods, and the market and adjacent commercial area
are important trading centers, any disruptions in this area is of significance
to the city as a whole.
2.09        A flood survey undertaken during project preparation revealed that
of the 5,134 households in the project area, about 28 percent flood every year
and 32 percent flood every 10 years. Also, about 280 shops flood every year.
The annual loss in property damage and stock, to households and shops, is
estimated at about YR 29.24 millV n (US$2.7 million).
2.10        The flooding of roads, and the depositing of sediment, boulders
and refuse material, not only causes a disruption in traffic and business
activities but also entails considerable expense to clean up and repair
damaged infrastructure. Expenditures for clean-up and road repairs are
averaging about YR 1.8 million per year for the project area but are grossly
insufficient to restore street pavement given the budgetary constraints of the
Taiz Branch Office (TBO).
III. THE PROJECT
Project Origin
3.01        The proposed project was first conceived as a result of
discussions between the Director of the Taiz Branch Office of MMH and an IDA
mission carrying out an urban sector study, in YAR, in February 1984.
Initially, the project was to address urban upgrading problems in the "Old
Town" of Taiz, develop serviced land suitable for low-cost housing in Taiz,
and make improvements to urban transport in Sana'a. The project was to
include funding for a major study for flood control with physical
implementation being deferred to a future phase. An IDA mission visited the
country in January/February 1986 and reviewed the preparatory work carried out
by the Urban Development Project Unit (UDPU ) established under Credit 1202-
YAR. Agreement was reached on the composition of the project, which was then



included in the Third Five-Year Development Plan '1988-1992).  Financing of
project preparation was provided under the Second Urban Development Project
(Cr. 1441-YAR), and consultants were commissioned in November, 1987 to prepare
a feasibility study.
3.02        The study was completed in November, 1988 and indicated that flood
control should take priority over any other type of improvement in the city.
It was indicated also that any investment in upgrading the "Old Town' could be
wasted in case of failure to control the flood waters from the wadis. Thus,
by mutual agreement between IDA and the Government, the scope of the project
was modified to give priority to flood control. Furthermore, because of the
econtmic difficulties facing the country, it was agreed to divide the project
into self-standing phases of construction, and, to limit implementation under
the project to the most needed flood control structures. The urban upgrading
components were then postponed until after the flood control works are
completed.
Proiect Objectives
3.03        The main objectives of the proposed project are:
(a)   to provide most needed flood control
structures to protect private and public buildings and
infrastructure, and to minimize disruptions to the local
economy and reduce the risks to human life;
(b)   to implement a project cost recovery mechanism at a
municipal level, and to promote implementation of a national
municipal resource mobilization policy;
(c)   to strengthen the urban management capabilities
to the main branch offices; and
(d)   to strengthen MMH's institutional capacity to
address urban problems more effectively.
Project Alternatives
3.04        During the course of project preparation several alternative
design standards and primary drainage routes were considered. All of them
follow a basic design concept incorporating drainage channels and box culverts
through the built-up sections of the city, and sediment and boulder traps
upstream. They also include the channelization of secondary wadis originating
from Al Qahira Hill (Cairo Hill) to the south of the project area, and soil
conservation measures.



- 10 -
3.05        Two alternative flow parameters were considered for the design of
hydraulic structures, namely, a 1:5 year frequency flood as the minimum
acceptable protection, and a 1:20 year frequency flood as an economically
acceptable maximum protection. The impact of floods with return periods of
1:50 and 1:100 years was also considered to develop a loss-probability
analysis and identify the cost effe-tiveness and risk protection of the
proposed investment. Space constraints, due to the narrowness of the streets,
limited the design capacity that could be economically provided. It was
concluded that a hydraulic design capacity to carry 100 percent of the 1:20
year frequency flood and about 90 percent of the flood flows with a return
period of 1:50 years, would yield, within the space constraints, the least-
cost alternative and the maximum possible protection against any reasonable
risk to human life. Thus, flood waters caused by events exceeding the design
capacity (such as events occurring with a frequency of 1:50 or 1:100 years)
would be of minor or moderate impact and would pose no threat to people or
property.
3.06        Several drainage routing alternatives were also studied to
determine the least-cost solution. Diverting Wadi Seena by tunneling under a
high ridge separating two adjacent watersheds was ruled out on economic
grounds.  Diverting Wadi Al Nassar into Wadi Seena was considered the only
viable option as the streets along its natural drainage course are too narrow
to enable construction of even the minimum hydraulic capacity option (1:5
years frequency flood) without the major demolition of historical buildings in
the 'Old Town".  The only feasible option for controlling Wadi Madam flood
waters was to provide a box culvert along the streets following the natural
drainage course of the wadi.
3.07        Finally, taking into consideration the financial constraints, the
project was conceived to be implemented in phases: from essential flood
control works providing the most needed protection to the maximum investment
including urban upgrading which would enhance land development in the areas
bordering some of these wadis. Therefore, the proposed project has been
designed to provide the essential flood control works which would yield the
maximum economic benefit. Future urban upgrading improvements could be
carried out by MMH itself when the mobilization of local funds should become
possible.
Project Description
3.08        The project location and the project area are shown on maps IBRD
No. 22142 and 22143, respectively. The proposed project consists of essential
flood control structures which will provide protection to the Old Taiz area
most severely affected by floods. A de--ailed project description is given in
Annex 1 and includes:
(i)   the essential flood control structures consisting of open
channels, box culverts, sediment and boulder traps at various
places in wadis Seena, Al Nassar, Madam and Al Kamet;



v 11 -
(ii)  the restoration of street pavement; the conservation of soils
through the terracing of unstable slopes; surface drainage
footpaths in narrow and steep streets to control erosion; and land
acquisition;
(iii) the purchase of equipment for the maintenance of roads and flood
control structures;
(iv)  the institutional strengthening oZ MMH and its main branch offices
through technical assistance; and technical assistance for project
construction management;
(v)   the introduction of a national municipal resource mobilization
policy initiated under ongoing urban projects and implementation
of project cost recovery;
(vi)  the hiring of consultants for the preparation of a future urban
development project; and
(vii) the training of MMH's and its main branch offices staff.
3.09        Consultant services will be proNided to prepare a feasibility
study for a future urban development project, and on the basis of such a
study, to prepare a preliminary and a final design as well as tender documents
and technical specifications.
Status of Preoaration
3.10        A draft final design of the flood control works  was completed in
November 1989. The final design and tender documents are scheduled for
completion in June 1990.
Project Cost and Financing
3.11        The proposed project, excluding taxes and customs duties
(government projects are exempt), is estimated to cost US$22.25 million
equivalent (YR 267.00 million), of which US$15.00 million equivalent (YR
180.00 million) represents the foreign cost component (or about 67 percent).
The estimated cost by component is summarized in table 3.1 below. A more
detailed cost estimate is presented in Annex 2.

3.12        Base costs are expressed in May 1990 prices.  Cost estimates were
prepared by consultants and revised during appraisal based on the final
design, soil investigations, and a survey of construction costs undertaken
during project preparation, which reflect recent tenders for similar work in
the country. A 10 percent physical contingency factor has been considered for
civil works. Price contingancies have been calculated on the basis of a 4.9
percent annual increase from 1990 to 1995 and a 3.7 percent annual increase
thereafter for foreign costs; local costs have been assumed to increase at a
rate of 20 percent annual increase from 1990 to 1992 inclusive, and 15 percent
annually thereafter. The construction of the main works is programmed to be
completed by December 1996 (Annex 3).
3.13        The project cost also provides for technical assistance consisting
of an expatriate construction engineer to assist MMH in construction
supervision And an allowance for project management including salary
supplements to the Yemeni counterparts (para. 4.19); consulting services to
prepare a future urban development project (para. 3.09); and technical
advisors to strengthen MMH (para. 4.11-4.14).
3.14        The entire foreign exchange of the project or US$15.00 million
equivalent will be financed by IDA. The local cost or US$7.25 million
equivalent will be financed by the Government.

3.16       The project will be divided into nine civil work contract packages,
five of which (representing about 86 percent of the total civil works) will be
tendered following International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures in
accordance with IDA procurement guidelines. ICB contract packages will be
advertised as one tender to enable interested bidders to make offers on a
slice-and-package basis, allowing them to offer discounts should they be
awarded more than one slice of the package. The four civil work contract
packages that will be tendered under Local Competitive Bidding (LCB)
procedures acceptable to IDA, consist of small works scattered over the
project area; these works will be more attractive to local contractors. All
civil works contracts will be implemented over periods of less than two years
from the date of opening tenders and will be on fixed price basis. Documents
and awards for all contracts under ICB and the first contract under LCB will
be subject to prior review by IDA. Other contracts will be subject to
selective post-award reviews. One set of sample bidding documents to be used
for procurement through LCB will be submitted for IDA's prior clearance. Due
to limited capacity of local civil works contractors, it is anticipated that
only LCB contracts would be awarded to local contractors. Consultants for IDA

financed services would be selected and appointed in accordance with the
August 1981 'Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and
by the World Bank as Executing Agency. The components to be procured under
ICB and LCB are as follow:

procedures; and contracts costing less than US$100,000 equivalent per contract
and not more than US$1.00 million equivalent in aggregate, would be procured
based on comparing at least three price quotations from at least two countries
through International Shopping procedures in accordance with IDA guidelines.
Documents for all contracts expected to cost more than US$100,000 would be

3.19        Bank/IDA profiles show that disbursements for urban projects in
the EMENA region extend over a period of eight years; however, in YAR the
average disbursement period for all sectors is nine years. The implementation
period for this project (Annex 3) is estimated at eight years (July 1990 -
June 1998) based on the relative simplicity of the works and the well advanced
stage of the tender documents (tendering is scheduled to start in July 1990).
The credit is expected to be fully disbursed six months after project
completion, hence the closing date of the proposed credit will be December 31,
1998. This disbursement schedule takes into account a 20 percent advance
payment on all civil works and an initial deposit of US$1 million in a Special
Account (Table 3.5).
3.20        In order to expedite disbursements, a Special Account will be
opened in the Central Bank of Yemen to which IDA will make an initial deposit
of US$1.0 million. The Special Account will be replenished against withdrawal
applications of at least US$100.000 equivalent at monthly intervals or, as
appropriate, when the undisbursed balance of the Account is equal to 50
percent or less than the amount of the initial deposit.   All disbursements
under the project will be made against standard documentation, except for
contracts below US$ 50,000 equivalent which will be claimed under Statements
of Expenditures (SOE) for which related documentation will be retained for
review by IDA missions and audited by independent auditors acceptable to the
Association (para.4.20 and 4.21). During negotiations, agreement was reached
that a Special Account will be opened at the Central Bank of Yemen.

Project Supervision
3.22        Normally, two supervision missions per year of a municipal
engineer, and one supervision mission per year of a financial analyst, each of
1-1/2 weeks duration, will be sufficient to supervise the project. In the
first year, however, four staff-weeks of a municipal engineer will be required
to review procurement aspects of the project. In the second year, _wo staff-
weeks of an expert on natural disaster prevention will also be required. A
detailed project supervision forecast is given in Annex 4. On the basis of
this forecast and on an average cost of US$ 5,000 per staff member per mission
(for combined missions), the total IDA cost of supervision missions for the
project will be about US$ 130,000.
Monitoring System
3.23        During negotiations, agreement was reached on the Project
'Implementation Programme and Monitoring Indicators (Annex 5). To monitor this
program and other aspects of project implementation, quarters.; progress
reports will be submitted to IDA. Agreement was also reached during
negotiations that MMH will submit to IDA quarterly reports commencing in the
last period of 1990.
3.24        During negotiations assurances were obtained that MMH will
prepare, within six months following the closing date of the Credit, and
slubmit to the Association a project completion report reviewing the planned
objectives of the project, including costs and benefits derived, performance
and contribution of all the parties associated with the project.
Laud Acquisition
3.25        The project will be built within public rights-of-way.  However,
seven houses built within or along wadi courses will be expropriated. Three
out of the seven houses to be expropriated are squatter homes built on or
along wadi courses. To address the problem of relocating squatter families,
the Government has proposed to house them in government owned buildings in the
project area giving them home ownership rights. Regarding the remaining
houses which also are within wadi courses, the Government intends to purchase
them at the current market value. These houses to be acquired are not of
historical value and some of them will only entail demolishing courtyard walls
to provide sufficient right-of-way for the proposed flood control works.
During negotiations, agreement was obtained that arrangements satisfactory to
IDA on the relocation of squatter families and on the purchase of homes will
be finalized by December 31, 1990.

IV. THE BORROWE  AND IMPLM ING AGENCY
The Borrower
4.01        The proposed Credit of SDR 11.7 million equivalent will be made to
the Government of the Yemen Arab Republic. MIBH through its Housing
Directorate will have prime responsibility for the implementation of all
components.
Organization and Management - MII
4.02        MM employs a total staff of about 3,800 people, of which about
1,200 work at headquarters while the remaining 2,600 work at the branch level.
About 300 employees are graduate engineers, 330 are technical staff, and 915
are administrative personnel; the remaining 2,255 are unskilled workers such
as drivers, laborers and garbage collectors (Annex 8).
4.03        At the national level, MMH is divided into six functional
departments, each headed by a Director General, but grouped under two
Assistant Deputy Ministers (Annex 6). The Departments of Physical Planning
(PPD), Projects (PD) and Urban Development and Housing (UDHD) report to the
Assistant Deputy Minister for Technical Affairs; the Departments of
Slaughterhouses and Meat Markets (SMMD), Environmental Health (EHD), and
Finance and Administration (FAD) report to the Assistant Deputy Minister for
Finance and Administration.
4.04        The Physical Planning Department (PPD) is the central unit of the
A1 'litry and is responsible for the preparation of master plans and for the
I iudnce of building permits. Although it has a comparatively larger
technical staff than the othar departments, there is a serious shortage of
middle-level technicians in PPD; other problems also exist including a lack of
up-to-date planning information (e.g., socio-economic, demographic, and
geographic data), equipment and budgetary resources. The Department has yet
to develop a national urban policy framework and, therefore, lacks an overall
strategy for settlement planning.
4.05        The Projects or "Publfc Works" Department (PD) under the Housing
Directorate is responsible for the paving and maintenance of urban roads,
street lighting, and tne design and construction of central markets, public
gardens and parks. It also plays a role in the construction of public baths
and toilets and provides design services to other government agencies on
request.
4.06        The Urban Development and Housing Department (UDHD) under the
Housing Directorate is responsible for the development of goals, objectives
and strategies for national urbanization &nd housing programs. Its mandate
includes the collection and collating of planning information and data with a
view to determining the prospective resources that could be mobilized for both
urban development and housing initiatives. UDHD is also responsible for



- 19 -
implementing the two earlier IDA financed projects and will be responsible for
implementing the proposed project.
4.07        The Environmental Health Department (EHD) is responsible for urban
environmental management throughout the country, although its activities are
primarily restricted to garbage collection and disposal. Only the cities of
Sana'a, Taiz, Hodeida and Dhamar have regular collection service.  Tke-
Department also functions as the Secretariat of the National Environmental
Council. EHD, with the assistance of an environmental expert financed under a
grant provided by the Government of the Netherlands, is developing a national
environmental policy. The Slaughterhouses and Meat Market Department (SMMD)
is responsible for all publicly-owned abattoirs and meat markets, while the
Finance and Administration Department (FAD) is responsible for all accounting
and personnel matters.
Organization and Management - TBO
4.08        BO is the local operating arm of the Ministry for both the city
of Taiz and the surrounding smaller cities and rural areas in the Taiz
Governorate. TBO is divided into two functional units--Administration and
Finance and Municipal Operations--each headed by a Director reporting to the
General Director (see Annex 7 for the organizational chart).
4.09        The Administration and Finance Unit is further divided inco three
divisions; accounting, personnel and commercial activities. The Accounting
Division is headed by a chief accountant supported by four assistants, while
the Personnel Division is headed by a chief personnel officer supported by
five assistants. The Commercial Division, comprising one person, is
responsible for issuing commercial permits and all revenue collection.
4.10        The Municipal Services Unit is divided into four Divisions --
Technical, Solid Waste Management, Environment, and Security. The Technical
Division has sections for planning, projects, building permits, inspection,
utilities, and survey. The Solid Waste Management Division, established in
1981 with the assistance of the Government of the Netherlands, is divided into
four main sections: administration, stores, collection and workshop. The
collection section is subdivided into seven work groups, each haaded by an
inspector/foreman and wit}. about 25-35 cleaners. About 100 tons of refuse are
collected and disposed of daily. The Environment Division is staffed with six
health inspectors responsible for inspecting shops, restaurants and street
cleaning; they also coordinate their activities with health centers. The
Security Division is staffed with eight police officers and is primarily
responsible for enforcing municipal regulations.
Staffing and Training
4.11        At the natioral level, the Physical Planning Degartment (which
forms the core of ministerial activities), is in need of specialized training
to enhance its effecLiveness. In this connection, the Ministry has received a
technical assistance grant from the Government of the Federal Republic of
Germany through Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ).



- 20 -
The grant is financing a team of German experts who are in residence at the
Ministry and whose function is to strengthen its physical planning capacity.
While the initiative has met thus far with mixed success, GTZ intends to
continue its program for at least another two years. The physical plans being
developed, however, lack a focus on aspects related to preventing and
mitigating natural disasters (such as floods and landslides) through
appropriate urban development and planning policies. To strengthen this
program, IDA will finance an advisor to the Physical Planning Department on
natural disaster mitigation and early warning systems (Arnaex 6), who will (a)
review and improve the physical plans and urban development policies for the
major urban centers; (b) recommend necessary early warning systems; and (c)
assist MMH in establishing and organizing a Disaster Preparedness and Relief
Unit to coordinate MMH's activities with those of the National Committee for
Natural Disaster Mitigation and Emergency Relief (NCNDMER), as well as with
those of other ministries.
4.12        In terms of both operational and policy making capability, the
effectiveness of the Urban Development and Housing Department (UDHD) of the
Housing Directorate has been mixed. Since its inception, it has concentrated
almost exclusively on implementing the first two IDA-financed urban projects;
few initiatives have been undertaken on broader policy matters. The growing
population and the rapid rate of urbanization are becoming pressing problems
that require immediate attention. The scattered and isolated settlements must
be linked with the urban areas to provide them with basic infrastructure and
services. Above all, it is necessary to establish the appropriate training
programs in order to develop the needed manpower so that the municipalities
can discharge their mandates more efficiently. IDA will finance technical
assistance on housing and urban development policy, to formulate and assist in
the implementation of the above programs (Annex 6).
4.13        There is a need to develop a design and a materials testing and
research sections within the Pro3ects Department (PD) this could also be
enhanced by strengthening the field survey capabilty. IDA will finance
technical assistance of a pu]Lic works engineering advisor for strengthening
this capability (Annex 6).
4.14        At the MuniciRal Brpch Offi__e level, operational management
practices are in need of strengthening, especially in view of the rapid
population growth of the three main cities and the increasing demand for urban
services. In this connection, the proposed project will finance technical
assistance, comprising municipal engineering and urban planning to assist the
PD in improving urban service delivery capability. The technical experts will
focus their efforts of its branch offices on Sana'a, Taiz and Hodeidah, and
the improvements they will develop ultimately could be replicated on a
national basis.
4.15        During negotiations, agreement was reached on the selection and
hiring of the technical assistance advisors in accordance with the Project
Implementation Program (Annex 5). Terms of reference for technical assistance
are available in the project file (Annex 14).



- 21 -
Project Implementation and Management
4.16        At the central level, overall project management will be handled
by the Urban Development and Housing Department (Annex 6). In order to
provide the requisite expertise in procurement and implementation matters, and
to assist the Department on strengthening its urban development capabilities
of expatriate assistance will be financed by the proposed project. The role
of the expatriate expert will be that of an advisor, and the emphasis will be
on training the Yemeni counterparts in overall project management and urban
development.
4.17        A construction supervision team will be established in Taiz, but
will report to the Urban Development and Housing Department at Ministry
headquarters (para. 4.16). The team will comprise a Project Manager (Yemeni
engineer) assisted by an advisor (expatriate construction engineer) with
"hands on' experience in drainage and flood control construction activities
(para. 4.19). Under this arrangement, two Deputy Project Managers (Yemeni
engineers) will also be appointed. These Yemeni enginteers have been actively
involved in the project design and are well qualified to undertake this
responsibility.
4.18        In order to ensure that the project is not delayed due to lack of
counterpart funds, t1,e Borrower, by October 30 of each year will furnish IDA
MMH's proposed budgetary allocations for carrying out the annual work
programs, and by December 31 of each year, furnish IDA approved budgets for
the implementation of the proposed project.
4.19        Project management consisting of an expatriate construction
engineer, project management expenditures and salary supplements to the Yemeni
counterparts will be financed by the project.V By the time construction
activity peaks, there will be an additional 12 field inspectors whose salaries
and living costs will be financed from the Ministry budget. During
negotiations, agreement was reached on the appointment of the construction
management staff by December 31, 1990.
Project Accounts am' Audits
4.20        Accounting standards within MMH are not suited to the financial
monitoring of projects. To remedy this, MMH has kept separate accounts of all
project-related financial transactions for IDA financed projects. These
accounts are kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The personnel working in the accounting unit are competent. The project
accounts will also include all operations related to the proposed Special
Account (para. 3.20). During negotiations, agreement was reached, that MMH
g For purposes of salary supplements, the following positions are considered
eligible: a project manager and a deputy project manager at headquarters,
and a field project manager and two field deputy project managers, an
accountant and independent auditors.



- 22 -
will continue to keep separate project accounts, including all operations
related to the Special Account.
4.21        During negotiations, agreement was also reached that the project
accounts will continue to be audited annually by an independent auditor
satisfactory to IDA, and that the project accounts inclutding the auditor's
opinion will be submitted to IDA not later than nine moalths after the close of
each fiscal year. Funds have been provided in the project to finance the cost
of such audits.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND COST RECOVERY
The Ministry of Municipalities and Housing
5.01        All capital projects, including maintenance activities, are
centrally prepared and approved. While the budgets for recurrent expenditures
are prepared locally, they too are approved at the central level. As shown in
Table 5.1 below (an extract from Annex 9), during the past two years total
budget expenditures of the Ministry almost doubled, increasing from YR 223
million in 1987 to YR 437 million in 1989. Of these amounts, salaries and
wages and project expenditures accounted for 36 percent and 47 percent,
respectively, of total expenditures, leaving only 17 percent of budgetary
resources for administration, operations and maintenance.

Note: Years end December 31.
The Taiz Branch Office
5.02        TBO (as is the case with all branch offices) is empowered to raise
revenue through a variety of mechanisms, notably permits, licenses, fines,
penalties and the rental of publ'.cly-owned buildings. As shown in Table 5.2
below (an extract from Annex 10), these revenues increased by an average of
about 10 percent, from YR 10.5 million in 1987 to YR 11.4 million in 1989.
However, recurrent expenditures increased even faster, rising from YR 9.2
million in 1987 to YR 21.8 million in 1989. Thus, from a budget surplus of YR
1.4 million in 1987, the situation quickly deteriorated to a budget deficit of
YR 10.4 million by 1989. The cause of the budget deficit can be largely
attributed to rapidly escalating payroll costs. There is clearly an urgent
need to improving the efficiency of operations and to increase resource
mobilization at the local level.

Project Cost Recovery
5.03        Given the financial constraints at the macro level, it was agreed
during appraisal that the proposed project will comprise only the essential
investments--all others will be deferred until additional resources become
available. Based on this agreement, the total project costs, comprising
essential flood control works, expropriation costs, maintenance equipment,
project administration, technical assistance and training, is estimated at YR
267.0 million, including all contingencies. It is this amount which will be
recovered (Annex 12).
5.04        It was also agreed during appraisal that actual cost recovery
will commence in January 1996 after most of the investments are implemented.
It was further agreed that for the purpose of matching average monthly
payments against generally accepted affordability criteria, a 20-year payback
period was considered appropriate. In view of the opportunity cost associated
with the project, it was agreed that at least part of this cost will be
recovered through a 10 percent carrying charge.
5.05        Based on the foregoing, the total aggregate monthly pay back
amount, for the project as a whole, is estimated at YR 2.71 million (para 6 of
Annex 12). It is noteworthy that a 30-year pay back period was also
considered but was discounted because the average monthly pay back would be
reduced by only 10 percent, thus resulting in no significant positive impact
on affordability.
5.06         An analysis was also undertaken to measure the impact on the
monthly charges if costs were recovered on a citywide basis rather than on a
project area basis. The number of beneficiaries by category is shown in Table
5.3 below.

Total Beneficiaries                   5,665             35.260
5.07        On a pre4oct area basis, and assuming that all costs would be
recovered equally from each beneficiary within the project area, the average
monthly charge would be YR 477 per month. This figure would drop to YR 77 per
month if costs are recovered on a citywide basis, thus demonstrating that the
project is affordable only if the larger beneficiary base is used (para. 9 of
Annex 12).
5.08        Moreover, the foregoing has been computed on the basis of a flat
rate tariff. Such a mechanism does not take into account the income
disparities between various households. A much preferred methodology is a
differential pricing mechanism, where the higher income groups and the
commercial and industrial users pay a higher proportion of the costs. The
difficulty in differential pricing, however, is to find an administratively
simple way of determining the real capacity to pay of each household. A
widely used mechanism is to accept the average electricity bill for each of
the above categories (which is highly income elastic) as a proxy for
determining real capacity to pay. This mechanism was discussed during
appraisal and an agreement in principle was obtained from MMH.
5.09        The above-mentioned agreements with MMH on a project cost recovery
mechanism were approved by the Cabinet as confirmed by a telex from CPO dated
February 28, 1990. However, confirmation was obtained during negotiations on
the following project cost recovery mechanism: (i) the total project cost will
be recovered over a 20-year period at an annual interest rate of 10 percent;
(ii) a differential pricing mechanism satisfactory to IDA, will be introduced
by January 1, 1996 to recover the project cost and that the city as a whole be
used as the basis for this cost recovery; and (iii) the billing and collection
mechanism will be as recommended under the ongoing municipal resource
mobilization study (para. 5.10).
5.10        A national municipal resource mobilization study being carried out
by consultants (IPA) under Credit 1441-YAR is scheduled for completion in
September 1990; on the basis of this study, MMH will draft a national policy
for municipal resource mobilization. During project appraisal, MMH agreed to
an Action Plan for the drafting and implementation of such a policy (Annex



- 26 -
13).  Agreement was obtained during negotiations that (a) by  May 31, 1991 MH
will submit for IDA's review a draft of such a policy which should include a
billing and collection mechanism; (b) by January 31, 1992, MMH will seek
Cabinet's approval of such a policy; and (c) by September 30, 1992 MMH will
seek Parliament's approval of such a policy.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Least Cost Alternative
6.01        The proposed project is the least-cost solution in terms of
yielding maximum benefits and yet providing adequate safeguards for the
protection of both human life and property (para.3.04-3.07, 6.03-6.04).
Prolect Benefits
6.02        The main benefits attributed to the proposed project relate
largely to the removal of the risk of flood related losses on: (a) damages to
public and private buildings, missing building contents, and damaged vehicles;
(b) damages to public infrastructure such as roads, water and sewerage,
electricity and telephone; (c) disruptions to traffic and business; (d)
expenditures for removing alluvial material and garbage from streets; and (e)
human life. Other benefits include land reclamation and road access
improvements along wadis. Benefits that could not be quantified include a
lower incidence of personal accidents during floods; the avoidance of
fractured and obstructed sewers causing nuisance and health hazards; and the
avoidance of interrupting access to the main hospital. The annual economic
benefits are estimated at about YR 32.8 million (or about US$2.7 million
equivalent); property damage is the single largest benefit item representing
about 80 percent of all benefits.
Ecgnoqig Analysis
6.03        A summary of project costs and benefits arising from the proposed
project is given in Annex 11. Project costs include the investment (in
constant prices) of YR 205.0 million (implemented over a period of eight years
starting in 1991) plus an annual recurrent cost of YR 0.4 million starting in
1999 for a period of 37 years (through 2035). Project benefits (in constant
prices) were estimated based on the avoidance of flood related damages and
land enhancement arising from the proposed drainage improvements (para. 6.02).
These flood related dAmages were estimated by the consultant based on a survey
conducted during project preparation which provided the necessary information
on losses to the private sector (transport, property and stock damage) and to
the public sector (infrastructure repairs and cleanup costs). About 90
percent of the benefits were assumed to commence in 1997 when most of the
flood control works would be completed. The present value of costs and
benefits, based on a 45-year project life (1991-2035) and a 10 percent annual
discount rate (which is considered the opportunity cost of capital), are



- 27 -
estimated at YR 153.9 million and YR 184.4 million respectively. A net
present value is thus estimated at YR 30.5 million; the benefit/cost ratio is
estimated at 1.20.
6.04        The economic rate of return (ERR), based on a project life of 45
years, is estimated at 12 percent. A sensitivity analysis for various cost
and benefit zcenarios gives the following results:
(i)   a 0 percent increase in cost and a 20 percent decrease in
benefits yields an ERR of 10 percent;
(ii)  a 10 percent increase in cost and a 0 percent decrease in
benefits yields an ERR of 11 percent; and
(iii) a 10 percent increase in cost and a 20 percent decrease in
benefits yields an ERR of 9 percent.
6.05        An analysis of switching values, based on a 10 percent annual
discount rate, shows that a zero net present value is obtained when costs
increase by 20 percent, or when benefits decrease by 20 percent, or when
property damage (the single largest benefit item) decreases by '2 percent.
Affordability and Urban Poverty
6.06        Two scenarios of affordability were analyzed, namely, recovering
the cost (i) on a citywide basis; and (Li) on a project area basis
(para.5.06). The monthly charges for each beneficiary were estimated at about
YR 77 citywide, and YR 477 in the project area, respectively (para.5.07).
Based on the minimum household income of YR 3000 per month, which is
considered the poverty threshold, the cost recovery charges for each of these
two scenarios would represent about 2.6 percent and 15.9 percent of the
minimum household income, respectively. This analysis shows that cost
recovery is affordable only if implemented on a citywide basis. Furthermore,
if differential price mechanism were used, the average monthly charge per
household would be about YR 45, while low income households would pay as low
as YR 20 monthly, or less than one percent of the minimum household income,
which is affordable (Annex 12).
6.07        The affordability survey conducted by the consultant during
project preparation shows that of the 5,134 households in the project area,
about 15 percent or 770 households are living below the poverty threshold, and
an equal number of families are also considered to be of low income, i.e.
within a 10% range of the poverty threshold. Furthermore, the souk (market
place), which is a beehive of commercial activity and an important tourist
attraction, provides substantial employment to low income families and may be
their sole source of income. These households and small-scale businesses are
generally the most affected by floods and often suffer considerable economic
losses through property damage and missing stock.   The proposed project would
provide protection against floods in this area, thus greatly reducing such
losses.



- 28 -
Institution Building
6.08        The proposed project will strengthen the institutional capability
of MMH and its main branch offices through the provision of technical
assistance and training. The technical assistance to PD, PPD and UDHD on
municipal public works, urban development and housing policy, will pr-avide MMH
with the necessary technical capability on design and the development of
standards and policies for nationwide use. Also, the technical assistance on
municipal engineering and olanning will strengthen the local municipal branch
offices and enhance their effectiveness by introducing a professional
discipline in city management. Sana'a, Taiz and Hodeidah will be the first
experimental program; any institutional gains made there could then be
replicated in the remaining cities.
Environmental Impact
6.09        The proposed project will yield major environmental improvements
by collecting refuse material, sand, gravel and boulders in sediment traps.
City streets will be cleaner and more sanitary; sewage overflows will be
avoided; damage to private and public property will be mitigated; and the risk
of loss of human life will be greatly reduced (para.3.05). The project will
also provide assistance to MMH for addressing natural disaster prevention
(including provision of early warning systems) through appropriate planning
and development policies (para. 4.11). No historical buildings will be
affected by the proposed project (para. 3.25).
Project Risks and IDA Supervision
6.10        Two types of construction risks are foreseen, one related to the
normal construction of civil works and the other associated with floods that
could damage structures under construction and further aggravate the dangers
normally posed by such calamities. Both types of risks, however, will be
minimized through strict construction requirements included in the tender
specifications, and by qualified supervision. The flood control structures
have been designed with temporary provisions for use during construction. Two
IDA supervision missions per year will be scheduled to ensure that the project
implementation proceeds on schedule, and that qualified construction
supervision is provided.
Land Requirements and Resettlement
6.11        The project will be built in public rights-of-way.  However, seven
houses located on or along wadis will be expropriated to provide rights-of-
way for some sections of the proposed project. Three of these houses are
squatter homes of poor construction. The Government will relocate these
families in government owned buildings in the Old Taiz area; they will be
provided with



29 -
property titles. The remaining houses will be purchased by the Government at
market prices (para. 3.25). No resettlement of affected populations will be
required.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMENDATIONS
7.01        During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on:
(i)   the opening of a Special Account at the Central Bank of
Yemen (para 3.20);
(ii)  the Project Implementation Program (para. 3.23); the
submission of quarterly progress reports (para. 3.23); and
the submission of a project completion report six months
after project completion (para 3.24);
(iii) the acquisition of land and the relocation of families in a
manner satisfactory to IDA (para 3.25);
(iv)  the selection and hiring of technical advisors (para 4.15);
the submittal to IDA by October 30 of each year MMH's
proposed budgetary allocations for the project (para. 4.18);
and the appointment of the project implementation and
management staff (para 4.19);
(v)   the continuation of separate project,accounts (para. 4.20);
and the submission of annual audits of,project accounts to
IDA not later than nine months after the close of each
fiscal year (para 4.27);
(vi)  the implementation of project cost recovery (para. 5.09);
and
(vii) the implementation of a national policy for municipal
resource mobilization (para 5.10).

III through V of this report and summarized in para 7.01 above, the proposed
project is suitable for an IDA credit of SDRs 11.7 million equivalent to the
Government of YAR under standard IDA terms with a 40-year maturity including a
10-year grace period.

ECONOM1C ANALYSIS
The Criteria
1.          The following criteria were used in the economic analysis:
(i)  the net present value and the economic rate of return are based
on annual mean values;
(ii) all benefit component data was, except for the flood damage
to properties, obtained directly as annual values;
(iii) all benefits accrued to property damage were based on the mean
annual benefit obtained from a loss -probability curve (obtained
from the FHRC computer model developed by the Flood Hazard
Research Center of Middlesex Polytechnic, UK);
(iv) the scheme life was takan to be 45 years (1991-2035), the
discount rate 10, and the flood frequency of 1:20 years;
(v)   sensitivity analysis were carried out to determine the effect
of project cost increases and benefits decreases, and switching
values calculated for project cost, total benefits anJ the
overwhelming property damage benefit;
(vi) the benefits are phased through the last two years of capital
expenditure in proportion to the accumulated expenditure in
previous years, commencing in 1997;
(vii)  a factor of 0.7175 was used where acquired benefit data
included subsequent phases of flood control works; and
(viii) the 20 year flood affects 401 more properties than the 10 year
flood.
the Benefits
2.          ProRertv Damage.  The results of the Household and Flood survey
carried out in Taiz, provided data on the frequency and damage sustained by
properties in part of the project area. The extrapolation of numbers affected
to the whole area; it was based on estimates developed by MMH and the consultant
engineer (Halerow Fox Eng.). Mean values have been used for reported damage per

Page 2 of 5
flood event, differentiating between shops and other properties, and the "Old
Town" and elsewhere.   The flood data enabled identifying four flood event
frequencies to develop a reasonable loss-probability curve. These flood events
were categorized as follows:
Flood
Freauenv   Extent of Damage
1/3 year    no significant damage
2 year      moderate damage
10 year     extensive damage
20 year     major damage
3.          The use of a loss-probability curve has enabled the inclusion of
benefits resulting from the lower impact of flood events more severe than the
1:20 year flood frequency design period.
4.          Road Surface. Sewer Regairs and Sediment Clearing.  The proportion
of the annual expenditure incurred in the project area attributable to flooding
was obtained from the Taiz Branch Office (TBO).
5.          Parked Cars.  It was reported by the TBO that the 1 in 10 year flood
event causes material damage to about 10 cars, with the extent of damage between
minor and total write-off. This was interpreted to a mean annual damage to one
car amounting to 50X of its value (YR 75,000).
6.          Road Traffic.  This cost was based on taxi fares, fuel and time
benefits calculated on behalf of TBO as a result of the road improvements
inherent in the phase I works.
7.          Land Enhancement.  The net enhancement value for the area along Wadi
1 was estimated at YR 13.59 million and included as a single benefit in 1998.

8.          Other Unauantified Benefits.   The following benefits were not
included as they could not be quantified:
(i)   lower incidence of personal accidents during flood events and
generally as a result of improved roads and pedestrian areas;

Page 3 of 5
(ii)  reduced levels of worry snd strees in the community;
(iii) improved standards of environmental health, fewer fractured
and obstructed sewers causing nuissance and health hazards;
(iv)  improved access to upper reaches of wadies will result in a
higher standard of street cleanliness and refuse collection;
(v)    less damage, if any, to water, telephone and electricity
supplies;
(vi) access routes to the main hospital will not be cut-off for the
duration of flood events; and
(vii) street market disruption will be avoided several times each
year.
-the Cost,
9.          The project cost includes the investment cost of all components and
the annual maintenance cost (from 1998 to 2035) based on constant prices, that
is, excluding price contingencies. The following annual disbursements in YR
millions were used:
Year  1291 12  1221  1224  l99S  1224  1997  1228  1299..23
Costs 12.00 43.25 35.36 41.99 36.57 20.52 10.26 5.05 0.40 0.40
AnalYsis Results.
10.         The results of the economic analysis are summarized below:
(i)   Table 1 shows a net present value of YR 30.4 million, with
an economic rate of return for the project of 12X, and a
benefit/cost ratio of 1.20;
(ii)  exclusion of the Wadi 1 land enhancement from the benefits
results in a NPV of YR 24.1 million, an ERR of 122 and a
B/C ratio of 1.15;
(iii) the land enhancement benefit is clearly not a critical economic
component;
(iv)  an analysis of switching values based on a 10  discount rate
shows that a zero NPV is obtained if (a) costs increase by 20Z,
or (b) benefits are reduced by 20X, or (c) property damage,
the single largest benefit item, decreases by 222; and
(v)   under a plausible scenario of 102 increase of project costs
and a 201 decrease in benefits the NPV (based on a 102 disco-unt
rate) of YR -21.8 million, and an ERR of 92 were obtained.

YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
TAIZ FLOOD DISASTER PREVENTION AND MUNICIPAL
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
AFFORDABILITY ANALYSIS
1.          Introduction.  IDA project appraisal mission together with MKH's
staff developed the following criteria for the analysis of the project cost
recovery. For the purposes of this presentation, the analysis has been divided
into four parts, namely:
Part A- project cost estimates and recovery alternatives;
Part B- cost recovery criteria and monthly payback calculations;
Part C- number of beneficiaries and average monthly charges; and
Part D- billing and collection mechanisms.
Part A - Project Cost Estimates and Recovery Alternatives
2.          Given the financial constraints at the macro level, it was agreed
that the proposed project would comprise only of essential flood protection
investments--all others would be deferred until additional resources became
available.   Based on this agreement,  the total project costs,  comprising
essential flood control works; expropriation costs; maintenance equipment;
project administration; technical assistance; and training, is estimated at YR
280.80 million including contingencies.
3.          Discussions were held with MMH officials as to the proportion of
total costs that should be recovered. The following table presents four cost
recovery alternatives, which range from recovery of total project costs (YR280.80
million) to recovery of only the cost for essential flood control works (YR229.92
million).

Part B- Cost Recovery Criteria and Monthly Payback Calculations
4.          It was agreed that cost recovery should not be introduced until after
the investments have been implemented. This means that a five-year grace period
(1991-95) would be appropriate, with actual cost recovery commencing in 1996.
It was further agreed that for the purposes of matching average monthly payments
against generally accepted affordability criteria, a 20-year pay back period
would be appropriate. It is noteworthy that a 30-year payback period was also
considered, but was discounted because the average monthly payment would be
reduced only by about 10 X, thus resulting in no significant positive impact on
affordabilty.
5.          Given also that there are competing demands at the national level
for relatively scarce investment resources, there is an opportunity cost to this
project. It is considered essential that at least part of this opportunity cost
should be recovered. Therefore, a 10 carrying charge has been introduced (the
carrying charge in the two earlier urban projects was 11).
6.          Based on the foregoing criteria, the following table shows the total
monthly pay back amount over 20 and 30 years respectively (including monthly
maintenance costs of YR 20,000):
Pay Back Period
20 Years       30 Years
Alternative A YR      2,705,151      2,464,073
Alternative B YR      2,625,768      2,391,765
Alternative C YR      2,432,324      2,215,562
Alternative D YR      2,214,987      2,017,591
Part C - Number of Beneficiaries and Average Monthly Charges
7.          The project has significant benefits not only for the project area
but also for the city as a whole.   For example, the project will improve
vehicular traffic originating (and destined) to points outside the project area.
Similarly, many workers living outside the project area do work inside the area,
The project also reduces the risk to human life caused by the frequent flash
floods.
8.          An analysis, therefore, has been undertaken to measure the impact
on the monthly charges if costs were recovered on a citywide basis rather than
a project area basis. The following table shows the number of beneficiaries in
the project area and in the city as a whole:

Shops                                      500              8,119
Workshops                                   30                898
Industries                                   l                  8
Total Beneficiaries                   5,665             35,260
9.          Based on the foregoing, and assuming that all costs would be
recovered equally from each beneficiary, the average monthly charge would be as
follows:
Average Monthly Charge
Proiect Area    Citywide Basis
20 Yeaxs  30 Years  20 Years  30Years
Alternative A                  477      434        77         69
Alternative B                  446      407        71         65
Alternative C                  424      386        68         72
Alternative D                  384      350        62         56
10.         As can be seen from the foregoing, the average monthly charge would
be unaffordable if total project costs were recovered only from the project area.
In fact, the project is only affordable if costs are recovered on a citywide
basis.
11.         Moreover, the foregoing has been computed on the basis of a flat rate
tariff. Such a mechanism does not take into consideration the income disparities
between the various households. A much preferred methodology is a differential
pricing mechanism, where the higher income groups and the commercial and
industrial beneficiaries pay a higher proportion of the costs.
12.         The difficulty in differential pricing, however,  is to find an
administratively simple way of determining the real capacity to pay of each
househoid. One such mechanism used widely in other countries is to accept the
average electricity bill for each of the above categories (which is highly income
elastic) as a proxy for determining real capacity to pay.
13.         The following table shows a profile of Taiz electricity billings as
at October 1989 by category and by number of consumers, together with the average
monthly bill for each category of consumer.

14.         Using a recovery factor of 40X of the average monthly electricity
bill for households, shops and workshops respectively,. and 4 X for industries,
the following table shows the average monthly charges which result in a total
amount recovered of YR 1,919,769. This amount is more or less representative
of the total project costs outlined in any of the above alternatives.   The
advantage of differential pricing is that a typical lower income beneficiary
having for example a monthly electricity bill of YR 50, would pay as little as
YR 20 per month, while a higher income beneficiary would pay proportionately much
more.

Part D - Billing and Collection Mechanisms
15.         There are three potential billing and collection mechanisms, notably:
(i)   the national electricity authority (YGEC);
(ii) the National Water Authority (NWSA); and
(iii) the MMH itself.
16.         The preferred mechanism is the YGEC for three main reasons. First,
it has the most extensive service coverage in Taiz; second, it provides an
administratively simple basis for improving the income distribution potential
of the project; and third, since there is already an administrative system for
billing and collection, the added administrative cost will be marginal.
