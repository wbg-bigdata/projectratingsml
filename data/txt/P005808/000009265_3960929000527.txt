MWORANUMM AND RECOMHENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
QF HE n IERNATIONAL DEVELOPM1NT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A  OPOSED CREDIT
TO THE YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
FOR THE TAIZ FLOOD DISASTER PREVENTION
AND MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) for SDR 11.7 million (US$ 15 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard
IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would finance the foreign exchange cost of
the Taiz Flood Disaster Prevention and Municipal Development Project.
2.   Backgrou.  Urbanization in the Yemen Arab Republic started rapidly in
the early 1970s after the national reconciliation, which was chaLacterized by
a period of economic boom. The principal causes of this rapid urbanization are:
(i) the high rate of increase in personal incomes; (ii) stagnation of
agriculture; and (iii) the relative growth of government services.   These
urbanization trends are likely to continue, though moderately, given the economic
situation prevailing in the Gulf countries, which has resulted in a reversal of
migrant workers. Urbanization ilk YAR is among the lowest, as it representF only
16 percent of the total population .f about 9.3 million (1986 census', but
fastest growing throughout the Middle East.   The urban population is quite
widespread with a moderate concentration in the three largest cities. The 1986
populations of Sana'a, the capital, Taiz, the principal trading and agricultural
processing center, and Hodeidah, YAR's main port, were about 430,000, 180,000,
and 150,000, respectively (about 60 percent of the urban population).   The
remaining 40 percent of the urban population reside in secondary towns of less
than 50,000 inhabitants. The populations of Sana'a and Taiz,on the other hand,
have more than doubled in the past five years, growing at a rate of about 15
percent per annum.
3.    As personal incomes and urban population increased in the 1970s and early
1980s, so did the uncontrolled sprawl of informal (but fairly well built) housing
on to urban areas. However,the provision of urban services lagged behind, despite
the Government's impressive efforts. Contributing factors to the growth in urban
service deficiencies have been the absence of a formal land registration system,
failure to fully recover the cost of services thereby eroding the Government's
capacity to finance such services, and the use of unrealistic standards
unaffordable to a large segment of the population.
4.    Concerned with the mounting urban problems and the lack of coordination
of the activities of the various ministries and agencies, the Government, in
1979, vested to the newly established Ministry of Municipalities and Housing
(MMH) the responsibility for the physical planning and urban administration of
the five main cities and of the secondary towns, while the Central Planning
Organization (CPO) was charged with ensuring that the national urban development
policy would be consistent with the broader national development strategies.
The Government's strategy in the urban sector, therefore, focuses on providing
essential municipal infrastructure while strengthening the institutional



- 2 -
capabilities at the central and local levels. In Taiz, however, the provision
of municipal infrastructure has been hampered by the recurrent floods in the Old
Taiz area, wlhich cause: damage to private and public buildings and municipal
infrastructure, disruption to traffic and business; hazard to human health; and
risk to human life. In view of the foregoing, the Government's priority in Taiz
is that of addressing the problems posed by recurrent floods.
5.    Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Given YAR's current difficult economic
situation and the mounting pressure of its urban problems, IDA's strategy in the
sector is focused on well targeted project work requiring minimum and directly
recoverable investment with maximum use of existing resources. This project work
is aimed at enhancing IDA dialogue with the Yemeni authorities while at the same
time serving as a vehicle for addressing institutional and structural weaknesses
(urban infrastructure maintenance, municipal resource mobilization and cost
recovery) by building on the achievements already obtained from the first two
ongoing urban development projects.   The main lessons learned from these
operations are that (i) sufficient time should be allowed for physical project
implementation, and (ii) appropriate compensation should be offered to attract
and retain qualified local personnel. These lessons have been taken into account
in the design of the proposed project.
6.    In the urban sector, IDA's strategy is to prepare the groundwork for
broader policy oriented sectoral involvement and to set the stage for the
principal element of urban development strategy for the long term, i.e., the
creation of a viable administrative system which, as it develops, will delegate
more responsibility to the municipalities and, at the same time, maximize private
initiative.   In the short run, however,  it is expected that the central
government will continue its policy of a highly centralized system. The proposed
project supports Government and IDA strategy for the sector as it would address
a major problem of flooding in the City of Taiz, the second largest urban area
in the country, finance the implementation of recoverable infrastructure
investments, and address structural weaknesses at the central and local levels
through technical assistance and training and policy reforms.
7.    Proiect Objectives.  The main objectives of the proposed project are:
(a) to provide most needed flood control structures to protect private and public
buildings and infrastructure, and to minimize disruptions to the local economy
and reduce the risks to human life; (b) to implement a project cost recovery
mechanism at a municipal level, and to promote implementation of a national
municipal resource mobilization policy; (c) to strengthen the urban management
capabilities to the main branch offices; and (d) to strengthen MMH's
institutional capacity to address urban problems more effectively.
8.    Project Description.  The proposed project consists of the *lood control
structures which will provide the essential protection to the area of the city
(Old Town) most severely affected by floods.  The project includes: (i) the
essential flood control structures consisting of open channels, box culverts,
sediment and boulder traps at various places in wadis Seena, Al Nassar, Madam
and Al Kamet; (ii) the restoration of street pavement; the conservation of soils
through the terracing of unstable slopes; surface drainage footpaths in narrow



-3-
streets to control erosion; and land acquisition (a total of seven houses);
(iii) the purchase of equipment for the maintenance of roads and flood control
structures; (iv) the institutional strengthening of the Ministry of
Municipalities and Housing (MHM) and its main branch offices through technical
assistance; and technical assistance for project construction management; (v)
the introduction of a new municipal resource mobilization policy initiated under
ongoing urban projects ant- implementation of project cost recovery; (vi) the
hiring of consultants for the preparation of a future urban development project;
and (vii) the training of MMH's and its main branch offices staff.
9.    MMH will be the implementing agency through its Housing Directorate.  The
project will be implemented over a period of eight years. The total cost of
the project, excluding taxes and customs duties (government projects are exempt),
is estimated at US$ 22.25 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component
of US$ 15 million. A breakdown of costs, and the financing plan, are shown in
schedule A.   Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, and the
disbursement schedule, are shown in schedule B. A timetable for key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the YAR are given
in schedules C and D respectively. Maps showing the project location and the
project area are also attached (IBKD No.22142 and 22143). The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 8468-YAR dated May 25, 1990 is being distributed separately.
10.   Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following actions: (a)
acquire land and relocate about seven families, in a manner satisfactory to IDA,
by December 1990; (b) appoint project implementation and management staff by
December 1990; (c) employ advisors for technical assistance by various dates
before December 1991; (d) submit by May 1991, for IDA's review, a draft national
municipal resource mobilization policy; obtain Cabinet's approval by January
1992; and seek Parliament's approval of such a policy by September 1992; and (e)
implement, by January 1996, project cost recovery for Taiz based on a mechanism
satisfactory to IDA.
11.   Justification.  The proposed project is the least-cost solution in terms
of yielding maximum benefits and yet providing adequate safeguards for the
protection of both human life and property. The project will also benefit 1,540
low income households residing in the flood affected area, representing about
30 percent of the directly benefited population. Major economic benefits will
result from the avoidance of flood related damage to 'roperty and infrastructure.
The project will yield significant environmental bains by minimizing hazards
now posed by domestic refuse, sand, gravel and boulders which flood waters



-4.
deposit on main streets as well as by avoiding sewage overflows on streets. No
historical buildings will be affected by the proposed project. The project will
provide further institutional strengthening of NMH and its municipal branch
offices, for improving the level of service and operating efficiencies. The
proiect will also provide assistance to MMH for addressing natural disaster
prevention (including early warning systems) through appropriate planning and
development policies. The project will promote the implementation of a natiosal
municipal resource mobilization policy and introduce cost recovery on a citywide
basis. The internal economic rate of return Is 12 percent.
12.   Risks.  Two types of construction risks are foreseen, one related to the
normal construction of civil works and the other associated with floods that
could damage structures under construction and further aggravate the dangers
normally posed by such calamities.   V*th types of risks, however, will be
minimized through strict construction requirements included in the tender
specifications, and by qualified supervision. The flood control structures have
been designed with temporary provisions for use during construction. Two IDA
supervision missions per year will be scheduled to ensure that the project
implementation proceeds on schedule, and that qualified construction supervision
is provided.
13.   Recommendation.  I am Satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement . the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
